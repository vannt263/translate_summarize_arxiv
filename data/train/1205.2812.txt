    "we begin the survey by stating some of the principal problems an results regarding nodal sets and more general level sets . some of the problems are intentionally stated in vague terms that admit a number of rigorous formulations .",
    "one of the principal problems on nodal sets is to measure their hypersurface volume . in the real analytic case , donnelly - fefferman ( @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ) proved :    [ df ]    let @xmath1 be a compact real analytic riemannian manifold , with or without boundary .",
    "then there exist @xmath100 depending only on @xmath1 such that @xmath101    the bounds were conjectured by s. t. yau @xcite for all @xmath26 @xmath102 , but this remains an open problem .",
    "the lower bound was proved for all @xmath26 metrics for surfaces , i.e. for @xmath103 by brning @xcite . for general @xmath26 metrics the sharp upper and lower bounds",
    "are not known , although there has been some recent progress that we consider below .",
    "the nodal hypersurface bounds are consistent with the heuristic that @xmath12 is the analogue on a riemannian manifold of a polynomial of degree @xmath21 , since the hypersurface volume of a real algebraic variety is bounded by its degree .",
    "the equidistribution problem for nodal sets is to study the behavior of the integrals of general continuous functions @xmath104 over the nodal set . here",
    ", we normalize the delta - function on the nodal set by the conjectured surface volume of  [ area ] . more precisely :    * problem * find the weak * limits of the family of measures @xmath105 .",
    "note that in the @xmath26 case we do not even know if this family has uniformly bounded mass .",
    "the high - frequency limit is the semi - classical limit and generally signals increasing complexity in the ` topography ' of eigenfunctions .",
    "heuristics from quantum chaos suggests that eigenfunctions of quantum chaotic systems should behave like random waves .",
    "the random wave model is defined and studied in @xcite ( see  [ rwonb ] ) , and it is proved ( see theorem [ zdsm ] ) that if one picks a random sequence @xmath106 of random waves of increasing frequency , then almost surely @xmath107 i.e. their nodal sets become equidistributed with respect to the volume form on @xmath28 .",
    "hence the heuristic principle leads to the conjecture that nodal sets of eigenfunctions of quantum chaotic systems should become equidistributed according to the volume form .",
    "the conjecture for eigenfunctions ( rather than random waves ) is far beyond any current techniques and serves mainly as inspiration for studies of equidistribution of nodal sets .    a yet more speculative conjecture in quantum chaosis that the nodal sets should tend to @xmath108 curves in critical percolation .",
    "cle refers to conformal loop ensembles , which are closed curves related to @xmath109 curves .",
    "as above , this problem is motivated by a comparision to random waves , but for these the problem is also completely open . in  [ perc ]",
    "we review the heuristic principles which started in condensed matter physics @xcite before migrating to quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "it is dubious that such speculative conjectures can be studied rigorously in the forseeable future , but we include them to expose the reader to the questions that are relevant to physicists .      besides nodal sets it is of much current interest to study @xmath0 norms of eigenfunctions globally on @xmath1 and also of their restrictions to submanifolds .",
    "in fact , recent results show that nodal sets and @xmath0 norms are related .",
    "for instance , in  [ lb ] we will use the identity @xmath111 relating the @xmath110 norm of @xmath12 to a weighted integral over @xmath18 to obtain lower bounds on @xmath112 see .    obtaining lower bounds on @xmath110 norms of eigenfunctions",
    "is closely related to finding upper bounds on @xmath113 norms .",
    "the current bounds are nowhere near sharp enough to improve nodal set bounds .",
    "a closely related problem in the ` topography ' of laplace eigenfunctions @xmath12 is to determine the asymptotic distribution of their critical points @xmath114 this problem is analogous to that of measuring the hypersurface area @xmath115 of the nodal ( zero ) set of @xmath12 , but it is yet more complicated due to the instability of the critical point set as the metric varies . for a generic metric ,",
    "all eigenfunctions are morse functions and the critical point set is discrete . one may ask to count the number of critical points asymptotically as @xmath16 . but there exist metrics ( such as the flat metric on the torus , or the round metric on the sphere ) for which the eigenfunctions have critical manifolds rather than points . to get around this obstruction",
    ", we change",
    "the problem from counting critical points to counting critical values @xmath116 since a real analytic function on a compact real analytic manifold has only finitely many critical values , eigenfunctions of real analytic riemannian manifolds @xmath1 have only finitely many critical values and we can ask to count them . moreover for generic real analytic metrics , all eigenfunctions are morse functions and there exists precisely one critical point for each critical value .",
    "thus , in the generic situation , counting critical values is equivalent to counting critical points . to our knowledge , there are no results on this problem , although it is possible to bound the @xmath14-measure of @xmath117 ( see theorem @xcite ) .",
    "however @xmath118 in the generic case and in special cases where it is not zero the method is almost identical to bounds on the nodal set .",
    "thus , such results bypass all of the difficulties in counting critical values .",
    "we will present one new ( unpublished ) result which generalizes eqrefid to critical points .",
    "but the resulting identity is much more complicated than for zeros .",
    "singular points are critical points which occur on the nodal sets .",
    "we recall ( see @xcite ) that the the singular set @xmath119 satisfies @xmath120 .",
    "thus , outside of a codimension one subset , @xmath18 is a smooth manifold , and the riemannian surface measure @xmath121 on @xmath18 is well - defined .",
    "we refer to @xcite for background .",
    "it is known that in dimension two , the minimal possible area of a nodal domain of a euclidean eigenfunction is @xmath122 .",
    "this follows from the two - dimensional faber - krahn inequality , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a nodal domain in @xmath125 . in higher dimensions",
    ", the faber - krahn inequality shows that on any riemannian manifold the volume of any nodal domain is @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "another size measure of a nodal domain is its inradius @xmath127 , i.e. the radius of the largest ball contained inside the nodal domain .",
    "as can be seen from computer graphics ( see e.g. @xcite ) , there are a variety of ` types ' of nodal components . in @xcite",
    ", mangoubi proves that @xmath128 where @xmath129 ; note that eigenvalues in @xcite are denoted @xmath21 while here we denote them by @xmath37 . in dimension",
    "@xmath95 , it is known ( loc.cit . ) that @xmath130      there are two natural decompositions ( partitions ) of @xmath28 associated to an eigenfunction ( or any smooth function ) .    *",
    "( i ) * nodal domain decomposition .    first is the decomposition of @xmath28 into nodal domains of @xmath12 . as in @xcite",
    "we denote the collection of nodal domains by @xmath131 and denote a nodal domain by @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath132 when @xmath133 is a regular value of @xmath12 the level sets are smooth hypersurfaces and one can ask how many components of @xmath18 occur , how many components of the complement , the topological types of components or the combinatorics of the set of domains .",
    "when @xmath133 is a singular value , the nodal set is a singular hypersurface and can be connected but one may ask similar questions taking multiplicities of the singular points into account .    to be precise ,",
    "let @xmath134 the best - known problem is to estimate @xmath135 . according to the courant nodal domain theorem , @xmath136 . in the case of spherical harmonics , where many orthonormal bases are possible , it is better to estimate the number in terms of the eigenvalue , and the estimate has the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is a constant depending on @xmath33 . in dimension 2",
    ", pleijel used the faber - krahn theorem to improve the bound to @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the smallest zero of the @xmath142 bessel function .",
    "a wide variety of behavior is exhibited by spherical harmonics of degree @xmath143 .",
    "we review the definitions below .",
    "the even degree harmonics are equivalent to real projective plane curves of degree @xmath144 .",
    "but each point of @xmath145 corresponds to a pair of points of @xmath99 and at most one component of the nodal set is invariant under the anti - podal map . for other components ,",
    "the anti - podal map takes a component to a disjoint component .",
    "thus there are essentially twice the number of components in the nodal set as components of the associated plane curve .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , one has ;    * harnack s inequality : the number of components of any irreducible real projective plane curve is bounded by @xmath146 where @xmath33 is the genus of the curve . *",
    "if @xmath147 is a real projectove plane curve of degree @xmath143 then its genus is given by noether s formula @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the order of vanishing of @xmath12 at @xmath150 .",
    "thus , the number of components is @xmath151 for a non - singular irreducible plane curve of degree @xmath143 .",
    "curves which achieve the maximum are called @xmath28-curves .",
    "also famous are harnack curves , which are @xmath28 curves for which there exist three distinct lines @xmath152 of @xmath145 and three distinct arcs @xmath153 of the curve on one component so that @xmath154 .",
    "it follows from pleijel s bound that nodal sets of spherical harmonics can not be maximal for large @xmath143 , since half of the pleijel bound is roughly @xmath155 which is below the threshold @xmath156 for maximal curves .",
    "associated to the collection of nodal domains is its incidence graph @xmath157 , which has one vertex for each nodal domain , and one edge linking each pair of nodal domains with a common boundary component .",
    "here we assume that @xmath133 is a regular value of @xmath12 so that the nodal set is a union of embedded submanifolds .",
    "the euler characteristic of the graph is the difference beween the number of nodal domains and nodal components . in the non - singular case",
    ", one can convert the nodal decomposition into a cell decomposition by attaching a one cell between two adjacent components ,",
    "and then one has @xmath158 ( see lemma 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "the possible topological types of arrangements of nodal components of spherical harmonics is studied in @xcite .",
    "they prove that for any @xmath159 with @xmath160 even and for every set of @xmath161 disjoint closed curves whose union is invariant with respect to the antipodal map , there exists an eigenfunction whose nodal set has the topological type of the union of curves . note that these spherical harmonics have relatively few nodal domains compared to the pleijel bound .",
    "it is proved in @xcite that random spherical harmonics have @xmath162 nodal components for some ( undetermined ) @xmath163 .    * morse - smale decomposition *    for generic metrics , all eigenfunctions are morse functions @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath164 is a morse function .",
    "for each critical point @xmath147 let @xmath165 ( the stable or descending cell through p ) denote the union of the gradient flow lines which have @xmath147 as their initial point , i.e. their @xmath166-limit point .",
    "then @xmath167 is a cell of dimension @xmath168 number of negative eigenvalues of @xmath169 . by the morse - smale decomposition",
    "we mean the decomposition @xmath170 it is not a good cell decomposition in general . if we change @xmath104 to @xmath171 we get the decomposition into ascending ( unstable ) cells @xmath172 if the intersections @xmath173 are always transversal then @xmath174 is said to be transversal . in this case @xmath175 and the number of gradient curves joining two critical points whose morse index differs by 1 is finite .",
    "we are mainly interested in the stable cells of maximum dimension , i.e. basins of attraction of the gradient flow to each local minimum .",
    "we then have the partition @xmath176 this decomposition is somtimes used in condensed matter physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) and in computational shape analysis @xcite . in dimension two , the surface is partitioned into ` polygons ' defined by the basins of attraction of the local minima of @xmath177 .",
    "the boundaries of these polygons are gradient lines of @xmath177 which emanate from saddle points .",
    "the vertices occur at local maxima .",
    "an eigenfunction is a neumann eigenfunction in each basin since the boundary is formed by integral curves of @xmath178 .",
    "possibly it is ` often ' the first non - constant neumann eigenfunction ( analogously to @xmath12 being the lowest dirichlet eigenfunction in each nodal domain ) , but this does not seem obvious . hence it is not clear how to relate the global eigenvalue @xmath37 to the neumann eigenvalues of the basins , which would be useful in understanding the areas or diameters of these domains .",
    "note that @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the unit normal to @xmath181 , since @xmath182 is tangent to the boundary .",
    "in particular , the intersection @xmath183 is non - empty and is a connected hypersurface which separates @xmath184 into two components on which @xmath12 has a fixed sign . to our knowledge , there do not exist rigorous results bounding the number of local minima from above or below , i.e. there is no analogue of the courant upper bound for the number of local minima basins .",
    "it is possible to obtain statstical results on the asymptotic expected number of local minima , say for random spherical harmonics of degree @xmath143 .",
    "the methods of @xcite adapt to this problem if one replaces holomorphic szeg kernels by spectral projections ( see also @xcite . ) thus , in a statistical sense it is much simpler to count the number of  neumann domains \" or morse - smale basins than to count nodal domains as in @xcite .",
    "before proceeding to rigorous results , we go over a number of explicitly solvable examples . almost by definition , they are highly non - generic and in fact represent the eigenfunctions of quantum integrable systems . aside from being explicitly solvable ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of this section are extremals for a number of problems .",
    "the basic real valued eigenfunctions are @xmath185 or @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) on the flat torus @xmath188 .",
    "the zero set consists of the hyperplanes @xmath189 mod @xmath190 or in other words @xmath191 .",
    "thus the normalized delta function @xmath192 tends to uniform distribution along rays in the lattice @xmath193 .",
    "the lattice arises as the joint spectrum of the commuting operators @xmath194 and is a feature of quantum integrable systems .",
    "the critical point equation for @xmath186 is @xmath195 and is thus the same as the nodal equation . in particular ,",
    "the critical point sets are hypersurfaces in this case .",
    "there is just one critical value @xmath196 .    instead of the square torus",
    "we could consider @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a lattice of full rank .",
    "then the joint spectrum becomes the dual lattice @xmath199 and the eigenfunctions are @xmath200 with @xmath201 .    the real eigenspace @xmath202 and other rational lattices . in that case",
    ", one may take linear combinations of the basic eigenfunctions and study their nodal and critcal point sets . for background , some recent results and further references we refer to @xcite .",
    "the spectral decomposition for the laplacian is the orthogonal sum of the spaces of spherical harmonics of degree @xmath143 , @xmath203 the eigenvalues are given by @xmath204 and the multiplicities are given by @xmath205 . a standard basis is given by the ( complex valued ) spherical harmonics @xmath206 which transform by @xmath207 under rotations preserving the poles .    the @xmath206 are complex valued , so we study the nodal sets of their real and imaginary parts .",
    "they are separable , i.e. factor as @xmath208 ( resp .",
    "@xmath209 where @xmath210 is an associated legendre function .",
    "thus the nodal sets of these special eigenfunctions form a checkerboard pattern that can be explicitly determined from the known behavior of zeros of associated legendre functions .",
    "see the first image in the illustration below",
    ".        among the basic spherical harmonics , there are two special ones : the zonal spherical harmonics ( i.e. the rotationally invariant harmonics ) and the highest weight spherical harmonics .",
    "their nodal sets and intensity plots are graphed in the bottom two images , respectively .",
    "since the zonal spherical harmonics @xmath211 on @xmath99 are real - valued and rotationally invariant , their zero sets consist of a union of circles , i.e. orbits of the @xmath212 rotation action around the third axis .",
    "it is well known that @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is the @xmath143th legendre function and the normalizing constant is chosen so that @xmath215 , i.e. @xmath216 so that @xmath217 . all zeros of @xmath218 are real and it has @xmath143 zeros in @xmath219 $ ] .",
    "it is classical that the zeros @xmath220 of @xmath221 in @xmath222 become uniformly distributed with respect to @xmath223 @xcite .",
    "it is also known that @xmath214 has @xmath224 distinct critical points @xcite and so the critical points of @xmath225 is a union of @xmath224 lattitude circles .",
    "we now consider real or imaginary parts of highest weight spherical harmonics @xmath226 . up to a scalar multiple , @xmath227 as a harmonic polynomial on @xmath228 .",
    "it is an example of a gaussian beams along a closed geodesic @xmath88 ( such as exist on equators of convex surfaces of revolution ) .",
    "see @xcite for background on gaussian beams on riemannian manifolds .",
    "the real and imaginary parts are of the form @xmath229 where @xmath230 is a constant multiple of @xmath231 so @xmath232 the factors @xmath233 have @xmath143 zeros on @xmath234 .",
    "the legendre funtions satisfy the recursion relation @xmath235 with @xmath236 and therefore have no real zeros away from the poles .",
    "thus , the nodal set consists of @xmath143 circles of longitude with equally spaced intersections with the equator .",
    "the critical points are solutions of the pair of equations @xmath237 .",
    "since @xmath238 has no zeros away from the poles , the second equation forces the zeros to occur at zeros of @xmath239 .",
    "but then @xmath240 so the zeros must occur at the zeros of @xmath241 .",
    "the critical points only occur when @xmath242 or @xmath243 on @xmath222",
    ". there are critical points at the poles where @xmath244 vanishes to order @xmath143 and there is a local maximum at the value @xmath245 of the equator .",
    "thus , @xmath246 has @xmath144 isolated critical points on the equator and multiple critical points at the poles .",
    "we note that @xmath247 is a gaussian bump with peak along the equator in the radial direction .",
    "its radial gaussian decay implies that it extremely small outside a @xmath248 tube around the equator .",
    "the complement of this tube is known in physics as the classically forbidden region .",
    "we see that the nodal set stretches a long distance into the classically forbidden region .",
    "this creates problems for nodal estimates since exponentially small values ( in terms of the eigenvalue ) are hard to distinguish from zeros . on the other hand",
    ", it has only two ( highly multiple ) critical points away from the equator .      the examples above exhibit quite disparate behavior but all are eigenfunctions of quantum integrable systems .",
    "we do not review the general results in this case but plan to treat this case in an article in preparation @xcite .",
    "we now contrast the nodal set behavior with that of random spherical harmonics ( left ) and a chaotic billiard domain ( the graphics are due to e. j. heller ) .",
    "in this section we review some recent lower bounds on @xmath38 from @xcite .",

    "we interpret their @xmath1172 as the density of @xmath1173 with respect to @xmath1174 on @xmath1175 .",
    "we thus interpret their conjecture as saying that a unique weak * limit of this family of measures exists and has a density relative to @xmath1174 with a power law decay as above .",
    "the claims are based in part on scaling properties of the contour ensemble .",
    "they also are based in part on the expectation that , at ` criticality ' , the key percolation ` exponents ' of power laws are universal and therefore should be the same for the discrete and continuum percolation theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite , the authors suggest that when a certain roughness exponent @xmath79 vanishes ( the critical models ) , the continuum problem is related to the four - state potts model .",

    "they claim that @xmath1182 and @xmath1183 . as a result , @xmath1184 . from the mapping to the four - state potts model , they conclude that @xmath1185",
    ".    there exist rigorous results in @xcite relating discretizations of the gaussian free field ( rather than high frequency truncations ) to the percolation models .",
    "they prove that in various senses , the zero set of the discrete gaussian free field tends to an @xmath1186 curve .",
    "it does not seem to be known at present if zero sets of the high frequency truncation of the gaussian free field also tends in the same sense to an @xmath1186 curve .",
    "note that the sle curves are interfaces and that one must select one component of the zero set that should tend to an sle curve . there might exist modified conjectures regarding cle curves .    to determine the ` critical exponents ' in continuum percolation , it is tempting to find a way to ` map ' the continuum problem to a discrete percolation model . a geometric ` map ' from a random wave to a graph is to associate to the random function its morse - smale decomposition , known in the physics literature as the  morse skeleton \" ( see  [ decomp ] or @xcite for an extensive exposition ) . as discussed in @xcite , and as illustrated in figure 10 of @xcite , the morse complex of the random function plays the role of the lattice in lattice percolation theory .",
    "we now consider riemannian random waves of asymtotically fixed frequency @xmath21 , such as random spherical harmonics of fixed degree or euclidean random plane waves of fixed eigenvalue . in this case",
    "the weight is a delta function at the frequency .",
    "one would expect different behavior in the level sets since only one frequency is involved rather than the superposition of waves of all frequencies @xmath822 .",
    "a recent exposition in the specific setting of random euclidean eigenfunctions of fixed frequency is given by @xcite .",
    "the level sets play the role of open paths .",
    "super - level sets are compared to clusters of sites in a critical 2d percolation model , such as bond percolation on a lattice .",
    "each site may of the percolation model may be visualized as a disc of area @xmath1187 , i.e. as a small component .",
    "the nodal domains may be thought of as connected clusters of a number @xmath2 such discs . since nodal domains are connected components in which the eigenfunction is either positive @xmath1188 or negative @xmath1189 , they are analogous to clusters of ` open ' or ` closed ' vertices .",
    "the main conjectures in this fixed frequency ensemble are due to e. bogolmony and c. schmidt @xcite .",
    "they conjecture that the continuum percolation problem should belong to the same universality class as the potts model at a certain critical point ( where @xmath1176 is related to a certain temperature ) for a large rectangular lattice and that the nodal lines in the @xmath1190 limit tend to @xmath1191 curves .",
    "this is similar to the predictions of @xcite but for a very different ensemble where there is little apriori reason to expect conformal invariance in the limit .",
    "there are parallel conjectures in @xcite for zero - vorticity isolines in 2d turbulence , which are also conjectured to tend to @xmath1191 curves .",
    "they remark ( page 127 ) that this limit is surprising since continuous percolation models assume short - correlations in the height functions whereas the vorticity field correlations decay only like @xmath1192 .",
    "they write ,  when the pair correlation function falls off slower than @xmath1193 , the system is not expected generally to belong to the universality class of uncorrelated percolation and to be conformally invariant \" .",
    "the same remarks apply to the fixed frequency ensemble , where the correlation function is the spectral projection @xmath1194}(x , y)$ ] for a fixed frequency . in this case , the correlations decay quite slowly as @xmath1195 ; we refer to @xcite for this background and also for an argument why the nodal sets should nevertheless resemble conformally invariant @xmath1196 curves",
    ".    if the nodal lines in the fixed frequency model are equivalent to the critical percolation model , then the ` probability ' of finding a nodal domain of area @xmath374 should decay like @xmath1197 where @xmath1198 ( see @xcite , p. 52",
    "for the percolation theory result ) . under some shape assumptions adopted in @xcite ,",
    "it is equivalent that the probability of finding clusters consisting of @xmath2 discs is of order @xmath1199 . for random spherical harmonics",
    ", one may ask for the probability that a spherical harmonic of degree @xmath143 has size @xmath2 . for a fixed @xmath1200 with simple eigenvalues ,",
    "this notion of probability from percolation theory does not make sense , but we might assume that the number of of nodal components is of order @xmath37 and ask what proportion of the nodal components has size @xmath379 . to obtain a percolating nodal line , one would need a cluster with @xmath1201 sites , and thus the proportion of such nodal components to the total number would be of order @xmath1202 .",
    "thus , if there are @xmath1203 total components , the number of such components would be around @xmath1204 , so the model seems to predict that such macroscopic nodal lines are quite rare .",

    "<S> this motivates the study of gaussian random wave models for eigenfunctions , and suggests that in the ` chaotic case ' nodal sets should be asympotically uniformly distributed . </S>",
    "<S> + when @xmath30 is completely integrable , model eigenfunctions are highly localized and their nodal sets are often exhibit quite regular patterns . the latter heuristic is not necessarily expected when there exist high multiplicities , as for rational flat tori , and then some weaker randomness can enter .    both of these general intuitions lead to predictions about nodal sets and critical point sets . </S>",
    "<S> most of the predictions are well beyond current or forseeable techniques to settle . </S>",
    "<S> a principal theme of this survey is that the analogues of such ` wild ' predictions can sometimes be proved for real analytic @xmath1 if one analytically continues eigenfunctions to the complexification of @xmath28 and studies complex nodal sets instead of real ones .    _ as with algebraic varieties , nodal sets in the real analytic case are better behaved in the complex domain than the real domain . </S>",
    "<S> that is , zero sets of analytic continuations of eigenfunctions to the complexification of @xmath28 behave like complex algebraic varieties and also reflect the dynamics of the geodesic flow . _    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the complexification of @xmath28 can be identified with a neighborhood of the zero - section of the phase space @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> that is one reason why dynamics of the geodesic flow has greater impact on the complex nodal set .    </S>",
    "<S> we will exhibit a number of relatively recent results ( some unpublished elsewhere ) which justify this viewpoint :    * theorem [ bnp ] , which shows that complex methods can be used to give upper bounds on the number of nodal components of dirichlet or neumann eigenfunctions which  touch the boundary \" of a real analytic plane domain . * theorem [ zero ] on the limit distribution of the normalized currents of integration @xmath32\\ ] ] over the complex zero sets of `` ergodic eigenfunctions '' in the complex domain . </S>",
    "<S> * theorem [ zmeasure ] and corollary [ zdsm ] , which show that the similar currents for analytic continuations of `` riemannian random waves '' tend to the same limit almost surely . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the prediction that zero sets of ergodic eigenfunctions agrees with that of random waves is correct in the complex domain . * sharper results on the distribution of intersections points of nodal sets and geodesics on complexified real analytic surfaces ( theorem [ maincor ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of nodal sets in the complex domain is based on the use of complex fourier integral techniques ( i.e. generalized paley - wiener theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> the principal tools are the analytic continuation of the poisson - wave kernel and the szeg kernel in the complex domain . </S>",
    "<S> they become fourier integral operators with complex phase and with wave fronts along the complexified geodesic flow . </S>",
    "<S> one can read off the growth properties of complexified eigenfunctions from mapping properties of such operators . </S>",
    "<S> log moduli of complexified spectral projectors are asymptotically extremal pluri - subharmonic functions for all @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas are the basis of the articles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such ideas have antecedents in work of s. bernstein , baouendi- goulaouic , and donnelly - fefferman , guillemin , f.h . </S>",
    "<S> lin ( among others ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the focus on complex nodal sets only makes sense for real analytic @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that one can study `` almost analytic extensions '' of eigenfunctions for general @xmath26 metrics in a similar spirit , but this is just a speculation and certain key methods break down when @xmath33 is not real analytic . </S>",
    "<S> hence the results in the @xmath26 case are much less precise than in the real analytic case .    </S>",
    "<S> it should also be mentioned that much work on eigenfunctions concerns ground states , i.e. the first and second eigenfunctions . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we do not have the space or expertise to review the results on ground states in this survey . for a sample </S>",
    "<S> we refer to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , many if not all of the techniques and results surveyed here have generalizations to schrdinger operators @xmath34 . for the sake of brevity </S>",
    "<S> we confine the discussion to the laplacian .      </S>",
    "<S> the first notational issue is whether to choose @xmath23 to be the positive or negative laplacian . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional choice @xmath35 makes @xmath23 is negative , but many authors call @xmath36 the laplacian to avoid the minus signs . also , the metric @xmath33 is often fixed and is dropped from the notation .    </S>",
    "<S> a less traditional choice is to denote eigenvalues by @xmath37 rather than @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a common convention in microlocal analysis and so we adopt it here . </S>",
    "<S> but we warn that @xmath21 is often used to denote @xmath8-eigenvalues as is @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we sometimes denote eigenfunctions of eigenvalue @xmath24 by @xmath12 when we only wish to emphasize the corresponding eigenvalue and do not need @xmath12 to be part of an orthonormal basis . for instance , when @xmath23 has multiplicities as on the standard sphere or rational torus , there are many possible orthonormal bases . but estimates on @xmath38 do not depend on whether @xmath12 is included in the orthonormal basis .      </S>",
    "<S> thanks to c. d. sogge and b. shiffman for helpful comments on the exposition , and to s. dyatlov for a stimulating discussion of @xmath22 quantum ergodicity . </S>"
