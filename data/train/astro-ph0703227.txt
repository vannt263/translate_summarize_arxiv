    "it is too early to conclude that a real , inverse relation exists between the ca-48 shifts and surface field ( see fig .",

    "overall fits of the cores and broad wings of @xmath18498 in @xmath17 equ and @xmath18542 in hd 51684 required models including stratification for two of our stars .",
