    "in recent years , the observation that entanglement may play an important role at a quantum phase transition  @xcite has motivated intensive research on the characterization of critical phenomena via quantum information concepts . in this direction ,",
    "conformal invariance has brought valuable information about the behavior of block entanglement , as measured by the von neumann entropy , in critical models . indeed ,",
    "conformal field theory ( cft ) has been used as a powerful tool to determine universal properties of entanglement .",
    "remarkably , it was shown that the entanglement entropy obeys a universal logarithmic scaling law for one - dimensional critical models both at zero and finite temperatures  @xcite , which is governed by the central charge of the associated cft .",
    "moreover , corrections to the entanglement entropy due to finite size effects have also been considered  @xcite for periodic and open boundary conditions .",
    "together with approximative methods such as renormalization group ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite , cft has been settled as one of the most promising approaches for investigating the behavior of entanglement in many - body quantum critical systems .    in this work",

    "more specifically , our approach will be based on the statement that finite size corrections to the ground state expectation values of arbitrary observables are ruled by conformal invariance .",
    "this conclusion is indeed a consequence of two results : ( 1 ) finite size corrections to the energy spectrum of a critical theory are determined by conformal invariance  @xcite ; ( 2 ) dft techniques imply that , under certain conditions discussed below , general observables can be evaluated as a function of the first derivative of the ground state energy with respect to a hamiltonian coupling parameter  @xcite .",
    "we then simultaneously apply these two results to obtain the finite size corrections to ground state entanglement in critical models . as a by - product , conformal invariance determines the structure of entanglement in the presence of extra symmetries for certain higher energy states , which are the lowest energy states in each symmetrically decoupled subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "for instance , if the hamiltonian is translationally invariant and has a @xmath3 symmetry due to its commutation with the magnetization operator , we can split out the hilbert space in sectors of fixed momentum and magnetization .",
    "more generally , we will also show that all conformal towers formed by an infinite number of excited states ( as the size of the system @xmath0 ) exhibit a unique pattern of entanglement , which differ only at leading order @xmath1 .",
    "this will be based on a generalization of the hk theorem for individual states belonging to conformal towers of critical systems .",
    "finite size corrections to entanglement in these excited states will obey a universal structure , given by the anomalous dimensions of the primary operators of the theory .",
