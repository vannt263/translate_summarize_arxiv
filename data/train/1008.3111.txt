    "a powerful theoretical method for describing or mathematically constructing a class of spherically symmetric wormholes from black - hole spacetimes was proposed by visser in 1989 @xcite .",
    "this type of wormhole , constructed by the so - called cut - and - paste technique , is commonly known as a _ thin - shell wormhole _ , since the construction calls for grafting two black - hole spacetimes together .",
    "the junction surface is a three - dimensional thin shell .",
    "the cut - and - paste technique is now considered standard .    while there had already been a number of forerunners , the concept of a traversable wormhole was proposed by morris and thorne in 1988 @xcite .",
    "ten years later a renewed interest was sparked by the discovery that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion @xcite : @xmath4 in the friedmann equation @xmath5 .",
    "( our units are taken to be those in which @xmath6 . )",
    "the acceleration is caused by a negative pressure _ dark energy _ with equation of state ( eos ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "a value of @xmath8 is required for an accelerated expansion , while @xmath10 corresponds to a cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath11 is referred to as _ phantom energy _ and leads to a violation of the null energy condition , a primary prerequisite for the existence of wormholes .",
    "wormholes may also be supported by a generalized chaplygin gas @xcite whose eos is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in a thin - shell wormhole",
    "the exotic matter is confined to the thin shell .",
    "this suggests assigning an equation of state to the exotic matter on the shell .",
    "eiroa @xcite used the above generalized chaplygin eos @xmath15 , where @xmath2 is the ( negative ) energy - density of the shell and @xmath3 the lateral presssure , to perform a stability analysis for linearized radial perturbations . in this paper",
    "we will consider , analogously , the eos @xmath16 , @xmath1 , which will be called a _",
    "phantom - like _ equation of state .",
    "the stability analysis will be carried out for several spacetimes : schwarzschild , de sitter and anti de sitter , reissner - nordstrm , and regular charged black hole spacetimes , as well as black holes in dilaton and generalized dilaton - axion gravity .",
    "the phantom - like equation of state yields explicit closed - form expressions for @xmath2 .",
    "our approach to the stability analysis is therefore different from eiroa s .",
    "our starting point is the spherically symmetric metric @xcite @xmath17^{-1}dr^2    + h(r)(d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are positive functions of @xmath20 and @xmath19 is increasing .",
    "( in sections iii - vi , @xmath21 . ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the construction begins with two copies of a black - hole spacetime and removing from each the four - dimensional region @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ( outer ) event horizon of the black hole .",
    "now identify ( in the sense of topology ) the time - like hypersurfaces @xmath24 the resulting manifold is geodesically complete and possesses two asymptotically flat regions connected by a throat .",
    "next , we use the lanczos equations @xcite @xmath25     -\\delta^i_{\\phantom{i}j}[k]\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath26=k^{+}_{ij}-k^{-}_{ij}$ ] and @xmath27 $ ] is the trace of @xmath28 . in terms of the surface energy - density @xmath2 and the surface pressure @xmath3 , @xmath29 .",
    "the lanczos equations now yield @xmath30\\ ] ] and @xmath31      + [ k^\\theta_{\\phantom{\\theta}\\theta}]\\right).\\ ] ]    a dynamic analysis can be obtained by letting the radius @xmath32 be a function of time @xcite . as a result , @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "since @xmath2 is negative on the shell , we are dealing with exotic matter .",
    "in fact , the weak energy condition ( wec ) is obviously violated since the radial pressure @xmath35 is zero for a thin shell . ( the wec requires the stress - energy tensor @xmath36 to obey @xmath37 for all time - like vectors and , by continuity , all null vectors . ) so for the radial outgoing null vector @xmath38 , we therefore have @xmath39 .",
    "for our first case , the schwarzschild spacetime , @xmath21 in line element ( [ e : line ] ) , as noted earlier . also , recall that the radius @xmath32 is a function of time .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath3 and @xmath2 obey the conservation equation @xmath40 ( in eqs .",
    "( [ e : sigma ] ) and ( [ e : p ] ) , the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath41 . ) the equation can be written in the form @xmath42    for a static configuration of radius @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , we will consider linearized fluctuations around a static solution characterized by the constants @xmath43 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "given the eos @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( [ e : conservation ] ) can be solved by separation of variables to yield @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "so the solution is @xmath50    next , we rearrange eq .",

    "the configuration is in stable equilibrium if @xmath58 .",

    "it follows that @xmath60 from eq .",

    "we obtain the intermediate result @xmath72 since the schwarzschild black hole has an event horizon at @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and we conclude that the inequality @xmath58 can only be satisfied if @xmath75 as a result , there are no stable solutions .    to allow a comparison to some of the other cases , let us choose ( arbitrarily ) @xmath76 , as a result of which @xmath77 , and plot @xmath52 against @xmath78 , as shown in fig . 1 .    the more general analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite depends on the parameter @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is usually interpreted as the speed of sound , so that @xmath81 .",
    "there are no stable solutions in this range .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since we are dealing with exotic matter , this assumption may be questioned , that is , @xmath82 may be just a convenient parameter . in that case , some stable configurations may not be out of question . our additional assumption , the eos @xmath16 on the shell , eliminates this possibility .",
    "in the presence of a cosmological constant , @xmath83 . for the de sitter case , @xmath84 . to keep @xmath18 from becoming negative , we must have @xmath85 .",
    "this condition results in two event horizons , where the inner horizon is between @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . )",

    "it is easy to show analytically that @xmath99 ; in fact , @xmath100 is a minimum .",
    "we may also plot @xmath101 against @xmath78 , as shown in fig .",
    "so for this case , the condition @xmath58 can not be met ( since we must have @xmath85 ) , and we get only unstable solutions . plotting @xmath52 around @xmath76 yields a graph that is very similar to the graph in fig . 1 .    for the second case , @xmath102 in inequality ( [ e : updesitter ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath103<\\frac{1}{a_0/m}.\\ ] ] if @xmath104 , then the left side is negative , and the condition is automatically satisfied . if @xmath98 , then , according to fig .",
    "2 , @xmath105 , the region below the graph .",
    "so we conclude that in the second case , the wormholes are stable .    for comparison ,",
    "let us choose @xmath76 again and @xmath106 , resulting in @xmath107 .",
    "the plot of @xmath52 against @xmath78 is shown in fig .",
    "3 .    in summary , in the schwarzschild - de sitter case , the thin - shell wormholes are stable if , and only if , @xmath108      to study the case @xmath109 , we return to inequality ( [ e : updesitter ] ) and consider first a negative denominator : @xmath110 solving for @xmath101 , we obtain @xmath111 since @xmath112 , we conclude that @xmath113 , so that this case can not arise .    reversing the sense of the inequality",
