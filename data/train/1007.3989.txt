    "detailed observations of the earliest galaxies are necessary if we are to form a complete picture of galaxy formation and evolution . while increasing numbers of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies are being discovered at @xmath4 and above ( within @xmath101gyr of the big bang ) , almost all are discovered through rest - frame uv emission originating from strong ongoing star formation .",
    "unfortunately , this tells us little about the ( potentially dominant ) uv - dark baryonic component of these galaxies and consequently limits our understanding of star formation in the high-@xmath11 universe .",

    "* ) , we know little about their gas content , which is a crucial diagnostic of the duration of the ongoing starburst and of the nature of the lbgs themselves .",
    "the galaxies have unobscured star formation rates of a few @xmath13m@xmath14yr@xmath15 arising from regions with a typical surface area of @xmath16kpc@xmath17 .",
    "the strong wind generated by such a starburst can potentially limit the available fuel for continuing star formation . clearly , the amount of gas available to the ongoing starburst is key to an understanding of the nature of the burst and the future of star formation activity within the system .",
    "hst imaging of @xmath4 lbgs ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that many sytems have multiple uv components and extended , distorted morphologies on scales of a kpc or more . with the available optical and near - ir data , it is currently impossible to determine whether such structures imply that the lbgs originate in mergers , or are individual super starburst regions embedded in much larger uv - dark systems , as found in low redshift lyman break analogues ( @xcite , see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "if the latter scenario is correct , then one would expect considerably more cool and cold gas present in the immediate environment of the lbgs than is present in the stellar mass produced by the ongoing starbursts .",

    "two of the ten 40 arcmin@xmath18 ergs pointings display a large over - density of spectroscopically - confirmed uv bright sources over narrow ( @xmath19 ) redshift ranges .",
    "the first of these was the subject of a previous letter @xcite in which we discussed the identification of a uv - dark molecular line emitter at @xmath0 . here , we target one field , j1054.4 - 1245 , which contains many spectroscopically - confirmed lbgs in a two - arcminute diameter region . as in our previous work , we target the field using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , but this time use the new compact array broadband backend ( cabb ) which probes a @xmath20 redshift range in a single exposure ( at 38ghz ) . this is approximately 15 times broader than in our first work and easily encompasses the entire velocity range probed by the lbg over - density .    throughout this paper , unless otherwise stated , all magnitudes are on the ab scale , and the cosmology used is _ _ h__@xmath21=70kms@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath22 = 0.7 and @xmath23 = 0.3 .",
    "observations were carried out with the atca over two separate runs , one in may 2009 as part of project c1954 and another in march 2010 as part of project c2297 .",
    "the primary goal of the project was to search for uv - dark molecular line emitters across our target field and the results of that study will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the array was in the compact h168 configuration , using both north - south and east - west baselines .",
    "we utilized the new cabb correlator with two intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , each with 2ghz/2048 channel configurations .",
    "we targeted co(2 - 1 ) and co(1 - 0 ) transitions at the lbg over - density redshift .",
    "for co(2 - 1 ) transitions we tuned the if bands to 36.70 ghz and 38.72 ghz to allow a simultaneous survey range of @xmath24 .",
    "we bin six adjacent 1 mhz channels to increase signal to noise , and we obtain a spectral resolution of @xmath1047 km s@xmath15 . during the first run , observations were taken in six 8 hour periods between 2009 may 1 and 7 .",
    "three pointings were observed in order to target the maximum possible number of lbgs in the field . during the second run two additional pointings",
    "were observed in four 8 hour periods between 2010 march 21 and 23 ( see figure [ fig : field_plot ] ) . a nearby bright source , pks1054 - 188 ,",
    "was observed every 15 minutes to determine the phase stability and the pointing accuracy was was checked every hour .",
    "primary flux calibration was carried out on the standard atca calibration source , pks1934 - 638 , each night .",
    "the half - power - beam - width ( hpbw ) of the atca at @xmath1037 ghz is 74@xmath25 and the restoring beam , for natural weighting and this configuration , is 7.3@xmath26 . for co(1 - 0 ) transitions we tuned the if bands to 19.12 ghz and 21.12 ghz giving redshift coverage of @xmath27 .",
    "we observed a single pointing for two nights on 2009 may 8 to 9 , encompassing all five @xmath1037ghz pointings ( see figure [ fig : field_plot ] ) .",
    "as before , we bin three adjacent 1 mhz channels to increase signal to noise which gives a resolution of @xmath1047 km s@xmath15 ( matching the velocity resolution of our high frequency data ) , use nearby source 1054 - 188 for secondary flux calibration and pks1934 - 638 for primary flux calibration .",
    "the hpbw at @xmath1020 ghz is 2.5@xmath28 and the restoring beam is 15.9@xmath29 . at @xmath305",
    "this corresponds to a beam size of @xmath31kpc .",
    "we expect any detectable line emission from our sources to have velocity width @xmath10150 km s@xmath15 ( the only two known high redshift , non agn , co line - emitting galaxies at @xmath0 have line widths of @xmath10160 km s@xmath15 , @xcite and @xmath10110 km s@xmath15 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we require detections to be statistically significant ( @xmath32 ) in each of 3 adjacent channels . therefore by binning our data to 3mhz and and 6mhz at the lower and higher frequency settings ,",
    "a detection in three adjacent bins will correspond to a @xmath10150 km s@xmath15-wide line .",
    "total integration times were 16 hours at each frequency giving an rms noise of @xmath100.11mjy / beam at 19 ghz and @xmath100.17mjy / beam at 37ghz in each 47 km s@xmath15 channel .",
    "our observations target eight spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath4 lbgs which are spatially distributed within the half power beam widths of individual pointings at both @xmath1037ghz and @xmath1019ghz .",
    "seven lie in the 3-dimensional over - density ( @xmath33 ) of lbgs in the larger ergs field and the eighth is at slightly higher redshift ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "none of these galaxies show detectable line or continuum emission at either of the redshifted co transitions targeted . for the line emission ,",
    "each extracted 1-dimensional spectrum was examined for emission at the frequency expected for redshifted co emission ( using the redshift determined from either ly@xmath35 emission or the break at ly@xmath35 detected in optical spectroscopy @xcite ) .",
    "however , in a study of @xmath36 star forming galaxies , @xcite show that the ly@xmath35 redshift can differ from the systematic redshift derived from interstellar absorption lines and other emission lines by up to @xmath37kms@xmath15 , with the ly@xmath35 redshift being systematically higher .",
    "consequently , we additionally determined limits to any line flux at frequencies corresponding to velocity offsets of up to @xmath38kms@xmath15 shortward of the ly@xmath35-derived value ( see figure [ fig : indu_lbg ] ) .    to search for co line emission ,",
    "47 kms@xmath15-wide slices of the data cube were extracted and the root - mean - square variation was ascertained in each for a region of @xmath3920@xmath4020 arcsec box centred on the position of each lbg .",
    "any real emission line is likely to be broader than 50 km  s@xmath15 as noted above .",
    "consequently , we define a detection as three consecutive 47 kms@xmath15 spectral bins at least 2@xmath41 above zero flux in the region between 0 and 600 kms@xmath15 shortward of the ly@xmath35 redshift . using these criteria ,",
    "no individual source was detected .",
    "to determine a characteristic line - limit for each source , eleven values of the rms over three consecutive bins in the same 0 to 600 kms@xmath15 region were obtained . as the variation between these was small , we took the average value of these as characteristic of a given source .",
    "this results in a typical flux limit of @xmath42 mjy km  s@xmath15 for the co(2 - 1 ) lines and @xmath43 mjy km  s@xmath15 for the co(1 - 0 ) line .",
    "these correspond to luminosity limits in each line of typically @xmath44 k km s@xmath15 pc@xmath18 at @xmath45 for co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath46 k km s@xmath15 pc@xmath18 for co(1 - 0 ) @xcite . converting this to a limit on the molecular gas mass requires an appropriate conversion factor . in the absence of a directly measured value at the highest redshifts , we use the commonly - used conversion factor derived from local strongly star forming galaxies @xcite of m@xmath47/l@xmath48m@xmath7 ( kkm",
    "s@xmath15pc@xmath17)@xmath15 given the strength of the starbursts in these lbgs .",
    "assuming that the emitting medium is optically thick and thermalized , the line luminosity is independent of transition ( _ i.e. _ l@xmath49(2 - 1)=l@xmath49(1 - 0 ) , @xcite ) . the typical co(2 - 1 )",
    "limit places a constraint on the gas mass of m@xmath50 m@xmath7 .",
    "this is comparable to the stellar mass content of lbgs at this redshift ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the constraint placed by the co(1 - 0 ) line is a factor of two to four times higher depending upon the source .    of course , if the line width is much narrower than we assumed , we may have missed emission using these criteria . however , we note that the above flux and luminosity limits are appropriate for a 6@xmath41 non - detection of any emission confined to a single channel .",
    "in fact , no channel in the 600 kms@xmath15 range in any of the spectra deviates from zero by more than 2.5@xmath41 , so the limit quoted above is robust .",

    "the limits on the flux , line luminosity and h@xmath3 mass of a `` typical '' lbg are tightened to @xmath58 mjy km  s@xmath15 , @xmath59 k",
    "km s@xmath15 pc@xmath18 and m@xmath60 m@xmath7 at @xmath61 ( 2@xmath41 ) .    however , this process is not completely straightforward as the true redshifts for the sources may not exactly match the ly@xmath35-derived values , as noted above .",
    "the offsets between the ly@xmath35 and true values may vary by @xmath62 km  s@xmath15 between objects .",
    "consequently , any combination of weak lines may be averaged in such a way that they are smeared out in frequency and do not reinforce each other to become a detection in the average spectrum . to explore this we made multiple average spectra , varying the relative offset in redshift between each spectrum in seven steps , + 150 , + 100 , + 50 , 0 , -50 , -100 and -150 kms@xmath15 , in total @xmath63 or 823543 average spectra .",
    "we then take the ten flux limits in the -600 to 0 km  s@xmath15 region from each spectrum .",
    "the distribution of flux limits for these spectra are shown in figure [ fig_limits ] .",
    "as can be seen , using the ly@xmath35 redshifts does not significantly underestimate the true value of the limit .",
    "relative to the eighth spectrum .",
    "the dashed line shows the flux limit for the eight spectra stacked at the optically - derived redshifts .",
    "the distribution of flux limits is gaussian - distributed as expected given the noise characteristics of individual velocity channels . ]    for completeness , we carried out the same procedure , but looking at features contained within a single bin as would be the case for extremely narrow lines .",
    "the highest flux in one of the -600 to 0 kms@xmath15 bins in the average spectra was 12.6 mjy kms@xmath15 ( consistent with the noise characteristics given the 823543 different realisations ) , considerably less than the above limit of @xmath58 mjy kms@xmath15 and so we consider that limit to be robust even for a very narrow line .",
    "assuming that the conversion between co luminosity and h@xmath3 mass determined by @xcite is applicable ( the intensity of the starbursts in these lbg indicates that it is ) , the non - detection of co emission from these lbgs places interesting constraints on their nature .",
    "the similarity between the typical stellar masses of such systems as determined from multiband photometry of @xmath4 lbgs @xcite , and the limit to their typical h@xmath3 mass ( a few times larger ) would indicate that the systems are observed about half way through the ongoing burst of star formation assuming that the current star formation rate is maintained and the conversions from gas to stars approaches @xmath9 per cent efficiency . however , the efficiency with which gas is converted into stars is typically no more than ten per cent , and potentially only one or two per cent @xcite , thus suggesting that these sources are much more than halfway through their life cycle .",
    "this is unsurprising as timescales of @xmath10 10 myrs will be required to produce and sustain the observed uv continuum fluxes from a population of o and b stars .",
    "dividing the limiting gas mass by the typical star formation rate from @xcite gives a timescale of @xmath64myr , with the typical age of a stellar population determined by @xcite being a few tens of myr .",
    "as this implicitly assumes an unrealistic complete transformation of gas into stars , even if the co luminosity to h@xmath3 conversion factor is higher than the solomon & vanden bout value , this is a robust upper limit to the star formation timescale at this level of activity .",
    "the apparent lack of a comparatively large reservoir of molecular gas in and around the uv - luminous system strongly argues against the lbgs being unobscured super starbursts embedded in much more massive and extended underlying systems .",
    "any such system should contain sufficiently large amounts of enriched molecular gas to be detectable here .",
    "consequently , it provides support for the alternative hypothesis of a merger origin for at least those systems with multiple spatially - distributed uv luminous components .",
    "if all @xmath4 lbgs are triggered by mergers with other galaxies , our lack of a single detection implies that few involve comparatively massive systems with substantial obscured star formation or large amounts of processed molecular gas .",
    "additionally , the most active phases of a merger occur when the gas has been consumed and is concentrated in the central regions of the systems .",
    "if lbgs are triggered by mergers , and given the need to build uv continuum fluxes through star formation , this may take substantial time . therefore in this model lbgs",
    "may only be detectable ( in the rest frame uv ) towards the end of their starbursts . observed luminous starburst galaxies at high-@xmath11 typically have short gas depletion times relative to their ages , similar to that seen in these sources .",
    "the lack of detectable 850 micron continuum flux in apex / laboca observations of different but essentially similar lbgs @xcite gives further support to this model . as noted in @xcite the conversions from continuum flux limits to star formation rates are currently ambiguous .",
    "however , the lack of detectable dust emission from these similar sources lends support to the idea that they do not have large reservoirs of cool and cold material , thus strengthening the idea that these sources are not embedded in more massive obscured systems .",
    "there has been recent discussion @xcite of whether there should be deviation away from the low - redshift schmidt - kennicutt ( sk ) relation @xcite at high redshift .",
    "here we note that for unobscured star formation rates of a few tens of solar masses per year arising from regions of approximately @xmath16kpc ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a limit of m@xmath60 m@xmath7 in the same area is consistent with the low - redshift sk relation . the synthesised atca beam at 38ghz probes an area of well over 100 kpc@xmath17 centred on each lbg and",
    "so if there was an underlying larger uv - dark galaxy within which each lbg was embedded , any significant obscured star formation in that galaxy would lead to deviation from the nearby sk relation .",
    "as simulations imply that the relation gets steeper with redshift ( more gas per unit star formation , _",
    "e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the deviation from the sk relation would only increase if the nearby relation is inappropriate .",
    "given the comparatively brief elapsed time between the end of reionization and the redshift explored here , the limited gas reservoirs available for star formation in these systems and their relatively short star formation timescales have an important consequence for the reionization process .",
    "reionization is likely to be dominated by as yet undetected",
    "faint , low mass uv - luminous starbursts ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence of their lower mass , these sources will have even shorter star formation lifetimes than the lbgs observed here . at all redshifts",
    "the recombination time for the igm is longer than the hubble time and hence also much longer than the uv - luminous lifetime of a low mass starburst .",
    "consequently , most of the ionized bubbles expected to exist in the otherwise neutral igm during reionization will only occasionally have uv - luminous sources at their centres , and most starbursts giving rise to the ionising flux will have long - since ceased to actively form stars and therefore have faded in the uv .",
