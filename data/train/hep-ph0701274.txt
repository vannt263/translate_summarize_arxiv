    "the investigation of vector mesons is an actual problem up to now due to their role in forming the electromagnetic structure of particles and because , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the @xmath2-family , only the @xmath5 meson can be deemed to be well understood @xcite .",
    "the other @xmath2-like mesons must be either still confirmed in various experiments and analyses or their parameters essentially corrected .",
    "for example , the @xmath6 meson was discussed actively some time ago @xcite and it was confirmed relatively recently in the amplitude analysis of the lass collaboration @xcite and in combined analysis of several processes @xcite . however this state is referred to only slightly in the pdg issue @xcite ( the relevant observations are listed under the @xmath7 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath1 interaction plays a central role in physics of strongly interacting particles and , therefore , it has always been an object of continuous investigation .",
    "let us note only some recent works devoted also to the theoretical study of the isovector @xmath0-wave of @xmath1 scattering .",
    "first , there are the analyses of available experimental data on the @xmath1 scattering utilizing the roy equations @xcite and the forward dispersion relations @xcite , in which , _ e.g. _ , the low - energy parameters of the @xmath1 scattering were obtained .",
    "second , there are the works in which the low - energy parameters are calculated in chiral theories with the linear realization of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "we have used our model - independent method @xcite based on the first principles ( analyticity and unitarity ) directly applied to analysis of experimental data , aiming at studying the @xmath2-like mesons below 1.9 gev and obtaining the @xmath1-scattering length . unfortunately",
    "this method , using essentially a uniformizing variable , is applicable only in the 2-channel case . here",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath8 channels are allowed for explicitly ( in the threshold range of the latter , one has observed a deviation from elasticity of the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 scattering ) .",
    "influence of other coupled channels is supposed to be taken into account through the background . in order to investigate the coupling of resonances with these other channels ,",
    "we apply also multichannel breit  wigner forms to generate the resonance poles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the method of the uniformizing variable in applying it to studying the 2-channel @xmath1 scattering and present results of the analysis of the available data @xcite@xcite on the isovector @xmath0-wave of @xmath1 scattering .",
    "section iii is devoted to analysis of the same data using the breit ",
    "wigner forms . finally , in section",
    "vi , we summarize and discuss obtained results .",
    "let the @xmath1-scattering @xmath9-matrix be determined on the 4-sheeted riemann surface with the right - hand branch - points at @xmath10 and @xmath11 and also with the left - hand one at @xmath12 .",
    "it is supposed that influence of other branch points can be taken into account through the background .",
    "the riemann - surface sheets are numbered according to the signs of analytic continuations of the channel momenta @xmath13 as follows : @xmath14   correspond to sheets i , ii , iii , iv , respectively .    the @xmath9-matrix is supposed to be  @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents resonances and @xmath17 , the background . in general , an explicit allowance for the @xmath11 branch point would permit us to describe transitions between the @xmath1 and @xmath8 initial and final states with the help of the only one function @xmath18  ( the jost matrix determinant ) using the le couteur  newton relations @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , data on the process @xmath19 are absent .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown how one can obtain the multichannel resonance representations by poles and zeros on the riemann surface with the help of the formulae , expressing analytic continuations of the matrix elements , describing the coupled processes , to unphysical sheets in terms of those on sheet i. it is convenient to start from resonance zeros on sheet i. then in the 2-channel @xmath1 scattering , we have three types of resonances : ( * a * ) described by a pair of complex conjugate zeros in the @xmath9-matrix element on sheet i and by a pair of conjugate shifted zeros on sheet iv ; ( * b * ) described by a pair of conjugate zeros on sheet iii and by a pair of conjugate shifted zeros on sheet iv ; ( * c * ) which correspond to a pair of conjugate zeros on sheet i , a pair on sheet iii and two pairs of conjugate zeros on sheet iv . the poles on sheet ii , iii and iv are situated in the same energy points as the corresponding zeros on sheet i , iv and iii , respectively .",
    "note that the size of shift of zeros on sheet iv relative to the ones on sheets i and iii is determined by the strength of coupling of the channels ( here @xmath1 and @xmath8 ) . the cluster kind is related to the nature of resonance .    with the help of the uniformizing variable scattering amplitude and in ref .",
    "@xcite in the combined analysis of data on processes @xmath20 in the channel with @xmath21 . ] @xmath22 the considered 4-sheeted riemann surface is mapped onto the @xmath23-plane , divided into two parts by the unit circle centered at the origin .",
    "sheets i ( ii ) , iii ( iv ) are mapped onto the exterior ( interior ) of the unit disk on the upper and lower @xmath23-half - plane , respectively .",
    "the physical region extends from the point @xmath24 on the imaginary axis ( @xmath1 threshold ) along the unit circle clockwise in the 1st quadrant to the point 1 on the real axis ( @xmath25 threshold ) and then along the real axis to the point @xmath26 into which @xmath27 is mapped on the @xmath23-plane .",
    "the intervals @xmath28,[-b^{-1},b^{-1}],[b,\\infty)$ ] on the real axis are the images of the corresponding edges of the left - hand cut of the @xmath1-scattering amplitude .",
    "the ( * a * ) resonance is represented in @xmath29 by two pairs of poles on the images of sheets ii and iii , symmetric to each other with respect to the imaginary axis , and by zeros , symmetric to these poles with respect to the unit circle . note that the symmetry of the zeros and poles with respect to the imaginary axis appears due to the real analyticity of the @xmath9-matrix , and the symmetry of the poles and zeros with respect to the unit circle ensures a realization of the known experimental fact that the @xmath1 interaction is practically elastic up to a vicinity of the @xmath25 threshold .",
    "the resonance part of @xmath9-matrix @xmath16 becomes a one - valued function on the @xmath23-plane and , in the @xmath1 channel , it is expressed through the @xmath30-function as follows - wave @xmath1 scattering in the one - channel approach @xcite and in the two - channel one @xcite . in latter work ,",
    "the uniformizing variable @xmath31 has been used and the @xmath1-threshold branch - point has been neglected , therefore , their approach can not be employed near by the @xmath1 threshold . ] : @xmath32 where @xmath30 represents the contribution of resonances , described by one of three types of the pole clusters in the 2-channel case , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the number of pairs of the conjugate zeros",
    ".    the background part @xmath17 is taken in the form : @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the threshold of 4@xmath38 channel noticeable in the @xmath2-like meson decays , @xmath39 is the threshold of @xmath40 channel . due to allowing for the left - hand branch - point at @xmath12 in the uniformizing variable ( [ v ] ) ,",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 is an experimental fact .    with formulas ( [ v : s])([s_bg ] ) ,",
    "we have analyzed data @xcite@xcite for the inelasticity parameter ( @xmath43 ) and phase shift of the @xmath1-scattering amplitude ( @xmath44 ) : @xmath45 .",
    "first , we considered the data of refs .",
    "@xcite introducing three ( @xmath5 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) and four ( the indicated ones plus @xmath48 ) resonances .    from a variety of possible resonance representations by pole - clusters , the analysis selects the following one to be the most relevant : the @xmath5 is described by the cluster of type ( * a * ) and the other resonances by type ( * b * )",
    ". description in both assumed cases is satisfactory : @xmath49 is @xmath50 ( three resonances ) and @xmath51 ( four resonances ) .",
    "the background parameters are : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for the case of three resonances and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for four resonances . when calculating @xmath58 for the inelasticity parameter , three points of data @xcite at 990 , 1506 and 1825 mev have been omitted in both cases as giving the anomalously big contribution to @xmath58 . when calculating @xmath58 for the phase shift , three points of data @xcite at 1841 , 1804 and 1882 mev have been omitted in the case of three resonances and those at 765 , 1643 and 1804 mev in the case of four resonances .",
    "let us show the obtained pole clusters on the lower @xmath59-half - plane in table  [ clusters ] ( it is clear that there are also complex - conjugate poles on the upper half - plane ) .",

    "the dashed curve is for the three - resonance description and the solid one for the four - resonance case .",
    "-.3 cm    though @xmath49 is practically the same in both cases , consideration of the obtained parameters and energy dependence of the fitted quantities suggests that the fourth resonance @xmath75 is desired .",
    "therefore , in the 4-resonance picture , we have also carried out an analysis of data @xcite jointly with the already considered data @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "results of two analyses are cited : one uses the @xmath76-channel helicity amplitude when extracting the @xmath1-scattering amplitude on the @xmath38-exchange pole ; in the other , the @xmath77-channel one is used instead .",
    "therefore , we have taken both analyses as independent .",
    "there are given the data for the phase shift of amplitude below the @xmath78 threshold .",
    "comparing these data with the ones of refs.@xcite , one can see that the points of the former lie systematically by 1@xmath79 - 5@xmath79 higher than the ones of the latter , except for two points of ref.@xcite at 710 and 730  mev , which lie by about 2@xmath79 higher than the corresponding points of ref.@xcite and which are omitted in the subsequent analyses . since we do not know the energy dependence of the remarked deviations of points , we have supposed a constant systematic error that must be determined in the combined analysis of data .",
    "we have obtained a satisfactory description with @xmath80 and with the indicated systematic error equal to @xmath81 .",
    "let us indicate ( table  [ v : zeros ] ) the obtained resonance zero positions on the right - hand @xmath23-half - plane ( there are also zeros symmetric to the indicated ones with respect to the imaginary axis ) .",

    "the reasonable description of all the accessible experimental data on the isovector @xmath0-wave of @xmath1 scattering for the inelasticity parameter ( @xmath43 ) and phase shift of amplitude ( @xmath44 ) @xcite-@xcite have been obtained up to 1.88 gev based on the first principles ( analyticity and unitarity ) directly applied to analysis of the data .",
    "analysis has been carried out in the model - independent approach using the uniformizing variable ( here the satisfactory description is obtained : @xmath82 ) and applying multichannel breit  wigner forms to generate the resonance poles and zeros in the @xmath9-matrix ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the aim of analysis ( except for obtaining a unified formula for the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 scattering amplitude in the whole of investigated energy range ) was to study the @xmath2-like mesons below 1.9 gev and to obtain the @xmath0-wave @xmath1-scattering length .    for the @xmath5 ,",
    "the obtained value of mass is a little bit smaller in the model - independent approach ( @xmath84 mev ) and a little bigger in the breit  wigner ( @xmath85 mev ) one than the averaged one ( @xmath86 mev ) cited in the pdg tables @xcite , however , it also occurs in analysis of some reactions @xcite .",
    "the obtained value of the total width in the first case ( @xmath87 ) coincides with the averaged pdg one ( @xmath88 mev ) and it is a little bit bigger in the second case ( @xmath89 mev ) than the averaged pdg value , however , this is encountered also in other analyses @xcite .",
    "note that predicted widths of the @xmath5 decays to the @xmath90-modes are significantly larger than , _",
    "e.g. _ , the ones evaluated in the chiral model of some mesons based on the hidden local symmetry added with the anomalous terms @xcite .",
    "the second @xmath2-like meson has the mass 1257.8 mev in the 1st analysis and @xmath91 in the 2nd one .",
    "this differs significantly from the mass ( @xmath92 ) of the 2nd @xmath2-like meson cited in the pdg tables @xcite .",
    "we told already in introduction that the @xmath6 meson was discussed actively some time ago @xcite , and next the evidence for it was obtained in some analyses @xcite .",
    "to the point , if this state is interpreted as the first radial excitation of the @xmath93 state , then it lies down well on the corresponding linear trajectory with a universal slope on the @xmath94 @xcite ( n is the radial quantum number of the @xmath95 state ) , while the meson with mass @xmath96 mev turns out to be considerably higher than this trajectory .",
    "the third @xmath2-like meson turns out to have the mass 1580 mev rather than 1720 mev cited in the pdg tables @xcite .",
    "note that in a number of previous analyses of some reactions one has also obtained the resonance with mass near 1580 mev @xcite .",
    "however , some time ago it was shown that the 1600-mev region contains in fact two @xmath2-like mesons .",
    "this was made on the basis of investigation of the consistency of the 2@xmath38 and 4@xmath38 electromagnetic form factors and the @xmath1-scattering length @xcite and as a result of combined analysis of data on the 2@xmath38 and 4@xmath38 final states in the @xmath97 annihilation and photoproduction @xcite .",
    "we assume this possibility , _",
    "i.e. _ , that in the energy range 12001800 mev there are three @xmath2-like mesons , but for the final conclusion the combined analysis of several processes with which the investigated resonances are appreciably coupled have to be performed .",
    "note also a rather big obtained coupling of these @xmath2-like mesons with the 4@xmath38 channels .    finally , as to the @xmath75 , in this energy region there are practically no data on the @xmath0-wave of @xmath1 scattering .",
    "the model - independent analysis , maybe , somehow testifies in favour of existence of this state , whereas the breit ",
    "wigner one gives the same description with and without the @xmath75 .",
    "for more definite conclusion about this state , the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 scattering data above 1.88 gev are needed .",
    "furthermore , the combined analysis of coupled processes should be carried out .",
