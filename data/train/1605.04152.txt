    "normally , in some of the transition metal oxides , jahn - teller ( jt ) effect has been mainly attributed for a structural transition , which take place from high temperature cubic phase to low temperature phases of the compound.@xcite it is important to note that the jt distortion can lead both elongation and compression of octahedra depending on the number of @xmath6 electrons.@xcite here , we discuss only the physics of d@xmath14 and d@xmath15 electron systems .",
    "in d@xmath14 electron systems , two of the threefold degenerate t@xmath7 orbitals are occupied , whereas all three orbitals are occupied for d@xmath15 electron systems .",
    "now , for d@xmath14 electron systems , the degeneracy of t@xmath7 level can be lifted by two ways .",
    "first one by jt mechanism and second one by both jt and spin - orbit mechanisms.@xcite in these systems , tetragonal elongation of the local octahedron with , c / a@xmath41 is more favorable from the viewpoint of jt effect , where both d electrons are occupied by lowest energy degenerate @xmath6@xmath9 and @xmath6@xmath10 orbitals.@xcite in such a situation , the ground state has unfrozen orbital angular momentum .",
    "hence , a further splitting of lowest doublet is expected due to the spin - orbit interaction.@xcite for d@xmath15 electron systems , jt effect is inactive and hence the driving force for structural transition is something of different nature than d@xmath14 electron systems .",
    "spinel compounds , av@xmath0o@xmath1 and acr@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a = zn , mg and cd ) with the face - centered - cubic structure at room temperature are among the most extensively studied geometrically frustrated magnets.@xcite vanadium spinels ( av@xmath0o@xmath1 ) and chromium spinels ( acr@xmath0o@xmath1 ) crystallize in a face - centered cubic structure , where v and cr ions are occupied at the octahedral sites , respectively . in vanadium and chromium spinels ,",

    "hence for vanadates , jt effect is expected to be responsible for a cubic to tetragonal structural transition with c / a@xmath41 , which is contrary to the experimental result.@xcite however , for chromium spinels , jt effect is not expected to play any role in inducing such a transition . structural transition from cubic to tetragonal",
