    "s @xmath10-entropy , the ricci shrinkers play important roles in the singularity analysis of the ricci flow . for example , it is proved by enders - mller - topping  @xcite that the proper rescaling limit of a type - i singularity is always a nontrivial ricci shrinker . more information and references can be found in chapter 30 of the book  @xcite by chow and his coauthors . in dimension 2 , the only ricci shrinkers are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with standard metrics , due to the classification of hamilton  @xcite . in dimension 3 , based on the breakthrough of perelman(@xcite ,  @xcite ) , through the efforts of naber  @xcite , ni - wallach  @xcite and cao - chen - zhu  @xcite , etc , we know that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and their quotients are all the possible ricci shrinkers .    in dimension 4 and higher , much fewer is known about ricci shrinkers . typically , some extra conditions of the curvature operator(e.g .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , etc ) , or geometric properties at infinity(c.f .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ) are required to draw definite geometry conclusion .",
    "we refer the readers the surveys  @xcite ,  @xcite for more detailed picture . without such extra conditions ,",
    "it is still not clear how to classify ricci shrinkers .",
    "however , one can study the moduli of ricci shrinkers . in  @xcite",
    ", cao - sesum showed the weak compactness of the moduli of khler ricci solitons with uniformly bounded diameter and uniformly lower bound of ricci curvature and @xmath10-functional .",
    "the extra conditions were gradually weakened or removed by x. zhang  @xcite , weber  @xcite , chen - wang  @xcite , z.l .",
    "zhang  @xcite and haslhofer - mller  @xcite , etc .    in this article",
    ", we focus on the study of the moduli @xmath17 , which consists of 4d ricci shrinkers which have uniform entropy lower bound and harnack inequality of scalar curvature on unit ball(c.f . definition  [ dfn : mh23_1 ] for precise definition ) .",
    "moreover , we require each ricci shrinker has bounded(not uniformly ) scalar curvature . in light of the results of haslhofer - mller(c.f .",
    "theorem  [ t101 ] ) , it is known that such moduli has weak compactness .",
    "in other words , any sequence of ricci shrinkers in @xmath17 sub - converges to an orbifold ricci shrinker with locally finite singularities , in the pointed - gromov - hausdorff topology .",
    "now we reverse the process and ask the following question :    _ what kind of orbifolds can be approximated by a sequence of ricci shrinkers in @xmath17 ? _    note that flat cones @xmath18 are naturally the simplest orbifold in dimension 4 .",
    "therefore , the first step toward the solution of the above question is to check whether the flat cones can be approximated by ricci shrinkers .",
    "we completely solve this step by the following theorem , which is the main result of this article .",
    "for any @xmath19 and @xmath20 , there exists a small positive number @xmath21 with the following property .",
    ". then we have @xmath23 for every finite subgroup @xmath24 acting freely on @xmath16 .",

    "namely , suppose @xmath26 then we have uniform curvature , injectivity radius estimate inside the unit ball .",
    "such type statement was used in the literature of studying einstein manifolds , e.g. , in cheeger - colding - tian  @xcite and chen - donaldson  @xcite , etc . however , an essential difference here is that we do not allow rescaling of the metric since rescaling will destroy the structure of ( [ e100 ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm:1 ] was motivated by the work of biquard  @xcite , morteza - viaclovsky  @xcite , where they study whether an orbifold can be approximated by einstein metrics , with some extra assumption of the topology of the underlying manifolds .    as applications of theorem  [ thm:1 ]",
    ", we can uniformly estimate the scalar curvature @xmath27 and the ricci potential function @xmath6 .    for any @xmath19 and @xmath20",

    "+ we remark that theorem  [ thm:1 ] should be useful in the study of 4d ricci flow singularities with bounded positive scalar curvature . for every such singularity ,",
    "it seems natural that all the possible singularity model locate in the closure of the moduli @xmath37 , as both requirements in the definition of @xmath37 are satisfied automatically .",
    "+ we briefly discuss the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] and theorem  [ thm:2 ] .",
    "the foundation of theorem  [ thm:1 ] is a rigidity theorem(c.f .",
    "theorem  [ at02 ] ) for singular eigenfunctions of the drifted laplace operator .",
    "suppose @xmath38 is a positive function satisfying @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "we show that @xmath38 must be @xmath41 for some constant @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , @xmath38 is a multiple of the green function poled at the origin .",
    "this rigidity theorem is in the flavor of the classical bcher s decomposition theorem for harmonic functions(c.f .",
    "theorem 3.9 of  @xcite ) . however , the rigidity here is even stronger , due to the ad hoc choice of @xmath40 and the non - zero eigenvalue .",
    "the proof of this rigidity theorem follows the same route as the classical bcher s theorem , by using spherical average .",
    "the complete proof is provided in section 3 .",
    "we reduce the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] to the aforementioned rigidity theorem . if the ricci shrinker @xmath43 is very close to a flat cone @xmath18 , then @xmath27 is close to zero function on a very large annulus part @xmath44 .",
    "we rescale the function @xmath27 by multiplying them with @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the maximum of @xmath27 on the unit sphere @xmath47 .",
    "the rescaled function is denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "note that the underlying metrics are not changed at all .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] is then carried out by a contradiction argument .",
    "suppose theorem  [ thm:1 ] fails , then we can find a sequence @xmath49 converging to some @xmath50 , in the pointed - gromov - hausdorff topology and hence in the pointed-@xmath51-cheeger - gromov topology(c.f",
    ".  theorem  [ t101 ] and the discussion below it ) .",
    "modulo some a priori estimates from elliptic pde , we show that @xmath52 is convergent in proper topology .",
    "moreover , the limit @xmath53 is a solution of ( [ eqn : ca06_1 ] ) on the smooth part of the limit flat cone and hence force can be lifted to the solution of ( [ eqn : ca06_1 ] ) on @xmath54 . using the rigidity of solutions of ( [ eqn : ca06_1 ] )",
    ", we obtain that @xmath55 .",
    "however , it will violate our harnack inequality assumption for the scalar curvature .",
    "therefore , we obtain a desired contradiction to establish the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] .",
    "the technical difficulty of the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] locates in the uniform a priori estimate of @xmath48 .",
    "actually , one has to introduce several extra auxiliary functions(c.f .",
    "definition  [ dfn : mh23_2 ] ) for the purpose of estimating @xmath48 .",
    "all of these auxiliary functions are indicated by the soliton identities arising from ( [ e100 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is a regularity problem of system of elliptic equations and inequalities to obtain such estimates .",
    "these estimates are made possible due to the ad hoc structure of this system and the important progress in the study of 4-d ricci shrinker recently , e.g. , the work of munteanu - wang  @xcite .",
    "one new ingredient for the proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] is to separate the rescaling of the curvature and the rescaling of the metric .",
    "we only need to use the linear structure of the pde satisfied by the curvatures .",
    "therefore , we are able to keep the metric un - rescaled , but rescale the curvatures as functions to obtain desired linear pde solution @xmath53 on the limit space . in the literature of ricci flow study , it seems that the rescaling of metrics and curvatures are always done simultaneously .",
    "we proceed to discuss the proof of theorem  [ thm:2 ] . besides theorem  [ thm:1 ] , a rigidity theorem(c.f .",
    "theorem  [ thm : mh26_2 ] ) of orbifold ricci shrinkers is needed .",
    "this theorem states that every orbifold ricci shrinker with a scalar curvature zero point must be a flat cone .",
    "it can be proved by a standard maximum principle argument .",
    "based on this rigidity theorem and theorem  [ thm:1 ] , our theorem  [ thm:2 ] follows from a contradiction arguments . for example , if part ( a ) of theorem  [ thm:2 ] fails , then we can extract a sequence of ricci shrinkers converging to an orbifold ricci shrinker whose scalar curvature at base point is zero .",
    "consequently , we obtain a sequence of ricci shrinkers converging to a flat cone @xmath18 , which is impossible by theorem  [ thm:1 ] .",
    "this contradiction establishes the proof of part ( a ) .",
    "the remainder part of theorem  [ thm:2 ] can be proved similarly , with extra difficulties which can be solved by delicate application of maximum principles on @xmath27 and @xmath6 .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we review some elementary results of the ricci flow and the ricci shrinkers .",
    "we also introduce important auxiliary functions for the study of ricci shrinkers . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the rigidity theorems related to flat cones .",
    "we classify all positive solutions of ( [ eqn : ca06_1 ] ) which is bounded at infinity .",
    "they are nothing but the constant multiples of green s function on @xmath56 poled at the origin .",
    "moreover , we show that any orbifold ricci shrinker must be flat cone if the scalar curvature equals zero somewhere . in section 4 ,",
    "we develop effective estimates for auxiliary functions on the ricci shrinkers with an almost flat cone annulus .",
    "this section is the technical core of this paper . in section 5 ,",
    "we provide the complete proof of theorem  [ thm:1 ] and theorem  [ thm:2 ] . finally , in section 6 , we list some open questions related to our main theorems .",
