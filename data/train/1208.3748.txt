    "the atlas and cms group of the lhc experiments announced 5 @xmath6 discovery of the higgs boson from the analysis of various channels @xcite . the invariant mass distribution from di - photon and 4 leptons of @xmath7 showed a narrow peak at around 125 @xmath8 126 gev .",
    "the enhanced di - photon event observed in 2011 has been reduced in 2012 .",
    "the number of signal events in the combined di - photon analysis is slightly larger than the standard model prediction though it is compatible within 2 @xmath6 variance . in this paper",
    "we look for the implication of the measured higgs mass and di - photon excess in the higgs search with no discovery of supersymmetric particles .",
    "the higgs boson discovery came earlier than expected while weak scale supersymmetry discovery is delayed .",
    "the usual expectation before the running of the lhc was the opposite that supersymmetric particles were expected to be discovered before the higgs boson if supersymmetry is relevant for the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the current search limit for the gluino and squark is above tev and pushes the supersymmetric models to the corner of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "this tension and the puzzle recently motivated the natural supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the stop , the supersymmetric partner of the top quark can be hidden in the top background if the stop mass is at around 200 gev and the search can be difficult @xcite .",
    "degenerate spectrum can be an alternative due to much weaker bounds from the search as the bound in this case would come from the mono - jet search which is @xmath9 suppressed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in general supersymmetry is pushed to high scale and natural electroweak symmetry breaking from weak scale supersymmetry looks more and more difficult to achieve .",
    "this is also supported by the absence of chargino and neutralino search which is predicted to be light if @xmath5 is small .",
    "we propose a setup in which the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is lower than the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the @xmath5 problem in supersymmetric models @xcite has a nice solution only in gravity mediation @xcite .",
    "it lies in the center of the electroweak symmetry breaking and make the model building with other mediation mechanism quite difficult @xcite .",
    "we consider a model with large @xmath5 without spoiling natural electroweak symmetry breaking . with light cp odd higgs has been studied in @xcite . ]",
    "the higgs appears as a pseudo - goldstone boson of the global symmetry breaking at around a few tev and the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is independent of @xmath5 , more precisely @xmath10 is one loop suppressed compared to @xmath11 , @xmath12 . at the scale of the global symmetry breaking , the higgs potential is absent if the global symmetry was exact at the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the global symmetry is explicitly broken by top yukawa coupling and gauge couplings . as a result there appears a loop correction from the global symmetry breaking scale down to the weak scale .",
    "there are several attempts along this direction with the idea of higgs being a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite and also in the supersymmetric context @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that there are two important aspects which are not discussed in the literature .",
    "firstly , @xmath5 is generated at @xmath0 , the global symmetry breaking scale .",
    "secondly , the presence of new yukawa couplings with extra vector - like fermions can explain the 125 gev higgs boson mass even for @xmath13 at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "double protection of higgs mass with supersymmetry and global symmetry generates a small quartic generated by top loop from @xmath0 to @xmath14 ( the top mass ) and predicts a very light higgs mass which is incompatible with the obseved higgs mass of 125 gev .",
    "we show that this problem can be overcome if there are extra vector - like matters with order one yukawa couplings with the higgs .",
    "if the vector - like fermion is at around a few hundreds gev and sfermion is at tev , the extra vector - like states provide extra loop correction comparable to top loop @xcite and can make the higgs as heavy as 160 gev .",
    "note that ( 160 gev)^2 ~3 m_z^2 = m_z^2 ( tree ) + 2m_z^2(loop ) . therefore , the entire higgs mass m_h^2 = ( 125  gev)^2 ~2 m_z^2 , can come from the loop correction from @xmath15 even if the tree level mass vanishes .",
    "the vector - like fermions with order one yukawa couplings can enhance the higgs to d - photon rate compared to the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , it suffers from vacuum stability if the theory is extrapolated to high energy as order one yukawa couplings make the higgs quartic to be negative at high energy .",
    "the scale of transition can be as low as tev if the yukawa coupling of the vector - like fermions is of order one .",
    "in this paper we show that the rapid running of the higgs quartic coupling driven by yukawa couplings with the vector - like fermions is a virtue in the goldstone boson picture rather than a problem . with the running",
    ", the goldstone higgs boson can be as heavy as 125 gev .    .",
    "+ the black line corresponds to the running of the standard model higgs quartic .",
    "the change of the slope is mainly due to the running of the top yukawa coupling which becomes small at high energy .",
    "the blue line shows the running of @xmath16 starting at around 10 tev down to @xmath17 by top quark yukawa for @xmath18 and no finite threshold correction from the stop .",
    "the higgs mass is @xmath19 in this case . in the presence of the stop threshold correction ( vertical line at around 1 tev ) ,",
    "the higgs mass @xmath19 is obtained with stop mass 1 tev for @xmath13 ( half from finite threshold correction and the other half from logarithmic running of top quark ) .",
    "the orange line shows the rapid running of @xmath16 in the presence of vector - like fermions without top / stop contributions . starting from vanishing quartic ( @xmath20 ) at tev ,",
    "@xmath21 is obtained with the help of top / stop and vector - like matters which is shown in red line.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    goldstone boson picture predicts too light higgs mass from top loop alone .",
    "vector - like fermions needed to explain the di - photon enhancement make the higgs potential unstable at high energy .",
    "these two problems are cured if the goldstone boson explanation comes with the extra vector - like fermions .",
    "higgs mass can be as large as 125 gev with the aid of the vector - like fermion yukawa couplings .",
    "the stability problem was due to the simple extrapolation of the low energy theory up to high energy .",
    "the higgs quartic is zero at @xmath0 and new degrees of freedom appear from the scale @xmath0 .",
    "the simple extrapolation to higher energy is failed . indeed",
    "the potential is flat if the global symmetry is restored .",
    "the theory is linked to the supersymmetric theory in which the potential is bounded from below .",
    "goldstone picture and the vector - like fermions are the perfect combination which make the setup phenomenologically viable .",
    "this setup provides an interesting example in which the natural electroweak symmetry breaking is not directly related to @xmath5 but is smaller by a loop factor .",
    "no discovery of light chargino and neutralino would be understood in this setup .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we explain the basic idea of generating large @xmath5 and also having higgs as a pseudo - goldstone boson in supersymmetry .",
    "second , we introduce the models with vector - like supermultiplets .",
    "third , we consider a loop correction to the higgs potential with vector - like matters .",
    "fourth , we compute the higgs to di - photon event rate and compare it with the recent lhc data . finally , we conclude that the pseudo - goldstone higgs is a viable option in supersymmetry if extra vector - like matters are present and the stability issue turns out to be a merit to provide the measured higgs mass .",
    "in this paper we do not discuss how the global symmetry is realized at a few tev from uv theory with higher cutoff and leave it as a separate topic of future work .",
    "also we do not discuss the vacuum alignment problem . here",
    "the global symmetry breaking occurs along the direction orthogonal to the electroweak symmetry and the electroweak symmetry breaking appears from the dynamics of the goldstone boson .",
    "when the global symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of the singlet , a goldstone boson appears . if the @xmath5 term is generated in connection with the global symmetry breaking , we can separate the electroweak symmetry breaking from the @xmath5 parameter which is tied to the global symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking occurs from the loop correction of the pseudo - goldstone boson potential . as a result",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking scale can be naturally low compared to the @xmath22 without causing severe fine tuning of the parameters .",
    "there are various versions of models in which the higgs boson appears as a goldstone boson in supersymmetry . in most cases",
    "the generation of @xmath5 is not discussed in detail in the model construction .",
    "if @xmath5 is very small compared to other soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , this can be accepted as a good approximation . however",
    ", many model buildings suffer from the generation of the right size @xmath5 and also @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "indeed giudice - masiero mechanism in gravity mediation is the only natural solution and all of the other mediation models suffer from @xmath23 problems .",
    "therefore , it would be appropriate to discuss the generation of @xmath5 from the beginning",
    ".    the mechanism of goldstone boson higgs in supersymmetry with @xmath5 generation can be general and can be realized in many different concrete models but in this paper we take a simple specific example to illustrate how it works .",

    "in this section , we present a phenomenological model which is relevant for lhc measurement of higgs and electroweak precision measurements . as we have discussed in the previous section , we would not provide a complete model for global symmetry breaking but a phenomenological model of psedudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) higgs with vector - like matter superfields .    in the context of extended mssm ,",
    "implications of vector - like matter have been discussed in literatures @xcite . without introducing additional gauge symmetry , we would consider sm - like vector - like superfields that can couple to sm higgs and sm superfields .",

    "from the recent measurement of higgs decay @xcite , we have seen some substantial excess in diphoton channel but not in other channels though the error bar is large at this stage . if we anticipate that the diphoton excess compared to the standard model prediction survives even after the error bar is reduced , it means that higgs to di - photon coupling ( @xmath81 ) is enhanced by some new physics effects but higgs to gluon coupling ( @xmath82 ) is not . for such reason , we do not consider the vector - like particles with color since they also modify @xmath82 coupling . by decoupling colored vector - like particles",

    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) running from the scale of global symmetry breaking to weak scale , quadratic and quartic potential of higgs are developed as we discussed in the previous section . in the following section ,",

    "it is enough to introduce charge particle yukawa couplings , @xmath94 and @xmath95 and the large yukawa coupling can contribute higgs quartic coupling for 125 gev higgs mass .",
    "then , we might decouple neutral particle by putting @xmath24 very high or @xmath96 and @xmath97 very small . in such case",
    ", however , isospin symmetry is maximally broken and large yukawa coupling @xmath98 and @xmath99 that are required to make higgs mass 125 gev substantially contribute oblique parameters @xmath42 and @xmath100 . if ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath24 ) are similar to ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath101 ) , i.e. , neutral sector are similar to charged sector , then isospin symmetry is approximately preserved so @xmath100 is highly suppressed .",
    "we will discuss this issue later .",
    "in addition to oblique corrections , including neutral particles has another advantage .",
    "higgs mass can be generated partly by stop loop and partly by vector - like matter loop . under the assumption that soft mass scale of vector - like particles is not much higher than tev scale , it is somewhat difficult for loop correction of vector - like scalar to be as large as stop loop correction since leptonic particles do not have color factor 3 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we introduce neutral vector - like particles which have similar yukawa coupling as charged particles , they take part of sizable corrections for higgs mass , i.e. , it makes the effect of 2 copies of lepton pair .",
    "this will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "in calculating higgs mass correction in the mssm , it was found that one loop correction is positive and two loop correction is negative .",
    "although two loop correction is smaller than one loop , it requires much heavier stop much than one loop case since the slope in the higgs - stop mass plot is very mild at 125 gev higgs mass .",
    "however if one includes three loop correction , then it is not very different from one loop result @xcite .    as the three loop result is more close to the one loop result rather than two loop computation , we calculate higgs mass correction from extra vector - like matters only in one loop accuracy .",
    "we use one loop effective potential method .",

    "let us begin with the familiar top / stop contribution to the higgs mass in the mssm .",

    ", our feynhiggs result can not be so accurate because extra vector - like states can modify it through 2-loop beta function .",
