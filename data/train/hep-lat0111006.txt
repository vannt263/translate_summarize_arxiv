    "the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath3 is parameterized by the @xmath4 parameter . in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we have computed @xmath0 from the average plaquette and the scale parameter @xmath5 . an essential step in our calculation was the conversion of the boosted coupling @xmath6 to the renormalized coupling @xmath7 .",
    "this was done in two - loop tadpole improved perturbation theory , which resulted in an ( estimated ) systematic uncertainty of the order of the statistical error .",
    "we can do better now . in this talk",
    "we shall apply pad techniques to approximate an unknown three - loop coefficient in the conversion formula .",
    "this reduces the systematic uncertainty to an insignificant amount , as we shall see .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 proceeds in three steps :    first we compute the average plaquette @xmath8 from which we obtain @xmath6 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bare lattice coupling .",
    "note that the non - perturbative contribution to the plaquette , i.e. the difference between the lattice number and the perturbative series , is less than @xmath11  @xcite .    in the second step",
    "we compute @xmath7 from @xmath6 .",
    "this is the main task . to three loops we obtain , following the notation of  @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "we know all coefficients except for @xmath14 .",
    "( see @xcite for references . )",
    "the latter can be computed from the difference of the four - loop coefficients , @xmath15 , of the @xmath16 function @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the scheme .",
    "we find @xmath19 we know @xmath20 , but we do not know @xmath21 . in the @xmath2 scheme",
    "the four - loop @xmath16 function turns out to be very well reproduced by the pad - improved three - loop @xmath16 function @xmath22}^{\\mathcal s}(g_{\\mathcal s } ) = -g_{\\mathcal s}^3 \\frac{b_0b_1+(b_1 ^ 2-b_0b_2^{\\mathcal s})g_{\\mathcal s}^2}{b_1-b_2^{\\mathcal s } g_{\\mathcal s}^2}. \\label{pade}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "1 we compare ( [ pade ] ) with the four - loop expression .",
    "we see that in the region @xmath23 , which is the region relevant to our calculation , the pad - improved three - loop result differs by less than @xmath24 from the four - loop result .",
    "we expect that the same is true for the boosted @xmath16 function @xmath25 , which converges at a similar rate as @xmath26 .",
    "thus we may approximate @xmath25 by @xmath27}^\\square$ ] .",
    "expanding ( [ pade ] ) gives us then @xmath28 we can improve the convergence of the series ( [ boxcon ] ) further by re - expressing it in terms of the tadpole improved coefficients @xmath29 this amounts , for example , to replacing every @xmath30 by @xmath31 we have already seen in  @xcite that tadpole improvement reduces the coefficients of the two - loop fermionic contribution .",
    "we find that tadpole improvement is equally successful in reducing the coefficients of the three - loop contributions .",
    "in the final step we compute @xmath0 from @xmath32 using the renormalization group equation @xmath33 for @xmath26 we use the pad - improved four - loop @xmath16 function @xmath34}^{\\overline{ms}}\\,(g_{\\overline{ms}})&= & - g^3_{\\overline{ms } } \\big(b_0\\,(b_1 ^ 2-b_0b_2^{\\overline{ms}})+(b_1 ^ 3 \\nonumber\\\\ & - & 2b_0b_1b_2^{\\overline{ms } } + b_0 ^ 2\\,b_3^{\\overline{ms}})\\,g^2_{\\overline{ms}}\\big)\\big/ \\big(b_1 ^ 2 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & b_0b_2^{\\overline{ms } } + ( b_0b_3^{\\overline{ms } } - b_1b_2)\\,g^2_{\\overline{ms } } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( b_2^{\\overline{ms}\\ , 2 } -b_1b_3^{\\overline{ms}})\\ , g^4_{\\overline{ms}}\\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a better approximation than the four - loop @xmath16 function .",
    "the result should be independent of @xmath35 if our approximations of @xmath26 in ( [ boxcon ] ) and ( [ conv ] ) are consistent .",
    "we have varied @xmath35 between 4 and 10 gev and found indeed that @xmath0 changes by a fraction of a percent only .",
    "finally we have chosen @xmath36 , which corresponds to @xmath37 gev .",
    "we may estimate the error arising from our approximation ( [ b3 ] ) by replacing @xmath20 by @xmath38 as well .",
    "we found that this changes our results by at most @xmath39 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to convert our numbers to a physical scale we have used the force parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "the numbers have increased by @xmath40 relative to our previous values  @xcite , which is well inside the systematic error that was estimated in that paper .",
    "we fit our data by    @xmath41    ( for details of the fit see @xcite . ) in fig .",
    "2 we show @xmath42 and @xmath43 which , if the fit is successful , should collapse the data points onto a single line each .",
    "we see that this is indeed the case .",
    "we also see that the largest uncertainty arises from the continuum extrapolation , while the data depend only weakly on the quark mass . in the chiral and continuum",
    "limit our fit gives @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "using @xmath46  fm , we finally obtain @xmath47 this is to be compared with our previous result @xmath48 .",
    "our calculation faces two problems .",
    "one is the conversion from the boosted to the @xmath2 scheme . the other is the extrapolation to the chiral and continuum limit .",
    "we have solved the first problem , and with time and more data we hope to improve on the extrapolation ."
