    "pursuit of higher angular resolution is fundamental to the development of modern observational astronomy because higher angular resolution provides better knowledge of detailed structure of astronomical objects . at any wavelength of electromagnetic wave , angular resolution ( or often referred to as ",
    "beam size  in radio astronomy , and  diffraction limit  in optical astronomy ) is simply given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the angular resolution , @xmath4 is the observing wavelength , and @xmath5 is the diameter of the telescope . for a given wavelength of @xmath4 , it is essential to have a larger telescope to obtain higher angular resolution .",
    "however , building a large telescope is highly demanding in terms of technology as well as cost , and practically there is a severe limit of the size of a single - dish telescope .",
    "interferometer is an alternative approach to obtain high angular resolution by synthesizing a large telescope that can not be realized as a stand - alone single telescope . through the whole electromagnetic spectral window ,",
    "radio interferometer is most successful for synthesizing a huge telescope and consequently a sharp beam ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , vlbi ( very long baseline interferometer ) , which utilizes intercontinental baselines or sometimes even space baselines , provides the highest angular resolution ever obtained in the history of astronomy . vlbi with earth - size baselines at cm wavelength readily provides an angular resolution as small as 0.1 mas .",
    "however , astronomical objects still have structures smaller than the angular resolution available with vlbi , and there is definitely need of higher angular resolution .",
    "unfortunately , the maximum baseline of vlbi array is basically limited by the earth size , except in case of space vlbi projects such as vsop / halca @xcite and radioastron @xcite .",
    "once the array size is reached at the maximum , the only way left for improving resolution is to go to shorter wavelength .    in order to achieve higher angular resolution ,",
    "a lot of efforts have been made to build an international mm / sub - mm vlbi array ( e.g. , eht : event horizon telescope , see e.g. , doeleman et al .",
    "one of the major goals of high - angular resolution observations with eht is to resolve event horizon scale of nearby super - massive black holes such as sgr a * and m87 . for doing this ,",
    "a resolution of 10 @xmath6as scale is required . however , going to a short wavelength ( or a high frequency ) is a big challenge , and the angular resolution can not be improved infinitely by shortening the wavelength .",
    "for instance , practical limit for sub - mm vlbi is thought to be @xmath70.8 mm ( or 350 ghz ) , considering available sites and stations on the earth .",
    "vlbi with a 0.8 mm wavelength and a 9000 km baseline would provide an angular resolution of @xmath8 20 @xmath6as",
    ". however , this resolution may not be enough to resolve the black hole structure in the vicinity of event horizon depending on black hole size , and there would be a further need of improvement of angular resolution .",
    "super - resolution , which provides a higher resolution than the standard diffraction limit of @xmath9 , is an alternative and attractive approach to break the limit of angular resolution imposed by the earth size and the maximum observing frequency .",
    "super - resolution is equivalent to expanding array size and/or going to higher frequency , and thus it will provide a significant impact on high - resolution astronomy such as black hole imaging and other fields in astronomy as well .",
    "vlbi , for which we would like to discuss the possibility of super - resolution imaging , is a type of radio interferometer that is in principle the same to connected arrays . the raw output of a radio interferometer is cross - power spectrum , which is also referred to as visibility @xmath10 as a function of spatial frequency ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "the spatial frequency corresponds to projected baseline normalized with the observing wavelength ( i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are physical lengths of the projected baseline ) .",
    "as is widely known , interferometric images of astronomical sources @xmath15 can be obtained by two - dimensional fourier transform of observed visibilities @xmath10 as , @xmath16 by definition of fourier transform , the integration for @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be conducted over infinite range ( i.e. , from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , practically this is impossible : first , the array size is finite and there should be a limit of baseline length , beyond which no visibility can be sampled .",
    "secondly , there must be space between antennas , which causes unsampled  holes in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "such an incomplete ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) coverage always causes  underdetermined problem  in the radio interferometer equation such as equation ( [ eq:2d - ft ] ) .",
    "usually this problem is solved by filling unsampled visibilities with zero , which is referred to as  zero - padding  in the present paper .",
    "it is this process that causes a finite beam size in the resultant images and hence limits the image resolution .",
    "we note that in classical fourier transformation , all unmeasured visibilities are implicitly set to zero , and we refer to this loosely as the  zero - padding  problem , while normally the term is used to describe the insertion of a block of zeroes to match the grid size to 2@xmath20 and/or to interpolate the spectrum .    on the other hand , there are different approaches to reconstruct radio interferometer images such as maximum entropy method ( mem ) and/or model fitting , which are different from the standard imaging synthesis described above in the sense that these methods do not utilize fourier transformation with zero - padding but instead select the model which describes observed visibilities best using other criteria ( as the problem is underdetermined and has infinite number of solutions ) . as seen later in this paper , such an approach to select the best solution can provide a resolution higher than the standard imaging provided an appropriate selection is done .",
    "in fact , there have been several discussions on possibility of super - resolution by mem and model fitting to visibilities ( e.g. , cornwell & evans 1985 ) .",
    "meanwhile , sparse modeling is recognized as a new and powerful approach to solve an underdetermined problem by introducing sparsity of the solution .",
    "recent developments of compressive sensing ( donoho 2006 , candes & tao 2006 ) and lasso ( least absolute shrinkage and selection operator , tibshirani 1996 ) provide mathematical tools of sparse modeling , which may be applied to radio interferometry imaging .",
    "in fact , pioneering works such as @xcite and @xcite discussed application of compressive sensing and demonstrated its power in radio interferometer imaging based on comparisons with standard clean images . in this paper , in order to evaluate the impact of sparse modeling technique on super - resolution imaging , we apply lasso to simulated data and discuss its application to imaging of black hole shadows .",
    "( 130mm,130mm)figure1-v2.eps    here we start our discussion on super - resolution by reviewing how the synthesized beam is generated by limited @xmath21 coverage . to clearly illustrate the effect of finite @xmath21 coverage on the beam size ( and how this effect can be avoided to obtain super - resolution image ) , here we consider a simple one - dimensional problem , where visibility @xmath22 and intensity @xmath23 is related with each other through one - dimensional fourier transform : @xmath24 suppose that there is a point source at @xmath25 , which is described as @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is dirac s delta function ) , and also suppose that visibility @xmath22 is uniformly sampled for spatial frequency @xmath0 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "figures 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the case for @xmath30 : in figure 1(a ) , the true visibility for the point source is @xmath31 for any @xmath0 , but actual sampling is done only between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for spatial frequency at @xmath34 , there is no observation and hence no information is available on the source visibility .",
    "on the other hand , figure 1(b ) shows the fourier transform of the true visibility ( @xmath31 for any @xmath0 ) and the observed visibility ( @xmath31 only for @xmath35 and 0 for other range of @xmath0 ) .",
    "as is widely known , the latter case generates an extended beam in the form of @xmath36 function , with infinite number of side - lobes as seen in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the size of the main beam is @xmath37 , which is consistent with equation ( [ eq : beamsize ] ) .",
    "this is the standard approach to obtain an image in radio interferometry synthesis , and this example clearly illustrates the effect on the beam size of finite sampling ( i.e. , only for @xmath38 ) .    in practical imaging synthesis , side - lobe levels can be reduced by using taper function instead of equal weight to all the sampled data .",
    "for instance , by introducing a gaussian taper function , side - lobe level can be reduced significantly .",
    "however , while taper is useful for handling side - lobe problems , it is of no use for improving the main beam size .",
    "in fact , introducing a gaussian taper function ( and other typical tapers that have lower weight on longer baselines ) increases the main beam size and thus degrades angular resolution of the synthesized image .",
    "this example clearly shows how the standard fourier transform approach ( with zero - padding ) limits the size of synthesized beam and the angular resolution of image .      in order to obtain super - resolution image ,",
    "here we consider a different approach than standard fourier transform of observed visibilities .",
    "in particular , to avoid zero - padding , we regard observational equations as underdetermined , which have a series of solutions that are consistent with observed visibilities",
    ". figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) show examples of such a series of solutions . here",
    "we again assume that the visibility of a point source at @xmath25 is sampled only for @xmath35 , namely @xmath39 in figure 1(c ) we show several possible visibility functions that are consistent with observed visibilities in equation ( [ eq:1d - visib - point ] ) : @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "all the four visibility functions are consistent with the observations , @xmath45 for @xmath41 . in other words",
    ", one can not distinguish these different functions from the current observations . in figure 1(d ) we show the fourier transformation of these four visibility functions .",
    "as is expected , these different visibility functions result in @xmath46-function with different beam - size : when the maximum @xmath0 becomes larger , the beam becomes sharper .",
    "here we emphasize that all the four solutions are fully consistent with observed visibilities ( equation [ [ eq:1d - visib - point ] ] ) , but in the image domain , they provide totally different angular resolution .",
    "therefore , limited sample of visibilities such as equation ( [ eq:1d - visib - point ] ) does not necessarily exclude the solutions with angular resolution finer than the standard beam size .",
    "however , there exist a infinite number of solutions which satisfy observations , and it is not possible to select a unique solution solely based on the observed visibilities .",
    "therefore , to obtain the most - optimized solution , one needs to introduce additional constraint to select the best one among a series of possible solutions .",
    "now the simple question is : how can we select the best solution amongst infinite number of possible solutions ?",
    "this selection can be done by imposing an additional constraint other than the observations described in equation ( [ eq:1d - visib - point ] ) .",
    "in fact , in practical synthesis , additional constraint on images are quite often introduced .",
    "for instance , it is often assumed that the intensity distribution @xmath23 ( or @xmath15 in the two - dimensional case ) is non - negative , except for imaging of absorption features .",
    "also , in practical radio interferometry synthesis , image is obtained for a limited area in the sky plane , in which it is implicitly assumed that the source intensity is distributed within the image size considered . in most cases",
    "these assumptions are fairly reasonable and often used to obtain the synthesis images based on the standard fourier transformation .    while these assumptions appear somewhat trivial for the standard imaging , these additional constraints are of great help for selecting the best solution in the approach considered in the current section .",
    "for instance , in the case for figures 1(c ) and 1(d ) , while there are infinite number of @xmath46-function solutions of @xmath23 which are consistent with observations ( @xmath31 for @xmath35 ) , an additional constraint on positivity of @xmath23 automatically select @xmath26 as the best solution . in this case , the resultant image is a point source which perfectly matches with the initial image , recovering a super - resolution image with infinite angular resolution !",
    "also , if one adopts a constraint on the emitting region , the best image should be again the point source solution , which has the lowest side - lobe level and hence provide minimum power outside the area considered for imaging .",
    "another possible way to provide an additional constraint is to assume  sparsity  of the image .",
    "if one prefers an image with the smallest number of non - zero grids , again the point source solution becomes the best image amongst infinite number of @xmath46-function solutions .",
    "all the three examples above demonstrate that selecting the best solution with additional constraint from possible solutions can , at least in some occasions , provide a super - resolution image which represents the true image better than that obtained by the standard fourier transform approach .",
    "of course , there is no guarantee if such an approach always works well .",
    "however , one can safely say that while the deterministic approach with the standard fourier transformation ( with zero - padding ) always suffers from the finite size of the synthesized beam , there is a possibility to obtain super - resolution images by selecting the best solution in an underdetermined problem .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , image reconstruction from interferometry data ( visibilities ) usually becomes an ill - posed problem .",
    "the zero - padding technique causes a serious degradation of the image with finite beam size as well as multiple side - lobes . on the other hand ,",
    "if zero - padding is not done , basically the interferometric equation becomes an underdetermined problem for which an infinite number of solutions exist .",
    "as shown in the last section , a proper selection of the best solution from possible ones may lead us to super - resolution image .",
    "however , generally speaking the selection is not unique and it is hard to tell which one would be the best .    sparse modeling is a class of techniques to solve such an underdetermined problem effectively .",
    "basic idea of sparse modeling is to choose the meaningful sparse solution of underdetermined problem by introducing additional constraint on sparsity : if most components of the solution vector are 0 ( which is referred to as a  sparse solution ) , such an underdetermined problem can provide a unique solution . since this approach favors sparse solution , one can expect that its application to interferometer imaging would lead to super - resolution image , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "recently  compressive sensing  is a very hot topic in the field of sparse modeling , and is recognized as a powerful tool to solve such an underdetermined problem .",
    "suppose that there is a set of linear equations expressed as @xmath47 where we assume that the dimension of the observable vector @xmath48 ( which corresponds to visibility in radio interferometer ) is smaller than the dimension of the solution vector @xmath49 ( image ) . in this case , the above equation becomes an underdetermined problem and",
    "basically there is no unique solution . however , if most components of the solution vector @xmath49 are 0 ( i.e. , if the solution is sparse ) , then actual dimension of observations could exceed the effective dimension of the solution , and a unique solution will be obtained even though the apparent dimension of @xmath49 is larger than that of @xmath48 .",
    "this is the basic idea of compressive sensing .    for obtaining such a sparse solution ,",
    "the most direct way is to minimize the number of non - zero components of the solution vector .",
    "generally , @xmath50-norm @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 @xmath53 note that the @xmath54-norm @xmath55 describes the number of non - zero components of @xmath49 . with the use of the @xmath54-norm , obtaining a sparse solution from an underdetermined problem",
    "can be regarded as finding a solution with minimum @xmath54-norm , which can be described as @xmath56 technically this problem can be solved by trying all possible combinations of 0 components of @xmath49 one by one .",
    "unfortunately , however , this is computationally very costly , and there is no practical algorithm for solving such a problem for a large dimension .    on the other hand , under some circumstances , it is known that sparse solution obtained by relaxing @xmath54-norm to @xmath57-norm can provide exact solutions for such a problem , i.e. , @xmath58 the condition under which the solution of equation ( [ eq : sparsemodeling - l1 ] ) becomes identical to that of equation ( [ eq : sparsemodeling - l0 ] ) is revealed by donoho ( 2006 ) , and candes and tao ( 2006 ) . such a framework for solving underdetermined problems",
    "is quite often referred to as  compressive sensing  ( or sometimes  compressed sensing  ) .",
    "in fact , this has been recognized as a very effective framework to solve underdetermined problems which could not be solved in a standard manner .",
    "applications of compressive sensing to radio interferometry are recently discussed by wiaux et al.(2009 ) , wenger et al.(2010 ) , li et al.(2011 ) , and so on .",
    "compressive sensing and sparse modeling will be used in a wider field of astronomy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as seen in its rapid growth in other fields of imaging science such as mri ( @xcite ) .",
    "lasso ( least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ) is another widely - used technique in sparse modeling , originally developed in the field of statistics ( tibshirani 1996 ) .",
    "as is the case for compressive sensing , lasso also utilizes @xmath57 norm , but the solution @xmath49 is obtained as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a regularization parameter .",
    "the first term in the argument of the right - hand side describes goodness of fit , which is commonly used in least - squares fitting , and the second term is the penalty term based on the @xmath57-norm .",
    "the regularization parameter @xmath60 adjusts degree of sparsity by changing the weight of the @xmath57-norm penalty .",
    "the underlying idea of compressive sensing and lasso is quite similar : for any underdetermined problem , there are infinite number of solutions which satisfy the conditions such as @xmath61 or @xmath62 . the key issue is how to select the most realistic solution ( which best represents the truth ) , and both compressive sensing and lasso do this by selecting sparse solution which has many zero components in @xmath49 .",
    "the difference between the two is that in compressive sensing the selection is simply done only by @xmath57-norm and thus selection is rather automatic , but in lasso one can adjust the sparsity of the solution by varying the regularization parameter @xmath60 .",
    "for instance , a large @xmath60 prefers a solution with very few non - zero components , while @xmath63 introduces no sparsity ( in which case one can not choose any specific solution from infinite number of the possible solutions ) .",
    "generally optimization of @xmath60 in lasso is an important issue .",
    "some statistical methods , such as information criteria or cross validation , can be used for this optimization .",
    "another idea is to adjust @xmath60 based on the estimate of the sparsity , which might be obtained from some a priori information or theoretical predictions .",
    "optimized value of @xmath60 is dependent of characteristics of problems to be solved ( i.e. , the shapes of observation matrix @xmath64 and also image @xmath49 ) , and the detailed discussion on this issue is to be given in a future work . in this paper",
    ", we basically use @xmath60 which is an order of unity , but in section 5 we also discuss the effect of @xmath60 in the resultant images of black hole shadow .",
    "we also point out that when applying compressive sensing or lasso , it is important that the phenomena which we are dealing with indeed have sparse solution .",
    "otherwise , introduction of sparsity becomes unrealistic , and thus the sparse solution obtained by compressive sensing or lasso is of no use .",
    "however , as we discussed later , in the case of vlbi imaging , where only brightest part of the emission is observable due to the filtering effect of interferometer ( i.e. , extended emissions are resolved out ) , we can expect sparsity in vlbi images , and thus one can expect that such an approach could work , in particular for imaging black hole shadow .      in this paper we formulate the interferometric imaging problem with lasso as follows , @xmath65 where the inequality applies componentwise . here",
    "we add a positivity condition for @xmath49 because our major interest is to image emission rather than absorption .",
    "note that in the current paper @xmath49 in equation ( [ eq : lasso2 ] ) corresponds to an image vector .",
    "for two dimensional cases , its dimension is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of grids along @xmath68 and @xmath69 axes of images .",
    "also , @xmath48 corresponds to the observed visibility vector @xmath10 , and the observation matrix @xmath64 consists of the exponential components in the fourier transformation , i.e. , @xmath70 .    in sparse modeling",
    ", an important question is in which domain the solution becomes sparse .",
    "if the real solution is not sparse in the domain under consideration , applying sparse modeling ( compressive sensing or lasso ) could lead to unreasonable solutions which do not represent the real solution . in the present study , we simply assume that the solution becomes sparse in the image domain , because we focus on observations of super - massive black holes with mm and sub - mm vlbi .",
    "we note that the emissions observed with mm and sub - mm vlbi are compact because vlbi arrays intrinsically work as a  filter to extract compact high - brightness components ( extended emissions are resolved out ) .",
    "such compact emissions are expected to be mostly associated to the vicinity of black holes and thus confined to a part of an image area , making the expected image sparse in the image domain itself .",
    "we solve the problem described in equation ( [ eq : lasso2 ] ) by rewriting this as a quadratic programming ( qp ) problem and use qp solver .",
    "the standard form of qp is @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the transpose , @xmath73 is a column vector , and @xmath74 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "it is easy to rewrite equation ( [ eq : lasso2 ] ) as equation ( [ eq : qp ] ) . in our numerical simulations , we used matlab qp solver to solve the one - dimensional problem . for one - dimensional problem , we used a naive iterative - shrinkage - thresholding ( ist ) algorithm ( daubechies , defrise & de mol 2004 ) . note that essentially both methods give identical results .",
    "in order to see how super - resolution image can be achieved by the technique of sparse modeling , first we consider the simplest example , namely a problem to identify two adjacent point sources in one - dimensional space .",
    "we note that in such a case visibility @xmath22 and image @xmath23 are related to each other through equation ( [ eq:1d - ft ] ) . here",
    "we assume two point sources within the standard synthesized beam , with the main component at the origin , and the secondary component at @xmath75 .",
    "we set intensity of the main component to be unity and that of the secondary to be 0.8 ( the intensity difference is introduced to test if the amplitudes of the two components are retrieved well ) . in mathematical expression , we may write as @xmath76 we also assume one dimensional observation which uniformly samples the @xmath0-plane for @xmath41 .",
    "this setting corresponds to a synthesized beam size of unity in the image domain , and we try to resolve two point sources with @xmath77 using sparse modeling . here",
    "the solution @xmath23 is obtained from the sampled visibilities @xmath22 by using the lasso algorithm shown in equation ( [ eq : lasso2 ] ) .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of the simulation results for @xmath78 .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , the two point sources within the standard beam size ( which has a full width of @xmath79 in @xmath80 ) are clearly separated in the image obtained with lasso .",
    "this simple simulation clearly illustrates that structure within the beam size can be resolved by the sparse modeling technique ( but note that noise is absent in this simulation .",
    "the effect of the noise will be discussed later in section 4.3 ) .",
    "the dashed lines in figures 2 denote the initial positions of the main and secondary point sources , showing that the position of the secondary peak is accurately retrieved .",
    "also , the intensity radio of the two sources is reproduced well .",
    "the results shown here clearly demonstrate that obtaining images with sparse modeling can indeed retrieve information on structure smaller than the synthesized beam size , as is discussed in the previous section .",
    "for a larger value of @xmath81 , the sparse modeling also works well just as the case shown in figure 2 . on the other hand , for @xmath81 smaller than @xmath82 , the solution becomes a single component located between the two point sources in the initial image , indicating that there is a critical separation below which separating the two adjacent points becomes difficult .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)figure3-v2.eps    as we have seen above , sparse modeling can provide information in a scale finer than the synthesized beam size . on the other hand , there is a separation limit in resolving the two points , and hence super - resolution image should also have a finite beam size .",
    "then , here comes the next question : what is the optimal size of the restoring beam for such super - resolution images ? to evaluate this , here we used the simulation in the previous section , and compared the true ( initial ) image and reconstructed image with varying the restoring beam size .",
    "suppose that the initial image is @xmath83 and the solution by sparse - modeling is @xmath84 . by introducing a gaussian restoring beam function @xmath85 where @xmath86 , the restoring - beam - convolved initial image is given by @xmath87 and the super - resolution image is given by @xmath88 here @xmath89 is fwhm of the restoring beam size for super - resolution image . with these , one can define image residual , which measures the goodness of the resultant super - resolution image , as @xmath90    figure 3 shows @xmath91 as a function of the separation of the two point sources in the initial image ( @xmath81 ) , with nine different values of restoring beam size , @xmath89 = @xmath92 , @xmath93 , ... , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the standard beam size , which is equal to unity here ) . as seen in figure 3 , the largest difference between the initial image and super - resolution occurs around @xmath96 , where the identification of the two components becomes difficult .",
    "however , even for the worst case with @xmath96 , the image residual @xmath91 remains within 10% for a restoring beam size of @xmath94 ( or super - resolution factor of 10 ) .",
    "if one requires the maximum image residual at @xmath83% level or less , then the super - resolution factor of 5 is still acceptable .",
    "therefore , these simulation results indicate that based on the sparse modeling technique super - resolution image by a factor of a few or slightly more is achievable within reasonably small errors .",
    "( 170mm,100mm)figure4-v2.eps    here we consider the effect of noise , which was not considered in the above discussion .",
    "we solve the same problem shown in figure [ fig : two - points ] with the source separation of @xmath78 , but this time we added gaussian noises to the visibilities , and the image reconstruction is done in the same manner using lasso .",
    "figures [ fig : one - dim - with - noise ] show the results for the three cases with different noise amplitude , with gaussian noise level @xmath97 to be 5% , 15% , and 25% of the peak visibility amplitude . for the gaussian convolution ,",
    "again we used the one - tenth of the standard beam size .    for the case with the 5% noise level ,",
    "the image reconstruction is nearly perfect : basically the two peaks are recovered correctly in terms of both the positions ( @xmath25 and @xmath98 ) and the peak flux ( 1 and 0.8 ) .",
    "this result ensures that as far as the noise is sufficiently small , the addition of the noise does not alter that the main conclusion that the image reconstruction with lasso can retrieve the structure finer than the beam size . on the other hand",
    ", the middle panel of figures [ fig : one - dim - with - noise ] corresponds to the case with a noise level of 15% . in this plot",
    ", one can see that larger noise gradually affects the result , as the flux ratio of the two peaks become different from the initial values ( originally 1 to 0.8 ) , but more power is concentrated to the component at @xmath25 .",
    "also the positions of the two peaks are slightly shifted by @xmath99 , but this is still fairly smaller than the beam size itself .",
    "hence such a super - resolution image may be still acceptable depending on what kind of conclusion is drawn from the image .    in the right panel of figures [ fig :",
    "one - dim - with - noise ] , we show the case with 25% noise level ( which corresponds to a case in which snr in only 4 even at the visibility peak ) . in this case , the effect of noise is significant , as the two peaks are merged into one , and there is no sign of the double peak structure . above simulation results show : 1 ) that the super - resolution technique proposed in this paper can be of use for practical cases in which the observational noise exists , and 2 ) that the super - resolution image requires relatively good snr ratio , as easily expected .    for other separations ,",
    "basically smaller separation case becomes more sensitive to noise : for instance , in case of @xmath100 , addition of noise larger than 3% level would make it impossible to separate the two peaks .",
    "therefore , very high super - resolution factor is not practical in terms of the tolerance against noise .",
    "however , as we have seen in figure [ fig : one - dim - with - noise ] , super - resolution factor of a few is applicable even under the existence of noise .",
    "it is remarkable to point out that the solutions by lasso shown in figure [ fig : one - dim - with - noise ] have a baseline which exactly matches zero other than at the location of the signal ( around @xmath25 and @xmath98 ) , without any noise floor .",
    "this apparent cancellation of the noise is also due to the sparse modeling : while solutions with noise floors could have moderately smaller value in the error term @xmath101 ( the first term in the argument of the lasso equation ) , such solutions with noise floor should have a large number of non - zero components in @xmath49 , and thus they are discarded due to the large penalty term , @xmath102 . as such , the preferred solution by sparse modeling tends to have zero baseline and thus noise is apparently reduced ( though it is not necessarily clear if the apparently noiseless image is indeed a better representation of the reality or not . since this is beyond the scope of our paper , we leave this issue for future studies ) .",
    "( 85mm,85mm)figure5-v2.eps    ( 160mm,100mm)figure6-v2.eps    now we discuss two dimensional case , which corresponds to actual imaging of astronomical objects using radio interferometer . in particular , here we consider an application of the super - resolution technique to vlbi observations of black hole shadow , in which obtaining high resolution is fundamental",

    "currently three sites in us ( carma : combined array for research in millimeter - wave , smto : submillimeter telescope observatory , jcmt : james clerk maxwell telescope / sma : submillimeter array / cso : caltech submillimeter observatory ) are operational at 1.3 mm and producing scientific results on regular basis ( e.g. , doeleman et al . 2008 ; 2012 ; lu et al . 2012 ; 2013 ) . in the present paper",
    ", we consider an array with six stations including additional three stations which are to be realized in near future , namely , alma ( atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ) in chile , lmt ( large millimeter telescope ) in mexico , and iram ( institute de radio astronomie millimtrique ) 30 m in spain .",
    "all the latter three stations have concrete plans for participating sub - mm vlbi observations ( alma and lmt ) or even already have test observations ( iram ) .",
    "thus the six - station array considered here is likely to be operational soon .",
    "as for the observing wavelength , we take @xmath103 mm ( or a frequency @xmath104 of 230 ghz ) , which is more easily available than a shorter wavelength such as @xmath105 mm , although both wavelengths are within the scope of the eht project .    for the target source ,",
    "here we consider m87 , which is one of the best target along with the galactic center black hole sgr a * in terms of apparent shadow size .",
    "the mass of m87 s black hole is still matter of debate : while gebhardt & thomas ( 2009 ) suggested a mass of 6.4(@xmath1060.5 ) @xmath107 , recent re - evaluation of the black hole mass gives a mass of @xmath108 ( walsh et al .",
    "2013 , see also macchetto et al .",
    "1997 for earlier studies suggesting a small mass ) .",
    "the latter is smaller by a factor of two than the previous estimate by gebhardt & thomas ( 2009 ) .",
    "if one adopts a mass of @xmath108 and a distance of 17 mpc , the expected diameter of the black hole shadow is around 20 @xmath6as for a non - rotating black hole , and it could be smaller for a spinning black hole .",
    "figure [ fig : uv ] shows eht s uv - coverage plot for m87 ( at a source declination of @xmath109 ) . here",
    "we assume that the source is observed for an elevation angle beyond 20 deg at each station .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : uv ] , the maximum baseline length is around 9000 km , and hence for an observing wavelength of 1.3 mm , this array provides an angular resolution of @xmath110 @xmath6as . in this case , the angular resolution ( the standard beam size ) could be still larger than the expected size of the shadow diameter ( in particular for the case of small mass and/or high spin black hole ) .",
    "hence it could be difficult to resolve the shadow based on the standard imaging synthesis in case of the small mass .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to test if the super - resolution technique effectively boost the image resolution to resolve the black hole shadow .",
    "we conducted simulations for two cases of the black hole shadow of m87 : a ring - like shadow and a crescent shadow ( both with a diameter of 20 @xmath6as ) . here , in order to emulate real observations , we assume that visibilities are sampled every 10 minutes with the ( @xmath111 ) coverage shown in figure [ fig : uv ] , and also random noises are added to visibilities at a 5%-level of the peak flux : in order words , visibility snr is 20 for the shortest baseline and smaller for longer baselines ( visibility amplitude decreases with baseline length as source structure is partially resolved out with longer baseline ) .",
    "the images are reconstructed by applying lasso to the simulated visibilities ( as described in section 3.4 ) , and convolved with a super - resolution beam which is smaller than the standard synthesized beam by a factor of 4 .",
    "note that in this simulation there are 976 visibility samples .",
    "since the solution dimension ( the number of image grids ) is @xmath112 , the problem studied here is in fact an underdetermined one .    in figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] , we show the results for the ring - like shadow in the top panels , and for the crescent shadow in the bottom panels , respectively .",
    "all the images have 64@xmath11364 grids , with a grid size of 1 @xmath6as .",
    "the left panels of figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] show initial model images that are convolved with a super - resolution beam which is four times finer than the standard synthesized beam size .",
    "the middle panels are images convolved with the standard synthesized beam ( the synthesize beam size is 33@xmath11329 @xmath6as with a position angle of 30 deg ) .",
    "the right panels show images reconstructed with lasso .",
    "the right panels of figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] clearly show the super - resolution images using sparse modeling indeed reproduce the detailed structure within the synthesized beam : while the shadow structures can not be seen in the standard - beam - convolved images ( in the middle panel of figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] ) , in the super - resolution images the ring / crescent structures are clearly reconstructed .",
    "of course , the existence of the noise in the present simulation avoids the perfect matches between the initial image and reconstructed image .",
    "however , basic structures of brightness distribution are traced well .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure7-v2.eps    to clarify the advantage of the super - resolution technique over the standard images , in figure [ fig : shadow - cross - section ] we show the cross section of the ring results ( the top panels of figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] ) along @xmath114 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : shadow - cross - section ] , the twin peaks ( corresponding to the ring ) are well - reproduced in the super - resolution image . on the other hand , in the standard imaging ,",
    "the two peaks are merged into a single component due to the convolution effect , and it is difficult to retrieve the two peaks from the convolved image based on the standard clean algorithm . here",
    "we note that in the clean process , clean component is always set at the peak in the convolved image , and hence the cleaned imaged should have a single peak at @xmath115 rather than two peaks at @xmath116 @xmath6as .",
    "therefore , in the cases shown in figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] , the super - resolution technique using sparse modeling indeed has strong advantage against the standard imaging , and the results here demonstrate that the super - resolution technique will be of great help to resolve the shadow of super - massive black holes .",
    "( 170mm,80mm)figure8-v2.eps      in order to evaluate how the resultant image varies with a choice of @xmath60 , here we solve the same problem in the previous section by varying @xmath60 .",
    "figures [ fig : bh - shadow - with - lambda ] show the ring cases ( corresponding to those in the upper panels of figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] ) with four values of @xmath60 , 0.01 , 1 , 100 , and 10000 .",
    "note that the image area has the same size with those in figures [ fig : bh - shadow ] .",
    "also note that in figures [ fig : bh - shadow - with - lambda ] , the convolution with the super - resolution beam size , which is included in figure [ fig : bh - shadow ] , is not taken into account , so that the difference between the solutions can be directly compared in detail .    for @xmath60 smaller than 100 ,",
    "basic trend is common : the ring - like structure within the standard beam size is recovered well . on the other hand , for very large @xmath60 case ( @xmath117 ) , the @xmath57 regularization term imposes very strong sparsity in the solution , and hence most of the power is forced to concentrate to four arclets along the ring - like structure .",
    "certainly this result shows that introduction of too much sparsity could result in non - realistic image which is over - simplified .",
    "however , for modest range of @xmath60 , the lasso solution provides reasonable representation of the initial model .",
    "if a priori information on the source is available ( such as rough idea on how the source image appear ) , then such information would be helpful for discriminating the two different types of solutions in figures [ fig : bh - shadow - with - lambda ] . or , even if there is no a priori information on the possible source structure , the lasso solutions with wide range of @xmath60 can still provide a few possible classes of solutions ( such as the one for @xmath118 and the one for @xmath117 ) , which is still very helpful for constraining the source structure .",
    "here we briefly discuss issues related to this study , especially those important when implementing the super - resolution technique to real data analysis of mm and sub - mm vlbi .      in the present study we focused on black hole shadow images in which emissions are confined to the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "such an image is expected to be sparse in the image domain , and hence the sparse modeling technique works successfully to reconstruct images with super - resolution .",
    "the key here is that mm / sub - mm vlbi array , such as eht , has relatively low sensitivity and sparse @xmath119 coverage , and hence the observation works as a filter to extract compact and bright components from real images ( in other words , extended structures are resolved out ) . in reality , however , black holes could have extended structure such as accretion disk and jets . with technical development in vlbi as well as sensitivity upgrade of the array ,",
    "relatively faint and extended structure would become detectable in near future .",
    "then , the assumption of  sparsity in the image domain  would no longer hold , and the sparse modeling should be modified in order to reconstruct the true image .",
    "how can we treat such a none - sparse image with the technique of sparse modeling ?",
    "as far as black hole shadows are concerned , one way to handle such a problem is to separate extended components and the compact component associated with the black hole , to the latter of which one would like to apply the super - resolution technique .",
    "this approach can be realized with following steps : first , apply the standard imaging ( fourier transformation with zero - padding and clean ) to the data and obtain the map including extended structure and the compact component ( which are convolved with the standard synthesized beam ) .",
    "secondly , the contribution of extended structures are subtracted from the observed visibilities .",
    "this can be done by subtracting visibility contribution of the clean components of extended structure .",
    "the remaining visibilities are associated only with the compact component and thus now the image is expected to be sparse ( without extended structures ) . at this stage",
    "one can apply the lasso to obtain a super - resolution image of the black hole shadow , as we have already demonstrated in the previous sections .",
    "another possible approach is to modify the regularization term in equation ( [ eq : lasso ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the field of imaging , the regularization term based on total variation ( tv : @xmath120 ) is often used .",
    "the regularization with tv prefer smoother distribution of power with less discreteness .",
    "thus , inclusion of the tv term could lead to better imaging of extended structure , but a trade - off is that this would lower resolution compared to that of the regularization only with @xmath57-norm . to optimize the image , combination of the two regularization term could be used for tracing both compact and extended sources .    in more general cases",
    ", one might be interested in applying the sparse modeling technique to astronomical objects other than black holes .",
    "in such a case , the main reasoning of applying the sparse modeling is not super - resolution , but there is still significant merit because solving an underdetermined problem without zero - padding avoids generation of side - lobes , and it avoids process like clean which often requires non - automated interactive analysis .",
    "previous works by @xcite and @xcite discussed such a general application .",
    "we note that in such a case , there is no guarantee that the image is sparse in the image domain , and hence the lasso and compressive sensing may not work in the manner presented here .    to overcome this",
    ", it is fundamental to transform the image to another domain in which the corresponding ",
    "solution becomes sparse .",
    "one of such possible transformation is wavelet , as the wavelet transformation is known to make natural images sparse in the wavelet domain ( and hence it is used for image compression ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite intensively studied imaging by isotropic decimated wavelet transform , and demonstrated its advantage over the standard clean process .",
    "however , we note that if the sparse solution is obtained in a different domain such as wavelet , it is not guaranteed if the resolution could be better than the standard imaging , and hence it may not be an effective approach for black hole imaging .      the discussion in this paper so far implicitly assumed that we can obtain both visibility amplitude and phase , i.e. , complete visibilities as complex . in normal interferometer such as connected arrays and cm vlbi arrays , this is often the case .",
    "however , for sub - mm vlbi there is possibility that low sensitivity and/or poor weather condition prevent from obtaining complete visibilities ( usually phase is more difficult to obtain ) . in such a case ,",
    "an alternative quantity ( less complete but far better than nothing ) is bi - spectrum , which is a triple product of visibilities from three triangular baselines , i.e. , @xmath121 here subscripts 1 , 2 and 3 denote stations in the triangle , and set of two subscripts denotes the relevant baseline with the two stations .",
    "bi - spectrum ( or closure phase when its phase is concerned ) is relatively easy to obtain compared to individual phases such as @xmath122 . in fact , even when visibility phase is difficult to obtain , in vlbi observations , bi - spectrum can be measured based on incoherent averaging ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , bi - spectrum are available with optical / infrared interferometer , and its use in image reconstruction has been investigated ( e.g. , bsmem , an image reconstruction from bi - spectrum with maximum entropy method , see @xcite ) .",
    "if the only available phase is the closure quantity , one can not write the observational equations ( the two - dimensional fourier transform ) in linear equations , and thus the sparse modeling such as compressive sensing / lasso can not be applied .",
    "this would severely limit the application of the technique discussed in the present paper .    to overcome this limitation ,",
    "an iterative approach could be used . as a first step ,",
    "one creates an initial model image based on the observed bi - spectrum and/or a priori knowledge of the astronomical object .",
    "then , by combining the initial image with observed bi - spectrum , visibilities ( amplitude + phase ) are estimated for each baseline . once full",
    "set of visibilities are estimated , one can apply sparse modeling to the estimated visibilities to obtain an image .",
    "of course , the obtained image may not be a good representation of the true image because the visibilities are estimated from bi - spectrum and the initial model image . to improve the image , one estimate",
    "the complete visibilities again based on the new image and observed bi - spectrum , and apply the sparse modeling again to refine the image .",
    "such procedures are conducted iteratively until the image converges .",
    "such an iterative technique is used in the analysis of x - ray diffraction images , in which the basic equation is the same to the radio interferometer , but phases are never observed ( the technique is called as  phase retrieval  , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the iterative treatment would be helpful to find a good solution which represents the observed bi - spectrum well , as long as the initial image is properly chosen .",
    "testing whether or not this scheme works for black hole imaging would be of great interest and will be a good target for near future work .",
    "in the present paper , we presented super - resolution imaging technique based on sparse modeling . usually interferometric imaging is underdetermined problem that has an infinite number of possible solutions . we showed that selecting one solution from many possible solutions can provide better resolution than the standard images obtained with  zero - padding  , and we demonstrated that sparse modeling , in particular lasso in this paper , can be used to select a solution based on the sparsity of the solution . based on the simulations , we found that the above scheme works well both for one - dimensional and two - dimensional cases , and especially demonstrated its power when applied to vlbi observations of black hole shadows .",
    "therefore , the super - resolution technique will hopefully have a strong impact in future observations with radio interferometry .",
    "the authors would like to thank for masato okada , kenji nagata , hiroshi nagai and daisuke kuroda for fruitful discussions .",
