    "ferrofluids ( magnetic fluids ) are colloidal suspensions containing single domain nanosize ferromagnetic particles dispersed in a carrier liquid  @xcite .",
    "these particles are usually stabilized against agglomeration by coating them with long - chain molecules ( steric stabilization ) , or decorating them with charged groups ( electrostatic stabilization ) .",
    "since these particles can easily interact via applied magnetic fields , which in turn can affect the viscosity and structural properties , ferrofluids possess a wide variety of potential applications in many fields ranging from mechanical engineering  @xcite to biomedical applications  @xcite .",
    "thus , ferrofluids have received much attention in the scientific community  @xcite .",
    "polydispersity of ferrofluids emerges naturally since the particles in them always possess a log - normal distribution  @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that different microstructures can spontaneously form in ferrofluids  @xcite .",
    "this has a strong effect on the macroscopic properties of ferrofluids . in this regard ,",
    "the influence of polydispersity on the magnetization of ferrofluids is of both academic and practical interest . due to the polydispersity of ferrofluids",
    ", their structure and magnetization properties may significantly differ from those of monodisperse systems  @xcite .",
    "the structure of polydisperse ferrofluids has been discussed theoretically on the basis of a bidisperse model in which the fluids consist of two fractions of magnetic particles with significant size differences  @xcite . in a bidisperse ferrofluid ,",
    "the smaller particles are affected by brownian motion , and are therefore more or less randomly dispersed .",
    "the larger magnetic dipole moment of the larger particles leads , however , to a strong interparticle force which dominates over brownian motion .",
    "thus the salient structure in these systems is proposed to be a chainlike aggregate formed by the larger particles .",
    "some small particles may be attached to the ends of these aggregates , but most of them remain in the non - aggregated state  @xcite .",
    "these features have also been observed in langevin dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , wang and holm  @xcite found that the smaller particles hinder the aggregation of larger particles .",
    "since then , that effect has been investigated in detail by zubarev  @xcite , and the influence of polydispersity on the equilibrium properties of ferrofluids was very recently investigated by kristf and szalai using monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "kristf and szalai found that magnetization is generally higher in a polydisperse system than in the corresponding monodisperse one .",
    "an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath0 exerts a translational force @xmath1 on a ferromagnetic particle given by = + * m*_0 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the permanent magnetic dipole moment and the magnetizability of the particle , respectively .",
    "thus , if the permanent moment points in the direction of @xmath0 , the particles will be displaced towards the regions of higher field strength . in a macroscopic sample the average moment is in the direction of the field , i.e. , the particles favor orientations where their permanent magnetic dipole moments are directed along the field .",
    "thus , an inhomogeneous field acting on a macroscopic sample causes a concentration gradient with high concentrations at high field strengths . if a sample is situated partially in a field and held at constant pressure , the particle density in the field region will increase leading to an increase of the permeability",
    "this effect is called magnetostriction , or in general , a response of the solution to an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "magnetostriction has been extensively studied , e.g. , in dipolar fluids  @xcite , single crystals of the high-@xmath4 cuprate @xmath5  @xcite , polycrystalline fe films  @xcite , and in cylindrical type - ii superconductors  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , to the best of our knowledge , so far there is neither theory nor experiments dealing with the important problem of magnetostriction of ferrofluids .",
    "the only notable exception is ferrogels  @xcite which are chemically cross - linked polymer networks swollen with a ferrofluid .    to model ferrofluids we use a thermodynamical method to derive the magnetostriction - induced effective third - order nonlinear magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 .",
    "as a sinusoidal ac magnetic field is applied , the magnetization will , in general , consist of ac fields at frequencies of the higher - order harmonics .",
    "we derive the harmonics analytically by using a perturbation approach .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to exploit magnetostriction in ferrofluids in order to generate a nonlinear response and thus a harmonic response . in experiments , measurements of the harmonic responses of magnetization",
    "have been used to obtain information of the anisotropy distribution in a ferromagnetic amorphous alloy  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility arising from the magnetostriction is derived , and the harmonics of the magnetization are extracted analytically . in sec .",
    "iii , we numerically calculate the harmonics of the magnetization under various conditions .",
    "we finish with a discussion and conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "let us assume that a ferrofluid is placed in an inhomogeneous magnetic field and kept at constant pressure . then",
    ", the density of the particles in the field regions will increase due to the interaction between the permanent magnetic moments of the particles and the field leading to an increase in the permeability .",
    "this effect is called magnetostriction .",
    "the experimental situation is the following : there is a field - affected volume with volume @xmath7 in which the magnetic field and the magnetic induction are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "both of them should satisfy the usual magnetostatic equations  @xcite , @xmath10 here eq .  ( [ ec ] ) implies that the magnetic field @xmath11 can be expressed as the gradient of a magnetic scalar potential @xmath12 such that _ c = - . under appropriate boundary conditions , the inhomogeneous ferrofluid inside the field - affected volume can be represented as a region of volume @xmath13 surrounded by a surface @xmath14 .",
    "such boundary conditions can be written as = - * h*ons , which , if the ferrofluid within @xmath15 were uniform , would give rise to a magnetic field which is identical to @xmath0 ( external field ) everywhere within @xmath16 in fact , this boundary condition guarantees that even in an inhomogeneous ferrofluid the volume average of the magnetic field @xmath17 within @xmath15 still equals that of the external field , @xmath18 , namely , _",
    "c(*x*)d^3x = . in this case",
    "there is no external field outside the field - affected volume and ( or , in practice , the external field in other areas is weak enough to be neglected ) .",
    "the ferrofluid with volume @xmath19 is situated such that it has regions both inside and outside the field - affected volume at a constant pressure  @xmath20 .    in the presence of an inhomogeneous external magnetic field @xmath0 ,",
    "the effective linear permeability @xmath21 and the effective third - order nonlinear magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 for the ferrofluid inside the field - affected volume are defined as _",
    "c = ( _ e + 4 ^ 2 ) , [ delf1 ] where @xmath22 denotes the volume average .",
    "( [ delf1 ] ) implies that there is a nonlinear relation between the magnetization , @xmath23 , and the magnetic field , @xmath24 .",
    "this will be explicitly shown later in eq .",
    "( [ mor ] ) .",
    "further , it is worth noting that the nonlinear term @xmath6 of the magnetic susceptibility is actually an effective quantity .",
    "it appears due to the fact that the particles can receive a translational force which drives them into the field - affected volume in the presence of an inhomogeneous field . in this regard ,",
    "rather than @xmath0 we should use @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ delf1 ] ) in order to derive the ( effective ) nonlinear term @xmath6 .",

    "( [ delf1 ] )  and  ( [ muh ] ) , the total effective third - order nonlinear susceptibility generally contains two contributions .",
    "the first is the magnetostriction - induced one considered in this work , and the other is the normal - saturation contribution . at large field intensities , the higher terms of the langevin function",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "this contribution is negative , and is called normal saturation .",
    "in contrast , the magnetostriction has a positive contribution . in this work",
    ", we assume that the field is moderate such that the normal - saturation contribution is weak enough to be neglected .",
    "it should be noted that the argument of the langevin function can become large for a very small number of large particles in the tail of the size distribution .",
    "further , we shall also neglect the normal - saturation contribution resulting from the very small amount of the large particles since this contribution might be expected to have a very weak effect on the total effective third order susceptibility . to summarize the above , throughout this work ,",
    "only the magnetostriction - induced contribution is considered .    using the above assumptions @xmath34 can be given by the anisotropic clausius - mossotti equation , namely  @xcite = _",

    "regarding eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) , more issues should be remarked .",
    "it is known that the usual ( isotropic ) clausius - mossotti equation does not include the particle - particle interaction .",
    "when lo and yu studied the field - induced structure transformation in electrorheological solids , they succeeded in developing a generalized clausius - mossotti equation by introducing a local - field factor @xmath42 which reflects the particle - particle interaction between the particles in an anisotropic lattice .",
    "this generalized clausius - mossotti approach [ eq .  ( [ cme ] ) ] is a self - consistent determination of the local field due to a lattice of dipole moments . in other words , eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) should be expected to include particle - particle interactions ( at least to some extent ) , and the degree of the particle - particle interactions depends on how much @xmath43 deviates from @xmath44 ( note that here @xmath45 ) , where @xmath43 represents the demagnetizing factor in the longitudinal field case . in particular , the case when @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) corresponds to the isotropic case , which yields the well - known ( isotropic ) clausius - mossotti equation .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a sum rule @xmath48  @xcite , where @xmath49 is the demagnetizing factor in the transverse field case . for electrorheological fluids ,",
    "similar factors were measured in simulations  @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) , the term @xmath50 results from the average contribution of the permanent magnetic dipole moment to the average value of the work required to bring a particle with diameter @xmath38 into the field @xmath51 .",
    "more precisely , the mean value of the component of the dipole moment in the direction of the field is given by m_0(d)l ( ) = h , with @xmath52 .",
    "that is , we set the langevin function to @xmath53 . regarding this relation ,",
    "the following issues should be noted . in the present work",
    ", we shall adopt a perturbation approach  @xcite [ see sec .",
    "ii(c ) ] , which is suitable for a weak nonlinearity . in the perturbation approach",
    ", it is well established that the effective third - order nonlinear susceptibility can be calculated from the linear field  @xcite , while the effective higher - order nonlinearity must depend on the nonlinear field  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we could have adopted a self - consistent mean - field approach  @xcite , but the perturbation approach appears to be more convenient for analytic expressions  @xcite .",
    "thus , to be able to focus on ( weak ) third - order nonlinearity , it suffices to use the clausius - mossotti equation [ eq .  ( [ cme ] ) ] by taking into account the linear relation only , i.e. , @xmath54 due to the same reason , in what follows we shall omit the contribution from the nonlinear field , too .    regarding the incremental permeability due to the magnetostriction , namely the last term in eq .",

    "the lognormal size distribution of the particles is shown in fig .",
    "again , it is shown that the harmonics increase with increasing median diameter @xmath32 .",
    "finally , to compare the above polydisperse case with the corresponding monodisperse one , we study the monodisperse case in fig .  4 for three different diameters which have the same values as the median diameters used in fig .  2 .",
    "in the monodisperse case , it is also evident that increasing the degree of anisotropy @xmath102 causes both the fundamental and third - order harmonics to increase .",
    "in addition , larger diameter leads to larger harmonics .",
    "it is worthing noting that both the fundamental and third - order harmonics of the magnetization are higher in the polydisperse system than in the monodisperse one when comparing fig .  2 with fig .  4 .",
    "in particular , the third - order harmonics of the polydisperse system can be of two orders of magnitude larger than those of the monodisperse system . in other words ,",
    "the magnetization is higher in the polydisperse system than in the monodisperse one , due to the fact that for this comparison the volume fraction of the particles is fixed .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite where a monte carlo simulation was used to study the influence of polydispersity on the equilibrium properties of ferrofluids .",
    "here some comments are in order . in the present paper , we have exploited magnetostriction in ferrofluids in order to generate nonlinear responses .",
    "the proposed mechanism should work for dc magnetic fields .",
    "it will also work for ac fields with frequency @xmath103 if the size of the sample is not greater than @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the sound velocity .",
    "thus , @xmath106 can be up to khz or so .",
    "otherwise the required mass density oscillations will not be able to keep up with the rapid changes in the magnetic field .    to obtain the lowest - order ( i.e. , cubic ) nonlinearity ,",
    "we have assumed that material properties such as permeability of the polydisperse system can be calculated as a linear superposition of the corresponding values in the monodisperse systems , see eqs .",
    "( [ muh ] ) ,  ( [ cme ] )  and  ( [ density ] ) . for eq .",
    "( [ muh ] ) , the linear superposition should hold since the nonlinear term @xmath6 is actually an effective quantity which results from all the monodisperse systems . for eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) , we used the linear superposition again .",
    "the reason is that the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) actually represents the effective contribution from two parts : the induced magnetization ( which has been assumed to disappear due to the small size of the particles in our numerical calculations ) , and the permanent - moment - related magnetization .",
    "in addition , once the inhomogeneous field is applied , the particles with different sizes are able to move into the field - affected volume , thus yielding an increasing particle density . in this regard , for eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) , the linear superposition should be used naturally .",
    "nonlinear optical materials with large values of ( effective ) third - order nonlinear dielectric susceptibilities  @xcite are in great need in industrial applications such as nonlinear optical switching devices for use in photonics , and real - time coherent optical signal processors , and so on .",
    "due to the similarity between magnetics and dielectrics , the present ( effective ) third - order nonlinear magnetic susceptibilities are expected to have some potential applications in nonlinear magnetic devices .    throughout the paper , only odd - order harmonics are induced to appear . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if one applies an ac magnetic field superimposed to a dc field , the even - order harmonics should appear  @xcite . that is due to the coupling between the two kinds of fields .",
    "on the other hand , since the second - order harmonics are often of several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding third - order , the second - order harmonics are more attractive for the experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "we have considered the fundamental and third - order harmonics .",
    "in fact , we can consider much higher - order harmonics  @xcite , such as fifth- , seventh- , etc .",
    "in doing so , we need to keep more terms in powers of @xmath65 higher than the second in eq .",
    "( [ muee ] ) .",
    "accordingly , more terms should be included in eq .",
    "( [ mor ] ) . however , such higher - order harmonics are often of several orders of magnitude smaller than the third - order , and thus less attractive .    in the numerical calculations , we have omitted the magnetizability of the particles due to the fact that the sizes of the particles are very small in ferrofluids . for these particles ,",
    "the permanent magnetic dipole moments play the main role .",
    "however , in case of a magnetorheological fluid , the magnetizability of the particles should be taken into account since the particle sizes range from @xmath107 to @xmath108@xmath109 m  about three orders of magnitude larger than in ferrofluids .",

    "( [ lnd ] ) ] .",
    "our theory could be extended to treat other particle distributions as well .",

    ", we have used a thermodynamical method to derive the nonlinear magnetic susceptibility resulting from magnetostriction , which further yields the harmonics of magnetization in response to an applied ac magnetic field . for an ideal gas",

    "in addition , we also find that the magnetization is higher in the polydisperse system than in the corresponding monodisperse one , which is in agreement with previous findings .",
