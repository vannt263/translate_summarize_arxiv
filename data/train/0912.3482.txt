    "the translation of the messenger rna ( mrna ) is the final step of protein synthesis . during this process",
    "the information enclosed in the triplet code of the nucleotide chain is _ translated _ into the amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins .",
    "translation is usually viewed as a three - stage process  @xcite : during _ initiation _ a ribosome ( complex of proteins and rna ) binds the mrna molecule ( a sequence of nucleotides previously transcribed from the dna ) and after a series of biochemical reactions , it moves along the chain .",
    "this stage in which the protein is built up amino acid by amino acid according to the mrna sequence is called _ elongation_. each elongation step consists in turn of a series of biochemical reactions which define the ribosome s biochemical cycle .",
    "lastly , the ribosome reaches the termination codon and leaves the mrna releasing the protein .",
    "this last step is called _ termination_. in this paper we propose a model for the elongation stage of mrna translation .",
    "this process , primarily controlled by the dynamics of ribosomes along the mrna chain , bears a resemblance to a one - dimensional driven lattice gas . for this reason ,",
    "the mrna translation inspired a statistical - mechanical class of models known as asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( aseps ) .",
    "they have been introduced in the biophysical literature as models representing the dynamics of ribosomes along an mrna chain @xcite .",
    "later , this class of model has been studied from a more theoretical point of view @xcite and the possible biological applications have been rediscovered only recently , not only for protein synthesis @xcite but also for the movement of molecular motors @xcite .",
    "other non - biological applications have been studied too ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of the asep can be found , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a traditional exclusion process consists of particles moving along a lattice with only steric interactions .",
    "in other words , each lattice site can be occupied just by one particle at a time .",
    "although this approach is interesting from a theoretical point of view , it is however not a realistic way of describing translation since it encompasses the whole ribosomal elongation cycle in a single step .",
    "other approaches to modelling translation include several ( up to fifteen ) distinct phases of the ribosome s mechano - chemical cycle  @xcite .",
    "we want to place ourselves between the class of minimal models and the more detailed models , which are difficult to analyze .",
    "consequently , we consider two fundamental steps of the ribosome s biochemical cycle following a coarse - grained picture ( section  [ sec::model ] ) .",
    "we show that former asep - like models correspond to a limiting case of the model we use .",
    "as will become clear from the discussion , this limiting case is however biologically not plausible , showing the need for an extension of previous models . in the following section we explain the biological framework ( in particular the role of ribosomes and transfer rnas ) and",
    "then in section  [ sec::model ] we introduce the model from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the results for periodic and open - boundary systems are presented in section  [ sec::results ] .",
    "using the same approach as ref .",
    "@xcite we analyze the model in the mean - field approximation and compare this model with a typical exclusion process .",
    "in addition , we show that the same results can be achieved by using an extremal principle  @xcite .",
    "although we observe the same variety of phase transitions that one would expect from the simpler case without the particle s internal states , the locations of the critical points change substantially and depend on the internal dynamics of the particles .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec::conclusions ] we discuss the results and the conclusions from a theoretical and biological viewpoint .",
    "here we briefly introduce the underlying biological process that we want to describe .",
    "more information can be found , e.g. , in refs .",

    "the mrna is a nucleotide chain composed of four different bases ( a , c , g , u ) ; each group of three nucleotides is called a codon and specifies a certain amino acid .",
    "the keys for deciphering the code ( the sequence of codons ) are the transfer rnas ( trnas ) , freely diffusing molecules carrying amino acids .",
    "they have a region composed of three nucleotides ( the anticodon ) matching the corresponding codon on the mrna .",
    "moreover , trnas with the same anticodon transport the same amino acid . in most species , there are 35 - 40 distinct species of trna , each responsible for decoding a particular set of codons .",
    "ribosomes are complexes of proteins and rna which move along the mrna in a fixed direction ( from the 5 to the 3 region , i.e. from the part of the chain that has been transcribed first towards the other end ) and catalyze the assembly of amino acids delivered by trnas .",
    "each ribosome has three regions of interaction for the trna .",
    "they are called aminoacyl ( a ) , peptidyl ( p ) and exit ( e ) sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::1 ] ) .",
    "the main steps of the elongation process are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::2 ] . following the translation initiation ,",
    "a trna is in the p site bound with the first amino acid of the growing polypeptide chain .",
    "then , a complex of ef1@xmath0 @xmath1 gtp @xmath1 trna@xmath2 ( with trna@xmath2 we denote a trna bound to the amino acid @xmath3 ) diffuses into the empty a site on the codon at position @xmath4 . if the anticodon of the trna can not base - pair with the codon , then the complex ef1 @xmath1 gtp @xmath1 trnaaa is released and the process is repeated until a correct trna binds the ribosome .",
    "if on the other hand the correct trna anticodon base - pairs with the corresponding codon on the mrna , then gtp is hydrolyzed and a conformational change in the ribosomal structure occurs .",
    "this change leads to the transfer of the nascent peptide from the p - site trna , to the amino acid carried by the a - site trna .",
    "the altered structure of the ribosome does not allow the cognate trna to unbind and leave the chain .",
    "following the peptidyl transfer reaction and the incorporation of the new amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain , the ribosome translocates one codon ( assuming ribosome progress is not blocked by any stalled ribosomes at downstream positions on the mrna ) .",
    "the translocation process is catalyzed by the complex ef2 @xmath1 gtp which induces a second conformational change in the ribosome .",
    "the trna at the p site is then transferred to the e site .",
    "the ribosome is now back to the first step of its biochemical cycle , with the growing polypeptide chain bound to the trna in the p site and the empty a site on the codon @xmath5 , ready to receive another trna complex .",
    "this process is iterated until the end of the mrna chain , where the ribosome disassociates from the system and releases the synthesized protein .",
    "as soon as initiating ribosomes have moved sufficiently downstream to create space at the beginning of the mrna , a new ribosome can bind the polynucleotide chain .",
    "thus , several ribosomes can translate the same mrna at the same time .",
    "experimental data strongly indicate that searching for the correct trna , and not the translocation , is the rate limiting step of the biochemical cycle of the ribosome  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we shall approximate the whole biochemical cycle of the ribosome by a two - state cycle : ( i ) _ searching _ for the correct trna and ( ii ) _ translocation _ from one codon to the next .    from the modelling point of view",
    ", we shall consider particles changing an internal degree of freedom , or state , which influences their motion .",
    "thus , a ribosome is represented by a two - state particle denoting the absence of the cognate trna in its aminoacyl site ( state @xmath6 ) or its presence ( state @xmath7 ) as outlined in fig .  [ fig::3 ] .",
    "throughout this work we assume that the concentration of charged trnas is homogeneous and large enough to neglect fluctuations ( the transition rates do not change with time ) .",
    "the effects of limited resources  @xcite and their 3d diffusion in the cytoplasm  @xcite are not taken into consideration here .",
    "the individual charged trna concentrations govern the transition rates , which in general depend on the particular type of codon .",
    "( in general depending on the codon @xmath4 ) which mainly models the concentration of trna@xmath2",

    "we describe the mrna molecule as a lattice of discrete sites , each one representing one codon .",
    "ribosomes are represented by particles hopping from one site of the lattice to the next . from a more mathematical perspective",
    ", the occupation number @xmath9 of the site @xmath4 describes the different states in which it can be found .",
    "we say that a site is empty if its occupation number is @xmath10 . a given site @xmath4 occupied by a particle in state @xmath6 or @xmath7 is respectively described by @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "the set @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the length of the lattice , will give the configuration of the system .",
    "the only transitions allowed are the following :    [ eq::rules ] @xmath15    where the first line means that a particle in state @xmath6 at site @xmath4 changes into state @xmath7 with rate @xmath16 , which in general depends on the site @xmath4 .",
    "the second line is a schematic representation of the translocation of a particle in state @xmath7 to the next site .",
    "notice that a hopping particle is carried back to the state @xmath6 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 s change with time according to these dynamical rules .",

    "thus , we shall say that @xmath19 is the mean density of particles in state @xmath6 at site @xmath4 and @xmath20 is the analogous for particles in state @xmath7 .",

    "the main result of this work is that the transitions among the different dynamical regimes of the system occur at different critical points than the ones predicted by former asep models .",
    "these critical points depend on both @xmath99 and @xmath8 .",
    "for example , when @xmath45 is small , the mc phase is substantially enlarged compared to a standard asep with hopping rate @xmath8 and which ignores the internal degree of freedom ( @xmath127 )  , i.e. the inverse of the average waiting time on a site for the two state model . in this case , by decreasing @xmath99 one obtains a mc region that is _ bigger _ than the one obtained with the two state model studied in this work .",
    "we thank paul higgs for this useful comment . ] .",
    "crucially , this is the biologically relevant regime , as shown by estimates of the parameters based on experimental data .",
    "thus , this model describes the biological system much more accurately , and its predictions can be readily validated by experimental measurements .",
    "the analysis of the system with periodic boundary conditions introduces the model and the formalism .",
    "this situation has been studied in  @xcite where the authors propose a mean - field approach to analyse the case with periodic boundary conditions . here",
    "we present a more complete approach which recovers the previous results and , in addition , makes possible the treatment of the model in the open boundary case .",
    "when the ratio between the transition rates @xmath99 and @xmath8 is high , the current profile becomes symmetric and the value of @xmath58 moves toward the expected value of a standard exclusion process .",
    "the deviation between the mean - field and our simulations for low values of the transition rate @xmath99 has yet to be understood .",
    "furthermore , our model with periodic boundary conditions allows us to study whether there is a dominance of particles in state @xmath6 or @xmath7 . in the biological system that we describe ( even if in a coarse - grained perspective ) , a lattice with the majority of sites having @xmath12 represents an mrna in which ribosomes are carrying the cognate trnas and are waiting for hopping .",
    "this might be unfavourable when a finite number of charged trnas is available .",
    "roughly speaking , in these conditions the charged trnas are kept by the ribosomes and can not be used to translate other codons . in this sense the usage of resources is not optimized if @xmath132 .",
    "this result suggests that under starvation or stress conditions , there might be a transition from the @xmath132 to the @xmath133 regime .",
    "we have shown that this extension of the model has important consequences for the different boundary - induced transitions .",
    "namely , depending on the ratio of @xmath99 and @xmath8 , the sizes of the low density ( ld ) , high density ( hd ) and maximal current ( mc ) phases in the @xmath124 parameter space can change substantially , where @xmath0 and @xmath71 represent respectively the initiation and termination rate of ribosomes .",
    "crucially , the phase diagram coincides with the one obtained with the asep if @xmath134 , whereas if @xmath135 , the maximal current phase is enlarged to a great extent , and the transitions from the ld and hd to the mc phase occur at much lower values of @xmath0 and @xmath71 ( depending on the value of @xmath99 , simulations show that the critical points are overestimated by the mean - field approach and the mc region is even larger than predicted ) .    based on experimental data ,",
    "the translocation rate @xmath8 is estimated to be @xmath136 s@xmath137  @xcite ( which is naturally assumed to be constant for each codon ) , and the ratio @xmath45 turns out to be in the range @xmath138 , depending on the codon ( these values are estimates based on  @xcite ) . for most codons ( @xmath139 ) the ratio of the rates is smaller than 1 .",
    "therefore , for physiological conditions , our model predicts a much larger mc phase in the parameter space than previous asep models which completely neglect the internal state of the ribosomes or , equivalently , assume that @xmath134 contrary to the biological conditions . in that unrealistic situation , the ribosomes would find the cognate trnas as soon as they translocate to the next codon .",
    "thus one could naively think that the translation process is optimized to produce the largest possible number of proteins per unit time .",
    "in other words , the current @xmath38 is maximized , and hence the system is in the mc phase .",
    "although this assertion is not justified and there might be cases in which other effects prevent the translation rate to become maximal , such as particular configurations of slow codons downstream of the 5 end of the mrna , competition for common resources and regulation at the level of translation , in this work we find signatures in this direction .",
    "in particular , the model predicts that the mc phase occupies a very large region in the parameter space .",
    "furthermore , the density profiles experimentally observed  @xcite recall the mc density profile of fig .",
    "[ fig::7]b . finally , ribosome recycling  . ] might drive the system to lie in the region with the highest current .",
    "in fact , the injection parameter @xmath0 can be decomposed into two components : one constant coefficient @xmath140 being the affinity of freely diffusing ribosomes to bind to an open mrna , and an increasing function of @xmath38 which represents the probability per unit time that a ribosome leaving the end of the mrna will be recycled .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 might grow until the current balances the maximal current @xmath141 and as a result , @xmath0 is larger or equal to the critical value @xmath92",
    ". the ribosome recycling and its potential impact on translation regulation has been thoroughly investigated in  @xcite .",
    "further studies on the model proposed in this work will address lattices with inhomogeneities ( slow codons ) and the influence of the size of the particles ( ribosomes are known to cover around 9 codons ) . on the biological side , we are planning to implement simulations of real mrna sequences from the _ s. cerevisiae _ genome and validate the model with experiments at different levels .",
    "the authors thank r.  j. allen and m.  r. evans for useful discussions during the development of the model .",
    "one author ( l.  c. ) would also like to thank a. parmeggiani for constructive correspondence and comments of previous versions of the manuscript .",
