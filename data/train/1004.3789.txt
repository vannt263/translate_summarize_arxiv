    "observational evidence has been mounting that the stellar halo of the milky way ( mw ) was likely assembled through a combination of both hierarchical accretions and in situ star formation .",
    "the properties of local halo stars suggest that the galaxy s halo is composed of at least two distinct but overlapping stellar populations @xcite .",
    "these two halo components exhibit different spatial distributions , orbits and metallicities , most likely because each formed through a different mechanism , and on a different timescale . while the outer halo component , which dominates at distances greater than @xmath2 kpc , with [ fe / h ] @xmath3 , is consistent with having been accreted from merged dwarf galaxies , the stars in the more metal rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) inner halo likely formed predominantly in situ @xcite .",
    "studies of the detailed chemical abundances of mw halo stars have sought to place further constraints on the formation of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "these works rely on the behavior of the [ @xmath0/fe ] ratio to indicate the timescale of the star formation history of the halo .",
    "alpha elements are primarily produced in core - collapse supernovae , which occur after @xmath5 years , while the majority of iron is produced in supernovae type ia , whose timescale of @xmath6 years is significantly longer @xcite . in the metallicity range of @xmath7<-0.5",
    "$ ] , inner halo stars are @xmath8 dex more alpha rich than outer halo stars , implying that the galaxy s halo was not uniformly enriched by core - collapse supernovae @xcite . in a local sample of stars , those with [ @xmath0/fe ] @xmath9 show a constant [ @xmath0/fe ] over the above metallicity range , while stars with lower @xmath0-ratio , of about 0.15 , exhibit a decrease in [ @xmath0/fe ] toward higher metallicity @xcite .",
    "similar declines to lower [ @xmath0/fe ] have been observed in dwarf galaxies , though at lower [ fe / h ] values @xcite .",
    "these trends strengthen the argument that the milky way s halo likely hosts two populations of stars , with distinct formation origins .    in the past year",
    ", theoretical results from galaxy simulations have been used to investigate the contribution of in situ stars to the formation history of stellar halos .",
    "using fully cosmological n - body + smooth particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations of four stellar halos surrounding disk galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) showed that while the formation of most stellar halos is dominated by accretion events , a population of in situ stars resides in the inner regions of halos as well .",
    "these in situ halo stars form in the inner most regions of the simulated galaxy and are displaced into the stellar halo through major mergers . in situ stars may also end up in stellar halos , along side accreted stars , through minor accretion events , which heat up disks and eject a small fraction of their stars into kinematic halo orbits @xcite .",
    "previous work on the chemical abundance trends of stellar halos has relied on simulations that only allowed for the formation of stellar halos via hierarchical buildup , using dark - matter only simulations , combined with semi - analytic models @xcite .",
    "these simulations , however , do not have the capability to examine possible chemical abundance trends for in situ halo stars .    in this paper , we use four high resolution cosmological sph+n - body simulations of disk galaxies to investigate the chemical abundance trends of both accreted and in situ halo stars . while past numerical work on chemical abundance trends in halo stars have focused solely on accreted stars , the goal of this work is to test whether in situ and accreted stars are distinguishable using chemical abundance patterns .",
    "the four high - resolution disk galaxy simulations used in this study were chosen to have approximately the same total mass , though with varied merging histories .",
    "three of these simulations ( mw1 , h277 , and h285 ) are discussed in detail in paper i and references therein , while the remaining simulation ( h258 ) is described in @xcite",
    ". these disk dominated galaxies were simulated using gasoline @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize the important features of these simulations below .",
    "mw1 has a total mass of @xmath10 , while the remaining three galaxies , h277 , h258 , and h285 , all have a total mass of @xmath11 .",
    "all have several million particles ( dark matter + gas + stars ) within their virial radius at z=0 .",
    "table 1 lists the primary properties of all four simulations .",
    "a physically motivated recipe was used to describe star formation and supernova feedback @xcite with a uniform uv background that turns on at @xmath12 , resembling cosmic reionization @xcite .    because this work aims to examine the metallicity and alpha abundances of halo stars , the details of the treatment of chemical enrichment are important to this paper .",
    "all of the galaxies used in this study have been rerun since paper i with metal cooling and metal diffusion , which realistically captures the effect of the turbulent interstellar medium ( ism ) on metal mixing @xcite .",
    "metal cooling increases the amount of star formation in these galaxies , and therefore the amount of energy deposited into the local ism by supernova has been increased from 0.4 , in paper i , to 0.7 @xmath13 ergs . the supernova feedback employed in these simulations deposits the energy into the ism , and cooling is turned off for a period of time for those gas particles within the supernova blast wave radius . as described in detail in @xcite , supernova type ia and ii yields",
    "are adopted from @xcite , and @xcite , respectively , and implemented following @xcite .",
    "we follow oxygen and iron yields from sne type ia and core - collapse sne , and use [ o / fe ] as our proxy for [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "these galaxies follow observed local metallicity trends @xcite , as well as metallicity trends at high redshift @xcite .",
    "each simulated galaxy used in this study has been decomposed into a disk , bulge , and halo kinematic component , using the full three - dimensional phase - space information available for all stars .",
    "we use the same decomposition technique as in paper i , but provide all the relevant details here . in order to decompose the disk from the spheroid , we first align the angular momentum vector of the disk with the z - axis .",
    "this places the disk in the x - y plane , and allows us to calculate the angular momentum of each star in that plane , @xmath14 , as well as the momentum of the co - rotating circular orbit with similar orbital energy , @xmath15 .",
    "a star with a circular orbit in the plane of the disk will have @xmath16 in this framework .",
    "stars with @xmath17 are selected as disk stars .",
    "this cut is equivalent to an eccentricity cut of @xmath18 , which matches the eccentricities observed in the milky way s disk @xcite .    in this study , we use only those stars which have orbital characteristics of a stellar halo population .",
    "the spheroid ( halo + bulge ) of each galaxy is defined using a cut in @xmath19 such that the spheroidal population does not exhibit a net rotation .",
    "we can further decompose the spheroid into a bulge and halo because a break in the mass density profile is observed .",
    "stars which are tightly bound to the galaxy - those whose total energy is low- are classified as bulge stars , while all other stars are identified as halo stars .",
    "the energy cut employed is set in order to make a two - component fit to the mass profile of the spheroid .",
    "bulge stars are within the break of the mass profile , and halo stars are outside the break . while there are stars whose kinematics do not make either the disk or spheroid cuts ( thick disk and pseudo bulge stars ) , they are not relevant to this study .",
    "only stars which have been identified by this procedure as belonging to the kinematic halo population are used in this study .    after we have selected the kinematic halo population using the above procedure",
    ", we go on to create an observational sample similar to the sample of halo stars in sdss used by @xcite . to simulate an observer at the solar position , we place the `` sun '' at a distance of @xmath20 3 disk radial scale lengths away from the center , and then calculate the heliocentric distances of each star .",
    "the radial scale length of each simulated disk is listed in table 1 .",
    "while @xcite only observe stars out to a volume less than 4 kpc from the sun , we have chosen to study halo stars within 10 kpc of the simulated heliocentric observer .",
    "the foremost reason for this 10 kpc cut - off is that nearly all of the in situ stars ( @xmath21 , described in the following section ) in the simulated halos are within the inner @xmath22 kpc of the stellar halos .",
    "second , many studies of the milky way s stellar halo have used f & g type stars , which are currently observed out to a few tens kpc . to match a large ground based survey like sdss",
    "we restrict our observed sample to stars more than 30 degrees above and more than 1 kpc above the plane of the disk , for a heliocentric observer .",
    "stars that are classified as belonging to the halo in the kinematic decomposition , and which fit the spatial and sdss - like cuts are referred to as part of the observed halo sample .",

    "we trace the formation history of each star particle located within the virial radius of the main galaxy at @xmath35 back to @xmath36 , as well as follow the gas particles from which the stars have formed . at each time step output by the simulation ( every 25 myr )",
    ", we identify the dark matter halo to which each particle belonged using ahf@xcite .",
    "a star is considered bound to a dark matter halo only if it is identified as belonging to that halo for at least two consecutive time steps . using this technique we identify three different formation origins : accreted , in situ , and ambiguous . for a detailed description of this procedure , and a discussion of numerical issues ,",
    "the reader is referred to paper i. we quickly review the three classifications below .",
    "accreted stars formed in halos other than the main galaxy s dark matter halo . through merging , these stars have become unbound to their progenitors and now belong to the main galaxy s halo . the majority of the accreted stars in the halos of h277 , h285 , and mw1 ( 75% by mass in stars ) , originated in @xmath37 subhalos , each with a total mass of @xmath38 .",
    "the majority of accreted stars in h258 , which experiences several major mergers , as discussed in section 3 , originate in three galaxies , with total masses ranging from 2.5 to 6 @xmath39 .    in situ stars , on the other hand , formed within the main galaxy s potential well , with their gas progenitors bound to the main galaxy before their formation .",
    "paper i found this population formed within the inner @xmath40 kpc of the galaxy s center before being displaced into the kinematic halo component as a result of mergers .",
    "stars which are classified as ambiguous , @xmath41 of the total halo stars , have an unknown formation history due to the limited number of time steps output for each simulation .",
    "this occurs if a gas particle spawns a star particle at approximately the same time that it first becomes bound to the primary . in such cases",
    "it is uncertain whether the star formed in the primary or in its original subhalo .",
    "all four of the simulated galaxies analyzed in this paper host a stellar halo which contains both accreted and in situ stars .",
    "while the relative contribution of each population differs from halo to halo , the presence of stars with a dual origin is a generic feature of the stellar halos surrounding @xmath1 galaxies at z=0 . in paper i",
    "we showed that the fraction of in situ stars present in a halo depends strongly on the merging history of the primary galaxy .",
    "the in situ population of galaxies with very active merging histories , and which therefore host massive accreted halos , is diluted in comparison to the in situ halo population of galaxies which have not accreted as many stars during their lifetimes .",
    "as suggested by their in situ fractions , h285 and h258 have much more active merging histories than mw1 and h277 ( table 2 ) .",

    "we now examine the trends in chemical abundances displayed by the observed halo stars .",
    "one expects that the chemical abundance pattern of a stellar population will be set by the star formation history of the galaxy in which the population formed .",
    "for this reason we aim to find trends which differentiate the in situ and accreted populations in each stellar halo .",
    "these qualitative trends in metallicity are robust , and applicable not just to the milky way , but to milky way - mass galaxies with different merging histories , as discussed in detail below , and in section 4 .",
    "massive galaxies form in deep potential wells , and consequently have higher star formation rates ( sfr ) than less massive galaxies , resulting in a mass - metallicity relation @xcite . with their high sfr , massive galaxies will reach higher [ fe / h ] at relatively constant [ @xmath0/fe ] before sne ia begin to contribute , as core - collapse sne enrich the ism with mostly alpha elements , and little iron or iron - peak elements . in lower mass galaxies , however , lower sfrs mean that the galaxy ca nt enrich as much in fe before sne type ia began to contribute , resulting in a decrease of [ @xmath0/fe ] at lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "additionally , galaxies with long star formation histories will form stars out of gas that has been enriched by both core - collapse sne and sne type ia , whereas galaxies with truncated star formation histories will have their abundance pattern set primarily by core - collapse sne .",
    "these trends are shown in figure 1 .",
    "if the in situ and accreted populations each formed at different times , under different physical conditions , we expect to see that reflected in their abundance patterns .",
    "we indeed find that in three of our galaxies ( those without a very recent major merger ) in situ halo stars at the high [ fe / h ] end of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) tend to be more alpha rich than the similarly high [ fe / h ] accreted stars ( figure 3 , discussed in detail below ) . at lower [ fe / h ] ,",
    "we find that the two populations have similar [ o / fe ] . because we only follow oxygen and iron in these simulations [ o / fe ] serves as our proxy for [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "before we discuss our findings in detail , it is important to first note that the satellites of the simulated galaxies studied here are brighter , and hence are more [ fe / h]-rich , than those observed in the milky way @xcite . if the satellites which built up our simulated stellar halos contained less stellar mass at a given total mass the qualitative chemical abundance patterns for in situ and accreted halo stars discussed below would not change , as we demonstrate in detail in section 4 . the results in metallicity",
    "we discuss , however , are not meant to be absolute , and the qualitative trends are robust for milky way - mass galaxies .    as discussed in section 2.2 , in situ stars formed in the innermost regions of the primary galaxy s dark - matter halo , and were displaced into the halo through massive mergers .",
    "since the redshift of the last significant merger ( table 2 ) determines the last time at which in situ stars are substantially displaced into the halo , the formation time of the in situ populations of each galaxy is quite different .",
    "the left panel of figure 2 shows the time of formation for in situ halo stars ( solid lines ) and accreted halo stars ( dashed lines ) in each simulated observed sample . because mw1 and h277 experience their last significant merger early on , at z@xmath46 , the in situ stars in these galaxies all formed before @xmath47 gyr .",
    "the late mergers of h285 and h258 , at z=2 , and z=1 , respectively , result in younger in situ populations in these halos .",
    "the right panel of figure 2 shows the time at which accreted halo stars first became unbound from their satellites and were accreted onto the primary halo . while the majority of the accreted stars in h277 and mw1 become bound to these galaxies early on ( with 90 % of such stars being accreted at times @xmath48 gyr ) , h285 and h258 accreted a large number of their halo stars at times later than this .",
    "figure 3 shows [ fe / h ] vs [ o / fe ] of in situ halo stars ( in red triangles ) and accreted halo stars ( in black circles ) for each simulated observed halo sample .",
    "we find that in mw1 , and h277 ( top two panels of figure 3 ) , where @xmath49 of in situ halo stars formed within a 1 gyr time span in a deep potential well , the ism did not have time to enrich with sne type ia , and so the [ @xmath0/fe ] of these stars is approximately constant with [ fe / h ] .",
    "the accreted stars in these halos , however , which formed slightly later on , and in shallower potential wells than the in situ stars , experienced a slower star formation rate , resulting in a decrease of their [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "while the accreted stars of h285 ( bottom left panel of figure 3 ) display a similar trend in [ @xmath0/fe ] to the accreted populations of h277 and mw1 , its in situ population does not display a constant [ @xmath0/fe ] like the other galaxies .",
    "the in situ population of this galaxy had more time to form ( because of the later merger ) , and formed in a smaller galaxy than mw1 and h277 s in situ stars . at z=3 ,",
    "the total virial masses of h277 and mw1 are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , whereas h285 s mass is only @xmath52 . because of this , the in situ stars of h285 display a turn over in [ o / fe ] at lower [ fe / h ] , rather than remaining constant at higher metallicities like mw1 and h277 .",
    "unlike the other galaxies , h258 ( bottom right panel of figure 3 ) experiences a nearly 1:1 merger at z=1 . the in situ and accreted stars in this galaxy do not follow a similar trend to the other galaxies .",
    "the in situ halo population in this galaxy had longer to form ( figure 2 , left panel ) , and hence were enriched to a lower [ @xmath0/fe ] than the other in situ halo populations . furthermore , because of its binary merger , many of the h258 in situ stars have similar chemical abundances to the accreted population .",
    "this galaxy has undergone three massive accretion events in its lifetime , whose `` tracks '' are evident in figure 3 .",
    "the primary result of this study is that in situ halo stars have higher [ @xmath0/fe ] than accreted halo stars at the high [ fe / h ] end of the mdf . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the role of simulation effects in this study and the robustness of our primary results to these effects .",
    "the most relevant numerical issue in this study is that the satellites of the simulated galaxies are brighter than those observed in the milky way @xcite . while the milky way hosts only two satellites with @xmath53 , the large and small magellanic clouds , the four simulated galaxy halos have , on average , four satellite companions in this luminosity range at z=0 .",
    "brighter satellites will of course contribute more accreted stars to a given stellar halo .",
    "this affects our results in two pertinent ways .",
    "first , the fractional contribution of in situ stars to each stellar halo is likely under - estimated , as discussed in paper i. second , because our simulated satellites contain too many stars , they are also more [ fe / h ] rich than we expect for the satellites that contributed to milky way - mass stellar halos .",
    "the differing [ @xmath0/fe ] trends displayed by the in situ and accreted halo components is a robust prediction for milky way - massed galaxy halos that is not undermined by the details of the present simulations mdfs .",
    "had our simulated halos been built up from satellites that were less luminous at a given total satellite mass , the trends shown in figure 3 would have simply been shifted to lower [ fe / h ] . to demonstrate this , we have re - simulated one of the galaxies in this paper ( mw1 ) with the same exact initial conditions but with differently calibrated supernova feedback and star formation .",
    "the physical treatment of these processes is unchanged in the new simulation .",
    "the new run employed a stronger supernova feedback , with an increase in thermal sne energy from 0.7 to 1 @xmath54 ergs , and the threshold for star formation density has been increased to from 0.1 to 1 amu/@xmath55 . as a result of the stronger feedback , and higher density threshold , at z=0 the new simulated halo hosts only two satellites in the luminosity range @xmath56 .",
    "the new mw1 stellar halo also has a mdf that is similar to that observed of halo stars in m31 @xcite . in the inner 30 kpc of its stellar halo , stars in the new mw1 have @xmath57 > \\sim -0.9 $ ] .",
    "figure 4 shows [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] for a z=2 satellite for the new run with stronger feedback ( top panel ) , and for the mw1 used in this paper ( bottom panel ) .",
    "we have chosen to look at z=2 satellites because @xmath58 of accreted stars which end up in our halo sample ( see figure 2 ) formed before this time in such satellites .",
    "the total mass of both satellites is @xmath59 , but the stellar mass of the new satellite is @xmath60 , and of the old satellite is @xmath61 .",
    "both satellites exhibit the characteristic turn - over to lower [ o / fe ] .",
    "the new run with the less luminous satellite population simply exhibits this turn - over at a lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "the in situ stars of each galaxy are shown in red triangles .",
    "both simulations show that in situ stars are more alpha - rich at the high [ fe / h ] end than the satellite stars .",
    "the distinct [ @xmath0/fe ] trends of the two halo populations is a result of their formation in potential wells whose depths vary by more than an order of magnitude",
    ". the trends do not depend on the details of the simulations mdf .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the chemical abundance trends of inner halo stars in four sph+n - body simulations of approximately l * disk galaxies .",
    "we investigate the possibility of using chemical abundance trends to discern the relative importance of in situ and accretion processes in building up the inner stellar halos of milky way - mass galaxies . for each simulated galaxy we concentrated on a sample of halo stars located within 10 kpc of a simulated sun - like observer .",
    "this sample included stars from two populations , one formed in situ , and one accreted .",
    "we find that in the inner halos of galaxies where a recent binary merger did not occur , high [ fe / h ] in situ halo stars are more [ @xmath0/fe ] rich than accreted stars at similar [ fe / h ] .",
    "the bimodal distribution of [ @xmath0/fe ] at high [ fe / h ] for in situ and accreted stars is primarily due to the different mass galaxies in which they formed .",
    "the in situ halo populations ( in all but h258 ) were formed early on deep in the potential wells of the primary dark matter halos , where a high star formation rate ensured that only core - collapse sne dominated the chemical enrichment up to high [ fe / h ] .",
    "the accreted stars , which formed later on average than the in situ stars , and in shallower potential wells , underwent a slower chemical evolution , where sne type ia contributed iron at lower [ fe / h ] , resulting in a lower [ @xmath0/fe ] at a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "such trends are expected given a mass - metallicity relation @xcite .",
    "though the satellite galaxies in our simulations are too bright , and hence too metal rich , we have found that the relative chemical abundance patterns between in situ and accreted stars is a qualitative trend that is robust to the details of the simulated halos mdfs .",
    "we predict that a large systematic survey of the detailed chemical abundances of inner halo stars in the milky way will exhibit such dual trends in [ fe / h ] vs [ @xmath0/fe ] . at higher metallicities , [ fe / h]@xmath62 , milky way stars in the inner several kpc of the halo should exhibit a bimodal distribution in [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "unless the galaxy has experienced a recent major major , high [ @xmath0/fe ] stars in this metallicity range will have formed in the milky way s disk or bulge , and then been displaced into halo orbits .",
    "low [ @xmath0/fe ] stars in this regime will likely have formed in smaller potential wells than the milky way , and were accreted from satellite companions at high redshift .",
    "in fact , such trends in @xmath0 and fe have already been observed in a small sample of 94 local milky way halo dwarfs @xcite .",
    "larger planned surveys , like hermes , which will obtain high resolution spectra of mw halo stars will be able to observe such patterns , and quantify the importance of different physical processes to the mw s halo formation .",
