    "the study of atmospheric neutrinos of sub - gev and multi - gev energies has been of paramount importance in the recent past , providing in particular the first clear evidence in favor of neutrino oscillations , and hence of non - vanishing neutrino masses .",
    "these neutrinos are produced mainly in the decay of pions and kaons ( e.g. @xmath2 , with @xmath3 ) produced by the cosmic rays ( crs ) hitting the upper atmosphere and generating air showers with a significant hadronic component . due to the interplay between the mesons decay and their interactions in the air ,",
    "as the energy increases ( with the associated relativistic dilation of their decay times ) the mesons lose an increasing amount of energy before they decay , and also the muons produced can reach the ground before decaying . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the predicted atmospheric neutrino spectrum results steeper than the cr spectrum typically by an extra power of the energy , with d@xmath4 , while d@xmath5 @xcite .    comparing the charged mesons decay length , @xmath6 , where in particular @xmath7  km(@xmath8  gev ) and @xmath9  km(@xmath10 ) , it is clear that above 100  gev the pions traverse several attenuation lengths ( corresponding to approximately 120  g/@xmath11 ) in the atmosphere before decaying , and due to this the neutrino fluxes above a few hundred gevs actually arise mainly from @xmath12 decays . kaons in turn are also significantly attenuated before decaying for energies above the tev , with the effect that the prompt neutrinos from charmed particle decays become increasingly important .    several groups have studied the charm particle production by crs @xcite , which actually requires to take into account next to leading order ( nlo ) processes , which increase the charm production by more than a factor of two , and the cross sections are sensitive to the values of the partonic distribution functions at very small values of the scaling variable @xmath13 , what introduces further uncertainties in the results , due to the need to extrapolate beyond the measured range . even if the charmed mesons ( @xmath14 ) are produced at a rate @xmath15 with respect to the non - charmed ones , their very short decay time , with @xmath16  km(@xmath17  pev ) , implies that the prompt neutrino spectral slope just follows the cr slope , and hence the prompt neutrinos eventually dominate the atmospheric neutrino fluxes above a pev in the vertical direction , and somewhat above that energy at large zenith angles .",
    "it is important at this point to take into account the fact that the primary cr spectrum shows a steepening at the so - called _ knee _ , corresponding to @xmath18  ev , with d@xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "the associated steepening in the induced neutrino fluxes has been obtained in the literature @xcite , but these works usually assume for simplicity that the dominant cr component consists of protons , and only some crude attempts have been done trying to generalise these predictions to heavier compositions @xcite .",
    "another contribution to the diffuse neutrino fluxes produced by crs are those resulting from the interactions of the crs present all over the galaxy with the ambient gas in the inter stellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the very low densities in the ism ( @xmath21 ) imply that essentially all mesons produced decay in this case without suffering any attenuation , and hence the neutrino fluxes are just the conventional ones from @xmath22 , @xmath12 and @xmath23 decays , and moreover their spectral slopes follow the behaviour of the primary cr spectrum .",
    "these neutrino fluxes are proportional to the column density of the ism along the particular direction considered , and hence the flux is maximal in the direction to the galactic center , it is generally enhanced near the galactic plane while it is minimum in the direction orthogonal to it .",
    "along directions near the plane of the milky way , these diffuse fluxes of galactic neutrinos may overcome the atmospheric neutrino background at energies larger than @xmath24  ev ( the actual energy depends on the model adopted for charm production and on the assumed ism column density , see below ) , but in the direction orthogonal to the plane they remain below the expected flux from prompt atmospheric neutrinos from charmed particle decays up to the highest energies @xcite . here",
    "again the usual simplifying working hypothesis is that the cr flux consists mainly of protons , and only crude attempts have been done trying to generalise the predictions to heavier compositions @xcite .",
    "although some works have found a strong sensitivity to the assumed composition both for atmospheric and galactic cr induced neutrinos , this issue is generally not treated appropriately and hence a more thorough analysis is required in order to estimate the neutrino fluxes with some confidence for @xmath1  ev .",
    "the very high energy neutrino fluxes produced by crs both in the atmosphere and in the galaxy are one of the important targets of present and future neutrino telescopes , such as amanda , baikal , antares , icecube , etc .. they are interesting per se , but they also represent the main background in the search of the fluxes arising from other potential neutrino sources , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , which might give rise to detectable fluxes just in the energy range @xmath25@xmath26  ev @xcite .",
    "it is hence of primary importance to establish with some confidence the actual value of the cr induced neutrino fluxes , and the aim of the present work is to point out that the predictions are quite sensitive to the detailed composition and to the behaviour of the spectrum of the individual nuclear components of the crs with energies above those corresponding to the knee in the spectrum .",
    "a major problem that one has to face here is that although the existence of the knee has been known for more than forty years , there is still no consensus on the underlying physics responsible for this feature , and different proposed explanations for it can lead to quite different predictions for the behaviour of the cr composition and the individual spectra . on the observational side , due to the indirect nature of the measurements , which are based on the analysis of extensive air showers ,",
    "also the situation is far from settled .    a large class of possible scenarios to explain the knee",
    "are based on a rigidity dependent effect , such as a change on the cr acceleration efficiency at the sources @xcite or on a change in the escape mechanism of crs from the galaxy @xcite , both of which , being magnetic effects , depend on the ratio @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cr charge .",
    "hence , in these scenarios the different nuclear components essentially steepen their spectra at an energy @xmath29 , and in this way the light components become more suppressed at smaller energies than the heavy ones .",
    "this leads to the prediction that the cr composition should become increasingly heavier above @xmath30 , in agreement with the latest observations of kascade @xcite and the eas - top / macro experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the change in the spectral slope of each individual component usually turns out to be steeper than the change in slope of the total observed spectrum , which is @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , in the so - called diffusion / drift model @xcite in which the knee is due to a change in the escape mechanism of crs from the galaxy from one dominated by normal diffusion ( with diffusion coefficient @xmath32 ) to one dominated by drift effects ( with @xmath33 ) , the spectral slope of each individual nuclear component changes by an amount @xmath34 .    as we will show below , these rigidity dependent scenarios have a profound impact on the predictions of high energy diffuse neutrino fluxes , and hence a clear understanding of the physics responsible for the knee and also better measurements of air showers at these energies are crucial to predict the expected neutrino fluxes and to extract conclusions from them once they will be measured .",
    "figure 1 shows the observed cosmic ray differential spectrum from several experiments @xcite . as mentioned above , the total cr spectrum is well described by power laws d@xmath35 , with the spectral index changing from @xmath36 to @xmath37 at the so - called knee , occurring at @xmath18  ev .",
    "the cr spectrum turns harder again at the ankle , corresponding to @xmath38  ev , a feature usually explained as the crossover between the dominance of the galactic cr component below the ankle and of the extragalactic one above it .",
    "a simple way of describing the galactic cr flux within a rigidity dependent scenario is to assume that each galactic component of charge @xmath28 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the cr flux below ( above ) the knee , and is given by @xmath42    .cosmic ray fractional abundances ( for @xmath43  tev ) and low energy spectral indices from hydrogen to nickel .",

    "( [ crfit1 ] ) provides then a smooth interpolation ) as @xmath51 , where the parameter @xmath52 will control the ` width ' of the knee , with @xmath53 leading to an abrupt change in slope .",
    "we find however that @xmath54 provides a very satisfactory fit to the cr data for the @xmath55 case considered .",
    "] between the flux @xmath40 at low energies @xmath56 and @xmath41 at high energies @xmath57",
    ".    = 5.truein=3.5truein    the cr abundances at @xmath43  tev and the low - energy spectral indices are shown in table 1 , and were taken from the data compiled in @xcite .    for the extragalactic component , we will assume for definiteness that it consists of protons ( this would anyhow only affect the predictions for @xmath58  ev ) and that it is given by @xmath59 i.e. a flux similar to that considered in @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of illustration , we display in figure 1 the cases of both @xmath55 , corresponding to the diffusion / drift model ( when a kolmogorov spectrum of fluctuations is assumed for the random magnetic field component in which cr particles propagate @xcite ) , and @xmath60 , corresponding to an extreme model advocated in @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the fits that result from taking @xmath55 with the parameter value @xmath61ev , and @xmath60 with @xmath62ev .",
    "while the former exhibits an excellent agreement with the experimental observations , it can be seen that the latter shows an abrupt suppression above @xmath63  ev which results from the steep suppression of the different cr components above their knees @xcite , and due to this we will hereafter just focus on the @xmath55 case .",
    "the cr particles reaching the top of the atmosphere produce secondary fluxes of hadrons and leptons that are usually described by means of coupled cascade equations @xcite , which can be solved analytically under appropriate symplifying assumptions . in this work",
    "we will compute the fluxes of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos , which are the ones more readily detectable at underground detectors . at the energies considered the neutrino flavor oscillations will have no effect on the atmospheric neutrinos , although they may be relevant for the neutrinos produced by cr interactions with the ism ( eventually redistributing in that case the produced @xmath64 and @xmath65 fluxes evenly among the three flavors , something that can be incorporated into the final results straightforwardly ) .",
    "the main contributions to the neutrino flux in the range of interest of this work ( namely , for @xmath66  gev ) arise , on the one hand , from the decay of the mesons @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which produce the so called conventional atmospheric neutrinos that dominate at low energies , and on the other hand , from the decay of the charmed mesons @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which give rise to the so called prompt charm neutrino flux that dominates at very high energies .",
    "the muon contribution to the atmospheric neutrino flux is completely negligible in this context , since above @xmath71 gev the muons reach the ground and are stopped before decaying .",
    "the transport equation associated to a given cascade component @xmath72 can be written as @xmath73 where as usual @xmath74 is the slant depth , @xmath75 is the interaction length in air and @xmath76 is the decay length .",
    "both characteristic lengths are measured in g/@xmath11 units ( i.e. they include the factor @xmath77 that corresponds to the local density of the atmosphere ) . also notice that the decay length is linear in the energy due to the lorentz time dilation factor , while the interaction length exhibits instead a much milder energy dependence . the last term in equation ( [ casc ] )",
    "corresponds to the production / regeneration term given by @xmath78 which actually couples the transport equations of different cascade components .",
    "notice that @xmath79 here refers to the total @xmath80air cross section , while @xmath81 corresponds to the process @xmath80air",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83 anything .",
    "since the energies involved in the nuclear collisions between crs and atmospheric nuclei are much higher than nuclear binding energies , only nucleon - nucleon interactions are relevant in this context .",
    "the different cascade components that we will take into account are hence @xmath84 ( that corresponds to the nucleon component in which protons and neutrons are grouped together ) and @xmath85 and @xmath70 . as in @xcite , the @xmath86 can be considered as contributing to the pion flux .",
    "moreover , we will assume for simplicity that the only non - negligible terms will be those corresponding to regeneration ( i.e. @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and to meson production by nucleons ( i.e. @xmath89 ) @xcite .",
    "let us consider in particular fluxes with the form @xmath90 ( i.e. we consider the separation of variables in the fluxes , in which the energy dependent factor has a power - law behavior ) .",
    "then , it turns out that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the production / regeneration moment defined by @xmath93 with @xmath94 .    assuming that the interaction lengths are energy independent and that the differential production distribution is feynman scaling , the production / regeneration moments themselves become energy independent . indeed , for the relevant interaction lengths and production / regeneration moments involving nucleons and non - charmed mesons",
    ", we consider the energy independent values given in @xcite . when necessary , we also take the @xmath95dependence from fits to the data compiled and plotted in @xcite .",
    "moreover , following @xcite , the charm interaction lengths and regeneration moments are all set equal to the kaon ones .    for the production of charmed particles , however , one has to take into account the energy dependent moment given by equation ( [ zmoment ] ) , since the results are very sensitive to the particular cross section adopted for the charm production process .",
    "indeed , the various estimates of the prompt atmospheric fluxes calculated so far are found to differ by almost 2 orders of magnitude @xcite .    due to their relatively large mass , charm quarks",
    "are usually considered to be produced in hard processes which can be well described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) . to leading order ( lo ) in the coupling constant , the processes that contribute to the charm production cross section are the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath96 and the quark - antiquark annihilation process @xmath97 . however , at the next to leading order ( nlo ) the gluon scattering process @xmath98 shows up , giving a very significant contribution to the total cross section which increases it by a factor of @xmath99 @xcite . concerning higher order corrections , their contribution is certainly small since there are no qualitatively new channels opening up .",
    "several parton distribution functions have been proposed and provide theoretical pqcd predictions that fit the available accelerator data reasonably well . however , in order to calculate the atmospheric charm flux the parton distribution functions need to be extrapolated to very small parton momentum fractions , typically corresponding to @xmath100  gev/@xmath101 @xcite , which at the highest energies is well outside of the measured region ( @xmath102 , and the uncertainty in the extrapolation affects significantly the final results @xcite . in order to illustrate this uncertainty range , we display the results obtained with two different structure distribution functions , namely the cteq3 parton distribution function @xcite and the golec - biernat , wsthoff ( gbw ) model @xcite , which includes gluon saturation effects .",
    "the corresponding charm production cross sections were obtained either directly from the fit given in @xcite ( for the results based on the gbw saturation model ) , or by fitting the results given in figure  4 of @xcite for the cteq3 structure functions set with @xmath103 , with the charm mass @xmath104  gev , and interpolating the results for different energies . for the nucleon - air cross section",
    ", we used the parametrization given by @xcite @xmath105{\\rm{mb}}\\ .",

    "recalling that these expressions were obtained under the assumption of power - law nucleon and meson spectra , we will first discuss the results for an initial nucleon flux given according to @xmath106 , discussing the general case further below .    under the assumptions mentioned above",
    ", the nucleon flux develops independently from the meson fluxes and is given by @xmath107 where the nucleon attenuation length is defined as @xmath108    concerning the meson cascade equations , they are usually solved by considering separately the low energy solution @xmath109 ( which neglects the interaction and regeneration terms , since @xmath110 at low energies ) and the high energy solution @xmath111 ( which neglects instead the decay term , since @xmath112 at very high energies ) @xcite .",
    "the high energy solution is given by @xmath113 where the meson attenuation length @xmath114 is defined analogously to equation ( [ lambdan ] ) .",
    "for the low energy case , the solution is obtained by replacing @xmath115 in the last equation . recalling that @xmath116 , the resulting expression couples the dependence on the energy and the slant depth , and hence it does not lead to just a simple power law energy spectrum . however",
    ", for not very small values of @xmath74 the solution reduces to @xmath117    in equations ( [ nucleons])([mesonsl ] ) , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are to be evaluated for the nucleon spectral index @xmath120 .",
    "notice also that the high energy meson flux has the same spectral index as the nucleon flux , while the low energy meson solution is flatter by an extra power of the energy , due to the energy dependence implicit in @xmath121 .",
    "the neutrino flux produced via the meson weak decay can be calculated following the same scheme described above for the atmospheric nucleon and meson fluxes .",
    "indeed , the neutrino flux is given by a transport equation analogous to equation ( [ casc ] ) , but actually much simpler since it contains only the source terms arising from meson decay , i.e. @xmath122 where @xmath123 the decay distribution can be put in terms of @xmath124 , the inclusive neutrino spectrum in the decay of meson @xmath125 , by means of the relation @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the branching ratio for the decay of meson @xmath125 into a state with the given neutrino @xmath128 . in the ultrarelativistic limit ,",
    "the inclusive neutrino spectrum scales as @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have already derived the asymptotic solutions for the meson fluxes , which are of the form @xmath130 , with @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) for the high ( low ) energy fluxes ( see equations ( [ mesonsh ] ) and ( [ mesonsl ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the source terms given by equation ( [ nuflux2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath133 where the @xmath134dependent meson decay moments are defined by @xmath135 the decay moments used in this work were calculated by fitting the @xmath134 dependence of the relevant moments tabulated in @xcite for @xmath136 , which were determined with lund monte carlo simulation programs .",
    "then , the asymptotic low and high energy neutrino fluxes can now be determined from the equations ( [ nuflux1 ] ) and ( [ nuflux3 ] ) , which involve the meson decay moments and the corresponding high and low energy meson fluxes derived in equations ( [ mesonsh ] ) and ( [ mesonsl ] ) .",
    "the low energy solution reads @xmath137 as expected , the neutrino flux develops rapidly , on the scale of a nucleon interaction length , and then remains stable . hence , at ground level ( @xmath138 ) the low energy flux will be @xmath139 similarly , the high energy flux at ground is @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the zenith angle of the cr incidence direction considered and @xmath142 with @xmath143 and @xmath144 the meson s mass and mean life , respectively , and @xmath145  km a typical scale height for density variations in the atmosphere . since the production / regeneration moments @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the same as those appearing in the meson fluxes , they are to be evaluated for the nucleon spectral index @xmath120 .",
    "equation ( [ atmosh ] ) is actually valid for zenith angles sufficiently small so that the curvature of the earth can be neglected , and assumes a density profile of an isothermal atmosphere ( i.e. @xmath146 ) , which is appropriate in the stratosphere ( @xmath147  km ) where most particle interactions occur @xcite .",
    "for very large angles , one can still use equation ( [ atmosh ] ) with the simple prescription of replacing @xmath148  km ) , where for a given line of sight that corresponds to an angle @xmath141 at the observer s position , the angle @xmath149 is the zenith angle that would be observed at a location where this same line of sight is at a height @xmath150 with respect to the ground @xcite .",
    "for instance , for crs incident in the horizontal direction ( @xmath151 ) , one has that @xmath152 .    in order to obtain a general expression for the atmospheric neutrino fluxes deep in the atmosphere",
    ", the asymptotic solutions given by equations ( [ atmosl2 ] ) and ( [ atmosh ] ) can be joined together by means of the interpolation function @xmath153 which is actually analogous to the interpolation function given in equation ( [ crfit1 ] ) to join the fluxes associated to each galactic cr component below and above their knees .",
    "we described so far a calculational scheme that provides the nucleon , meson and neutrino fluxes produced by an initial power law nucleon flux @xmath106 hitting the top of the atmosphere . we now seek the corresponding results for the full cr spectrum arriving at the earth , taking into account both the cr composition and the break in the cr spectra at the knee .",
    "let @xmath154 be the cr flux associated to the cr component of nuclei of charge @xmath28 and mass @xmath155 ( with @xmath156 being the average mass number corresponding to element @xmath28 ) .",
    "this nuclear component provides a nucleon flux @xmath157 given by @xmath158 .",
    "if the flux of the cr component of charge @xmath28 is @xmath159 , the corresponding nucleon flux is then given by @xmath160 > from these considerations , the procedure to calculate the neutrino flux produced by the galactic cr flux parametrized by equations ( [ crfit1 ] ) and ( [ crfit2 ] ) is now straightforward .",
    "indeed , the cr component of charge @xmath28 is represented by two power law fluxes @xmath161 and @xmath162 , with spectral indices @xmath48 and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "for each power law flux , we can compute the corresponding nucleon flux given by equation ( [ crnucleon ] ) and use it to calculate the associated neutrino flux .",
    "then , the final neutrino flux produced by the given cr component can be obtained by interpolating the two solutions , using again the interpolation function analogous to equation  ( [ crfit1 ] ) . finally , the total neutrino flux results from summing over the contribution of all galactic cr components together with the additional contribution from the extragalactic component given by equation  ( [ xgflux ] ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the atmospheric neutrino fluxes that correspond to the @xmath55 rigidity dependent scenario , with the parametrization formulae and parameter values given in section 2 .",
    "the figure shows the contribution coming from different components and for different cases , namely the vertical and horizontal conventional , prompt charm / gbw and prompt charm / cteq3 fluxes . for the prompt charm flux calculated with the gbw model",
    ", the figure also shows the total vertical and horizontal neutrino fluxes .",
    "finally , in the latter case the conventional , charm and total neutrino fluxes produced by the extragalactic cr component is also indicated .",
    "= 4.7truein=3.2truein    as is clear from equation ( [ crnucleon ] ) , the induced neutrino fluxes are sensitive , on the one hand , to the cr composition assumed and , on the other hand , to the model assumed to reproduce the steepening of the cr spectrum at the knee .",
    "previous works that have taken the knee into account have assumed for simplicity that the dominant cr component consists of protons alone , having a spectral change @xmath164 at @xmath30 . in order to observe the effect of the cr composition on the neutrino fluxes ,",
    "figure 3 compares the total horizontal atmospheric fluxes ( with the prompt charm component calculated with the gbw model ) as obtained for different assumptions on the cr spectrum , namely the @xmath55 rigidity dependent scenario ( that corresponds to the results given already in figure 2 ) , the same total cr spectrum but assuming it consists only of protons , and the cr spectrum used in @xcite ( which is assumed to be constituted by protons and has a single spectral index change of @xmath164 at @xmath165ev ) .",
    "the latter cr spectrum has a normalization which is lower by a factor of @xmath166 compared to the former ones , and indeed it seems to lay somewhat below the present observational data . comparing the results for the same total cr spectrum",
    ", one can observe that the neutrino flux corresponding to the composition of different nuclear species is clearly below that produced by a cr spectrum formed only by protons , and also that this effect is more significant at higher energies . indeed , equation ( [ crnucleon ] ) shows that the nuclear cr component of charge @xmath28 and mass @xmath156 gives a contribution to the nucleon flux which is suppressed by a factor of @xmath167 below the respective knee , while it becomes suppressed by a factor @xmath168 well above it .",
    "this effect was not appropriately treated in @xcite , where the suppression was considered to be given by a factor of @xmath169 , and moreover the impact of the change in the composition at the knee was never discussed before .",
    "the strong suppression of the @xmath128 flux produced by the heavier components implies that the light ( h and he ) components are still responsible for a large fraction of the neutrinos above their knee , and hence the change in slope of the individual components is also reflected in the change in slope of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "the neutrino fluxes produced during the propagation of the cr particles through the ism can be determined following the procedure described in the preceding section for the production of atmospheric neutrinos . for simplicity , we consider that the crs are distributed homogeneously within the galactic disk .",

    "the treatment follows essentially the same considerations described above , but in this case one has to consider that the interaction of the secondaries produced in the nucleon - nucleon interactions is completely negligible due to the extremely low ism densities , which allow for their decay well before interactions can take place , irrespective of the energy considered .",
    "hence , the main contributions to the diffuse neutrino flux produced in the galaxy arise from the decay of pions and muons , while the additional contributions coming from production and decay of heavier mesons can be safely disregarded .    as in the preceding section ,",
    "let us first consider an initial nucleon flux given by @xmath106 .",
    "notice that in this context the atmospheric slant depth should be replaced by the ism column density traversed along the line of sight ( i.e. @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is the distance measured from the border of the galactic disk along the line of sight ) .",

    "hence , considering equation ( [ atmosl1 ] ) with @xmath173 , the neutrino flux produced from pion decay in the ism is @xmath177    in order to determine the muon decay contribution , it suffices to estimate it directly from the results obtained already for pion decay . from the decay kinematics , the mean fraction of energy ( relative to the parent particle ) in the @xmath178 decay",

    "= 4.1truein=2.6truein    = 4.1truein=2.6truein    as commented above , the galactic neutrino flavor oscillations may redistribute the produced @xmath65 and @xmath64 fluxes evenly among the three flavors . in that case",
    ", the calculation of the electron neutrino flux produced by cr interactions with the ism is also required in order to determine the galactic muon neutrino flux reaching the earth .",
    "this flux is mainly produced in the @xmath180 decay , in which the effective fraction of energy for the @xmath64 is 0.3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath64 flux is approximately a factor @xmath185 times the @xmath65 flux produced in the muon decay ( i.e. a factor of @xmath186 for a nucleon spectral index @xmath184 , again in good agreement with previous , more detailed calculations @xcite ) .",
    "hence , if the neutrino flavors are redistributed by oscillations , the ( @xmath187 ) galactic flux will be a factor @xmath188 of that depicted in figure  4 , which neglects the neutrino oscillations .    in order to calculate the galactic neutrino flux induced by the full cr spectrum",

    "the total galactic neutrino fluxes are shown in figure 4(a ) for @xmath189 and 20 kpc , and correspond to the @xmath55 rigidity dependent scenario ( with the same parametrization used for the previous figures and detailed in section 2 ) .",
    "for comparison , the figure also shows the total atmospheric neutrino flux in the horizontal direction with the prompt charm component calculated using the gbw model , as well as the waxman - bahcall flux predictions for the astrophysical diffuse neutrino fluxes produced in their model of grbs @xcite .",

    ", we observe that the galactic flux in the direction orthogonal to the plane ( corresponding for instance to @xmath189  kpc ) remains below the atmospheric flux up to the highest energies . along directions near the galactic plane ( e.g. for @xmath190  kpc )",
    ", the flux of galactic neutrinos produced in the ism instead overcomes the atmospheric flux at energies larger than @xmath24  ev . the energy at which the galactic flux actually dominates depends to a large extent on the particular model adopted for charm production , as discussed above , and the results naturally also vary according to the assumed ism column density and the zenith angle of arrival direction in the atmosphere .",
    "these figures show very clearly the significant effect of suppression in the neutrino fluxes that results from considering a rigidity dependent scenario .",
    "indeed , above @xmath191  ev the waxman - bahcall flux is found to overcome the background of galactic neutrinos with trajectories nearly contained in the galactic plane .",
    "however , if the same total cr spectrum is taken to be formed by protons alone , the resulting background flux of galactic neutrinos turns out to be larger than the waxman - bahcall flux up to @xmath192  ev , and then both fluxes stay with comparable magnitude up to the highest energies .",
    "hence , rigidity dependent scenarios result in a significantly reduced background for the search of astrophysical neutrino sources of current interest , such as for instance grbs or agns .",
    "we computed in this work the high energy diffuse fluxes of muon neutrinos ( and antineutrinos ) produced by crs hitting the upper atmosphere or interacting with the ism in the galaxy , showing that the results are quite sensitive to both the total cr spectrum and the cr composition assumed . concerning the former , we compared previous results ( which adopted an overall normalization for the cr spectrum actually somewhat below present observational data , and a single and abrupt slope change representing the knee ) with those obtained from considering a smooth cr spectrum that soundly fits the observations and reproduces its main relevant features ( namely , the knee , the second knee and the ankle ) . with respect to the latter , we showed that taking into account a cr composition that turns heavier above the knee ( i.e. in agreement with the scenarios that explain the knee as due to a rigidity dependent effect ) the induced neutrino fluxes become significantly suppressed , thus making their detection harder but also reducing the background for the search of other astrophysical neutrino sources . in particular , we compared our results with the waxman - bahcall predictions for the neutrino fluxes produced in their model of grbs , and found indeed that the signal - to - background ratio for this model becomes significantly enhanced when considering a cr composition with the contribution of different nuclear species , as opposed to the case in which the full cr spectrum is assumed to be composed of protons alone . an analogous effect would lower the neutrino flux produced by the extragalactic component ( which gives the dominant contribution to the total neutrino flux above @xmath193  ev ) if it were not constituted just by protons , as we assumed here .",
    "it is then clear that if the diffuse neutrino fluxes predicted in the grbs models @xcite or the even larger ones associated to some agn models @xcite do actually exist , the observation of atmospheric or galactic cr induced neutrino fluxes above @xmath25  ev will remain probably hopeless .",
    "let us also mention that it may be of interest to consider the atmospheric muon fluxes produced by crs .",
    "for instance , it has recently been suggested @xcite that the observation of the down - going atmospheric muons with neutrino telescopes would provide an indirect measure of the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux , and hence this could be used to confront the nlo qcd predictions .",
    "indeed , due to the charmed particle semileptonic decay kinematics , it turns out that the prompt muon flux coincides with the prompt neutrino flux to within @xmath194 , irrespective of the energy and independently of the model used to treat the atmospheric charm production @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the atmospheric conventional muon flux is about a factor of @xmath195 larger than the conventional muon neutrino flux within the energy range of interest of this work , and exhibits roughly the same energy dependence @xcite .",
    "completely analogous effects as those described here for the neutrino fluxes should then be expected for the atmospheric muons produced by crs reaching the earth .",
    "finally , we stress the key importance of determining confidently the cr composition around and above the knee , since it appears in this context as decisive in order to estimate reliably the diffuse high energy neutrino background produced by crs .",
    "moreover , solving the cr composition puzzle will also provide a valuable means of testing the different proposals concerning the origin and nature of the knee , and will thus shed new light on this long standing problem .",
