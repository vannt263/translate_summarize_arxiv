    "they are expressed in @xmath16 , which is an expansion around the nuclear saturation density @xmath17 at which the pressure of nuclear matter is zero .    when the eos is expanded as eq.([eos ] ) , there appear characteristic parameters : the binding energy per nucleon @xmath18 , the incompressibility of sm @xmath4 , the skewness parameter of sm @xmath19 , the symmetry energy @xmath20 , the slope parameter @xmath21 and the symmetry incompressibility @xmath11 , and so on .",

    "we have performed a systematic investigation of the isgmr to extract the isospin dependent compression eos parameter from finite nuclear system , using the linear response calculation with cb - tdhfb represented in 3d coordinate space .",
    "the expansion coefficients ( @xmath31 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 ) of finite incompressibility @xmath7 are determined from @xmath1=@xmath2 and isobar @xmath3=100 , 132 nuclide for each skyrme interaction ( sgii , skm@xmath0 , sly4 , skt3 , ski3 ) .",
    "furthermore in sn isotopes ( @xmath3=100@xmath34132 ) , it is confirmed that the coefficients are suitable and the @xmath7 expansion is available .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath31 are lager than those of @xmath4 , thus the analysis assuming @xmath31=@xmath122 is not effective , which are often used in previous study for non - relativistic interaction .",
    "the @xmath6 estimation eq.([kci ] ) works well .",
    "the isospin term @xmath8 in the finite system is smaller than the @xmath10 .",
    "the magicity in a present work does not affect the conclusion . and",
    "the pairing effect in sn isotopes are not so large , although the deformation due to the lack of pairing causes the coupling quadrupole and monopole modes , and disturbs the position of gmr .",
    "we narrow down the values from the comparison experimental data with our results in a whole mass region , which indicates the range of @xmath8 is -305@xmath910 mev .",
    "the incompressibility parameters corresponding to the range have @xmath4=225@xmath911 and @xmath11=-138@xmath918 mev , which is consistent with the previous study of slop parameter @xmath21 @xcite . as an indication of eq.([kti ] ) , the @xmath21 has an important role to decide @xmath11 . thus the studies related to @xmath21 should be also pressed forward in parallel .",
    "the ordinary mass scaling of gmr has underestimation in heavy mass system , which may indicate the needs to reconsider the expression of incompressibility .    to determine the isospin term @xmath8 , the systematic isgmr data in isobar nuclide are very effective",
    ". they should be heavy system over @xmath3=100 at least , because in light system the nuclear speciality is showing up . when the heavy nucleus is used to analyse gmr",
    ", we should note the deformation of open shell nuclei . if the monopole and other modes in deformed nucleus can be separated , the analysis data increases and the relation eos parameter and finite system will be more robust .",
