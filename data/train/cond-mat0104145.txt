    "as the relaxation rate @xmath16 ( in the absence of fluctuations ) is independent of the site interspacing , the incoherent scattering correlation function @xmath63 , given in eq.([acjump ] ) , is equal to @xmath63 in the absence of fluctuations times @xmath5 .    for the diffusion inside a fluctuating sphere , on the other hand , eq.([aofq ] ) reduces to @xmath143 where @xmath144 , given in eq.([fq ] ) , is the scattered amplitude for diffusion inside a sphere of fixed radius @xmath1 and the average is taken over the distribution of radii .",
    "however , the normalized elastic intensity @xmath96 , given by eq.([iq1 ] ) , involves two contributions depending on the relaxation of the sphere radius over time scales @xmath92 . when the particle diffusion is slow compare to the fluctuations of the sphere , @xmath96 is equal to @xmath143 while , in the opposite limit , it is is given by @xmath145 . since the relaxation time @xmath146 for the diffusion in a sphere",
    "depend on the sphere radius , the fluctuations of the sphere radius generate an effective distribution of relaxation time so that @xmath0 , in eq.([cqts ] ) , is @xmath147 , where the average is taken over the @xmath3-dependent effective distribution of relaxation times and @xmath5 is the correlation function of the sphere radius .",
    "it worthwhile to mention that when @xmath6 , the situation resembles to what is known as the heterogeneous scenario for the explanation of the stretched exponential or kohlrausch - williams - watts relaxation @xcite .",
    "such a situation may be encountered in the case where the particle atoms in a protein system undergo jump dynamics between sites ( or diffusion inside spherical cages ) each of them with different site interspacing ( radius ) , i.e. polydispersity in length scales . in this case , @xmath0 is exponential for jump dynamics between sites ( provided that @xmath16 is the same for each particle ) while it is nonexponential for diffusion inside a sphere .",
    "the above results with @xmath121 are derived in the homogeneous scenario @xcite which assumes that all particles are dynamically identical .    to conclude",
    ", we emphasize that the dynamics of particle atoms in a protein system is a multidimensional problem in which the particles and constituent elements of their environment undergo their own dynamics in respective potentials .",
    "the speculative discussion outlined above is a quite simplified two - dimensional version ( particle position @xmath34 and site interspacing or sphere radius @xmath1 ) of the problem .",
    "nonetheless , it is encouraging to see that the present analysis indicate that the form of the scattering intensity , for instance , is quite influenced by the fluctuations .",
    "this suggests at least to reconsider the way of fitting experimental data and revise the interpretation of parameters as determined . in the same spirit",
    ", an analysis combining particle dynamics and fluctuations in both the size and shape of the confining geometries can be developed along these lines ."
