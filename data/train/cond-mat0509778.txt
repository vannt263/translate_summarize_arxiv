    "heavy fermion materials  @xcite are metallic alloys of actinide or rare - earth elements ( typically u or ce ) . at high temperature ,",
    "their chemically active valence electrons are confined in localized @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "these @xmath0-electrons constitute a dense lattice of localized spins embedded in  and only weakly interacting with  the ordinary conduction sea . at low temperature ,",
    "the @xmath0-electron moments become strongly coupled to the conduction electrons and , indirectly , to each other . below the characteristic kondo temperature ,",
    "a complicated many - body state emerges in which the local moments are screened ( provided that the kondo physics overwhelms the competing rkky interaction  @xcite ) .",
    "this state exhibits unconventional metallic behaviour with an effective mass tens or hundreds of times larger than that of a bare band electron .",
    "the key detail is that the broad band of conduction electrons is intersected by a nearly dispersionless , highly correlated , @xmath0-electron band .",
    "the heavy fermion ground state can be understood to be a `` nearly - broken symmetry '' state  @xcite in which the overlap between excitations in the two bands becomes macroscopically important ( to order @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents the limit of large orbital degeneracy  @xcite ) .",
    "this motivates treating the kondo physics , in the guise of an interband hybridization , at the mean field level .",
    "when the hybridization order parameter condenses , the @xmath0-electrons are incorporated into an enlarged fermi sea of composite quasiparticles .",
    "mixing between the local and itinerant degrees of freedom causes the conduction band to break into upper and lower quasiparticle bands , leaving a region of shallow dispersion ( _ i.e. _ , large effective mass ) near the hybridization gap edge .",
    "the hybridization picture has been verified in real materials by a variety of experimental methods .",
    "infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy in particular has proved to be an important experimental probe : ir studies of ybfe@xmath3sb@xmath4 and ceru@xmath3sb@xmath4 provided the first direct observation of the hybridization gap in heavy metals .",
    "@xcite in addition , the complex optical conductivity and the dielectric function , obtained from reflectance measurements by kramers - kronig , can be used to infer the effective mass .",
    "such an analysis is possible because the electrodynamic response of the system depends on the mass enhancement factor in a known way .",
    "@xcite    in a recent experiment , dordevic _",
    "et al_.  carried out a detailed ir study of the heavy fermion material ceru@xmath3sb@xmath4 in high magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite a complete theory of the electrodynamic response was lacking in this case . here , the applied field breaks the spin degeneracy of the fermi sea , with the result that spin up and spin down quasiparticles have different effective masses .",
    "the reflectance , however , is insensitive to the quasiparticle spin .",
    "thus , the measured optical conductivity , insofar as it depends on the ( now spin - dependent ) mass enhancement factor , represents an average over the two spin projections .    in this paper , we compute the mean field heavy fermion ground state in the presence of a zeeman field ( under the assumption that the field does not induce a magnetic instability  @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the effective mass is modified to linear order because of fermi surface splitting and to quadratic order because of magnetic suppression of the kondo singlet amplitude .",
    "as it turns out , the optical conductivity averages over the effective mass in such a way that corrections first appear at second order and with a _ negative _ coefficient ; the characteristic field scale is on the order of the kondo energy ( in magnetic units ) .",
    "such behaviour is observed experimentally in ref .  .",

    "@xcite ) it describes a band of free conduction electrons moving in a periodic array of magnetic impurities @xmath5 .",

    "the model can be extended to include a zeeman term , which consists of a magnetic field @xmath13 coupled to the total magnetic moment at each site : @xmath14    a useful formal trick is to represent the local spins in terms of fermions , which puts the local and itinerant degrees of freedom on the same footing .",
    "specifically , we take @xmath15 subject to the constraint @xmath16 . here , @xmath17 ( @xmath0 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of a fictitious , dispersionless @xmath0 band .",
    "the constraint suppresses all @xmath0-charge fluctuations and has the effect of projecting out the singlet states that are not a part of the hilbert space of the original su(2 ) spin .",

    "<S> a zeeman field affects the metallic heavy fermion ground state in two ways : ( _ i _ ) it splits the spin - degerenate conduction sea , leaving spin up and spin down fermi surfaces with different band curvature ; ( _ ii _ ) it competes with the kondo effect and thus suppresses the mass enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> taking these two effects into account , we compute the quasiparticle effective mass as a function of applied field strength within hybridization mean field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive an expression for the optical conductivity , which is relevant to infrared spectroscopy measurements . </S>"
