    "the degree sequence , also called graphic sequence , of a simple graph ( a graph without loop or parallel edges ) is the list of vertex degrees , usually written in nonincreasing order , as @xmath10 .",

    "the degree of a vertex @xmath20 is the number of hyperedges @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "an hypergraph @xmath14 is @xmath2-uniform if @xmath23 for all hyperedge @xmath21 .",
    "moreover @xmath24 has no parallel hyperedges , i.e. , @xmath25 for any pair @xmath18 of hyperedges .",
    "thus a simple graph ( loopless and without parallel edges ) is a @xmath26-uniform hypergraph .",
    "the problem of the characterization of the degree sequences of @xmath2-uniform hypergraphs is one of the most relevant among the unsolved problems in the theory of hypergraphs @xcite even for the case of @xmath27-uniform hypergraphs . for its last case kocay and li",

    "furthermore the complexity status of the reconstruction problem is still open .",
    "this problem has been related to a class of problems that are of great relevance in the field of discrete tomography .",
    "more precisely the aim of discrete tomography is the retrieval of geometrical information about a physical structure , regarded as a finite set of points in the integer lattice , from measurements , generically known as projections , of the number of atoms in the structure that lie on lines with fixed scopes .",
    "a common simplification is to represent a finite physical structure as a binary matrix , where an entry is @xmath28 or @xmath29 according to the presence or absence of an atom in the structure at the corresponding point of the lattice .",
    "one of the challenging problems in the field is then to reconstruct the structure , or , at least , to detect some of its geometrical properties from a small number of projections .",
    "one can refer to the books of g.t .",
    "herman and a. kuba @xcite for further information on the theory , algorithms and applications of this classical problem in discrete tomography .",
    "here we recall the seminal result in the field of the discrete tomography due to ryser  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be two nonnegative integral vectors , and @xmath32 be the class of binary matrices @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 in this context @xmath35 and @xmath8 are called the row , respectively column , projection of @xmath5 , as depicted in fig .",

    "some applications in discrete tomography requiring additional constraints can be found in @xcite .    as shown in @xcite",

    "numerous papers give some generalizations of this problem for the graphs with colored edges ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so , in this context , the problem of the characterization of the degree sequence @xmath42 of an @xmath2-uniform hypergraph @xmath3 ( without parallel edges ) asks whether there is a binary matrix @xmath43 with nonnegative projection vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 with distinct rows , i.e. , @xmath5 is the incidence matrix of @xmath3 where rows and columns correspond to hyperedges and vertices , respectively . to our knowledge",
    "the problem of the reconstruction of a binary matrix with distinct rows has not been studied in discrete tomography .    in this paper",
    ", we carry on our analysis in the special case where the @xmath2-uniform hypergraph to reconstruct is also @xmath4-regular , i.e. , each vertex @xmath44 has the same degree @xmath4 , in other words the vector of the vertical projection is homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "we also study the problem where the @xmath2-uniform hypergraph to reconstruct is almost @xmath4-regular , i.e. , @xmath46 , in other words the hypergraph has span one .",
    "we focus both on the decision problem , and on the related reconstruction problem , i.e. , the problem of determining the existence of an element of @xmath32 consistent with @xmath35 and @xmath8 , and in affirmative case , how to quickly reconstruct it . to accomplish these tasks",
    ", we will design an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the dimensions @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the matrix to reconstruct .",
    "the algorithm relies on the concepts of lyndon words and necklaces of fixed density , and uses an already known algorithm for their efficient generation .",

    "ryser gave a characterization of the instances of @xmath54 , with @xmath52 being the class of the binary matrices , that admit a positive answer .",

    "the cardinality of the related sets of solutions .",
    "ryser defined a well known greedy algorithm to solve @xmath60 that does not compare the obtained rows , and does not admit an easy generalization to perform this further task .    in the sequel",
    ", we are going to consider the class of binary matrices having no equal rows and homogeneous horizontal projections , due to its connections , as mentioned in the introduction , with the characterization of the degree sequences of @xmath2-uniform hypergraphs . among them , we restrict our analysis to those matrices that are also , first , @xmath4-regular , i.e. , whose vertical projections are also homogeneous : @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; we denote this class by @xmath63 ; and , second , almost @xmath4-regular , i.e. , whose vertical projections are also almost homogeneous : @xmath61 and @xmath64 ; we denote this class by @xmath65 . + now , we state a third necessary condition for answering to @xmath66 ( and",

    "we will prove that the three conditions 1,2 , and 3 are also sufficient to solve ( in linear time ) the problem @xmath70 .    to this aim",
    ", we use an approach different from those standardly used in discrete tomography : we consider each row of a matrix in @xmath63 as a binary word , and we group them into equivalence classes according to their cyclic shifts , as defined in the next section .",
    "let us consider each row of a binary matrix as a binary finite word @xmath71 , whose length @xmath48 is the number of columns of the matrix , and whose number @xmath2 of @xmath28-elements is the value of the horizontal projection .",
    "we note that applying a cyclic shift to the word @xmath72 , denoted by @xmath73 , we obtain a different word @xmath74 , unless the cases @xmath75 or @xmath76 , of the same length , and having the same number of @xmath28-elements inside . iterating the shift of a word @xmath72",
    ", we obtain a sequence of different words that row wise arranged as a matrix , belong to @xmath63 .",
    "we indicate with @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , the application of @xmath79 times the shift operator to the word @xmath72 .",
    "unfortunately the words repeat after at most @xmath48 shifts , and consequently the vertical projections of the obtained matrix are upper bounded by @xmath48 , so , in general , only a submatrix of a solution of @xmath80 is achieved ( see fig .",
    "[ matrix ] ) .",
    "the following trivial result holds :    [ prop1 ] let @xmath72 be a binary word of length @xmath48 having @xmath81 @xmath28-elements inside .",
    "let us consider the @xmath82 matrix @xmath5 obtained by row wise arranging the @xmath48 cyclic shifts of @xmath72 .",
    "then , @xmath5 has the horizontal and vertical projections equal to @xmath2 .",
    "as already noticed , the rows of the matrix @xmath5 may not all be different . throughout the paper we will denote by @xmath83 the matrix obtained by row wise arranging all the different cyclic shifts of a word @xmath72 . to establish how many different rows can be obtained by shifting a given binary word , we need to recall the definitions and main properties of necklaces and lyndon words .",
    "following the notation in  @xcite , a _ binary necklace _ ( briefly _ necklace _ ) is an equivalence class of binary words under cyclic shift .",
    "we identify a necklace with the lexicographically least representative @xmath72 in its equivalence class , denoted by @xmath84 $ ] .",
    "the set of all ( the words representative of ) the necklaces with length @xmath48 is denoted @xmath85 .",
    "for example , @xmath86 an important class of necklaces are those that are aperiodic .",
    "an aperiodic ( i.e. period @xmath87 ) necklace is called a _ lyndon word_. let @xmath88 denote the set of all lyndon words with length @xmath48 .",
    "for example , @xmath89 .",
    "we denote fixed - density necklaces , and lyndon words in a similar manner by adding the parameter @xmath4 to represent the number of @xmath28-elements in the words .",
    "we refer to the number @xmath4 as the density of the word .",
    "thus the set of necklaces with density @xmath4 is represented by @xmath90 , and the set of lyndon words with density @xmath4 is represented by @xmath91 .",

    "then , step @xmath27 deletes the rows @xmath258 , and @xmath259 of the submatrix @xmath137 , being @xmath260 , as in fig .",
    "[ matrix4 ] , on the left .",
    "finally a rearrangement of the columns is needed in order to make the matrix compatible with the starting vector @xmath8 , as in fig .",
    "[ matrix4 ] , on the right .",
    "more precisely columns @xmath261 , @xmath262 , and @xmath99 are shifted in the first three positions , preserving their order .",
    "* remark : * a rearrangement of the columns of a matrix causes a related rearrangement of the elements of the vector of the vertical projections , without modifying the values of its elements .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward that such a rearrangement also preserves the inequality relation between the rows .",
    "the correctness of recspan1@xmath229 follows after observing that :    @xmath263 by definition of @xmath79 , it holds : @xmath264 in words , this means that the reconstructed matrix @xmath5 compatible with the homogeneous vectors @xmath236 and @xmath237 is a minimal one , w.r.t . the dimensions , including @xmath194 .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the number of rows of @xmath194 and @xmath5 is less than the rows of @xmath137 ;    @xmath265 in step @xmath26 , the vectors @xmath236 and @xmath237 satisfy condition @xmath27 by definition of @xmath79 , and since @xmath35 and @xmath8 do . as a consequence",
    "the call of rec@xmath242 always reconstructs a matrix @xmath5 ;    @xmath266 it is straightforward that the algorithm rec@xmath242 always inserts the submatrix @xmath137 , with @xmath166 , in @xmath5 .",
    "so , the deletion of the rows @xmath267 , according to the consecutive values of @xmath268 ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath152 , forces the vertical projections to maintain two different consecutive values at each time , and reaching the desired values .",
    "it is straightforward that the complexity of recspan1@xmath269 is the same as rec@xmath270 .",
    "the question of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a simple hypergraph @xmath271 with a given degree sequence is a long outstanding open question even in the case of a @xmath27-uniform hypergraph ( @xmath272 for each @xmath21 ) . in this paper",
    ", we answered to this question in the special case where @xmath3 is @xmath2-uniform and @xmath4-regular or @xmath3 is @xmath2-uniform and almost @xmath4-regular , i.e. the degree sequence of @xmath273 is @xmath274 , @xmath275 , respectively .",
    "merging the results of the three previous sections we can state the following :        moreover , given a degree sequence satisfying the conditions of this theorem , we give two linear time ( in the size of the incidence matrix ) algorithms that construct a @xmath2-uniform @xmath4-regular hypergraph or a @xmath2-uniform almost @xmath4-regular hypergraph .",
    "a next step to the characterization of the degree sequence of a simple hypergraph would be its study for the subclass of uniform hypergraphs ( in particular three uniform hypergraphs ) with span @xmath79 , i.e. the degree of any vertex ranges from @xmath281 a set of @xmath79 successive values , where @xmath282 is a fixed integer .",
