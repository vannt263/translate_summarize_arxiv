    "segev , collings and abraham ( sca )  @xcite proposed an interesting mechanism for producing gunn domains by means of a photorefractive parametric excitation .",
    "it occurs when two optical waves of slightly different frequencies are incident upon a biased semiconductor crystal doped with deep impurity centers .",
    "the authors conjecture that the resulting traveling interference pattern excites multiple high - field gunn domains which move phase locked with the interference fringes .",
    "recently , l. subacius , _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite proposed an efficient way of creating simultaneously a number of quasilocalized high field gunn domains through hot carrier transport in spatially modulated and nonuniformly heated electron - hole plasma , and present some numerical results and preliminary experimental confirmation .    in this paper we present a consistent model of the photorefractive gunn effect and carry out numerical simulations to understand the dynamics of the system .",
    "we find that high field domains can indeed be triggered by phase - locked interference fringes , as suggested by sca .",
    "however , the response of the system can be very complex , and it is not possible to use a simplified version of kroemer s nl criterion , as suggested by sca , to predict the number of high field gunn domains traveling through the sample .",
    "indeed , our results indicate that with appropriate values of the parameters of the system the response becomes chaotic and this is , therefore , another example of driven ( sinusoidal interference pattern of intensity @xmath0 ) chaos .",
    "the following equations describe the photorefractive gunn effect , @xmath1 where ( [ d1]-[d2 ] ) are the continuity equations for ionized donors and for electrons respectively , and ( [ d3 ] ) is poisson s law . in these equations , @xmath2 , is the space variable in the direction of current flow , @xmath3 , is the time , @xmath4 , represents the number density of ionized donors , @xmath5 , the total donor density , @xmath6 , the incident light intensity , @xmath7 , the photoionization cross section , @xmath8 , the recombination rate , @xmath9 , the electron number density , @xmath10 the electron charge , @xmath11 , the current density , @xmath12 , the space - charge field inside the crystal , @xmath13 , the density of negatively charged acceptors , and , @xmath14 , the low frequency dielectric constant .    the light intensity , @xmath6 , is given by @xmath15 \\label{intens } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , as decribed in @xcite , is the intensity of the moving interference pattern formed when two quasimonochromatic plane waves of slightly different frequencies , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and slightly different angles of incidence illuminate a bulk semiconductor crystal . in ( [ intens ] )",
    "@xmath19 is the interference wave number , @xmath20 the modulation depth of the interference grating , and @xmath21 the total average intensity .    following sze  @xcite [ eq .",

    "the constant of integration , @xmath33 , is the total current density . introducing the electron current density given by ( [ j1 ] ) in the previous equation , leads to ampre s equation , @xmath34}{\\partial z } \\ , + \\ , \\varepsilon_s \\ , \\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t}. \\label{ampere}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that in eq .",
    "( 6 ) of @xcite the current density erroneously includes the displacement term , and this leads to an incorrect ampre s equation in which the displacement current drops out .",
    "in addition to these equations the electric field distribution must satisfy the _ reverse bias _",
    "condition for a given applied voltage @xmath35 , @xmath36 thus , to model the photorefractive gunn effect we use the correct form of ampre s law ( [ ampere ] ) , the continuity equation for ionized donors ( [ d1 ] ) , poisson s law ( [ d3 ] ) , the bias condition ( [ bias ] ) , and appropriate initial and boundary conditions . solution of these equations using the known functions for the light intensity ( [ intens ] ) and drift velocity ( [ vdee ] ) , provide the four unknowns , @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath37 .",
    "it should be emphasized that boundary conditions play an essential role in the existence of the gunn effect . although it can be debated which are the correct conditions to apply in order to simulate a particular experiment , periodic boundary conditions , as used in @xcite ,",
    "should be avoided : they yield a total current density which is constant in time when a dc voltage bias is imposed .",
    "in fact , integrating ampre s law we find @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "then imposing periodic boundary conditions and a dc voltage bias we find that @xmath39 ( provided we have a domain moving at constant speed @xmath40 ; note that with physically reasonable boundary conditions , the domain can not move at constant speed as it arrives at a realistic contact , e.g.   ohmic ) .",
    "since the gunn effect refers to time - dependent oscillations of the current under dc voltage bias , one should not use periodic boundary conditions when discussing it .",
    "the most important boundary condition in a study of the gunn effect in long samples is that for the injecting contact .",
    "in fact , the formation of gunn domains is due to a periodic destabilization of the boundary layer attached to such contact during the oscillations @xcite . during the formation of a new wave at the injecting boundary the displacement current plays a crucial role and can not be neglected .",
    "thus , we use an ohmic condition at the injecting contact , @xmath41 @xcite , and @xmath42 at the receiving contact ( which is thus passive and integration time is saved ) .",
    "when @xmath43 is such that @xmath44 intersects @xmath24 on its decreasing branch , the gunn effect is found for @xmath45 and appropriate values of the bias @xmath35 @xcite .    in order to solve numerically our model equations , we will first write them in nondimensional form .",
    "let us redefine our variables in dimensionless form as follows : @xmath46 inserting this in ( 1 ) , ( 3)-(8 ) , we obtain @xmath47 \\ , ( 1 \\ , - \\ ,    \\alpha \\ , p ) \\ , - \\ , \\beta \\ , \\eta \\ , p , \\label{nd3 } \\\\ & & \\int_0 ^ 1 f \\",

    "\\label{nd4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have defined the following nondimensional parameters ( we assume constant diffusivity , @xmath48 ) : @xmath49",
    "we have solved ( [ nd1 ] ) - ( [ nd4 ] ) numerically for different values of the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , keeping fixed @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "these numerical values correspond to those used by sca  @xcite .",
    "we were particularly interested in testing a central piece of sca s analysis , namely their particular use of kroemer s nl criterion , eq .",
    "( 20 ) . prompted by sca s suggestion that the length in kroemer s criterion may be the distance between multiple domains , we combine eq .  ( 20 ) with eq .",
    "( 17 ) for the electron density @xmath60 , and use @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the distance between adjacent domains",
    ". then we obtain a formula for the maximum number ( @xmath63 ) of high field domains which may coexist : @xmath64 we have used sca s numerical values ( @xmath21 and @xmath65 are measured in w.m@xmath66 and hz , respectively ) .",
    "1 depicts the level curves @xmath67 which are obtained when @xmath68 takes on different integer values .",
    "if sca s theory holds , @xmath69 between the level curves @xmath70 and @xmath71 . however , we observed gunn domains ( fig .",
    "2a ) where segev et al s theory predicts they should not be ( point a in fig .  1 ) .",
    "points c and d in fig .  1 would correspond to coexistence of @xmath72 and @xmath73 domains respectively , but we find four domains and a periodic response ( fig .",
    "2c ) and a quasi chaotic response ( fig .",
    "2d ) respectively .",
    "finally , at point b corresponding to the conditions proposed by sca to illustrate their theory , one domain is created during each oscillation period ( fig .",
    "in fact , the response of the system is very complex and within each of those zones in the @xmath67 plane , where a constant number of high field domains is predicted it is possible to find all kinds of behavior : periodic with a single frequency , periodic with a high number of frequencies and chaotic .",
    "the discrepancy between the computed and predicted response should not be surprising .",
    "in fact , the gunn effect is a periodic oscillation of the current ( @xmath74 ) in a dc voltage biased semiconductor presenting negative differential velocity .",
    "it is due to periodic shedding and motion of charge dipole waves ( high field domains ) at a boundary or a nucleation site .",
    "it is intrinsically nonlinear @xcite so that the relevance of linear approximations such as those used in @xcite is questionable .",
    "we think that kroemer s nl criterion implies that for a given model ( equations , bias , boundary and initial conditions ) it can be proved that no oscillatory instability is possible unless the nl product ( where l is semiconductor length and n is doping density ) is above a certain number . for kroemer s model of the gunn effect in n - gaas under dc voltage bias see figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "an analytical estimate ( probably not a very precise one ) could be obtained by adapting to the kroemer model the arguments in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "this said , sca have used a particular version of the nl criterion in which n is an electron density and l is either the semiconductor length ( one domain ) or the distance between domains ( multiple domains ) .",
    "it is not surprising that this usage produces results that are not quantitatively correct .",
    "it is interesting to compare the response of the system in points c and d of figure 1 .",
    "we observe that the dimensionless current density , @xmath75 , in case c is periodic ( fig .",
    "2 ) although it contains a large number of frequencies , as can be seen in the fft spectrum shown in the lower right of the figure . instead , the response in case d is not periodic and the fft spectrum appears chaotic .",
    "the difference between these two cases can be understood by looking at the electric field profiles as a function of time . in case c",
    ", there are several waves that originate at the injecting contact ( right contact ) and propagate towards the receiving contact .",
    "each of these waves does not overtake the previous one and this leads to a smooth , periodic response . in case d",
    ", however , a wave originates at the injecting contact and propaggates through the sample .",
    "later , a new wave is injected which moves faster than the previous one , and that overtakes it before reaching the receiving contact .",
    "the interaction between waves inside the sample , leads to a complex response which may become chaotic .    to understand the transition between the periodic and chaotic solutions we carried out numerical simulations for a fixed value of @xmath65 and varying the intensity @xmath21 within a certain small range corresponding to line e in figure 1 .",
    "the results of these simulations are summarized in figure 3 which shows the intensity of each mode of the fft spectrum as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "notice that there is a frequency , which is very close to the excitation frequency , @xmath65 , which appears for all values of @xmath21 .",
    "also , all integer multiples of this frequency are present in the current density history .",
    "it can also be observed that there is a sharp transition between a periodic solution and a chaotic one .",
    "figure 4 shows the current density history and field profiles for case f in the periodic region , and for case g inside the chaotic region .",
    "the bias condition imposes a conservation of area in the electric field profile @xmath76 for all time .",
    "thus , the size of a travelling wave must decrease when a new wave is generated in the injecting contact ( right contact ) .",
    "if the new wave grows fast enough the old wave must disappear to keep the area constant .",
    "in both cases , see f and g in fig . 4 ,",
    "several waves are born at the injecting contact and propagate towards the receiving contact during a period . in case f , all the waves reach the left contact and this leads to a periodic response in the density current . as the intensity @xmath21 increases , the wave formation velocity increases until a critical value above which the waves that propagate through the sample disappear before reaching the receiving contact .",
    "this produces a complex behavior with different patterns of formation - disappearance of waves .",
    "larger values of @xmath21 result in chaotic responses such as that shown in case g as an example .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that within the chaotic region there are windows in which the response becomes again periodic , with frecuency given by the fundamental frequency divided by 2 , 3 or 4 . in these specific ranges of @xmath21 , the interaction between waves inside the sample produces a simple pattern with a periodic sequence .",
    "we have thus found that high field domains could indeed be triggered by phase - locked interference fringes , as suggested by sca . however a literal use of their version of kroemer s nl criterion does not often agree with numerical simulations of the model for photorefractive gunn effect .",
    "in addition , we have found very interesting examples of natural and driven ( sinusoidal interference pattern of intensity @xmath0 ) chaos when appropriate parameter values are used . in the regime for which the high field domains carry a large fraction of the bias , an asymptotic theory of the gunn effect @xcite can be extended and applied to the photorefractive model , and used to interpret and predict the results of the numerical simulations with greater accuracy than sca s linearized approach .",
    "these results will be presented elsewhere ."
