    "solar , atmospheric and long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments obtained convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive and mixed particles . since on one hand solar and kamland experiments and on the other hand atmospheric and k2k experiments are sensitive to oscillations generated by different orders of magnitude of differences of squared neutrino masses , at least two independent @xmath1 are needed in order to explain the data .",
    "this requirement is satisfied by the simplest three - neutrino mixing scheme in which the left - handed components @xmath2 of flavor neutrinos ( @xmath3 ) are linear combinations of the left - handed components @xmath4 of massive neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the unitary mixing matrix ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) . in such framework",
    "neutrino oscillations depend on two independent squared - mass differences @xmath8 and @xmath9 , that we associate by convention to the squared - mass differences that are effective in solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , respectively : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath9 is needed because two type of schemes , shown in fig.[3nu ] , are allowed by the observed hierarchy @xmath1 . in the normal scheme ,",
    "which is so - called because it allows a mass hierarchy @xmath12 , @xmath9 is positive , whereas in the inverted scheme @xmath9 is negative .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , > \" , ]      +    neutrino oscillations depend on the difference of neutrino masses , not on their absolute value .",
    "as we will see in the following , other experiments are able to give information on the absolute value of neutrino masses .",
    "figure  [ 3ma ] shows the values of the neutrino masses obtained from @xmath8 and @xmath13 in tab.[fit ] as functions of the unknown lightest mass , which is @xmath14 in the normal scheme and @xmath15 in the inverted scheme . as shown in the figure , the case @xmath16",
    "is conventionally called `` inverted hierarchy '' , whereas in both normal and inverted schemes we have quasi - degeneracy of neutrino masses for @xmath17 .            in the following",
    "we review the phenomenology of absolute neutrino masses in tritium @xmath0 decay ( section  [ tritium ] ) , cosmological measurements ( section  [ cosmological ] ) and neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay ( section  [ neutrinoless ] ) .",
    "the measurement of the electron spectrum in @xmath0 decays provides a robust direct determination of the values of neutrino masses . in practice",
    "the most sensitive experiments use tritium @xmath0 decay , because it is a super - allowed transition with a low @xmath18-value .",
    "information on neutrino masses is obtained by measuring the kurie function @xmath19 given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron kinetic energy .",
    "the effect of neutrino masses can be observed near the end point of the electron spectrum where @xmath22 .",
    "a low @xmath18-value is important because the relative number of events occurring in an interval of energy @xmath23 below the end - point is @xmath24 .    since the present experiments do not see any effect due to neutrino masses , it is possible to approximate @xmath25 and obtain @xmath26 which is a function of only one parameter , the effective neutrino mass @xcite @xmath27    the current best upper bounds on @xmath28 are given by the mainz and troitsk experiments ( see ref.@xcite ) , which obtained the same value @xmath29 in the future the katrin experiment @xcite will reach a sensitivity of about @xmath30 .    in the standard parameterization of the mixing matrix we have ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 )",
    "@xmath33 since the values of @xmath8 , @xmath13 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are determined by neutrino oscillation experiments , there is only one unknown quantity in eq.([g031 ] ) , which corresponds to the absolute scale of neutrino masses .",
    "figure  [ mb ] shows the value of @xmath28 as a function of the unknown lightest mass , which is @xmath14 in the normal scheme and @xmath15 in the inverted scheme , using the values of the oscillation parameters in tab.[fit ] .",
    "the middle solid lines correspond to the best fit and the extreme solid lines delimit the @xmath36 allowed range .",
    "we have also shown with dashed lines the @xmath36 ranges of the neutrino masses ( same as in fig.[3ma ] ) , which help to understand their contribution to @xmath28 .",
    "one can see that in the case of a normal mass hierarchy ( normal scheme with @xmath12 ) the main contribution to @xmath28 can be due to @xmath37 or @xmath15 or both , because the upper limit for @xmath28 is larger than the upper limit for @xmath37 . in the case of an inverted mass hierarchy ( inverted scheme with @xmath16 )",
    "@xmath28 has practically the same value as @xmath14 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ mb ] shows that the mainz and troitsk experiments and the future katrin experiment give information on the absolute values of neutrino masses in the quasi - degenerate region in both normal and inverted schemes . in the far future",
    "the inverted scheme could be excluded if experiments with a sensitivity of about @xmath38 will not find any effect of neutrino masses .",
    "if neutrinos have a mass of the order of 1 ev they constitute a so - called `` hot dark matter '' , which suppresses the power spectrum of density fluctuations in the early universe at `` small '' scales of the order of 1@xmath3910 mpc ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the suppression depends on the sum of neutrino masses @xmath40 .",
    "recent high precision measurements of density fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( wmap ) and in the large scale structure of galaxies ( 2dfgrs , sdss ) , combined with other cosmological data have allowed to put stringent upper limits on @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "however , different authors have obtained significantly different upper bounds mainly because of the different sets of data considered .",
    "the most crucial data are the so - called lyman-@xmath41 forests which are constituted by absorption lines in the spectra of high - redshift quasars due to intergalactic hydrogen clouds . since these clouds have dimensions of the order of 1@xmath3910 mpc , the lyman-@xmath41 data are crucial in order to push the upper bound on @xmath40 below 1 ev .",
    "unfortunately the interpretation of lyman-@xmath41 data may suffer from large systematic uncertainties . summarizing the different limits obtained in refs.@xcite",
    ", we estimate the approximate @xmath42 upper bounds @xmath43 with and without lyman-@xmath41 data , respectively . from fig  [ cosmo ]",
    "one can see that both these limits constrain the neutrino masses in the quasi - degenerate region , where the upper bound on each individual mass is one third of the bound on the sum . in the future the inverted scheme can be excluded by an upper bound of about @xmath44 on the sum of neutrino masses .",
    "neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay is a very important process because it is not only sensitive to the absolute value of neutrino masses , but mainly because it is allowed only if neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite .",
    "a positive result in neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay would represent a discovery of a new type of particles , majorana particles , a fundamental improvement in our understanding of nature .",
    "neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decays are processes of type @xmath45 , in which no neutrino is emitted , with a change of two units of the total lepton number .",
    "these processes , forbidden in the standard model , have half - lives @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the phase - space factor , @xmath48 is the nuclear matrix element and @xmath49 is the effective majorana mass",
    ".    a possible indication of neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay of @xmath50 with half - life @xmath51 has been found by the authors of ref.@xcite , whereas other experiments found only lower bounds .",
    "the most stringent lower bound on @xmath52 has been obtained in the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite : @xmath53 the igex experiment @xcite obtained the comparable limit @xmath54 ( 90% cl ) .",
    "hence , the status of the experimental search for neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decays is presently uncertain and new experiments which can check the indication ( [ d05 ] ) are needed ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the extraction of the value of @xmath55 from the data has unfortunately a serious problem due to the large theoretical uncertainty in the evaluation of the nuclear matrix element @xmath48 ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "in the following we will use as `` @xmath36 '' range for the nuclear matrix element @xmath56 the interval which covers the results of reliable calculations listed in tab.2 of ref.@xcite ( other approaches are discussed in refs.@xcite ) : @xmath57 which corresponds to a `` @xmath36 '' uncertainty of a factor of 3 for the determination of @xmath55 from @xmath52 .",
    "using the range ( [ d04 ] ) , the indication ( [ d05 ] ) implies @xmath58 and the most stringent upper bound ( [ d06 ] ) implies @xmath59    in the standard parameterization of the mixing matrix the effective majorana mass is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are unknown majorana phases ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ db ] shows the allowed range for @xmath55 obtained with the mixing parameters in tab.[fit ] ( see also refs.@xcite ) .",
    "one can see that in the region where the lightest mass is very small the allowed ranges for @xmath55 in the normal and inverted schemes are dramatically different .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the normal scheme strong cancellations between the contributions of @xmath37 and @xmath15 are possible , whereas in the inverted scheme the contributions of @xmath14 and @xmath37 can not cancel because maximal mixing in the 1@xmath392 sector is excluded by solar data ( @xmath63 at @xmath64 @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no difference between the normal and inverted schemes in the quasi - degenerate region , which is probed by the present data . from fig.[db ] one can see that there is a tension between the indication ( [ d08 ] ) and the cosmological upper bound on individual neutrino masses , especially the one with lyman-@xmath41 data . in the future , the normal and inverted schemes may be distinguished by reaching a sensitivity of about @xmath65 .",
    "in conclusion we would only like to emphasize the fundamental importance of the determination of the dirac or majorana nature of neutrinos and their absolute mass scale .",
    "improvements on these topics should be strongly pursued in future experimental and theoretical research ."
