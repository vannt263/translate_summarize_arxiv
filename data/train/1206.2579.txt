    "standard quantum computing @xcite is based on encoding , manipulating , and measuring quantum information encoded in the state of a collection of quantum two - level systems - qubits .",
    "spin-@xmath0 is an ideal implementation of a qubit , since it is a natural two - level system , and every pure state of a spin-@xmath0 corresponds to a state of a qubit .",
    "for this reason , spins have been considered as carriers of quantum information in a variety of proposals @xcite . the initial proposal @xcite called for spins in single - electron quantum dots electrically manipulated by the exchange interaction and local time - dependent zeeman fields . a variety of other encoding schemes and manipulation techniques @xcite rely upon encoded qubits . in these schemes ,",
    "the simplicity of qubit states and minimal number of physical carriers of quantum information are traded for less stringent requirements for experimental implementations . on one hand ,",
    "the alternative setups protect from the most common types of errors by decoupling the computational degrees of freedom from the most common sources of noise , and therefore allow for longer gating times . on the other hand , in some alternative setups",
    "the manipulation without fast switching of the local magnetic fields becomes possible .",
    "the optimization in the encoding and manipulation protocols is always guided by the state of the art in the experiments .",
    "recent results suggest that spin qubits can reside in a variety of material hosts with novel properties .",
    "quantum dots in graphene @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite are less susceptible to the decoherence due to nuclei and spin - orbit interaction .",
    "spins in nanowires show very strong confinement in two spatial directions , and the gating is comparably simple @xcite . in hole systems ,",
    "the carriers have distinct symmetry properties , and show coupling to the nuclear spins of a novel kind @xcite .",
    "recently , the experiments in silicon @xcite have demonstrated coherent manipulation of spins similar to the one achieved in the gaas - based nanostructures . within these hosts ,",
    "the manipulation techniques that use exchange interaction , spatially inhomogeneous time independent zeeman splitting , and nuclear hyperfine interactions are within reach . despite these developments",
    ", gaas remains a promising route to spin qubits due to the highly advanced experimental techniques developed for this material .    here , we study the implementation of the quantum gates on the encoded two - spin singlet - triplet ( st ) qubits @xcite using resources that closely resemble the ones available in the current experimental setups . there , the application of the time - dependent electric fields through the gates fabricated into a structure @xcite are preferred to time - dependent local magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , the nuclear spins @xcite and inhomogeneous magnetic fields @xcite are possible resources for spin control . in the setups based on semiconductors , the electrons or holes in the quantum dots",
    "are influenced by the spin orbit interaction ( soi ) , which can contribute to the control @xcite .    in this work",
    "we present a scheme for control of st - qubits which uses switching of the exchange interaction as a primary resource .",
    "we consider the scheme that is optimized for the application of quantum gates in the network of quantum dots .",
    "the construction of the cnot gate uses pulses of the exchange interaction as the only parameter that is time dependent .",
    "the exchange interaction itself is not sufficient for the universal quantum computation over the st - qubits due to its high symmetry .",
    "the additional symmetry breaking is provided by nonuniform , but static magnetic fields .",
    "these fields describe the influence both of magnetic fields , provided by the nearby magnets , and of the coupling to the nuclear spins in the host material via hyperfine interaction . depending on the scheme used for the application of the quantum gates ,",
    "the optimal geometry is either the one in which the magnetic fields point parallel to the axis of symmetry of the soi or perpendicular to it .",
    "one major problem in the realization of two - qubit quantum gates ( in particular , we consider here the cnot gate based on conditional phase gates ) , is the possibility of leakage errors where the spin states defining the logical qubit leave the computational space .",
    "these errors move the state of four spins from the @xmath1-dimensional computational space of two qubits into some other portion of the @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space of four spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "we consider two ways of addressing this problem .",
    "one scheme possesses the axial symmetry due to the fact that the soi vector and magnetic fields are parallel . for this ` parallel scheme '",
    "we are able to construct a perfect cnot gate , if we are able to control all the available parameters . having in mind 2d architectures",
    ", we also consider the cnot gate between two qubits in the case when the soi vector and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other . here",
    "we can not prevent the leakage out of the computational space , however , we show that it is suppressed by a ratio between the soi and zeeman energy coming from a strong external magnetic field .",
    "all our constructions assume that the controlled interactions are switched in time by rectangular pulses . any deviations from this form of time",
    "dependence lead to additional corrections and affect the fidelity of the gate .",
    "the paper is organzied as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the model for the double dots and effective hamiltonians for field gradients and exchange and spin orbit interactions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : parallel ] , we consider the parallel geometry and derive the cnot gate via the conditional phase gates and swap gates , all based on exchange .",
    "there we also give estimates for the switching times .",
    "the scheme for the perpendicular geometry is then addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : perp ] , and we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "parallel geometry : four quantum dots ( yellow discs ) aligned along the x - axis in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath3 that is applied parallel to the soi vector @xmath4 ( red arrow ) , which must be perpendicular to the line of the dots and which we take to be the @xmath5-direction . at each dot",

    "each dot contains a spin-1/2 , and the exchange ( @xmath7 ) and the soi - induced ( @xmath8 ) interactions between the spins can be controlled by changing the electrostatic potential between the dots .",

    "[ fig : setupallz ] and  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "such st - qubits have been realized successfully in several labs @xcite , and single and two - qubit operations have also been demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "there are several schemes for the fundamental cnot gate , which can be divided into two classes , schemes which make use of exchange interaction and schemes which do not , but instead rely on coupling of dipole moments @xcite .",
    "the latter schemes has the disadvantage to be rather slow and also to be affected by charge noise rather strongly . here ,",
    "we focus on exchange - based schemes specifically adapted to quantum dots in iii - v semiconducting materials , that have the soi , such as in gaas or inas quantum dots .",
    "although the soi is typically small compared to the level spacing of the dots , it needs to be taken into account in order to achieve high fidelities in gate operations .",
    "we focus now on two such st - qubits and assume them to be encoded in four quantum dots that are arranged in a row , see figs .",
    "[ fig : setupallz ] and  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the external magnetic field @xmath9 is assumed to give the largest energy scale and determines the spin quantization axis @xmath5 .",
    "the hilbert space of four spins-@xmath0 is spanned by @xmath10 basis states .",
    "the total spin of the system is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a spin-@xmath0 operator acting on the spin in a dot @xmath13 .",
    "due to axial symmetry , the z - component , @xmath14 , becomes a good quantum number , and the eigenstates corresponding to @xmath15 span a six - dimensional subspace .",
    "we define the computational basis of the two st - qubits in this subspace as @xmath16 denotes the st - qubit space , ` @xmath17 ' and ` @xmath18 ' denote states of the quantum dot spins corresponding to the projection @xmath19 on the @xmath5 axis .",

    "choosing @xmath158 where @xmath159 is a positive integer , we obtain the @xmath56-gate , @xmath160 both eqs .",
    "( [ eq : t23 ] ) and ( [ t_231 ] ) should be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "for example , if @xmath161 and @xmath162 , we get @xmath163 from this we can estimate the total switching time to perform the @xmath56-gate that is a sum of the switching times at each step [ see eq .",

    "[ sec_c ] and [ sec_pi ] the slowest part is given by the swap gates @xmath60 and @xmath61 , whose switching time is limited by field gradients ( due to nuclear spins @xcite and/or micromagnets ) , @xmath164 , which corresponds to @xmath165 .",
    "the gate can be faster if the rotations around the @xmath5-axis are performed not on the equator but more closely to the poles .",
    "this allows us to decrease the switching time of the swap gate to @xmath166 ; however , this would require a more precise control over the pulses .",
    "the same trick can be used to decrease the switching time of the conditional phase gate @xmath59 ( compare figs .",
    "[ fig:23_rotation ] and [ fig:23_rotation_alt ] ) .",
    "if field gradients larger than @xmath167 are used , the switching rates will be proportionately larger .",

    "( [ t_231 ] ) . during the second pulse , @xmath107 , the state precesses around the @xmath5-axis over a shorter path than the one in fig .",
    "[ fig:23_rotation ] . as a result ,",

    "this is certainly an idealization , and in practice we expect deviations from this shape to cause errors for the gates and to affect the gate fidelity .",
    "the study of this issue , being very important for practical purposes , requires a separate investigation and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the parallel geometry for which we were able to construct a perfect cnot gate under the assumption that we have a complete control over the parameters .",
    "the cnot gate , together with single - qubit gates , allows us to simulate any other quantum gate and its implementation is a crucial step toward the realization of a quantum computer @xcite . in a next step ,",
    "many such elementary gates need to be connected into a large network . in recent years",
    ", the surface code @xcite has emerged as one of the most promising platforms for this goal due to its large threshold of about @xmath176 for fault tolerant error correction @xcite .",
    "this platform requires a two - dimensional ( 2d ) geometry and can be implemented in semiconductors of the type considered here . @xcite .",

    "two dots define an st - qubit ( black dotted ellipses ) .",
    "an external magnetic field @xmath3 and local magnetic fields ( blue arrows ) are parallel . in the case of the coupling between two qubits from the same row ( red solid ellipse )",
    "the soi vector @xmath177 is parallel to the magnetic field @xmath3 , corresponding to the parallel geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setupallz ] ) . in the case of coupling between two qubits from two neighboring rows (",
    "red dashed ellipse ) the soi vector @xmath178 is perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath3 , corresponding to the perpendicular geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]).,width=226 ]    the basic 2d scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] .",
    "there , we show an array of quantum dots where two neighboring dots in a given row represent one st - qubit .",
    "these quantum dots are embedded in a semiconductor where the soi is of the same type in the entire structure . as a typical example we mention rashba and/or dresselhaus soi that both depend on the momentum of the electron . as a result , the direction of the soi vector @xmath4 is always perpendicular to the line along which two quantum dots are coupled by exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "thus , for the coupling of two such qubits in the _ same _ row , the soi vector @xmath4 is parallel to the external magnetic field @xmath3 , so we can use the scheme designed for the parallel geometry in the previous section . in contrast , if we want to couple two qubits from _ neighboring _ rows , we should also consider a ` perpendicular geometry ' ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : setupallz ] and [ fig:2d ] ) in which the soi vector @xmath4 is perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "this perpendicular geometry is characterized by several features . as was mentioned before , the axial symmetry in this case",
    "is broken by the soi , leading to the coupling between computational ( @xmath179 ) and non - computational ( @xmath180 ) space .",
    "if the magnetic field @xmath181 is sufficiently large to split the triplet levels @xmath182 far away from the computational space ( @xmath183 ) , we can neglect this leakage .",
    "we estimate for gaas @xmath184 . at the same time",
    ", the soi does not couple states within the computational space , so for the realization of the phase gate @xmath59 and the swaps gates @xmath60 and @xmath61 we can use the same scheme as in sec .",
    "[ sec : parallel ] only with @xmath185 .",
    "we have studied the implementation of the cnot gate for st - qubits in a model that is appropriate for current experiments @xcite .",
    "the setup consists of an array of quantum dots with controlled growth direction and the relative orientation of the dots .",
    "pairs of neighboring dots build the st - qubits , where the quantization axis is determined by an externally applied magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , we introduce an inhomogeneity in magnetic fields , @xmath6 , by local micromagnets or by the hyperfine field .",
    "the resources used for time - dependent control are the exchange interaction @xmath31 , the field gradients @xmath186 , and the soi vector @xmath187 .    if the soi vector @xmath4 is parallel to the external ( @xmath3 ) and local magnetic fields ( @xmath6 ) , we are able to construct a perfect scheme for the cnot gate based on the @xmath56-phase gate , @xmath57 , consisting of four basic steps .",
    "two of the steps involve interaction of spins that belong to different qubits , and open the possibility of leakage errors . under condition of total control over system parameters , we show that the leakage can be eliminated . in the other two steps ,",
    "the tuning of exchange interaction enables perfect swap gates even in the presence of field gradients and soi .",
    "motivated by recent results on the surface code , we shortly comment also on the 2d architecture .",
    "here we encounter a situation in which the soi vector @xmath4 and the magnetic fields , @xmath3 and @xmath6 , are perpendicular . in this case , the leakage to the non - computational space with @xmath188 is inevitable .",
    "however , it can be made very small as long as @xmath189 .",
    "depending on the pulsing scheme , the switching times for the conditional phase gate are shown to lie in the range @xmath62-@xmath190 ns for typical gaas parameters .",
    "compared to the experimentally established decoherence times of about @xmath191 @xmath192s @xcite , this switching is sufficiently fast and shows that a cnot gate based on exchange is a promising candidate for experimental realizations .",
