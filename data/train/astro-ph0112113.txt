    "helioseismology has confirmed the importance of gravitational settling in the sun s external regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "turnoff stars in globular clusters are only slightly less massive than the sun and have convection zones that tend to be somewhat shallower . in solar type stars ,",
    "radiative accelerations have been shown to become equal to gravity for some metals around the end of the main sequence lives @xcite .",
    "the question of the atomic diffusion of metals in pop ii stars then naturally arises .",
    "it is currently of special interest because large telescopes are now making possible the determination of the abundance of metals in the turnoff stars of globular clusters . in this paper evolutionary models that take into account the diffusion of he , libeb and metals in pop ii stars",
    "are presented for the first time .",
    "surface abundances may then be used as additional constraints in the determination of the age of globular clusters and of the universe ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "given their old age , pop ii stars are those where the slow effect of atomic diffusion has the largest chance to play a role on the evolutionary properties .",
    "previously published evolutionary models of pop ii stars have included some of the effects of diffusion ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) but never included the effects of the diffusion of metals with their radiative accelerations self consistently .",
    "determining constraints on stellar hydrodynamics from abundance observations requires knowing the original chemical composition of the star . in pop ii stars",
    "there are larger variations in original abundances than in pop i. for that reason it is essential to use globular clusters for abundance determinations of metals since only then does one have a handle on the original abundances from observations of cluster giants .",
    "however libeb have an origin partly different from that of most metals . coupled with their sensitivity to low temperature nuclear burning",
    ", their abundance determination in halo stars provides useful constraints on hydrodynamics even if determinations in cluster stars would be preferable .",
    "the observation by @xcite of a plateau in the li concentration over a relatively large @xmath6 interval of pop ii stars has now been confirmed by many observations .",
    "furthermore , the li concentration is constant while that of fe varies by more than a factor of 100 @xcite from @xmath7 = - 3.7 $ ] to @xmath8 .",
    "this shows the primordial origin of li .",
    "its preservation for such a time interval over such a wide @xmath6 interval seriously challenges our understanding of convection and other potential mixing processes in those stars @xcite .",
    "if there were no mixing process outside of convection zones , the surface li abundance would vary with @xmath6 : at small @xmath6 because of nuclear reactions ( @xmath9 ) and at large @xmath6 because of gravitational settling . extending convection zones by a simple turbulence model",
    "does not solve the problem since , if the extension is sufficient to reduce li settling enough in the hotter stars , it causes excessive li destruction in the cooler stars of the plateau @xcite .",
    "efforts were also made to link such an extension to differential rotation ( @xcite or , as parametrized in the yale models , @xcite ) but the small apparent dispersion in the plateau makes this model unlikely .",
    "@xcite even claim that the destruction may not be by more than 0.1 dex .    several groups ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) have also observed @xmath10 in halo stars . since @xmath10 is destroyed at a smaller @xmath6 than @xmath11 , its survival in old stars implies a strict and small upper limit on the amount of mixing in those stars",
    ". the stars where a detection has been made are all concentrated close to the turnoff @xcite . while a mechanism has been suggested to produce @xmath12 in the sun @xcite , it is not expected to significantly affect atmospheric values so that a star in which @xmath12 is seen in the atmosphere may not have destroyed a significant fraction of its original @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite determined be abundances in halo stars as well as a linear correlation with the fe abundance suggesting that be has not been destroyed in those stars .",
    "the chemical composition of globular clusters is attracting more attention as large telescopes make the determination of the surface chemical composition of turnoff stars possible .",
    "the determination of the abundance of metals makes it possible to put additional constraints on the hydrodynamics of pop ii stars .",
    "some observers have reported factors of 2 differences between fe abundances in red giants and subgiants @xcite .",
    "however @xcite and @xcite find no difference between the abundances in red giants and turnoff stars .",
    "@xcite find the same relative abundances as in the sun in the turnoff stars of ngc@xmath136397 .",
    "unexplained anticorrelations between the abundances of o and na have been observed by @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the surface abundances to be expected in pop ii stars are calculated under different assumptions for the internal stellar hydrodynamics .",
    "the first and simplest assumption is that there is no macroscopic motion outside of convection zones .",
    "there remains only atomic diffusion , including the effects of gravitational settling , thermal diffusion and radiative accelerations , as a transport process outside of convection zones .",
    "on the main sequence , such models have been shown to lead to larger abundance anomalies than are observed @xcite but also to the appearance of an additional convection zone caused by the accumulation of iron peak elements @xcite .",
    "a relatively simple parametrization of turbulence , corresponding to an extension of those fe convection zones by a factor of about 5 in mass , was shown to lead to a simple explanation of the amfm phenomenon @xcite .",
    "a similar parametrization is used here in pop ii stars and leads to our second series of models .",
    "finally , we use an additional parametrization that is chosen in order to minimize the reduction of the surface li concentration , so as to provide the best representation of the spite plateau . @xcite",
    "introduced a similar parametrization of turbulence to compete with he and li settling ( other parametrizations of turbulence were introduced for the sun by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite has shown that weak turbulence below the solar convection zone also improves agreement with the solar pulsation spectrum .",
    "for comparison purposes , series of models are also calculated without diffusion and one model is calculated with gravitational settling but without @xmath4 ( see subsubsection  [ sec : structure ] ) .",
    "the models were calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "the radiative accelerations are from @xcite with the correction for redistribution from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the atomic diffusion coefficients were taken from @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the atomic and thermal diffusion coefficients have been discussed by @xcite , and by @xcite in particular for the temperature  density domain of the interior of pop ii stars and the sun .",
    "turbulent transport is included as in @xcite and @xcite where the parameters specifying turbulent transport coefficients are indicated in the name assigned to the model .",
    "for instance , in the t5.5d400 - 3 model , the turbulent diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 , is 400 times larger than the he atomic diffusion coefficient at @xmath15 and varying as @xmath16 . to simplify writing ,",
    "t5.5 will also be used instead of t5.5d400 - 3 since all models discussed in this paper have the d400 - 3 parametrization . the @xmath16 dependence is suggested ( see @xcite ) by observations that the be solar abundance today is hardly smaller than the original be abundance ( see for instance @xcite )    all models considered here were assumed to be chemically homogeneous on the pre - main sequence with the abundance mix appropriate for pop ii stars .",
    "the relative concentrations used are defined in table  [ tab : xinit ] .",
    "the relative concentrations of the _ alpha _ elements are increased compared to the solar mix as is believed to be appropriate in pop ii stars @xcite .      in @xcite , the solar luminosity and radius at the solar age",
    "were used to determine the value of @xmath17 , the ratio of the mixing length to pressure scale height , and of the he concentration in the zero age sun .",
    "they calibrated @xmath17 both in models using krishna - swamy s @xmath18 relation @xcite ( both with and without atomic diffusion ) and in models using eddington s @xmath18 relation ( only with diffusion ) .",
    "the he concentration mainly affects the luminosity while @xmath17 mainly determines the radius , through the depth of the surface convection zone .",
    "the required value of @xmath17 was found to be slightly larger in the diffusive than in the non diffusive models because an increased value of @xmath17 is needed to compensate for he and metals settling from the surface convection zone .",
    "the increased @xmath17 in the diffusion models of the sun is then determined by the settling occurring immediately below the solar surface convection zone .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of uncertainties related with the use of the mixing length in pop ii stars .",
    "some of the models presented in this paper were calculated with turbulence below the convection zone .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath17 to use then depends on the depth of turbulence .",
    "if turbulence is large enough to eliminate settling at the depth of solar models , the most appropriate @xmath17 to use is that determined for non diffusing solar models .",
    "if the adopted turbulence is more superficial than the solar convection zone , the appropriate @xmath17 to use is that for the solar models with diffusion . given the uncertainty , it was chosen to use the same value of @xmath19 for all models , both with and without diffusion , calculated with eddington s @xmath18 relation . in order to give an estimate of the uncertainty related to @xmath17 , two values of @xmath17 ( one determined by the solar model without diffusion and one by the solar model with diffusion ) will be used for one series of models with diffusion ( see subsection  [ sec : alternate_models ] ) .",
    "the calculated series of models are identified in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the series labeled ks@xmath17 used a value of @xmath17 determined from a solar model with diffusion while the series labeled ks used a value of @xmath17 determined from a solar model without diffusion .",
    "four series of evolutionary models were calculated . in the first subsection ,",
    "the models with atomic diffusion are presented . in the second one ,",
    "the models with turbulence and those without diffusion are introduced and compared to the models with atomic diffusion .",
    "two series of models with turbulence are discussed in some detail : a series that minimizes li underabundance and one that contains a level of turbulence similar to that needed to reproduce the observations of amfm stars . in the last subsection , the effect of changing boundary conditions is analyzed .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath20 as a function of age as well as the luminosity as a function of @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ fig : historic_noturb ] for evolutionary models calculated including atomic diffusion and only those physical processes that can currently be evaluated properly from first principles .",
    "that figure also contains the time variation of the depth of the surface convection zone , of the temperature at its bottom and of central h concentration .",
    "models were calculated for 0.5 to 1.0 @xmath3 stars from the pre - main  sequence to the bottom of the giant branch except for the 0.85 , 0.9 and 1.0 @xmath3 stars which were stopped earlier because of numerical instabilities .",
    "all models shown have @xmath21 .",
    "the mass interval was chosen to minimize the possibility of interpolation errors in the construction of isochrones ( see paper ii ) .",
    "the variation of the mass in the surface convection zone is large enough to play a major role on surface abundance evolution . in the next two subsections , the effect of radiative accelerations on surface abundances",
    "are related to the regression of the surface convection zone during evolution .",
    "the radiative accelerations below the surface convection zone play the most important role in determining the surface abundance variations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] ) .",
    "as the evolution of a 0.8 @xmath3 star proceeds during the main sequence phase , the surface convection zone becomes progressively thinner : between 6 and 11 gyr , the mass in the convection zone is reduced by a factor of about 20 , from @xmath22 to @xmath23 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : historic_noturb ] ) .",
    "the effect of this regression of the surface convection zone may be seen in the surface abundances through the dependence of @xmath4 on nuclear charge .",
    "the @xmath4 on li has a maximum at @xmath24 where it is in the hydrogenic configuration .",
    "it is completely ionized deeper in the star so that @xmath4(li ) is progressively reduced deeper in .",
    "the chemical species with a larger nuclear charge become ionized deeper in so that they are in an hydrogenic configuration deeper in and have the related maximum of their @xmath4 at greater depths . for , it is at @xmath25 , for at @xmath26 and for at @xmath27 .",
    "another maximum in the @xmath4 appears when a species is in between the atomic configurations of and .",
    "this maximum occurs at @xmath25 for p , and @xmath28 for .",
    "these maxima may be followed on the figure for other species . as may be seen from figure  [ fig : grad ] ,",
    "when the atomic species is in the hydrogenic configuration , the @xmath4 is rarely larger than gravity .",
    "it is larger only for be , b and c. at the maximum of @xmath4 between the -like and -like configurations , however , @xmath4 is usually larger than gravity .",
    "contrary to what happens in pop i stars @xcite , the @xmath4 do not depend on the abundance of the species since it is too small to cause flux saturation .",
    "the time variation of surface abundances in pop ii stars with atomic diffusion is shown in figure  [ fig : surf_abundance_diff ] .",
    "the surface abundances reflect the variation of the @xmath4 below the surface convection zone as it moves toward the surface . from figure",
    "[ fig : historic_noturb ] , one sees that the depth of the surface convection zone gets progressively smaller during evolution until hydrogen is exhausted from the center . in the 0.8 @xmath3 model",
    ", it starts at a depth of @xmath26 and is at @xmath29 after 11 gyr .",
    "one sees in figure  [ fig : grad ] that @xmath4(fe ) is smaller than gravity when the convection zone is deep but larger than gravity when it is more superficial . in the early evolution ,",
    "fe settles gravitationally though _ less rapidly _ than he or c , largely because @xmath4(fe ) is not much smaller than gravity . around 9 gyr , @xmath4(fe ) becomes larger than gravity below the surface convection zone .",
    "one sees the effect in the surface abundances ( figure  [ fig : surf_abundance_diff ] ) where the surface fe concentration starts increasing around 9 gyr , becoming larger than the original concentration around 10 gyr and reaching an overabundance by a factor of about 5 just before the star becomes a subgiant , at which point the fe abundance goes back to very nearly its original value as the convection zone becomes more massive .",
    "similar remarks apply to other chemical species .",
    "the depth dependence of the abundance variations is shown for a 0.8 @xmath3 model in figure  [ fig : intern_abundances ] .",
    "one first notices that the abundance of @xmath10 is modified by nuclear reactions over the inner 98% of the mass .",
    "atomic diffusion modifies the abundances over the outer 1% of the mass .",
    "this leaves hardly any intermediate zone . at 6.1 gyr ,",
    "the surface convection zone extends down to @xmath30 , where the @xmath4 are smaller than gravity for most species .",
    "only k , ca and ti start to be supported : their abundances in the surface convection zone are larger than immediately below . as evolution proceeds , the convection zone recedes . after 9.1 gyr , atomic species between na and ni are supported as the @xmath4 is larger than gravity below the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "this continues as the evolution proceeds . after 11.4 gyr ,",
    "the fe abundance , for instance , is 3 times larger than the original abundance in the surface convection zone . that increased concentration of fe is caused by the migration of fe above @xmath31 where its",
    "@xmath4 becomes larger than gravity . between @xmath29 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the concentration of fe decreases since it is either pushed into the surface convection zone by radiative accelerations ( for @xmath32 ) or settles gravitationally below . on the scale of that figure ,",
    "the concentration variations of fe are not seen for @xmath33 .",
    "it sinks toward the center of the star where a small fe overabundance appears .",
    "the diffusion time scales are long enough that the effects amount to nearly a 10% increase at the center after 11.4 gyr ( see fig .  [ fig : center_zoom ] ) .",
    "this figure may be compared to figures 15 and 16 of @xcite where the increase in fe concentration at the center is by about 3% at the age of the sun .",
    "transformation of c and o into n also modifies the value of @xmath34 so that it increases by only 4% at the center and has a maximum outside of the region where o is transformed into n.    in stars of other masses , surface abundances are also mainly determined by the depth reached by the surface convection zone . in the 0.7 @xmath3 model , the surface convection zone never gets thinner than @xmath35 so that no overabundances appear during evolution and underabundances are limited to a factor of about 2 . in the 0.9@xmath3 model on the other hand ,",
    "the surface fe abundance starts increasing around 2 gyr , when the surface convection zone becomes thinner than @xmath25 , where , as seen above , @xmath4(fe ) becomes larger than gravity . in this star ,",
    "fe becomes overabundant around 3 gyr . in pop",
    "ii stars of larger mass , the overabundances are larger because the surface convection zones are thinner .        from figure  [ fig : historic_noturb ]",
    ", one sees that even in one single model , say the 0.8 @xmath3 one , the mass in the convection zone varies from about @xmath36 to @xmath37 during the main  sequence evolution . linking turbulence to the position of the convection zone could never produce a small variation of li :",
    "if one increased the depth of the convection zone by a fixed factor , large enough to eliminate settling around 11 gyr for instance ( a factor of 100 or so is needed ) , this would lead to complete destruction of li in the early evolution . to minimize li abundance reduction , it is essential , if one uses time independent parametrization , to link turbulence to a fixed @xmath38 and not to the bottom of convection zones .",
    "the turbulent transport coefficients used in these calculations are shown in figure  [ fig : coefficients ] .",
    "we chose to introduce the turbulence that minimizes the reduction of the surface li abundance .",
    "we consequently defined the turbulent diffusion coefficient as a function of @xmath38 in order to adjust it most closely to the profile that limits gravitational settling of li while not burning li .",
    "the nuclear reaction @xmath9 is highly @xmath38 sensitive and the li burning occurs at @xmath39 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "turbulent diffusion was adjusted to be smaller than atomic diffusion slightly below that @xmath38 so that turbulence would reduce settling as much as is possible in surface layers without forcing li to diffuse by turbulence to @xmath39 .",
    "a few series of evolutionary models were run in order to optimize turbulence parameters .",
    "examples of the resultant interior li profiles are shown in figure  [ fig : coefficients ] .",
    "the li concentration always goes down rapidly as a function of increasing @xmath38 for @xmath39 . in the absence of turbulence , there is a peak in the li concentration at @xmath40 .",
    "this peak disappears as the strength of turbulence is increased .",
    "turbulence in the t5.5d400 - 3 model is too weak to influence li concentration in the @xmath38 interval shown .",
    "turbulence in the t6.0d400 - 3 model eliminates the li abundance gradient caused by gravitational settling down to @xmath41 while causing little reduction on the largest li abundance at @xmath40 .",
    "increasing turbulence further reduces the li peak , and in the t6.2 model the surface li abundance is smaller than in the t6.13 model , showing that one has passed the optimal value of turbulence .",
    "it is interesting to note that the turbulent diffusion coefficient of the t6.09d400 - 3 model of 0.8 @xmath3 is a factor of about 10 smaller than the turbulent diffusion coefficient found necessary to reproduce the solar li surface abundance by @xcite .",
    "the latter corresponds approximately to the t6.2d400 - 3 turbulent diffusion coefficient profile .",
    "on the other hand the t5.5d400 - 3 turbulent diffusion parametrization corresponds approximately , as a function of @xmath38 , to that found by @xcite to lead to the abundance anomalies observed in amfm stars .",
    "a comparison of the 0.8 @xmath3 models with and without diffusion is shown in figure  [ fig : with_without ] .",
    "first compare the hertzsprung - russell diagrams .",
    "all models with diffusion ( both with and without turbulence ) nearly have the same evolutionary tracks ( those with turbulence are somewhat hotter ) .",
    "however the one without atomic diffusion goes to significantly higher @xmath6 than all models with diffusion .",
    "we have also verified that the turnoff temperature is reached 6 to 7% earlier in the models with diffusion ( with or without turbulence ) than in the model without diffusion .",
    "these differences are reflected in the isochrones based on these tracks and therefore on globular cluster age determinations ( see paper ii ) .",
    "they partially come from the structural effects of the global redistribution of he but also from the 4 to 5% difference in the age at which the central h abundance is exhausted .",
    "this in turn is reflected in the shorter age ( also 4 to 5% ) at which all diffusion models become subgiants , as seen in the rapid decrease of @xmath6 but the rapid increases of the mass and @xmath38 at the bottom of the surface convection zone .",
    "while there are significant differences between the model without diffusion and all those with diffusion , the effect of the different turbulent transport models on the depth and mass at the bottom of the surface convection zone , and the time variation of the central h concentration are seen from figure  [ fig : with_without ] to be practically negligible on the scale of that figure . of the macroscopic properties defining the evolution of a 0.8@xmath3 star ,",
    "only the @xmath6 and @xmath42 appear to be modified by the turbulence models that were introduced .",
    "while it is not shown for other masses , it is also true for them .",
    "however it is shown in paper ii that the differences in @xmath6 that seem small on the scale of figure  [ fig : with_without ] are important in the comparison of calculated and observed isochrones .",
    "given that there are , in the literature , calculations of pop ii evolutionary tracks with gravitational settling but no @xmath4 , it is worth noting that the track ( @xmath43 relation ; upper left hand part of fig .",
    "[ fig : with_without ] ) of such a model is , around turnoff , slightly cooler than the track of the model with diffusion and @xmath4 but no turbulence .",
    "furthermore the abundance is very different , by a factor of about 1000 , at 12 gyr .",
    "the @xmath44 is smaller by 0.1 dex mainly because of the reduction of opacity caused by the reduction of the abundance .",
    "_ it is a better approximation not to let diffuse at all in a 0.8@xmath3 star than to calculate its gravitational settling without including the effects of @xmath4(fe)_. the abundance is smaller by a factor of 2 in this case both because of the reduction of the @xmath44 and because @xmath4(li ) has some effect in the 0.8 @xmath3 model .",
    "the surface abundance anomalies caused by atomic diffusion are much more affected by turbulence than the macroscopic properties . in the t5.5 model",
    ", turbulence reduces surface abundance anomalies but only in the time interval from 9 to 12 gyr . before 9 gyr ,",
    "the surface convection zone is deeper than @xmath45 while in the t5.5d400 - 3 model , the turbulent diffusion coefficient is larger than atomic diffusion only for temperatures up to @xmath46 .",
    "only when the surface convection zone has retracted sufficiently for turbulent diffusion to be larger than atomic diffusion below the convection zone , does turbulence have any effect . in this model",
    ", the turbulent diffusion coefficient does not suppress completely the effects of atomic diffusion ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : with_without ] ) .",
    "it reduces them by an amount dependent on the chemical species .",
    "an fe overabundance appears in the absence of turbulence but it is eliminated in the t5.5 model while the he underabundance is much less affected .",
    "the t6.0 model has the same turbulence profile as the t5.5d400 - 3 model except that the profile is shifted towards higher temperatures by a factor of 3 in @xmath38 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coefficients ] ) ; this leads to a much larger effect on abundance anomalies .",
    "it limits the effect of atomic diffusion on the surface abundances of he and li to a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "the effect of turbulent transport on the interior concentrations in a 0.8 @xmath0 star is shown , for two values of turbulence , in figure  [ fig : abtot_dif_6.09 ] . the no turbulence case is also shown for comparative purposes .",
    "the internal concentration profiles are shown at nearly the same age in the three models .",
    "such a star today would be close to the turnoff .",
    "it is also the evolutionary epoch when the effect of radiative accelerations and diffusion are largest and when the effect of adding a turbulent diffusion coefficient is greatest . in the case",
    ", the @xmath4 never play a large role since turbulence mixes down to @xmath48 and the @xmath4 are not much greater than gravity at that depth .",
    "in fact they are greater than gravity only for ti , cr , mn and fe and only around the end of evolution when @xmath4 causes settling to slow down in the exterior region .",
    "a minimum in abundances appears at @xmath49 because of that slow down in the settling from above while settling continues unabated below . in the star with the t5.5d400 - 3 parametrization , there is mixing from the surface down to @xmath50 .",
    "deeper in the star , radiative accelerations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] ) are greater than gravity over a sufficient mass interval to cause overabundances in the surface regions for chemical species between al and ca and for ni .",
    "the @xmath4 for mg , ti , cr , mn and fe are just sufficient to bring them back to their original abundance while most of the chemical species between he and na are less supported and remain underabundant in the atmosphere .",
    "the exceptions are b and c which are very nearly normal .",
    "this behavior is to be contrasted to that in the star with no turbulence , where mixing by the surface convection zone extends from the surface down to @xmath51 ; the concentration gradients below the convection zone are very steep because of the absence of turbulence ; this leads to larger overabundances , in particular a factor of 10 for si and s but of 3 for most fe peak elements ; while c becomes underabundant , b becomes overabundant .",
    "turbulence changes the position in the star where atomic diffusion dominates and so where the sign of @xmath52 matters .",
    "however , turbulent transport also modifies the steepness of concentration gradients . together with evolutionary time scales , these determine over vs under  abundances .",
    "this shows the need for complete evolutionary models in order to determine surface abundances .",
    "changing the surface boundary conditions has a significant effect on the depth of the surface convection zone ( see section  [ subsec : alpha ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : m_tbzc ] ) .",
    "two boundary conditions were used .",
    "both are often used for popii models . in their solar models , @xcite used mainly krishna swamy s @xmath18 relation .",
    "it is used here for some series of models .",
    "@xmath18 relation is also used : it was used for a and f pop i stars by @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the sun is used to determine the appropriate value of @xmath19 to use with each of these boundary conditions .",
    "one may view the difference in convection zone mass between the models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m_tbzc ] ) as a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty . during evolution ,",
    "the uncertainty varies from a factor of 1.3 to 1.6 in mass .",
    "this is sufficient to modify the fits to globular cluster isochrones ( see paperii ) .",
    "it has however a less pronounced effect on surface abundances than the uncertainty on turbulence .",
    "it modifies significantly surface abundances only when no turbulence is included in the models .",
    "the surface concentrations of the 28 species impose constraints on stellar models .",
    "they will be shown for three series of models , the atomic diffusion models with no turbulence , those that mimic the turbulence of amfm stars and those that minimize the effects of transport on surface li concentration .",
    "surface abundance variations as a function of time have been discussed above ( see subsections  [ sec : with diffusion ] and  [ sec : turbulent diffusion ] ) . they are discussed below as a function of atomic number and of @xmath53 in order to facilitate comparison to observations . in the first subsection",
    ", we present the results for all calculated species for individual stars . in the second subsection",
    ", we present results at a given age for stars of various masses as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "they are then compared to observations in the last subsection .      the surface concentrations at 10 and 12",
    "gyr are shown as a function atomic number in figure  [ fig : ab_z10 ] for the evolutionary models with atomic diffusion and no turbulence ( see also subsection  [ sec : with diffusion ] ) .",
    "the 0.7 @xmath3 model is the one with the smallest mass shown . in it , gravitational settling causes a general reduction of surface abundances by close to 0.2 dex .",
    "as may be seen from figure  [ fig : historic_noturb ] , the convection zone is always at least 1% of the mass in a 0.7 @xmath3 star so that radiative accelerations play a modest role ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] ) . in the 0.6 and 0.5 @xmath3 models ( not shown ) , the mass in the surface convection zone is always larger than about 20% of the stellar mass so that gravitational settling is negligible even after 10 or 12 gyr .    in stars of 0.75 @xmath3 or more",
    ", the surface convection zone occupies less than 0.1% of the stellar mass for part of the evolution .",

    "however , ar , k , ca and ti have their maximum concentrations below the convection zone so that some extra mixing increases their surface abundances . as a comparison with figure  [ fig : ab_z10 ] shows , the effect of adding turbulence is similar to that of considering a slightly more evolved , slightly more massive model ( compare the 0.8 @xmath3 star with t5.5 of fig .  [",
    "fig : ab_z12_08 ] with the 0.81 @xmath3 of fig .",

    "one first notes , by comparing to figure  [ fig : ab_teff12 ] , the strong reduction in all abundance variations around the turnoff but the general slight increase in all underabundances in stars with @xmath59 k. the increased underabundances reflect the increased time available for gravitational settling and the slight reduction in the depth of the surface convection zone between 12 and 13.5 gyr ( see fig . [ fig : historic_noturb ] ) .    at 13.5 gyr ,",
    "one then expects , in the absence of turbulence , underabundances of 0.05 dex at @xmath60 k increasing to 0.1 dex around 5500 k. above that @xmath6 , underabundances remain approximately constant for stars with the t6.09 turbulence model . if there is no turbulence , underabundances increase to 0.3 dex at 6000 k and above that @xmath6 both over and underabundances are present as @xmath4 play a significant role . for the fe peak elements ,",

    "its presence is sufficient to reduce the expected range of underabundances of fe to @xmath61 dex .",
    "since in this paper results are presented only for stars with @xmath21 , we will compare with the abundance determinations in m92 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in so far as one may assume all cluster stars to share the same original composition , giant stars give a handle on the original turnoff star composition .",
    "the observations of clusters with larger @xmath34 values will be discussed in a forthcoming paper where the evolutionary calculations for various values of @xmath34 will be presented .",
    "we will use li abundance in field halo stars with @xmath62 to complement the m92 observations . since li is believed to be of cosmological origin in these stars ,",

    "the stars calculated with the t6.09 model clearly fit the @xmath11 observations much better .",
    "both at 12 and 13.5 gyr , there is a uniform @xmath11 abundance extending from @xmath63 to 6000 k , in agreement with observations .",
    "it corresponds to an underabundance by 0.17 dex from the original li abundance .",

    "fig : ab_teff12 ] and fig .",

    "the series of models calculated without turbulence and that calculated with the t5.5 model do not reproduce the observations for @xmath64 k. given the observational error bars , the t6.09 model leads to a @xmath6 dependence of @xmath65(li ) which is perhaps more constant than required .",
    "however , at 12 gyr , calculations with the t6.0 model ( not shown ) give a li abundance 0.15 dex smaller at 6500 k than at 5600 k. while perhaps compatible with the error bars , this would lead to a significantly poorer fit and may be considered the lower limit to the turbulent transport required by observations .",
    "the lithium abundances observed in the m92 turnoff stars by @xcite are also shown in the 13.5 gyr part of the figure .",
    "the error bars are much larger than for field stars mainly because of the much smaller signal to noise ratio .",
    "the determined li abundances suggest a slightly larger original value for the li abundance in m92 than in halo stars but , given the size of the error bars , this could be considered uncertain .",
    "one star has a li abundance higher than the others by a factor larger than the error bars .",
    "other stars at the same @xmath6 have a clearly smaller equivalent width of the li doublet .",
    "the authors used this to argue for li destruction by a large factor in pop ii stars .",
    "this appears premature to us .",
    "@xcite have observed 7 metals mainly in three subgiant stars of m92 with @xmath66 k ( see their discussion of @xmath6 in their section 4.3 ) , which is slightly cooler than our 6300 k turnoff @xmath6 at 13.5 gyr .",
    "their determination of the fe abundance is based on more lines and appears more reliable than that of other metals .",
    "it is the only metal we discuss .",
    "their main conclusion is that the subgiants of m92 have a 0.26 dex lower fe abundance than the giants of m92 as determined by @xcite .",
    "they carefully discuss all sources of error and can not completely exclude that this 0.26 dex difference be reduced even possibly to zero . if the t6.09 turbulent transport model applies , all 3 stars should have the same fe abundance and it should be approximately 0.1 dex smaller than the original fe abundance according to our figure  [ fig : ab_teff13.5 ] .",
    "the giants should have the original fe abundance because of their large surface convection zones .",
    "this seems quite compatible with the observations of fe given the uncertainties .",
    "@xcite also find ( their section 4.2 ) that star 21 has a 0.15 dex larger fe abundance than the other two ( stars 18 and 46 ) .",
    "furthermore @xcite observed that the @xmath57li abundance is a factor of 3 smaller in star 21 than in star 18 .",
    "this is to be compared to our results in figure  [ fig : ab_teff13.5 ] . at the turnoff ,",
    "the li and fe abundances are sensitive functions of both the exact evolutionary state and turbulence . at 13.5 gyr , in 0.78 @xmath3 models without turbulence , the fe abundance is @xmath550.05 dex from normal .",
    "introducing the t5.5 turbulence model reduces it by 0.25 dex while the t6.09 model brings it back to @xmath550.1 dex from normal .",
    "as may be seen in figure [ fig : life_teff ] , the fe abundance as a function of @xmath6 has a complex loop structure around the turnoff in both 0.8 and 0.78 @xmath3 stars .",
    "small changes in evolutionary state and/or turbulence can change the fe abundance by 0.2@xmath550.3 dex and the @xmath57li abundance by 0.5@xmath550.6 dex . at the turnoff , the different li and fe abundances",
    "would then be explained by a different turbulence between the stars , resolving the difficulty described in section 4.2 of @xcite .",
    "they would become the pop ii analogue of amfm stars .",
    "however all three of those stars appear to be past the turnoff . as figure",
    "[ fig : life_teff ] shows , the @xmath4 have significant effects on surface abundances in stars of mass 0.77 @xmath3 and more but , for fe , these effects are limited to @xmath64 k. as seen in figure [ fig : ab_z_teff ] , the abundance variations at the turnoff are not expected in subgiants when they reach 6020 k. at this temperature , reducing turbulence leads to more gravitational settling for both li and fe which can not explain the differences between stars 18 and 21 . while turnoff stars of a cluster could have abundance variations as observed for stars 18 , 21 and 46 ,",
    "these are not expected in stars with exactly the parameters determined for them  and this is a difficulty even if there appears to be considerable uncertainty in the @xmath6 of stars in this cluster ( compare the @xmath6 of @xcite to those of @xcite and the discussion in section 4.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the comparison to our evolutionary models , it is the absolute @xmath6 scale that matters and not just the @xmath6 with respect to the turnoff @xmath6 . if anomalies are confirmed , agreement with our model would require the higher @xmath6 scale for m92 .",
    "it has been clearly shown that , contrary to the belief expressed in many papers and recently by @xcite , atomic diffusion does not necessarily lead to underabundances of metals in pop ii stars .",
    "differential radiative accelerations lead to overabundances of fe and some other chemical elements in some turnoff stars .",
    "consider the evolution of pop ii stars with no tubulence .",
    "as one may see by considering the solid curves in figures  [ fig : ab_teff12 ] and [ fig : ab_teff13.5 ] , generalized underabundances by 0.1 dex are expected in the @xmath6 interval from 4600 to 5500 . between 5500 and 6000 ,",
    "the underabundances are still generalized and increase to 0.3 dex for some species such as . in 12 gyr turnoff stars however ( @xmath67 ) , overabundances by a factor of up to 10 are possible ( e.g. al and ni ) .",
    "all calculated species heavier than na may have overabundances . at a given @xmath6 ,",
    "variations are expected from star to star . at 13.5 gyr ,",
    "similar but smaller anomalies are expected .",
    "the overabundances are sensitive to any left over turbulence below the convection zone .    in this paper ,",
    "the evolution of stars with @xmath21 has been described both with and without turbulence .",
    "a 0.1 dex underabundance of metals in turnoff stars as compared to giants has been shown to be the smallest anomaly to be expected ( section [ sec : ab_teff ] ) .",
    "star to star variations were seen to be possible around the turnoff , if turbulence is small enough .",
    "observations ( see section [ sec : observations ] ) suggest the presence of abundance variations similar to those expected .",
    "the comparison to observations is , however , sensitive to the @xmath6 scale .",
    "as @xcite concluded at the end of their section 4.2 , higher quality data is probably required to establish the reality of fe abundance variations within m92 .",
    "the accurate determination of the abundance of more species is also needed .",
    "this may well have implications not only for intrinsic abundance variations in clusters but for internal stellar structure .",
    "the effect of varying @xmath34 on the evolution of pop ii stars will be investigated in a forthcoming paper , ( paper iii ) , where comparisons to higher @xmath34 clusters will be undertaken .",
    "increasing @xmath34 in pop ii stars will be shown to reduce considerably the expected abundance anomalies .",
    "note also that paper ii shows that the present models for @xmath7_0 = -1.31 $ ] accurately reproduce the cmd locations of local population ii subdwarfs having hipparcos parallaxes and metallicities within + /@xmath55 0.2 dex of @xmath7 = -1.3 $ ] .    in a number of clusters with higher",
    "@xmath34 than m92 , observations suggest that only small variations , if any , are present in turnoff stars ( see for instance @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) . furthermore in field halo stars , the li abundance puts strict constraints on any chemical separation . in the companion paper ( paper ii )",
    "we therefore took the cautious approach to use mainly evolutionary models that minimize the effect of atomic diffusion .",
    "it has been shown that the use , in complete stellar evolution models , of a relatively simple parametrization of turbulent transport leads to li surface abundances compatible with the li plateau observed in field halo stars ( with a 0.17 dex reduction from the original li abundance ) and small variations in the surface abundances of metals ( a 0.1 dex reduction of the metal abundance in turnoff stars as compared to that in giants in clusters with @xmath21 ) . at the same time",
    ", the gravitational settling of he leads to a reduction in the age of globular clusters by some 10% ( see paper ii ) .",
    "however simple the parametrization of turbulent transport , it is not understood from first principles .",
    "the high level of constancy of li abundance as a function of @xmath6 requires that turbulence mixes to very nearly the same @xmath38 throughout the star evolution and in stars covering a mass interval of approximately 0.6 to 0.8 @xmath3 .",
    "as already noted by @xcite , this is not expected in standard stellar models .",
    "no convincing hydrodynamic model has been proposed that explains this property .",
    "pop ii stars appear to tell us that this is the case , however .",
    "mass loss is another physical process that could compete with atomic diffusion and maintain a constant value of li as a function of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "whether , in the absence of turbulent transport , it could be made consistent with the observations of metals in globular cluster turnoff stars is a question that requires further calculations .",

    "<S> i stars where only a fraction of stars , such as amfm stars , have abundance anomalies , one should look for the possibility of abundance anomalies of metals in some pop ii turnoff stars , and not necessarily in all . expected abundance anomalies are calculated for 28 species and compared to observations of m92 as well as to li observations in halo field stars . </S>"
