    "supersymmetric generalization of the sm permits one to solve some inner problems of the theory .",
    "however , the mssm is an ambiguous model : despite the defined set of physical fields , only one characteristic mssm parameter ",
    "electroweak scale @xmath1  has been fixed in experiment .",
    "the scales of scalar quarks and leptons @xmath2 , gaugino @xmath3 , and higgsino @xmath4 , can be picked out as arbitrary ones .",
    "expectations of new dynamical effects of the supersymmetry at the lhc are induced in the mssm by some specific choice of the susy breaking scale that is not very far from the ew scale , @xmath5 .",
    "this scale hierarchy seems `` natural '' , providing regularization of quadratic divergencies long before @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the mssm as it is motivated by some theoretical and phenomenological arguments  successful rg evolution , `` natural ''  choice of the renormalization scale and the reasonable dark matter ( dm ) description  works well for the specific choice of the susy breaking scale only .",
    "however , the `` naturalness ''  as one of the mssm principles does not seem to be the obligatory requirement from the qft point of view .",
    "so establishing of the genuine susy scales hierarchy is a problem which can be unambiguously solved beyond the mssm .",
    "the arbitrariness in the choice of the scale hierarchy can be sufficiently diminished when the gauge coupling unification is considered as the most fundamental theoretical basis . with this consideration as a starting point , we have found that the one - loop rg study , involving susy @xmath0 degrees of freedom placed near @xmath6 , allows one to select some specific classes of the scale hierarchies .",
    "the proton stability is provided simultaneously .",
    "it was shown that states near @xmath6 should be taken into account as threshold corrections ; they are crucially important for the selection of scales , giving sufficiently high unification point",
    ". then the rg consideration at the one - loop level results in two classes of scenarios with an opposite arrangement of @xmath4 and @xmath3 scales . at the same time",
    ", the analysis does not fix the characteristic scalar scale @xmath2 due to a specific form of the rg equations which contain the squark and slepton scales as a ratio @xmath7 only .    for the first class of scenarios the hierarchy @xmath8 takes place .",
    "the second class is defined by the hierarchy @xmath9 . due to arbitrariness of @xmath2 it",
    "is possible to select some subscenarios with various @xmath2 arrangements . among them",
    "there can be found some hierarchies corresponding to split symmetry and some ideologically close scenarios which do not reject fine - tuning and are motivated , on the one hand , by the anthropic principle and , on the other hand , multi - vacua string landscape arguments  @xcite ( see , however , comments in  @xcite ) .    in particular , the rg analysis results in the hierarchy @xmath10 whose spectrum contains two lightest neutralinos degenerated in mass ( almost pure higgsino ) and one of charginos as the states that are the nearest to the electroweak scale . in this split higgsino scenario",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are shifted to scales @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider some features and manifestations of the last scenario only ( a preliminary version of this work was presented in  @xcite , see also  @xcite ) .    as it will be shown , direct observation of neutralino ( higgsino ) in @xmath12 scattering is impossible nowadays due to a very small interaction cross section .",
    "as to collider experiments , the signature of neutralino and chargino production and decays at the lhc crucially depends on the mass splitting values for these degenerate states  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , observation of these hardly detectable effects means that it is possible to get important information on the high superstate structure , in particular , @xmath13 and their mixing , from one - loop calculations of the mass splitting  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if only these low - lying susy degrees of freedom are detected in experiments near a tev scale , the conventional mssm spectrum should necessarily be splitted in some manner to produce a high scale for other superstates .",
    "the value predicted for the diffuse gamma flux from the galactic halo can be measured by glast or act in the near future but it is not peculiar to this scenario .",
    "signals from direct photons do not contain any specific effects too  @xcite .",
    "thus , the split higgsino scenario is an example of susy models , in which the lightest degrees of freedom manifest themselves in some subtle effects as specific decay channels , correlating with the value of diffuse ( or direct ) gamma flux .",
    "note , even if collider experiments will demonstrate the absence of the lowest neutralino signals ( due to a high degeneracy of states , for example , it will certainly testify to some fine - tuning in the susy states spectrum ) , the susy , as a theoretical principle , can not be rejected . at low @xmath14 energies",
    "the susy , in a sense , is barely hidden , so it exists at a high scale .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss rg analysis of the susy @xmath0 in detail , indicating the most interesting scenarios . in section 3 ,",
    "the lagrangian of the split higgsino model and its analysis are presented .",
    "there is also an estimation of the lowest higgsino mass from the relic abundance data .",
    "we discuss expected experimental manifestations of the scenario in section 4 and some conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "we consider one - loop rg equations for running couplings and start from their values at the @xmath15 scale @xmath16 in renormgroup equations the following values are used as initial : @xmath17 at the one - loop level the equations for running couplings are well - known @xmath18 in the sum all states with masses @xmath19 at @xmath20 are taken into account .",
    "namely , we include in the rg analysis the following degrees of freedom : singlet quarks and their superpartners @xmath21 contained in super - higgs quintets of susy @xmath0 ; chiral superfields @xmath22 and @xmath23 in adjoint representations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , which survive from super higgs 24-plet . in the minimal susy @xmath0 masses of the states @xmath26 are generated by an interaction with higgs condensate at the gut scale , but the interaction couplings are not fixed . for the analysis",
    "we assume masses @xmath27 to be slightly lower than @xmath28 .",
    "note that heavy states near @xmath6 are of especial importance for the rg equations .",
    "the necessity of taking into account of such heavy states in the rg analysis as so - called threshold corrections is well - known  @xcite .",
    "for one - loop running couplings at the scale @xmath29 we have @xmath30 here @xmath31 are masses of scalar quarks and leptons averaged over chiralities and generations ; @xmath32 is @xmath33-quark mass ; other parameters were introduced above . in ( [ gut ] )",
    "it is supposed that the lightest higgs boson mass @xmath34 is near to @xmath1 and other higgs bosons @xmath35 are placed at some high @xmath36 scale . for extra heavy states the only condition is @xmath37 and we suppose that this inequality is fulfilled with accuracy within 1 - 2 orders of magnitude . as to susy degrees of freedom @xmath38 , equations ( [ gut ] ) do not depend on any specific arrangement of these scales .",
    "so when @xmath6 is the highest scale in the system , there is no necessity to establish an initial scale hierarchy .",
    "the only demand is that the rg equations should lead to coupling unification at sufficiently high @xmath6 scale for the proton stability .",
    "then the set of possible hierarchies of energy scales arises as the final result of the study .",
    "note also that if masses of singlet superstates and residual higgs superfields are equal to @xmath6 , equations ( [ gut ] ) return to the standard form automatically .",
    "the above considerations together with experimental restrictions on the susy mass spectrum and general expectation of the lightest higgs boson scale ( it is not very far from the ew scale ) are sufficient for the rg analysis .    as the first step",
    ", all couplings were recalculated at the @xmath39 scale , all the sm states contribute to running of couplings despite @xmath40 , higgs bosons , and @xmath33-quark . at the same time , terms with @xmath41 occur which are quantitatively important for calculations . between the @xmath42 scales the following states",
    "emerge : @xmath40 and one higgs doublet containing light @xmath43-boson and longitudinal degrees of freedom of @xmath40 . at these stages",
    ", @xmath44 vertex was used for calculations of @xmath45 , starting from @xmath46 value . above @xmath47 calculations",
    "were carried out in a standard manner .",
    "now , equating couplings at @xmath6 , from ( [ gut ] ) we get the following expressions : @xmath48 where @xmath49    @xmath50    here all dimensionless parameters @xmath51 with various indices are defined as quantities having values larger than unity ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 are not under theoretical control either in the mssm or in the susy @xmath0 .",
    "so we assume that @xmath53 .",
    "for the lightest higgs boson there is an experimental restriction @xcite : @xmath54 , as to other ( heavy ) higgs bosons the following interval @xmath55 is supposed for the numerical analysis .",
    "values of @xmath56 can be determined from the renormgroup evolution from @xmath6 to @xmath57 . here",
    "we suppose that @xmath58 . now all dimensionless parameters are fixed in some intervals and we analyze @xmath59 and @xmath4 as functions of @xmath6 : @xmath60    as it is seen",
    ", the initial system of equations for three running couplings can be rewritten as a system of two equations for the effective gaugino @xmath59 and @xmath4 scales , depending on @xmath6 .",
    "it is very essential that all other characteristic scales arise in the equations as dimensionless ratios only .",
    "( this method of rg analysis was used in  @xcite for investigation of susy @xmath0 and @xmath61 energy scale hierarchies ; see also  @xcite . )    as an important feature , we have to note that the renormgroup study remains a common scalar scale @xmath2 as an arbitrary one : the scale @xmath2 turns into ( [ 6 ] ) through the ratio @xmath62 only . for numerical predictions",
    "the ratio value was estimated as @xmath63 .",
    "certainly , the splitting of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 scales will affect the hierarchies of other scales . however , to change these hierarchies crucially , the ratio @xmath66 must be @xmath67 or larger , and here we do not consider this possibility .",
    "also , we suppose that radiative corrections to superscalar masses do not change the ratio substantially ( numerically , these corrections can be as large as @xmath68 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "conclude , the scale @xmath2 should be fixed by some extra arguments independently",
    ".    contributions of heavy states @xmath69 do not affect the rg hierarchy of susy scales radically because their scales are combined into a ratio too .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio value is important to fix the @xmath6 scale : the ratio @xmath70 depends on @xmath15 logarithmically , so numerical coefficients of the ratio can change the @xmath6 value .    for the analysis we used the known restrictions for the proton lifetime @xmath71 at @xmath72 and for @xmath73 that is @xmath74 when @xmath75 .",
    "we hope also that loop corrections to all masses in the model do not change results of the rg analysis drastically , it is supposed that for the scenario they contribute no more than @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "=    numerical results following from ( [ 6 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the proposed method of the one - loop rg analysis results in the selection of two proper sets of susy scales only ( further we will omit differences between @xmath59 and @xmath3 ) . for this conclusion",
    "we assume that the characteristic @xmath4 scale is in the @xmath77 region , providing the neutralino mass value that is sufficient for explanation of the dm properties .",
    "the first class of scenarios is defined by the hierarchy @xmath78 as it was noted , @xmath2 value does not affect this scale splitting dictated by the one - loop rg evolution , and can be placed at an arbitrary but physically reasonable scale .",
    "so the class could be divided into some subscenarios with hierarchies @xmath79 the subscenarios ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are close to the known split susy ( gaugino ) models  @xcite , but the variant ( d ) , keeping most part of the susy degrees of freedom ( except higgsino ) near the ew scale , is similar to the mssm spectrum with `` naturalness '' .",
    "for these variants we get @xmath80 and gaugino masses can be as small as @xmath81 .",
    "the second set of scenarios is generated by the hierarchy @xmath82 in this set we have the following subscenarios : @xmath83    except the last variant ( h ) with too low @xmath2 scale as contradicting known experimental data , the other scenarios of this class seem reasonable .",
    "all of them introduce higgsino as the dm carrier .",
    "note that the hierarchy ( f ) is close to the mssm spectrum again , despite gaugino states at a high scale .",
    "scenarios ( e ) and ( g ) shift @xmath2 and @xmath3 scales into a multi - tev region , splitting the spectrum . in these cases , the @xmath4 scale is the nearest to the ew scale and should be near @xmath84 , as it follows from the rg analysis .",
    "as to the unification scale , we have the value @xmath85 which makes the proton stable .    obviously , split susy models with high @xmath2 and @xmath3 scales lead to the damping of heavy states ( squarks , sleptons ) contributions near the ew scale .",
    "another important consequence of this type of scenarios is ( nearly ) degeneration in mass of the lowest neutralino and chargino states  @xcite ( experimental searches of this degenerated states were carried out at lep energies  @xcite without any evident signals ) .",
    "further , we will consider the split higgsino scenario with hierarchy @xmath86    taking @xmath6 value as @xmath87 , for @xmath88 the susy breaking scale is @xmath89 ; when @xmath90 we get @xmath91 . for these cases @xmath92 .",
    "the used values of @xmath4 , as it will be seen further , agree with modern data on relic dm abundance .",
    "intervals of @xmath73 values follow mainly from uncertainties in the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "most evidently , the scenario is selected when @xmath95 ; it means that the effect of threshold corrections is essentially important for the discovery of hierarchy .",
    "namely , if masses @xmath69 are equal to @xmath6 , it is questionable to select several possible scenarios that are compatible with the dm data .",
    "these one - loop results should be refined with taking into account of two - loop @xmath96-functions and loop corrections to masses .",
    "by now we expect that two - loop rg analysis does not change the above hierarchies radically as well as mass corrections",
    ". certainly , various numerical coefficients will change , arrangements of the scales will move somehow , but the relative spacing between @xmath4 and @xmath3 scales will not change , as we hope",
    ". nevertheless , the @xmath2 scale can be splitted by the rg at the two - loop level , so positions of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 scales can be determined independently . more carefully",
    "this question will be analyzed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "now we will consider the lagrangian of the split higgsino scenario , its structure , and features .",
    "when the group of symmetry is fixed , the lagrangian as a local gauge group invariant can be written in a standard manner . nevertheless , its specific form depends on the chosen field representation . in this paper",
    ", we use the formalism of majorana spinors and define all physical fields as having positive masses only .",
    "more precisely , in the scenario considered the neutralino mixing parameter is proportional to the ratio @xmath97 , so it is negligibly small due to a high scale of susy breaking . however , the mixing can be important when the model restrictions are analyzed in the framework of a specific mass spectrum with a small splitting of the lightest neutralino masses .    as to neutralino masses ,",
    "i.e. , the scale of @xmath4 parameter , diagonalization of the neutralino mass matrix by an orthogonal matrix usually leads to emerging of neutralino state with negative mass .",
    "this should be taken into account in calculations by the corresponding definition of the propagator ( if negative mass neutralino is in the intermediate state ) or in the neutralino polarization matrix ( if the neutralino is in the initial or in the final state ) . to evade this inconvenience , we redefine the neutralino field with the negative mass in the following way :",
    "this operation provides positive neutralino mass keeping standard calculation rules simultaneously .",
    "moreover , it does not change majorana type of the field .",
    "it also has been shown that this procedure is equivalent to the diagonalization by the unitary matrix instead of the orthogonal one , for details see  @xcite",
    ".    hence , in the scenario two lowest neutralino states are majorana higgsino - like ones .",
    "the set of scales leads to the strong splitting in the neutralino and chargino spectra , so masses of these lightest neutralinos @xmath99 and the light chargino @xmath100 emerge near the @xmath4 scale .",
    "light neutralino states are built from the initial fields @xmath101 in the limit of pure higgsino when @xmath102 and @xmath103 ; here @xmath104 .",
    "masses of the lightest states are @xmath105    it is seen that the spectrum of the lowest states , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , is nearly degenerated . for the higgsino dm",
    "this fact is known ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "two other neutralino states , @xmath106 , and heavy chargino @xmath107 are placed far from the lightest ones , near the high scale @xmath73 .",
    "the initial lagrangian of @xmath108 interactions , including the @xmath4-term , is the following ( for more details see  @xcite ) @xmath109 taking into account that @xmath110 from ( [ l1 ] ) in the limit of pure neutral higgsino it follows : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the dirac neutral field and @xmath113 . when the field @xmath114 is expressed through majorana fields @xmath115 and @xmath116 as @xmath117 for the transition @xmath118 we get @xmath119    all processes near the ew scale are described by the sm lagrangian together with extra lagrangian of the higgsino interactions with photons and vector bosons : @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the lowest chargino state , @xmath122 .",
    "remember that @xmath99 states are the majorana spinors and chargino @xmath121 is the dirac spinor .    in the above lagrangian",
    "the vertices are considered in the limit of zero mixing , because contributions to the vertices induced by a mixing are of an order of @xmath97 .",
    "so corrections induced by mixing are negligibly small and can be omitted .",
    "however , the same small mixing contributions to the particle mass spectrum should be involved into analysis .",
    "the reason is that the decay widths depend on the mass splitting crucially .      supposing that the lightest higgsino - like neutralino is a carrier of the dm in the universe , we evaluate its mass from the dm relic abundance .    in accordance with the known method for the relic abundance calculation ( see , for example ,  @xcite and  @xcite with references therein ) before freeze - out neutralinos are in the thermodynamical equilibrium with other components of the cosmological plasma .",
    "relic is formed by the irreversible annihilation process  from the moment , when the freeze - out is reached , up to the present day when temperature is approximately equal to absolute zero ( this approximation is sufficient for the case ) . with the standard estimation of @xmath123 the value of @xmath124 can be well above @xmath125 only if @xmath126 .",
    "now , if the lowest higgsino masses were well above @xmath127 , the irreversible annihilation process could start before electro - weak phase transition ( it is considered as the first order phase transition ) in the high - symmetric phase of the cosmological plasma .",
    "then the plasma does not contain any higgs condensate , and all standard particles , except higgsino , are massless ( more exactly , their masses @xmath128 ) .    in the ordinary low - symmetric case , the neutralino annihilation cross section is calculated with the lagrangian ( [ lh ] ) . in relic calculations all possible coannihilation channels",
    "were taken into account ( there is no coannihilation with squarks and/or sleptons ) , namely @xmath129 \\displaystyle \\chi _ c\\bar \\chi_c \\,\\,\\rightarrow zz,\\quad w^+w^- , \\quad f \\bar f , \\quad \\gamma \\gamma,\\quad zh \\\\[3 mm ] \\displaystyle \\chi_{\\alpha } \\bar \\chi_c \\,\\,\\rightarrow zw , \\quad l \\nu_l , \\quad q_i \\bar q_j , \\quad\\gamma w,\\quad wh , \\end{array } \\label{coann}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 denote the lowest neutralino states .    in the scenario the effective neutralino annihilation cross section is : @xmath131 \\displaystyle \\left . \\frac{1}{2\\",

    "we use known values of the above parameters and extract the following lsp ( higgsino ) mass : @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "these values do not spoil the gauge coupling convergence and are in agreement with the results from  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the model where two lightest neutralinos and one chargino are the closest to the ew scale having masses @xmath139 .",
    "further , we will use @xmath140 for all numerical estimations as an average value .    to answer whether the neutralino annihilation process can start in the high - symmetric phase ,",
    "we calculate the annihilation cross section with the lagrangian which contains physical states presented by chiral fermions and gauge fields @xmath141 . due to the absence of the higgs condensate neutralino and chargino degrees of freedom",
    "join into the fundamental @xmath24 representation , i.e. , dirac field @xmath142 .",
    "all states of this field are dynamically equivalent and correspond to quantum numbers of the restored ( unbroken ) @xmath24 symmetry .    in t- and",
    "s - channels all cross sections of higgsino annihilation into gauge bosons and massless fermions were calculated analogously to the qcd calculation technology .",
    "the only difference is that it is necessary to consider all channels with initial and final states which have an arbitrary color in two dimensions , corresponding to the restored @xmath24 symmetry . calculating the total neutralino annihilation cross section , from the known corridor of the relic abundance values we get the lowest higgsino mass @xmath143 again . it contradicts the initial supposition that @xmath144 to provide freeze - out temperature higher than the ew phase transition temperature .",
    "so in the framework of orthodox notions ( mechanisms of extra entropy production or superheavy states decays , etc",
    ". are not considered ) this scenario does not allow the dm to be created in the high symmetric phase .",
    "it is important to understand how an experimental study of the split higgsino scenario can be realized .",
    "here we discuss some possibilities that can be given by neutralino - nucleon scattering processes , collider experiments with susy particles creation and the data on photon spectrum from neutralino annihilation .",
    "the last one will be considered in the next subsection .",
    "an experimental observation of the scenario manifestations depends on neutralino mass splitting parameters @xmath145 and @xmath146 crucially .",
    "these splittings are determined by the sum of tree splittings and radiative corrections to masses .",
    "depending on the @xmath2 spacing and structure of high energy states , loop corrections can be comparable with tree values of @xmath147 ( @xmath148 or @xmath149 ) or even exceed them  @xcite .",
    "as it is known  @xcite , the hierarchy of @xmath150 and @xmath151 states and their mixing angle @xmath152 drive the value of the mass difference when squarks dominate in loops @xmath153 due to these ( large ) corrections the mass splittings can be increased up to @xmath154  @xcite .",
    "then let us consider two possible variants .",
    "firstly , let there be large mass splittings @xmath155 or even larger .",
    "when this is the case , the lowest higgsino and chargino states can be detected at the lhc , in particular , due to specific decay channels of @xmath156 and @xmath121  the corresponding analysis was considered in some detail in  @xcite , so we do not repeat it here . in the split higgsino hierarchy @xmath157 , squarks ( sleptons ) slip out of the lhc experiment ( together with the high energy gaugino ) , keeping specific chargino ( neutralino ) decays as the observable only .    if , however , @xmath158 , there are two additional possibilities .",
    "namely , if @xmath159 , i.e. , squarks ( sleptons ) have masses @xmath160 , an occasion arises to observe their signals at the lhc .",
    "( if @xmath161 and/or @xmath162 are sufficiently close to the lowest neutralino mass , some coannihilation contribution to the effective neutralino annihilation cross section is produced . ) when @xmath163 there are no observable effects of squarks ( sleptons ) at the lhc scale .",
    "both of these last subscenarios are very peculiar due to a large splitting between @xmath3 and @xmath2  it can produce relatively long - lived superscalars at tev ( or higher ) scale .",
    "in this case , specific manifestations of these states both at colliders ( long - lived squarks and /or sleptons , changes in their decay modes hierarchy etc . ) , and in neutralino - nucleon scattering ( large contribution to si interaction ) should be . in this paper , however , we concentrate only on the scenario with @xmath164 where superscalars are very heavy .",
    "neutralino - nucleon interaction in the scenario behaves as a threshold process due to the formalism accepted  the corresponding term in the lagrangian is nondiagonal in neutralino fields : @xmath165 . in the case of pure neutralino states ,",
    "zero order contributions to @xmath166 interaction correspond to the spin - independent ( si ) inelastic process .",
    "this conclusion results from the interaction lagrangian ",
    "nondiagonal higgsino current @xmath167 interacts with @xmath168 as a vector , rather than an axial vector , it is a consequence of the real 4-dimensional majorana formalism used ( see  @xcite ) .    at the tree level",
    "the zero order si cross section for @xmath169 reaction takes the following threshold form @xmath170 in the non - relativistic case @xmath171 where @xmath172 is an average kinetic energy of the neutralino in the sun neighborhood , @xmath173 . for @xmath174 this energy @xmath175 so for @xmath148 as large as @xmath176 the threshold value for the reaction energy is unattainable",
    ". then the process is forbidden , and cosmic neutralinos can not be detected in the direct terrestrial experiments .",
    "the cross section for the neutralino - nucleon scattering with chargino production ( recharge process ) is similar to ( [ del ] ) and for large @xmath177 this channel is also closed .",
    "corrections induced by a nonzero mixing and/or loop diagrams can not make these nondiagonal reactions visible because part of correction amplitudes is damped in the limit of pure higgsino ; contributions from squark exchanges are small due to large squark masses ( see also  @xcite ) . furthermore , due to majorana nature of neutralino , nonzero loop contributions are proportional to the small parameter @xmath178 . as concerns elastic ( diagonal ) channels , they contribute to the @xmath12 cross section via loops or due to a nonzero mixing , so their yield is small as well .",
    "returning to some rg arguments , it seems that when @xmath179 we can expect @xmath147 somewhat lower than for the case @xmath180 when the splitting between @xmath150 and @xmath151 can be larger .",
    "certainly , the relative splitting and mixing of these states are really unknown .",
    "so let us consider the second case with @xmath181 and it can be as low as @xmath182 if mass splittings are mainly determined by tree contributions . as to collider signature , in this case only photon , neutrino pair or low energy @xmath183 pairs can be created in the final states , but it is hard to select these events from the background ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "so in the case of low @xmath147 , degenerated higgsino and chargino are indeed invisible at the lhc .",
    "the higgsino - nucleon nondiagonal interaction takes place again in this case , contributing to the si cross section . comparing the model predictions for @xmath12 reaction with experimental restrictions on the si cross section  @xcite it is possible to estimate the @xmath73 value . from the inequality",
    "@xmath184 it follows that the process @xmath185 is closed when @xmath186 and @xmath187 for @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "these estimations depend on @xmath190 weakly and are in agreement with the ones given by the rg analysis .",
    "so we conclude that in this scenario the si inelastic higgsino - nucleon scattering can not be observed experimentally today .",
    "it seems that the inverse inelastic reaction @xmath191 is possible , but @xmath156 states are unstable , so they decayed a long time ago . in other words ,",
    "the only inequality @xmath192 takes place , where @xmath193 is the age of the universe .",
    "an upper estimation for @xmath194 follows from the width @xmath195 ( when @xmath196 is reasonably small we consider only the most `` soft '' channel ) and we have @xmath197 then the following restriction emerges @xmath198 with the value @xmath199 we get @xmath200 .",
    "it is again in accordance with the rg results and slightly more stringent than the restrictions following from the threshold inequality @xmath201 .",
    "electroweak corrections to the splitting @xmath202 can be as small as @xmath203 due to loops with @xmath204 and @xmath205  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath206 ( squark loop contributions are too small ) , recharge process @xmath207 accompanied by a track of @xmath208 seems as possible due to very energetic neutralinos , but their cross section is strongly damped and the reaction is entirely exotic .",
    "so the recharge process can not be detected experimentally too .",
    "depending on mass splitting the chargino lifetime can be estimated in the following manner : from the channel @xmath209 we get @xmath210 but in the intermediate interval of @xmath211 there are also chargino decay channels with the final @xmath4 and @xmath212-meson .",
    "for these decays the corresponding formulae are more cumbersome , and we do not write them here . gathering all contributions , we get approximately @xmath213    thus , for both the cases  large or small @xmath147  the subscenarios of this class do not produce practically any visible signal in various channels of neutralino - nucleon scattering at modern measuring tools .    if @xmath147 values are sufficiently large , there is a chance to discover at the lhc some decay modes of the lowest neutralino and chargino states .",
    "moreover , if some specific squark ( slepton ) effects occur at low tev scale too , but gaugino manifestations are absent , it may correspond to the subscenario @xmath214 .",
    "the existence of specific neutralino - chargino decays together with the absence of other susy states at the tev scale can be understood in the framework of the subscenarios @xmath157 or @xmath215 .",
    "absence in an experiment of various decay modes manifestations can indicate that the subscenarios with @xmath157 or @xmath215 are realized , providing the lowest neutralino and chargino with a well degenerate spectrum that can not be observed in experiment .",
    "note , for all scenarios with a large splitting between @xmath3 and @xmath2 a large contribution to the si neutralino - nucleon cross section is possible due to the squark exchange , especially if the superscalar scale is closed to @xmath4 . naturally , a study of collider and @xmath12 data correlations is necessary , making details of the state spectrum more precise .",
    "data on neutralino annihilation photon spectrum are also needed to complete an analysis of capabilities of the scenarios .",
    "as it follows from above , in the split higgsino scenario obvious manifestations of susy can be in some latent form : direct interaction of neutralino with nuclei is too small and it is very questionable whether effects of degenerate neutralino and chargino can be detected at the lhc if @xmath216 .",
    "it seems that a chance to verify this scenario is to study the photon spectra from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo .",
    "the process can produce gamma quants in two ways : direct photon creation through loop diagrams or formation of a diffuse ( continuous ) gamma spectrum due to secondary photons created in radiative decays of mesons .    in this scenario",
    "the dominant mode of continuous gamma spectrum creation is higgsino annihilation into @xmath217 and @xmath218 bosons followed by creation and radiative decays of light mesons , mainly through the channel @xmath219 . for the lowest higgsino mass @xmath220 we calculate the cross section of higgsino annihilation into @xmath217 and @xmath218 and get @xmath221 .",
    "further , the same spectrum @xmath222 where @xmath223 , is used for both ( w and z ) channels approximately (  @xcite ) .",
    "then the total diffuse photon flux from halo can be calculated as @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the threshold photon energy for an apparatus , @xmath226 is the maximal registered photon energy , @xmath227 is averaged over angle value of the integral @xmath228 which contains information on the dm distribution in halo  @xcite .    fixing some value @xmath229 that is typical of the navarro - frenk - white profile , where @xmath230 is used ( see  @xcite ) , we evaluate the total continuous gamma flux that can be measured at space - based telescopes ( egret or glast ) or at ground based atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( act ) ( hess , in particular )",
    ". then from ( [ spectr ] ) for the total flux we get @xmath231 \\displaystyle   \\phi^{\\gamma}_{glast}\\,\\approx 0.19\\cdot 10^{-10}\\,cm^{-2}\\ , s^{-1 } , \\quad e_0=1\\ , \\mathrm{gev},\\,\\,e_m=300\\ , \\mathrm{gev } , \\\\[3 mm ] \\displaystyle   \\phi^{\\gamma}_{hess}\\;\\;\\approx 0.82\\cdot 10^{-12}\\,cm^{-2}\\ , s^{-1 } , \\quad e_0=60\\ , \\mathrm{gev},\\,\\,e_m=1\\ , \\mathrm{tev}. \\end{array } \\label{dat}\\ ] ] as it is seen , the calculated values are beyond experimental possibilities of these telescopes  at present , only glast has some chance to measure the total continuous gamma flux , because it can detect a gamma flux as small as @xmath232 . in the near future , however ,",
    "act like hess , for example , will be able to fix the flux due to high sensitivity level  @xcite @xmath233 .",
    "note also that similar results were derived in  @xcite for direct photon signals .",
    "a characteristic value of the flux is not characteristic feature of the scenario , nearly the same values arise in all schemes with highly degenerate higgsino as the lowest state . nevertheless , from comparison with other model predictions ( mssm , msugra , etc . , see , for example  @xcite ) we note that channel of neutralino annihilation into quarks increases the total flux up to one order of magnitude , so the flux could be well over the glast sensitivity threshold",
    ". then the split higgsino scenario prediction for the diffuse gamma flux can be discriminated from predictions of models where there is a large contribution of quark and/or higgs annihilation modes .",
    "nevertheless , some conclusion on the split higgsino scenario realizability can be made only from the whole data analysis , using @xmath12 scattering , collider experiments , and photon spectrum data together .",
    "we have pointed out that from the one - loop rg analysis of the susy @xmath0 theory there can be extracted a few sets of energy scales which are compatible with conventional ideas on the dm structure and manifestations .",
    "threshold corrections , induced by heavy states near @xmath6 ",
    "@xmath69 ,  are especially important for establishment of the hierarchies . due to a specific form of the rg equations the scalar scale @xmath2 remains arbitrary , and it occurs the variety of scenarios divided in the two classes : @xmath234 or @xmath235 .",
    "note also that the refined rg analysis with two - loop @xmath96-functions and mass spectrum improved by radiative corrections can make the energy scale set more precise .",
    "namely , the @xmath2 scale can be split to establish squark and slepton scales separately , while the energy scale hierarchies as two global classes should remain .      due to",
    "the degenerate mass spectrum of the lightest states in the model the coannihilation channels are essential for the effective annihilation cross section . with the calculated value of @xmath238 the relic abundance value is provided by the lowest higgsino mass in the interval @xmath239 .",
    "experimental observation of this scenario effects crucially depends on @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "if these differences are @xmath240 , products of @xmath156 and @xmath208 decays can be , in principle , detected at the lhc , for small splittings these decay modes are invisible . at the same time , if superscalars are close to the lowest higgsino scale , their specific manifestations are possible too .",
    "in particular , such squarks at a tev scale should increase significantly the si neutralino - nucleon cross section .",
    "heavy scalars from the hierarchy @xmath241 do not change the tree level @xmath12 cross section significantly .    even if there are signals from neutralino and /or chargino decays , they are hardly detected .",
    "despite these ( possible ) effects the split higgsino model is characterized by @xmath12 scattering with the small and therefore yet unregistered si cross section and some typical value of a continuous annihilation gamma flux . for small @xmath147 values",
    "the @xmath73 scale is evaluated as @xmath242 in agreement with the rg results leading to unobserved si @xmath12 scattering .",
    "conclude , to detect some footsteps of the scenario , it is necessary to analyze correlation of all collider data , @xmath243 cross section measurements and value of diffuse gamma flux from halo ( or direct photon spectrum ) .",
    "only a comparison of all measured characteristics could give some conclusions on the scenario realization . in a sense",
    ", this model presents a class of `` hidden susy '' scenarios which do not reject susy ideas and at the same time , can explain ( possible ) absence of obvious susy signals at the lhc .",
    "if , however , the neutralino annihilation induced continuous gamma flux is not detected at all , simultaneously with the absence of neutralino and chargino decay modes at the lhc , it will mean that the dm origin can not be understood in the mssm framework . then to explain the dm origin and properties there should be attracted some other sources , as gravitino , for example .",
