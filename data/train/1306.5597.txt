    "a brief version of these notes was a condensation of this document and posted as @xcite .",
    "this current document is actually our first writeup about this integrable system and aims to give more details without trying to be brief .",
    "we start with an extended abstract .",
    "the next section gives the background definitions .",
    "then we prove the results and set up everything in the simplest possible case , where distances matter : the circle in the manifold case and the two point graph @xmath43 in the discrete case . in an appendix",
    ", we place the system into the context of other known integrable systems .",
    "+ by deforming the dirac operator @xmath44 on a finite simple graph @xmath45 or riemannian manifold @xmath46 , using integrable hamiltonian systems @xmath47 $ ] with @xmath48 , we alter the exterior derivative @xmath49 , the distance in @xmath1 or @xmath2 and obtain a natural symmetry for the quantum mechanical system defined by @xmath31 on the graph @xmath1 or manifold @xmath2 .",
    "this nonlinear evolution @xmath33 can be used as a nonlinear alternative of the wave equation , if @xmath50 is nonzero . unlike the linear dirac wave equation , which is not affected by the nonlinear symmetry except for preparing the initial velocity of the wave , the nonlinear flow influences the geometry .",
    "if we allow the flow to become complex , that is with @xmath51 , then the nonlinear flow is asymptotically indistinguishable from the linear wave equation .",
    "mathematically , one can see this as follows : the wave equation is linear in a static space and even so we use the dirac operator @xmath31 to describe its solutions , only the laplacian @xmath52 matters in the linear case ; one can see this by making a taylor expansion of the explicit dalembert solution formulas which involve @xmath31 .",
    "but this situation changes with the nonlinear evolution : the dirac operator @xmath31 enters now the stage , despite the fact that many things remain the same : the spectrum of @xmath10 , the operator @xmath53 itself as well as the cohomology defined by the exterior derivative @xmath54 are not affected by the deformation .",
    "each of the traces @xmath55 defines an integral of motion and can be used as hamiltonians of the system @xmath56 .",
    "they are the noether invariants of the group actions . in the manifold case",
    ", @xmath57 is defined in a zeta - regularized form as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the dirac zeta function of the manifold . unlike the zeta function of the laplacian",
    ", the dirac zeta function can be analytically continued to the entire plane , at least for odd - dimensional manifolds ( for even dimensional manifolds , some poles of the laplace zeta function can remain ) .",
    "while classical quantum mechanics , expressed as the classical schrdinger equation @xmath60 on space does not change , since @xmath61 stays constant , relativistic quantum mechanics given by the dirac equation @xmath62 or the new nonlinear equation @xmath63 does evolve now with a time - dependent dirac operator .",
    "the deformation of the geometry has interesting effects , despite the fact that the operator @xmath22 does not move .",
    "the laplacian @xmath22 becomes the sum of a shrinking laplacian @xmath64 with respect to the new exterior derivative @xmath6 and an expanding potential @xmath65 .",
    "these two ingredients of the laplacian are real and commute for all @xmath50 and all @xmath11 .",
    "distances in the graph defined by the new dirac operator @xmath17 increases in all parameter directions when starting with the standard dirac operator @xmath66 given by the standard exterior derivative @xmath49 .",
    "independent of the direction in which we move , there is an  arrow of time \" given by the expansion : the symmetry can actually be used as  time \" and it really does not matter which direction is taken on the symmetry group starting from @xmath26 , the features of the time evolution are always the same .",
    "we verify that the mckean - singer formula @xmath67 holds for the nonlinear deformation in the graph case .",
    "but if @xmath21 is an eigenfunction of @xmath22 which is a fermion , then its new super partner @xmath27 of a fermion @xmath21 is no more a boson .",
    "while mathematical super symmetry @xcite and mckean - singer symmetry is still present , the super partner @xmath27 is an interaction state close to the fermionic subspace .",
    "assume we look at a fixed vector @xmath21 which is a fermion .",
    "the vector @xmath27 is already after a short time indistinguishable from being a fermion .",
    "the evolution has pushed it from the boson space @xmath68 close to the fermion space @xmath69 .",
    "while by the unitary nature of the evolution , @xmath70 and @xmath71 stay perpendicular at all times , the operators @xmath72 do not .",
    "finally , for any graph with at least one edge , the expansion of the connes pseudo metric defined by @xmath7 or the riemannian metric defined directly by the new laplacian @xmath73 features a fast inflationary initial growth , which then slows down exponentially .",
    "tuning of the coupling constants of the exterior derivative @xmath74 by changing the dirac operator to @xmath75 corresponds to choosing units on each @xmath40  brane \" and can lead to an evolution , where scales of hierarchies can emerge : the physics on the different p - forms can be drastically different after some time .",
    "the scaling factors do not change the symmetries of the spectrum since @xmath76 is still zero and because super symmetry still holds for @xmath52 .",
    "these features are independent of the hamiltonian @xmath77 and of the time direction .",
    "the only input is geometry , the initial graph or manifold .",
    "the nature of the hamiltonian system assures that the eigenvectors @xmath78 of @xmath22 are only perpendicular when @xmath26 , if @xmath21 is kept to be a fermion .",
    "of course @xmath79 would stay perpendicular and @xmath80 are always perpendicular . but @xmath72 will be more correlated now and @xmath28 is now far way from @xmath21 when using the wave equation with @xmath10 .",
    "it is the dirac operator @xmath31 or equivalently the dirac wave evolution @xmath81 which measures distances .",
    "now @xmath10 changes and instead of @xmath81 or @xmath82 we propose to look at @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath10 converges to @xmath83 , this is for larger @xmath11 very close to the wave solution @xmath84 .",
    "it plays therefore also the role of the exponential map and parallel transport .",
    "+ since the hamiltonian system is a geometric evolution equation which alters geometry , it has the potential for the study the topology of graphs or manifolds .",
    "it is still unknown what the deformation means geometrically , when restricted to @xmath24-forms .",
    "both in the riemannian or graph case , we would like to know the evolution of curvature @xmath85 .",
    "curvature for graphs satisfying gauss - bonnet - chern can be extended to the manifold traced out by the wave equation .",
    "having @xmath85 represented as the expectation of the index @xmath86 $ ] on a probability space @xmath87 of functions @xmath21 on the space , the dynamics can be used to deform curvature as the push forward of the probability measure on @xmath87 under the evolution .",
    "we can therefore define curvature also for the deformed geometries and in the graph case extend it to the continuum defined by the dynamics .",
    "while the linear wave equation does not change curvature , the nonlinear flow will .",
    "the probabilistic representation of curvature as an average of index is also crucial to define curvature on each of the linear spaces defined by @xmath24-forms as well as their completions by the wave equation on which @xmath33 replaces the exponential map and parallel transport . + here is an other attempt to summarize the core mathematics : + the dirac deformation @xmath88 $ ] is completely integrable . on each invariant two - dimensional mckean singer plane spanned by @xmath20 with an eigenfunction @xmath21 of @xmath22",
    ", we can describe the motion of @xmath27 .",
    "each @xmath89 defines a new exterior derivative @xmath6 for which the cohomology is the same than for @xmath90",
    ". we can write @xmath91 as a sum of two commuting operators @xmath92 and @xmath93 . if @xmath94 , then @xmath95 is the euler characteristic for all @xmath11 . for nonzero @xmath50 ,",
    "the nonlinear evolution becomes asymptotic to a linear dirac transport equation @xmath96 which together with @xmath97 build solutions to the wave equation @xmath98 .",
    "while the nonlinear dirac deformation does not influence the schrdinger flow nor the classical linear wave evolutions , it is invisible for classical linear wave evolution on the graph or riemannian manifold , it becomes relevant if the dirac evolution @xmath99 is replaced by the new nonlinear evolution @xmath33 .",
    "+    lets add some more informal remarks , which are irrelevant for the rest .",
    "what does it mean that the super partner of @xmath21 are difficult to be seen after some time ?",
    "assume we have a fermion @xmath100 , then @xmath101 is a boson .",
    "now lets evolve time to get an operator @xmath10 .",
    "this means we have lost @xmath102 which allowed us to go from @xmath21 to @xmath101 . at time @xmath11 , it is @xmath10 or its geometric part @xmath17 which governs geometry at time @xmath11 determined by the wave equation .",
    "the deformed operators have changed the geometry and the partner @xmath103 is now expected further away .",
    "we can measure distances in the computer , it just involves linear algebra to measure the time a wave takes to get from @xmath21 to @xmath103 . if @xmath104 were evolved together , then of course , they stay perpendicular , but now both are neither fermion nor boson .",
    "the coordinate transformation which brings @xmath70 to the fermion space is not the same than the coordinate transformation which make @xmath71 a boson . unlike at @xmath26",
    ", we have a coordinate system in which the super partners are present but not * close enough * with the wave equation we have at hand at time @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , moving in the symmetry group of the geometric space has changed distances in such a way that initially close super partners are now more remote . +",
    "when working on a graph , we just need linear algebra and ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "all this has been implemented on the computer already and the results of this paper were mostly discovered first experimentally .",
    "the operator @xmath31 constructed from a finite graph is a finite matrix which the symmetry deforms with time .",
    "we can now make measurements at time @xmath11 by  looking around \" in the space by  sending light \" in different directions , using @xmath10 . sending a wave from one vertex to an other just needs to solve a linear system of equations to find the right initial velocity .",
    "the length of the initial velocity is inversely proportional to the distance .",
    "also @xmath24-forms evolve by the wave equation triggered by the operator @xmath10 .",
    "of course , real physics is several orders of magnitude more complicated than that and the above table should be understood as what it is : goofing around with objects and jargon from the standard model .",
    "but one can often learn from children stories . in any case , toying with  particle physics \" on a graph can be an educational laboratory for experimentation because we can for example look at how fast different  particles \" move in the time dependent space which is created by the collection of solution paths of the wave equation .",
    "since higher dimensional forms travel slower , they have more mass . in the discrete ,",
    "the only input is a graph .",
    "like in  schild s ladder \" which starts with _ in the beginning was a graph , more like diamond than graphite_. while the present article is mathematical , we believe that the physics could be interesting , at least as a play - field for experimentation and where the mathematics is not too complicated , using undergraduate concepts of linear algebra and differential equations only .",
    "there is almost no imput . only a graph .",
    "no forces , potentials or lagrangians have to be fed in .",
    "all the interactions appear when following the integrable deformation @xmath10 .",
    "there are many games one can play here .",
    "one possibility is to avoid looking at the vector space on which @xmath10 acts but take instead seriously the columns of the dirac operator itself .",
    "this also simplifies the concept even more .",
    "lets take for example a column @xmath21 in the second block of @xmath10 , which is a fermion column .",
    "now , @xmath105 is a @xmath106-form because @xmath107 is block diagonal .",
    "call @xmath108 the electromagnetic field and @xmath109 the current . since time is not part of the graph ,",
    "( it is implemented by the symmetry @xmath33 ) , the evolution @xmath10 determines a motion of the fields @xmath110 and currents @xmath111 . because @xmath10 asymptotically moves along the wave equation ,",
    "the fields behave , as physics demands it . now",
    "all the columns in the fermion block produce different fields at time @xmath11 , depending on the location on the graph .",
    "the manifold of all solutions of the wave equation which is a closed , compact submanifold of @xmath112 , can be equipped with a lorentzian structure bringing back the symmetries in the continuum .",
    "having reversed relativity and split time away from from space not only makes experimentation easier , it also keeps us in the  playground \" . otherwise , we would have to consider non - compact graphs or study global variational problems to select out suitable graphs as space - time and also deal with discrete time , which is much more difficult , in virtually all situations we have encountered in mathematics",
    "the later would not be impossible , because the euler characteristic of a graph is an interesting functional which at least for even - dimensional geometric graphs behaves very much like the hilbert action .",
    "it is a sum over all vertices and at every vertex a sum over all possible two - dimensional sectional curvatures , where all terms are defined graph theoretical .",
    "the reason for this are gauss - bonnet - chern @xcite and index results @xcite for graphs but the upshot is that euler curvature in the discrete has very much in common with scalar curvature at least conceptionally : ricci and scalar curvature can be written as an average over all sectional curvatures of planes passing through a line or point , euler curvature - the integrand in gauss - bonnet - chern- can be written as a more exotic average of all possible sectional curvatures through a point . for riemannian manifolds ,",
    "this has not yet been written down but if the analogy should go over , euler curvature of a point @xmath113 in an even dimensional riemannian manifold is the expectation value of curvature over all two dimensional embedded subsurfaces ( strings ) passing through @xmath113 or that euler curvature @xmath85 of a point @xmath113 in a riemannian manifold @xmath2 is the average of indices @xmath114 averaged over a probability morse functions @xmath21 on @xmath2 .",
    "the problem with proving this is to have a good probability space of all two dimensional submanifolds of a compact riemannian manifold or an intrinsic probability space of all morse functions on @xmath2 .",
    "( for the index averaging result , analysis similar to @xcite show that linear functions in an ambient flat euclidean space work to induce euler curvature ) .",
    "but if the surface curvature average interpretation is true too , we can think of euler characteristic ( the average of euler curvature ) as a quantized natural functional playing the role of the hilbert action ( the average of scalar curvature ) . in the graph case ,",
    "the mathematics is much easier and graphs with extremal euler characteristic should play a special role .",
    "the dirac operator @xmath0 for a finite simple graph @xmath45 or riemannian manifold @xmath46 encodes the geometry of a graph or manifold . in the graph case",
    ", @xmath115 contains all the information about the graph like in the manifold case where the operator @xmath116 determines the metric @xmath103 . the operator @xmath31 is defined by the exterior derivative @xmath49 on the geometry .",
    "we look here at isospectral integrable systems @xmath117\\ ] ] with @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a polynomial .",
    "any of these systems deform the operator @xmath31 and so @xmath49 but do not alter @xmath52 .",
    "the operator @xmath120 gains a block - diagonal part @xmath121 which leaves @xmath41-forms invariant and which leads to a decomposition @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "all these systems lead to deformations of the geometry because the new dirac operator @xmath17 can be used to define new distances .",
    "it is custom to rewrite such systems in a hamiltonian form @xmath125 . with",
    "@xmath126 $ ] and @xmath127 and hamiltonian @xmath128 , the system can then be rewritten as @xmath129 . this lax pair language and the corresponding hamiltonian formalism which comes with it , is common in",
    "virtually all known integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "the integrable system we consider here , is mathematically close to the toda lattice @xcite @xmath130 which is a discretisation of the korteweg de vries partial differential equation and which is an isospectral deformation @xmath131 $ ] of a jacobi matrix @xmath22 .",
    "the motion induces a volterra system @xmath132 for a dirac operator @xmath31 ( also jacobi but without diagonal part ) satisfying @xmath107 obtained by doubling the lattice .",
    "our system is different in that the laplacian @xmath22 does not move .",
    "only its square root @xmath31 moves and @xmath31 develops a block diagonal part @xmath133 which eventually dominates .",
    "still , much of the mathematics is related since both use the lax pair formalism @xcite .",
    "the toda system on a linear graph was integrated using scattering methods in @xcite . on a circular graph ,",
    "the toda system can be conjugated to a translation on a torus using algebro - geometric tools @xcite .",
    "there , the abel - jacobi map linearizes the motion of divisors given by the eigenvalues of an auxiliary spectral problem . for the deformation discussed in the present paper",
    ", we have in the real case a scattering situation and especially do not have recurrence .",
    "this makes the analysis easier .",
    "if the operator @xmath134 is replaced by @xmath135 , then @xmath10 still converges to the same block diagonal operator @xmath136 and @xmath137 converges to @xmath138 .",
    "the unitary flow @xmath33 satisfying @xmath139 consequently an attractor , on which the dynamics is a linear wave dynamics @xmath140 and almost periodic .",
    "+ how did we get to the system ?",
    "isospectral deformations of higher dimensional schrdinger operators are in general not possible by a rigidity result of mumford @xcite . while doing isospectral deformations of @xmath22 is no problem - any system @xmath141 $ ] with some antisymmetric @xmath142 allows to do that - , the corresponding unitary evolution does not have the property that @xmath22 stays a laplacian .",
    "in other words , if @xmath22 is a band matrix , then with such a naive deformation , @xmath143 is no more a band matrix in general for any @xmath144 .",
    "we have looked at this question in @xcite and seen that sufficient for a deformability is a factorization @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "factorization therefore is a condition which naturally leads to the deformation of the dirac operator @xmath31 because @xmath31 is the square root of the laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "having worked with the toda lattice before @xcite in an infinite dimensional setting , we would have expected at first a recurrent flow for @xmath10 in the case of graphs like the circular graph and scattering situation for the line graph . but this is not the case .",
    "the main features of the dynamical system is independent of the graph and the complex parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the later only determines whether @xmath145 and whether the limiting unitary flow @xmath146 is nontrivial or not . on the orthogonal complement of the kernel",
    ", the system decomposes into invariant two - dimensional planes . on these planes , a scattering motion takes place . when allowing a complex structure to evolve , that is if @xmath51 , we asymptotically get an almost periodic unitary flow .",
    "the analysis is essentially the same for graphs or for riemannian manifolds , even so in the later case , we have an infinite dimensional situation . on the technical side , we need analytic continuation of the zeta function to define the hamiltonian in the riemannian case , but we do not need to know the hamiltonian at all , to define the flow .",
    "the differential equations are defined as they are .",
    "still , dealing with the zeta function for the dirac operator is quite pleasant because unlike the zeta function of the laplacian , it can be chosen so that it has an analytic continuation onto the complex plane , at least for odd dimensional manifolds . for graphs ,",
    "the zeta function is of course always analytic everywhere .",
    "+ the deformed operators @xmath89 satisfy @xmath147 and @xmath148 , so that @xmath6 remains an exterior derivative .",
    "as we will see , the cohomology groups defined by the exterior derivative @xmath6 are preserved because cocycles or coboundaries get deformed by the differential equation @xmath149 . if @xmath150 , then also the mckean - singer formula @xmath151 holds .",
    "while it is not a direct consequence of super symmetry like in @xcite , it follows directly from the mckean - singer result . while the eigenvalues of @xmath10 still pair up as in the case @xmath26 , the corresponding eigenfunctions do no more honor the orthogonal decomposition into fermions and bosons .",
    "the deformation is of a scattering nature since the operators @xmath10 converge for @xmath36 to block diagonal operators @xmath152 preserving the linear spaces @xmath40 and which both satisfy @xmath153 .",
    "while each @xmath154 defines exterior derivatives @xmath6 , the operator @xmath155 converges to zero in the graph case .",
    "any deformation starting at the original @xmath31 increases therefore the connes pseudo distance between vertices .",
    "this happens initially with an inflationary fast start .",
    "while the deformation does not change the original operator , it does change a decomposition : more and more of the ",

    "it changes the relation between position @xmath157 and velocity @xmath158 solving the wave equation @xmath159 .",
    "a wave with a given initial frequency will later have a smaller frequency and will appear red shifted . since the decay of @xmath17 is asymptotically exponential , the amount of red shift will after some time be proportional to the distance traveled .",
    "+ the geometric evolution of @xmath10 is the same for riemannian manifolds or graphs",

    "<S> we give more details about an integrable system @xcite in which the dirac operator @xmath0 on a graph @xmath1 or manifold @xmath2 is deformed using a hamiltonian system @xmath3 $ ] with @xmath4 . the deformed operator </S>",

    "<S> the operator @xmath10 stays real for all @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath12 does not change , the new laplacian @xmath13 and the emerging potential @xmath14 do evolve . </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath15 are always real and commute . </S>",
    "<S> the cohomology defined by the deformed exterior derivative @xmath6 is the same as for @xmath16 as we can explicitly deform cocycles and coboundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the new dirac operator @xmath17 defines a new metric , so that the isospectral flow is an evolution which deforms the geometry as defined by zero forms . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath18 is the associated unitary , then the mckean - singer formula @xmath19 still holds . </S>",
    "<S> while super partners @xmath20 span the same plane at all times , observable super symmetry fades : if @xmath21 is an eigenvector of @xmath22 which is a fermion - an eigen-@xmath23-form of @xmath22 for some integer @xmath24 - then @xmath25 is only bosonic at @xmath26 and the angle between the fermionic subspace and @xmath27 goes to zero exponentially fast . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate system has changed so that the original superpartner @xmath28 is now far away for the new geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the linear relativistic wave equation @xmath29 and its solution @xmath30 with fixed @xmath31 is not affected by the symmetry since only @xmath22 and not @xmath31 enters in the solution formula . </S>",
    "<S> but the preperation of the initial velocity , the nonlinear solution @xmath32 of the wave equation with time dependent @xmath31 or the unitary evolution @xmath33 defined by the deformation depends on @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution has a geometric effect : with @xmath6 as a new exterior derivative , the property @xmath34 for @xmath35 implies that space expands , with a fast inflationary start . </S>",
    "<S> the inflation rate can be tuned by scaling @xmath31 . instead of solutions to the wave equation , the nonlinear evolution has more soliton - and particle - like solutions which feature interaction with adjacent forms . in the limit @xmath36 , </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath31 becomes block diagonal @xmath37 with @xmath38 , leading to linear solutions @xmath39 of the wave equation which leaves each space @xmath40 of @xmath41-forms invariant . for @xmath42 , </S>",
    "<S> explicit formulas illustrate the inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we also look at the circle case , where already the 0-form and 1-form spaces can be joint by solutions of the wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear dirac wave equation uses the entire geometric space but asymptotically , we get linear wave equation which preserve each p - form subspace and which is relativistic quantum mechanics and classical riemannian geometry . </S>",
    "<S> geometry alone can lead to interesting nonlinear wave dynamics , the emergence of new dimensions , complex structures , inflation and to a geometric toy model featuring riemannian or graph geometry in which super symmetry is present but difficult to measure . </S>"
