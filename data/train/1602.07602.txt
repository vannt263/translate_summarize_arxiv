    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) involves the generation of a shared secret key between two parties via quantum signal transmission [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .",
    "( among other possible terms , we will often use the more appropriate  generation \" in lieu of  distribution , \" ignoring their fine distinction in conventional cryptography [ 3 ] . ) qkd is widely perceived to have been proved secure in various protocols [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , in contrast to the lack of security proofs for conventional methods of encryption for privacy or key distribution. security proofs in qkd are highly technical and are also multi - disciplinary in nature , as is the case with the subject area of quantum cryptography itself .",
    "theoretical qkd involves in its description and treatment various areas in quantum physics , information theory , and cryptography at an abstract and conceptual level .",
    "it is difficult for non - experts in qkd security to make sense of the literature ; moreover , even experts are often not aware of certain basics in some of the relevant fields .",
    "many who perform assessments on qkd security follow the vague community consensus on qkd security being guaranteed by rigorous proofs .",
    "a common perception is that qkd gives  perfect secrecy , \" as asserted for example in a useful recent monograph on conventional cryptography [ 3 , p. 589 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that qkd is commonly taught to physics students as being an important application of quantum optics because qkd is provably secure . to our knowledge",
    ", the provable security property is often taught as being self evident and is not questioned on any level ( recent advances in quantum hacking may be an exception ; however , such attacks are based on discrepancies between the model and real systems as opposed to the security of the model itself ) .",
    "the commonly cited reason for no - cloning or quantum entanglement is very far from sufficient . even in the technical literature",
    ", a qkd - generated key is often regarded as perfect whenever it is used in an application .",
    "one main purpose of this paper is to correct such a misconception and to demonstrate how the imperfect generated key affects the security proofs themselves .",
    "security proofs by their nature are conceptual , logical and mathematical yet indispensable for guaranteeing security .",
    "cryptographic security can not be guaranteed by experiment , if only because possible attack scenarios can not be exhausted via experiment .",
    "however , security is a most serious issue in cryptography and must be thoroughly and carefully analyzed [ 4 , two prefaces and ch . 1 ; see also quotes in appendix i ] .",
    "_ the burden of proof _ is on one who makes the security claim , not on others to produce specific successful general attacks .    in this paper",
    ", we will describe the actual security theory situation of qkd with just enough technical materials for accurate statements on the results .",
    "we will be able to describe some main security issues without going into the physics , and we can treat everything at a _ classical _ probability level , to which a _ quantum _ description invariably reduces .",
    "we will discuss in what ways these security issues have been handled inadequately . some major work in the qkd security literature will be mentioned and also discussed in appendix i , which may help clarify the issues and illuminate the development that led to the current security situation . in appendix ii , we compare qkd to conventional cryptography and provide a preliminary assessment on the usefulness of qkd when conventional cryptography appears adequate .",
    "( note that cryptography is a small and relatively minor subarea of computer security [ 4 ] .",
    "it is the latter that results in news headlines . ) in appendix iii , some possible objections to certain points of this paper from the viewpoint of the current qkd literature are answered .",
    "table 1 in section viii.b gives a summary comparison of various numerical values .",
    "generally , perfect security can not be obtained in any key distribution scheme with security dependent on physical characteristics due to system imperfections mixed with the attacker s disturbance , which must be considered in the security model .",
    "this is especially the case with qkd , which involves small signal levels .",
    "we use the term  qkd \" in this paper to _ refer _ to protocols with security depending on information - disturbance tradeoffs [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , excluding those based on other principles such as the  kcq \" approach in [ 5 ] , which permits stronger signals and for which no general security proof has yet been claimed . in qkd , one can at best generate a key that is close to perfect in some sense. this immediately raises the issue of a security criterion , its operational significance and its quantitative level .",
    "security is very much a quantitative issue .",
    "quantitative security is quite hard to properly define and to rigorously evaluate ; thus , there are few such results in the literature on conventional mathematics - based cryptography .",
    "it is at least as hard in physics - based cryptography , and there is yet no true valid quantification of qkd security under all possible attacks .    that there are problems and gaps in qkd security proofs has been discussed since 2003 in [ 6 , app . a ] , [ 7 ] , [ 5 , app .",
    "a and b ] , [ 8 ] , culminating in the numerical adequacy issue in [ 9 ] in 2012 , which provides the trace distance criterion level for a so - called  near - perfect \" key .",
    "this last numerical adequacy point is emphasized in [ 10 ] , and a reply is given in [ 11 ] , which in turn is replied to in [ 12 ] ; no further exchange on this topic has resulted . the basic point of [ 11 ] is that a trace distance level of @xmath0 is sufficient for security .",
    "there have since been several arxiv papers that elaborate upon the several qkd security issues that have yet to be resolved .",
    "this paper summarizes and supersedes those papers in a coherent framework for analyzing qkd security .",
    "this paper shows in what ways , even at a value of @xmath0 , which is ten orders of magnitude beyond what is currently achievable , such a trace distance level does not provide adequate security guarantees in a cryptosystem that involves the use of a vast number of keys at such a level ; see section viii .    before proceeding to a detailed treatment , we list the major problems of currently available qkd security proofs as follows :    1 .   the chosen security criterion ,",
    "namely , a quantum trace distance @xmath1 , has been misinterpreted .",
    "the operational security guarantee that it yields does not cover some important security concerns .",
    "the numerical security level that has been obtained is far from adequate .",
    "the very strong level of guarantee asserted recently is derived from erroneous reasoning .",
    "3 .   the known security proofs are not complete nor justified at various stages in a valid manner , especially in connection with the major necessary step of error correction , which has not been treated in a rigorous manner .",
    "a trace distance level guarantee of a key @xmath2 limits the information - theoretic security level that can be obtained when @xmath2 is used for message authentication , taking away an otherwise available security parameter that allows arbitrarily high levels of message authentication security .",
    "there are many other serious issues facing qkd security proofs , many of which relating to physics and implementation .",
    "these issues will not be discussed in this paper , which concentrates on a careful exposition of the above four points .",
    "much of the technical content in this paper is conceptual analysis , especially on the use of probability in real - world applications .",
    "the applications are not essentially mathematical or physical in nature , which is partly why they are easy to miss and result in various confusions .",
    "sections iii.a , iv , v.c , viii.b , and appendix iii contain relevant clarifications on the subtle meaning of probability in real - world applications .",
    "note that knowledge of physics , classical or quantum , is _ not _ required to understand the content of this paper .",
    "furthermore , the relevant basic cryptography concepts will be explained when being introduced .",
    "we briefly review the different representations of conventional and quantum cryptography in regard to the cryptographic goals of privacy and key distribution [ 3 ] .",

    "1 , the conventional stream cipher encryption of a data sequence @xmath3 for privacy is depicted .",
    "a user alice transmits @xmath4 , which is the xor of the data bits @xmath5 and running key bits @xmath6 for each @xmath7 :    @xmath8    we use uppercase to denote random variables and lower case to denote the values they take on .",
    "thus , from ( 1 ) , alice transmits @xmath9 for given @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "a prior shared key bit sequence @xmath10 unknown to the attacker eve is known to alice and the other user bob , who can decrypt @xmath11 from @xmath12 by knowing @xmath6 .",
    "the attacker eve would then learn nothing about @xmath13 from @xmath14 without knowing something about @xmath2 .",
    "she knows nothing about @xmath2 when the @xmath15 are ( statistically ) independent bits with equal probability of being 0 or 1 .",
    "this so - called one - time pad \" encryption , her probability of obtaining the sequence @xmath13 correctly given that she knows @xmath14 through interception is equal to her _ a priori _ probability on @xmath13 .",
    "for uniformly distributed @xmath13 ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the bit length of the sequences .",
    "( the vertical bar @xmath18 is always used in this paper to denote the bit length of the sequence within it . lower case @xmath19 are discrete probability distributions , and no continuous distributions will be used . )",
    "we may represent this by @xmath20 , namely , the uniform random variable to eve .",
    "thus , in addition to @xmath21 , which is the _ a priori _ probability of each @xmath22 , there is also no correlation of any type between the @xmath22s that eve can find .",
    "this is  perfect secrecy . \"",
    "the security under discussion is the _ information - theoretic security _ of the intrinsic uncertainty to eve .",
    "( see section iii and appendix ii . )",
    "the correlation among bits in @xmath2 is a most important feature often missed in cryptography , especially in connection with the trace distance ( statistical distance ) criterion , which is presented in section iv.a and also in section iv.b in the context of distinguishability .",
    "the goal of qkd is to generate a key @xmath2 , which ideally is @xmath23 , by transmitting bits @xmath24 from alice to bob via quantum signals with no use of shared secret keys . in reality",
    ", a prior shared secret key is needed to start executing the qkd protocol , at least for message authentication against man - in - the - middle attacks .",
    ".,width=288 ]    the qkd key generation process is depicted in fig .",
    "2 . for definiteness ,",
    "the original bb84 protocol [ 1 ] is schematically described in the following , which contains the key idea of qkd .",
    "a sequence of quantum optical signals is modulated by the data @xmath24 and sent from alice to bob , with each bit @xmath25 modulating a separate quantum signal .",
    "( we use @xmath24 to distinguish these key generation data from the data @xmath13 on which the qkd key @xmath2 is used to encrypt , as in fig . 1 . ) in bb84 , each quantum signal is a single photon in a so - called ",
    "qubit\" , a two - dimensional quantum state space",
    ". eve could intercept and set her probe on the qubits during signal transmission .",
    "bob measures on one of the two bb84 bases randomly upon receiving each qubit signal and obtains a bit value of 0 or 1 .",
    "after the entire sequence is measured , bob publicly announces which basis he measured on each @xmath7 , and the ones  mismatched \" to alice s transmitted signal are discarded .",
    "then , a portion of the remaining matched ones is used to check the frequency of bit error , which is called the _ quantum bit error rate _ ( qber ) .",
    "the other portion is called the _ sifted key _ @xmath26",
    "from which the final key @xmath2 is to be generated .    for our purposes",
    ", there is __no need _ _ to understand the exact physics and underlying rationale of the above procedure. the only thing that matters for the purposes of this paper is the representation of eve s knowledge on the generated @xmath2 via her final classical observed value @xmath14 by the joint distribution @xmath27 .",
    "eve s probe inevitably disturbs the quantum signals if she learns anything from the probe , a characteristic quantum effect of the information - disturbance tradeoff , which has no classical analog .",
    "it is usually assumed that the users would regard all disturbance as indicated by the qber level to be from eve s interception .",
    "they would estimate how much  information \" eve can learn about @xmath24 with such a disturbance. ( the vague word ",
    "information \" would be specified precisely in context . )",
    "the users have to correct the errors in @xmath26 to obtain a useful key @xmath2 .",
    "such errors would always be present from system imperfections due to the low signal level .",
    "error correction is typically accomplished by an ordinary error correcting code ( ecc ) on @xmath26 , as indicated in fig .",
    "2 . the users then transfer the estimate of eve s information on @xmath26 to the error - free @xmath28 .",
    "if eve s information is below a certain threshold level , the users may employ privacy amplification\" [ 1 ] on @xmath28 to eliminate it .",
    "the privacy amplification code ( pac ) usually involves linear hashing compression [ 3 ] on @xmath28 to a final generated key @xmath2 with bit length @xmath29 , which is a small fraction of @xmath30 .    what is the security desired and claimed for the qkd - generated key @xmath2 ?",
    "because this is a physical and in particular a quantum cryptosystem , there are many mutually exclusive different observed values @xmath14 that eve could obtain from her choice of quantum probe and based on the quantum measurement on the probe .",
    "she could estimate various properties of @xmath2 from the @xmath14 that she obtains , each with a certain probability of success .",
    "she also would gather side information relevant to improving her estimates before she measures her probe and makes estimates .",
    "such side information would include the bb84 bases open announcement and the specific pac employed in the qkd round .",
    "it may also involve the specific ecc used .",
    "the users goal is to make eve s probability of success in obtaining any characteristic of @xmath2 close to the level whereby @xmath2 is perfect , i.e. , when @xmath23 .",
    "an especially significant attack on privacy encryption is the _ known - plaintext attack _ ( kpa ) , which is the main vulnerability of conventional mathematics - based encryption . the _ ciphertext - only attack _ , for which @xmath31 to eve , that qkd security analyses focus upon is usually not considered as a serious risk for symmetric - key ciphers [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , which can be further substantiated in an information - theoretic manner .",
    "a brief summary is given in appendix ii , which compares qkd with conventional cryptography .",
    "a kpa runs as follows .",
    "eve may know a portion of the data @xmath13 that is encrypted with @xmath2 and hence knows part of @xmath2 because @xmath14 is open .",
    "she may then learn something about the remainder of @xmath2 through correlations among the bits in an imperfect @xmath2 and hence something about the unknown portion of @xmath13 .",
    "it is such a kpa when a qkd key is being used that must be protected against .",
    "this implies that correlations between bits in @xmath2 must be addressed in qkd security .",
    "perfect secrecy _ against all attack possibilities would require that @xmath2 is uniformly distributed to eve for any @xmath14 that she may possibly obtain that is allowed by the laws of quantum physics together with all her side information .",
    "thus far , a security criterion is chosen to measure the difference between an imperfect key and a perfect key with a quantitative security level .",
    "the term __unconditional security _ _ was coined [ 13 ] and widely used to include the following two conditions : + _ unconditional security : _    1 .",
    "complete generality on possible attacks ; 2 .",
    "quantitative security level can be made as close to perfect as desired .",
    "the data bit length @xmath32 or @xmath29 in a qkd round is often taken to be a",
    "_ security parameter _",
    "@xmath33 , namely , the quantitative security level improves with increasing @xmath33 and becomes perfect as @xmath34 [ 13 ] .",
    "    such unconditional security for qkd is often claimed because it distinguishes qkd from conventional cryptography ; moreover , it is the only advantage of qkd ( see appendix ii ) .",
    "security against only some attacks means that the qkd approach may not lead to good security in the future when other attacks become practical .",
    "the latter is often taken to be the situation with conventional cryptography .",
    "unconditional security in qkd remains asserted on occasion , both theoretically for a given protocol and physical models and experimentally as potential or even actualized possibility .",
    "however , _ no _ security parameter has ever been found for any qkd protocol at any key generation rate , and certainly , @xmath32 and @xmath29 are not such parameters , as will be shown in section iii.b .",
    "to explain the process and requirements of a security proof , we proceed to quantitatively describe the information - theoretic security of a cryptosystem.",
    "it is sometimes asserted that a cryptographic security criterion is a matter of  definition \" and  interpretation , \" although this is highly misleading and can be considered incorrect .",
    "there are definite specific characteristics in a cryptographic goal on which users want to protect against successful attacks",
    ". a security criterion would be inadequate for a security task it is supposed to serve if it does not lead to a guarantee at an adequate quantitative level .",
    "the range of adequate levels may depend on the specific application ; however , one can not sensibly  define \" a protocol to be secure if its security criterion and level do not cover such possible attacks .",
    " interpretation \" of a mathematical statement , on security or any other matter , may be correct or incorrect when it is applied to a real - world situation .",
    "moreover , there have been many erroneous interpretations in qkd security analysis .",
    "these errors are mainly conceptual errors , not mathematical nor mainly mathematical mistakes .",
    "these errors often involve reading ordinary meanings into a word that in context is a technical term that carries only a precise technical meaning .",
    "we will see many examples of these errors in sections iii to viii of this paper .",
    "the operationally or empirically meaningful security criteria on the secrecy of any shared key string @xmath2 for privacy or key distribution , whether it is generated by qkd or any method , are the attacker eve s probabilities or rates of success in correctly obtaining various parts or characteristics of @xmath2 , including @xmath2 itself in its entirety .",
    "this is the case even in complexity - based security , as we will see . ",
    "the quantitative information - theoretic security of a key @xmath2 is often described by a single - number security criterion , such as eve s shannon mutual information @xmath35 on @xmath2 [ 14 ] through her observation @xmath14 , which she may obtain by intercepting the signal transmission .",
    "this @xmath35 is defined [ 14 ] from the joint distribution @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the distribution of the generated @xmath2 obtained by the users under a given quantum probe from eve .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath38 is specified through the cryptosystem representation and eve s measurement result , from which she derives her estimate of a characteristic @xmath39 , denoted by @xmath40 , which is a function of @xmath41 . for example , from @xmath41 , she could estimate @xmath42 as @xmath43 . because she takes @xmath44 to be @xmath2 , we can simplify our notation by simply writing @xmath2 itself instead of @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath2 is being observed from eve s viewpoint .",
    "thus , @xmath38 gives the conditional probability that the @xmath41 observed by eve given @xmath45 is the actual key generated .",
    "eve can now derive @xmath46 for all possible @xmath45 through @xmath38 and bayes rule .",
    "the criterion @xmath35 gives the number of shannon bits @xmath35 concerning @xmath2 known to eve because , in this case , one can write    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the conditional entropy of @xmath2 given @xmath14 [ 14 ] . note that , as we just indicated , eve has a _ full distribution _ on her knowledge of @xmath2 given any observation @xmath41 with the conditional distribution @xmath46 .",
    "we may assume that all the side information that eve may possess has been considered in her final @xmath46 .",
    "we order the @xmath49 possible values of @xmath2 entering @xmath46 and suppress its @xmath41 dependence so that , in various abbreviated notations , eve has @xmath50 with    @xmath51    this probability profile is the complete  information \" eve has on @xmath2 given her observation @xmath41 .",
    "any single number criterion , such as @xmath35 , _ merely _ expresses a constraint on @xmath52 . when @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 , and eve knows nothing about @xmath13 . for a given level @xmath55 ,",
    "what does this imply for the security of @xmath2?    this question arises for any criterion that is used as a theoretic quantity . a single - number information - theoretic measure on the uncertainty or ",
    "information \" is a theoretical quantity whose operational or empirical meaning needs to be independently explained [ 15 , preface ] . in the context of ordinary communications , the two theoretic quantities entropy and mutual information are related to the empirical data rate and error rate through the shannon source and channel coding theorems",
    ". what would be the operational meaning of these quantities in the context of cryptography ?",
    "one __cannot _ _ simply assume the word  information \" for a technical concept would carry its ordinary meaning in any application , especially not quantitatively .",
    "shannon himself emphasized such a danger early on [ 16 ] . in shannon s cryptography paper [ 17 ] ,",
    "he used such information measures ; however , except for the ideal case of @xmath56 for a one - time pad , he did not explain their operational cryptographic significance .    in cryptography , one",
    "is concerned that eve should not be able to correctly estimate various quantities associated with a key @xmath2 from her observation and side information .",
    "such success is generally obtained only probabilistically. therefore , this operational security requirement translates to eve _ not _ being able to estimate such quantities well , i.e. , not with appreciable probability . in the case of perfect secrecy ,",
    "eve s @xmath52 above equals the uniform @xmath57 . therefore ,",
    "in the general imperfect case , her estimate probabilities as derived from @xmath52 should be close to that derived from @xmath57 . in particular , the exact level needs to be quantitatively compared to that from @xmath57 and its numerical adequacy to ensure security for a given application .",
    "thus , given a security criterion level that sets a constraint on @xmath52 above , we would need to ascertain what success probabilities eve may possibly obtain .",
    "specifically , we would compare the @xmath58 from any @xmath46 not ruled out by the security criterion constraint to the @xmath23 level : @xmath59 we use the notation @xmath60 to explicitly demonstrate that the @xmath58 level refers to the @xmath2 with a distribution @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , @xmath60 , eve s maximum probability of correctly obtaining @xmath2 , needs to be sufficiently small for any meaningful claim to security even if it may be far larger than the @xmath61 level. we would address such a general security probability guarantee based on security measures in sections iv and v. their connections to the numerical security levels of concrete protocols are discussed in section viii .",
    "when @xmath2 is used to encrypt data @xmath13 , part of @xmath62 may be known to eve in a kpa , as discussed in section ii .",
    "let @xmath63 be the subsequence of @xmath2 known to eve , say , when @xmath2 is used as a one - time pad , and let @xmath64 be a subsequence of @xmath65 , @xmath65 being the remainder of @xmath2 excluding @xmath63 . then , eve s optimal success probabilities from such an attack should be compared to the perfect security level when @xmath23 ,    @xmath66    where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the sequences obtained from @xmath57 with the same bit positions as @xmath63 , @xmath65 , and @xmath64 , respectively . in general , eve may possess only statistical information on @xmath13 without knowing part of it exactly .",
    "we will not address this more complicated situation in this paper .",
    "it is important to note that we may write    1 .",
    "operational guarantee for an event = + rule out its possible occurrence with a high probability    an average number of occurrences ( sample mean ) is _ not _ an operational guarantee because the number of occurrence is itself a random quantity from a finite number of trials , each of which has the same probability distribution .",
    "this does not mean that an average can not be used as a measure of security .",
    "it means that an average is a less accurate measure compared to a probability statement on individual occurrences or on a multiple - use sample mean .",
    "if the variance is known in addition to the average ( mean ) , the probability statement on the sample mean can be made , and operational guarantees can be restored .",
    "if only the average is known , the markov inequality can be used to provide an accurate individual probability statement , as shown in section v.c .",
    "complexity - based security is operationally equivalent to the following success probability characterization .",
    "let @xmath70 be the total number of possibilities that eve can attempt computationally among the @xmath71 possible @xmath2 values to determine if a particular value is the correct value , as in opening a safe .",
    "it is easy to show that , with a uniform chance of success for each trial , her overall probability of success is , for a uniform probability distribution on the @xmath72 possible cases ,    @xmath73    eq .",
    "( 7 ) can be readily generalized when eve s success probability for each trial is not uniform but known [ 5 ] .",
    "indeed , it can be observed that there is no difference between complexity - based security and information - theoretic ( probabilistic ) security if eve is given a sufficient number of attempts to determine the correctness of a given @xmath45 , as in the case of cracking a safe .",
    "she would need at most @xmath72 trials and on average @xmath74 trials .",
    "the problem of complexity - based security is that it is very hard to prove a lower bound on the number of trials eve needs for a given problem , and no such proof exists for any common problem .",
    "it will be observed that it is also very hard to prove qkd security , and no such proof yet exists as well.      in the literature on classical noise - based key generation within information - theoretic security [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20], both before and after the emergence of qkd in 1984 [ 21 ] , the security criterion used is the mutual information @xmath75 between the generated key @xmath2 and eve s observation @xmath14 .",
    "no relation of this information - theoretic quantity to eve s operational success probability was given until [ 5]. the issue will be discussed further in the next section in connection with the statistical distance criterion .",
    "here , we would like to remove a major misconception about security proofs that use the mutual information criterion , first discussed in appendix a of ref [ 5 ] and which directly carries over to the qkd case for the @xmath1 criterion as well [ 5 ] , [ 22 ] .",
    "apart from the problem of bounding @xmath60 from @xmath35 , the latter we will abbreviate as @xmath76 , the asymptotic security proofs that show , with @xmath77 ,    @xmath78    were erroneously supposed as proofs that @xmath2 is asymptotically perfect .",
    "that is confusing the meaning of a limit because @xmath79 is not a number .",
    "what occurs here is that the convergence rate of @xmath76 to @xmath80 determines the asymptotic security level as follows . from lemma 2 in [ 5 ] , for any @xmath81 , it is possible that    @xmath82    eq .",
    "( 9 ) states that , under the constraint of a given level of @xmath35 , there are possible @xmath37 with @xmath58 at the same quantitative level as @xmath83 .",
    "thus , a very insecure @xmath2 , compared to @xmath57 , can satisfy ( 8) , even when @xmath76 converges exponentially in @xmath84 :    @xmath85    for a constant @xmath86 .",
    "it is possible given eq .",
    "( 10 ) that @xmath87 , as compared to @xmath61 for a uniform key .",
    "apart from condition ( i ) of unconditional security in section ii , such an asymptotic proof of ( 8) does not imply condition ( ii ) for unconditional security . indeed , it does not even imply @xmath2 is in any sense near perfect , as the above case ( 10 ) shows .",
    "we may mention that the current quantum criterion @xmath1 suffers from the same exponential problem as will be discussed in the following section . although @xmath1 can be directly used in a finite @xmath84 protocol, this exponential problem is why relatively large and insecure levels of @xmath1 are obtained in a real protocol with sizable key rates .",
    "the quantum generalization of @xmath76 is called  accessible information \" , which is the maximum mutual information @xmath35 that eve can obtain from any quantum measurement on her probe. such an additional issue of measurement optimization is characteristic of quantum detection [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .",
    "this issue plays no role in our context after we take @xmath76 to be eve s accessible information so that the quantum security situation reduces to a classical one under such @xmath76 .",
    "the early proofs of qkd security up until 2004 are based on the use of such an accessible information criterion as well as the current proof on the so - called measurement - device - independent approach [ 25 ] .",
    "thus , the proofs all suffer directly from the problems explained above and remain in error even after the proof is converted to one with the trace distance criterion . a particularly influential early security proof is given in [ 26 ] , which is the basis of the heuristic generalizations used to include various system imperfections in [ 27 ] .",
    "the side information that eve has from the open announcement of ecc and pac of fig .",
    "2 are considered in the proofs of [ 13 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . in section vii",
    ", we will discuss how they considered in more recent proofs and what problems are yet to be resolved.",

    "a security proof has to address all such possible @xmath37 under a specific class of attacks or all possible attacks allowed by the law of physics , as in condition ( i ) of unconditional security .",
    "it has been explicitly shown in section iii that an information - theoretic single - number security criterion merely puts a constraint on what possible @xmath37 eve may obtain , and it must satisfy the criterion constraint . for mutual information , the constraint states that @xmath94 must not give a higher @xmath76 value that is ruled out by the security proof . under the @xmath76 criterion , @xmath60 given by eqs .",

    "apparently , kpa security on @xmath196 of ( 6 ) can be obtained directly from ( 13 ) by writing its left - hand side as an average , with @xmath197 being the remainder of @xmath65 apart from @xmath64 : @xmath198 for @xmath199 it is observed from ( 23 ) that the probability guarantee for kpa now is an average over @xmath63 .",
    "this is fully in accord with the above counter - example . when we remove the @xmath63 average to obtain an individual guarantee , we need to apply a markov inequality for @xmath63 .",
    "the drawing of a specific @xmath1 from possible pacs and a specific @xmath41 from an observation @xmath14 also requires a markov inequality .",
    "this will be discussed in section v.c. in section v.d , we will make clear that all these classical results are what quantum results reduce to .",
    "      the following security question arises : how many bits will eve correctly obtain even though her estimate of @xmath2 or @xmath64 is incorrect as a sequence under a @xmath1 guarantee through ( 13 ) or ( 23 ) ?",
    "for example , eve guessing a 4-bit @xmath2 to be @xmath200 when it is actually @xmath201 makes a sequence estimate error but only a one - bit error out of four , not the uniformly random result of two errors .",
    "however , an error rate leak in security that differs from the uniformly random level of @xmath202 is equivalent to a non - uniform _ a priori _",
    "distribution @xmath203 , which is known to eve .",
    "for instance , eve knowing that six out of ten bits of a @xmath102 are correct but not knowing which are the correct bits is equivalent to having an _ a priori _ @xmath204 with a biased probability @xmath205 on each single bit in the case that the bits are independent .",
    "hence , the issue must be addressed in assessing ultimate security .    in ordinary communications , this is called the _ bit error rate _ ( ber ) issue in coded systems , in contrast to the sequence error rate addressed in most performance analyses .",
    "this does not represent a serious issue there because , typically , a sequence error rate itself can already be driven to zero and because ber is in any case an improvement over the sequence error rate .",
    "the main information - theoretic problem to cryptography users concerns eve s performance from the users viewpoint , which is _ opposite _ to the performance concern of the users themselves .",
    "it turns out that the relative importance of the different issues may be different in cryptography in addition to the fact that the required performance analysis is often more difficult , say , in lower bounding instead of upper bounding eve s error probability .",
    "the ber is @xmath172 when @xmath23 under any attack. from the failure probability interpretation of @xmath1 , one would obtain , for any subset @xmath102 of @xmath2 in the absence of known - plaintext attacks , the following bound on such a bit error rate .",
    "@xmath206    counter - examples to ( 25 ) can be readily constructed for small @xmath84. the actual ber needs to be validly bounded from a given @xmath103 .",
    "eve s ber , which is less than @xmath202 , gives her information that is not available for a perfect @xmath23 , and its quantitative security consequence needs to be obtained .",
    "it is important to observe that the ber is a very important security criterion in addition to those of ( 6 ) ; however , it alone is not sufficient as a security guarantee .",
    "all these different probability criteria arise naturally for different security concerns for a given @xmath37 , and all have direct operational meaning .",
    "they are perfectly protected against eve when @xmath20 .",
    "an approximate bound for the whole @xmath2 can be derived [ 41 ] from standard information theory results through the entropy @xmath207 of @xmath2 .",
    "let the bit error probability be @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the probability that the @xmath7th bit in @xmath2 is incorrectly obtained from her regardless of the estimate of @xmath2 . with @xmath210 being the binary entropy function , we have from the fano inequality [ 8] that @xmath211 the right - hand side of ( 27 ) can be bounded via @xmath103 for @xmath107 by neglecting @xmath76 compared to @xmath207 and using the theorem in [ 14 , p.664], @xmath212 a bound on @xmath213 follows from combining eqs .",

    "the criterion employed is usually the probability an item fails to meet a pre - set standard , not the average number of failures .",
    "the former is a more stringent and operationally meaningful criterion , as we will see .",

    "this is the situation in the qkd security proofs .",
    "there are at least three reasons why probability guarantees should be used instead of average guarantees .",
    "first of all , consider the ( artificial ) example of a cryptosystem that has a 50/50 chance of being secure for 100 years or totally insecure .",
    "its average security duration is 50 years ; however , no one would find such security meaningful .",
    "second , the average has no direct operational meaning when the trial sample size is small relative to the size of the probability ( sample ) space for a single trial .",
    "this is evident in the case of one sample trial , the meaning of probability for which has been extensively discussed ; see , for example , [ 42 ] .",
    "there are insufficient samples for the average effect to kick in with a small variance in the sample mean ( average ) , and we should use probability to assess the trial sample property .",
    "this is found to always be the case in qkd protocols .",
    "a third reason is that an empirical average ( sample mean ) is not a deterministic quantity .",
    "an empirical average lacks operational significance without some guarantee that the spread around the mean is sufficiently small .    in qkd protocols",
    ", there are many random parameters with a probability distribution .",
    "the final trace distance @xmath1 obtained is itself an average over the possible pac codes , only one of which is used in a single round ( see section vi.a ) .",
    "such an average result is common in information theory work with the so - called  random coding \" argument .",
    "the possible number of pac codes is substantially larger than @xmath219 even if a toeplitz matrix is used as the pac , as is commonly the case .",
    "therefore , the averaged @xmath1 has to be first converted into an individual @xmath1 from ( 29 ) . then",
    ", a measurement of some @xmath14 is involved in eve s attack , which is the suppressed @xmath41 dependence of eve s @xmath37 that we focused on previously .",
    "either classically or quantum mechanically , the guarantee is on the average over @xmath14 , and it also needs to be converted into a probability for a specific @xmath41. the number of possible @xmath41s again far exceeds @xmath219 .",
    "these two averages are both on @xmath1 and can be combined .",
    "there is another average over the known @xmath63 in kpa that we need to address in the case of protection against known - plaintext attacks discussed in section v.a .",
    "therefore , in total , we would need to apply ( 29 ) one or two times .",
    "the inequality ( 29 ) allows one to exchange the level of the failure threshold @xmath220 with another  failure probability \" level @xmath221 $ ] that exceeds the desired threshold level . in qkd security proofs ,",
    "the @xmath215 itself is a probability , as observed in sections iv and v , and is a random quantity depending on the values of several other random system parameters .",
    "if we did not use these two probabilities , we would not know quantitatively what individual probability guarantee we may obtain .",
    "we could address such uses of ( 29 ) in the final security guarantee by adjusting the exchange to minimize any  failure probability \" of the protocol as follows .",
    "consider the @xmath222 of ( 13 ) when @xmath158 is negligible compared to @xmath103 .",
    "then , with @xmath223 denoting the conditional probability of @xmath222 given @xmath224 , etc . , we have , under @xmath225 = \\epsilon$ ] and @xmath226 ,    @xmath227    we have used ( 29 ) and minimization over @xmath228 to arrive at the guarantee ( 30 ) .",

    "because the ber is a very nonlinear function of the security criterion @xmath103 , it is not known how the average @xmath103 can be converted into an individual guarantee , in contrast to the @xmath222 or @xmath235 case above . of course",
    ", we do not even have a ber bound without such an average , except for the whole @xmath2 from ( 27)-(28 ) .",
    "the numerical security guarantee from ( 30 ) and ( 33 ) is devastatingly worse than the original @xmath89-level guarantee . indeed , even with the incorrect failure probability interpretation of @xmath1 discussed in section iv.a , one application of ( 29 ) is required to obtain an individual guarantee on eve s probability of successfully estimating the whole @xmath2 even without any side information on @xmath63 during its use , as discussed above ; see section viii for numerical examples .      at this point",
    ", it is appropriate to emphasize that the classical analysis of @xmath103 and @xmath76 that we presented in this paper applies directly to the quantum case .",
    "this is because , regardless of the utilized quantum criterion , @xmath1 or otherwise , the criterion would reduce to a classical quantity once eve makes her quantum measurement on her quantum probe .",
    "the trace distance @xmath1 would reduce to a classical statistical distance @xmath103 , and the accessible information would reduce to classical mutual information . however , different quantum quantities may lead to the same classical quantity but are essentially different quantum mechanically .",
    "this turns out to be the case for quantum accessible information and the holevo quantity ; a guarantee from the former allows quantum information locking leaks , which is not the case for the latter [ 43 ] .",
    "the holevo quantity guarantee is essentially equivalent to the trace distance @xmath1 guarantee . from this quantum equivalence",
    "[ 28 ] , [ 43 ] , one immediately has the following bounds , which establish the essential equivalence of @xmath103 and @xmath76 in a classical protocol and which provide a general security guarantee to classical protocol security proofs via @xmath76 similar to that provided by @xmath103 given in this paper : @xmath236 the @xmath103 in ( 31 ) is an average over the observation @xmath14 in classical protocols , which is automatically included in the quantum trace distance .",
    "this is exactly as in the @xmath35 case.",
    "in this section , we consider the problem of quantifying the security of the ecc output @xmath28 and the pac output @xmath2 , the generated key in fig .",
    "2 , as well as how ecc and pac affect the final key generation rate .",
    "the information leaks from error correction and privacy amplification were not considered in the earlier security proofs [ 7 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .",
    "this is sometimes justified by the invalid reason that the open exchange in these two steps is performed after eve sets her quantum probe .",
    "however , eve may make her quantum measurement and key estimate after the open exchange .",
    "apparently , the pac step can be rigorously quantified if the ecc step has also been quantified ; however , the ecc step can not be quantified , and there is no hint as to how a rigorous quantification of error correction may be performed in a qkd protocol . before discussing the error correction problem ,",
    "we first discuss privacy amplification and its effect on the key rate .",
    "the basic idea of privacy amplification is to increase the security level by compressing the input bit sequence into a shorter output bit sequence . intuitively , this is well known to be possible when the input bits are statistically independent to eve .",
    "for example , given two bits @xmath237 and @xmath238 , each known to eve with error probability @xmath239 , the bit @xmath240 is known to her with error probability @xmath241 , which is larger than @xmath242 . when the input bits are correlated , if simply from eve s possible attack , the situation is far less simple .",
    "useful results can be obtained using linear hashing compression represented by a @xmath243 matrix via the so - called leftover hash lemma [ 44 ] , which has a direct quantum generalization [ 45 ] .",
    "the leftover hash lemma for  universal hashing , \" which covers all pac in use , provides the tradeoff between the @xmath1-level @xmath113 of @xmath2 and its length @xmath29 by the following formula , with @xmath244 , @xmath245 because it is not known whether @xmath29 greater than the minimum @xmath246 on the right - hand side of ( 2 ) could be obtained , the guaranteed key rate is given by the quantity @xmath246 .",
    "note that @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "furthermore , the minimum @xmath113 one can obtain is , from @xmath249 , @xmath250 we can simply take the quantum @xmath113 in this paper to be the largest statistical distance @xmath97 that eve may obtain .",
    "this leftover hash lemma guarantee is an average over the family of possible hash functions from which the pac is drawn .",
    "the specific pac used is openly announced , and the performance is an average over possible codes , which is common in  random coding \"- type arguments .",
    "a specific @xmath112 or @xmath113 level has to be first guaranteed in the security analysis to remove the pac averaging .",
    "there are evidently some pacs with poor security , say , whenever the pac matrix is degenerate ( rank less than @xmath29 ) , for which a degeneracy of @xmath251 would leak @xmath188 shannon bits with certainty . if such degeneracy is first tested , a daunting practical task given that @xmath29 is tens of thousands and given that @xmath30 is a multiple of @xmath29 , the resulting family is not known to obey the",
    " universal family \" condition required for the proof of the leftover hash lemma . a high - probability guarantee on an adequate specific @xmath1-level is therefore essential .",
    "the following inequality evidently holds for the @xmath2 s in fig . 2 :",
    "@xmath252 the first inequality in ( 37 ) follows from eve possibly possessing more knowledge from the error correction in estimating @xmath28 .",
    "the second inequality follows from privacy amplification being an open many - to - one transformation . as will be discussed in section vi.b , the users could and indeed may have to cover the chosen ecc via shared secret bits ; therefore",
    ", one would obtain @xmath253 assuming that _ correctness _",
    "( alice and bob agree on the same @xmath2 ) is obtained with a sufficiently high probability . in such a case ,",
    "@xmath254 when the ecc is covered by an imperfect key , there is no known bound on @xmath255 , as will be observed in section vi.b .",
    "hence , there is also _ no _ guarantee on the @xmath1-level of the final @xmath2 from ( 35 ) , and the pac step justification from ( 35 ) and ( 38 ) is lost because ( 38 ) is no longer valid .",
    "the rigorous validity of the final @xmath113 level is correspondingly _ lost _ from simply this problem .",
    "note that it is not possible to cover a pac using shared secret bits because this would require a bit cost substantially greater than the number of key bits @xmath29 generated because @xmath30 is typically many times @xmath29 .",
    "the open announcement of pac is fully considered in the leftover hash lemma .",
    "there is no similar result that would yield the pac information leak automatically from another known approach [ 46 ] .",
    "privacy amplification exemplifies the exchange of key rate and privacy level inherent in qkd protocols . for pacs",
    "to which the leftover hash lemma is applicable , there is the limit ( 35 ) on how small @xmath113 can be made whereby @xmath29 remains positive . in general , from ( 35 ) , @xmath256 sets a limit , via @xmath257 , on the number of uniform key bits that can be generated , and @xmath256 is constrained by ( 3 ) in a @xmath76 guarantee and by ( 14 ) in a @xmath103 or @xmath1 guarantee on @xmath26 .",
    "such an exchange is fundamental .",
    "it has not been shown how , and it appears impossible , one obtains a key at a given rate of @xmath29 per round with @xmath2 made arbitrarily close to perfect by increasing a security parameter in either a finite or an asymptotic protocol .",
    "in particular , it is not possible to obtain @xmath60 arbitrarily close to @xmath258 from repeated use of linear pac , which is a direct consequence of ( 35)-(36 ) .",
    "it is not known whether a pac may exist that leads to a better exchange than ( 35 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "substantially more secure keys than those reported in the literature can be obtained from ( 35 ) at the expense of a decreased key rate [ 9 ] . in particular , a  near - perfect \" key @xmath2 with @xmath259 may be obtained , although that alone does not address the unsolved security issues concerning the ber and ecc .",
    "the error correction step is called  reconciliation \" in the early qkd literature and is to be achieved by an open exchange cascade protocol [ 47 ] .",
    "there is no valid quantitative result on cascade [ 48 ] because complicated nonlinearly random problems are involved .",
    "furthermore , the difficulty of bounding the resulting @xmath255 means that the subsequent pac step can not be quantified if one uses cascade .",
    "the same situation is obtained when the error correction step is performed openly , as further discussed later in this subsection .",
    "currently , ecc is universally employed for error correction in qkd protocols . in particular ,",
    "large ldpc codes are used , the performance of which is difficult to analyze [ 44 ] .",
    "the problem of ecc information leaking to eve was not mentioned in earlier security proofs [ 13 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , in [ 35 ] or in the recent review [ 2 ] ; however , the added side information of an ecc on @xmath26 would help eve in her estimate @xmath260 of @xmath28 if the ecc is openly known .",
    "in particular , if the ecc is too powerful , it may even correct all of eve s errors in @xmath26 . as discussed in section iv.a , for security quantification",
    ", one would need to bound @xmath255 , which is an impossible task even classically for any given long ecc .",
    "there is a further quantum issue [ 9 ] similar to quantum information locking concerning the accessible information criterion .",
    "thus , the _ only _ viable security approach is to cover the ecc using shared secret bits between uses and subtract its cost from @xmath29 to obtain the final generated key rate @xmath261 .",
    "indeed , the following formula is currently used :    @xmath262    with @xmath263 the factor @xmath264 is arbitrarily taken to be @xmath265 , the case @xmath266 being the asymptotic @xmath267 limit .    the justification of ( 39 )",
    "is given in [ 36 ] by citing the whole book [ 14 ] , which does not address such reconciliation issues or even eccs .",
    "we give the following argument for the case @xmath268 , which appears to be what is intended in the earlier paper [ 49 ] .",
    "consider a linear @xmath269 ecc with @xmath45 information digits and @xmath188 code digits [ 50 ] such that the number of parity check digits is @xmath270 .",
    "if one assumes that the @xmath26 from the @xmath24 transformation in fig .",
    "2 can be represented by a binary symmetric channel [ 8 ] with crossover probability given by the qber , then for @xmath45 given by the channel capacity @xmath271(qber ) , there exists a linear code that would correct the errors from the @xmath272 received bits for large @xmath272 by shannon s channel coding theorem , which is applicable to random coding over linear codes only . hence , the number of parity - check bits that are to be covered by a one - time pad , with @xmath188 of the @xmath269 code being @xmath272 , is @xmath273=|k''|\\cdot h_2{\\rm ( qber)}\\ ] ] thus , ( 36 ) for @xmath268 is obtained .",
    "we would first remark that the accounting in ( 39 ) regards the @xmath26 sequence as a codeword of an ecc , which is sometimes explicitly stated in qkd security analysis . in such a situation , covering the parity check bits is not sufficient to uphold ( 38 ) needed for the pac step .",
    "this is because the structural information on the specific ecc used , which is open because it would take an excessive number of shared secret bits to cover it , would induce correlations among the bits in @xmath28 such that it becomes impossible to estimate the increase in @xmath256 to @xmath255 .",
    "even the effective @xmath26 itself has been changed when it is taken as a code word . on the other hand , by regarding @xmath26 as the information digits of a linear ecc in a systematic form , alice may simply add further parity check digits and cover them by a one - time pad , hence preserving ( 38 ) . if the covered parity - check digits are assumed to be error free , then ( 39 ) continues to hold . in reality",
    ", the digits have to be error protected for the classical channel used for their transmission .",
    "if that channel is taken to have the same error rate give by qber , a different @xmath274 is obtained because the @xmath45 of the @xmath269 code is now @xmath26 : @xmath275\\ ] ] which is larger than @xmath276 .",
    "the resulting @xmath277 will be correspondingly smaller .",
    "the combined key rate reduction effect of the pac and only ( 39 ) is quite pronounced .",
    "in addition to the intrinsic physical inefficiency of qkd , they further severely limit the obtainable key rate in a full protocol .",
    "there are several basic problems with such an approach to quantifying ecc security [ 9 ] , [ 51 ] .",
    "the assumption of a binary symmetric channel is not valid under general attack by eve ; otherwise , there would have been no problem in quantifying the @xmath26 security since qkd day one .",
    "the pulling back of the asymptotic @xmath267 limit to a finite @xmath272 with an ad hoc factor @xmath265 is completely unjustified . although the parity - check covering bit cost in a concrete protocol may be smaller than ( 40 ) when the protocol continues to function correctly ( from other issues , such as correctness , that we do not discuss in this paper",
    "; however , see section vi.c ) , the hand waiving assignment of @xmath278 or @xmath279 in the literature shows that qkd security has _ not _ been rigorously quantified in principle .",
    "this is because no correctness is guaranteed if an empirically measured quantity is used for the bit cost in lieu of ( 39 ) .",
    "some formal results on information leakage in open eccs are presented in [ 52 ] ; however , ( 39 ) is employed in actual evaluations [ 53 ] .",
    "substantially more serious is the following basic security issue .",
    "the importance of qkd derives from the fact that key bits can be continuously generated between two users ; in particular , such bits can be used to execute a future qkd protocol .",
    "otherwise , one does not obtain effective key generation .",
    "we can perform the analysis above for ecc security only by assuming that the shared key bit used to cover the parity - check digits are the perfect one - time pad bits .",
    "when @xmath2 is not perfect , what would the information leak be ?",
    "this problem is _ never _ explicitly addressed in the literature . in the following",
    ", we will ascertain whether  universal composition \" may be of assistance .",
    "universal composition has been based on two different arguments .",
    "the standard one [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] is the metric property of @xmath99 or of the quantum trace distance . for application to the present ecc problem",
    ", we have @xmath280 where @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 refer to eve s distribution on @xmath2 for the ideal case @xmath23 , the case when a specific ecc is used and the case when no ecc is used . in the quantum situation , the classical @xmath99 would be replaced by the trace distance between corresponding density operators , i.e. , the quantum counterpart of classical distributions . from ( 43 ) , we need to bound @xmath284 to obtain a @xmath103 level with eccs , which appears to be an impossible task , and no result has ever been reported for carrying through this universal composition argument .",
    "there is no valid proof if @xmath284 is taken to be the @xmath103 level of the key @xmath285 used to cover the ecc . in particular , the ber leaks of @xmath285 discussed in section",
    "v.b would alone give eve significant side information to improve her estimate of @xmath285 and hence of @xmath26 .",
    "there is a complicated nonlinearity involved in these @xmath228 levels .",
    "the other argument [ 54 ] uses an incorrect and thus invalid failure probability interpretation of @xmath103 or @xmath1 .",
    "if the argument were to be valid , then one would add the @xmath1-level of the ecc covering key to the overall @xmath1-level .",
    "as we have observed in sections iv and v , some details concerning @xmath2 are not protected by @xmath113 ; however , they are protected under the incorrect failure probability interpretation .",
    "in particular , the interactions of the different parts of a protocol indicates that one may not need an entire portion to be correctly estimated to improve an overall estimate on another portion .",
    "how a ber leak of @xmath286 would affect eve s success probabilities through the ecc appears to be a complicated function of the given ecc .",
    "there is no reason why @xmath287 would equal @xmath288 in the absence of an explicit proof .",
    "moreover , such a level can not be generally correct because when the ecc is sufficiently powerful to correct all errors , the @xmath270 parity check digits would reveal all @xmath45 bits of @xmath28 .",
    "however , the failure probability derivation of universal composition [ 54 ] needs such further proof .",
    "using extraneous interpretation is not an alternative to a valid mathematical deduction .    the severity of the @xmath1-level limit on a qkd key in applications will be described in the following sections on message authentication . in the present ecc case",
    ", it appears extremely difficult to derive reliable estimates .",
    "one may thereby conclude that the security of the ecc step in a qkd protocol has not been , and appears that it can not be , analyzed quantitatively in a valid manner . as a consequence",
    ", the pac step is not justified due to the lack of a rigorous bound on @xmath255 , as discussed in section vii.a .",
    "hence , the security of the entire qkd protocol has not been reliably , and certainly not rigorously , quantified .",
    "this defect is not one of complexity in numerical evaluation but one of fundamental validity of reasoning .      in this section",
    ", we will summarize and explain the important basic and practical limits on the exchange between @xmath29 and @xmath113 , including the possible adjustments of what @xmath29 is in a qkd round for such an exchange .",
    "indeed , what constitutes a qkd round ?",
    "let us first ignore the practical limits on processing long eccs and pacs and simply attempt to determine what is a good choice of @xmath272 .",
    "because @xmath26 has to be error corrected , we need to introduce a measure of correctness , namely , the probability that the users agree on the same @xmath28 . in a realistic protocol , there are various system imperfections that would compromise correctness ; however , the necessity of error correction alone implies that long eccs need to be used .",
    "this arises from the fact that @xmath26 being broken into small pieces for error correction is equivalent to using a shorter ecc in sequence as a longer ecc , which has never been found to be an efficient method of correcting errors .",
    "we simply have to use a sufficiently long ecc , or equivalently a sufficiently long @xmath26 , to achieve an adequate level of correctness , i.e. , of correcting all the errors in @xmath26 with a sufficiently high probability .",
    "let us simply consider a pac from using the leftover hash lemma ( 35 ) because it is the only known way of quantifying actual security levels .",
    "even more generally , from the nature of privacy amplification as bit sequence compression , we can see that a long @xmath26 prior to compression is needed to obtain a good security level using a sufficiently high compression bit ratio .",
    "in contrast to ecc , one can break up @xmath28 into shorter pieces and compress each piece .",
    "there is no correctness constraint ; the only fundamental limit is whether the @xmath60 of the smaller pieces is sufficiently small to ensure security from ( 35 ) , assuming that ( 38 ) holds . as discussed in sections vi.a - vi.b",
    ", this assumption does not hold when the ecc is covered by an imperfect key , as in the qkd case .",
    "apart from this crucial issue , ( 35 ) provides the fundamental exchange between the key rate and the security level , other than the need to use the markov inequality multiple times , as discussed in section v.a .",
    "the key point of this connection is that it is not possible to have a key that can be made arbitrarily close to perfect by a security parameter , namely , condition ( ii ) of unconditional security in section ii , from only the asymptotic vanishing of mutual information or statistical distance , as explained in sections iii.a and iv.a . with ( 35 ) , the limit on the exchange is explicit .",
    "this limit can be relaxed in one direction by sacrificing security to obtain a better key rate with the @xmath89-smooth entropy formulation commented on in [ 43 ] . however , relaxing security is not satisfactory given the current inadequate values to be discussed in section viii .",
    "furthermore , relaxing security for longer keys is what conventional cryptography is apt to do .    in practice ,",
    "the use of long eccs and pacs is limited by the complexity of the processing involved .",
    "both ecc processing and large matrix multiplication have been studied for decades , and it appears that it will be impossible in practice to address eccs on @xmath26 broken into pieces , whereby each of which is significantly longer than @xmath289 , in the foreseeable future . in the absence of a full protocol including message authentication , a qkd _ round _ may thus be defined by the stages of the protocol that check qber and generate a sifted key @xmath26 with subsequent ecc and pac applied , as in fig .",
    "2 , the length @xmath272 being limited by current technology .    a more important concept of a qkd _ block _ @xmath290 may be defined by the pac through ( 35 ) , with security level @xmath291 determined from @xmath292 for input blocks of length @xmath293 to the pac .",
    "thus , @xmath293 has a maximum value of @xmath30 for a round but may be considerably shorter . under the assumption of @xmath28 correctness",
    ", the discussion on @xmath28 being broken down into many @xmath294 is based on practical considerations . however",
    ", this impacts on security because the blocks @xmath290 within a round may be correlated , and we also need to bound @xmath292 instead of @xmath255 .",
    "message authentication , in which a data message is checked to determine whether it has been altered , is often considered as a cryptographic task more important than privacy [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .",
    "a qkd protocol necessarily involves message authentication on the open exchange between the users for basis matching , qber checking , and concerning the choice of ecc and pac after eve sets her probe . at the very least",
    ", message authentication is required to thwart a man - in - the - middle attack eve may launch by pretending to be alice to bob and bob to alice .",
    "the security of a message authentication code ( mac ) , which is a hash function for bit compression , is sometimes based purely on complexity . in qkd protocols ,",
    "mac has to have information - theoretic security ; otherwise , it would contradict the qkd claim of being information theoretically secure .",
    "a review of information theoretically secure message authentication can be found in [ 55 , ch . 4 ] and [ 56 ] .",
    "a brief summary for our purpose is given as follows .",
    "for a data message @xmath188 of a given bit length , a data tag of much shorter bit length @xmath295 is obtained by applying a  hash function \" @xmath296 to @xmath188 , say , by a compression matrix , as in a pac , which is chosen from a given family of hash functions . in a substitution attack in the open tag case , given @xmath297 and @xmath298",
    ", eve finds @xmath299 with @xmath300 .",
    "if the @xmath296 is chosen with a uniform secret key @xmath301 , eve s success probability @xmath302 is bounded by @xmath89 when the family of the hash function is an @xmath89-asu family .",
    "concerning both substitution and impersonation attacks , in the latter , eve finds @xmath303 for a given @xmath188 such that @xmath295 for the correct @xmath296 with success probability @xmath304 : @xmath305 there is a general lower bound on the achievable @xmath89 for a given tap bit length @xmath306 that may be achieved : @xmath307    when the key @xmath301 is a qkd key with @xmath308 , it can be shown that [ 57 ] @xmath309 which may go to 1 and be achieved with equality for some @xmath303 .",
    "the average of @xmath302 over possible @xmath303s , @xmath310 , is bounded by @xmath311 , as is @xmath312 [ 57 ] : @xmath313 it follows from ( 47 ) that @xmath310 and @xmath312 , not to say @xmath302 for individual @xmath303s , can not be decreased with longer @xmath306 or longer @xmath314 so long as the level of @xmath315 is given .",
    "in particular , the authentication security parameter @xmath306 , which allows security to be arbitrarily close to perfect from ( 44 ) , is _ lost _ due to the use of an imperfect @xmath301 .",
    "we do not yet know how to rigorously remove the average @xmath1 and average @xmath303 guarantee in ( 47 ) via the markov inequality to obtain an individual guarantee because the problem is nonlinear .",
    "if we apply ( 33 ) as a guess , numerically , after averaging is removed via ( 24 ) for obtaining an individual @xmath316 and an individual @xmath303 guarantee , one would need @xmath317 to achieve the same security as a 32-bit @xmath306 from ( 45 ) and ( 47 ) or @xmath318 on a 64-bit @xmath306 .",
    "these @xmath1 values are completely unrealistic , as observed in section viii .",
    "note , however , that that is simply the @xmath60 level and does not cover ber leaks that provide information on @xmath301 to eve .",
    "similar results are available for multiple uses of a hash function with tags covered by an imperfect key @xmath319 with @xmath320 , say , for @xmath188 uses of @xmath296 [ 58 ] : @xmath321 a large number of uses of @xmath296 are needed in one qkd round because many uses are needed for authenticating a long sequence of bits .",
    "thus , the security guarantee is further lowered with ( 48 ) .",
    "its quantitative effect on the final security of @xmath2 is unknown because the universal composition argument is not valid due to the problem nonlinearity alone .",
    "equally significantly , the authentication steps in a qkd protocol have not been specified within the context of the other steps , with its imperfect levels considered .",
    "as we have seen , one can not obtain a valid derivation of the final @xmath2 security level by declaring universal composition without explicitly detailing the justification of the argument in context .",
    "the execution of a qkd round requires a significant number of shared secret key bits for message authentication and error correction .",
    "it is yet unclear how quantitative security would emerge if the key used for such purposes is imperfect , as it must be for most qkd rounds .",
    "    as emphasized in section iv.a , the criterion @xmath1 applies to a key @xmath2 generated in a single qkd round .",
    "it would _ not _ be meaningful to cite a @xmath1 level without stating the length of @xmath2 to which it applies , in effect making it a @xmath29-dependent @xmath113 .",
    "eve s maximum possible probability of obtaining the entire @xmath84-bit @xmath2 is , from ( 14 ) , @xmath322      for security quantification , it is important to make the following two distinctions .",
    "first , as discussed in section vi.d , the key length @xmath29 in @xmath113 may refer to that of a qkd round or to that of a qkd block .",
    "second , within a block , we can have many different mutually disjoint segments @xmath102 of consecutive bits under attack by eve with bit gaps between them .",

    "the latter vastly underestimates the @xmath328 of ( 50 ) .",
    "in particular , it is not the case that a single bit would be leaked with probability @xmath329 , as the failure probability per bit interpretation implies .",
    "rather , a number of bits equal to the block length @xmath330 is leaked with probability @xmath291 ( apart from the @xmath331 factor ) .",

    "the division of @xmath291 by @xmath330 is fortuitous and misleading .",
    "the numerical solution is illustrated in the next subsection .",
    "we consider here the use of many keys @xmath2 generated in different protocol rounds of a qkd system to guarantee that the worst - case parameter @xmath60 from @xmath333 from each round is used , considering that there is no average on @xmath60 itself , because there is no distribution for the complete @xmath37 .",
    "( see also objection b in appendix iii . )",
    "when there is a distribution on a random system parameter , we do not employ an average as a security measure for reasons discussed in section v.c .",
    "( see also objection c in appendix iii . ) in particular , according to the operational guarantee statement ( og ) of section iii.a , a finite sample average in an experiment is a random quantity on which probability statements can be made instead of approximating it using the nonrandom average .",

    "this is in contrast to the situation wherein a distribution exists and a markov inequality ( 29 ) can be used to produce an operational probability statement from the average ( mean ) . in the present case , the collection of @xmath58 in different rounds can be given instead .",
    "the following average values cited are to be understood as having the same import as a probability strictly speaking . here",
    ", we can not disentangle the possible conceptual subtleties of probabilities in real - world applications .",

    "the theoretical numerical values of [ 29 ] for single - photon bb84 provide a tradeoff between key rate and security .",

    "the leak becomes 300 blocks per day after one use of the markov inequality from ( 30 ) . against a kpa ,",
    "the average leakage becomes one block every 10 seconds from ( 33 ) .",
    "the experimental results in [ 59 ] give a key rate of @xmath338 bps and @xmath339 for @xmath340 , which are approximately equal to the values given in [ 36 ] .",
    "this amounts to an average maximum of 6 blocks or @xmath341 bits per day leaked against ciphertext - only attacks . against a kpa ,",
    "the rate is 100 blocks or @xmath336 bits per day .",
    "note that , as shown in ( 50 ) , these leak levels could apply to many different segment leak combinations distributed across a single block .",

    "the relevance of known - plaintext attacks is discussed in appendices ii.b and ii.c .",
    "in this paper , we do not address the problems of the very low efficiency of qkd , some of which are discussed in [ 60 ] and many of which are intrinsic due to the small signal level and resulting sensitivity to disturbance .",
    "more significantly , we do not address the physics - based security issues that have not been addressed in the qkd literature but which are fundamental to a valid security claim [ 61 ] .",
    "in addition , especially important are the detector hacking attacks [ 62 ] that break most current qkd implementations , including the checking of the bell inequality in establishing epr pairs [ 63 ] .",

    "the failure probability per bit interpretation is seriously incorrect , as discussed in section iv.a with numerical security levels illustrated in section iii.b .",

    "there are a very large number of papers on security proofs in qkd , many of which are referenced in [ 2 ] .",

    "other security proofs share almost all the difficulties bb84 proofs face and more .",
    "we will summarize at the end a list of problems that no proof in qkd has yet overcome , with the exception of the kcq - dbm approach ; however , the details of why and how that is possible are yet to appear .    it may be noted that security proofs , in qkd or any cryptosystem concerning privacy and key distribution , are a very complicated matter .",
    "errors and incompleteness are to be expected during the early stages of their development .",
    "these theoretical defects can not be glossed over in cryptography , although such defects are often justifiably neglected in physics and engineering when a final working experimental system is what decides success or failure .",
    "security can not be proved experimentally , if only because there are an infinite variety of possible attacks , which can not all be described. there were many surprises in the history of cryptography ; thus, whether there is a valid proof in an important issue , especially in qkd , where provable security appears to be the only real advantage compared to conventional cryptography .    as in the case of many mathematical propositions ,",
    "it is not always possible to produce counter - examples to the main conclusion .",
    "sometimes , the statement is actually true , such as the poincare conjecture and fermat s last theorem , yet a valid proof is a separate matter from assuming the truth . in the body of this paper",
    ", we could only produce counter - examples to specific spots of reasoning in a purported proof .",
    "we did not give a specific attack that would always succeed .",
    "the burden is on those who claim that there is a proof to produce a valid one .",
    "one can always change the proof claim to a plausibility claim , and we need to draw sharp boundaries in cryptography .",
    "the discussions of this appendix should be read with this in mind .      the earliest general bb84 security proofs in [ 13 ] and [ 26 ] are mainly on the security of the sifted key , namely , @xmath26 in fig .",

    "they use the mutual information criterion , which we have shown in section iii.b cannot lead to such a conclusion by its mere vanishing asymptotically. this conclusion could not be drawn with the trace distance @xmath1 going to @xmath80 either ( section iv ) . however , the prevailing impression is that it could , and the issue is not addressed in the recent review [ 2 ] .    _",
    "second _ , there is no treatment of known - plaintext attacks when the generated key is used for encryption .",
    "apparently , the quantum accessible mutual information criterion is not sufficient for proving security against kpas , as discussed in section iv .",
    "a weakened protection against kpas is provided by @xmath1 , as presented in section v.b .    _",
    "third _ , eve s side information from error correction and privacy amplification are not considered and were later addressed in different approaches , as discussed in section vi .",
    "the ecc problem remains to be rigorously treated for any type of qkd protocol , of which we call qkd or otherwise .",

    "for example , coherent detection by eve is ruled out by the qubit model .",
    "loss is ubiquitous in optical systems .",
    "no reason has been offered as to why it would only affect throughput but not security in bb84 , although it is known that it does affect security in b92 [ 1]. see [ 61 ] for further discussions of these and other physics - related security issues .    _",
    "fifth _ , although [ 26 ] is an existence proof among the class of what is called css eccs with associated privacy amplification , it has been widely taken to have proved the ( asymptotic ) security of any specific ecc and any pac .",
    "this error is found later in both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "there are various spots of uncertain validity in the reasoning of these papers .",
    "although they are relevant to security , for the sake of this paper , we can assume that they are valid .",
    "the main concern in this regard is that the issues involved are not purely mathematical but concern the relation of a mathematical statement to its real - world implication .",
    "we have observed some such examples in section iv for cryptographic relations .",
    "it is a special problem for qkd in which quantum physics at the small scale is tied to various classical physical or engineering phenomena .",
    "an important sequel to [ 26 ] is the widely quoted [ 27 ] , which extends [ 26 ] to include various system imperfections by adjusting the final result in [ 20 ] using the attainable key rate with purported asymptotic perfect key generation .",

    "there is no general formulation of the problem including an imperfect feature that would demonstrate how the original proof would address all possible attacks with such imperfection .",
    "the pac in [ 26 ] is a nonlinear hash function ; however , is treated as if it is linear .",
    "this [ 27 ] is used as the basis of the security claim on the use of decoy states for laser instead of single - photon sources ; some problems with such a connection are discussed in [ 61 ] . in particular , it is not realized that a weak laser pulse is itself coherent and not a mere multi - photon qubit [ 61 ] .",
    "ref [ 27 ] is also used in the security claim of the so - called measurement - device - independent approach [ 25 ] .",
    "security proofs for a finite and more specific protocol were developed and culminated in [ 36 ] for lossless bb84 with various imperfections .",
    "many approaches to bounding eve s information on the sifted key @xmath26 have been attempted , therein settling on the  smoothed \" minimum entropy , which is used in numerical evaluations in [ 36 ] .",
    "such smooth entropy is equivalently eve s maximum probability of obtaining @xmath26 but with greater flexibility in terms of giving up some level of security for a higher key rate .",
    "(the use of these smooth entropies can not increase security by lowering the key rate . )",
    "the trace distance criterion @xmath1 is used because the small kpa leak in the example of [ 31 ] was already considered unacceptable , and the incorrect failure probability claim from a @xmath1 guarantee was maintained .",

    "the approach of [ 26 ] is generalized in [ 45 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] for a finite protocol .",
    "it is difficult to assess the formal results in these papers. in [ 52 ] , the same ad hoc formula for ecc information leaks is used in an actual evaluation , as in [ 36]. in a concrete protocol , there is are advantages , only disadvantages , to these css - code - based approaches in addressing the ecc and pac information leak problems as compared to the approach of [ 36 ] .",
    "  we will simply provide some general remarks to indicate certain problems in the qkd experimental literature and will not dwell on specific analysis of the errors in specific papers .",
    "that is a separate subject matter , i.e. , not that of basic security analysis . given the complexity of qkd security analysis , it is a highly nontrivial task to integrate all the components of a protocol for an experimental system .    to begin with , no complete qkd protocol that includes",
    "message authentication and error correction with an imperfect qkd key has been analyzed .",
    "in particular , the message authentication steps are not interlaced with exactly how the bulk of the protocol runs or with what is being authenticated at what time , and the ecc information leak is only considered by an ad hoc formula without considering the relatively large @xmath1 level of the key used to cover its parity check digits .",
    "qkd experiments do not usually concern the entire cryptosystem , the necessary message authentication , or error correction and privacy amplification .",
    "often , a key rate is cited with no security level attached , which is nonsensical for a concrete protocol , as we observed in sections ii - iii .",
    "part of the cause is apparently the use of [ 26 ] , as discussed in the first point of appendix i.a , with the belief that security can be made arbitrarily close to perfect for a given key rate below the threshold formula of [ 26 ] or [ 27 ] .    such key rate results from [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , with or without system imperfections and assuming that they are completely valid , have yet to consider ecc and pac leaks .",
    "more significantly , they are often quoted for a system that employs error correction and privacy amplification methods , which is not a css code .",
    "thus , those formulas so quoted are not relevant because they have never been shown in any way to hold outside of css codes , and even then , such proofs are merely existence proofs and do not pin down the working codes .",
    "the situation is evidently better for the approach of [ 30 ] , the problems of which we have analyzed in the bulk of this paper and briefly mentioned in appendix i.b . even if we assume that everything is valid , the obtainable security level is insufficient , i.e. , @xmath1 is too large for many applications , as discussed in section viii .",
    "although a @xmath1 level guarantee is not complete , it appears to be a useful criterion and needs to be ascertained for any concrete protocol analyzed without giving eve s full success probability profile ( 4 ) .",
    "however , dbm [ 65 ] promises a new direct security approach yet to be made public .",
    "there are three major security analysis problems that have not yet been solved for any qkd protocol , with exceptions noted below .    1 .   in the presence of inevitable losses",
    ", it has not been proved that only throughput is affected but not security .",
    "when using an imperfect key in executing a qkd protocol , it is not known what the error correction information leak would be .",
    "no analysis has ever been given on a full protocol involving message authentication with an imperfect key , therein demonstrating the effects of key imperfection on the security level of the final generated key .",
    "note that point ( 1 ) does not apply to cv - qkd ( continuous variable ) , which is also immune to detector blinding attacks [ 62 ] .",
    "( we do not discuss such very serious hacking problems in this paper .",
    ") however , cv - qkd suffers from other major problems [ 61 ] not found in bb84 .",
    "the recent approach [ 67 ] , which allegedly dispenses with the information - disturbance tradeoff without considering even intercept - resend attacks , is subject to all three points .",
    "the coherent - state kcq approach in [ 5 ] is not subject to points ( 1)-(2 ) and may not require error correction due to its substantially larger signal level . with error correction , the new dbm technique [ 56 ] may be required .",
    "by  conventional ciphers \" , we mean mathematics - based ciphers , which cover essentially all practical ciphers in commercial use [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .",
    "these are different from  classical ciphers \" , which rely on simply classical physics and include physical - noise - based cryptography such as that described in [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and [ 20 ] .",
    "quantum - physics - based cryptography is yet another gene ; however , by qkd , we mean the smaller subset defined in section i with bb84 as representative .",
    "qkd covers key generation and direct encryption with the generated key .",
    "we will compare both to some typical conventional ciphers in current use .",
    "such a comparison is important for assessing the potential , progress , and future of qkd .",
    "qkd has often been contrasted with asymmetric or public key cryptography , which only includes complexity - based security and no information - theoretic security other than that in the sense of ( 7 ) in section iii.a .",
    "however , it is substantially more appropriate to compare qkd with symmetric key ciphers [ 8 ] because a pre - shared secret key is needed to execute a qkd protocol other than for the purpose of agent identification .",
    "message authentication is needed to prevent man - in - the - middle attacks . for this purpose alone",
    ", one would need information theoretically secure message authentication to preserve the overall information - theoretic security of the qkd protocol , which requires a shared secret key .",
    "as shown in section vi , the error correction step of a qkd protocol also requires a pre - shared secret key .",
    "of course , the qkd - generated key represents a pre - shared key for future protocols .",
    "we have shown in section vi how the imperfect security level of such a key prevents a valid security proof and its quantitative level from being obtained .    in this subsection , we will simply make some comments on the contrast between public key cryptography and qkd .",
    "asymmetric key protocols can be used for both key generation and direct encryption for privacy .",
    "they are not used for the latter in practice due to their relative inefficiency compared to symmetric key ciphers .",
    "qkd in practice is more inefficient and more complex to operate compared to asymmetric key ciphers due to a number of fundamental reasons such as low signal levels and inevitable large losses .",
    "they have the advantage of being provably information theoretically secure , which is however not yet realized , as we show in this paper .",
    "the advantage is often claimed that qkd encryption is resistant to future compromise of the secret key in conventional ciphers .",
    "that is surely the case in comparison to asymmetric key ciphers because decryption of the public ciphertext may be obtained in the future based on mere computational power .",
    "however , qkd has no real advantage in this regard compared to symmetric key ciphers because the shared secret key can simply be deleted permanently .",
    "furthermore , when the generated key from qkd is used on a conventional cipher , such a key shares the same problem , if any , as in the case of symmetric key ciphers .",
    "symmetric key ciphers can be used for  key expansion \" , effectively generating new  session keys \" from a master key , or for privacy encryption . when used for key expansion , they are very similar to qkd generation schematically .",
    "they have information - theoretic security because they are similar in their security as the plaintext security under ciphertext - only attacks when the cipher is used for encryption .",
    "specifically , the generated ( running ) key sequence @xmath354 from the cipher with a uniform seed key @xmath355 , which can be regarded as a pseudo random number sequence , would have the following probability of leaking the whole @xmath354 to eve :    @xmath356    this is obtained because each possible @xmath355 value leads to a different @xmath354 sequence ( non - degenerate cipher ) , which may be used in eq .",
    "( 1 ) as the @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to realize that this _ is _ information - theoretic security for @xmath354 , and it is very favorable for typical values of @xmath357 from @xmath358 to @xmath351 , as compared to that obtained from the qkd value ( 50 ) with the @xmath1 values in the literature . for comparison to qkd",
    ", a block cipher can be run in stream cipher mode for the generation of a running key , as in fig",
    "subset leaks @xmath359 depend on the specific conventional cipher . for ( non - degenerate ) linear feedback shift registers [ 3 ]",
    ", the level is perfect for a single @xmath360 sequence of @xmath361 consecutive bits [ 6 ] . in general , the correlations between bits in @xmath354 are difficult to quantify , whereas a qkd key obtains a security guarantee under ( 13 ) . in any case ,",
    "key expansion symmetric key ciphers do not have  perfect forward secrecy\"[3 ] due to the correlations between bits in @xmath354 .",
    "moreover , a qkd - generated key does _ not _ have such secrecy either , especially not at the large @xmath113 level given in the literature , because it is imperfect .",
    "the following numerical comparison of the qkd system of [ 59 ] with only a linear feedback shift register ( lfsr ) cipher against ciphertext - only attacks is revealing . with a seed key of only 128 bits ,",
    "the @xmath362 level of an lfsr is @xmath363 from ( ii.51 ) for any @xmath364 , which compares quite favorably to @xmath365 for @xmath366 bits in [ 59 ] even before the markov inequality is applied for an individual guarantee .",
    "the lsfr protects a segment @xmath102 of up to 128 consecutive bits with perfect security , whereas the system of [ 59 ] only does so at the same @xmath367 level from ( 13 ) .",
    "it is not known what the lsfr information - theoretic security is for many scattered segments @xmath102 , and [ 59 ] gives the same @xmath367 probability for segments within a block from ( 50 ) .",
    "there are many other uncertain securities in both systems .",
    "it is also not clear if one is superior to another security wise .",
    "however , it is clear that the lfsr is substantially faster and cheaper to operate .",
    "the numerical comparison of qkd and symmetric - key ciphers is included in table 1 of section viii.b .    note that there is no kpa in key expansion until the expanded key is used in an application because the plaintext is chosen to be @xmath57 , at least in principle , by the encrypter .",
    "this is why there is information - theoretic security in conventional key expansion before the key is used , given the possibility of kpa .",
    "non - degenerate symmetric key ciphers in current use do not have any kpa information - theoretic security because only a length of @xmath357 known input bits together with the corresponding ciphertext would uniquely fix @xmath355 in principle .",
    "security relies on the complexity of locating @xmath355 . on the other hand ,",
    "the qkd key remains secure for sufficiently small @xmath1 from ( 23 ) .",
    "note that it may be possible to obtain information - theoretic security against kpa with a conventional cipher .",
    "the theoretical possibility is presented in [ 68 , app . ]",
    ", especially when the known plaintext is not too long .",
    "it has been proposed that the qkd generated key can be used as the seed key in a conventional cipher . in that case , the plaintext so encrypted only obtains the protection of the conventional cipher but worse considering that @xmath355 is no longer perfect .",
    "how the imperfection affects the conventional symmetric key cipher security is _",
    "unknown_. in any case , as a pure conventional cipher , there is no more information - theoretic security against kpa .",
    "we believe the following remarks are important when comparing qkd with conventional cipher security . in many specialized applications ,",
    "it does _ not _ seem possible to launch a kpa , in contrast to most commercial applications .",
    "examples include military applications with encryption on board an aircraft , a ship , a satellite , or a protected ground station . in such cases ,",
    "it is not clear what advantage of significance qkd provides compared to conventional encryption , as discussed in the above subsection with a numerical example .",
    "this is especially true given that the qkd security advantage has yet to be rigorously established ; in addition , it is inefficient and is vulnerable to hacking .    more broadly , for such specialized applications , it is not clear why kirchhoff s principle [ 4 ] should be assumed . that principle states that the only security-relevant feature of the cryptosystem that an attacker does not know and that the users do is the shared secret key between the users",
    "the cipher structure and the encryption algorithm are assumed to be openly known .",
    "this does _ not _ appear to be a reasonable assumption in military situations .",
    "if the encryption structure or algorithm is unknown to the attacker , it appears next to impossible for her to obtain substantial amounts of information for any reasonable cipher the users choose because the possibilities between structures and algorithms are endless and equivalent to a huge number of shared secret bits. they can be readily and often changed under software implementations .",
    "even under kpa and kirchoff s principle , there is no known vulnerability of conventional strong ciphers such as aes . in specialized applications , a huge number of seed key bits can be pre - stored .",
    "weaker ciphers are commonly employed due to their efficiency .",
    "the notable security risks are not from the known strong ciphers .",
    "is there a serious problem that awaits qkd as its solution ?",
    "it appears that efficient bulk encryption of large ( elephant ) data flows in optical links is the one clear area that would benefit from efficient qkd .",
    "this appendix addresses some possible objections or concerns on various points of this paper .",
    "+ objection a : security is a matter of definition .",
    "why is your definition better than other ones ?",
    "answer : security is not a matter of definition .",
    "the cryptosystem designer must decide on an acceptable probability of a successful attack by eve on any characteristic of the generated key @xmath2 from a qkd round .",
    "consider for example @xmath2 of length @xmath337 bits .",
    "if eve has a total compromise probability @xmath368 ( for @xmath369 ) of correctly identifying the entire @xmath2 , which is substantially larger than the uniform level of @xmath370 , is this acceptable ?",
    "suppose that it is not ; then , regardless of the security definition used at any quantitative level , security is not guaranteed if the total compromise probability above is not ruled out .",
    "this is formalized by the operational guarantee statement ( og ) in section iii.a .",
    "a theoretic security criterion has to yield operational probability guarantees , which must be the concern of cryptographic security .",
    "such an operational guarantee is difficult to obtain and has been ignored in qkd , except through the incorrect failure probability interpretation discussed in detail in section iv .",
    "it is also neglected in some but not all information - theoretic security studies in conventional cryptography .    in this paper , we detailed some basic operational guarantees for the trace distance ( statistical distance ) criterion @xmath1 ; however , not all important operational guarantees have been covered by @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , eve s ber , discussed in section v.b , is not covered .",
    "when eve identifies @xmath2 incorrectly as a sequence , she may still correctly obtain , say , 60% of the bits , similar to the case whereby the distribution @xmath333 is known to eve with a per bit error probability of 0.6 , which would not be considered a secure key by most designers .",
    "most designers would want a proof against such a possibility at any designed ber level .",
    "there are questions concerning the average versus worst - case guarantee , average versus individual guarantee , and security of multiple uses of different keys at given d levels .",
    "these questions are discussed in section iii.a , v.c , and viii.b as well as in the following objections b and c. note that eq .",
    "( 50 ) with @xmath369 implies that many bits and bit segments may be leaked for operation in one , say , at a key rate of 1 mbps ; see section viii .",
    "+ objection b : the average instead of the worst case should be employed in quantifying security leaks .",
    "answer : for a rigorous assessment of a problem on performance depending on a parameter @xmath371 , usually , only a relevant upper or lower bound can be obtained over the range of values that @xmath371 may take .",
    "the worst - case performance , say , concerning the time complexity of an algorithm or the security level of a cryptosystem provides a guaranteed level of performance that may or may not result from an attack but that can not be exceeded . if the parameter @xmath371 has a probability distribution , one can also discuss the average performance ; see objection c.    however , it may not be meaningful , in the sense of being applicable to reality , to assign a probability distribution to what is called a  _ nonrandom parameter _ \" [ 39 ] , which is not described by a probability distribution .",
    "this may occur when the parameter appears in only one sample instance with no repeated trials ( although there remains meaning to assign probability to such a situation in various theories of probability [ 41 ] , such as the probability that president john kennedy was shot by more than one gunman .",
    "the warren commission addressed such question .",
    "see also objection c. ) in decision theory , an unknown nonrandom parameter [39 ] is then used .",
    "this often happens , for example , when the parameter takes on a continuum of possibility .    in this paper ,",
    "the unknown parameter is @xmath37 , namely , eve s distribution on the generated key @xmath2 from her attack , as presented in section iii.a as well as in the beginning of section iv .",
    "the function is the parameter @xmath371 under consideration , the range of which has a cardinality of the continuum .",
    "more significantly, eve can pick any attack for which there is no distribution , and in any event , the users do not know the distribution or if one exists .",
    "thus , we can not average over @xmath37 or @xmath58 , the maximum value of @xmath37 from eq .",
    "we also can not average over the @xmath45 of a specific @xmath37 even though that may make sense if only because we do not know the value of that specific @xmath37 .",
    "thus , we have to bound @xmath58 as the worst case to provide a valid guarantee .",
    "+ objection c : an average can be used for the guarantee instead of a probability . in particular , there is no need to apply a markov inequality to convert an average guarantee into an individual guarantee .",
    "answer : some parameters in qkd do have reasonable probability distributions , although only for a given attack in a given round .",
    "thus , the choice of pac is taken to be uniform . the known part @xmath63 to eve of @xmath2 in a kpa",
    "is specified by the marginal distribution of @xmath2 from the joint distribution @xmath372 with eve s observation @xmath14 . in section v.c , we detailed the main reasons why a probabilistic guarantee is more accurate than an average guarantee .",
    "one reason is that the average has no operational meaning when the total number of trials ( pertaining to that underlying distribution ) is small , similar to the single - trial case .",
    "( think of the above kennedy assassination example in objection b. ) this is codified in the statement ( og ) in section iii.a on operational guarantees .",
    "equally significantly , a finite sample average remains a random quantity with its own probability distribution .",
    "a probability statement can be made on it to satisfy ( og ) .",
    "for example , an estimate from variance information could lead to such an estimate , not further information on the distribution .",
    "the markov inequality estimates ( 30 ) and ( 33 ) from the average alone are weak because no other statistical information is available .",
    "one may be stuck with a weaker guarantee , such as the average without a probability statement , and even simply relying on a single theoretic criterion without analyzing its proper operational meaning , as has been the case in qkd until now , if that is all one can obtain . however , comparing quantitative security on various characteristics of @xmath2 to the uniform @xmath57 is the concern of rigorous security .",
    "a uniform @xmath23 gives far better and far more detailed security guarantees than does a trace distance guarantee , especially at the relatively large level that can be obtained . at the very least",
    ", it can not be claimed that the qkd - generated key is  perfect \" , can be made as close to perfect as desired , or is perfect except for a small probability .",
    "the many problems presented in this paper should make clear the dangers of such an exaggeration .",
    "+ objection d : distinguishability advantage is a great criterion in cryptography .",
    "is there a definite counter - example on why it is not satisfactory ?",
    "answer : distinguishability advantage is a vague and very misleadingly phrased security guarantee . as detailed in section iv.b , it leads to the an incorrect failure probability interpretation of a statistical distance guarantee ( which the trace distance criterion reduces to upon eve s measurement on her probe ) as a definite and general quantitative consequence .",
    "alone , it serves no purpose other than what is given mathematically , namely , a bound on the statistical distance .",
    "in particular , there can be no counter - example until one gives the quantitative guarantee that derives from distinguishability advantage . using the failure probability interpretation as its consequence , all the counter - examples to the failure probability interpretation are counter - examples to the distinguishability advantage interpretation .",
    "these include the examples in section iv.a and the kpa counter - example in section v.a .",
    "distinguishability advantage as a statistical distance bound on @xmath103 is a useful criterion , as demonstrated by this paper .",

    "( 13 ) that results is the same for a one - bit subsequence @xmath102 of @xmath2 as it is for the whole @xmath373 .",
    "this may give the impression that the cryptosystem is substantially more secure than it actually is and apparently led to the incorrect failure probability per bit interpretation discussed in section iv.a , which grossly overestimates security .",
    "+ objection e : is nt your kpa counter - example of section v.a not one of known - plaintext attack but one of chosen - plaintext attack ?",
    "answer : there is no difference between kpas and chosen - plaintext attacks for the symmetric key additive stream ciphers of fig . 1 , and the counter - example concerns such a cipher .",
    "this is because the additive key stream in symmetric key ciphers is blind to the data .",
    "a kpa reveals part of the running key @xmath194 that happens to be uncovered from the known data @xmath237 , with the following @xmath195 depending on @xmath194 and @xmath37 .",
    "of course , the @xmath103 level provides an average guarantee over @xmath63 , as given in eq .",
    "thus , a bad @xmath194 can only occur with a small probability for small @xmath103 ( which @xmath1 reduces to ) .",
    "however , such an average needs to be removed for an individual guarantee .",
    "the incorrect failure probability interpretation produces an incorrect answer for a given @xmath194 ; see section v.a .",
    "+ objection f : the trace distance guarantee may be sufficient in practice .",
    "what is the evidence to the contrary ?",
    "answer : this paper is concerned with information - theoretic security foundation and rigorous proofs of security , the latter being proclaimed for qkd for almost twenty years .",
    "it is not clear what is meant by  sufficient in practice \" , which would vary from application to application .",
    "many problems , including the lack of a real proof on qkd security , are noted in this paper .",
    "they constitute evidence of possible practical security problems .",
    "there is no such thing as proof by  no counter - example yet \" .",
    "the burden is on those who claim qkd has been proved secure to produce a valid proof for a given model. it is the task of cryptanalysis , a major component of cryptology , to scrutinize security , which is rarely performed in the qkd literature apart from implementation issues .",
    "+ objection g : why can not security be brought arbitrarily close to perfect by privacy amplification ?",
    "answer : the trace distance level @xmath113 is bounded by ( 36 ) in terms of the total compromise probability @xmath255 of the shift key @xmath28 .",

    "it is not known whether there is any way to make only @xmath60 arbitrarily close to the uniform level @xmath258 ; see section vi.a .",
    "in addition , note from sections iii.b and iv before iv.a that asymptotic vanishing of eve s accessible information or the trace distance not only does _ not _ imply that the key is arbitrarily close to perfect but also may even imply that the key suffers from a serious weakness of having a very relatively large @xmath60 .",
    "+ objection h : there is no problem in assigning a numerical value to @xmath264 in the error correction cost ( 39 ) .",
    "this can be taken from the actual ecc used in the protocol.    answer : in that case , there is then no need to present formula ( 39 ) , which is irrelevant to the actual bit cost .",
    "this conveys the misleading impression that there is a general justification .    as outlined in section vi.b",
    ", there is a rationale for ( 39 ) when @xmath268 because of the asymptotic number of bits needed to cover a linear ecc for guaranteed error correction , although only for a binary symmetric channel , which is not obtained under a general attack .",
    "the point is that correctness of the round ( the users agree on the same key ) is then guaranteed .",
    "when a finite code is used with usually a bit cost of even less than ( 39 ) for @xmath268 , correctness from an ecc can not be theoretically guaranteed and must be established with high probability by other means not given in the security proof of the protocol .",
    "this is acceptable in practice whenever it works but can not be confused with a security proof on the model .",
    "the assumption must at least be made clear that it is not logically incorporated in the security proof .",
    "the more serious problem with error correction is what is focused on in section vi.b ; it has not been quantitatively shown how an imperfect key covering the ecc would degrade security or why the imperfect key bit cost of any quantitative level can be used to account for any bit leaks in any reconciliation procedure .",
    "many unstated and strictly invalid assumptions are used in qkd security proofs , as outlined in this paper and in [ 61 ] , any of which would invalidate any claim to proven security .",
    "the security of qkd protocols requires a substantial amount of further careful study .",
    "objection i : it has not been explained how an imperfect key would affect qkd security when used for error correction and what the overall complexity security becomes when used in a conventional symmetric - key cipher .",
    "answer : the first question is a major open problem in qkd security theory .",
    "the second occurs when a qkd key is used in ciphers such as aes ; however , it is not very relevant because an imperfect key can only weaken the complexity security compared to a uniform key .",
    "the substantive question is what the complexity security becomes if the imperfect seed key is changed more often compared to a uniform key .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that an attacker s success probabilities are the fundamental criteria of security that any theoretic security criterion must relate to in order to have operational significance . </S>",
    "<S> the errors committed in the prevalent interpretation of the trace distance criterion are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the security proofs of qkd protocols are discussed and assessed in regard to three main features : their validity , completeness , and adequacy of the achieved numerical security level . </S>",
    "<S> problems are identified in all these features . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the qkd security situation is quite different from the common perception that a qkd - generated key is nearly perfectly secure . </S>",
    "<S> built into our discussion is a simple but complete quantitative description of the information theoretic security of classical key distribution that is also applicable to the quantum situation . in the appendices , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a brief outline of the history of some major qkd security proofs , a rather unfavorable comparison of current qkd proven security with that of conventional symmetric key ciphers , and a list of objections and answers concerning some major points of the paper .    </S>",
