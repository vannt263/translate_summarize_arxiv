    "it came as a surprise when t hooft @xcite observed in 1976 that because of the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly the standard model does not absolutely conserve baryon and lepton number .",
    "the process t hooft considered was spontaneous fermion number violation due to instanton induced transitions .",
    "later ringwald @xcite argued , that such tunnelling transitions between topologically distinct vacua might be observable at high energies at future accelerators .",
    "the presence of baryon and lepton number violating processes in the standard model was considered by manton @xcite from another point of view .",
    "he investigated the topological structure of the configuration space of weinberg - salam theory and found the existence of noncontractible loops . from these he predicted the existence of a static , unstable solution of the bosonic field equations , representing the top of the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua .",
    "because of its instability this classical electroweak solution was termed sphaleron by klinkhamer and manton @xcite .    at finite temperature",
    "the energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations of the fields , and baryon number violating vacuum to vacuum transitions involving changes of baryon and lepton number can occur .",
    "the rate for such baryon number violating processes is largely determined by a boltzmann factor , containing the height of the barrier at a given temperature and thus the energy of the sphaleron @xcite .",
    "entailing baryon number violating processes , the sphaleron itself carries baryon number @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the energy of the sphaleron increases with increasing higgs mass and ranges roughly between 7 and 13 tev @xcite .",
    "the energy is that high , since its scale is not set by @xmath1 but by @xmath2 . for the physical value of the weak mixing angle",
    "the sphaleron energy is only slightly decreased as compared to vanishing mixing angle @xcite .",
    "however , the configuration is no longer spherically symmetric , and retains only axial symmetry . at the same time",
    ", one finds a large value for the magnetic dipole moment of the sphaleron @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "whereas the static electroweak sphaleron does not carry electric charge , it was argued before @xcite and demonstrated recently in nonperturbative studies @xcite , that the addition of electric charge leads to a non - vanishing poynting vector and thus a finite angular momentum density of the system .",
    "consequently , a branch of electrically charged sphalerons arises , that carry at the same time angular momentum .",
    "in particular , their angular momentum and charge are proportional .",
    "since these charged sphalerons carry non - vanishing baryon number as well , they can also entail baryon number violating processes .    beside the sphaleron ,",
    "the non - trivial topology of the configuration space of weinberg - salam theory gives rise to further unstable classical solutions .",
    "a superposition of @xmath4 sphalerons , for instance , can lead to static axially symmetric solutions , multisphalerons , which carry baryon number @xmath5 and whose energy density is torus - like @xcite .",
    "a superposition of a sphaleron and an antisphaleron , on the other hand , can give rise to a bound sphaleron - antisphaleron system , in which a sphaleron and an antisphaleron are located at an equilibrium distance on the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "such a sphaleron - antisphaleron pair has vanishing baryon number , @xmath6 , since the antisphaleron carries @xmath7 .",
    "the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair therefore does not mediate baryon number violating processes .",
    "recently , the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair solutions have been generalized , leading to sphaleron - antisphaleron chains , where @xmath8 sphalerons and antisphalerons are located on the symmetry axis in static equilibrium @xcite , in close analogy to the monopole - antimonopole chains encountered in the georgi - glashow model @xcite .",
    "when systems of multisphalerons and -antisphalerons are considered , instead of the anticipated pairs and chains a new type of solutions arises , when @xmath9 @xcite . in these vortex ring solutions the higgs field vanishes not ( only ) on isolated points on the symmetry axis but ( also ) on one or more rings , centered around the symmetry axis @xcite .    in this paper",

    ", the non - vanishing poynting vector leads to a finite angular momentum density for these configurations .",
    "thus branches of rotating electrically charged sphaleron - antisphaleron systems emerge from the respective static electrically neutral configurations .",

    "we present the action , the ansatz for the stationary axially symmetric configurations , and the boundary conditions .",
    "we then consider the relevant physical properties and , in particular , derive the linear relation between angular momentum and electric charge .",
    "we present and discuss the numerical results in section 3 .",
    "these include global properties of the solutions , such as their energy , their angular momentum , their charge and their magnetic moments , but also local properties , such as their energy density , their angular momentum density and the modulus of their higgs field .",

    "their location depends on @xmath4 and on the parameters . with increasing @xmath4",
    "these tori degenerate forming basically a single cylinder . as before",
    ", the effect of the presence of electric charge is that the energy density spreads further out , while at the same time its overall magnitude reduces .",
    "likewise , the effect of the presence of angular momentum is a centrifugal shift of the energy density . with increasing angular momentum the torus - like regions of large energy density move further outward to larger values of @xmath119 .",
    "the modulus of the higgs field of the sphaleron - antisphaleron systems changes only little with increasing charge and angular momentum .",
    "indeed the change is barely noticeable in these figures , even though the static systems are compared to those that carry maximal charge and angular momentum .",
    "we therefore address the effect on the nodes of the higgs field separately in fig .",
    "[ f-12 ] , where we exhibit for the system @xmath100 , @xmath146 the modulus of the higgs field in the equatorial plane with increasing charge parameter @xmath147 .",
    "the effect on the size of the ring is an increase of roughly 10% due to charge and rotation . for comparison we also exhibit the modulus of the higgs field on the @xmath148-axis , choosing the system @xmath128 , @xmath120 , where the nodes are pointlike .",
    "here we observe an increase of the distance between the nodes also on the order of 10% due to charge and rotation .",
    "[ f-12 ]    the angular momentum density of the sphaleron - antisphaleron systems is also characterized by the presence of tori .",
    "there are tori of large positive angular momentum density as well as negative angular momentum density .",
    "the tori of the angular momentum density are spatially related to the tori of the energy density . in particular ,",
    "the location of the positive tori is associated with the location of the tori of the energy density , with the negative tori inbetween .",
    "let us finally address the question of the equilibrium of such composite configurations as sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs and more general sphaleron - antisphaleron systems .",
    "as discussed previously @xcite , a necessary condition for the equilibrium of such axially symmetric configurations is @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the respective component of the stress energy tensor and @xmath151 is the equatorial plane .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , the net force between the constituents in the upper and in the lower hemisphere vanishes , thus yielding equilibrium .",
    "if @xmath150 vanishes everywhere in the equatorial plane , this condition is met trivially , if on the other hand @xmath150 does not identically vanish , the various contributions to the surface integral ( [ tzz ] ) must precisely cancel each other .    to understand how the equilibrium condition is satisfied in these sphaleron - antisphaleron systems ,",
    "we have extracted the @xmath150 component of the stress energy tensor .",
    "we illustrate @xmath150 for two rather different configurations in fig .",
    "[ f-13 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f-13]a we display @xmath150 for the static sphaleron - antisphaleron chain with @xmath135 , @xmath38 in the upper hemisphere .",
    "in the equatorial plane @xmath150 appears to almost vanish .",
    "we therefore focus on the equatorial plane in fig .",
    "[ f-13]c . here",
    "@xmath150 is small , but finite ( except when it changes sign ) . to gain further insight into how the equilibrium results from the various forces present in the system , we consider the contributions from the respective parts of the lagrangian separately .",
    "we exhibit these also in fig .",
    "we note , that the positive contribution from the @xmath18 gauge field part almost cancels the negative contributions from the @xmath19 and higgs parts , yielding in total a @xmath150 which is almost but not quite vanishing in the equatorial plane . in the inner region",
    "the total @xmath150 is slightly positive , while in the outer region it is slightly negative , yielding together a vanishing surface integral ( [ tzz ] ) , within the numerical accuracy .",
    "the situation is similar for other sphaleron - antisphaleron chains with even @xmath8 and @xmath38 , including the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair .",
    "also , the inclusion of rotation does not change this overall behaviour of these types of solutions . for most other systems , however , @xmath150 does not nearly vanish in the equatorial plane .",
    "this is exhibited exemplarily in fig .",
    "[ f-13]b for the fast rotating sphaleron - antisphaleron system with @xmath100 , @xmath146 .",
    "the features of @xmath150 seen here , are very typical , and hardly change with rotation , since the effect of rotation is basically a slight shift in magnitude .",
    "however , while @xmath150 is rather large in the equatorial plane for these configurations , its positive and negative contributions to the surface integral do cancel as required for equilibrium .",
    "[ f-13 ]    \\(a ) ( b ) + ( c ) ( d )",
    "we have considered sphaleron - antisphaleron pairs , chains and vortex ring solutions in weinberg - salam theory , which are characterized by two integers @xmath4 and @xmath8 . starting from the respective neutral electroweak configurations ,",
    "we have obtained the corresponding branches of rotating electrically charged solutions .",
    "these branches exist up to maximal values of the charge and angular momentum , beyond which localized solutions are no longer possible .",
    "we have performed a complete study of all configurations with @xmath152 and @xmath153 , fixing the weak mixing angle at its physical value and taking a fixed value of the higgs mass .",
    "the chain configurations with @xmath130 and @xmath38 have only partially been obtained with sufficiently high accuracy , to include their global properties such as their energy and magnetic moment into our systematic survey . for these chains",
    "our efforts are still continuing .    on the other hand , in order to clarify the evolution of the nodal structure of these sphaleron - antisphaleron systems , we have gone to rather high values of @xmath4 , for static configurations , while extrapolating from the full study that the nodal structure is not much affected by the presence of charge and rotation .",
    "in particular , we have observed that the various rings in the vortex ring configurations tend to increase in size linearly with @xmath4 , while at the same time tending to merge into a single ring in the equatorial plane . for @xmath127",
    "this merging transition occurs at @xmath111 , and for @xmath128 at @xmath139 , while for the even @xmath8 cases 4 and 6 the expected merging may occur only beyond @xmath138 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath57 and the charge @xmath66 of these sphaleron - antisphaleron systems are proportional @xmath154 their energy and binding energy increase with increasing rotation , and so does their magnetic moment . with increasing charge",
    "the energy density of the configurations spreads further out , while its overall magnitude reduces . at the same time",
    "the effect of the rotation is a centrifugal shift of the energy density tori to larger radii .",
    "we have also addressed the equilibrium condition ( [ tzz ] ) for these sphaleron - antisphaleron systems . in all systems , it is the surface integral that vanishes to give equilibrium , and not the stress - energy tensor component @xmath150 by itself . however , for the sphaleron - antisphaleron pair ( and other even @xmath8 chains ) the stress - energy tensor component @xmath150 almost vanishes in the equatorial plane . in these configurations",
    "the positive contribution from the @xmath18 part almost cancels the negative contributions from the @xmath19 and higgs parts , thus yielding an almost vanishing total @xmath150 in the equatorial plane .",
    "the next step will be to study the fermion modes in the background of rotating electroweak configurations to understand their relevance for baryon number violating processes @xcite",
    ". moreover it will be interesting to include the effect of gravitation @xcite to obtain rotating gravitating regular configurations as well as black hole solutions . here",
    "a fascinating possibility would be the existence of a pair of black holes kept apart by the non - abelian interactions between the sphaleron and antisphaleron configurations without the need for a conical singularity .",
