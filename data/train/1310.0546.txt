    ", one can represent a braid by a collection of smooth curves in @xmath5 called a _ curve diagram _ ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter x ) ) .",
    "although the curve diagram representation is elementary , it reflects various deep properties of braids in a surprisingly simple way .",
    "for example , a curve diagram provides a geometric interpretation of the dehornoy ordering of the braid groups @xcite , and one can read both the classical and the dual garside lengths from the curve diagram @xcite in a direct manner . moreover , a certain simplifying procedure of curve diagrams provides a combinatorial model of the teichmller distance @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to develop a theory of curve diagram for other groups that act on surfaces .    in the framework of the theory of artin groups ,",
    "the braid group @xmath1 is treated as an artin group corresponding to the dynkin diagram of type @xmath6 . in this paper",

    "the group @xmath7 is given by the presentation @xmath9    in this paper , we develop a theory of curve diagram for artin groups of type b. we introduce two labelings on curve diagrams , the _ winding number labeling _ and the _ wall - crossing labeling _ by generalizing the corresponding notions in the curve diagram of braids .    in theorem [ theorem : lengthformula_c ] and theorem [ theorem :",
    "lengthformula_dual ] , we show that from these labelings one can read the _ classical garside length _ and the _ dual garside length _ of @xmath7",
    ". these are length functions of @xmath7 with respect to certain natural generating sets called the _ classical simple elements _ and the _ dual simple elements _ , respectively .",
    "our main theorems provide a geometric and topological interpretation of such standard length functions .",
    "the classical and the dual simple elements come from natural garside structures on @xmath7 . here",
    "a garside structure is a combinatorial and algebraic structure which produces an effectively computable normal form that solves the word and the conjugacy problems .",
    "an idea of garside structure dates back to garside s solution of the word and the conjugacy problem of the braid groups @xcite .",

    "our requirement of algebraic properties for the classical and the dual simple elements , stated as lemma [ lemma : keyproperty ] and lemma [ lemma : keyproperty_d ] respectively , are much weaker than the requirement in developing garside theory .",
