    "controlling and optimizing the mechanical transports of electrolyte solutions in confined geometries have become increasingly important in recent remarkable developments of electrochemical devices . particularly at the scale of nanometer , novel transport properties in the vicinity of surfaces emerge because of the large surface / volume ratio , which have potential applications in various fields , such as energy conversion  @xcite , water desalination  @xcite , and fluidic transistor  @xcite . in order to prompt the development of electrochemical devices using the electrokinetic transports , comprehensive understanding of the transport properties is required .    in the context of electrokinetic transports , it is common to focus on the mass flow of the solution @xmath0 and the electric current @xmath1 induced by the pressure gradient @xmath2 and the electric field @xmath3  @xcite , which are related through the linear relations : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the physical transport coefficients .",
    "note that this equation is valid only in the linear - response regime , i.e. , the system is close to the thermal equilibrium state such that it responds linearly to the external fields .",
    "we have recently studied the @xmath0 and @xmath6 of an electrolyte solution in a nano - channel using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , showing that a green  kubo approach based on the linear - response theory and the non - equilibrium md ( nemd ) simulation method yield consistent results in a wide range of the external field strengths  @xcite . along with @xmath0 and @xmath6",
    ", however , the solute flux is also a very important transport property , and so is the external field of the solute concentration gradient .",
    "indeed , an outstanding energy - conversion method utilizing the diffusio - osmotic current induced by the concentration gradient has recently been proposed  @xcite . in the present study , to realize a systematic investigation into the electrokinetic transports covering the latter",
    ", we formulate the transport phenomena in a more general manner than eq .   starting from the classical theory of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , and apply the scheme to a specific system of a nano - confined electrolyte solution .",
    "we consider an electrolyte solution consisting of three components , namely , a solvent , a cation , and an anion .",
    "then the system responses to the external forces due to the chemical potential gradients of each component , in the linear - response regime , are written in the following form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denotes the molar fluxes of the solvent , cation , and anion , respectively , and @xmath11 is the force per mole representing the chemical potential gradient .",
    "the transport coefficients are evaluated from the time - correlation function of the fluctuated fluxes @xmath8 at thermal equilibrium , through the green  kubo formula derived from linear - response theory  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the system volume , @xmath14 is the temperature , and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant . in a system with a microscopic dynamics that is invariant under time reversal ,",
    "the correlation @xmath16 is statistically identical to @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the relation @xmath18 holds , which is known as onsager s reciprocal relation  @xcite .",
    "the matrix in eq .",
    "is thus symmetric , and the number of independent coefficients in eq .",
    "is six .",
    "once the six coefficients @xmath19 have been estimated , all the transports phenomena in the electrolyte solution in response to a weak external force are covered . in experiments , however , one usually measures fluxes that are different from the @xmath8 set . note that since the degree of freedom of the three component system is three , there should be three fluxes characterizing the transport phenomena , which are expressed in terms of linear combination of @xmath8 .",
    "a set of fluxes that is commonly used in experiments consists of the mass flow @xmath0 , the electric current @xmath6 , and the solute flux @xmath20 .",
    "these fluxes are expressed in terms of the component fluxes @xmath8 in the following form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mass per mole , @xmath23 is the unit charge , @xmath24 is the valence , and @xmath25 is the avogadro number .",
    "the corresponding external fields are then the pressure gradient @xmath2 , the electric field @xmath3 , and the gradient of the solute chemical potential , denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the relation among these external fields and @xmath11 is @xmath27 the fluxes @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath20 that linearly respond to the external fields @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath26 are then written in the following form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the matrices in eqs .   and , respectively . note that onsager s reciprocal relations are preserved in this transformation ( @xmath32 . ) in addition to the components of @xmath33 matrix appearing in eq .",
    ", the physical parameters in relation to @xmath20 and @xmath26 are included in @xmath34 ; for instance , @xmath35 corresponds to the diffusio - osmotic current , and @xmath36 to the electro - osmotic diffusion . although one might choose different set of fluxes than @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath20 , depending on the experimental setup , once the generic transport coefficients in eq .",
    "are evaluated , all the physical parameters characterizing the transport phenomena are obtained straightforwardly , the mapping @xmath31 above serving as an example .",
    "for instance , one can easily , by an appropriate transformation , define the appropriate transport coefficients in a situation in which one of the ionic currents is blocked while the second one is nonzero .",

    "we apply the formulation described in the previous section to a system consisting of an aqueous nacl solution confined between two parallel charged surfaces as shown in fig .",

    "the generic transport coefficients are readily transformed into the physical parameters that are relevant in the situation under which the measurements are performed .",
    "since the most common set of observable quantities for the confined electrolyte solution is @xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath20 introduced above , we carry out the nemd simulations and numerically obtain these fluxes to ensure that the transformation of the transport coefficients works , and to examine the limit of the linear - response assumption .",

    "recently we have shown the occurrence of the reversal of the electro - osmotic flow , as well as its reciprocal streaming current , in the linear - response regime  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the surface charge density , importance of the concentration of the added salt on the transport properties was also implied in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we examine systematically the influence of the added salt . specifically , maintaining the surface charge density at @xmath45 and @xmath92c / m@xmath44 , the concentration of the added salt is varied by controlling the number of excess pairs of na@xmath47 and cl@xmath48 .     in figs .",

    "[ fig03 ] , and it ranges from @xmath96 to @xmath97 m in fig .  [ fig04 ] .",
    "the weak dependence of @xmath98 on the salt concentration indicates that the rate of the pressure - driven poiseuille - type flow is not influenced significantly , implying the weak variation of the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte solution in this parameter range .",
    "the coefficients @xmath99 and @xmath100 , corresponding respectively to the electrical conductivity and the salt diffusivity , increase as the salt concentration due to the increase of the carrier , and so does @xmath101 .",

    "[ fig04](b ) ) , the values of @xmath102 ( and @xmath103 ) , and @xmath35 ( and @xmath36 ) become negative for high concentrations ( @xmath104 m ) , meaning that , in addition to the the electro - osmotic flow and the streaming current , the diffusio - osmotic current ( response of @xmath6 to @xmath75 ) and its reciprocal electro - osmotic diffusion ( response of @xmath20 to @xmath73 ) are anomalously reversed . here , we note that the matrix @xmath34 maintains the positive definiteness for all cases . the fluxes obtained via eq .  , corresponding to @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , at @xmath105 m are shown in fig .",

    "the existence of the negative net charge in the mobile region also explains the reversed diffusio - osmotic current and electro - osmotic diffusion .",
    "although the average concentration of the counter - ions compensating the surface charge is large , most of them condense at the charged surface and do not respond to the diffusion force or to the electric field . as a result",
    ", the number of co - ions accumulating in the mobile region exceeds that of counter - ions there , which causes diffusio - osmotic current and electro - osmotic diffusion in the direction opposite to the usual ones .",

    "we have described the transformation of the generic transport coefficients @xmath19 for a confined electrolyte solution into the physical transport coefficients @xmath5 , which preserves onsager s reciprocal relation .",
    "applicability of the transformation has been demonstrated by using the equilibrium and nemd simulations for the system of an aqueous nacl solution confined in a charged nano - channel .",
    "the generic coefficients are obtainable in the standard framework of equilibrium molecular dynamics and green  kubo formula , while the physical ones are more naturally obtained using the nemd simulations in the limit of small external fields .",
    "the influence of the salt concentration on the transport coefficients has been investigated at two values of the surface charge densities .",
    "our results are expected to be generic , and provide important information for the design of electrochemical devices using nano - porous media .",
    "furthermore , anomalous reversal of the diffusio - osmotic current , as well as the reversal of the electro - osmotic flow , at high surface charge density and high concentration of added salt , has been shown to occur in the linear - response regime .",
    "the usefulness of the transformation would be more pronounced for complex systems with larger number of chemical components in the solution , because any physical parameters of interest in an experimental setup are immediately obtained via the transformation from the generic transport coefficients , which are evaluated in a straightforward manner simply using the fluxes of each component as shown in eq .  .",
