    "one of the most challenging problems in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to explain the observed enhancement of singly strange and multistrange hadrons .",
    "the shorter equilibration times for strange quarks in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) than the strange hadrons in hadronic matter had led to the conjecture @xcite that enhanced production of ( multi)strange hadrons might be an indication of qgp formation in the early stage of the collision .",
    "however , a firm conclusion of strangeness enhancement as a signal for the qgp can only be established if baseline hadronic processes fail to explain the strange particle abundances . for the singly - strange kaons and lambdas , it was found that the observed enhancement at both the ags @xcite and the sps @xcite energies could indeed be understood within a hadronic scenario @xcite .",
    "this scenario , on the other hand , can not explain the enhanced production of the multistrange @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( and their antiparticles ) observed in pb+pb collisions at sps energies @xcite .",
    "the latter enhancement has thus been associated with production mechanisms which include possible qgp formation@xcite .",
    "the doubly strange @xmath2 has also been measured in heavy ion collisions at the ags @xcite .",
    "compared to that expected from primary nucleon - nucleon collisions , the observed enhancement is even more pronounced than in the sps experiments .",
    "although this is not surprising as experimental data have shown that the ratio of strange to nonstrange particles ( such as @xmath4 ) in a+a relative to p+p collisions increases gradually from rhic energy to lower beam energies at sis @xcite , it is interesting to find out if the measured @xmath2 yield in this collision is consistent with the hadronic or the qgp scenario . in this paper , we shall study the production of multistrange @xmath0 from au+au collisions at the ags energy of @xmath5 gev using the relativistic hadronic transport model art @xcite .",
    "we shall show that strangeness - exchange reactions between the antikaon and lambda(sigma ) in hadronic matter alone can explain the measured @xmath2 yield @xcite , and exotic processes for multistrange particle production at the ags energies are thus not required .",
    "the art model is a hadronic transport model that includes baryons such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and mesons such as @xmath12 .",
    "both elastic and inelastic collisions among most of these particles are included by using the experimental data from hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the art model has been quite successful in explaining many experimental observations , including the surprisingly large kaon antiflow @xcite in heavy ion collisions at ags energies .",
    "the art model also allows us to understand whether or not the strongly interacting matter formed in these collisions reaches chemical and/or thermal equilibrium . in the present study ,",
    "we extend the art model to include perturbatively the @xmath2 particle as in the studies for other rare particles using the transport model @xcite .    in hadronic matter",
    ", the @xmath2 particle is mainly produced via the strangeness - exchange reactions @xmath13 because the contribution from the associated production reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are okubo - zweig - iizuka suppressed . since there is no empirical information on the strangeness - exchange reaction for @xmath2 production , we use the cross section obtained from the gauged flavor @xmath16-invariant lagrangian in the coupled - channel approach @xcite . because the large threshold for final states with the @xmath17 particle , only the reactions @xmath13 are considered here .",
    "writing the spin- and isospin - averaged cross sections for these reactions as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are initial antikaon and final pion momenta in the center - of - mass system , the theoretical cross sections of ref.@xcite are found to be well fitted by the following squared invariant matrix elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite : @xmath23 in the above , the threshold energy @xmath24 in the center - of mass system is 1.611 gev and 1.688 gev for the reactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we note that except near threshold , these cross sections are of the order of @xmath27-@xmath28 .    the cross sections for the inverse reactions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which are needed for treating @xmath2 annihilation , are related to those for @xmath2 production by the principle of detailed balance , i.e. , @xmath31    we have also included the production of the resonance @xmath32 via the reaction @xmath33 , and its cross section is given by a breit - wigner form with the empirical width of @xmath34 mev .",
    "the cross section for the inverse reaction of @xmath32 decay , i.e. , @xmath35 , is also obtained from the detailed balance relation .",
    "figure [ tevol ] displays the time evolution of midrapidity hadrons and the central density obtained in the art model for central au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev .",
    "the abundances for baryon resonances ( left panel ) attain peak values at the maximum compression stage of collision at a time @xmath36 fm / c after the initial contact of the colliding nuclei . during subsequent decompression ,",
    "the resonances decay to produce the stable nucleons and pions .",
    "the kaons produced from baryon - baryon and pion - baryon collisions in art model , tends to saturate soon after the maximum compression stage ( right panel ) .",
    "on the other hand , the antikaon yield steadily decreases during the expansion stage due to their strong absorption with the abundant nucleons at the ags energies via @xmath37 .",
    "the hyperons ( @xmath38 plus their respective resonances ) are produced within 8 fm / c when the density is high .",
    "thereafter , the abundances are rather insensitive to hadronic scatterings , if any .",
    "we find that the strangeness - exchange reactions between antikaons and hyperons lead to an appreciable production of @xmath2 .    the time and spatial distribution of midrapidity particles at freeze - out",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ frzout ] .",
    "most of the @xmath2 s freeze - out between 3 and 7 fm / c , whereas the freeze - out distribution of protons and pions is centered at about 12 fm / c ( left panel ) . due to the fact that strange hadrons have much smaller scattering cross sections with nucleons and pions , they decouple quite early from the system .",
    "the dominantly soft collisions among the nonstrange hadrons lead to a long tail in the nucleon and pion distributions .",
    "the transverse radius distribution ( right panel ) indicates that the @xmath2 and other hyperons have source sizes similar to the initial source .      in fig .",
    "[ bmpact ] , we show the impact parameter dependence of the total yield of different particle species obtained from the art model for au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev . except for very peripheral collisions ,",
    "a @xmath39 ratio of 0.09 is obtained and found to be independent of collision centrality .",
    "this trend is also observed experimentally from @xmath40 gev up to rhic energies @xcite . within a statistical approach , this implies that @xmath41 and @xmath42 have similar freeze - out volumes .",
    "indeed , in the transport calculation kaons and antikaons exhibit similar mean freeze - out times ( @xmath43 fm / c ) and transverse radii ( @xmath44 fm ) for central collisions .",
    "the @xmath45 exhibits a similar impact parameter dependence because of its associated production with kaons via the reaction @xmath46 . except for the very central collisions the @xmath45 yield in the art model is found to be consistent with the e895 data .    the @xmath0 yield obtained by strangeness - exchange reactions between antikaons and lambda / sigma for different impact parameters",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "[ bmpact ] .",
    "similar to the singly strange hadrons , the @xmath0 yield exhibits nearly a linear dependence on impact parameter .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath0s are mostly produced from secondary collisions in the art model .",
    "[ bmpact ] further shows that while the @xmath45 is enhanced by a factor of 4 , the @xmath0 yield grows steadily by a factor of 6 from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "this specific hierarchy of strangeness enhancement of @xmath47 has been reported for pb+pb collision at the sps by the wa97 collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , at sps energies , the @xmath0 yield tends to saturate for a large number of participants @xmath48 , and its enhancement ( by @xmath49 ) in central collisions is smaller than our prediction for ags energies .",
    "the steady growth of @xmath0 with centrality is a clear indication that its yield is sensitive to the volume of the fireball formed in the collision .",
    "furthermore , we find that the @xmath0 yield from strangeness - exchange reactions in the art model is in reasonable agreement with the e895 data @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to sps energies , where the cascade from the transport model was found @xcite to underpredict somewhat the wa97 data , especially for central collisions",
    ".      it may be interesting to find if strange hadrons also reach chemical equilibrium in heavy ion collisions at @xmath5 gev . to this end",
    "we compare results from the transport model with those from the statistical model based on the grand canonical ensemble @xcite with complete thermal , chemical , and strangeness equilibrium . in this model , the particle density in the boltzmann approximation is given by @xmath50 in the usual notation @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath2 to be also in chemical equilibrium , the cascade to nucleon ratio is @xmath51 ^ 2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for central au+au collisions , we use the art model result for the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "this gives a @xmath0 yield of @xmath53 at a freeze - out temperature of @xmath54 mev .",
    "note that the production of the strange particle @xmath2 is less than 1 per event .",
    "thus , strangeness conservation must be implemented locally , i.e. , a canonical instead of grand canonical ensemble must be used @xcite .",
    "therefore the present estimate of @xmath0 gives only an upper bound .",
    "the higher value for the estimate of @xmath0 from the statistical model compared to that obtained in the present transport approach indicates that @xmath0 does not reach chemical equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , like other strange hadrons , @xmath2 freezes out relatively earlier than nonstrange hadrons with a mean time and transverse radius of 8.4 fm / c and 4.6 fm when the central energy density is about @xmath55 gev/@xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 ratio of 0.026 for @xmath58 fm in the art model is smaller than the equilibrium model estimate of 0.042 but slightly larger than the e895 data @xcite . at midrapidity ,",
    "the @xmath57 ratio of 0.12 has been observed by the e810 collaboration for central si+au collisions at @xmath59 gev @xcite .",
    "since @xmath2 is generated from @xmath60 by strangeness - exchange reactions , its yield would naturally be more peaked at midrapidity than that for @xmath10s .",
    "this is corroborated by a higher @xmath57 ratio of 0.03 at midrapidity @xmath61 .    another way to see if the yield of @xmath2 approaches that for chemical equilibrium is to study how it changes when the cross section is artificially increased for the reaction @xmath62 .",
    "this method was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study whether or not @xmath42 reaches chemical equilibrium at energies available at sis / gsi .",
    "the latter energies are below the threshold for @xmath42 production from nucleon - nucleon collisions in free space .",
    "figure [ bmpact ] shows that the @xmath0 yield increases rather dramatically with increasing cross section @xmath63 .",
    "equally important is the fact that for a given @xmath63 , the enhancement is even more pronounced for central collisions .",
    "nonetheless , it is only for very large cross sections ( @xmath64 ) , where the hydrodynamical limit may have been reached , that the @xmath0 approaches chemical equilibrium with @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly , this value of @xmath0 is even larger than that predicted from the statistical model .",
    "possible reasons for this result are : ( i ) the temperature at complete chemical equilibrium , if reached at all , is much higher than that in the statistical model ; ( ii ) the increased cross section has altered the reaction dynamics especially for @xmath66 and @xmath10 , i.e. , a large abundance of @xmath66s and @xmath45s so produced will increase the @xmath2 at a higher temperature ; or ( iii ) large numbers of @xmath2s , produced at an early and dense stage do not have sufficient time to be annihilated by rescattering because of rapid expansion of the system during its subsequent evolution . the possibility of large @xmath2 production from case ( i ) alone is remote as its yield in the present statistical model is found to be rather insensitive to temperature .      in fig .",
    "[ elab ] , we show the excitation function for the strange particle abundances ( top panel ) in central au+au collisions from the art model . as expected , with increasing beam energy the multiplicities of the hadrons increases .",
    "the enhancement is more pronounced for antikaons and cascades as the energy available for these massive and rare particle production increases .",
    "this is clearly evident in the bottom panel of the fig .",
    "[ elab ] where the @xmath39 ratio is found to increase monotonically with beam energy .",
    "the @xmath0 has the largest rate of increase with energy resulting in an increasing of the ratios @xmath57 and @xmath67 with beam energy .",
    "in summary , we have used a relativistic hadronic transport model to investigate the doubly strange cascade production .",
    "we find that the strangeness - exchange reactions between antikaons and hyperons lead to substantial production of @xmath0 in au+au collisions at @xmath5 gev that is in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "this is in stark contrast to that at sps energies , where the strangeness - exchange reactions underpredict the data for the cascade yield in central collisions .",
    "the success of the purely hadronic scenario eliminates the scope of an exotica that may be necessary to explain the @xmath2 yield at the ags energies . among all the strange hadrons ,",
    "the @xmath2 particle abundances reveal the strongest enhancement with centrality of collision and also with increasing beam energy .",
