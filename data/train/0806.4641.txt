    "ngc 1068 is a prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy . because of its proximity ( @xmath15 ) and brightness",
    ", it has been studied in nearly every possible detail .",
    "the polarimetric observation by @xcite , which reveals a seyfert 1 spectrum in scattered light , suggests that the nucleus and its associated broad - line region ( blr ) are obscured .",
    "this finding provides strong evidence for the unified theory in which viewing angles account for the differences between various active galactic nuclei @xcite    the nuclear region of ngc 1068 harbors a variety of astrophysical phenomena . at the very center of the nucleus",
    "there is a bright compact ( @xmath1603 ) region commonly referred as `` the hot spot '' . within a few arcseconds from the nucleus",
    ", there are several bright and compact clouds that coincide with knots in the radio jets @xcite .",
    "the narrow - line region ( nlr ) is conical in shape toward the northeast ( fig .",
    "1 ) , along a position angle of @xmath17 and with an opening angle of @xmath18 . beyond a 6  radius",
    "the surface brightness drops dramatically , and emission is dominated by two ring - like filaments at @xmath19  and 15  from the nucleus .",
    "high - spatial - resolution spectroscopy of ngc 1068 has been carried out in the optical @xcite as well as in the uv @xcite . from approximately 2  southwest of the nucleus to 4  northeast ,",
    "emission lines exhibit multiple components @xcite : ( 1 ) major emission lines consist of narrow and broad lines ; ( 2 ) broad lines are approximately 2500 - 4000  wide , which may be linked to those that are found in polarized light and believed to be reflected light from the inner blr , and ( 3 ) narrow lines consist of a pair of red and blue components . the [ ] and [ ] line profiles suggest that the separation of these two components varies across the conical nlr .",
    "in addition to an overall biconical ionization configuration , there are compact knots whose optical spectra resemble kinematically the associated absorption line systems in quasars @xcite .",
    "these line - emitting knots have blueshifted radial velocities up to 3000  relative to the galaxy s systemic velocity , contributing mostly to the emission - line flux but not the continuum . between @xmath2025 and 45 northeast from the nucleus ,",
    "uv line emission is redshifted relative to the systemic value , a pattern that is interpreted as the expansion of the plasma in the radio lobe @xcite .",
    "several important emission lines in the far - uv ( fuv ) region between 912 and 1150    are observable only with specially crafted uv instruments . during the astro-1 mission the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) observed ngc 1068 with 18  and 30  apertures .",
    "the most striking features in the wavelengths below 1150    are the strong  @xmath21977 and  @xmath21991 lines",
    ". the line intensity ratios of  i(@xmath211909)/i(@xmath21977 ) and  i(@xmath211750)/i(@xmath21991 ) are temperature sensitive , and the derived temperature is @xmath22 000 k @xcite , higher than the values expected for a region producing and emission by photoionization , the line ratios in ngc 1068   are similar to those of the cygnus loop supernova remnant @xcite , suggesting a significant contribution from shock - heating mechanisms .",
    "astro-2 observations of ngc 1068 were obtained with a 12  aperture at three different positions .",
    "the results @xcite suggest that the emission lines observed with hut likely arise in the inner nuclear region imaged with hst .",
    "however , the poor angular resolution of the hut instrument ( @xmath23 ) does not allow a study of the nlr in terms of spatial details .",
    "the line - emitting mechanisms in the nlr , _",
    "i.e. _ photoionization from the nucleus or shocks produced by jets , have long been under debate . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that emission in the nlr may be entirely caused by shocks .",
    "velocity splitting over 1000 , reported by @xcite , in the vicinity of some of the bright emission - line knots provides evidence that fast shocks exist in the nlr of ngc  1068 . however , seyfert galaxies host powerful nuclear sources of ionizing radiation , and the situation can be more complex with shocks or nuclear photoionization prevailing in different environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that photoionizing shocks are important when a radio jet interacts with the interstellar medium , but not in the objects where sharp , straight - edged ionization cones are observed .",
    "@xcite argued that strong  @xmath21977 and  @xmath21991 emission may arise from fluorescence in photoionized gas if turbulent velocities exceed @xmath201000 .",
    "however , @xcite found that such a velocity would lead to extreme physical conditions that are inconsistent with the astro-2 data .",
    "more recent hst data @xcite found that the emission - line ratios are consistent with photoionization instead of shock heating mechanism .",
    "we have carried out observations with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) to study the spatial distribution of fuv emission lines . in this paper",
    "we present the results of both large - aperture and spatially resolved spectroscopic observations with fuse . for the first time , we are able to study the position dependence of several important diagnostic lines in the fuv band .",
    "fuse covers a wavelength range between 904 and 1188  , with a spectral resolution of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is based on a rowland circle design and consists of four separate optical paths or channels .",
    "each channel consists of a mirror coated with aluminum plus lif or sic , a focal plane assembly , which includes the spectrograph apertures , a diffraction grating coated with aluminum plus lif or sic , and a portion of fuv detector ( two named a and b ) . in all , data are collected from eight traces , and the pairs of a and b are called channels .",
    "our original plan was to take spectra of the nuclear region of ngc 1068  at seven positions separated by @xmath20 1 .",
    "because of thermal instability of the optical structure in orbit , the four channels in the fuse spectrograph are not perfectly aligned , with orbit - dependent drifts possibly as large as 6 . therefore , a new observing strategy was developed to counter the drifting effect .",
    "the high - resolution aperture ( hirs : @xmath8 ) is used for spectroscopy on the finest spatial scales , to ensure that maximum resolution is maintainable even if the telescope imaging or pointing stability degrades below specifications .",
    "since the lif1 channel is mounted on the same optical system as the fuse fine error sensor , the spatial knowledge and stability is fully available for the data from this channel .",
    "the observations of ngc 1068  were carried out with two modes between 2001 november 28 and december 02 .",
    "the first set of data of 21951 seconds was taken with fixed pointing and the lwrs ( low - resolution ) square aperture of 30 .",
    "with such a large aperture , fluxes of the nuclear region are all collected ( fig .",
    "2 ) , even with the thermally - induced mirror motions anticipated .",
    "the second set of observations was carried out in a scanning mode across the conical emission - line region , with a total exposure of 94434 seconds .",
    "a narrow hirs slit at a position angle of @xmath25 was used .",
    "because of orbital constraints , we were not able to place the slit completely perpendicular to the conical axis .",
    "the slit actually makes an angle of @xmath26 with respect to the conical axis .    over years of fuse operation , a large amount of engineering data have been collected , and the drift pattern among the four channels has been well studied .",
    "after peak - up alignments of channels with a bright point source at the beginning of orbital nights , the relative drifts exhibit a dependence on orbital time ( fig .",
    "the lif2 channel exhibits relatively small drifts , within one arcsecond with respect to the lif1 channel .",
    "the sic channels exhibit drifts that can be represented by a constant drift rate during orbital nights .",
    "for example , the sic2 channel drifts relative to the lif1 channel at a rate of approximately 4  per 30 minutes .",
    "the starting drift at the orbital sunset is however variable , depending on the degree of occultation because the drift is generally in the reverse direction during orbital days .",
    "ngc 1068 itself is too diffuse to appear in the guide - star camera . for target acquisition , we used an offset guide star @xmath27  from the nucleus .",
    "we also used a fuv - bright star , feige 23 , which is approximately four degrees away from the source , for instrumental peak - up alignments at the beginning of each pointing .",
    "one orbit of peak - up operation on feige 23 was made to establish the drift pattern due to orbital motion . during the second orbit , one peak - up with the mdrs aperture ( @xmath28 ) and another with hirs",
    "were carried out on feige 23 .",
    "the instrument was then pointed to the southwest part of the nucleus of ngc 1068 , and we started observations in a scanning mode .",
    "as shown in table 1 , each of the five pointings consists of 7 - 9 orbits on the target .",
    "the observation window varied orbit by orbit , between @xmath29 and 2600 sec .",
    "the scanning speed in each individual orbit was set to complete 10  within the designated observation window . after accumulating a total exposure time of @xmath30 sec ,",
    "fuse returned to feige 23 and carried out one peak - up with mdrs and another with hirs , then moved back to ngc 1068  for a new set of scans . after a total of five pointings , fuse returned to feige 23 for one last orbit of peak - up with mdrs , to acquire additional information on the drift pattern .",
    "since the channel alignments are not perfect except at the beginning of the first orbit , the orbit - time dependence of channel drifts derived from the engineering data is only useful in terms of the relative drift speed , not for the absolute timing .",
    "the drifts in the sic channels can be as large as 6 , which is near the size of the ionization cone .",
    "the drift direction is mainly along + x on the fuse aperture plate , i.e. , along the conical direction of ngc 1068 at the desired fuse aperture position angle of @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the observation procedure was designed so that each observation starts @xmath32 from the nucleus in the anti - cone ( southwest ) direction and sweeps across the cone towards the northeast direction at a constant angular velocity .",
    "4 illustrates the time sequence in one orbit of observation : with a constant angular speed , the fuse hirs slit swept across the nuclear region of ngc 1068 .",
    "we identified the peak position of the count rate in the lif1 channel as the nuclear position .",
    "based on the angular speed illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , seven time intervals were defined , and the spectral extraction in these segments yields the data a - g .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "4 marks the segments for the lif1 channel , whose spatial information is fully available . for the other three channels",
    ", their count rates peaked at different times as a result of drifting .",
    "we marked their respective peak positions .",
    "the sweeping speeds in these channels are the sum of two terms : that of the lif1 channel plus the relative drift speed of each channel ( fig .",
    "3 ) with respect to lif1 . their time segments a - g are also illustrated in fig .",
    "the observation results in a series of segments that are dependent on the relative positions with respect to the nucleus . in each time sequence",
    ", one can determine the time when the observation slits coincide with the nucleus , as determined by the peak in the count rate .",
    "the lif1 slit positions are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . seven sets of data are extracted with a relative shift of 1 arcsec ( 125 at the nucleus ) , starting from 2  southwest from the nucleus ( in the opposite direction of the cone ) , to @xmath33 northeast of it .",
    "they were named as a , b , c ( the nucleus , see fig .",
    "1 ) , d , e , f and g. the significant astigmatism of fuse yields a spatial resolution of @xmath32 at best , therefore it can not be used like a normal long - slit spectrograph to dissect the fine details along its slit .",
    "not all the segment data are extracted : if a time segment is incomplete ( `` g '' in fig .",
    "4 , for example ) , they are not used .",
    "four pairs of spectra were derived from the fuse channels .",
    "each pair of `` a '' and `` b '' data is subject to the same normalization factor .",
    "we used the  emission flux , which is common to all four channels , to normalize the spectra to the level in lif1a .",
    "we first calculated the continuum level between 1050 and 1070   for lif2b , sic1a , sic 2b and lif1a , then subtracted it from the spectrum to enable the measurement of emission - line fluxes .",
    "we then calculated the  flux in two bins : a narrow component between 1041.1 and 1043.6  , and a broad component between 1027 and 1048  .",
    "the flux ratios with respect to their values in the lif1a spectrum were calculated , then their mean values were used as the normalization factors ( table 2 ) . for the first set of data , taken with lwrs",
    ", we corrected the `` worm effect '' in the lif1a , b channel , according to the procedures described in the _ fuse instrument and data handbook _",
    "( http://fuse.pha.jhu.edu/analysis/dhbook.html ) .",
    "fuse data reduction was carried out with pipeline version calfuse2.3 , with specific timing flags to extract time - dependent ( hence position - dependent ) segments of spectra in eight traces .",
    "the fuse spatial resolution is 15 , and the spacecraft jitter , as determined from the fuse engineering data , is approximately 06 .",
    "the total spatial resolution is therefore 16 .",
    "since the data were obtained with a 125 slit , there is overlap between positions .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that the sum of the fluxes in all positions is larger than that taken with one large 30  aperture .",
    "the normalized spectra in the four channels are binned to 0.1 , then merged , weighted by their signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the merged spectra at the seven slit positions are plotted in fig .",
    "the wavelength bin between @xmath34 and 1087   falls into a gap between the lif channels , and only data in the sic2b channel exist .",
    "we retrieved archival hst / stis spectroscopic data to complement our fuse data .",
    "two sets of uv spectra are available : one taken at a position angle of @xmath35 and four adjacent slit positions of @xmath36   ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stis - a hereafter ) , and another at a position angle of @xmath37 taken with a slit of @xmath38  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stis - b ) . both sets ( see fig",
    "1 ) contain data taken with grating g140l and g230l , covering a wavelength range of @xmath39 to 3170   at a resolution of @xmath40 .",
    "these stis observations were made between 1988 and 2000 , therefore not simultaneous with the fuse data .",
    "for stis - a , we only used three slit positions as the other does not have g140l data .",
    "the fluxes in the three extracted spectra are summed up .    since",
    "the fuse spatial resolution ( @xmath41 along its slit ) is considerably lower than that of stis , and since the position angles of these two sets of observations are nearly perpendicular , we must normalize the stis data to that of fuse . using the continuum level around 1180",
    "  in these spectra did not result in satisfactory matches as the line / continuum ratios are not constant at these spatial scales across the nucleus .",
    "we therefore use hst wpfc2 images retrieved from mast to determine the normalization factor between stis and fuse data .    to extract the stis spectra",
    ", we first smoothed the 2-d images by 30 pixels ( 067 ) with a gaussian kernel along the spatial direction of the fuse scans , to match the spatial resolution of the corresponding fuse data .",
    "we then ran the standard stis pipeline task `` x1d '' with steps of one arcsecond ( 125 at the nucleus ) that correspond to the respective moving fuse slit positions , and a slit width of 125 . to normalize the stis fluxes",
    ", we used a hst / wfpc2 image of ngc 1068 , taken with filter f218w , and smoothed it along the same direction with the same kernel size as the stis 2-d image .",
    "we then measured the flux in each stis window . to normalize the fuse fluxes , we smoothed the wfpc2 image to the fuse resolution , namely 067 and 5 , respectively , along the direction perpendicular and parallel to that of the fuse slit ( fig .",
    "the flux ratios in respective extraction windows are used to derive the normalization factors ( table 2 ) .",
    "to the northwest direction from the source , there are several bright spots whose fluxes may be picked up because of fuse s low spatial resolution along its slit .",
    "we tested with several extraction windows that are sufficiently short not to include the fluxes from these bright spots in the smoothed wfpc2 image .",
    "since it is unlikely that these bright spots contribute to the redshifted uv emission lines , we used the flux values measured in a short window in calculating the scaling factor .",
    "any uncertainties introduced by this window selection only affect the scaling of ly@xmath14  and  in position a and g.    since the fuse slit positions are accurate to @xmath20 03 , we measured the fluxes in the neighboring regions , to make sure that the normalization factors are accurate to at least 20% .",
    "the height of stis extraction windows is the same as that of fuse ( @xmath9 ) , but their widths ( 01 - 02 ) are much smaller than fuse ( 20 )",
    ". therefore considerable stis normalization factors were applied .",
    "the matching stis spectra are plotted in fig .",
    "we compared extracted spectra from the stis - a and stis - b datasets , and their line ratios are comparable within 25% . in the following section , we only use the data from stis - a , as they cover a spatial region six times as wide ( @xmath42 ) as that of stis - b .",
    "spectral analyses were carried out using iraf task _ specfit _ @xcite . for the fuse spectrum taken with a large aperture , we used a pair of narrow components and one broad component in the  emission line profile .",
    "each narrow  component was modeled as a doublet whose wavelength ratio is fixed by atomic data and whose line widths are identical .",
    "the  emission feature is heavily absorbed by interstellar absorption at @xmath20 1037 , therefore we introduced several absorption components .",
    "the ly@xmath43emission is not prominent , and it is often overwhelmed by the broad  emission . only in one or two positions is the ly@xmath43  emission visible .",
    "we therefore only modeled one component with a fixed line width . for  and",
    "emission line features , one narrow component and one broad component were included in fitting .",
    "we fitted a power law with no extinction to the continuum .",
    "the fitted results are listed in table 3 .    for the fuse spectra taken at positions a - g",
    ", we used one narrow component plus one broad component to model the  emission , and one component for the  and   lines . to reduce the effect of channel drifts",
    ", the fuse spectra were fitted individually for each channel .",
    "the fitting results in table 4 are primarily derived from the lif1 data , which are not affected by channel drifts . for wavelengths below 995 ",
    ", we used the fitting results from the scaled sic2a channel , which extends to 1005   and is therefore less susceptible than the sic1b channel to the detector edge effects . for 1085",
    ", lif2a data were used .",
    "the fluxes of fitted components were normalized by the values in table 2 , and then tabulated in table 4 .",
    "the profiles of four major emission lines at seven different slit positions are plotted in fig .",
    "7 , to show the changes in the narrow and broad components as a function of spatial location .",
    "the uv spectra suggest a low extinction level .",
    "we first fitted the continuum in the wavelength windows that are free of emission and absorption lines , and the results suggest a power - law index of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and an extinction of @xmath46 . as a comparison ,",
    "the hut spectrum between 912 and 1800   was fitted with a power - law continuum of @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "if we adopt this extinction value , the power - law index is @xmath49 .",
    "the similar power indices suggest that one single power - law continuum can fit the far - uv spectrum of ngc 1068 without introducing significant reddening , as suggested from the uv / optical line ratios @xcite .",
    "many previous studies have gradually unraveled the kinematical complexities of gas in the nuclear region of ngc 1068 .",
    "the x - ray data @xcite suggest that emission lines are formed mainly in a photoionied plasma of a temperature around a few ev . the spatial resolution afforded by hst leads to a picture of decelerating jet @xcite :",
    "a biconical outflow from the nuclear region sweeps up denser , ambient clouds in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of ngc 1068 .",
    "other possibilities include overlapping , discrete ejection that gradually dissipates @xcite .",
    "in addition , a high - velocity radio jet impinges on some of the clouds .",
    "some gas expands perpendicularly to the axis of the jet , and the expanding radio lobe at the end of the jet also pushes on the ambient ism . near the nucleus",
    ", kinematic components span several thousand kilometers per second in velocity , and the continuum hot spot visible in hst images reflects a polarized view of the broad lines in the active nucleus .    our spatially resolved fuse observations , while not at the resolution of hst , add information from major emission lines shortward of the hst bandpass at high spectral resolution .",
    "we plot the fluxes of major uv emission lines from our observations at seven slit positions in fig .",
    "8 , and list the fitted line properties in table 4 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the four emission lines in the fuse spectral range , along with a comparison to emission lines observed in the stis spectra .",
    "the most prominent feature in the fuse spectra is the  @xmath21@xmath211031,1037 emission line . in the data taken with lwrs , the two narrow   components are of fwhm @xmath50  and a separation of @xmath10 . in the seven spectra taken with a narrow slit ,",
    "we resolve this blend into one narrow component with fwhm of @xmath50  and one broad component . in fig .",
    "9 we plot the  profiles at the seven different slit positions .",
    "the high spectral resolution of fuse data enables us to compare with the results of optical fabry - perot spectroscopy @xcite , which reveal a narrow core of @xmath51 . according to the optical data ,",
    "nearly 75% of the [ ] @xmath216583 flux is from components of @xmath52  wide .",
    "line widths at such a scale are consistent with that derived from hst uv spectroscopy .",
    "the narrow - line flux in the fuse spectra is highly concentrated ( 60% ) at the compact core , suggesting that the `` true '' nlr probably remains unresolved , at a sub - arcsecond scale .",
    "while the narrow o vi emission line is not the dominant component , its distribution is different from its broad counterpart , while only 40% of the broad  line flux is from slit position c.    it is surprising that the  emission is dominated by a component that is broader than those seen in polarized light : in the lwrs spectrum , more than 3/4 of the flux is from a component with fwhm @xmath0  that is blue - shifted relative to the narrow component by @xmath53 .",
    "this broad component is present in all seven fuse slit spectra with considerable strength .",
    "it may arise from the reflected emission from the hidden blr , and/or may be the result of a significant velocity dispersion in the nlr .",
    "the hst foc data @xcite reveal that emission lines near the hot knots 2  northeast ( fuse slit positions d and e ) are split into two velocity systems separated by @xmath52 .",
    "the stis spectra discussed by @xcite show [ ] emission knots spanning such a broad velocity range in the immediate vicinity of the nucleus , but not at distances of several arcseconds .",
    "since the fuse slit collects emission from a block of regions spanning several arcseconds perpendicular to the conical axis , the total line emission from these regions may be blended into one broad component .    the ratios of /  may provide insight into the physical conditions of the line - emitting regions .",
    "the value is higher for the narrow components than their broad counterparts , implying a range of the ionization parameter @xmath54 in a typical photionization calculation .",
    "high values of @xmath55 are consistent with models that assume the same origin for the associated absorbers and blr @xcite , suggesting that the clouds that produce the broad emission components may be of the same origin as associated absorbers .",
    "the narrow  line exhibits a systematic velocity shift from position a to g by approximately 220 .",
    "this gradient in the spatially resolved spectra explains why there are two narrow - line components in the integrated flux from the large - aperture fuse spectrum , where it is unresolved .",
    "@xcite reported a similar velocity pattern in their hst spectra .",
    "@xcite successfully modeled this as a biconical outflow in which radial velocity changes as a function of the distance to the central nucleus : the emission line knots show evidence for radial acceleration to a projected distance of 2  to the northeast direction , followed by deceleration up to 4",
    ". the  line widths also increase at @xmath56  from the nucleus , probably implying a larger dispersion in these regions .",
    "the broad component of  exhibits a qualitatively similar kinematic pattern , but at a larger amplitude : its centroid shifts by @xmath52   ( fig .",
    "10 ) across the same spatial region .",
    "11 shows similar trends for the narrow and broad components of   in the hst spectra which have not been explicitly noted in previous studies : the narrow component follows the kinematic pattern of the optical lines modeled by @xcite ; the broad component of shows behavior similar to that of  in the fuse spectra .",
    "prior observations that noted this blue - shifted broad component invariably attributed it to the reflection of the blr . the blue shift and width ( at the position of the hot spot , and in integrated light ) are comparable to the broad polarized h@xmath43 line observed by @xcite .    in a scattered blr picture ,",
    "a blue shift is caused by the outflowing wind from the torus along our line of sight , and a line width is due to the intrinsic broad line width convolved with the thermal width of the hot reflecting wind . as",
    "a broad component is present in the fuse spectra at all seven positions , it is possible to assume that this is reflected light from the hidden blr .",
    "however , a large covering factor is needed to explain the observed fluxes . assuming a covering factor of 0.1",
    ", the intrinsic flux of the broad  emission in ngc 1068 would exceed that in ngc 4151 .",
    "a more reasonable explanation for the observed broad line widths is the large velocity dispersion between bright knots . at approximately 2  from the core ( position a and e )",
    ", the fwhms of broad components are the broadest at 3200 .",
    "these maxima coincide with the widest spliting of velocity in bright knots @xcite . with an intrinsic dispersion of @xmath20800  and a separation in velocity of @xmath202500  between bright knots ( from stis results ) , data collected by",
    "the long fuse slit would exhibit a broad component of @xmath203200 , which is what observed at positions a and e. extended regions of hot , photoionized gas are seen in x - ray images of ngc 1068 @xcite that could be visible manifestations of this hot outflow .",
    "it is natural to assume that these high - velocity clouds may be related to the associated absorbers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) in agn , which are mostly blueshifted .",
    "as with the lower - velocity , lower ionization emission - line gas , the acceleration of this high ionization gas eventually is brought to a halt by an unknown deceleration mechanism , which might plausibly be interaction with the ambient ism of ngc 1068 .",
    "the evidence for deceleration at arcsecond scale may suggest that acceleration of the outflow materials may take place at sub - arcsecond scales .",
    "the flux ratio of  @xmath211909 to 977 is extremely sensitive to temperature , and the value measured in n1068 suggests a high temperature that is consistent with shock - heating @xcite .",
    "the fuse data taken with a large aperture ( table 3 ) reveal that this emission line consists of a narrow and a broad component .",
    "the broad component is weak and hence can not be well separated in the data segments taken with a narrow fuse slit .",
    "the stis data reveal that  @xmath211909 emission can be fitted with a narrow and a broad component of fwhm @xmath57 and 3500 , respectively . in principal",
    ", the ratio of   @xmath211909 to 977 should be calculated only between the narrow components .    as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the flux of  @xmath21977 is highly concentrated in position c and d. high temperatures implied by this line emission may therefore be associated with the compact core . in a large portion of the ionization cone ,",
    "the line ratios ( @xmath211909/@xmath21977 ) are considerably higher , suggesting a lower temperature . however , the line ratios are considerably lower than that derived from the hut data , where broad   @xmath211909 component was included in the calculation .",
    "the line ratio of  @xmath211750 to @xmath21991 is also temperature dependent , and its value has also been used to derive a high temperature in the ionization cone .",
    "the fuse data also reveal a pair of components in the data taken with a large aperture .",
    "unlike  @xmath21977 , the broad component of  @xmath21991 , as shown in table 3 , is stronger than its narrow counterpart .",
    "the fuse data taken with a narrow slit shows that nearly a half of this broad component is in position c. in other positions , the  @xmath21991 emission can only be fitted with one component of fwhm @xmath6 . in combination with the trend for  @xmath21977 , we conclude that a bulk of flux in these temperature - sensitive emission lines is from the compact core of ngc 1068 , and their intensity is not directly tied to the physical conditions in the ionization cone .",
    "the distribution of  @xmath211085 is different from other emission lines in the fuse spectra : as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the  flux varies smoothly across the nlr region , like that of ly@xmath14 ,  and other lines in the stis spectra .",
    "since  emission is believed to be produced mainly by recombination and is insensitive to the gas temperature , this pattern of variation may simply reflect the distribution of nlr gas across the ionization cone .",
    "the ratio of  emission @xmath211640 to @xmath211085 is believed to be a reddening indicator . as shown in fig .",
    "12 , the ratio is nearly constant ( @xmath58 ) between slit positions b and f. this is consistent with the hut result of @xmath59 , suggesting an insignificant level of extinction ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the low values at positions a and g may suggest that the data at these positions are not reliable .",
    "the  i(1640)/i(1085 ) ratio is slightly lower than that expected from recombination , and this may suggest that the  @xmath211085 may be slightly contaminated by other weak uv emission lines .",
    "@xmath211085 is a likely candidate , and the trend of decreasing  ( 1640)/i(1085 ) ratio with distance from the nucleus supports this as there is a noticeable decrease in ionization state at larger distances from the nucleus @xcite . as with  and , there appears to be a broad component that is considerably blueshifted .",
    "however , the relevant wavelength range is in a gap between the lif channels , and only sic2b data are available . because of",
    "the low s / n ratio , the reality of such a broad component is still questionable , as no such counterpart is found in the corresponding hst spectra of @xmath211640 .",
    "we have carried out high - spectral resolution , spatially resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear region of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 .",
    "the high spectral resolution of fuse data enables us to study the line profiles of , , and as a function of position across the nuclear region .",
    "our observations using a long slit of @xmath8 at steps of @xmath61 along the axis of the emission - line cone resulted in a set of seven spatially resolved spectra running from @xmath11 southwest of the nucleus to @xmath12 northeast .    the profiles exhibit considerable structure : a prominent broad component with fwhm @xmath0 @xmath1 , and a narrow component of @xmath51 @xmath62 .",
    "both components show a position - dependent velocity gradient along the conical axis with a velocity shift of @xmath63 @xmath1 in the narrow component and a shift of @xmath52 @xmath1 in the broad component .",
    "both patterns are consistent with radial outflow from the nuclear region .",
    "both the continuum and emission lines suggest low extinction : the uv continuum is flat to the shortest wavelengths in the fuse spectrum , and the best fit is a power law with virtually no reddening .",
    "the 1640/1085 ratio also is reflective of a consistently low extinction factor across the emission - line cone .",
    "the majority of the and emission arises in the compact core , suggesting that the region with extremely high temperature is very close to the nucleus and remains unresolved .",
    "the line emission at @xmath11 northeast of the nucleus is strong and broad , characterized by ( a ) a strong lya flux , but normal flux ; ( b ) a broad line ; and ( c ) a significantly enhanced flux , possibly the result of hot knots associated with shock heating .",
    "this work has been supported in part by nasa grant nag-8 - 1527 and nag-8 - 1133 .",
    "the fuse and hst data presented in this paper were obtained from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) .",
