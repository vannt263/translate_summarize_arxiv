    "the effect of quenched random impurities which couple to the local energy density on the critical behaviour of a system whose pure version undergoes a continuous transition is well understood in terms of the harris criterion @xcite : if the specific heat exponent @xmath2 of the pure system is negative , such impurities do not change the qualitative nature of the transition or its universality class , while in the opposite case there is expected to be different behaviour described by a new random fixed point of the renormalisation group ( rg ) . given the volume of literature devoted to this subject",
    ", it is rather surprising to find relatively few studies of the effects of such impurities on systems whose pure versions undergo a first - order transition , despite the ubiquity of such systems in nature .",
    "a naive extension of the harris criterion , based on the observation that the effective value of @xmath2 is unity at a first - order transition , might suggest that randomness is always strongly relevant . on the other hand ,",
    "first - order behaviour is accompanied by a finite correlation length and is commonly assumed to be stable under small perturbations . following early work by imry and wortis @xcite ,",
    "aizenman and wehr @xcite and hui and berker @xcite showed that the role of dimensionality @xmath3 is crucial .",
    "in fact the first authors proved a rigorous theorem which states that for @xmath4 the gibbs state is always unique , for arbitrarily small but non - zero concentration of impurities .",
    "this means that there can be no phase coexistence at the transition and hence no latent heat .",
    "this result raises a number of important questions : ( a ) what is its physical mechanism ; ( b ) is the continuous transition accompanied by a divergent correlation length ; ( c ) if so , what are the ( presumably ) universal critical exponents characterising the transition ; and ( d ) what happens for @xmath5 ? initial monte carlo studies of ( c ) @xcite suggested that the critical behaviour of all such systems might be strongly universal , exhibiting ising - like exponents independent of the underlying symmetry of the model .",
    "this received some theoretical support @xcite .",
    "however , more recent numerical studies ( to be described below ) support earlier theoretical results @xcite in suggesting that the critical behaviour of , for example , the random bond @xmath0-state potts model depends continuously on @xmath0 , both in the region where the pure model has a continuous transition , and where it is first - order . the aim of this talk is to summarise some of these recent developments , and to provide at least partial answers to the above questions .",
    "first , i want to describe a mapping @xcite of this problem to the _ random field _ ising model ( rfim ) , which is asymptotically valid for very strong first - order transitions , and which provides a physical explanation of the aizenman - wehr result @xcite , as well as a prediction for what happens when @xmath5 . _ _    consider a pure system at a thermal first - order transition point .",
    "there will be coexistence between a ( generally unique ) disordered phase and the ( generally non - unique ) ordered phases .",
    "the internal energies @xmath6 and @xmath7 of these two kinds of phase will differ by the latent heat , @xmath8 .",
    "now consider a interface between the disordered phase and one of the ordered phases , with surface tension @xmath9 ( measured in units of @xmath10 ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is large , there will be very few isolated bubbles of the opposite phase above or below the main interface .",
    "its equilibrium statistics may therefore be described by a free energy functional equal to its area multiplied by @xmath9 .",
    "let us compare this with the interface between the two _ ordered _ phases of an ising model , with spins taking the values @xmath11 , at low temperatures . once again , there will be few bubbles of the opposite phase , and the bare interfacial tension will be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the reduced exchange coupling . in the limit when @xmath14 is large , these interfacial models are therefore identical _ _    now consider the effects of randomness in these two models , in the first case random bonds , coupling to the local energy density , and in the second random fields , coupling to the local magnetisation . in the rfim , these are accounted for by adding a term @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the local random field , and in the two terms @xmath17 is summed respectively above and below the instantaneous position of the interface . for random impurities of local concentration @xmath18 we have , similarly , @xmath19 . apart from a constant independent of the position of the interface ,",
    "this may be written as @xmath8 times @xmath20 , exactly the same form as for the rfim .",
    "we may therefore set up a dictionary between these two cases , in which the thermal variables of the random bond system are related to the magnetic variables of the rfim : @xmath21 where the last relation is between the fields @xmath22 and a _ uniform _ magnetic field @xmath23 which respectively distinguish between the two phases .",
    "although the above mapping may seem ill - defined in its use of the local energy density as a kind of order parameter , it may be made completely explicit , for example , for the @xmath0-state potts model through the mapping to the random cluster model , where @xmath24 for large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "_ _    the interfacial model of the rfim has been studied extensively @xcite and , in particular , rg equations have been derived which are asymptotically exact in the limit of low temperatures and weak randomness , just where our mapping is valid . for @xmath25",
    "the variable @xmath26 is ( marginally ) relevant , and , just as this destroys the spontaneous magnetisation for the rfim , the latent heat vanishes for the random bond case , in accord with the aizenman - wehr theorem @xcite . for the rfim , the rg trajectories flow towards a paramagnetic fixed point at which the correlation length @xmath27 is finite , but note that this is outside the region where the mapping to the random bond problem is valid .",
    "we can not conclude , therefore , anything about the nature of the latter s true critical behaviour from this argument .",
    "in fact , numerical and other analytic studies indicate that the actual correlation length is divergent , and hence @xmath28 is merely a crossover length in this case .",
    "the predictions are more interesting for @xmath5 , when the rfim exhibits a critical fixed point at @xmath29 and a finite value of @xmath30 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there is now a region in which the spontaneous magnetisation ( latent heat ) is non - vanishing as the sign of the uniform field ( @xmath31 ) is changed .",
    "this region is bounded , in the case of the rfim by the critical curve , close to which the critical behaviour is determined by the zero - temperature fixed point .",
    "similarly , the first - order region of the random bond system will be bounded by a line of _ tricritical _ points , above which ( presumably ) the transition becomes continuous .",
    "since the fixed point occurs in the region where the mapping between the two systems is valid , we may infer some of the tricritical exponents from those of the rfim @xcite .",
    "for example , the latent heat should vanish as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the usual magnetisation exponent of the rfim .",
    "similarly , the correlation length on the critical surface should diverge as @xmath34 with the usual exponent @xmath35 of the rfim .",
    "but the behaviour for @xmath36 is related to the _ magnetic _ properties of the rfim , and is complicated by the fact that the temperature at the rfim fixed point is dangerously irrelevant , with an rg eigenvalue @xmath37 which is responsible for the violation of hyperscaling @xmath38 in that model . as a result , for example , the correlation length in the random bond model at @xmath39 diverges as @xmath40 , with @xmath41 . _ _ _ _",
    "as is well - known , the pure @xmath0-state potts model undergoes a first - order transition for @xmath42 in @xmath25 , and it is a relatively simple system to study numerically in the random bond case . by choosing a suitable distribution of randomness , one can fix the model to be self - dual so that the critical point is determined exactly .",
    "one method , which is very effective for pure two - dimensional critical system , is to study the finite - size scaling behaviour of the eigenvalues @xmath43 of the transfer matrix in a strip of width @xmath44 . by conformal invariance @xcite ,",
    "these are related to the scaling dimensions @xmath45 by @xmath46 as @xmath47 . for the potts model ,",
    "it is possible @xcite to write the transfer matrix in the so - called connectivity basis @xcite , allowing @xmath0 to appear as an easily tunable variable . in the random case",
    ", however , the transfer matrices for different rows do not commute , and the role of the @xmath43 is taken by the lyapunov exponents which govern the average growth rate of the norm of vectors under the action of the transfer matrices .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation functions is related to these exponents as for the pure case . in order to use conformal invariance ,",
    "it is necessary to assume translational invariance which is only recovered after quenched averaging .",
    "however , the lyapunov exponents themselves are not self - averaging , only their logarithms .",
    "this is related to the phenomenon of multi - scaling , whereby the average of the @xmath48th power of the correlation function is governed by an exponent @xmath49 which is not linear in @xmath48 .",
    "since this occurs in most random systems , however , i shall not treat the problem in detail here .",
    "it still proves possible , effectively by measuring the whole distribution of the @xmath50 , to extract the decay of the average correlation function , and hence , for example , the magnetic exponent @xmath51 .",
    "the results from our study @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "we see that the value of @xmath52 appears to increase    steadily with @xmath0 . for @xmath53",
    "it agrees with the analytic @xmath54-expansion @xcite .",
    "there appears to be no break at @xmath55 where the pure transition becomes first - order .",
    "our results disagree with earlier monte carlo work @xcite for @xmath56 where a number close to the ising value of @xmath57 was reported .",
    "however , more recent monte carlo results by picco @xcite find @xmath58 for @xmath56 ( and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , while chatelain and berche @xcite report @xmath61 for @xmath56 .",
    "the small discrepancy with our results may be explained by a careful study of the crossover behaviour which shows that stronger randomness ( beyond the reach of our methods ) must be considered as @xmath0 increases @xcite .",
    "all studies report a thermal exponent @xmath62 .",
    "this approximately saturates the lower bound proved by chayes et al @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that , in general , this might be a result of the averaging procedure and that in some random systems the ` true ' value of @xmath35 might be less than unity .",
    "however , it can shown that this is not the case here .",
    "although the @xmath0-state potts model is relatively simple to analyse numerically , like most other first - order transitions it is difficult to study in any kind of perturbative rg approach , since the randomness is strongly relevant .",
    "however , this is not always the case for systems which exhibit weak ` fluctuation - driven ' first - order transitions .",
    "an example is afforded by @xmath44 ising models with spins @xmath63 , coupled through their energy densities , with a hamiltonian @xmath64 for uniform couplings @xmath13 , this exhibits a first - order transition when @xmath65 , and in fact , on the critical surface is equivalent to the gross - neveu model , which may be analysed nonperturbatively to show that the correlation length is @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "even with random bonds @xmath67 of strength @xmath68 the one - loop rg equations may be derived by very simple combinatorial methods @xcite , to give @xcite @xmath69 these flows are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    when @xmath70 , @xmath71 runs away to infinity , in a manner consistent with the non - perturbative result for @xmath28 .",
    "when randomness is added , however , it is marginally relevant , and in fact the flows are quite similar to those found for the rfim quoted earlier if we identify the interfacial tension @xmath72 .",
    "however , in this case , we also see where the flows end : in this case at the critical fixed point corresponding to @xmath44 decoupled pure ising models .",
    "( this is the only example i know of where the infrared and ultraviolet fixed points of a set of rg flows are the same . )",
    "there have been various generalisations of this calculation to coupled potts models @xcite . in most cases",
    "the addition of randomness induces flow towards a critical fixed point which is perturbatively accessible . in higher dimensions , however , different outcomes are possible .",
    "adding randomness to models in @xmath73 dimensions with cubic anisotropy appears not to change their fluctuation - driven first - order character @xcite .",
    "however , for impure @xmath74-component superconductors in @xmath73 dimensions there is a critical concentration above which the transition becomes continuous @xcite .",
    "there are still many open questions in this relatively little explored area .",
    "a lot more needs to be learned about the nature of the universal critical behaviour ( if indeed it is universal ) , both in @xmath25 and for @xmath5 when the randomness is sufficiently strong . in the former case , it may be possible to solve the problem by conformal field theory methods .",
    "even the limit of large @xmath0 appears non - trivial , however .",
    "similar ideas apply to quantum phase transitions and may have relevance for the quantum hall effect .",
    "most importantly , it should be possible to find experimental systems which realise some of the predictions discussed above .",
    "there are , after all , many three - dimensional examples of first - order transitions .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the randomness should couple only to the local energy density , not to the order parameter , otherwise this becomes the random field problem .",
    "it is also important to ensure that the tricritical behaviour is driven by the effects discussed and not by some simple mean - field mechanism ( which would give rise to mean - field tricritical exponents in @xmath75 , part from logs . )",
    "finally it is important to understand the dynamics of these systems : it may be that , like the random field problem , they are plagued by logarithmically slow time scales close to the critical point @xcite .",
