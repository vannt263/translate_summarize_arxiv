    "the generalized alternating projection ( gap ) algorithm , originally proposed in  @xcite , has demonstrated excellent performance on diversely compressive sensing ( cs ) problems , including two dimensional ( 2d ) images  @xcite , hyperspectral images  @xcite , videos  @xcite , depth images  @xcite , and polarization images  @xcite .",
    "however , all the above demonstrations , including the real system applications , utilize gap to solve the compressive sensing problem in the transformation domain , _",
    "i.e. _ , the wavelet or dct ( discrete cosine transformation ) domain .",
    "specifically , gap is used to solved the following problem : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the transformation matrix , which is a kronecker product of different bases if the transformation is performed on each dimension .",
    "@xmath2 is the measurement , and @xmath3 is the sensing matrix .",
    "@xmath4 is the desired signal and @xmath5 denotes the corresponding coefficients in the transformed domain .",
    "@xmath6 signifies the weighted group @xmath7 norm  @xcite defined as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 denoting the @xmath10 norm and @xmath11 a sub - vector of @xmath5 containing components indexed by @xmath12 with @xmath13 denoting the weight for this group .",
    "though great success has been obtained , it is not always easy to find a good transformation @xmath1 to be imposed on the data .",
    "furthermore , this transformation will take some computational time and the selection of groups and weights affects the results significantly  @xcite .    on the other hand , the total variation ( tv )",
    "based algorithms have demonstrated high performance on variously cs problems  @xcite .",
    "it solves the following problem : @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the tv norm .",
    "the question is can we solve the tv minimization problem in ( [ eq : tv ] ) by gap ?",
    "this paper will fill the research gap by developing a new algorithm using gap to solve ( [ eq : tv ] ) .",
    "in the following , we use @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the differential operation and it will be performed on different dimensions if @xmath4 denotes an image or video .    under the gap formulation , the problem in can be rewritten as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radius of the @xmath20-ball based on the tv of the signal .    we solve as a series of alternating projection problem : @xmath21 which is equivalent to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a regulizer and @xmath24 denotes the iteration number .",
    "equation   can be solved by alternating updating @xmath25 and @xmath4 . given @xmath25 , the update of @xmath4 is simply an euclidean projection of @xmath25 on the linear manifold ; this is solved by @xmath26 where we assume @xmath27 is invertible and in a lot of cs applications  @xcite , @xmath27 is a diagonal matrix and it is very easy to calculate the inversion .    given @xmath25 , the update of @xmath4 is an tv denoising problem which can be solved by the iterative clipping algorithm  @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the clipping function @xmath31 is defined as : @xmath32 the iteration starts from @xmath29 , then @xmath25 , and finally update @xmath4 .      according to  @xcite",
    ", the linear manifold can also be adaptively adjusted and so can be modified as @xmath33 with @xmath34      the alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) algorithm  @xcite provides an alternative solution to a lot of optimization problems . though both admm and gap introduce an auxiliary variable , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 in ( [ eq : tvregu ] ) to solve the problem , the difference lies in how to update @xmath4 . under the admm formulation , introducing another regulizer @xmath35 , the cost function will be : @xmath36 admm cyclically solves the following subproblems : @xmath37 given @xmath25 , ( [ eq : admm_x_t+1 ] ) is a quadratic optimization problem of @xmath4 and can be simplified to : @xmath38 which admits the following closed - form solution : @xmath39 since in the cs framework , @xmath3 is a fat matrix , @xmath40 will be a large matrix and thus the matrix inversion formula can be used to simplify the problem : @xmath41\\nonumber\\\\      & \\times[{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}^{\\top}{\\boldsymbol{y}}+ \\eta { \\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{(t ) } ] .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with some special constraints on the sensing matrix @xmath3 , ( [ eq : admm_xv_inv ] ) can be simplified as follows : a ) for the 2d image cs considered in this paper , the sensing matrix is the permuted hadamard matrix , which has been implemented in the lensless camera  @xcite . in this case @xmath42 , therefore , @xmath43 which is same as ( [ eq : gap_xt ] ) if @xmath44 . however , in the experiments , we observed that tuning this @xmath35 is critical to the performance of the algorithm .",
    "\\b ) for the video  @xcite and hyperspectral image  @xcite cs considered in this paper , the sensing matrix is a shifting binary mask and @xmath27 is a diagonal matrix : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of rows in @xmath3 and for the video and hyperspectral image cs , it is the pixel number in each frame ( or the measurement ) . following this , in ( [ eq : admm_xv_inv ] ) : @xmath47 is also a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements : @xmath48 and @xmath49    in this case , @xmath50 can be update by : @xmath51 with @xmath52 following this , @xmath53 where @xmath54 can be calculated element - wise via : @xmath55_m}{\\eta + r_m } ,          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56_m$ ] denoting the @xmath57-th element of the vector inside @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "again , the update for @xmath4 will be the same as gap if @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 can be calculated very efficiently .",
    "given @xmath4 , ( [ eq : admm_theta_t+1 ] ) is a tv denoising problem and can be solved by the iterative clipping algorithm in ( [ eq : thetavt])-([eq : zvt ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the difference of gap and admm lies in the updating equation of @xmath4 , where the euclidean projection is used in gap while admm introduces a new regulizer @xmath35 .",
    "we have observed this @xmath35 affects the results critically in the experiments . one important property of gap compared with other algorithms , _",
    "e.g. _ , admm , twist  @xcite , tval3  @xcite , _ et .",
    "_ , is that no parameter is required to tune to update this @xmath4 , since it is only an euclidean projection .",
    "we test the compressive sensing inversion using gap - tv on diverse 2d images used in  @xcite , with the compressive sensing matrix defined by the permuted hadamard matrix as used in the real lensless camera  @xcite .",
    "all the images are resized to @xmath60 and the csr is defined as : @xmath61 where the number of columns in @xmath3 is equivalent to the entire pixel number of the image .",
    "we not only test the high csr case , _",
    "i.e. _ , csr @xmath62 $ ] , but also test the extremely low csr case , _",
    "i.e. _ , csr @xmath63 $ ] , which may be of interest to the real applications that are used to detect unusual events  @xcite without caring too much of the image quality .",
    "results are summarized in table  [ table : sim_psnr ] , where ` acc - gap - tv ' denotes the accelerated gap - tv and gap - w signifies the gap with wavelet transformation  @xcite .",
    "[ table : sim_psnr ]      next , we verify the proposed gap - tv algorithm for the video compressive sensing with the regime followed by the coded aperture compressive temporal imaging ( cacti )  @xcite . the gap algorithm has been employed under this framework using wavelet and dct transformation and has been demonstrated excellent performance for both grayscale and color video  @xcite compressive sensing . by imposing the tree structure weights corresponding to the wavelet",
    ", gap has demonstrated improved performance  @xcite compared with the original version proposed in  @xcite .",
    "however , it is very tricky to select the groups and group weights in the transform domain .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we utilize the gap - tv algorithm , which is almost parameter - free , for the video cs as used in cacti .",
    "the sensing process of cacti can be formulated as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath66-th frame corresponding to @xmath57-th measurement , @xmath67 ; @xmath68 is the shifting binary mask used to encode @xmath66-th frame ; each @xmath69 is a shifted version of others .",
    "@xmath70 denotes the hadamard ( element - wise ) product .",
    "simulation results of gap - tv compared with other algorithms are shown in figure  [ fig : traffic_cacti ] .",
    "for the hyperspectral image cs , we follow the architecture in the coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging ( cassi )  @xcite , where the formulation is similar to cacti discussed in section  [ sec : video_cs ] .",
    "each frame at different bandwidth is modulated by a shifting version of the physical mask .",
    "we conduct the simulation on the  bird \" data as used in  @xcite with results shown in figure  [ fig : bird_psnr_sim ] .",
