    "given @xmath2 , the riesz @xmath3energy of a set on points @xmath4 on a subset @xmath5 is @xmath6 this energy has a physical interpretation for some particular values of @xmath3 , i.e. for @xmath7 the riesz energy is the coulomb potential and for @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the newtonian potential .",
    "in the special case @xmath10 the energy is defined by @xmath11 and is related to the transfinite diameter and the capacity of the set by classical potential theory , see for example @xcite .",
    "the minimal value of this energy and its asymptotic behavior have been extensively studied , most remarkably in the case that @xmath12 is the @xmath13dimensional unit sphere . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that for @xmath14 and @xmath15 there exist constants @xmath16 ( depending only on @xmath13 and @xmath3 ) such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the continuous s - energy for the normalized lebesgue measure , @xmath19 finding the precise value of the constants in is an important open problem and has been addressed by several authors , see @xcite for some very precise conjectures and @xcite or @xcite for surveys .",
    "one can post the problem as follows    for @xmath20 , let @xmath21 be defined by @xmath22 find asymptotic values for @xmath21 as @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , prove if the limit exists .",
    "a sometimes successful strategy for the upper bound in the constant @xmath21 is to take collections of random points in @xmath24 and then compute the expected value of the energy ( which is of course greater than or equal to the minimum possible value ) .",
    "simply taking @xmath25 points with the uniform distribution in @xmath24 already gives the correct term @xmath26 , and other distributions with nice separation properties have proved successful in bounding the constant @xmath21 .",
    "we are thus interested in computationally feasible random procedures to generate points in sets which exhibit local repulsion .",
    "one natural choice is using _ determinantal point processes _ which have these two properties ( see @xcite for theoretical properties and @xcite for an implementation ) .",
    "a brief summary of the fundamental properties of determinantal point processes is given in section [ sec : dpp ] .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite a determinantal point process named the _ spherical ensemble _ is used to produce low  energy random configurations on @xmath27 .",
    "this process was previously studied by krishnapur @xcite who proved a remarkable fact : the spherical ensemble is equivalent to taking eigenvalues of @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 have gaussian entries ) and sending them to the sphere through the stereographic projection .    in @xcite",
    "a different determinantal point process rooted on the use of spherical harmonics is described , producing low  energy random configurations in @xmath24 for some infinite sequence of values of @xmath25 . in particular , it is proved in that paper that @xmath30 if @xmath31 , @xmath32 can be changed to @xmath33 in ( see ( * ? ? ? * cor .",
    "the bound in is the best known to the date for general @xmath13 ( although more precise bounds exist for particular values of @xmath13 including @xmath34 , see @xcite ) . in particular , for @xmath35 and odd dimensions the formula in reads @xmath36    the determinantal point process in @xcite is called the _ harmonic ensemble _ and it is shown to be the optimal one ( at least for @xmath35 ) among a certain class of determinantal point processes obtained from subspaces of functions with real values defined in @xmath24 .",
    "however , the bound in @xcite for the case @xmath37 is worse than that of @xcite , which is not surprising since the spherical ensemble uses complex functions and is thus of a different nature .    an alternative natural interpretation of krishnapur s result is to consider eigenvalues @xmath38 of the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath39 and to identify @xmath40 with the riemann sphere .",
    "an homotety then generates the points in the unit sphere @xmath27 .",
    "this remark suggests that the spherical ensemble can be seen as a natural point process in the complex projective space , and a search for an extension to higher dimensions is in order . in this paper",
    "we extend this process in a very natural manner to @xmath41 for any @xmath42",
    ". we will propose the name _ projective ensemble_.    in order to show the separation properties of the projective ensemble we will define a ( probably non  determinantal ) point process in odd  dimensional spheres , which will allow us to compare our results to those of @xcite .",
    "this point process is as follows : first , choose a number @xmath43 of points in @xmath41 coming from the projective ensemble .",
    "then , consider @xmath44 equally spaced unit norm affine representatives of each of the projective points .",
    "we allow these points to be rotated by a randomly chosen phase . as a result",
    ", we get @xmath45 points in the odd  dimensional sphere @xmath46 .",
    "we study the expected @xmath1energy of such a point process .",
    "our first main result can be succinctly written as follows .",
    "[ th : main ] with the notations above ,    @xmath47    the bound in theorem [ th : main ] is larger than that of , which shows that random configurations of points coming from this point process are , at least from the point of view of the @xmath1energy , better distributed than those coming from the harmonic ensemble .",
    "see figure [ fig : comparacion ] for a graphical comparison of both bounds .",
    "since the point process we have defined in @xmath48 starts by choosing points in @xmath41 coming from the projective ensemble , theorem [ th : main ] gives us arguments to think that the projective ensemble produces quite well distributed points in @xmath41 ( for @xmath49 this property is quantitatively described in @xcite ) .",
    "there are several ways to measure how well distributed a collection of points is in @xmath41 .",
    "for example , one can study the natural analogues of riesz s energy as in theorem [ prop_proy ] below .",
    "a very natural measure is given by the value of _ green s energy _ of @xcite : let @xmath50 $ ] be the green function of @xmath41 , that is , @xmath51 is zero",

    "* main theorem ) ) .",
