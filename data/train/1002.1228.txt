    "the scattering theory of polarised neutrons including magnetic interactions started with the early work of by halpern and johnson @xcite and has been essentially completed by blume@xcite and maleyev@xcite more than fourty years ago .",
    "the major milestones in development of experimental means and applications have been set by technique of longitudinal polarisation analysis ( moon _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and by spherical neutron polarimetry ( tasset and brown ) @xcite , which nowadays provides a high precision tool to analyse the full polarisation tensor for single crystal magnetic scattering .",
    "the development for diffuse scattering utilizing a wide angle detector has been essentially driven by schrpf , who established with _ his _",
    "d7 instrument at the ill and the so - called xyz method@xcite efficient means for measuring and analysing spin - correlations in powder samples . with recent instrumental progress ,",
    "the d7 at ill @xcite and the dns at jcns @xcite have gained the required efficiency to explore more routinely the diffuse magnetic scattering from single crystals . to overcome the pending problem that the xyz - method is invalid for the separation of the more complex scattering from single crystals , here an appropriate extension of the xyz - method",
    "is derived using the symmetry properties of the polarised scattering .",
    "the present study revisits the polarised scattering from single crystals with the useful achievement of a proper separation based on the xyz - method .",
    "that will certainly be useful for exploring the complexity of disorder involving magnetic properties .",
    "according to blume @xcite and maleyev @xcite the neutron scattering process including magnetic interactions can be completely described by two master equations , eq.(1 ) for the scattering cross - section , here for brevity denoted by the intensity @xmath0 , and eq.(2 ) for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the final polarization : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the nuclear structure factor and @xmath5 , is the vector of dipolar magnetic interaction of magnetic moments with the neutron spin , and @xmath6 is the unit vector along the direction of the scattering vector @xmath7 .",
    "accordingly , the parallel components to the scattering vector @xmath7 do not contribute to magnetic scattering .",
    "here , @xmath8 denotes the fourier transform of the magnetic moments .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the nuclear spin - incoherent scattering , assuming that the nuclear spins are randomly oriented .",
    "this diffuse background , which is usually small compared to magnetic and nuclear bragg peaks , can be relatively large when considering diffuse magnetic and diffuse nuclear scattering .",
    "the full information about the scattering terms in eqs .  ( 1,2 ) can be retrieved by spherical neutron polarimetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , the most convenient and standard choice of a @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12-coordinate system for the setting of the polarisation @xmath13 is to have one axis @xmath10 parallel to @xmath7 , with the axes @xmath11 and @xmath12 perpendicular to @xmath7 pointing in- and out - of the scattering plane respectively .",
    "however , when using multi - detectors @xmath13 can be set ideally parallel to @xmath7 only for a single detector . therefore , the xyz - polarisation analysis for multi - detectors the axes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are chosen to be in the ( horizontal ) scattering plane and @xmath12 to point ( vertically ) out of the scattering plane . in an excellent contribution to the present subject , the polarised scattering has been revisited and treated within the density matrix formalism by schrpf @xcite .",
    "following ref.@xcite we consider first the general case of an arbitrarily rotated @xmath10,@xmath11,@xmath12-system and the polarised intensities that can be measured in spin - flip and non - spin flip modes and their relation to the above equations . with the definition of polarised intensities and polarisation @xmath14 for any cartesian coordinate @xmath15 , the non - spin flip ( _ nsf _ ) and spin - flip intensities ( _ sf _ ) , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "respectively , have been derived @xcite from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) to ( 3 ) : @xmath18 eq .",
    "4 shows a well known result namely that only components of @xmath19 parallel to the neutron spin appear in the non - spin flip scattering and only components of @xmath19 perpendicular to the neutron spin can contribute to the spin - flip scattering and is exemplified for @xmath20 @xmath21 it is further worthwhile to note that with any specific choice of the coordinate system the average of non - spin flip and spin - flip intensities differ for the different directions @xmath22    so far we followed the analysis of schrpf . for a further analysis and separation of terms in the polarised neutron scattering , here ,",
    "we continue with separating intensities in symmetric and antisymmetric parts .",
    "therefore , we consider scattering for reversed polarisation by the intensities @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are experimentally likewise accessible , and we obtain the analogue to eq .",
    "( 4 ) from eqs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) : @xmath25 in comparison to eq .  4 and 5 ,",
    "a further simplification is achieved by considering the average non - spin - flip and spin flip intensities , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively : @xmath28 showing the expected property of the unpolarised intensity @xmath0 @xmath29    by this we have eliminated the interference terms related to nuclear - magnetic correlations ( spin - orbit coupling ) and vector chirality terms ( cross products ) that now appear in the corresponding averaged deviations @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , : @xmath32 eq .",
    "( 7 ) reveals a well known result that is the basis of experiments with polarized neutrons using polarisation reversal without polarisation analysis . for the purpose of separating the interference terms due to chirality or due to nuclear - magnetic correlations ,",
    "polarisation analysis is actually not required and can be achieved by setting @xmath33 , with polarisation reversal , either parallel ( for chirality ) or perpendicular ( for nuclear - magnetic interference ) to the scattering vector @xmath7 . however , as can be seen , eq .  ( 7 ) also provides a complete separation of these terms for any choice of the cartesian coordinate system if polarisation analysis is applied .",
    "finally , one may note that it is also straightforward to derive this symmetry decomposition from brown s tensor representation of polarised scattering @xcite for the case of the standard coordinate system ( @xmath34 ) and also to include spin - incoherent scattering .",
    "the standard xyz - method has been successfully applied in many studies of magnetic correlations using powder samples . from the directional dependence of the polarised scattering",
    ", the purely magnetic scattering contribution can be separated by experimental means of polarisation analysis . for further interest",
    "the reader is referred to a recent and detailed review @xcite and a recent own study @xcite . here",
    "we shall briefly recall the fundamental equations ( eq .  8) , and discuss the additional potential of instruments like dns and d7 for studies of powder samples with polarisation analysis .",
    "an interesting consequence is that the interference of nuclear and induced magnetic scattering could be observed even for powders if chiral domains relate to satellites with different @xmath35 moduli or in presence of a symmetry breaking external field , whereas usually , chiral scattering is found in single crystals with a preferred domain orientation . in the following ( 3.2 )",
    "the central issue will be to separate and analyse the different contributions to the polarised scattering from single crystals based on the conventional tools of the standard xyz method .",
    "hence , the separation will be achieved without approximations only from diagonal intensity elements .      in case that orientational averaging applies ,",
    "e. g. for powder samples , we do not distinguish the components @xmath36 , and the magnetic scattering can be separated via the xyz polarisation analysis @xcite from the diagonal intensities . in case of only weak guide fields one does not need to distinguish the intensities with respect to the sign of polarisation        the information about the in - plane magnetic intensities , the square of magnetic amplitudes @xmath37 , is recovered from @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the magnetic , nuclear coherent and spin - incoherent scattering can be separated by combinations of polarised intensities @xcite @xmath39 here , we have assumed that the intensities do not change for a common polarisation reversal of initial and final polarisation .",
    "more carefully , for the application of this analysis we have to consider whether the antisymmetric part actually vanishes .",
    "this is fulfilled only if there is no distinguished direction by any external field .",
    "guide fields applied in the xzy method are typically in the order of magnitude of ten gauss and they are too weak to induce any significant sample magnetization in paramagnetic or antiferromagnetic samples .",
    "strong fields invalidate the standard xyz separation method , however , this allows for the study of the correlations and interference terms between nuclear and magnetic scattering amplitudes by determining the antisymmetric part of the polarised intensity , _ i d est _ measuring intensity differences for polarisation reversal . a unique response of chiral terms to an applied horizontal external field",
    "is less likely , although not impossible .",
    "a well - known strategy for single crystals used in a ",
    "half - polarised \" setup @xcite can also be applied to powder diffraction .",
    "such a determination of correlations between nuclear and magnetic scattering amplitudes from powders looks promising particularly for detectors covering a large solid angle without polarisation analysis . with respect to polarisation analysis of scattering",
    "it may be advantageous that only the difference of the _ nsf_-intensities contributes to the signal , and the background from _ sf_-scattering could be eliminated .      for a single crystal , even without applied external field , its intrinsic anisotropy and possible polarity may give rise to antisymmetric scattering contributions .",
    "therefore , the symmetry decomposition resulting in eqs .",
    "( 6,7 ) is important and helpful to analyse the polarised scattering and its magnetic contributions . for a cartesian coordinate system ( @xmath40 ) rotated by the angle @xmath41 around the vertical @xmath12-axis with respect to @xmath10 parallel to @xmath7 ,",
    "the following relations can be derived from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) providing a complete separation @xmath42 where the geometrical correction factors in eqs .",
    "( 10,13,14 ) stem from the projections @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the scattering vector , see comment @xcite .    compared to the information content of powder experiments , the study of diffuse polarised scattering from single crystals yields additionally the anisotropy of magnetic correlation functions , possible vector chirality and all nuclear- magnetic correlations , essential information about complex magnetic materials of high current interest .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that a separation of the chiral term has already been given earlier by eq .",
    "50 in ref.@xcite .    for diffuse scattering",
    "the typical experimental strategy is to map out scattering planes by stepwise rotations of the crystal around the vertical axis @xmath12 .",
    "note , the separation by eqs .",
    "( 9 ) to ( 15 ) is independent of the sample rotation @xmath45 and the convenient choice is a fixed coordinate system @xmath40 .    in order to interpret the magnetic scattering amplitudes in terms of the crystal lattice ,",
    "the in - plane component @xmath46 has to be decomposed further into independent lattice components in the plane ( ab ) and is given by the projections of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , while the vertical component is simply identified by @xmath49 .",
    "for orthogonal components , only the squares of @xmath47 and @xmath48 determine @xmath50 , see fig .  1 .",
    "note this example demonstrates that the considerations here also apply to inelastic scattering .",
    "the disentanglement of @xmath47 and @xmath48 is , analog to structure determination or to disorder in displacements variables , relying on sufficient information in extended brillouin zones of reciprocal space .",
    "diffuse scattering related to disorder phenomena typically implies an exponential decay of correlations in real space .",
    "hence a fourier analysis will efficiently reveal finite real space pair correlation functions , an approach that is a linear least squares problem having a unique solution .",
    "therefore , the determination of three dimensional pair - correlations functions requires accordingly measurements of more than a single scattering plane .",
    "with recent instrumental developments , particularly on the dns and d7 , diffuse magnetic scattering of single crystals can be efficiently measured with polarisation analysis , which has already provided exiting results on frustrated magnetism in spin - ice compounds @xcite ; a further example can be found in the proceedings of the pnsxm 2009 @xcite . for a systematic and thorough understanding",
    "the separation of the different components is essential , a task that to date has been believed to be incapable by the conventional means used in xyz polarisation analysis .",
    "the solution here , utilizing the symmetry properties , also places the emphasis on additional measurements with polarisation reversal .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that this request does not demand for more beamtime to achieve equal statistical weights .",
    "so far we have not considered the off - diagonal terms .",
    "these terms also represent the interference terms , eqs .",
    "( 13 - 15 ) , due to chiral correlations and due to coupling of spin - space and real - space variables .",
    "spherical neutron polarimetry of off - diagonal terms distinguishes these effects irrespectively of a possible depolarisation from different magnetic domains in the crystal . obviously , the diagonal antisymmetric polarised intensities eq .",
    "( 7 ) also reveal the mentioned interference terms .",
    "it should be noted that the same xyz - setup for multi - detectors can be used to access the complete polarisation tensor and off - diagonal terms can be determined with the same accuracy by spherical neutron polarimetry with precessing incident polarization@xcite .",
    "however , the here proposed xyz - polarisation analysis , a method based on only diagonal terms and applicable for multi - detectors , will certainly provide a much more convenient and efficient separation for the diffuse magnetic neutron scattering from single crystals .",
