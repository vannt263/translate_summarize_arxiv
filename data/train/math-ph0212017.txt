    "the jacobi version of the maupertuis principle establishes that the dynamics in a natural system can be viewed as geodesic motion in an associated riemannian manifold : if @xmath2 is the ( natural ) action functional of a system defined in a riemannian manifold , @xmath3 , the critical trajectories of @xmath4 with energy @xmath5 coincide with the extremals ( geodesics ) of the length functional @xmath6 defined in @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the jacobi metric @xmath9 .    in this work",
    "we analyze whether or not this idea works at the level of second - order variational calculus .",
    "namely , can the hessian operator of a natural dynamical system be viewed as the geodesic deviation operator of the associated riemannian manifold ?",
    "early on , it was pointed out that the answer is negative @xcite and consequently the stability criterion provided by the geodesic deviation operator ( geometric stability criterion `` ) does not coincide with the usual criterion based on analysis of the spectrum of the hessian operator ( dynamical stability criterion '' ) . we shall show that even in this situation the morse theory associated with the dynamical problem is the same as the morse theory built on the geodesics of the jacobi metric .",
    "the crux of the matter is that the jacobi weak stability criterion provided by the number of conjugate points crossed by a trajectory is the same from both points of view .",
    "there are several topics where the geometric criterion has been used , e.g. study of the chaotic behaviour of hamiltonian systems @xcite or the non - integrability of dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the jacobi - maupertuis principle has been extended to the case of lorentzian manifolds in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath10 be a riemannian manifold .",

    "thus , @xmath25 is the geodesic deviation operator .    in a natural dynamical system where the configuration space is the riemannian manifold @xmath3 , the dynamics",
    "is governed by the action : @xmath26=\\int_{t_1}^{t_2 } \\left ( \\frac{1}{2 } \\| \\dot{\\gamma}\\|^2-u(\\gamma(t))\\right ) \\ , dt\\qquad , \\label{action}\\ ] ] and",
    "the euler - lagrange - newton equations are : @xmath27 the local stability of a given extremal under proper variations is determined by the hessian or second - variation functional : @xmath28 and we shall denote the differential operator in the quadratic form ( [ hessian ] ) as : @xmath29 .",

    "a basic tool for the analysis of the stability properties of a given extremal of a functional is the study of the jacobi fields : the elements of the kernel of the second - variation or hessian operator .",
    "direct computation of the jacobi fields in a given problem is in general a very complicated task : one needs to solve the euler - lagrange equations , calculate the second - variation operator and , finally , determine the kernel .",

    "knowledge of the jacobi fields allows us to calculate the conjugate points along an extremal @xmath56 , and it is thus possible to apply the jacobi criterion for weak minimizers of a functional which counts the number of conjugate points crossed by the extremal as a measure of the instability .",
    "morse theory establishes a link between the topology of a manifold and the critical - point structure of the functions defined in the manifold @xcite .",

    "the aim is the application to the separatrix trajectories in the garnier system .",
    "a formulation of this theory  la bott @xcite is as follows :    let @xmath64 be the loop space in @xmath11 with a fixed base point .",
    "then , some of the topological properties of @xmath65 are codified in the poincar series @xmath66 , where @xmath67 are the corresponding betti numbers .    for any functional @xmath4 defined on @xmath65",
    ", we define the morse series as @xmath68 , where the sum is over the critical manifolds @xmath69 , formed either by a single isolated critical path or by a continuous set of critical paths .",
    "@xmath70 , the morse index , is the dimension of the subspace where the hessian operator of the functional @xmath4 , @xmath25 , along @xmath71 is negative definite .",
    "the morse inequalities , @xmath72 , tell us that the topology of @xmath65 forces the existence of most of the extremals of the functional @xmath4 .",
    "the morse index can be computed using the * morse index theorem * : _ the morse index of a critical path @xmath71 is equal to the number of conjugate points to the base point crossed by @xmath71 counted with multiplicity .",
    "_ note that this theorem is equivalent to the jacobi criterion for weak minimizers .    from this point of view ,",
    "knowledge of a one - parametric family of solutions @xmath73 of the dynamical problem ( [ action ] ) informs us about the geodesics @xmath74 in @xmath7 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the trajectories of the dynamical system and the geodesics of the jacobi metric , which only differ by proper reparametrizations .",
    "therefore , the two kinds of extremals share all the conjugate points , and the structure of the critical points of @xmath4 and @xmath75 is the same .",
    "the morse series coincide , @xmath76 , and the morse theories built from the trajectories in @xmath3 and the geodesics in @xmath7 are identical .",
    "as an application , we shall analyze the separatrix trajectories in the garnier system @xcite .",

    "we computed the separatrix solutions lying on the boundary between bounded and unbounded motion .",
    "we shall focus in the @xmath83 case for simplicity ( in @xcite the very rich @xmath84 case is analyzed thoroughly ) .    for any path @xmath85 in @xmath86 ,",
    "the lagrangian @xmath87 @xmath88 is : @xmath89 with no loss of generality , we have set @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "we shall only deal with the case @xmath92 , because the separatrix solutions in this regime have a richer structure .",
    "in fact @xmath93 generates a situation where the separatrices are reduced to a single singular solution .",
    "the system is not only completely integrable , but hamilton - jacobi separable in jacobi elliptical coordinates : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . with this change",
    ", @xmath97 is mapped into the infinite parallelogram determined by the inequalities : @xmath98 .",
    "the choice of the separatrix trajectories is achieved by setting the values of the two invariants in involution to zero : @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes the energy first - integral and @xmath100 is the second first - integral of the system , functionally independent of @xmath35 ( see for instance @xcite for details ) .",
    "this choice confines the dynamics to the finite parallelogram @xmath101 ( in cartesian coordinates it is the area bounded by the ellipse @xmath102 ) .    in elliptical",
    "coordinates the euclidean metric @xmath103 becomes : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "the christoffel symbols are obtained from @xmath107 replacing 1 by 2 , @xmath108 is equivalent to @xmath109 , and the same happens between @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , @xmath113 . the rest of the symbols are trivially related to these by symmetries or are null .",
    "taking @xmath117 , the equations of the motion can be easily integrated , even in cartesian coordinates , to find the solutions : @xmath118 .",
    "in elliptical coordinates , these solutions lie on two edges of the border of @xmath116 : i , @xmath119 , for @xmath120 \\sqcup [ \\arctanh ( \\pm \\sigma),\\infty ) $ ] , and ii , @xmath121 for @xmath122 @xmath123 $ ] ( taking @xmath124 ) .",
    "the geodesic equations of the jacobi metric reduced to the @xmath117 orbit become a single non - trivial differential equation , which is solved by a cubic algebraic equation : @xmath125 @xmath126 has been reparametrized to @xmath127=\\left[-\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{2}{3}\\right]$ ] .",
    "the explicit solution of the cubic ( [ jacobitk1 ] ) is @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",

    "this edge becomes the ellipse @xmath102 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "the solutions are either @xmath132 in @xmath97 , or @xmath133 in the elliptic plane .",
    "the geodesic equations of the jacobi metric reduced to the @xmath102 orbit also become a single non - trivial differential equation , which is solved by a cubic algebraic equation : @xmath134 the explicit solution of the cubic together with the elliptic orbit afford the geodesic : @xmath135 from @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "the hamiltonian associated with the lagrangian ( [ mstb7 ] ) , in elliptical coordinates is of the stckel type : @xmath138 and the integration of the hamilton - jacobi equation , for separation constants equal to zero , @xcite , leads to the equation of the orbits , @xmath139 and the equation of the temporal dependence , @xmath140 here @xmath62 is a constant that parametrizes the different orbits and @xmath141 is another constant coming from the time - translation invariance .    at the limit @xmath142 , equation ( [ mstbtray ] ) reduces to the singular solution @xmath117 together with the singular solution living on the``ellipse '' .",
    "thus , identifying @xmath143 with @xmath144 , we see that all the orbits are parametrized by a periodic parameter @xmath62 : the space of all orbits is the @xmath145 circle .          in @xcite",
    "the jacobi fields are calculated on the trajectories . here",
    ", we closely follow the same idea to compute the jacobi fields on the geodesics , which are the solutions of the equations ( [ mstbtray])-([sdependence ] ) .",
    "thus , we have a two - parametric family @xmath149 of geodesics , and , accordingly , two jacobi fields : @xmath150 and @xmath151 ; see section  2.2 .",
    "the first jacobi field is tangent to the geodesic because it obeys the invariance under @xmath40 translations .",
    "we focus on the computation of the orthogonal jacobi field : @xmath152 .",
    "an explicit formula for the geodesic @xmath153 in terms of known analytical functions is not available , but we implicitly derive the system ( [ mstbtray])-([sdependence ] ) with respect to @xmath62 to obtain a linear system in the components of @xmath154 : @xmath155          taking @xmath158 ; @xmath159 , we have the following critical point structure for the geodesics that start and end at the point d. firstly , the point d itself is a possible geodesic with a morse index 0 .",
