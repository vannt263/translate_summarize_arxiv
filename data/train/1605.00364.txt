    "<S> generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) encoding multidimensional information of hadron partonic structure appear as the building blocks in a factorized description of hard exclusive reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon gpds have been accessed by deeply virtual compton scattering and deeply virtual meson production with lepton beam . </S>",
    "<S> a complementary probe with hadron beam is the exclusive pion - induced drell - yan process . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss recent theoretical advances on describing this process in terms of nucleon gpds and pion distribution amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we address the feasibility of measuring the exclusive pion - induced drell - yan process @xmath0 via a spectrometer at the high momentum beamline being constructed at j - parc in japan . </S>",
    "<S> realization of such measurement at j - parc will provide a new test of perturbative qcd descriptions of a novel class of hard exclusive reactions . </S>",
    "<S> it will also offer the possibility of experimentally accessing nucleon gpds at large timelike virtuality . </S>"
