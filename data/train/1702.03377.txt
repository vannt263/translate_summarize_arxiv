    "confidence bands provide a simple graphical description of the extent to which a nonparametric estimator varies at design points , thereby quantifying uncertainties of the nonparametric estimator",
    ". however , construction of confidence bands tends to be challenging , especially for complex nonparametric models .    indeed , despite the rich literature on consistent estimation of nonparametric eiv regression , the literature on pointwise or uniform confidence bands for nonparametric eiv regression is limited  see below for a literature review  likely because of its complexity .",
    "even pointwise inference on @xmath6 under the assumption that the measurement error distribution is known is considered by experts to be difficult .",
    "this is because , as discussed in @xcite : 1 ) the asymptotic variance of the `` deconvolution kernel '' estimator of @xmath6 is non - trivial to estimate and so inference based on limiting distributions is difficult to implement ; and 2 ) it is not straightforward to devise a way to implement bootstrap for inference on @xmath6 due to the unobservability of @xmath3 in data .    with all these challenges recognized in the literature , the present paper attempts to solve an even more challenging problem of constructing _ uniform _ confidence bands for the regression function @xmath6 _ without _ assuming that the measurement error distribution is known .",

    "other real data scenarios of such additional data availability that are plausible in economics , social sciences , and biomedical sciences include : the case where validation data is available for data combination ; and the case where repeated measurements ( panel data ) on @xmath3 with errors one of which is symmetrically distributed are available .",

    "further , while both npiv and eiv regressions are statistical ill - posed inverse problems , the ways in which the `` ill - posedness '' is defined are different ; in series estimation of npiv models , the ill - posedness is defined for given basis functions , while in eiv regression , the ill - posedness is defined via how fast the characteristic function of the measurement error distribution decays . hence we believe that our inference results cover different situations than those developed in the npiv literature .",

    "<S> this paper develops a method to construct uniform confidence bands for a nonparametric regression function where a predictor variable is subject to a measurement error . </S>",
    "<S> we allow for the distribution of the measurement error to be unknown , but assume that there is an independent sample from the measurement error distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the sample from the measurement error distribution need not be independent from the sample on response and predictor variables . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of a sample from the measurement error distribution is satisfied if , for example , either 1 ) validation data or 2 ) repeated measurements ( panel data ) on the latent predictor variable with measurement errors , one of which is symmetrically distributed , are available . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed confidence band builds on the deconvolution kernel estimation and a novel application of the multiplier ( or wild ) bootstrap method . </S>",
    "<S> we establish asymptotic validity of the proposed confidence band under ordinary smooth measurement error densities , showing that the proposed confidence band contains the true regression function with probability approaching the nominal coverage probability . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first paper to derive asymptotically valid uniform confidence bands for nonparametric errors - in - variables regression . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a novel data - driven method to choose a bandwidth , and conduct simulation studies to verify the finite sample performance of the proposed confidence band . applying our method to a combination of two empirical data sets , we draw confidence bands for nonparametric regressions of medical costs on the body mass index ( bmi ) , accounting for measurement errors in bmi . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss extensions of our results to specification testing , cases with additional error - free regressors , and confidence bands for conditional distribution functions . </S>"
