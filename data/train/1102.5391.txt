    ", they apply the _ polynomial ham - sandwich theorem _ of stone and tukey  @xcite to obtain a partition of a finite point set @xmath1 in @xmath0 with certain favorable properties , detailed in section  [ s : discuss - partit ] below .",
    "the partition is effected by what we call an _ @xmath2-partitioning polynomial_. the removal of the zero set @xmath3 of the polynomial partitions space into connected components , each containing at most @xmath4 points of  @xmath1 .",
    "a key feature of the construction is that the degree of the polynomial achieving this need not be too high , only @xmath5 , and thus the interaction of other objects , such as lines or hyperplanes , with @xmath3 is under control in some sense .    in this paper",

    "we remark that the bound in the theorem is tight in the worst case for all @xmath17 ( see @xcite , @xcite for original sources or @xcite for a presentation ) .",
    "a simpler proof of the szemerdi  trotter theorem , based on cuttings , was given by clarkson et al .",
    "@xcite in 1990 , and in 1997 szkely  @xcite found a beautiful and elegant proof , based on the crossing lemma for graphs embedded in the plane ( also see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in section  [ s : sztproof ] we present an alternative proof based on polynomial partitions , hoping that the reader will find it equally simple .",
    "we also believe that the new proof is suitable for teaching purposes , so our goal is to make the exposition as elementary and self - contained as possible . for this",
    "we also give proofs of several well known and basic facts about multivariate polynomials .",

    "the szemerdi ",

    "a survey of the topic can be found in pach and sharir  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the following theorem on incidences between points and planar curves has been established :    [ szt : algeb ] let @xmath1 be a set of @xmath15 points and let @xmath18 be a set of @xmath16 simple curves , all lying in the plane . if no more than @xmath19 curves of @xmath18 pass through any @xmath20 given points , and every pair of curves of @xmath18 intersect in at most @xmath21 points , then @xmath22 with an appropriate constant of proportionality that depends on @xmath23 .    a weaker version of this result , where the the curves in @xmath18 are assumed to be algebraic and to belong to a family parameterized by @xmath20 real parameters ,",

    "spanning trees with low crossing number have many applications in discrete and computational geometry , including range searching @xcite , the design of other geometric algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , discrepancy theory @xcite , and approximation @xcite .",
    "the original proof of theorem  [ t : sptree ] constructs the tree iteratively , through a process called _ iterative reweighting_. in each step several new edges are added , and these are selected using a packing argument with balls in a line arrangement ( or , alternatively , using a so - called cutting ) .",
    "an alternative proof , replacing iterative reweighting with linear programming duality , was recently given by har - peled @xcite .    in section  [ s",

    "chazelle and welzl @xcite established their result on spanning trees with low crossing number in a very general setting , where the points do not lie in the plane , but rather in the ground set of an arbitrary set system @xmath27 .",
    "the bound on the crossing number is then expressed in terms of the _ dual shatter function _ of  @xmath27 .    at present",
    "it seems that the approach with polynomial partitions is not suitable for this level of generality . however , some generalizations are possible .",
    "first , we have verified that theorem  [ t : sptree ] can be extended to the case where the crossing number is taken with respect to a family of algebraic curves of degree bounded by a constant , but we will not pursue this in this paper .",

    "here we are given a set @xmath1 of @xmath16 points in @xmath0 , and consider spanning trees of @xmath1 , which we embed into @xmath0 by drawing their edges as straight segments connecting the respective end - vertices , as in the plane .",
    "the crossing number of such a tree is the maximum number of its edges that are crossed by a hyperplane not passing through any point of @xmath1 . according to @xcite , @xcite , for every @xmath16-point set in @xmath0 there exists a straight - edge spanning tree with crossing number @xmath29 .",
    "we re - prove this fact using polynomial partitions , similar to the planar case .",
    "however , the proof is more involved in higher dimensions .",
    "informally , the partition distributes the input points evenly among the resulting cells , except that some ( in the worst case even all ) of the points may lie on the zero set @xmath3 of the partitioning polynomial , and therefore not belong to any of the subsets .",
    "we avoid this situation using a perturbation argument .",
    "this works for the spanning tree construction because there we may assume general position of the input points . for incidence problems this assumption can not be made , and other techniques are needed to handle the points on  @xmath3 .",
    "we intend to investigate alternative approaches to handling points on @xmath3 in a subsequent paper .",
    "here we recall some standard facts about polynomials .",

    "thus @xmath31 is an @xmath2-partitioning polynomial for @xmath1 .",
    "it remains to bound the degree : @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "50 @xmath44 = 0    * a comparison with other partitioning techniques . *    the guth ",
    "katz technique with partitioning polynomials is useful for problems where we deal with a finite point set @xmath1 and with a collection @xmath18 of lines , algebraic curves , or algebraic varieties in higher dimensions .",
    "it provides a method of implementing the divide - and - conquer paradigm .    in the planar case",
    "discussed above , the plane is subdivided by @xmath45 into some number of ( open , connected ) cells , each containing at most @xmath4 points of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath18 consists of lines , then every @xmath130 intersects at most @xmath131 cells ( by lemma  [ l : atmost ] ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath18 consisting of algebraic curves of degree bounded by a constant , every @xmath130 intersects at most @xmath132 cells by bzout s theorem ( theorem  [ t : bezout ] ) .",
    "thus , if we define , for every cell @xmath133 of @xmath105 , a subset @xmath134 as the set of points of @xmath1 contained in @xmath133 , and we let @xmath135 consist of the lines or curves of @xmath18 intersecting @xmath133 , then @xmath136 for all @xmath137 , and the _ average _ size of the @xmath135 is @xmath138 .",
    "there are two earlier partitioning tools in discrete geometry with a similar effect .",
    "the first , and simpler , kind of them are _ cuttings _",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "a cutting for a collection @xmath18 of curves in the plane subdivides @xmath8 into a collection of connected , simply shaped cells , in such a way that no cell is crossed by more than a prescribed fraction of the curves of @xmath18 .",
    "if we again let @xmath139 denote the set of points of @xmath1 in the @xmath137th cell , and @xmath135 is the set of the curves intersecting that cell , then this time _ all _ @xmath135 have size @xmath138 , and the _ average _ of the sizes @xmath140 is for our  @xmath141 . ] @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the behavior of cuttings is , in a sense , `` dual '' to that of polynomial partitions . for many applications ,",
    "this does not really make a difference .",
    "the second of the earlier tools are _ simplicial partitions _ @xcite . here , as in the case of polynomial partitions ,",
    "the plane is subdivided into cells so that @xmath136 for each @xmath137 ( where , again , @xmath139 is the set of points of @xmath1 in the @xmath137th cell ) , and no @xmath130 intersects more than @xmath142 cells . , but they need not be disjoint . in a newer version due to chan @xcite , disjointness can also be guaranteed . ]    in the plane , as far as we can see , whatever can be done with polynomial partitions , can also be achieved through cuttings or through simplicial partitions .",
    "the main advantage of polynomial partitions is simplicity of the proof . on the other hand , cuttings and simplicial partitions",
    "can be constructed and manipulated with fairly efficient algorithms , at least in the sense of asymptotic complexity , which is not at all clear for polynomial partitions .",
    "( for example , finding a ham - sandwich cut in a high - dimensional space is a rather costly operation ; see @xcite for a computational hardness result and references . )",
    "polynomial partitions may be more powerful than the earlier tools if we pass to a higher - dimensional space @xmath0 , @xmath143 .",
    "asymptotically optimal cuttings and simplicial partitions are known to exist in @xmath0 , for every fixed @xmath28 , in the case where @xmath18 is a collection of _",
    "however , if we want to apply analogous methods to construct cuttings ( or simplicial partitions , whose construction needs cuttings as a subroutine ) for @xmath18 consisting of algebraic surfaces of degree bounded by a constant , say , then there is a stumbling block . in one of the steps of the construction",
    ", we have a collection @xmath144 of @xmath15 surfaces from @xmath18 .",
    "it is known that these surfaces partition @xmath0 into @xmath145 cells , but we need to further subdivide each cell into subcells , so that each of the resulting subcells can be described by a constant number of real parameters .",
    "there is no known general solution that achieves @xmath145 subcells in total , which is the optimal bound one is after for most applications . for @xmath146 ,",
    "the situation is still not bad , since bounds only slightly worse than @xmath145 have been proved , but for @xmath147 , the best bound is of order roughly @xmath148 , and so for large @xmath28 , the exponent is almost twice larger of what it probably should be ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the new approach with polynomial partitions might hopefully be able to bypass this stumbling block , at least in non - algorithmic applications .",
    "we recall that we are given a set @xmath1 of @xmath15 distinct points and a set @xmath7 of @xmath16 distinct lines in the plane and we want to bound the number of incidences @xmath9 .",
    "we begin with a simple observation ( appearing in most of the previous proofs ) .",
