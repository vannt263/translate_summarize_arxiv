    "under the suggestion of the pioneering griffith s approach to fracture in brittle - elastic solids , a variational model in fracture mechanics has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a requirement of minimality of the overall energy @xmath2  which accounts for the macroscopic deformation and the possible presence of cracks , and is defined by @xmath3where @xmath0 is the regular region occupied in the three - dimensional ambient space by the body , @xmath4 the spatial derivative evaluated at @xmath5 of the differentiable transplacement map @xmath6  the map defining the actual ( deformed ) place @xmath7 ",
    "@xmath8  the representation in @xmath0 of a surface - like crack occurring in @xmath7 , @xmath9 the elastic energy , @xmath10 a constant surface energy , @xmath11 the two - dimensional hausdorff measure .",
    "the map @xmath12 is also assumed , as usual , to be one - to - one outside @xmath13 , orientation preserving ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , and such that the global invertibility condition@xmath15holds for all @xmath16 ,  a condition allowing frictionless self - contact of the boundary while still preventing self - penetration ( for details on this last condition see @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath12 is an orientation preserving homeomorphism outside the subset of @xmath13 containing its jump set .",
    "the requirement is then that _ at each instant _ @xmath17 $ ] _ of a cracking process the pair _ @xmath18 _",
    "realize a minimum of the global energy _",
    "@xmath2with @xmath13 an admissible crack .",
    "admissibility is intended in the sense that @xmath13 is a rectifiable set ( specifically the image of a countable number of lipschitz maps ) with zero volume measure .",
    "the interval of time is then discretized and minimality is required at time steps .",
    "minimizers are pairs @xmath19 : the minimum problem has two variables .",
    "notwithstanding simplicity and elegance of this model , the evaluation of minima of the energy at each time step involves a number of analytical problems .",
    "the essential difficulty arises in controlling in three dimensions minimizing sequences of surfaces leading to the possible actual crack , or better to its picture @xmath13 in the reference place .",
    "however , when the entire crack is open , @xmath13 coincides with the jump set of the transplacement field @xmath20 . the convenient simplification of identifying cracks with the jump sets of displacement fields has been then adopted .",
    "bounded variation ( bv ) or special bounded variation ( sbv ) functions have been then involved as candidates to be minimizers of the energy considered as a functional of the sole @xmath21 .",
    "the energy is then considered as the one of a simple cauchy s body and minimizers are sought in a space of maps including candidates to be reasonable descriptors of the elastic - brittle behavior .",
    "remind that the choice of function spaces where one researches minimizers has constitutive nature .",
    "a difficulty has been however encountered : theorems allowing the selection of fields with discontinuity sets describing reasonable ( physically significant ) crack patterns seem to be not available at least in the current literature ( see @xcite for a pertinent review of the results along this line ; also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this kind of approach seems to be not able to account for partially opened cracks .",
    "in fact , in this case the transplacement field is continuous across the closed part of the crack although the material bonds are broken in the actual place .",
    "the description of partially closed cracks can have even stringent interest in the time - discretized procedure sketched above .",
    "in fact , when such a procedure is applied by taking into account a loading program described by time - dependent boundary conditions , a program implying even the growth of pre - existing cracks besides the nucleation of a new fracture at the @xmath22th instant , it can happen that the cracks may close even partially , and then they re - open at subsequent time steps .",
    "moreover , the discovery of physically appropriate crack patterns is another key point .",
    "such questions have been tackled from a different point of view in gmmm ( see also additional comments in @xcite , @xcite ) by using tools from geometric analysis .",
    "the skeletal features of the theory are listed in the ensuing items .",
    "( _ i _ ) : :    distinction is made between cracks and jump set of the transplacement    field , as in @xcite .",
    "the latter set is however constrained to be    contained within the crack pattern .",
    "differently from all previous    proposals , the crack pattern is described through measures over a    fiber bundle with typical fiber the grassmanian of ` planes ' through    @xmath0 , the so - called curvature varifolds .",
    "( _ ii _ ) : :    a generalized notion of curvature can be associated with curvature    varifolds .",
    "it enters the constitutive structure of the surface energy    along the crack margins . the resulting energy differs from griffith s    proposal for the presence of the generalized curvature of the varifold    and the energy along the tip in three dimensions . in this sense",
    "the    model is an evolution of griffith s scheme .",
    "the curvature - dependence of the surface energy has analytical advantages and permits the control of minimizing sequences .",
    "a theorem showing the existence of pairs of crack patterns and transplacement fields in appropriate measure and function spaces is then available ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has some implications :    ( _ a _ ) : :    the crack pattern results a rectifiable set .",
    "although it can be very    irregular , it has the features that our intuition assigns to a    fracture .",
    "( _ b _ ) : :    balance equations can be derived in weak form from the first variation    even for a _ generic _ rectifiable set .",
    "notice that if a crack is    assumed to be coincident with the discontinuity set of the    transplacement field only , to obtain balance equations , stronger    regularity assumptions on the geometry of the crack pattern are    necessary ( see detailed analyses in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,    @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these consequences imply that , beyond the analytical advantages , the physical meaning of items ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) deserves additional analyses .",
    "they can be developed by going along the essential steps of the theory .      in continuum",
    "mechanics the choice of function spaces as ambient for solutions to equilibrium or evolution problems has constitutive nature .",
    "the properties of the members of a given space carry a physical meaning about .",
    "the characteristic physical features of the problem under analysis have then to address the functional choice . in the case under scrutiny ,",
    "the idea is that the material is elastic - brittle .",
    "it means that the material is elastic up to a certain threshold after which a crack is created while outside the crack the material is still in elastic phase .",
    "the threshold can be expressed in terms of deformation , stress , energy , depending on circumstances . moreover , as it will be clear later , the threshold can be also not expressed directly .",
    "it is , in a sense , included in the choice of the function space that one selects .",
    "let us focus the attention on pure elasticity first .",
    "if the material is purely elastic , it can deform at will , without any threshold and , in principle , without end .",
    "the deformation can be also perfectly recovered , after unloading . in this sense ,",
    "phenomena like cavitation in solids are ascribed to elastic - brittle behavior rather than perfect elastic setting .",
    "if this view is accepted , the consequence would be that a perfectly ( hyper)elastic body should be such that any compatible transplacement ( or displacement , depending on the choice ) field does not describe the nucleation of fractures or holes .",
    "it is well known that under conditions of polyconvexity of the elastic energy density , minimizers of the elastic energy of a simple body can be found in the sobolev space @xmath128  a space hosting maps with first distributional derivative having integrable @xmath129power , i.e. the first derivative is in @xmath130 . however , when @xmath131 non negligible is the presence of transplacement maps with graphs admitting boundaries with projections into the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "such boundaries describe the formation of ` holes ' and/or open ` fractures ' of various nature , so they are undesirable when a purely elastic material is under analysis , at least if the view on elasticity sketched above is accepted .",
    "the difficulty can be overcame .",
    "in fact , there is a global way to check  eventually to control  the presence of boundaries in the graph of a map with projection into the domain of the map itself through linear functionals .",
    "indicate them by @xmath132 , with the indices @xmath21 suggesting that the functional @xmath133 is associated with the transplacement @xmath21 . in the case",
    "treated here , such functionals are linear over smooth @xmath134forms with compact support in @xmath135 . the general technique , which is valid in any finite dimension @xmath136 of the ambient space , is described in the monograph @xcite .",
    "here , i sketch only minimal ideas , furnishing the essential picture and physical interpretations in the case under scrutiny .    preliminarily ,",
    "remind that a @xmath137vector over a linear space @xmath138 is a rank@xmath139 skew - symmetric tensor , that is an element of the skew - symmetrization of @xmath140 .",
    "the space of @xmath137vectors is indicated here by @xmath141 .",
    "it has a natural dual @xmath142 .",
    "any map of the type @xmath143 is called a @xmath137form as a real vector bundle over @xmath1 of fiber dimension @xmath136 , that is a family of @xmath87dimensional vector spaces parametrized by points of @xmath0 . ] .",
    "the space of all @xmath144forms of the type just defined is indicated by @xmath145    for the mechanics treated here interesting is the case of @xmath134vectors over @xmath146 , the space hosting the graph of the deformation . consider a deformation ( transplacement ) @xmath147 , @xmath5 . amid all possible @xmath134vectors over @xmath148 ,",
    "it is possible to define at every @xmath5 the @xmath134vector @xmath149 associated with the gradient of deformation @xmath150 .",
    "detailed definition and various properties can be found in @xcite , here , for the expository purposes declared at the beginning , it is only necessary to know that at each @xmath25 its components are the entries of @xmath4 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 . in @xmath149 ,",
    "then , all elements characterizing the deformation of lines , areas , and volume of the body in @xmath1 are included . in this sense",
    ", @xmath149 characterizes completely the deformation .",
    "its dual counterpart ",
    "the value at the same @xmath25 of some form in @xmath153  is then a sort of generalized stress .",
    "given a transplacement @xmath6 , @xmath154 , the @xmath134**current integration * * @xmath132 ( * current * for short ) over the graph of @xmath21 is defined to be a linear functional over smooth @xmath134forms @xmath155 with compact support in @xmath156 , namely@xmath157where the angle brackets indicate the natural action over @xmath158 of its dual counterpart , that is the part of the graph that can be seen as the graph of lipshitz maps . ] .",
    "essentially , @xmath159  plays the role of generalized internal power .",
    "the number @xmath160 indicates here the so - called * mass of the current * and is defined by@xmath161where @xmath162 is the modulus of @xmath163 , evaluated in the standard way for tensors .",
    "the symbol @xmath164 indicates the * total variation * of the current and is defined as usual for functionals .",
    "a * boundary current * can be associated with @xmath132 : it is indicated by @xmath165 and defined by duality , that is and acts as @xmath166 . ]",
    "@xmath167with @xmath168 the space of @xmath169forms over @xmath148  with compact support in @xmath170 .",
    "the notion of boundary current has not only formal nature .",
    "it has an immediate physical interpretation : when the graph of @xmath21 is free of boundaries inside the interior of @xmath0 , @xmath171 for any @xmath172 .",
    "essentially , this zero boundary condition prevents the formation of cracks or holes inside the actual place @xmath173 of the body .",
    "such a condition has been used ( see @xcite and the other references of its authors mentioned therein ) to define a class of transplacements  the so - called * * weak diffeomorphisms * * _ _  _ _  which is ` constitutively ' an appropriate choice for describing what one imagines to be a pure elastic deformation , as sketched above .",
    "here the situation is a bit more complicated .",
    "the deformation has to be a weak diffeomorphism outside a subset of the support of the varifolds describing the crack pattern , if the minimizing procedure provides a non - empty family of minimizing varifolds .",
    "inside that subset , the transplacement admits jumps , so it is not purely a weak diffeomorphism .",
    "the definition has natural extension in @xmath186 : the summation in the item ( _ v _ ) should be extended up to @xmath121 .",
    "of course , the definition of currents and related boundaries holds in dimension @xmath136 : in that case @xmath149 is tested over @xmath87forms .  here and in the whole paper , the restriction @xmath187 is essentially motivated by the physics under scrutiny ( see @xcite for the abstract theory ) .",
    "the first item indicates the possibility of evaluating the gradient of deformation .",
    "the second item is another regularity condition .",
    "it implies that one can in principle measure the average of the gradient of deformation , the volume change , the overall deformation of surfaces .",
    "the third item is the standard condition that a transplacement be an orientation preserving map",
    ". item ( _ iv _ ) is the condition mentioned at the beginning of section 1 .",
    "it permits to move @xmath0 along @xmath21  into a region @xmath188 in such a way that self - contact between parts of the boundary @xmath189 be allowed while self - penetration excluded .",
    "notice that in item ( _ v _ ) the action of the projector @xmath190 on the total variation of the boundary current is motivated by the fact that the latter behaves substantially as a measure .",
    "essential properties for the space of extended weak diffeomorphisms are shown in @xcite ( see there the relevant theorems and proofs ) .",
    "standard weak diffeomorphisms are @xmath191 maps that satisfy the items ( _ ii _ ) , ( _ iii _ ) , ( _ iv _ ) in previous definition while item ( _ v _ ) which is substituted by the zero boundary condition @xmath192 for any @xmath193 . from a kinematic point of view , in going from @xmath194 to @xmath195 , one transits from pure elastic setting to elastic - brittle behavior .    in this sense ,",
    "the requirement of minimality of the energy includes the possibility of finding minimizers  if any  in terms of weak diffeomorphisms and null varifolds , and in terms of extended weak diffeomorphisms and non - null varifolds .",
    "the transition from a situation to another is morally the threshold from the elastic to the elastic - brittle behavior . in this sense ,",
    "also , there is no need in principle of adding another condition defining the threshold itself .",
    "there could be also minimizers for which the transplacement field is simply a weak diffeomorphism but the varifolds are not null .",
    "this situation describes presence of closed cracks only : in other words , material bonds are broken but the crack remains closed and the transplacement field does not jump across the crack facies .",
    "such a situation can occur in a step - by - step minimization program obtained by updating in time steps the boundary conditions and requiring minimality of the energy at each step . at the step @xmath196 a crack pattern can occur",
    ", at the step @xmath197 the deformation closes the cracks , at the step @xmath198 there is a purely elastic continuation , then , at further steps , new crack patterns accrue .    of course , proving existence of minimizers is a crucial step for attributing sense to the previous reasonings .",
    "existence depends on the characteristic properties of the energy and the boundary conditions .",
    "once the existence of minimizers is established , the characterization of them along the physical suggestions collected above is matter of regularity theorems .",
    "the question is open .",
    "actually , any regularity theorem is available .",
    "different is the case of the existence problem .",
    "the technique discussed previously is a general tool for the description of phenomena in which energy can in principle be concentrated over submanifolds of a certain manifold , and this energy depends on the geometry of the submanifold itself .",
    "it can be used to analyze either specific situations of physical interest or to formulate and analyze abstract mathematical problems .    *",
    "phenomena of physical interest that can be described by using the tools mentioned hitherto deal for example with the mechanics of linear defects like dislocations and discontinuity surfaces . for dislocations the choice of the varifolds play a crucial role . for interfaces ,",
    "the functional setting has to be changed and a new special class of extended weak diffeomorphisms arises .",
    "the new choice requires proof of completeness of the new functional class and evaluation of the applicability of lower semicontinuity results . *",
    "another point of discussion is also the evaluation of the crack nucleation and growth in complex bodies .",
    "the adjective ` complex ' distinguishes bodies characterized by a prominent influence of changes in material texture ( the * microstructure * ) on the macroscopic behavior , an influence exerted through inner actions requiring a representation going beyond the common picture in terms of standard stresses .",
    "quasicrystals , ferroelectrics , magnetoelastic materials , polymeric bodies of various nature , including elastomers , fullerene - based composites , porous bodies , bodies with continuous distributions of dislocations , multiphase materials are paradigmatic examples . notwithstanding",
    "the variety of special models , a unitary picture of the mechanics of complex bodies exists . within it ,",
    "the representation of bodies goes beyond standard cauchy s approach in the sense that every material element is viewed as a system rather than a black box individuated by a single point in the ambient space , which is cauchy s view .",
    "such a description is multifield and intrinsically multiscale .",
    "a * morphological descriptor * field @xmath247 , @xmath248 , of the essential geometrical features of the material microstructure is then introduced . to construct the essential structures of the relevant mechanics ,",
    "it is just necessary to presume that @xmath249 is an element of a set @xmath250 which has just the structure of a differentiable manifold .",
    "it is assumed to be finite - dimensional for the sake of simplicity .",
    "@xmath250 is called the * manifold of substructural shapes*. the interest of mentioning here complex bodies is motivated by data showing that the microstructural changes may influence in non negligible way the force driving crack tips along evolution processes . theoretical analysis of this phenomenon within the setting of the general model building framework of the mechanics of complex bodies ( that is without specifying the type of microstructure ) has been developed in @xcite from a point of view different from the one adopted here .",
    "the simplest extension of the theory discussed here to complex bodies is given by an energy of the type@xmath251with the natural modifications in generic dimension @xmath136 .",
    "in analyzing the existence of minimizers , an essential point is the choice of the space hosting the morphological descriptor maps .",
    "such a choice could require the embedding of @xmath250 into a linear space .",
    "such embedding always exists because @xmath250 is finite dimensional , also it can be isometric when @xmath252 is riemannian . in all cases , however , it is not unique so that it becomes a ingredient of the model , a sort of constitutive choice .",
    "another point is the link of the jump set of the morphological descriptor field with the varifolds . here",
    "the underlying physics is subtle . in principle",
    "one can accept that @xmath247 may have jumps even outside the support of the varifolds and there it may be even continuous .",
    "jumps outside the varifolds can be justified by the formation of domains of microstructures , like polarization or magnetization domains .",
    "the meaning of the possible continuity on the support of the varifolds is associated with the question whether in cracking a body one alters along the margins of the crack the microstructure , in a sense determining a new type of microstructure , or , else , the microstructure remains the same across the margins of the crack . in the philosophy of continuum mechanics , the remark above coincides with asking whether a crack just divides neighboring material elements or breaks the material elements met in front of the tip .",
    "the answer can not be definitive and is matter of modelling .",
    "the situation becomes also more complicated when the structure of the surface energy involving the generalized curvature of the varifold is enriched by making more articulated assumptions .",
    "relevant investigations are actually open . * a point which may deserve to be noted is that the scheme discussed in previous sections has intrinsic similarity with the general framework of the mechanics of complex bodies which has been sketched rapidly in the last item .",
    "in fact , when curvature @xmath34varifolds with boundary are chosen to represent cracks , in principle the region where they localize is not known  in other words one does not know where the support of the varifolds is placed in @xmath0 , that is where the crack is . in this setting , every point can be crossed in principle by a crack .",
    "the minimization procedure tells us that the crack is here or there , before nothing is known about its position . instead of assigning to each material element a morphological descriptor",
    "@xmath253 selected in a finite dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath252 , _ one is then assigning to each material element a measure_. in this sense , the scheme discussed here is driven by the ideas of the mechanics of complex bodies , and , in some sense , it goes beyond them a bit .",

    "a definition presented in @xcite specifies the link : a family @xmath86 of @xmath34varifolds with boundary in @xmath87dimensional ambient space is said to be * stratified * when @xmath88 for all @xmath89 s . in the special case treated here the condition of stratification reduces to @xmath90 . * the choice @xmath30 for constructing @xmath37 and the associated varifolds allows one to consider not only two - dimensional cracks with the relative tips but also additional linear defects ( @xmath91 ) which can be cracks included in very thin tubes ",
    "material bonds are broken along a line for some reason  or even dislocations . in the latter case",
    ", through a one - dimensional varifold one can describe dislocations emanating from a crack tip in a three - dimensional body . in the former case one",
    "manages crack patterns stratified over various dimensions .",
    "of course , the analogous description can be adopted in space dimension @xmath92 and stratification of defects of various nature can be accounted for .    a new form of the energy for a body undergoing fractures , based on the description of cracks in terms of varifolds , has been proposed in @xcite ( see also comments in @xcite , @xcite ) . such an energy is indicated below by @xmath93 .",
    "it differs from the expression @xmath94coming from the traditional griffith s proposal and is an extension of it . for a three - dimensional body it reads:@xmath95where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99  are constitutive coefficients .",
    "in particular , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 are positive numbers , so the contribution of the generalized curvature of the varifolds is always present , even if it can be extremely small .",
    "the density @xmath100 is defined as the difference @xmath101 between the * bulk elastic energy * @xmath102 and the * potential * @xmath103 * of external body forces*. a number of comments on its physical meaning are necessary .    *",
    "the addendum @xmath104 has the role of the last integral in @xmath94 , that is the role of griffith s surface energy : @xmath105 has the same meaning of @xmath106 in @xmath94 . of course , the first addendum is the bulk elastic energy with density @xmath107  the body is then simple but anisotropic  and coincides with the first integral in @xmath94 .",
    "the other terms are not standard . *",
    "the addendum @xmath108 counts energy along the tip .",
    "such an energy is proportional to the length of the tip itself , namely to the mass @xmath109  of the one - dimensional varifold supported by the tip itself .",
    "* the term @xmath110 adds possible energy concentrated at the tip corners where material bonds can be entangled in principle in a way different from the other parts of the tip .",
    "* the two addenda@xmath111mark in a more pronounced manner the difference with respect to @xmath112 . they have pure configurational nature : they do not involve directly the gradient of deformation @xmath4 .",
    "the first one accounts for the ( generalized ) curvature of the varifold describing the surface of the crack , the second one includes the curvature of the varifold describing the tip .",
    "influence of the curvature of the crack , above all in the proximity of the tip , has been recognized in @xcite , a work devoted however to other aspects of fracture processes , namely grinfeld s instability .",
    "the curvature here aims to account at macroscopic level of local microstructural effects at low scale , occurring in the cracking process .",
    "curvature energy can be associated with bending effects in breaking material bonds when a crack is determined  consider for example a material in which the inner bonds are modeled through beam - like interactions .",
    "a point has to be stressed : bending occurs in the current configuration @xmath7 while , as a function of @xmath25 , @xmath113 is defined over the reference configuration @xmath0 .",
    "however , when bending of material bonds in the actual configuration breaks the bonds themselves , such a bending has a configurational effect because it contributes to the mutation of @xmath0 due to the nucleation and possible propagation of a crack .",
    "all configurational effects are measured in @xmath0 , as it is commonly accepted .",
    "additionally , analogies with different approaches to crack analyses in complex bodies ( see @xcite ) and bodies with strain - gradient effects ( see @xcite , @xcite ) can be called upon to enforce the interpretation of the presence of @xmath114 as a configurational indicator of the effects due to latent microstructures .",
    "the terms including @xmath114 in the energy tell us essentially that , once boundary conditions are prescribed , one has to pay in energy for curving the crack .",
    "consider a rectangular planar sheet of a homogeneous material half of it including a straight crack in the middle as in figure 1 .",
    "apply boundary conditions in terms of transplacement ( dirichlet boundary conditions ) in mode 1 .",
    "if the boundary conditions are such that the crack can growth , it remains straight , unless some additional agency occurs paying energy in curving it .",
    "* consider a body in an initial configuration in which no crack is present .",
    "for example , @xmath0 is a three - dimensional ball .",
    "after some loading program , a certain configuration in which a crack occurs is reached .",
    "clearly one could consider such a configuration as the initial one .",
    "the possibility stresses the point that ` being cracked ' is only a relative concept",
    ". configurations  or better states  have to be compared to affirm that a body is cracked .",
    "moreover , in sequences of configurations ( or states ) in which one excludes the possibility of restoring cracks by gluing the matter across crack facies , an order relation has to be considered .",
    "such an order is given by monotonicity in crack patterns : if in a certain configuration there is a crack with respect to an uncracked configuration in the sequence , a subsequent configuration can have a crack pattern that coincides with or includes the previous crack . in terms of varifolds",
    "such a point of view is expressed by affirming the existence a family of _ comparison varifolds _ @xmath115 such that the family of varifolds @xmath116 describing the actual crack pattern is constrained by @xmath117 for any @xmath89 and @xmath118 .",
    "the assignment of @xmath115 does not mean that one is considering in a given configuration a pre - existing crack pattern always , because the comparison varifold family can be also empty . *",
    "the assumption used so far that the ambient space is three - dimensional has been accepted only to be close to the standard physical intuition .",
    "there is no obstruction to consider higher dimensional spaces .",
    "consider the dimension of the ambient space to be @xmath92 .",
    "the previous treatment can be extended to this case straight away .",
    "the only modification , including the expression of the energy is that the range of @xmath89 must be considered to be @xmath119 , at least in principle .",
    "the rest remains unchanged .",
    "this choice allows one to consider stratified families of defects at various scales with various physical meanings , depending on the circumstance . of course , there could be cases in which @xmath89 could not take all the natural values from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . even in three - dimensional ambient space",
    "one could have only @xmath91 , for example , being in the condition to consider only linear defects like nets of dislocations .",
    "such a case would deserve perhaps a treatment a part .",
    "the case of four manifolds , @xmath122 , could be called upon when the description of crack in relativistic elastic bodies is considered , with all the necessary changes in the representation of the energy , adapted to the relativistic setting . in this case , however , care must be taken because in the relativistic setting a representation of continuous bodies based on the back - to - label representation seems to be preferable .",
    "the circumstance then would change the stage and would include a sort of ` mixed ' representation of the energy .",
    "solution to this problem , if any , is a pair @xmath126 .",
    "minimization over a class of varifolds has the meaning of minimization over a class of bodies : every possible crack pattern represented over @xmath0 ( remind that nucleation andor growth of cracks occur in the current place ) defines a body .",
    "different crack patterns indicate different bodies : @xmath0 , in fact , changes .",
    "the family of varifolds @xmath116 represents the crack pattern  so it selects a body  and the field @xmath127 describes the deformation of such a body .",
    "the two ` objects ' are correlated .",
    "in fact , in the actual configuration possible nucleation , growth and/or opening of a crack are consequences of the deformation , the varifolds over @xmath0  are  representatives of what happens in the actual configuration .",
    "the choice of the function space hosting the generic @xmath21 is then another key point of the treatment .",
    "it has to be linked to the varifolds supported on @xmath0 .",
    "the existence result for the minimum problem stated above for the energy @xmath199 of an elastic brittle solids has been proven in @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions of dirichlet type can be presumed .",
    "they are given by prescribing the transplacement field along the boundary @xmath83 of @xmath200 .",
    "the discussion of the existence is developed by taking first a subspace of @xmath201 , precisely the space @xmath202 defined by@xmath203for some @xmath204 . essentially , the choice of @xmath205 with @xmath204 is a request of additional regularity which is sometimes necessary for physical needs .",
    "combination with the space of varifolds allows one to recognize a natural ambient in which the existence of minimizers of the energy @xmath93 can be investigated .",
    "such a space is indicated by @xmath206 and defined by@xmath207where @xmath208 and @xmath209  are comparison varifolds describing possible initial cracks . in particular , the subspace@xmath210with @xmath211 the part of the boundary of the body where the transplacement field is prescribed , takes into account the boundary conditions of dirichlet type mentioned above .    in all these definitions ,",
    "another regularity requirement is prescribed .",
    "in fact , the condition @xmath212 imposes that the essential supremum of @xmath21 is almost everywhere  with respect to the lebesgue measure  bounded .",
    "in fact , a priori it is not possible to exclude that , if one is able to prove under some conditions the minimality of the energy @xmath213 over some space of extended weak diffeomorphisms and varifolds , the minimizing varifold does not describe a fragmentation of the body  let say a crack cutting a piece of matter from the rest . in this case",
    ", a transplacement field could be such that the cut piece , now free from boundary conditions , can be translated rigidly to infinity . by imposing that @xmath214 , with @xmath215 a real number",
    ", then , one wants to avoid the situation just sketched .",
    "so , in this sense the assignment of @xmath215 has not properly constitutive nature .",
    "it is not related to some property of the material , rather it is a parameter selecting admissible deformation processes , admissibility considered with reference to the possible unconstrained extraction of pieces of matter from the body .    for @xmath136 the dimension of the ambient space and @xmath89 ranging from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , analogous definitions of @xmath216 hold and the theory can be generalized ( see relevant results in @xcite ) .",
    "another crucial point in the path leading to the proof of existence theorem of minimizers of the energy is the discussion of the structural properties of the energy .",
    "they have constitutive nature , of course .    in non - linear",
    "elasticity of simple cauchy s bodies , common assumptions about the structure of the energy @xmath217 are well known . by indicating by @xmath218  the space of @xmath219 matrices with positive determinant , the energy density @xmath9 is considered as a map@xmath220\\]]with values @xmath221 .",
    "remind that positiveness of the determinant of @xmath4 is the condition assuring that the transplacement be orientation preserving .",
    "the properties h1-h4 below are then assumed to hold .",
    "h1 : :    @xmath222 $ ] is * continuous * in    @xmath223 .",
    "h2 : :    the map    @xmath224 is * polyconvex * : that is there exists a    borel function @xmath225 acting    as@xmath226with values    @xmath227 ,    which is continuous in @xmath228 for every    @xmath229 , convex and lower    semicontinuous in @xmath230 for every @xmath228 , and such    that and @xmath150    on @xmath25 is now suppressed for the sake of brevity . ]    @xmath231    for any list of entries    @xmath232 with @xmath233 .",
    "h3 : :    the energy density @xmath9 satisfies the growth    condition@xmath234 h4 : :    for every @xmath5 and    @xmath235 , if for some    @xmath236 the inequality    @xmath237 is satisfied , then    @xmath233 .",
    "the physical nature of these assumptions is discussed in various treatises ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . the standard presence in the polyconvex energy of the determinant of the gradient of deformation and the relevant adjugate",
    "is summarized here in the functional dependence on @xmath149 .",
    "the choice is not only formal .",
    "it furnishes a rapid path toward the extension of the treatment to @xmath87dimensional cases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the essential point is to underline that , in the setting explored here , h1-h4 do not need to be supplemented by additional structural assumptions on the energy to assure the existence of minimizers of @xmath238 .",
    "the relevant theorem reads as follows :        * since no additional structural hypotheses besides h1-h4 of standard non - linear elasticity need to be added , the information about the possible nucleation of a crack or growth of an existing one is furnished by the presence of the terms ruled by varifolds in the energy and the _ constitutive _ choice of @xmath216 as functional setting .",
    "it is just the latter choice that avoids the introduction of an external criterion for the nucleation of a crack or the growth of an existing one .",
    "in fact , the energy is minimized over a class of possible bodies . * more in general than other descriptions , it is possible to determine the weak form of balance equations for crack patterns which are just rectifiable sets .",
    "the result is not discussed here for the sake of conciseness .",
    "it is presented in @xcite and opens the way to computational opportunities not explored yet .",
    "the balance equations derived naturally in @xcite  for very general crack geometries  as mentioned above the crack pattern has to be just a rectifiable set  are the ones obtained by horizontal variations , that are variations of the reference place .",
    "thus they have configurational nature : they involve in fact the hamilton - eshelby tensor and non - standard terms deriving from the variations of the terms including the varifolds , the ones directly related with the geometry of the crack pattern . *",
    "the existence result holds also at dimensions greater than 3 , provided that the obvious variations in previous definitions ( see @xcite , 2 for the abstract theory ) . *",
    "an analogous result holds also for the generalized energy@xmath244with @xmath245 a convex real - valued function satisfying the condition @xmath246 .",
    "the interest of this remark is not only technical .",
    "it gives a grater degree of freedom in selecting further constitutive structures under the suggestions of possible experimental evidences and numerical tests .",
    "* the existence result does not exclude the possibility that the minimization procedure foresees stratified varifolds supported on the boundary of @xmath0 . in this case",
    "one can say that a boundary crack appears .",
    "the meaning of such a boundary cracks is not exotic .",
    "in fact , on a part of the boundary where the transplacement is imposed a crack can occur so that the boundary condition is ` broken ' .",
    "consider for example a beam jointed at one of its ends .",
    "boundary conditions and properties of the material can be such that a crack occurs just at the interface between the joint and the beam .",
    "however , in principle a boundary crack can appear on a free part of the boundary .",
    "such a situation can describe the fragmentation of a thin film at the boundary , which is , essentially , the abrasion of the boundary itself ."
