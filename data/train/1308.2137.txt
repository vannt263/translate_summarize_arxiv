    "in 2009 , the thermal emission from the neutron star ( ns ) in the cassiopeia a ( cas a ) supernova remnant was fit using a carbon atmosphere model @xcite in order to obtain an emitting area consistent with canonical neutron star radii .",
    "the resulting average effective surface temperature was @xmath7k .",
    "subsequent analysis of _ chandra _ data taken over the previous 10 years indicated a rapid decrease in @xmath8 by @xmath04% @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis of _ chandra _ data from all x - ray detectors and modes concluded a more uncertain range of a 2 - 5.5% temperature decline , cautioning that a definitive measurement is difficult due to the surrounding bright and variable supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "the most recent results from the acis - s detector ( which gives the @xmath9 temperature decline between 2000 and 2009 ) are shown in fig .  1 along with the best fit line , and two lines indicating best estimates for the shallowest ( @xmath10 ) and steepest ( @xmath11 ) declines .",
    "we take the age of cas a ns ( hereafter cans ) in 2005 to be @xmath12 yrs based on the estimated date of the supernova @xmath13 yrs @xcite .    within the minimal cooling paradigm ( mcp ) , which excludes all fast neutrino ( @xmath14)-emission processes such as direct urca ( du ) but includes superfluid effects @xcite",
    ", the rapid cooling of the cans is interpreted as the result of enhanced @xmath14-emission from neutron cooper pair ( cp ) breaking and formation in the ns core ( the `` pbf '' mechanism ) , providing evidence for stellar superfluidity @xcite .",
    "other proposed models @xcite involve medium modification to standard @xmath14-emission processes such as modified urca ( mu ) and nucleon bremsstrahlung , or a phase transition to quark matter .",
    "neutrons in the ns core are expected to form cps in the @xmath15 channel , while the protons form @xmath16 cps . the pairing gaps and corresponding local critical temperatures @xmath17 for the onset of superfluidity are strongly density dependent , and suffer significant theoretical uncertainty .",
    "the maximum value of the neutron @xmath15 critical temperature @xmath18 determines the age of the ns when the pbf cooling phase is entered , @xmath19 , and can be tuned so that the pbf cooling trajectory passes through the observed temperature of the cans at an age of @xmath20 years .",
    "the core temperature at the onset of the pbf phase , @xmath21 , controls the subsequent cooling rate ; a higher @xmath21 leads to a steeper cooling trajectory .",
    "proton superconductivity in the core inhibits the mu cooling process , leading to a higher @xmath21 ; the width and magnitude of the @xmath16 proton pairing gap profile can thus be tuned to alter the slope of the resulting cooling curve in the pbf phase .",
    "@xcite find @xmath22k and proton superconductivity throughout the whole core is required to fit the position and steepness of the observed cooling trajectory .    in the mcp",
    ", three other parameters affect the cooling trajectories of nss @xcite : the mass of light elements in the envelope of the star @xmath23 , here parameterized as @xmath24 @xcite , the mass of the star @xmath25 and the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter ( nm ) .",
    "the thermal spectrum from the cans can be fit using light element masses @xmath26 and a ns mass of @xmath27 with a most likely value of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the presence of more light elements ( larger @xmath29 ) in the envelope increases the thermal conductivity there , increasing the observed surface temperature for a given temperature below the envelope @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the apr eos @xcite ; however , the nm eos is still quite uncertain .",
    "nuclear matter models are characterized by their behavior around nuclear saturation density @xmath30 baryons @xmath31 , around which much of our nuclear experimental information is extracted .",
    "denote the energy per particle of nuclear matter by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the isospin asymmetry , and @xmath34 is the proton fraction .",
    "@xmath35 corresponds to symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) , and @xmath36 to pure neutron matter ( pnm ) .",
    "we define the _ symmetry energy _ @xmath37 in the expansion about @xmath38 : @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath37 encodes the energy cost of decreasing the proton fraction of matter .",
    "expanding @xmath37 about @xmath40 where @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath1 are the symmetry energy and its slope at @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath1 determines the stiffness of the ns eos around @xmath44 and correlates with ns radii @xcite , crust thickness @xcite and the extent of so - called `` nuclear pasta '' phases in the inner crust @xcite .",
    "terrestrial constraints on @xmath1 from measurements of nuclear neutron skins , electric dipole polarizability , collective motion and the dynamics of heavy ion collisions @xcite suggest @xmath45 mev , although larger values are not ruled out .",
    "ab initio _ calculations of pnm with well defined theoretical errors offer constraints on @xmath43 and @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and constraints on @xmath37 from neutron star observations result in ranges of @xmath1 in broad agreement with experiment @xcite . in this letter we show that we can extract a conservative constraint @xmath2mev within the mcp using the cans data , and even more stringent constraints with reasonable assumptions about the mass of the star .    at the base of the neutron star crust , matter is frustrated and it becomes energetically favorable for the nuclei there to form cylindrical , slab or cylindrical / spherical bubble shapes - `` nuclear pasta '' @xcite .",
    "searching for observational signatures of the nuclear pasta phases is one quest of neutron star astrophysics @xcite .",
    "two rapid @xmath14-emission processes have been postulated to operate in the bubble phases of nuclear pasta : neutrino - antineutrino pair emission @xcite and du @xcite .",
    "we refer to these two mechanisms collectively as bubble cooling processes ( bcps ) .",
    "the neutrino luminosity from the bcps are comparable : @xmath46 where @xmath47k .",
    "compared with the mu neutrino luminosity @xmath48 , the bcp becomes competitive with mu cooling at temperatures below @xmath49k - i.e. at ages of order the cans .",
    "we thus expect the temperature to be lower at ages @xmath50 yrs with bcps active , and thus the pbf cooling trajectory shallower . in this letter",
    "we show that with bcps active , calculated cooling trajectories are only marginally consistent with observations , and only if the eos is particularly soft : @xmath51 mev .",
    "two caveats must be stated .",
    "the carbon atmosphere model is preferred _ solely _ on the grounds that the resultant emitting area is consistent with neutron star radii .",
    "other atmosphere compositions are not ruled out , and would result in changes to the inferred @xmath8 by up to a factor of 2 , changing the inferred ranges of @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath16 neutron and proton pairing gaps are quite model - dependent and might be significantly enhanced in the bottom layers of the crust compared to the model we use here .",
    "this would significantly suppress the bcps and weaken the latter constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate crust and core eoss consistently using the skyrme nuclear matter ( nm ) model .",
    "we choose the baseline skyrme parameterization to be the skiufsu model @xcite , which shares the same saturation density nuclear matter properties as the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) iufsu model @xcite , has isovector nm parameters obtained by fitting to _ ab - initio _ pnm calculations , and describes well the binding energies and charge radii of doubly magic nuclei @xcite .",
    "two parameters in the skyrme model can be adjusted to systematically vary the symmetry energy @xmath43 and its density slope @xmath1 at @xmath44 while leaving snm properties unchanged @xcite .",
    "the constraints from pnm at low densities induce a correlation @xmath52 mev . in this work",
    "we create eoss characterized by @xmath53 mev ; the resulting pnm eoss are shown for @xmath54 mev in fig .  2 .",
    "these skyrme nm models are then used to construct ns core eoss ( including compositions and nucleon effective masses ) with the additional constraint that @xmath55 @xcite , and consistent crust eoss , compositions , and density ranges for the bubble phases of nuclear pasta using a liquid drop model @xcite . the resulting transition densities are very close to the ` pnm ' sequence in figs  6 and  15 of @xcite . for a star of fixed mass , as @xmath1 increases , the stellar radius and crust thickness increases ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 of @xcite ) and the fraction of the crust by mass composed of the bubble phases decreases from @xmath56 at @xmath57 mev to zero at @xmath58 mev @xcite .",
    "we use the thermal envelope model @xcite , neutron and proton @xmath59 gaps @xcite ( model ccdk in @xcite ) , neutron @xmath60 gap , and pbf model @xcite used in @xcite .",
    "we use the publicly available code nscool to perform the thermal evolution http://www.astroscu.unam.mx / neutrones / nscool/. the neutrino emissivity for the bcps is from @xcite . we perform calculations at the limiting values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 , masses of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 and for eoss in the range @xmath66 mev .",
    "fig .  3 illustrates the impact of @xmath1 , @xmath25 , @xmath29 and the inclusion of bcps on fitting the _ position _ of the cans data .",
    "each plot shows cooling trajectories without and with the bcps ( solid and dashed lines respectively ) and for the limiting @xmath18 values of 0k ( no @xmath60 neutron pairing ) ( upper trajectories ) and @xmath49k ( lower trajectories ) .",
    "we plot the inferred cans effective surface temperature as seen by the observer @xmath67 - i.e. gravitationally redshifted from the surface temperature at the star @xmath68 where @xmath69 , a factor which depends on @xmath25 and @xmath1 ( the latter determining the radius @xmath70 for fixed @xmath25 ) . each pair of trajectories",
    "@xmath18 = 0k , @xmath49k , forms a cooling window inside which the observed temperature must fall .",
    "bcps narrow the cooling window from the higher temperature limit at ages @xmath71 : @xmath18 = 0k , the bcps have a noticeable cooling effect which lowers @xmath67 while at @xmath72k , free neutrons in the bubble phases have already undergone the superfluid transition and thus the bcps are suppressed ; we thus see little effect for those trajectories .",
    "it is important to note that enhancement of @xmath16 neutron and proton gaps will also suppress bcps , giving results closer to the `` no bcp '' cases presented here .",
    "a higher @xmath23 leads to higher @xmath67 for a given core temperature , as illustrated comparing @xmath73 -8 and -13 in figs  3a , b for @xmath74mev , @xmath75 ; the cooling window is thus elevated relative to the observed @xmath67 . as @xmath25 increases , the central stellar density increases and the fraction of the core in which the protons are superconducting decreases , making the mu process more efficient and the star cooler at @xmath76 . decreasing @xmath1 decreases the radius , thus requiring a higher surface temperature to produce the same stellar luminosity .",
    "these trends are illustrated in figs 3c - h .",
    "if the measured cans temperature falls within the theoretical cooling window for a given set of parameters , then one can find a value of @xmath18 for which the cooling trajectory passes through the average measured temperature @xmath77 .",
    "table i summarizes the ranges of @xmath1 for selected masses , @xmath29=-8 and -13 and with and without bcps , for which the cans data falls within the cooling window . considering the full ranges of parameters , a constraint of @xmath2 mev",
    "is extracted .",
    "fitting of the thermal emission suggests that the mass is likely above @xmath78 , which gives a more restrictive constraint of @xmath79 mev .",
    "the ranges for @xmath18 obtained with and without bcps when all other parameters are varied are @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively ; the inclusion of bcps leads to a more restrictive range .",
    "4 shows cooling windows for four sets of parameters ( @xmath1(mev ) , @xmath82 , @xmath29 ) = ( 30 , 1.4 , -13 ) ( fig .",
    "4a ) , ( 40 , 1.6 , -13 ) ( fig .",
    "4b ) , ( 60 , 1.4 , -8 ) ( fig .",
    "4c ) , ( 50,1.8,-13 ) ( fig .",
    "4d ) , as well as the curves corresponding to the value of @xmath18 that best fits @xmath77 .",
    "the limiting cooling rates given in fig .",
    "1 are indicated by the two straight lines intersecting at @xmath77 .",
    "calculated trajectories should have slopes between these two lines as they pass through the average temperature .",
    "even the 2% temperature decline is relatively rapid , favoring a relatively high core temperature at an age @xmath19 and thus favoring smaller stars ( smaller @xmath1 ) , smaller masses @xmath25 , a larger @xmath23 ( larger @xmath29 ) , and disfavoring bcps .",
    "note in particular , with active bcps the best fit cooling curve in the pbf phase is significantly less steep than without bcps , and matches only the shallowest inferred cooling rate , and then only for the lowest values of @xmath1 . as @xmath1 increases beyond @xmath83 mev , depending on mass , the curves become too shallow to match the data even with no bcps operating .",
    "the ranges of @xmath1 satisfying the _ slope _",
    "range of the cooling curve inferred from observation _ as well as _ the average temperature are given in the second part of table i.",
    "being agnostic about the mass of the neutron star in cas a and the mass of the light element blanket within the ranges inferred from fitting the thermal spectrum under the assumption of a carbon atmosphere ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , theoretical cooling curves pass through the average inferred surface temperature if @xmath86 mev . for a mass @xmath87 ( close to the most likely inferred mass of @xmath88 ) ,",
    "the range becomes slightly more restrictive @xmath89 mev .",
    "requiring the inferred cooling _",
    "rate _ to be matched within its range of uncertainty , the constraint on @xmath1 tends to become more restrictive still . with bcps inactive , @xmath86 mev ( @xmath4 mev ) for @xmath84 ( @xmath87 ) . with bcps",
    "active , cooling curves become shallower and we obtain our most restrictive constraints @xmath51 mev ( @xmath90 mev ) for @xmath84 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the latter constraints correspond to neutron star radii @xmath92 km for the eoss used here .    accepting the mcp cooling model and the accuracy of x - ray measurements and interpretation",
    ", we can conclude either : ( i ) efficient cooling mechanisms are active in the bubble phases of nuclear pasta and @xmath5 mev , or ( ii ) efficient cooling in nuclear pasta is suppressed , and @xmath86 mev .",
    "such suppression could occur if the high density tail of the neutron @xmath16 pairing gap profile or the low density tails of the neutron @xmath15 or proton @xmath16 pairing gap profiles enhanced superfluidity in the bubble phases .",
    "additionally , there might be other unexplored medium effects that inhibit the bcps such as entrainment of crustal neutrons @xcite .",
    "however , even at their most conservative , these constraints are competitive with experimental constraints @xmath93 30 - 80 mev .",
    "together , the physics of many aspects of a neutron star surface and interior affect its temperature evolution ; in this letter we have systematically examined the effect of two such aspects , namely the slope of the symmetry energy @xmath1 and the presence of enhanced cooling in the bubble phases while controlling for the behavior of other physical aspects .",
    "we must caution that we have not accounted for every possible parameter and variation thereof .",
    "we can not rule out atmosphere models other than the carbon composition model upon which the current @xmath77 is based ; use of other models would shift the inferred range of @xmath1 . broadening the range of the @xmath16 proton pairing gap would inhibit mu cooling even more : this would raise the temperature at the onset of the pbf phase , steepening the cooling curve .",
    "additional variations in the high density eos could also shift the inferred range of @xmath1 . as an example",
    ", @xcite find 1.8@xmath94 stellar models that match the cans cooling rate , whereas we do not .",
    "the apr eos used there gives a maximum mass @xmath95 , below the observed lower limit , so their high mass models will tend to be more compact and allow steeper cooling trajectories .",
    "stiffening the high density eos to increase @xmath96 above @xmath97 will tend to decrease the cooling rate .",
    "additionally , the crust model is not consistent with their core eos , and although their gap profiles reach similar magnitudes as those used here , the gap profiles are different .    despite these limitations , we have demonstrated that current cooling observations of the cas a ns have the potential to impose strong constraints on the slope of the symmetry energy @xmath1 at saturation density and demonstrated for the first time that enhanced cooling in the bubble phases of nuclear pasta can have an observable effect .",
    "continued monitoring of the cas a ns temperature over the upcoming decade could place some stringent constraints on that physics .    in the preparation of this manuscript",
    "the authors became aware of the preliminary results of a similar study ( http://www.nucl.phys.tohoku.ac.jp/nusym13/proc/nusym13_yeunhwan_lim.pdf ) constraining the symmetry energy using cas a temperature measurements , which are in broad agreement with our own ( without the use of cooling mechanisms in the bubble phases of pasta ) .",
