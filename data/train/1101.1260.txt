    "<S> * ( 6.12 ) ) .    a more serious problem is the fact that theorem  [ l : theorem - asymptotics ] is a quantization condition , and thus is expected to hold only when the geodesic flow is completely integrable , at least on the trapped set . for large @xmath1 , the separation of variables of section  [ s : separation2 ] is still valid , and it is conceivable that the global structure of the angular integrable system in section  [ s : angular - hamiltonian ] and of the radial barrier - top schrdinger operator in section  [ s : radial - trapping ] would be preserved , yielding theorem  [ l : theorem - asymptotics ] in this case . </S>",
    "<S> even then , the proof of theorem  [ l : theorem - resdec ] no longer applies as it relies on having gaps between the imaginary parts of resonances , which might disappear for large @xmath1 .    </S>",

    "<S> one way of dealing with this is to impose the condition that the geodesic flow is completely integrable on the trapped set . in principle , the global analysis of  @xcite together with the methods for handling @xmath52 nonselfadjoint perturbations developed in section  [ s : angular ] and appendix  [ s : prelim - grushin ] should provide the quantization condition in the direction of the trapped set , while the barrier - top resonance analysis of section  [ s : radial - barrier ] should handle the transversal directions . </S>",
    "<S> however , without separation of variables one might need to merge these methods and construct a normal form at the trapped set which is not presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to try to establish theorem  [ l : theorem - resdec ] without a quantization condition , perhaps under the ( stable under perturbations ) assumption that the trapped set is normally hyperbolic as in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this will require to rethink the contour deformation argument , as it is not clear which contour to deform to when there is no stratification of resonances by depth , corresponding to the parameter @xmath17 in theorem  [ l : theorem - asymptotics ] . </S>"
