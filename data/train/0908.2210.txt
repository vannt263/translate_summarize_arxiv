    "electron - doped cuprate superconductors have attracted more and more attention since its discovery  @xcite .",
    "this type of cuprates may have a great impact on our understanding of the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity , not only because of the common properties shared with the hole - doped cuprates , but also due to its unique features .",
    "the common points are that ( i ) the parent compounds are perovskite mott insulators ; ( ii ) the cuo@xmath14 plane is the key element responsible for the superconductivity  @xcite ; ( iii ) two types of carriers coexist  @xcite .",
    "the above items imply the electron - hole symmetry in the cuprate superconductors",
    ". however , the unique properties of the electron - doped cuprates are as following : ( i ) broad antiferromagnetic phase doping range , which can extend to or even coexist with the superconducting ( sc ) phase in some sense , ( ii ) narrow sc dome  @xcite , ( iii ) fermi liquid behavior with a quadratic rather than linear temperature dependence of the resistivity  @xcite , ( iv ) the order parameter symmetry , which does not come to a general consensus on electron - doped cuprates , while it has been accepted as d - wave type on the hole - doped ones  @xcite , ( v ) low sc transition temperature t@xmath1 and low upper critical field h@xmath15 , which give us the opportunity to suppress the superconductivity even at extremely low temperature by the magnetic field and explore the normal state properties , e.g. , the quantum phase transition and the anomalous upturn of the low - temperature resistance  @xcite .",
    "ln@xmath2ce@xmath16cuo@xmath17 ( ln = nd , pr , sm , and eu ) family with the so - called t-phase structure is the extensively explored material in the electron - doped cuprates . among them , la@xmath2ce@xmath16cuo@xmath17 ( lcco ) , with the largest ln@xmath18 ion radius  @xcite , has the highest transition temperature up to about 30  k. however , due to the difficulty to get rid of the excess oxygen to achieve the superconduting t phase  @xcite , lcco was first synthesized by yamada  @xcite in 1994 by a rather complicated precursor technique .",

    "also successfully grew the optimal doped lcco thin film on srtio@xmath7 by dc magnetron sputtering  @xcite . in this paper , we systematically study the fabrication conditions for the c - axis oriented lcco thin films on srtio@xmath19 substrates by dc magnetron sputtering method , including the deposition temperature and the deposition rate for various ce doping levels , ranging from heavily underdoped to heavily overdoped , i.e. @xmath20 . besides that , the optimal deposition conditions are discussed in detail .",
    "the sc dome in the phase diagram t@xmath8 is obtained and the optimal doping level is at @xmath5=0.105 with the highest transition temperature t@xmath21=26.5  k. by investigating the evolution of the resistivity @xmath11 and the differential hall coefficient r@xmath22 with the doping level @xmath5 , we find that the rearrangement of the fermi surface ( fs ) at the doping level @xmath5=0.15 .",

    "the targets were synthesized by conventional solid - state reaction  @xcite . to obtain the high quality lcco thin films , we carefully adjusted the sputtering pressure , the deposition temperature , the gas ratio of ar to o@xmath14 , the deposition rate and the annealing process for each doping .",
    "the background pressure of the chamber prior to deposition was less than @xmath24  pa . the total pressure during the deposition was @xmath25  pa with o@xmath26:ar=1:4 .",
    "the deposition temperature t@xmath27 for the lcco thin film is in the range of @xmath28c , depending on the ce doping level .",
    "more specific studies focusing on the optimal deposition temperature at different doping levels are investigated in part 3 .",
    "all the films used in the present work are typically about 100 nm in thickness , and they were patterned into the standard micro - bridge with 1  mm long and 500  @xmath29 m wide by photolithography and ion milling techniques .",
    "all the transport measurements were carried out by the quantum design ppms-14 equipment .",
