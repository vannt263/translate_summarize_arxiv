    "there has been considerable interest in the study of particle physics implications of the atmospheric @xcite , solar@xcite , lsnd @xcite and other neutrino experiments .",
    "the main purpose of such investigations has been to understand what theories could be responsible for the observed experimental features , which in the atmospheric and solar cases give strong evidence for large angle neutrino oscillations .",
    "one of these theories is the exact parity model ( epm ) ( also known as the mirror matter model ) which introduces parity or `` mirror '' partners for all ordinary particles ( except the graviton ) and thus restores the parity invariance apparently broken by the weak interactions@xcite .",
    "the epm predicts pairwise maximal mixing between ordinary and mirror neutrinos and provides a basis for an explanation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino data@xcite .",
    "this explanation does not require large mixing between generations and is also consistent with the lsnd experiment .",
    "another interesting implication of this idea is that the mirror nucleons / atoms provide a natural candidate for dark matter@xcite .",
    "this hypothesis can nicely explain some of the features of dark matter .",
    "for example , the heavy macho objects inferred to exist in the halo of our galaxy by the microlensing experiments@xcite can be naturally interpreted as mirror stars@xcite .",
    "if the dark matter is composed of mirror matter then it is also possible that some mirror matter exists in our solar system and in other solar systems .",
    "in fact a mirror planet could form very close to an ordinary star and may provide a possible explanation for the close - in extra - solar planets discovered around nearby stars@xcite .",
    "for other possible astrophysical , cosmological and geophysical implications of mirror matter see ref.@xcite .",
    "ordinary and mirror matter interacts through gravitation , and through the mixing of colourless and neutral particles with their mirror partners@xcite : neutrinos , the photon , the z boson and the neutral higgs boson can mix with their corresponding mirror states . mixing ( the former requires baryon number violation , while the latter requires flavour changing neutral currents which could occur , for example , in a two higgs doublet extension ) .",
    "] of particular concern to this paper is photon ",
    "mirror photon kinetic mixing , @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the field strength tensor for ordinary ( mirror ) electromagnetism , and @xmath3 is a free parameter .",
    "an important experimental consequence of eq.([lint ] ) is the mixing of orthopositronium with mirror orthopositronium@xcite , leading to oscillations between these states in a vacuum experiment .",
    "the subsequent decays of the mirror state are invisible , resulting in an effective increase in the decay rate@xcite .",
    "a longstanding discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and some of the experimental measurements may in fact be resolved by this mirror world mechanism@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these experiments suggest the value @xmath4 which is too large to be palatable for standard bbn@xcite , but is nevertheless very interesting because of its terrestrially observable consequences .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to consider in detail the physics of the photon ",
    "mirror photon mixing .",
    "the degeneracy between the ordinary and mirror photons ( both of which are assumed to be massless ) leads to coherence effects which should be taken into account when considering various processes involving ordinary / mirror photon emission , absorption and scattering .",
    "various interesting astrophysical implications will also be qualitatively discussed .",
    "in particular we will find that a small amount of ordinary matter at the center of a mirror star may make the mirror star observable . indeed",
    "such objects may already have been observed , but interpreted as types of white dwarfs .",
    "let us consider @xmath6 quantum electrodynamics containing an ordinary electron @xmath7 and photon @xmath8 plus a mirror electron @xmath9 and mirror photon @xmath10 , @xmath11 observe that the last term of the lagrangian describes the kinetic mixing between the ordinary and mirror photons .",
    "this term is gauge invariant and renormalisable and can exist at tree level@xcite , or may be induced radiatively in models without @xmath12 gauge symmetries ( such as grand unified theories)@xcite . because of kinetic mixing , it turns out that the physical photon is a particular linear combination of @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( as will be discussed in the following section)@xcite . treating kinetic mixing as a part of the interaction lagrangian",
    ", we obtain the usual feynman rules plus an extra @xmath13 mixing vertex shown in fig .",
    "1a .    to the lowest order in @xmath3 ,",
    "the @xmath13 propagator has the form @xmath14.\\ ] ] the interaction between the ordinary electron and @xmath10 ( also to first order in @xmath3 ) takes the form ( fig .",
    "1b ) : @xmath15 similarly , the a field interacts with the mirror electron via the diagram in fig .",
    "clearly one effect of kinetic mixing is to couple mirror electrons to ordinary electrons with an effective charge @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "there are also potentially other effects .",
    "for example , since the @xmath10 field interacts very weakly with ordinary matter one might expect that it could carry energy away from stellar interiors thus speeding up their evolution and , consequently , standard astrophysical arguments would place a strict upper limit on the coupling constant and therefore the mixing parameter @xmath3@xcite .    however , one should take into account the coherence between the emission of the ordinary and mirror photons @xmath8 and @xmath10 . thus the two diagrams in figs .  1b and 1d",
    "should always be added up coherently .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the new field @xmath17 which can be identified with the _ physical photon field_. the orthogonal combination @xmath18 does not interact with ordinary matter at all .",
    "we call @xmath19 the _ sterile photon_.    thus we see that in the interior of ordinary stars only the physical photon field @xmath20 is emitted or absorbed and the additional degrees of freedom corresponding to the field @xmath19 are completely decoupled . this observation has also been made in ref .",
    "we therefore conclude that the arguments based on stellar energy loss can not give us a constraint on the mixing parameter @xmath3 , assuming that the possible admixture of mirror matter in the ordinary stars can be ignored .",
    "the same arguments as above applied to the mirror star instead of the ordinary one show us that the mirror star would emit the _ physical mirror photon _ @xmath21 whereas the orthogonal field @xmath22 will be sterile with respect to mirror matter .",
    "we call @xmath23 the _ sterile mirror photon_. these four states ( @xmath24 ) are summarised in fig .  2 .",
    "next , let us discuss how one can detect ( in principle ) the radiation emitted by the mirror star .",
    "as explained above , mirror matter will emit the physical mirror photon state @xmath25 . to see how the physical mirror photon interacts with ordinary matter ,",
    "let us rewrite the field @xmath25 as a superposition of the physical photon field @xmath20 and the sterile photon field @xmath19 : @xmath26 if this superposition between @xmath20 and @xmath19 is maintained , then the mirror photon field couples to ordinary matter with the coupling constant @xmath27 while this superposition is preserved in vacuum , and in a medium of purely mirror matter , we will show that in _ ordinary _ matter it may be lost due to interactions with the medium .",
    "we introduce a @xmath28 reduced density matrix for the neutral gauge boson system in the @xmath29 basis , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , according to common usage , is called `` the polarisation vector '' ( note that this vector is completely different from the `` true '' polarisation vector describing the photon spin state ) . if the initial wave is composed of mirror photons , which are described by the pure superposition of eq.([8 ] ) , then the corresponding density matrix is @xmath32 where we have taken @xmath33 and normalised so that @xmath34 initially .",
    "suppose that the initially pure state described by @xmath35 propagates through a medium of ordinary matter .",
    "the physical photon component @xmath20 interacts with the medium , whereas the @xmath19 component is sterile .",
    "this is similar to an active - sterile two flavour neutrino system propagating through a plasma @xcite .",
    "the density matrix therefore evolves according to the bloch - type equation @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the projection of the vector @xmath31 on the @xmath38-plane , and the positive quantity @xmath39 is the total interaction rate for an ordinary photon with the medium ( including both elastic and inelastic processes ) .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side describes the non - absorptive evolution of the system .",
    "it can be viewed as a precession of the vector @xmath31 around the direction @xmath40 , similar to the precession of a magnetic moment around the direction of a magnetic field .",
    "the second and third terms on the right - hand side of eq.([12 ] ) describe the effects of interaction with the medium .",
    "the components @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by the off - diagonal elements of the mass matrix and therefore vanish in the basis @xmath29 .",
    "so , the bloch equation simplifies to the coupled system @xmath43 where @xmath44 is due to coherent forward scattering ( refractive index ) .    for the simple case of constant @xmath45 , the general solution of eqs.([13 ] )",
    "is @xmath46 + { 1 \\over 2}[p_{z}(0 ) + 1 ] e^{-\\gamma t } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_x(t ) & = & e^{- \\frac{\\gamma}{2}t}[p_{x}(0)\\cos{v_z t } - p_{y}(0)\\sin{v_z t } ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_y(t ) & = & e^{- \\frac{\\gamma}{2}t}[p_{y}(0)\\cos{v_z t } + p_{x}(0)\\sin{v_z t } ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_0(t ) & = & - { 1 \\over 2 } [ p_z(0 ) - 1 ] + { 1 \\over 2 } [ p_z(0 ) + 1]e^{-\\gamma t}. \\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effect of interaction with the medium thus forces the density matrix into the form , @xmath47 exponentially quickly with characteristic timescale @xmath48 .",
    "this density matrix describes a beam of purely sterile photons @xmath19 .",
    "note , however , that if the medium is perfectly transparent to ordinary electromagnetic radiation then there is no collisional / absorptive interaction with the medium .",
    "this means ( for example ) that in a refracting telescope , the radiation from a mirror star would behave like `` light '' which refracts very feebly , leading to a very long focal length , and so great difficulty of detection .",
    "as already discussed in sec.[4states ] , an ordinary star emits just the physical photon field so there is no observable effect of kinetic mixing .",
    "further , secs.[4states ] and [ decoherence ] examined the case of a mirror star , whose mirror photon flux @xmath49 will produce effects equivalent to a flux of approximately @xmath50 of ordinary light when encountering non - transparent ordinary matter . since @xmath51@xcite",
    "this makes the mirror star undetectable with present technology unless there happens to be a very luminous one very nearby .",
    "however , there are a number of other physical situations which would be expected to occur given the diversity and size of the universe .",
    "in particular , let us consider the following four possibilities    1",
    ".   ordinary star with a mirror matter core .",
    "mirror star with an ordinary matter core .",
    "3 .   ordinary star with an orbiting mirror planet / star .",
    "mirror star with an orbiting ordinary planet / star .    for the purposes of this paper",
    "we will qualitatively identify some of the implications of kinetic mixing .",
    "a detailed quantitative study is beyond the scope of the present work , but an interesting topic for the future .",
    "we assume that the mirror matter is confined within a radius @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the radius of the star .",
    "if @xmath3 is nonzero then the embedded mirror matter will be heated up by the interactions with the surrounding ordinary photons .",
    "it will lose energy by radiating mirror photons , which will be able to escape if they are emitted near the mirror surface at @xmath54 .",
    "an equilibrium situation will develop with the mirror matter having some approximate temperature @xmath55 at its surface . as the mirror photons propagate out through the star they will , through interactions with the medium , very quickly become sterile photons ( with a tiny fraction becoming ordinary photons ) .",
    "they will then rapidly escape from the star , thereby cooling it .",
    "we assume that the ordinary matter is confined within a radius @xmath56 , where @xmath54 is the radius of the mirror star .",
    "this case is just the mirror image of the previous one , so the dynamics of the system will be the same .",
    "however , in this case , the escaping radiation consists of sterile mirror photons ( rather than the sterile ordinary photons of the previous case ) . the sterile mirror photons will become ordinary photons when they interact with ordinary matter ( with a tiny fraction becoming sterile ordinary photons ) and thus potentially observable by us here on earth !",
    "therefore this case is potentially more interesting than the previous one .",
    "there will be several distinctive signatures of this radiation : its luminosity will be small ( depending on @xmath53 and @xmath57 ) while it can potentially be relatively high in frequency because the surface temperature ( i.e.  at radius @xmath53 ) of the ordinary matter , @xmath57 , can be larger than the surface temperature of the mirror star .",
    "thus , such an object would have roughly similar phenomenological characteristics to a type of white dwarf .",
    "in fact , there are types of white dwarf ( e.g.  dc white dwarfs ) whose origin is not well understood and may be candidates for mirror stars with some ordinary matter in the centre . perhaps a good place to look for mirror stars is in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "interestingly , several recent papers@xcite claim to have discovered faint moving objects in the halo with an estimated abundance consistent with the macho data .",
    "the interpretation of these objects as ordinary white dwarfs leads to a number of difficulties@xcite .",
    "it is therefore tempting to interpret them as mirror stars with a small component of ordinary matter in the centre .",
    "this mirror star interpretation can be distinguished from the conventional white dwarf case if the gravitational red shift of the spectral lines can be measured .",
    "light from white dwarfs experience much greater red shift than the light from the center of a typical star .",
    "also note that this type of fake white dwarf could have a mass exceeding the chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses : such an object would be a smoking gun for some sort of invisible clumped matter that happens to have acquired an ordinary matter core .",
    "the ordinary star will emit ordinary photons . through interactions with the medium ,",
    "these photons will mostly become sterile mirror photons when they propagate through the mirror planet / star .",
    "they will thus travel right through this object making it essentially transparent ( only a tiny component of order @xmath58 will be absorbed ) .",
    "the sterile mirror photons will then become ordinary photons when they propagate through ordinary matter ( which is what all our detection systems are made of ) .",
    "however in a realistic system one might expect the mirror planet / star to have a small amount of ordinary matter embedded into it which might have accreted over time ( from e.g. the solar wind ) . in this case",
    "the mirror planet can potentially be opaque , because the small amount of ordinary matter can absorb the ordinary photons from the ordinary star . in the particular case of the large close - in extra - solar planets ,",
    "this may well be expected because they would accrete a significant amount of ordinary matter from the ordinary star during its lifetime .",
    "a detailed study of the optical properties of such an object needs to be done in order to understand the opacity and albedo properties .",
    "obviously any ordinary matter inside the mirror planet will become quite hot and could be a detectable source of ordinary radiation .",
    "this system is the mirror image of the previous one . in this case",
    "the light from the mirror star may be undetectable , but the ordinary light emitted from the orbiting mirror planet may be observable if such a system is in our neigbourhood and still young .",
    "recently , the detection of `` isolated planetary mass objects '' has been claimed@xcite . in a separate work",
    ", we have proposed that these objects might actually not be isolated planets , but rather ordinary planets orbiting invisible mirror stars@xcite .",
    "this idea can be tested by looking for a periodic doppler shift in the radiation emitted by the planet .",
    "the physics of kinetic mixing between ordinary and mirror photons has been discussed .",
    "an important role is played by four linear combinations we have dubbed the physical photon , the sterile photon , the physical mirror photon , and the sterile mirror photon .",
    "because of the mass degeneracy between the two gauge bosons , quantum coherence effects have to carefully considered .",
    "in particular , the physical photon becomes a certain coherent superposition of the bare ordinary photon and the bare mirror photon .",
    "similarly , the physical mirror photon is another , but _ not orthogonal _ , coherent superposition of the bare states .",
    "one consequence of this is that purely ordinary stars can not lose energy through mirror photon emission .",
    "we have discussed the propagation of mirror ( ordinary ) photons through an ordinary ( mirror ) matter medium .",
    "this led us to consider qualitative observational signatures of some hybrid ordinary / mirror binary astrophysical systems .",
    "in particular , a mirror star with an ordinary matter core can phenomenologically mimic a white dwarf , and we have speculated that badly understood objects such as dc white dwarfs , or the faint halo objects recently reported , might actually be such hybrids .",
