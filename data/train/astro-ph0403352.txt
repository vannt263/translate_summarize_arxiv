    "our results at @xmath99 are in good agreement with ricotti ( 2003 ) , who simulated a @xmath82mpc box for small halos at @xmath100 .",
    "if the theoretical argument for the dependence of halo density profile on the slope of the initial density fluctuation power spectrum ( syer & white 1988 ; subramanian , cen , & ostriker 2000 ) is correct , as adopted by ricotti ( 2003 ) to explain the dependence of inner density slope on halo mass , it then follows that the neglect of density fluctuations on scales larger than his box size of @xmath82mpc in ricotti ( 2003 ) would make the density profiles of the halos in his simulation somewhat shallower than they should be in the cdm model .",
    "thus , the difference in the box size ( @xmath82mpc in ricotti 2003 versus @xmath16mpc for our simulation box ) would have expected to result in a slightly steeper inner slope in our simulation , which is indeed the case .",
    "another point to note , which is not new but not widely known , is that there is a large dispersion in the inner slope of order @xmath101 due to the intrinsically stochastic nature of halo assembly .",

    "( 2000 ) . therefore , while a  universal \" profile is informative in characterizing the mode , a dispersion would be needed to give a full account .",
    "this is particularly important for applications where the dependence on the inner slope is very strong , e.g. , strong gravitational lensing .",

    "the inner density profiles of halos steepen with time , consistent with the increase of logarithmic slope of the power spectrum with time , that corresponds to the evolving nonlinear mass scale .",

    "subsequently , the evolution of halo density profile may show distinct features and some conceivable correlations , not seen in figures 12 and 13 , may show up .",

    ". however , the distribution of the spin parameter among halos is very broad , with a lognormal dispersion of @xmath13 .",
    "this implies that consequences that depend on the spin of a halo are likely to be widely distributed even at a fixed dark matter halo mass .",
    "such consequences may include the size of a galactic disk and correlations between dark matter halo spin ( conceivable misalignment between spin of gas and spin of dark matter would complicate the situation ) and other quantities .    in figures 16 and 17",
    "we show the correlation between @xmath109 and the central density of the halo , and between @xmath109 and the environmental density , respectively .",
    "we find that there may possibly exist a weak correlations between @xmath109 and the central density of the halo , in the sense that halos with higher central densities ( or equivalently earlier formation times ) have lower @xmath109 , with a very large scatter , whereas no correlation is discernible between @xmath109 and the environmental density .",

    "we find that @xmath131 varies for different smoothing scales , with typical values around 0.2 , while @xmath127 remains roughly constant for each individual halo .",
    "however , @xmath127 is broadly distributed for all dark matter halos .",
    "figure 19 show histograms for the distributions of @xmath132 , for four randomly selected cases .",
    "we fit the @xmath127 distribution using a modified lognormal function : @xmath133 ^ 2\\over 2\\sigma_{a}})},\\ ] ] where @xmath134 is fixed through experimentation .",
    "tables 10,11 list fitting parameters @xmath132 and @xmath135 , respectively .    in general we find our fitting formula ( equation 10 ) provides a good fit for each individual halo .",
    "the distribution of matter at small @xmath136 is most relevant for the formation of central objects , such as black holes ( e.g. , colgate et al .",
    "2003 ) or bulges ( e.g. , donghia & burkert 2004 ) .",
    "our calculation indicates that the fraction of mass in a halo having specific angular momentum less than a certain value is roughly @xmath101 times the ratio of that value over the average specific angular momentum of the halo .      finally , we compute the peculiar velocity of dark matter halos .",
    "we find that the distribution once again can be fitted by lognormal distributions as equation ( 9 ) . in order to provide a good fit for the results at @xmath30 shown in figure 20",

    "we caution , however , the absolute value of the peculiar velocity of each halo , unlike the quantities examined in previous subsections , may be significantly affected by large waves not present in our simulation box . adding missing large waves should increase the zero point @xmath140 to a larger value .",
    "therefore , the peculiar velocity shown should be treated as a lower limit . in other words ,",
    "expected peculiar velocity of dark matter halos at these redshifts are likely in excess of @xmath141km / s .",
    "using a high resolution tpm n - body simulation of the standard cold dark matter cosmological model with a particle mass of @xmath28 and a softening length of @xmath32kpc in a @xmath16mpc box , we compute various properties of dark matter halos with mass @xmath0 at redshift @xmath1 . we find the following results .",
