    "evidence for a substantial particle dark matter component in our galaxy is by now quite convincing .",
    "the strength and nature of non - gravitational dm interactions with the standard model ( dm - sm interactions ) are unknown , but sensitivities of many currently operating experiments are at the level of predicted signals for many well - studied dm models .",
    "possibilities range in principle from just beyond current experimental bounds to levels that are impossible to probe directly , although the predominant weakly - interacting - massive - particle ( wimp ) dark matter paradigm naturally provides for the observed dm relic abundance , while predicting dm - sm interactions mediated via couplings of approximately weak interaction strength to mediators with approximately weak scale masses .",
    "as is well - known , wimp dm may be observed in three possible ways : ( @xmath4 ) directly , through it s interactions with nuclei ( and/or electrons ) in underground detectors , ( @xmath5 ) indirectly , through it s self - annihilation into standard model ( sm ) particles in space and , lastly , ( @xmath6 ) through it s production at colliders such as the lhc , appearing as an excess of missing transverse energy ( met ) .",
    "the study of wimp dm has been historically dominated by `` top - down '' studies based on new physics frameworks ( @xmath7 supersymmetry , extra dimensions , etc . )",
    "that are primarily meant to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "such theories naturally posit new particles with weak - interactions and masses not far from the weak scale and more or less automatically provide wimp dm candidates . in the current era",
    "much effort ( rightly ) continues to be devoted to such `` top - down '' studies ( @xmath7 , @xcite-@xcite ) , wherein the variety of phenomenology available in these frameworks can be studied in the context of fully - developed uv complete theories .    in quite an orthogonal direction a more `` bottom - up '' approach to studying dm - sm interactions has recently taken shape @xcite-@xcite . in the case where the dm particle is lighter than the degrees of freedom which mediate dm - sm interactions",
    "one can describe such interactions in an effective field theory ( eft ) framework . in this picture",
    "the sm particles and the dm particle are the only light degrees of freedom in the theory and dm - sm interactions are described in terms of contact operators . at any fixed naive scaling dimension",
    "there are a limited number of such operators that respect lorentz and gauge invariance so that , under the assumption that one particular operator in such a set is the dominant interaction channel , one can systematically derive bounds in a fairly model - independent fashion .",
    "this approach lends itself particularly nicely to studies of the complementarity of different classes of dm search experiments since , in the contact operator approximation , the very same coupling that dictates dm elastic scattering is , to some extent , also that which dictates dm pair production at colliders and that which determines the energetic products of dm annihilation in astrophysical dark matter halos",
    ". it may also be the case that different operators are dominant in the different classes of experiments ( @xmath7 , a dm - quark interaction may dominate elastic scattering while a dm - lepton interaction may provide the dominant dm annihilation channel ) . ] .",
    "this approach has been used to great effect in the works @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , in which it was shown that if the eft description holds , the irreducible collider signals provided by dm pair production with associated initial state radiation ( monojets ) can place bounds on dm interactions with colored sm particles that are competitive with dark matter direct detection experiments , especially for light ( @xmath8 ) dark matter .",
    "this approach has since been developed in many directions , @xmath7 , to include more general classes of operators @xcite@xcite@xcite and to include a wider variety of collider and dm searches @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the interactions between dark matter and the electroweak gauge bosons of the standard model .",
    "one reason to study this class of operators is simply that , ignorant as we are about dm - sm couplings , the most visible interactions ( dm interactions with colored sm particles ) may be suppressed relative to dm interactions with sm vector bosons . besides this",
    ", such interactions may also indicate the extent to which dm is related to electroweak symmetry breaking and the extent to which the wimp paradigm holds . in `` top - down '' models the wimp dm candidates are typically new partners of the electroweak gauge bosons ( such as the gauginos in susy and the kk photon of universal extra - dimensions models ) or even of the higgs sector particles themselves ( higgsinos in susy ) . as such this class of operators may provide information that is highly complementary to studies of wimp dark matter in the context of uv complete theories of dark matter .",
    "to begin we will describe our effective operator description of dm interactions with electroweak gauge bosons in detail ( section [ sec : operators ] ) , focusing on fermionic dm and considering operators of naive scaling dimension @xmath9 . to set bounds on dm interactions with electroweak gauge bosons we consider weak boson fusion ( wbf ) searches for production of dark matter in @xmath10 and @xmath11 lhc searches ( section [ sec : wbf ] ) .",
    "we then consider dm indirect - detection bounds that can be obtained from current observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies , monochromatic @xmath12-ray searches and from measurements of the cosmic - ray antiproton spectrum ( section [ sec : dm ] ) .",
    "finally we combine collider and indirect - detection limits and discuss our results . as will be seen below the combined reach of these searches",
    "is quite significant , @xmath13 tev , for a wide range of @xmath14 masses .",
    "the discussion presented here is related to the works @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in this section we first present a general discussion of the philosophy and structure of our eft model of dm interactions with electroweak gauge bosons , which leads us to a list of operators that will be the main focus of this paper ( table [ optable ] ) and their detailed description .",
    "we assume that the relevant light degrees of freedom include only the usual matter content of the sm and a dark matter particle @xmath14 . here",
    "we consider only dirac or majorana fermionic to refer to both the dm particle itself and to the multiplet containing the dm particle . when it is not clear from the context we further clarify using @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "] @xmath14 , though generalization to scalar @xmath14 s would be a straightforward extension of this analysis .",
    "we consider operators of naive scaling dimension @xmath9 coupling @xmath14 to the sm bosons @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath17 ( or equivalently @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , which we may generically refer to as @xmath20 . in general",
    "we have contact operators not only of the 4-point @xmath21 topology , but also operators which generate 3-point @xmath22 couplings to neutral gauge bosons , the latter of which ( as we will discuss at length in the following sections ) lead to substantial alterations to our phenomenological expectations .",
    "we require all operators to satisfy @xmath23 invariance , but not necessarily invariance under the unified electroweak @xmath24 .",
    "this allows for the possibility that our effective theory is uv completed by a theory which has already undergone electroweak symmetry breaking , so that operators such as the @xmath25 higgs portal @xcite-@xcite operator @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 can be @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) may be considered here . throughout this work",
    "we present bounds assuming dirac @xmath14 , as corresponding bounds for majorana @xmath14 differ only by the appropriate symmetry factors or vanish identically , as in the case of operators containing @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .    since we are not model - building uv complete dark sectors , but rather working in an effective operator approximation our assumptions about the electroweak charges and representations of the @xmath14 multiplet have little qualitative impact on our end results . nevertheless , it is conceptually helpful to discuss this here in some detail .",
    "dm must be the electrically neutral and stable component of some multiplet @xmath14 and may be either a sm singlet or non - singlet , except in the case of operators such as the `` magnetic moment , '' @xmath32 , which obviously require a @xmath14 transforming under @xmath24 . for multiplets having",
    "both charged and neutral components the charged states are generically heavier than the neutral component by @xmath33 due to loop corrections @xcite@xcite , although a full description of the uv theory would be necessary to actually calculate this splitting and to assure that @xmath15 is the lightest new particle .",
    "additional discrete symmetries ( @xmath7 , r - parity , t - parity , kk - parity , etc . )",
    "are typically posited to prevent @xmath15 from decaying into lighter sm states .",
    "non - singlet @xmath14 s may be in either chiral or non - chiral representations of @xmath24 .",
    "dm in chiral representations must get its mass , like the sm fermions , via the higgs mechanism and thus has a renormalizable coupling , @xmath34 , to the higgs .",
    "such a coupling is not considered in the current analysis and could significantly modify our results ( although models with additional chiral matter are highly constrained by precision observables ) .",
    "non - chiral @xmath14 s may be further classified as being in real or complex representations of @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) . for real representations @xmath35 , implying that the leading @xmath21 interactions are t - channel @xmath16 exchanges built out of vertices @xmath36 ( the canonical example being the susy wino ) .",
    "for complex representations @xmath14 has @xmath37 and thus couples to @xmath0 at tree - level , a coupling which badly violates dm direct detection bounds unless it is highly suppressed .",
    "this suppression is usually accomplished with two or more such multiplets , adding operators which mix gauge eigenstates with differing hypercharge such that the lightest neutral component hardly couples to the @xmath0 @xcite ( the canonical example being the susy higgsino ) . in the current work",
    "we try to remain agnostic as to the particular details of the dark sector and seek to present our bounds so that they can be interpreted in the context of any particular uv theory .",
    "while the eft formalism offers simplicity and model - independence , its disadvantage , relative to the study of fully - defined models , is that it is not generally applicable .",
    "the crux of this issue is that when experiments probe our contact operators with energies @xmath38 such that the sm and dm particle are no longer the only light degrees of freedom ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 for operators with dimensionful coefficient @xmath41 ) we expect our eft description to break down and the details of the uv theory to become important . for direct detection experiments looking for dm scattering , in which characteristic energies",
    "are @xmath42 , the effective theory should essentially always hold ( as evidenced by the typical @xmath43 mass splittings discussed above ) . for indirect detection experiments that look for the annihilation products of highly non - relativistic ( @xmath44 ) halo dm , in which characteristic energies are @xmath45 , the effective theory should hold as long as the mass of particles that mediate these interactions is @xmath46 , as we have basically assumed in stating that the sm and @xmath14 are the only light degrees of freedom .",
    "one caveat to this is in cases where the masses of new particles which mediate the interaction are @xmath47 ( `` light mediators '' ) .",
    "although the eft formalism may seem inappropriate in such a scenario , some studies have investigated taking this approach @xcite@xcite@xcite . for collider experiments",
    "the efficacy of the operator formalism is not as automatic . in probing these operators via weak boson fusion at the lhc",
    "we expect energies on the order of the partonic cm energy @xmath48 .",
    "strictly speaking then , bounds that are set in wbf searches must translate to bounds on mediator masses in excess of the average partonic cm energy in order to be interesting in this context .",
    "it is interesting to try and determine which portions of the @xmath1 vs.  @xmath49 plane can not have a perturbative uv completion .",
    "this has been done in previous works , for example those studying @xmath50 interactions , by identifying the dimensionful coefficient of these operators with the couplings and mass of an imagined heavy mediator exchange , @xmath51 , imposing @xmath46 and @xmath52 , thus defining a perturbativity boundary in the @xmath1 vs.  @xmath49 plane .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated in the case of @xmath53 interactions .",
    "consider , for example , the higgs portal operator @xmath26 , which is a @xmath25 operator with coefficient @xmath54 .",
    "if one imagines that the corresponding uv completion involves an s - channel exchange of some new heavy scalar particle @xmath55 then the new vertex @xmath56 in the uv theory is dimensionful , having a coefficient @xmath57 that may be associated to the electroweak vev @xmath58 , but could just as well involve dimensionful numbers generated via the details of the dark sector physics . similarly , the coefficient of the @xmath59 operator @xmath60 is ambiguously connected to the parameters of the underlying uv physics , as such an operator typically describes a process that happens at loop level , having cross - sections which are complicated functions of the couplings and masses of particles in the loop ( @xmath7 , @xmath61 in the mssm ) .",
    "given such complications we omit further discussion of uv perturbativity in this work .",
    "in any given uv theory this boundary can be straightforwardly computed and compared to the exclusion limits that will be presented below .",
    "unitarity offers a uv-_insensitive _ criterion for determining the efficacy of our eft description of wbf events at the lhc @xcite . as is familiar from",
    ", @xmath7 , pion scattering , amplitudes in a low - energy effective description may violate s - matrix unitarity as the energy of these interactions is increased .",
    "conversely , at any given energy of interest we may typically consider increasing @xmath1 so that , above some value , our effective description would not violate unitarity for interactions at this energy . for @xmath1 below this value",
    "the apparent violation of unitarity signals the failure of our eft description and suggests that some modification would be necessary ( @xmath39 , a proliferation of operators or the detailed dynamics of a particular uv completion ) to correctly describe the physics . for events at the lhc we have the further complication that the energy flowing through our operator",
    "is distributed according to pdfs and kinematics .",
    "the most stringent use of unitarity on our eft description would be to consider the worst case scenario , imagining the full machine center - of - mass energy flowing through our operator in order to set our `` unitarity bound '' in for which we can consider using our eft . ]",
    "the @xmath1 vs.  @xmath49 plane .",
    "typical wbf events , however , would have much less energy flowing through our operator because of pdf supression .",
    "we could then simulate events , calculating the energy flow through our operator in each , and derive contours in the @xmath1 vs.  @xmath49 plane such that , say , 99% of events do not violate unitarity .",
    "the interpretation of this is that most of the events that we include in our calculation of the experimental bound are well - described by our eft language , only a small fraction are not ( in an actual experiment these events might result in the production of particles that mediate this interaction and thus may not even look like wbf events ) so the bound we derive should be fairly accurate .",
    "in what follows we will display contours for which 99% , 90% and 50% of events signal acceptance . ]",
    "appear not to violate unitarity in @xmath10 and @xmath11 wbf events .",
    "finally , while we will focus entirely on dm interactions with gauge bosons in this work , it is sensible to ask how the inclusion of the higgs boson would affect our results . with sm singlet or vector - like dm , as is our focus , there is no possibility for renormalizable interactions coupling the @xmath14 to the higgs before electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , all combinations @xmath62 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    ", are sm singlets and can be joined to operators like @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 giving non - renormalizable interactions between the @xmath14 and the higgs .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking these operators lead to , @xmath7 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath22 and @xmath21 interactions , the former two of which we are not considering in focusing on only operators of the form @xmath22 or @xmath21 .",
    "there are two main consequences of omitting 3-point and 4-point operators with higgses : in leaving out @xmath66 interactions we will not have spin - independent scattering via the higgs at tree level in our eft , and in leaving out @xmath67 interactions we will not be able to quote gamma - ray line bounds for the @xmath68 final state .",
    "operators of the form @xmath22 or @xmath21 arising from higgses in the lagrangian do not change our analysis qualitatively , but result in re - interpretations of these results . taking @xmath69 for example ,",
    "gives a @xmath66 coupling that ( after integrating out the higgs ) would simply return what we are calling the higgs portal operator : @xmath26 .",
    "can this scenario be discerned from one in which some other ( heavier ) scalar mediates this interaction ? at lhc energies , strictly speaking , the light higgs can not be integrated out , as it will actually be produced on - shell , but ( as is usually done in light mediator analyses ) one could use the narrow width approximation in order to derive collider bounds on @xmath26 in either case . in considering direct detection bounds ,",
    "the coupling to the light higgs @xmath66 could give significantly larger spin - independent scattering rates at a given @xmath1 as compared to an interaction mediated by a heavy particle that does not couple to fermions directly at that same @xmath1 ( @xmath39 , @xmath26 is the _ only _ interaction in the eft ) . despite these being conceptually distinct scenarios ,",
    "they likely can not be distinguished in direct detection experiments and bounds on each are simply different interpretations of the same data .",
    "combinations like @xmath65 and @xmath70 also return @xmath22 and @xmath21 interactions that , in the end , yield operators that we are already considering , @xmath7 , @xmath71   \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ \\upsilon \\end{array } \\right ) \\quad \\sim z^{0\\mu}.\\\\ \\label{dhiggs }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      .table describing operators used in this work .",

    "the @xmath25 operators d5a - b could result from exchanges mediated by new heavy scalar or pseudoscalar bosons .",
    "these operators necessarily require spontaneous breaking of @xmath24 down to @xmath23 and consequently only the @xmath28 and @xmath29 subprocesses are allowed for these operators .",
    "the @xmath25 operators d5c - d are similar to dark magnetic and electric dipole moments , the operator d5d is equivalent to an operator of the form @xmath72 . ] ( respectively ) , which have been the subject of much recent study @xcite-@xcite . as these operators have one field strength @xmath73 , they give rise to both 4-point @xmath21 and 3-point @xmath22 contact interactions .",
    "since we are talking about interactions involving two _ neutral _ dm particles , the @xmath73 in the d5c - d operators can be either @xmath74 or @xmath75 , giving specifically the subprocesses : @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 operators d6a - b @xcite could arise via exchange of new neutral vector bosons ( @xmath7 , a @xmath80 ) and , since @xmath81 or @xmath75 , give rise to the same 4-point and 3-point interactions as in the d5c - d case .",
    "finally , the @xmath59 operators d7a - d typically arise from 1-loop diagrams ( @xmath7 , the @xmath82 process in susy ) , and may occur through any of the @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 subprocesses .",
    "the operator expressions listed in table [ optable ] should all be understood as the sum of the expression listed and its complex conjugate expression .",
    "we employ canonical normalizations listed in the `` norm .",
    "'' column of the table .    in the `` vertices '' column we distinguish operators that have _ only _ 4-point interactions , from operators that have _ both _ 3-point and 4-point interactions .",
    "this is distinction is very important , as we will describe in the following sections , for both the lhc wbf bounds and for direct detection bounds . for wbf ,",
    "operators with both 3- and 4-point interactions tend to generate events which look more like the background @xmath85 processes than otherwise , and thus are somewhat harder to constrain at the lhc . as concerns direct detection , operators with only 4-point interactions must scatter via higher - order processes and current bounds have been estimated to be somewhat far from current experimental sensitivities @xcite@xcite@xcite , while operators with both 3- and 4-point interactions may scatter off of nuclei via tree - level exchanges of the @xmath0 or the @xmath86 .",
    "since we know that dark matter is _ dark _ and approximately collisionless , the 3-point coupling @xmath78 , and resulting long - range interaction , is highly constrained by an array of measurements @xcite that are sensitive to both dm - sm interactions and to dm - dm self - interactions .",
    "the direct detection phenomenology of the @xmath78 scenario diverges from that which is usually studied , as the recoil spectrum derived for such a long - range interaction is distinct from the recoil spectra derived for the typically assumed @xmath87 ( si ) and @xmath88 ( sd ) interactions , and has been the subject of recent developments @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "given that such a scenario is so tightly constrained we will suppose that the @xmath78 interaction is negligible in setting our bounds , @xmath7 , by tuning lagrangian terms involving the @xmath89 and @xmath90 fields to cancel this vertex .",
    "the only opportunity for appreciable scattering rates is thus the @xmath77 vertex . for our operators , however",
    ", these vertices always involve derivatives and are thus momentum suppressed and always result in negligible scattering .",
    "for @xmath2 the @xmath77 vertex will allow the decay @xmath91 , contributing to the invisible width of the @xmath0 , which is measured to be @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the constraint from this bound will be shown in the figures that follow .    the entries in the `` sub - procs . ''",
    "column refer to the allowed combinations of gauge bosons ( @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath93 and @xmath84 - `` _ _ subprocesses _ _ '' ) that can arise from the generic @xmath94 and @xmath73 in each operator .",
    "available subprocesses are determined simply by @xmath23 invariance , as vertices need to conserve electric charge and photons are only allowed to arise from the field strength @xmath95 .",
    "any uv complete theory will specify the exact weighted combination of subprocesses present in the eft , but here we will need to make some assumption about these combinations in order to proceed . as is discussed in the following sections this assumption is more subtle in the context of wbf , where the gauge bosons are intermediate state particles and different subprocess combinations correspond to different _ coherent _ sums .",
    "one may also expect that custodial symmetry @xcite@xcite is an important constraint on the allowed subprocess combinations .",
    "we will not consider this in further detail , except to say that corrections ( @xmath7 , to gauge boson masses ) are suppressed both by the appropriate power of the high scale @xmath1 and also by an additional loop factor , so that combinations which deviate from the custodial limit are not obviously ruled out . in the end",
    "it is likely necessary that corrections to electroweak precision observables need to be calculated in the complete uv theory .",
    "the column labeled `` ann . '' lists the leading order terms in the non - relativistic expansion of the analytic calculation of dm annihilation . for operators d5d and d6b this",
    "is quoted in terms of annihilations to either the @xmath27 or @xmath96 final states , as they have different leading order terms in their expansions .",
    "we will obviously expect that operators with leading order terms @xmath97 will be significantly more difficult to constrain via indirect detection searches than those with leading order terms @xmath98 .    finally ,",
    "while not shown on the table , we note that the various operators have various p and cp properties .",
    "while parity violation in the dark sector is unconstrained ( and possibly motivated by the observed parity violation in the sm ) , cp violation in the dark sector is possibly constrained via the cp violation that could be induced in the sm via higher - order interactions with dm in loops .",
    "such constraints are expected to be highly model - dependent and are thus beyond the scope of this work .",
    "weak boson fusion ( wbf ) processes have been widely studied as a means of enhancing lhc searches for the higgs boson and such searches have been shown to be an effective strategy for discovering invisibly decaying higgs bosons at the @xmath11 lhc ] . here",
    "we will use this same type of analysis , not for studying the higgs , but for setting bounds on our contact operators .",
    "one could also imagine using searches for a single electroweak vector boson recoiling off of missing transverse momentum , as has been discussed in the context of searches for an invisibly decaying higgs in , @xmath7 , @xcite .",
    "here we focus only on wbf , as the enhanced production through longitudinally polarized gauge bosons has the potential for further reach than otherwise . for operators that favor transversely polarized gauge bosons",
    ", however , we expect that such `` mono - v '' searches would complement the results derived here .",
    "wbf signal events are characterized by the presence of two very energetic and well - separated forward / backward jets , as well as large missing transverse momentum . here",
    "we derive bounds on our operators from wbf searches analyses of ( current ) @xmath10 @xmath99 and ( future ) @xmath11 @xmath100 lhc data sets .",
    "this section is divided up into three parts : first we discussed the application of the contact operator approach in the context of wbf searches , next we discuss the details of our wbf analysis in detail , and finally we present the resulting bounds on our contact operators .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , employing our eft description in the collider environment is much subtler than an eft description of direct and indirect dark matter searches .",
    "the first issue that we need to address is the treatment of _ subprocesses _ in our wbf analysis .",
    "generic uv completions of our eft will result in non - trivial _ combinations _ of contact interactions connecting the dm particle @xmath14 to the gauge boson pairs @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath93 and @xmath84 ( _ subprocesses _ ) . for indirect detection searches different combinations of _ final _ state gauge bosons will simply result in a different combinations of exclusion limits from the various dm searches . in a wbf search however , the gauge bosons are _ intermediate state _ particles , and in principle the different subprocesses add coherently .",
    "here we have dealt with this difficulty as follows .    in a particular uv theory",
    "one can explicitly calculate the coefficients that relate these different subprocesses , which we denote schematically as : @xmath101 if only one of these @xmath102 s is non - zero then we can obtain the exact bound by doing a collider simulation and calculating a cross - section for that particular subprocess operator in isolation is a reminder that these @xmath103 s are dependent on the machine center of mass energy and also on the cuts employed in the analysis .",
    "] , @xmath104 what we will do for this analysis is to simply present limits based on these individual subprocesses , and to estimate the limit on an operator involving a sum of sub - processes by the weighted _ incoherent _ sum of these limits : @xmath105 of course , there should in principle be constructive or destructive _ interference _ amongst the amplitudes for different subprocesses , resulting in larger or smaller total cross - sections .",
    "it is clear that the procedure described above can not account for this , however we find that the error incurred in employing this approximation is typically small compared to the other sources of error ( @xmath7 , systematic uncertainties ) present in the estimation of the bound .    to give a concrete example , suppose that the operator d7a is the relevant wbf operator resulting from integrating out the heavy fields in some particular uv theory .",
    "we then assume that the @xmath106 and @xmath107 fields @xmath108 and @xmath75 appear with relative weights @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in this case",
    "the momentum space feynman rules ( `` f.r . ''",
    "below ) derived in the mass - eigenstate basis are : @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the momenta and lorentz indices of gauge bosons , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the sine and cosine of the weinberg angle , and @xmath118 . here",
    "we define the @xmath119 s by taking the squared prefactors from the above equation ( we actually generate the cross - sections @xmath120 using @xmath121 , as is explained in section [ signalwbf ] ) : @xmath122 thus we compute @xmath123 for this operator as : @xmath124 we will explore the bounds obtained for the example given above in further detail in section [ signalwbf ] ( after we describe our numerical analysis in detail ) , where we will pay particular attention to the influence of interference ( or lack thereof ) and systematic uncertainties on these results .",
    "there are several classes of important backgrounds to our signal , which are illustrated in figure [ figs : bgfeyn ] .",

    ", the pure qcd component can be substantially suppressed by cutting on @xmath129 , so we simply omit these events from our background simulation ( this was also found for the 3j simulations performed in the work @xcite ) .",
    "background , similar diagrams are found for @xmath126 background as well.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    this analysis is carried out at the parton level , following the analysis presented in @xcite as closely as possible .",
    "an important difference between the two analyses is that , in the work @xcite , the authors used various calculational tools to simulate the various classes of events , while our analysis makes exclusive use of the madgraph v.5 @xcite package for all sm backgrounds , as well as for the signal events arising from the operators described above . while these differences are reflected in the cross - section limits derived in the two analyses we observe that these discrepancies do not have a qualitative impact on setting limits on the high mass scale , @xmath1 .    here",
    "we describe the most relevant cuts that have been applied in our analysis and discuss their effects on the various background and signal components .",
