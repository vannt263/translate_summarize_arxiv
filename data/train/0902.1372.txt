    "over past decades , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has become an important platform to demonstrate quantum characteristics of atoms and photons @xcite . some remarkable experiments , such as strong coupling of the trapped atoms with cavity @xcite , conditional logic gating @xcite , efficient generation of single photons single , singlephoton and",
    "so on have been performed successfully .    with atoms strongly interacting with the local cavity mode as quantum nodes and the photons flying between different nodes as quantum bus",
    ", we may set up a quantum network , which has been considered as a promising way to scaling of the qubit system for large - scale quantum information processing .",
    "many theoretical @xcite and experimental works interf , beu have been done in this direction and some advances have been achieved over recent years . among the theoretical work mentioned above , the single photon experiencing input - output process of a cavity duan04,feng is of particular interests , in which the atomic qubits could be entangled by a single moving photon and the successful implementation is monitored by a click of the detector .",
    "the present paper will focus on the input - output process regarding optical cavities .",
    "motivated by a very recent experiment with microtoroidal resonator ( mtr ) @xcite , we intend to carry out some quantum information processing ( qip ) tasks by means of the input - output process relevant to optical cavities with low - q factors .",
    "we have noticed that the proposals duan04,feng required the cavities to be with high quality and with strong coupling to the confined atoms , otherwise the schemes would not work well or would be pretty inefficient .",
    "some simulation has been done to check how well the cavity input - output process works @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the gating time should be much shorter than the decay time of the cavity if we expect to have the gating with high success probability @xcite .",
    "evidently , it is not an easy experimental task to meet those requirements because the efficient output of photons , to some extent , implies the larger cavity decay rate , i.e. , the cavity with a relatively lower q factor . in this sense , the recent achievement of the mtr gives us hopes to solve the problem .",
    "although it is still of large decay rate ( i.e. , called ` bad ' cavity in @xcite ) and moderate coupling to the atom , the mtr , with individual photons input and output through a microresonator , has explicitly shown the effect of the photon blockade .",
    "so this mrt seems a promising candidate setup to be meeting the requirements in those qip schemes @xcite .",
    "our present work will , however , show the possibility of accomplishing some interesting qip tasks with the currently achieved mtr .",
    "the key step is to design a scheme for entangling two atoms confined respectively in two spatially separate cavities with low - q factors .",
    "so our work is actually not only relevant to the mtr , but also related to any single - sided optical cavities with one wall perfectly reflective but the other partially reflective @xcite . as a result",
    ", the mtr and the single - sided optical cavity will be mentioned alternately in what follows .",
    "we will first present an analytical expression for the reflection rate of the input - output process , which works for a wide range of parametric variation , from weak to strong coupling regimes , and in the presence or absence of the confined atom .",
    "then we will try to use a single photon to entangle two atoms confined respectively in two spatially separate cavities , based on which further qip tasks could be carried out .",
    "we argue that qip with single photons is an efficient way in the low - q cavity situation , which is considerably different from the high - q cavity and strong - coupling cases .",
    "different from the previous schemes @xcite with photonic polarization unchanged or changed by a phase @xmath0 , the large cavity decay and moderate coupling in our case lead to a certain angle rotation of the photonic polarization after the input - output process , which is called faraday rotation .",
    "the faraday rotation was originally studied in a resonant medium with zeeman level splitting under the radiation of linearly polarized light @xcite and has been recently observed experimentally in cold atom and quantum dot systems @xcite . the key point for the faraday rotation is the bi - refringent propagation of the light through the medium . by using the values from @xcite , we will show the desired faraday rotation for our purpose can be obtained in a two - mode cavity by using single photons with suitable frequencies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a general input - output relation for a single photon with respect to a low - q optical cavity confining a single atom under jaynes - cummings model .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "iii the faraday rotation in a two - mode cavity holding a three - level atom by @xmath1-type configuration .",
    "based on the faraday rotation , we may entangle remote atoms by a single photon , as shown in sec .",
    "v is devoted to the application of the generated entanglement .",
    "finally , we end with some discussion and a summary in sec .",
    "in this section , we present the basic input - output relation for a cavity coherently interacting with a trapped two - level atom . under the jaynes - cummings model , we have the following hamiltonian , @xmath2where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity field with frequency @xmath5 , respectively ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are , respectively , inversion , raising , and lowering operators of the two - level atom with frequency difference @xmath9 between the two levels .",
    "consider a single - photon pulse with frequency @xmath10 input in an optical cavity .",
    "the pulse can be expressed by @xmath11 @xcite , where @xmath12 is the normalized pulse shape as a function of @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the pulse duration , @xmath15 , a one - dimensional field operator , is the cavity input operator satisfying the commutation relation @xmath16=\\delta ( t - t^{\\prime } ) $ ] , and we denote the vacuum of all the optical modes by @xmath17 . in the rotating frame with respect to the frequency of the input pulse , the quantum langevin equation of the cavity mode @xmath3 driven by the corresponding cavity input operator",
    "@xmath18 is @xcite@xmath19a(t)-g\\sigma _ { -}(t)-\\sqrt{\\kappa }",
    "a_{\\mathrm{in}}(t ) ,   \\label{eom}\\]]where @xmath20 is the cavity damping rate .",
    "moreover , the atomic lowering operator also obeys a similar equation and , in the rotating frame of the frequency @xmath10 , we have , @xmath21\\sigma _ { -}(t)-g\\sigma _ { z}(t)a(t)+\\sqrt{\\gamma } \\sigma _ { z}(t)b_{\\mathrm{in% } } ( t ) ,   \\label{eom2}\\]]where @xmath22 , with the commutation relation @xmath23=\\delta ( t - t^{\\prime } ) $ ] , is the vacuum input field felt by the two - level atom , @xmath24 is the decay rate of the two - level atom .",
    "the input and output fields of the cavity are related by the intracavity field as @xcite @xmath25now assuming a large enough @xmath26 to make sure that we have a weak excitation by the single - photon pulse on the atom initially prepared in the ground state , i.e. , keeping @xmath27 throughout our operation , we can adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode and arrive at the input - output relation of the cavity field,@xmath28[i(\\omega _ { 0}-\\omega _ { \\mathrm{p}})+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}]+g^{2}}{% [ i(\\omega _ { c}-\\omega _ { \\mathrm{p}})+\\frac{\\kappa } { 2}][i(\\omega _ { 0}-\\omega _ { \\mathrm{p}})+\\frac{\\gamma } { 2}]+g^{2 } } ,   \\label{rela}\\]]where @xmath29 is the reflection coefficient for the atom - cavity system , and we have assumed in eq .",
    "( 5 ) that the input field of the two - level atom , @xmath30 , as a vacuum field , gives negligible contribution to the output cavity field @xmath31 .",
    "( [ rela ] ) is a general expression for various cases .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath32 , eq . ( 5 )",
    "can recover the previous result for an empty cavity @xcite , @xmath33 eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) also fits very well the results in @xcite : if @xmath34 is dominant with respect to other parameters , @xmath35 would be 1 , implying that the input photon remains unchanged when it is output . using the models in @xcite",
    ", we could explain the dominant @xmath34 case as that , due to the strong resonant coupling between the cavity field and the atom , the energy levels of the cavity will be shifted by the large vacuum rabi splitting , yielding a large detuning between the dressed - cavity - mode and the single photon which is of the same frequency as that of the original cavity . equivalently the total system can be seen as a photonic pulse interacting with a far - detuned bare cavity . as a result of eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) we have the reflective coefficient being 1 .",
    "this implies that the photon enters and then leaks out of the cavity without being absorbed by the cavity mode .",
    "in contrast , in the case that the cavity mode is far - detuned with respect to the confined atom , no level shift would occur in the cavity .",
    "since the single photon is of the same frequency as that of the cavity , we can equivalently see the model as the photon interacting resonantly with a bare cavity , which yields @xmath36 from eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( 5 ) the large detuning between the cavity mode and the atom means @xmath32 . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath37 . in this sense",
    ", we may argue that the controlled phase flip designed in @xcite seems a special case of eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) .",
    "in fact , the key condition for eq .",
    "( 5 ) is @xmath27 .",
    "so as long as @xmath26 is large enough , which makes @xmath38 always satisfied , eq .",
    "( 5 ) should work well even if @xmath34 is bigger than @xmath26 . as this condition was met in @xcite , it is not strange that we could apply eq .",
    "( 5 ) to some physics in @xcite . for more general cases , we plot fig .",
    "[ r ] by eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the values from @xcite for the absolute value and the phase shift of the reflection coefficient .",
    "in the case of an empty cavity , the pulse will experience a perfect reflection in the whole frequency regime , i.e. @xmath39 . the phase shift is @xmath40 at @xmath41 , but reduces to zero rapidly with the frequency of the input pulse deviating from the resonant point . in the case of an atom presented in the cavity",
    ", the coupling between the cavity field and the atom will shift the cavity mode , which leads to the vacuum splitting .",
    "such a splitting also makes the reflection coefficient a corresponding splitting , as shown in the absolute value and the phase shift of the reflective coefficient in fig .",
    "so it is the interaction between the cavity field and the atom that induces weak absorption of the photon with detuned frequency by the cavity mode and also decreases the reflection rate @xmath42 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ r ] , even for a bad cavity with strong damping , the decrease of the reflection rate is very small so that we can still have @xmath43 .",
    "in the preceding section , we did not consider the polarization degrees of freedom of the single photon . in this section ,",
    "we show that , with the general input - output relation , we can obtain a rotation regarding the polarization of the single photon pulse after the input - output process , known as the faraday rotation @xcite .    to explain the mechanism of faraday rotation in cavity - qed , we may consider the atom with the level structure as in fig .",
    "[ level1 ] .",
    "the states @xmath44 is the excited state .",
    "we assume that the transitions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are due to the coupling to two degenerate cavity modes @xmath47 and @xmath48 with left ( ) and right ( ) circular polarization , respectively .",
    "if the atom is initially prepared in @xmath49 ,  the only possible transition is @xmath50 will take action .",
    "so from eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) we have the output pulse related to the input one as @xmath51 with @xmath52 the corresponding phase shift determined by the parameter values .",
    "it also means that an input circularly polarized single - photon pulse @xmath53 would only sense the empty cavity . as a result , the corresponding output governed by eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) is @xmath54 with @xmath55 a phase shift different from @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , for an input linearly polarized photon pulse @xmath57 , the output pulse is @xmath58the polarization degrees of freedom of a linearly polarized optical field can be characterized by the stokes vector @xmath59 with @xcite,@xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) with @xmath63 or @xmath64 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator regarding different polarization .",
    "it is easily verified that @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 and eq .",
    "( 7 ) could be rewritten as @xmath67 , for which we define @xmath68 to be faraday rotation .    similarly , if the atom is initially prepared in @xmath69 , then only the @xmath70 circularly polarized photon could sense the atom , whereas the @xmath71 circularly polarized photon only interacts with the empty cavity .",
    "so we have , @xmath72 where the faraday rotation is @xmath73 .",
    "using the faraday rotation introduced in last section , we could generate entanglement between the atoms in spatially separate cavities with low - q factors , as plotted in fig .",
    "we consider the level structure of each trapped atom as in fig .",
    "[ level](b ) , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) are the degenerate zeeman sublevels of a typical alkali atom with @xmath77 . as the atom is in resonance with the cavity modes , the possible cavity - mode - induced transitions are @xmath78 ( or @xmath79 ) by absorbing or emitting a ( or ) circularly polarized photon .",
    "the transitions @xmath80 ( @xmath76 ) can be realized by a classical laser pulse . to entangle two atoms confined in spatially separate locations , we encode the qubits in @xmath81 and @xmath82 . as shown in fig .",
    "level(a ) , we input a single photon pulse in superposition of horizontal and vertical polarizations , i.e. , @xmath83 ( which changes to @xmath84 after going through the quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) ) into the first cavity , and then we direct the output pulse by a fiber to the second cavity .",
    "the detection of the output photon from the second cavity , assisted by a qwp and a hwp , would yield the atoms to be entangled .    specifically if the two atoms are prepared in @xmath85 with @xmath86 for different cavities , the photonic input and output regarding the first cavity yield , @xmath87which means an entanglement between the photonic and atomic qubits due to different faraday rotations .",

    "( [ rela ] ) with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and we have @xmath93 from eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) with @xmath94 .",

    ", we distinguish the states of the output pulse by the single - photon detector .",
    "therefore , we can generate the three - qubit entangled states in eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) at our will .",
    "evidently , the scheme can be generalized to the situation involving more atoms .",
    "in this section , we carry out some quantum information processing tasks using the generated atomic entanglement .",
    "the key integrant is the efficient conversion between the quantum nodes and the flying qubits .",
    "we will first show a conversion from the atomic entanglement to the photonic entanglement by some single qubit rotations on the atoms .",
    "then we transfer any unknown photonic state to the atom trapped in a distant cavity and transfer an unknown state from one atom to another .      supposing that the atoms in two separate cavities have been entangled as in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , we apply two @xmath115-polarized classical laser pulses simultaneously on the two atoms , and the states of the atoms change as , @xmath116 produce a @xmath70- ( or @xmath71- ) circularly polarized photon .",
    "( [ efp ] ) becomes @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 ) is the generated photonic state with @xmath71 ( or @xmath64 ) polarization from the @xmath119th cavity , and the photon will change the polarization to @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 ) after going through the qwp . in eqs .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , we have omitted the photonic states in vacuum for simplicity .",
    "the two equations above clearly show that the entanglement is converted from the atomic states to the states of the emitting photons , which is actually a source of entangled photons and will be used for further quantum information processing mission .",
    "our another scheme is to use the atomic entanglement generated above for state transfer from a photon to an atom in distance .",
    "suppose that the atoms have been prepared in a maximally entangled state @xmath122 . as we want to transfer an unknown photonic state @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) via the atomic entanglement from one side to another , the photon only needs to go through one of the cavities .",
    "first we input the single photon to the cavity in its local side ( for convenience , we call it as first cavity and the other one the second cavity ) , the state of the total system changes as , latexmath:[\\]]by detecting the photon polarization and the states of the first atom , the second atom would be projected onto four corresponding states with equal probability . after the local operations conditioned on the measurement results , the unknown state , i.e. ( @xmath133 ) , on the second atom is reconstructed .",
    "eq . ( 5 ) is the key result of the present paper , based on which we have made the schemes for entanglement generation and state transfer .",
    "it is easy to check that eq .",
    "( 5 ) fits very well the numerical results in @xcite . as an analytical expression working for a wide range of parametric values , eq .",
    "( 5 ) should be very useful in the study of cavity qed .    the entanglement generation and state transfer in sections iv and v are sketched for the low - q cavities , such as the achieved mtr @xcite or the single - sided cavity @xcite .",
    "one point we have to mention is that we have not yet figured out the controlled logic gate between the two distant atomic qubits based on the faraday rotation , although we could achieve entanglement in between .",
    "so we could not achieve teleportation between the two atoms from the conventional viewpoint @xcite .",
    "anyway we have shown the possibility to transfer an atomic or a photonic qubit state to a distant atomic qubit .",
    "different from the standard teleportation steps , we need local operations on the qubits on both sides as well as classical information to achieve the transfer of a quantum state .",
    "the entanglement of two distant atomic qubits by a single photon in our scheme is more efficient than that by interference of two photons emitted from two respective atoms @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the entanglement between the two atomic qubits relies on the two leaking photons reaching at the beam splitter simultaneously , as well as the high efficiency of the two detectors , which strongly restricts the success rate in real implementation .",
    "in contrast , as only a single photon is involved in our scheme , there is no requirement for simultaneous detection .",
    "so our scheme should be more efficient than those using two detectors in the case of the large inefficiency of current single - photon detector .",
    "the imperfection in our scheme is the photon loss , which is also a problem in previously published schemes with photon interference .",
    "the photon loss occurs due to the cavity mirror absorption and scattering , the fiber absorption , and the inefficiency of the detector .",
    "as the successful detection of the photon ensures the accomplishment of our implementation , the photon loss actually only affects the efficiency of the scheme , but not the fidelity of the entanglement generation . moreover , even if we implement the scheme with low success rate , due to the highly efficient single - photon source , such as 10,000 single photons per second @xcite , we are able to accomplish our schemes within a short time",
    ". we may simply assess the implementation of our schemes , where the failure rate due to atomic decay is about @xmath134 .",
    "moreover , the current dark count rate of the single - photon detector is about 100 hz , which can reduce the efficiency of our scheme by a factor of @xmath135",
    ". other imperfection rate , regarding the photon absorption by the fiber and the scattering of the cavity mirror , can be assumed to be 6@xmath136 .",
    "thus the success rate of our implementation should be @xmath137 , where the square is due to two atoms involved . by using the generation rate @xmath138 @xmath139 of single photons ,",
    "the two atoms can be entangled within 2 sec , provided that the two atoms are not very distant , i.e. , without considering the time of the photon traveling in between .",
    "evidently , our scheme is in principle scalable with the single photon going through the spatially separate cavities one by one .",
    "however , with more atoms ( confined in cavities ) involved , the photon loss would be more serious and thereby it will take a longer time for a successful event .    before ending the paper , we would like to reiterate the difference of our present work from the relevant work published previously @xcite .",
    "the previous schemes prefer to work in strong coupling condition , i.e. , @xmath140 .",
    "the fidelity of the operations decreases significantly with the decrease of @xmath141 .",
    "in contrast , our study focuses on the input - output process of the low - q cavity .",
    "we have not only analytically presented an important expression for the photonic reflection , which straightforwardly leads to our understanding of faraday rotation , but also demonstrated a way to entanglement generation and state transfer in the case of low - q cavity .",
    "we argue the impossibility of controlled -not gating in the case under our consideration , which is different from the strong - coupling or other cases considered in @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we have shown the preference with a single photon to carry out qip tasks .    in summary",
    ", the general reflection rate of input - output process we have analytically presented can be applied to different cases for cavity qed : with and without atoms confined , and with strong or weak coupling , and particularly useful for weak coupling case .",
    "based on this general reflection rate and a recently achieved mtr , we have proposed a scheme using cavities with low - q factors to entangle distant atoms by a single photon , to generate entangled photons , and to transfer quantum state to a distant qubit .",
    "we argue that our work would be useful for qip in cavity qed with current technology .",

    "so we prefer to call our operation state tranfer , instead of teleportation . on the other hand ,",
    "as bell - state measurement can be replaced by a controlled - not gate plus some single - qubit rotations and measurements , any conditional gate between any two qubits , e.g. , between a photonic qubit and an atomic qubit , would achieve a teleportation .",
    "but it seems unrealizable in our present treatment unless we assume @xmath143 as done in duan04,feng .",
    "we have also noticed the conditional phase gate in kimble95 with two input photons by using both faraday rotation and bi - photonic nonlinearity , which is beyond our model ."
