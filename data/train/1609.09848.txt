    "the glasma flux tube model for rhic@xcite central au - au collision at @xmath4 = 200.0 gev has an arrangement of surface flux tubes which are formed in the initial collision and conserve momentum between them .",
    "the tubes expand longitudinally and are pushed out radially .",
    "the higher @xmath2 particles come mainly from particle emission from the tubes .",
    "some arrangements of the tubes favor a large @xmath0 among the higher @xmath2 particles while other arrangements of the tubes favor a large @xmath1(see the top two figures of figure 1 . ) .",
    "the flux tube model of ref.@xcite approximate the soft particle of the hydro system with particle production given by ref.@xcite . in each central event",
    "we rotate the largest flux tube into the x axis as shown in figure 1 .",
    "each particle from the flux tube fragmentation is given a unique tag , where the largest flux tube has tag number 1 .",
    "next we adjust the momentum vector direction of some of the soft particles such that we achieve the flow pattern of the lower figure of figure 1 .",
    "we use a particle by particle one up the y axis and then one down the y axis .",
    "one flowing towards + @xmath5 and one flowing towards -@xmath5 . a @xmath6 particle of around twice the momentum is moved into place to conserve momentum .",
    "each of the @xmath7 and @xmath6 is given a tag .",
    "the flux tubes has a built in momentum conservation however we must make a final adjustment of the soft particles in order to conserve momentum in the x and y direction .",
    "this is done by simply scaling up or down the positive components of the soft particles this is a very small change because of the care used in imposing the squeeze out flow .",
    "we sum over many generated central event to make sure that the overall @xmath0 lies along the y axis , while the @xmath1 is pointed in the @xmath6 direction or the minus x axis .",
    "in the last section we created our simulation of squeeze out to have a global @xmath1 pointed in the minus x direction(see lower figure of figure 1 . ) . at low @xmath2 @xmath3",
    "will also point in this minus x direction .",
    "however as we move to higher @xmath2 the largest flux tube will take over and @xmath3 will switch to the positive x axis .",
    "we can capture this behavior through a two particle correlation with respect to the reaction plane(@xmath8 ) given by global @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath9    where @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 denote the azimuthal angles of the reaction plane , produced particle 1 , and produced particle 2 .",
    "this two particle azimuthal correlation measures the difference between the global @xmath1 and the @xmath2 dependent @xmath3 .",
    "if we would rotate all events such that @xmath8 = 0.0 , then we have",
    "@xmath12    we calculate this correlation over the simulated central events and obtain the values shown in figure 2 .",
    "where the @xmath2 is that of the second particle .",
    "this sign change moving from lower @xmath2 to higher @xmath2 is the shift of @xmath3 from aligned with global @xmath1 at lower @xmath2 to anti - aligned at higher @xmath2 .",

    "however as we move to higher @xmath2 the largest flux tube will take over and @xmath3 will switch to the positive x axis .",
    "however the global @xmath3 of the event is not so simple to understand .",
    "let us form a two particle correlation with respect to the reaction plane(@xmath8 ) given by global @xmath0 , and take the sum of global @xmath3 vs @xmath2 dependent @xmath3 ,    @xmath13    where @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 denote the azimuthal angles of the reaction plane , produced particle 1 , and produced particle 2 .",

    "this sign does not change moving from lower @xmath2 to higher @xmath2 , however there is a shift toward the positive .",
    "more insight on this will be seen in later sections .",
    "in our simulation the flux tubes and the squeeze out particles have unique tags thus making it possible to explore their contribution to the over all correlation function show in figure 2 .",
    "each of the @xmath2 bins of the correlation in figure 2 . has a normalization .",
    "if we retain this normalization and only use subsets of particle pairs , we achieve the same correlation function when we add up all the different pair correlations . for this section",
    "we will consider one particle coming from the flux tubes with another coming from the squeeze out particles .",
    "this sub correlation function is shown in figure 4 .",
    "if we consider all the other pairs of particles leaving out the above pairs between the flux tubes and the squeeze out particles we arrive at the correlation of figure 5 .",

    "the largest flux tube has a special tag(tag 1 ) . in figure 6 .",
    "we plot the correlation of all tag 1 particles(largest flux tube ) with the squeeze out particles .",
    "we see that in this correlation the @xmath1 of the squeeze out particles are pointing in the @xmath6 direction the same as the global @xmath1 , while the largest flux tube @xmath3 points in the @xmath15 direction(see figure 1 . ) . with increasing @xmath2",
    "this correlation becomes stronger and stronger , because there is an increase in higher @xmath2 particles coming from the strongest flux tube .",
    "the other flux tubes on the surface conserve the momentum of the strongest flux tube thus generate a @xmath3 along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "this makes the squeeze out @xmath1(same as the global @xmath1 ) point in the same direction generating a negative correlation between the particles of the other flux tubes and the squeeze out particles .",
    "this correlation is shown in figure 7 . and is very constant in @xmath2 because the other flux tube particles are more spread out in @xmath2 .",
    "we will explore the same two major correlations of the last section since these correlation gave us insight into the overall correlations in the squeeze out system .",
    "we will use the same unique tags thus making it possible to fallow the @xmath3 in @xmath2 with respect to the global @xmath3 and explore their contribution to the over all correlation function show in figure 3 . as we did in the last section we will consider one particle coming from the flux tubes with another coming from the squeeze out particles .",
    "this sub correlation function is shown in figure 8 .",
    "this correlation shows a negative and quit flat correlation of momentum conservation between the flux tubes and the squeeze out particles .    if we consider all the other pairs of particles leaving out the above pairs between the flux tubes and the squeeze out particles we arrive at the correlation of figure 9 .",
    "we see that all the other pairs except those between the flux tubes and the squeeze out particles seem to be aligned with a positive correlation acting together to conserve momentum of the flux tube and squeeze out system .",
    "the largest flux tube has a special tag(tag 1 ) . in figure 10 .",
    "we plot the correlation of all tag 1 particles(largest flux tube ) with the squeeze out particles .",
    "we see that the large flux tube and the squeeze out particles have a negative correlation from momentum conservation .",
    "the other flux tubes on the surface conserve the momentum of the strongest flux tube thus generate a @xmath3 along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "this makes the squeeze out @xmath3 which is also pointing in the @xmath6 direction be aligned at high @xmath2 thus drives a positive correlation .",
    "however as a whole the flux tube system forms a momentum conserving system .",
    "the softer particles of the other flux tubes are a part of this system and have the momentum direction of the system which generates a negative correlation between the squeeze out particles and flux tubes(see figure 11 . ) .",
    "the flux tube model does well in describing a central au - au collision at rhic@xcite .",
