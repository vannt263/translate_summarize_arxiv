    "my aim with this paper is to use the local , _ fossil evidence _ ( i.e. the global metallicity and stellar ages at @xmath8 ) to get clues and set constraints on the past metal production and star formation rate ( sfr ) in the universe .",
    "this attempt ( see also rich 1997 ) is therefore complementary to current efforts to add more and more accurate data points to the global sfr vs redshift diagram ( the madau diagram , for short ; madau et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; madau , these proceedings ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the current evidence for the chemical composition of local clusters of galaxies , at low redshift .",
    "section 3 discusses to which extent clusters are representative of the low redshift universe as a whole . in section 4 a plea",
    "is presented for the bulk of stars in galactic spheroids ( i.e. ellipticals and bulges alike ) being very old , formed at high redshift , hence for a fair fraction of the metals we see at @xmath8 having been produced at high @xmath1 .",
    "i will conclude that this scenario favors high sfrs at high-@xmath1 , with the sfr peaking at @xmath9 .",
    "some of these topics are expanded upon in renzini ( 1997 , hereafter r97 ) .",
    "theoretical simulations predict that the baryon fraction of clusters can not change appreciably in the course of their evolution ( white et al .",
    "this is to say that  unlike individual galaxies  clusters are good examples of a",
    "_ closed box_. metals are ejected by galaxies but retained by clusters . moreover , as the baryon fraction remains nearly constant no extra - dilution of metals takes place , and eventually we find confined in the same place all the dark matter , all the baryons , all the galaxies , and all the metals that have participated in the play .",
    "hence , clusters are good _ archives _ of their past star formation and metal production history ( cavaliere , private communication ) .    metals in clusters are partly spread through their intracluster medium ( icm ) , partly locked into galaxies and stars . by comparison",
    ", the mass of metals ism of galaxies is negligible .",
    "icm abundances can be obtained from x - ray observations , while optical observations combined to population synthesis models provide estimates for the metallicity of the stellar component of galaxies .",
    "the best known icm abundance is that of iron .",
    "it comes from the so - called iron - k emission complex at @xmath11 kev , prominent in the x - ray spectrum of clusters .",
    "1 shows the iron abundance of clusters and groups as a function of icm temperature .",
    "still as a function of icm temperature , fig .",
    "2 shows instead the iron - mass - to - ligh - ratio ( ) of the cluster icm , measured as the ratio @xmath12 of the total iron mass in the icm over the total @xmath13-band luminosity of the galaxies in the cluster .    -5truecm",
    "-1truecm    the drop of the derived  in poor clusters and groups ( i.e. for @xmath14 kev ) can be traced back to a drop in both factors entering in its definition , i.e. , in the iron abundance _ and _ in the icm mass to light ratio .",
    "it is not clear whether this is a real effect , signalling that groups are not closed boxes , or that diagnostic problems are present due to iron being derived from the iron - l instead than from the iron - k complex ( cf .",
    "i will not further discuss of @xmath14 kev objects .",
    "what emerges from fig .",
    "1 and 2 is that both the iron abundance and the  in rich clusters ( @xmath15 kev ) are constant , i.e. independent of cluster temperature , hence of cluster richness and optical luminosity that are correlated quantities . in practice , @xmath16 solar , and @xmath17 .",
    "the simplest interpretation of all this is that clusters did not lose iron ( hence baryons ) , nor acquired pristine baryonic material , and that the conversion of baryonic gas to stars and galaxies has proceeded with the same efficiency and stellar imf in all clusters ( cf .",
    "the theoretical predictions on the baryon fraction in clusters ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) find a nice support from these evidences .    besides iron ,",
    "x - ray observations allow to measure the abundance of other elements in the icm , especially of the @xmath10-elements such as o , ne , mg , and si , with _",
    "asca _ having superceded any previous attempt in this respect . a fairly high @xmath10-element enhancement , with @xmath18/fe]@xmath19 , was initially reported ( mushotzky 1994 ) , but more recently mushotzky et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have revised down to @xmath18/fe]@xmath20 this estimate ( taking a global average for o , ne , mg , si , and fe ) .",
    "this may still suggest a modest @xmath10-element enhancement , with the icm enrichment being dominated by snii products .",
    "however , ishimaru & arimoto ( 1997 ) have recently pointed out that the small apparent @xmath10-element enhancement in the icm comes from mushotzky et al .",
    "( 1996 ) having assumed reference solar abundances from `` photospheric '' model atmosphere analysis .",
    "the result is different if one uses the `` meteoritic '' iron abundance instead , which is @xmath21 dex lower than the photospheric value . since the meteoritic value is now generally adopted for the solar iron abundance",
    ", one can conclude that there is virtually no @xmath10-element enhancement at all in the icm ( formally @xmath18/fe]@xmath22 ) .",
    "it is eventually quite reassuring to find that clusters of galaxies are _ solar _ as far as the elemental ratios are concerned , which argues for stellar nucleosynthesis having proceeded in quite the same way in the solar neighborhood as well as at the galaxy cluster scale .",
    "specifically , this implies a similar ratio of type ia to type ii sns , as well as a similar imf ( r97 ) .",
    "if not else , this will help limiting the number of free parameters to play with .      in clusters of galaxies",
    "part of iron resides in stars , part in the icm , and the global iron abundance of the whole cluster is then given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average abundance of stars in galaxies and @xmath25 is the mass in stars .",
    "for the second equality i have assumed as prototypical the coma cluster values adopted by white et al .",
    "( 1993 ) : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . with @xmath28 solar and @xmath29 solar , equation ( 1 )",
    "gives a global cluster abundance of 0.34 , 0.37 , and 0.41 times solar , respectively for @xmath30 , 0.75 , and 1 . under the same assumptions ,",
    "the ratio of the iron mass in the icm to the iron mass locked into stars is : @xmath31 or 4.6 , 2.5 , and 1.65 , respectively for @xmath30 , 0.75 , and 1 .",
    "note that with the adopted values for the quantities in equation ( 2 ) most of the iron is in the icm , rather than now locked into stars , especially for low values of @xmath32 .",
    "these estimates could be somewhat decreased if clusters contain a sizable population of stars not bound to censed individual galaxies , if the average iron abundance in stars is supersolar ( luminosity - weighted determinations underestimate true abundances , greggio 1997 ) , or if the galaxy @xmath33 ratio is higher than adopted here , i.e. , @xmath34 ( white et al .",
    "however , the bottom line is that there are at least as much metals inside cluster galaxies , as there are out of them in the icm .",
    "this must be taken as a strong constraint when modelling the chemical evolution of galaxies : clearly they do not evolve as a closed box , and outflows must play a leading role .    with the adopted masses and iron abundances for the two baryonic components one can also evaluate the total cluster : @xmath35 or = 0.037 or 0.034 @xmath36 , respectively for @xmath30 and 1 .",
    "the total  is therefore fairly insensitive to the adopted distance scale .",
    "simple calculations ( cf .",
    "renzini et al .",
    "1993 ) show that to reproduce this value one needs either a fairly flat imf ( @xmath37 ) if all iron is attributed to snii s , or a major contribution from snia s , if one adopts a salpeter imf ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the former option dictates a substantial @xmath10-element enhancement , similar to the values observed in the galactic halo ( [ @xmath10/fe]@xmath39 ) .",
    "the latter option instead predicts near solar proportions for the cluster as a whole .",
    "the evidence presented in section 2.1 favors of the second option . from the near solar proportions of cluster abundances one obtains the total metal mass to light ratio of a typical cluster as @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth noting that this is an interesting estimate of the metal yield of stellar populations that is fully empirical .",
    "following tinsley ( 1980 ) the metal yield is usually defined per unit mass of stars , a quantity which theoretical analog depends on the poorly known low mass end of the imf .",
    "the estimate above gives instead the yield per unit luminosity of present day cluster galaxies , a quantity that depends on the imf only for @xmath41 .",
    "theoretical mass - related yields have been recently estimated by thomas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) based on massive star models by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and thielemann et al .",
    "these yields can be purged from their mass dependence , and transformed into luminosity - related yields . for this purpose",
    "i assume an age of 15 gyr for the bulk of stars in clusters ( cf . section 4 ) , and use the luminosity - imf normalization from ( renzini 1994 ) : i.e. @xmath42 for the imf , one has @xmath43 .",
    "thus , theoretical yields turn out to be @xmath44 , 0.24 , and @xmath45 , respectively for @xmath46 , 1.35 , and 1.00 , which compares to @xmath47 for the empirical cluster value .",
    "one can conclude that current stellar yields do not require a very flat imf to account for the cluster metals .",
    "a critical issue is to what extent the cluster global metallicity , and the icm to galaxies iron share are representative of the low@xmath48 universe as a whole .",
    "for example , madau et al . (",
    "1996 ) adopt @xmath49 , a stellar mass density parameter @xmath50 , a baryon mass density parameter @xmath51 , an average solar metallicity for the stars , and a negligible metal content for the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , that comprises the vast majority of the baryons . with these assumptions",
    "the metallicity of the present day universe is @xmath52 solar , or @xmath53 times lower than the measured value in clusters of galaxies . in the same frame ,",
    "the fraction of baryons in galaxies ( stars ) is @xmath54 , which compares to @xmath55 in clusters , or @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively for @xmath30 and 0.75 .",
    "therefore , it appears that the efficiency of baryon conversion into galaxies and stars adopted by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is nearly the same as that observed in clusters , which supports the notion of clusters being representative of the low-@xmath1 universe @xmath58 .",
    "the metallicity of the clusters is however @xmath53 times higher than the metallicity of the low-@xmath1 universe adopted by madau et al .. the difference comes from having assumed the igm to be devoid metals , hence assuming field galaxies losing a negligible amount of metals , contrary to cluster galaxies which instead appear to have lost a major fraction of the metals they have produced . since the average stellar metallicity is assumed to be solar in both clusters and field , this also implies a factor @xmath53 lower efficiency in metal production per unit mass turned into stars ( yield ) , compared to galaxy clusters .",
    "assuming to be real , such drastic differences between the behavior of galaxies and stellar populations in clusters and in the field would require quite contrived explanations ( r97 ) .",
    "more attractive for its simplicity appears to be the alternative according to which no major difference exists between field and clusters , and the global metallicity of the present day universe is nearly the same as that observed in galaxy clusters , i.e. , @xmath0 times solar .",
    "if so , there should be a comparable share of metals in the field igm , as there is in the cluster icm , i.e. , most of the metals should reside in the igm rather than within field galaxies ( r97 ) .",
    "in the previous section i have argued that the present metallicity of the universe , hence the global , time - averaged rate of metal production in are likely to be @xmath53 times higher than was adopted by madau et al .",
    "however , contrary to mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) , this does not necessarily imply that the global , time - averaged sfr was also underestimated by the same factor , because madau et al . have adopted for the baryon to stars conversion efficiency of the general field precisely the same value found in clusters .",
    "therefore , rather than to an higher average sfr one can appeal to an higher metal yield , actually , just about the same yield empirically determined for the clusters .",
    "now , what is the main epoch of metal production in the universe ? or , equivalently , when the cosmic sfr has reached its peak value ?",
    "the most straightforward approach to answer these questions is certainly offered by the direct determination of the global sfr as a function of redshift ( the madau diagram ) . however , as well known , direct determinations of the global sfr at high redshift encounters two major difficulties : 1 ) dust obscuration , which on average may be higher than in low redshift galaxies since star formation may predominantly take place in major dust enshrouded , _",
    "bulge - forming _ starbursts , rather than more quiescently as later in disks and irregulars ; and 2 ) alternatively , a sizable fraction of the global sfr may take place in small entities below detection threshold , as predicted by current hierarchical models ( e.g. kaufmann 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , the complementary approach based on the fossil record at low redshift will provide a vision of the early universe from a different point of view , hence subject to different biases and uncertainties .",
    "ultimately , the two approaches will have to lead to converging results .",
    "it is now well established by several independent lines of evidence that the bulk of stars in cluster ellipticals formed at high redshift , i.e. , @xmath2 ( an extensive set of references is not reported here for lack of space , but can be found in r97 ) .",
    "this important conclusion comes from the tightness of the color@xmath59 relation of ellipticals in nearby clusters , the tightness of the distributions of cluster ellipticals about their fundamental plane at low and high redshift , the tightness of the mg@xmath60 relation , again at low as well as high redshift , the tightness of the color - magnitude relation of cluster ellipticals at high redshift , and the small color and fundamental plane evolution out to @xmath61 .",
    "this _ old age _ conclusion can be generalized to include field ellipticals as well as the bulges of spirals , and state that the bulk of stars in galactic spheroids formed at high redshift , i.e. @xmath62 . indeed",
    ", field ellipticals appear to follow the same mg@xmath60 relation of their cluster analogs ( bernardi et al . 1998 ) , while galactic bulges follow the same mg@xmath63-luminosity ( and mg@xmath60 ) relation of ellipticals ( jablonka et al .",
    "moreover , stellar photometry shows that the bulk of stars in the galactic bulge are as old as the galactic halo , or @xmath64 gyr ( ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ) , and that there is no evidence for an intermediate age population in the bulge of m31 and its elliptical satellites m32 and ngc 147 ( renzini 1998 ) . the milky way and m31 reside in a small , spiral dominated group and yet their bulges are @xmath64 gyr old .",
    "it seems reasonable to generalize this to virtually all bulges , given also the strong similarity of bulges and ellipticals .",
    "acoording to schechter & dressler ( 1987 ) , bulges account for nearly the same star mass as disks , while the star mass in e / s0 galaxies is about twice that in spirals ( persic & salucci 1992 ) .",
    "hence , it seems legitimate to conclude that galactic spheroids contain @xmath65 of the baryons now locked into stars .",
    "therefore , if the bulk of stars in spheroids formed at @xmath2 , and they account for @xmath66 of the stellar mass at @xmath67 , putting two and two together : @xmath68 some 30% of all stars have formed at @xmath2 , @xmath68 hence , @xmath69 of all the metals have been produced at @xmath2 , @xmath68 hence , the metallicity of the universe at @xmath6 should be @xmath0 of its present day value ( @xmath0 solar ) , i.e. , @xmath7 solar , or @xmath70 .    at first sight",
    "these inferences from the local , fossil evidence appear to conflict with some model predictions , and with some of the current interpretations of the direct observations at @xmath71 .",
    "for example , the standard cdm model of cole et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and baugh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) predicts that only @xmath72 of stars have formed by @xmath6 .",
    "tuning the free parameters of this specific cdm model does not seem to work without violating other observational constraints ( frenk , this conference ) .",
    "it seems that more drastic changes are required to produce @xmath69 of the stars by @xmath6 , perhaps appealing to isocurvature models designed to allow the early assembly of large galaxies ( peebles 1997 ) .",
    "as far as direct observations are concerned , the fossil evidence supports the interpretation as _ lower limits _ of the sfr estimates at @xmath2 ( e.g. madau et al . 1996 ) . of the two models presented by madau",
    "( 1997 ) the one in which the sfr slowly increases all the way to @xmath73 is favored .",
    "it remains to be ascertained whether the undetected star formation activity is obscured by dust , or dispersed in small fragments below the threshold of the hubble deep field .    finally , the predicted global metallicity at @xmath6 ( @xmath7 solar , or more ) is subject to observational test via the damped ly@xmath74 systems ( dla ) .",
    "these systems may again provide a biased vision of the early universe , as neither giant starbursts that would be dust obscured , nor the metal rich passively evolving spheroids or the hot icm / igm enlist among dlas .",
    "nevertheless , the average metallicity of the absorbers at @xmath6 appears to be @xmath75 solar ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 , cf . fig .",
    "4 ) , just a factor of 2 below the expected value from the _ fossil evidence_. however , this is much higher than the lower limit to @xmath76 at @xmath6 as inferred from ly@xmath74 forest observations ( songaila 1997 ) , which suggests the universe being very inhomogeneous at that epoch .",
    "i would like to make a last point before closing . while there is now compelling evidence for the stellar populations of ellipticals and bulges being very old , it is fair to say that the evidence for rather old disk is also growing .",
    "as well known , the ratio of present to average past sfr increases along the hubble sequence , and is well below unity at least up to sbc galaxies ( kennicutt et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this means that sfrs in such disks were much higher in the past , hence disks are also dominated by rather old stars .",
    "moreover , all sfr indicators are found to anticorrelate tightly with the @xmath77-band luminosity ( hence mass ) of spiral galaxies ( gavazzi et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e. , the heavier a galaxy , the lower its current sfr , and the older its stellar populations .",
    "big disks appear to have burned most of their gas at early times , while most of the cosmic star formation is now confined to lesser galaxies .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation do not naturally account for the angular momentum of real spirals ( navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) . perhaps adding the additional problem of accounting for",
    "the observed mass - age correlation may help finding the solution .",
