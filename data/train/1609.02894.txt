    "the azimuthal momentum anisotropy of particle emission relative to the participant plane of the collision , as quantified by the fourier coefficients @xmath7 of the final state particle yield , has long been considered evidence for the formation of a strongly interacting , fluid - like quark - gluon plasma in collisions  @xcite .",
    "viscous hydrodynamics supports a picture in which the initial spatial distribution in energy density , both from intrinsic geometry and fluctuations , is propagated into the final state as anisotropies in momentum space .",
    "the success of hydrodynamics in describing various bulk observables of the qgp has lent credence to the notion of hydrodynamic flow as the main driver of the @xmath8 signal in heavy collisions .",
    "however , recent analyses of and collisions at = 200 gev  @xcite at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) , and at = 5.02 tev , and @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1 collisions at = 2.76 , 5.02 , 7 , and 13 tev  @xcite at the large hadron collider have demonstrated the existence of the same kind of azimuthal anisotropy signals commonly interpreted as evidence of collective behavior in larger systems .",
    "notably , a feature known as _",
    "the ridge _ has been observed , consisting of a near - side ( i.e. , at small relative azimuth ) enhancement in the long - range ( i.e. , at large relative pseudorapidity ) azimuthal two - particle correlation . from these correlations ,",
    "substantial elliptic ( @xmath0 ) , and triangular ( @xmath9 ) flow coefficients have been measured in these systems .    although these observations seem to support the idea of qgp formation in small systems , it is not clear that hydrodynamic expansion would translate initial geometry into final state momentum anisotropy in this regime , where the formed medium is expected to be short - lived .",
    "other explanations have been put forth , including initial state effects from glasma diagrams  @xcite , color recombination  @xcite , and partonic scattering in transport models  @xcite .",
    "transport model calculations , as well as those from hydrodynamics , involve the translation of initial geometry into momentum space via final state interactions .",
    "transport models describe interactions between well defined particles in kinetic theory , while hydrodynamics involves fluid elements .",
    "in contrast , glasma diagrams take momentum - space domains as a starting point , resulting in momentum correlations without any final - state interactions . in this initial momentum - space domain picture , the correlations averaged over the event should become weaker in going from , to , to as the average is taken over a larger number of domains , thus diluting the strength of the correlation effect .",
    "there is no direct correspondence with the initial geometric eccentricity in this picture . a key experimental test to resolve the issue consists in varying the initial geometry of the system to analyze the extent to which it carries into the final state  @xcite",
    "the phenix collaboration has actively pursued this course of study by analyzing data from intrinsically elliptic ( )  @xcite and triangular ( )  @xcite collision systems at = 200 gev .",
    "viscous hydrodynamics followed by a hadron cascade has been found to accurately reproduce the measured @xmath7  @xcite for these systems .",
    "this article completes the above suite of studies by presenting two - particle correlations and the transverse momentum ( ) dependence of @xmath0 for central collisions at = 200 gev . in small system collisions",
    ", the term _ central _ refers to events with high - multiplicity and the correlation with actual impact parameter is weak .",
    "these results are compared to those from and collisions , as well as to available theoretical calculations .",
    "we apply the same analysis procedure to all three systems in the same centrality class , to provide a controlled comparison from which to draw conclusions .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for this analysis , charged particles",
    "were reconstructed with the two central arm spectrometers , consisting of drift chambers and multi - wire proportional pad chambers ( pc ) , each covering @xmath10 in pseudorapidity and @xmath11 in azimuth .",
    "drift chamber tracks are matched to hits in the third ( outermost ) layer of the pc , thus limiting the contribution of tracks from decays and photon conversions .",
    "the beam - beam counters ( bbc ) comprise two arrays of 64 quartz radiator erenkov detectors , located longitudinally @xmath121.44 m away from the center of the interaction region ( ir ) , covering and 2@xmath13 in azimuth .",
    "the forward vertex detector ( fvtx ) is a silicon detector comprising two identical end - cap assemblies symmetrically located in the longitudinal direction around the ir , covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath14 .",
    "it uses hit clusters to detect charged particles with an efficiency greater than 95% .",
    "the arms of the bbc and fvtx in the au - going direction ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) are designated as the _ south _ arms and styled bbc - s and fvtx - s , respectively .",
    "we use the south arm of each of these two detectors to determine the flow event plane .",
    "in addition , the @xmath16-vertex of the collision is found using event timing information from both arms of the bbc . in this analysis , a @xmath1210 cm cut on the collision @xmath16-vertex was applied .",
    "we compare correlation functions with those measured in @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1 , as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the data set for this analysis was collected during the 2015 data - taking run at rhic .",
    "it comprises 0.84 billion minimum bias ( mb ) triggered events and 1.4 billion high - multiplicity triggered events .",
    "the mb trigger is defined as a coincidence in the same event between the bbc detectors in the au - going and @xmath1-going directions , requiring at least one photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) firing in each ; in this way 84@xmath124% of the total inelastic cross section is captured .",
    "the high - multiplicity trigger is based on the mb trigger , but imposes the additional requirement of more than 35 photomultiplier tubes firing in the bbc - s .",
    "events that satisfy this trigger condition correspond roughly to the 5% most central event class .",
    "the use of this trigger allows us to increase our central event sample size by a factor of 25 .",
    "we select the 0%5% most central events , where centrality classes are defined by the percentiles of the total multiplicity measured in the bbc - s , following the procedure documented in ref .",
    "the initial geometry of events in these centrality selections is characterized using a standard monte carlo glauber approach , where nucleon coordinates are smeared by a two - dimensional gaussian of width @xmath17 fm .    in this model ,",
    "initial state eccentricity @xmath6 is computed from initial gaussian - smeared nucleon coordinates : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the radial nucleon position relative to the centroid of the participants , and @xmath20 is the nucleon azimuthal angle .",
    "the results of this glauber characterization of the initial geometry are shown in table  [ table_geometry ] .",
    ".geometric characterization of small system collisions at  =  200 gev in the 0%5% centrality class , using monte carlo glauber with nucleon coordinates smeared by a two - dimensional gaussian of width @xmath21  fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the case of and , a better agreement with data can be achieved by increasing the value of @xmath22/s or by including a hadronic cascade stage . however , doing so would lower the prediction for even further .",
    "this demonstrates that ip - glasma does not generate the appropriate initial conditions to account for measured @xmath7 via hydrodynamic flow .",
    "it is important to notice that additional degrees of freedom for the geometry of collisions arise from fluctuations of the shape of the proton , as described in ref .",
    "the contribution of this effect to the measured elliptic flow may be constrained by @xmath1@xmath2@xmath1 data , and also possibly by varying the target in other @xmath23a systems .",
    "an additional framework accounting for sub - nucleonic degrees of freedom extends the monte carlo glauber approach to also incorporate collisions between constituent quarks  @xcite . recently",
    ", this framework has been successfully applied to the description of midrapidity charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy production  @xcite .",
    "different implementations of constituent quark monte carlo glauber calculations are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "13(f ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial eccentricities @xmath6 in , , and obtained by incorporating constituent quarks in addition to multiplicity fluctuations are found to be @xmath24 0.42 , 0.54 , and 0.54 , respectively .",
    "this calculation assumes a gaussian density distribution of low-@xmath25 gluons around each constituent quark , of width @xmath26 fm .",
    "it is interesting to note that the and systems show little sensitivity to the incorporation of both constituent quarks and multiplicity fluctuations into the calculation of the initial @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , under the same circumstances , has a substantially larger @xmath6 than in the models shown in table  [ table_geometry_glasma ] . ref .",
    "@xcite also presents calculations incorporating nucleonic degrees of freedom and multiplicity fluctuations , in which case a lower @xmath27 is obtained for .",
    "this shows that , when compared to the glauber @xmath6 for in table  [ table_geometry_glasma ] , quark - level degrees of freedom and multiplicity fluctuations may both play a significant role .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations with these initial conditions will be of interest for future studies .",
    "finally , ampt combines partonic and hadronic scattering in a single model .",
    "central ampt events with impact parameter @xmath28 have a midrapidity @xmath29 = 8.1 , 14.8 , and 20.7 for , , and , respectively .",
    "these were generated with the same monte carlo glauber initial conditions used to characterize event geometry , and thus have very similar eccentricities to those given in table i. using the initial glauber geometry information to compute @xmath0 relative to the participant plane  @xcite yields results that agree reasonably well with the data below @xmath30 gev/@xmath31 , yet underpredict them at higher .",
    "it is noteworthy that despite the very different physics of ampt compared to the other models , it has successfully been applied to a variety of collision systems at rhic and the large hadron collider  @xcite .",
    "we have presented results on azimuthal anisotropy and elliptic flow in central at = 200 gev , compared with @xmath0 in and collisions .",
    "these results impose strong constraints on any model attempting to describe small system collectivity , whether by the formation of strongly interacting hot nuclear matter , or other mechanisms .",
    "we observe an imperfect scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath6 , well reproduced by hydrodynamics , providing strong evidence for initial geometry as the source of final - state momentum anisotropy in these systems .",
    "this disfavors other explanations based on initial - state momentum space domain effects .",
    "further insight into the nature of small system collectivity can be gained by analyzing the centrality and collision energy dependence of @xmath0 , and will be the subject of future studies .",
