    "lorentz symmetry is one of the most significant and fundamental principles in physics , and it contains two aspects : lorentz covariance and lorentz invariance .",
    "nowadays , there have been increasing interests in lorentz invariance violation ( lv ) both theoretically and experimentally ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . in this paper",
    "we find out a general principle , which provides a consistent framework to describe the lv effects .",
    "it requires the following replacements of the ordinary partial derivative @xmath1 and covariant derivative @xmath2 by the co - derivative ones @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a local matrix . in the following ,",
    "we introduce this general principle at first , and then explore its physical implications and consequences .",
    "principle : under any one - to - one transformation @xmath5 on mathematical background manifold , the transformation @xmath6 of an arbitrary physical field @xmath7 should satisfy @xmath8    most generally , this principle can be handled in geometric algebra @xmath9 ( or clifford algebra ) and geometric calculus ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "the general element in geometric algebra is called a multivector , and addition and various products of two multivectors are still a multivector , i.e. geometric algebra is closed .",
    "different variables in physics , such as scalar , vector , tensor , spinor , twistor , matrix , etc .",
    ", can be described by the corresponding types of multivectors in a unified form in geometric algebra ( see , e.g. , refs . for details ) .",
    "@xmath10 is a multivector - valued function of a multivector variable @xmath11 , and it can be decomposed in an arbitrary local coordinate system with the basis vectors @xmath12 as @xmath13 where `` @xmath14 '' is called wedge product , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 for @xmath17 , and @xmath18 with @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the components of @xmath7 and @xmath21 denotes tensor index .",
    "we should not be frustrated by the operation algorithms in geometric algebra , but could consider a general multivector @xmath22 just as an ordinary vector and that two multivectors @xmath22 and @xmath23 are not commutable , namely @xmath24 , somehow like matrices . remembering",
    "these two points will suffice the following discussions .",
    "what should be kept in mind is that in this new framework , the commonly used tensor notation @xmath25 only represents the component of @xmath22 with respect to a specific coordinate basis .",
    "conventionally one simply means a multivector @xmath22 by its component @xmath26 and regards the transformation rules for these components from one basis to another as the transformation of a multivector .",
    "however , a multivector should be coordinate - independent .",
    "for instance , @xmath27 is a multivector and does not change under any coordinate transformation but its component @xmath28 does .",
    "this general principle actually makes the field @xmath7 represent a physical distribution , rather than a common mathematical function .",
    "although the uniqueness of reality can be mathematically described in many ways like @xmath7 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the physics behind remains unchanged , saying independence or invariance .",
    "so ( [ eqn : pfimbm ] ) claims physical independence or physical invariance ( pi ) on mathematical background manifold .    for the field",
    "@xmath7 satisfying ( [ eqn : pfimbm ] ) , its derivative field might be naively defined as @xmath32 but does this definition still fulfil ( [ eqn : pfimbm ] ) ? if @xmath33 is a physical field , there must be the condition @xmath34 according to pi .",
    "however , @xmath35 where we define @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is linear to  @xmath38 \" .",
    "so the above - mentioned definition of @xmath33 fails to satisfy pi .",
    "the problem arises from the derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we redefine the derivative field as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is linear to  @xmath38 \" and has the covariant transformation property @xmath42",
    "thus we have @xmath43 according to ( [ eqn : pfimbm ] ) , @xmath33 is now indeed a physical field .",
    "we realize the principle of pi via the introduction of @xmath44 and the replacement of @xmath45",
    "the derivations in section 2 are coordinate - free .",
    "if concrete calculations are concerned , we may specify a coordinate system with basis @xmath46 , and the completeness relation leads to @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "we call @xmath49 the background matrix ( bm ) field .",
    "if we choose another coordinate frame @xmath50 , the coordinate transformation is @xmath51 , with @xmath52 being the coordinate transformation matrix .",
    "therefore , @xmath49 is accordingly transformed to @xmath53 so the component @xmath49 is coordinate - dependent and transforms in the same way as a common tensor .",
    "furthermore for @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 where the second and third items result from the facts that @xmath56 is a scalar operator and @xmath41 is linear to  @xmath38 \" .",
    "so the replacement for the component @xmath56 of a multivector @xmath57 is @xmath58    we now turn our attention to the physical implications of the bm and show that it contains lv and information of anisotropy of spacetime . but",
    "ahead of that , for the integrity and consistence of a complete framework , we further provide another principle aside from the one of pi for the discussion of covariant derivatives and various gauge fields related with local symmetries .",
    "if a symmetry group is local to manifold , we must define a covariant derivative operator to maintain the covariance of the lagrangian under gauge transformations . if there exists a scalar operator @xmath59 , which applies to two arbitrary fields @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 we demand the principle of covariance : under the transformation @xmath63 there is a corresponding transformation , @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an invertible multivector in @xmath9 , standing for various local symmetries , with specific matrix representations like su(n ) or so(n ) . the operator @xmath59 is named as covariant derivative , and the principle of covariance can determine the forms of @xmath59 and further introduce gauge fields with respect to the local symmetry @xmath66 in the framework of geometric algebra .",
    "@xmath59 in geometric algebra may have different forms in the standard model ( sm ) , differential geometry , and general relativity , just as a symmetry group may have different representations .",
    "what we want to emphasize is that all definitions are equivalent and can be unified in geometric algebra .",
    "for example , from the viewpoint of general relativity , for a general multivector @xmath7 , we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 , with the coefficient @xmath69 named as connection .",
    "usually we define @xmath70 as the covariant derivative in general relativity .",
    "however in geometric algebra , we abandon this specific definition , and the property ( [ dproperty ] ) and the principle of covariance give an alternative choice .",
    "till now , we have all the physical and mathematical preparations ready .",
    "let us pause here and briefly sum up the basic ideas in our paper .",
    "( i ) when requiring the property of pi for an arbitrary field , we must introduce a local matrix @xmath49 to modify a derivative @xmath71 to a co - derivative @xmath72 .",
    "( ii ) when promoting a global symmetry to a local one , we have to change a derivative @xmath71 to a covariant derivative @xmath73 and acquire gauge fields .",
    "altogether these two considerations straightforwardly lead us to a new covariant co - derivative operator @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "this generation is the essence for the origin of the lv terms in the sm .",
    "when considering both the principles of pi and of covariance , we get @xmath76 with the coordinate - free covariant multivector derivative @xmath77 , and @xmath59 being the component of @xmath78 .",
    "so we arrive at our replacement for the covariant multivector derivative @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the replacement for its component @xmath80 , @xmath81    the replacements ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) are the consequences of the principles of both pi and covariance .",
    "the first principle indicates the existence of the bm , and the second is important to introduce covariant derivatives , local symmetries and gauge fields . for the goal of this paper , to explore the bm and its physical implications ,",
    "the principle of pi is enough .",
    "but for completeness and clearness , we simply discuss the principle of covariance .",
    "now , we move on to spacetime , which can be part of general geometric algebra space .",
    "so @xmath39 is replaced by spacetime coordinate @xmath82 , and the indices are explicitly denoted by @xmath83 instead of @xmath84 .",
    "section [ sec_bm ] provides the essentials to construct a mathematical - background - manifold - free and coordinate - free framework for physics .",
    "one of the significant results is that in order to satisfy the principle of pi , the common derivative @xmath1 and covariant derivative @xmath2 must be generalized to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with @xmath4 being the bm . except that",
    ", other basic fields remain untouched , because they do not involve with these two derivatives . in this section ,",
    "we follow this scheme and focus on the physical implications and consequences from these new introduced co - derivatives @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the minimal sm @xmath87 consists of the following four parts @xmath88 here @xmath23 is fermion field , @xmath89 is higgs field , and @xmath90 is its self - interaction .",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , with @xmath94 being the coupling constant , @xmath95 the structure constant , and @xmath96 the generator of gange groups respectively .",
    "@xmath97 is the yukawa coupling between fermion and higgs fields , which is not related to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , so it keeps unchanged under the replacement ( [ eqn : substitution ] ) .",
    "the chiral difference and the summation of chirality and gauge index are omitted here for simplicity .",
    "we divide @xmath4 into two parts @xmath100 , with @xmath101 as the metric of spacetime .",
    "( this decomposition will be fully discussed in the next section . ) under ( [ eqn : substitution ] ) , the lagrangians in ( [ eqn : smg ] ) , ( [ eqn : smf ] ) , and ( [ eqn : smhg ] ) become @xmath102 with the condition @xmath4 being real matrix to maintain the lagrangian hermitian .",
    "the last three terms @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 in ( [ eqn : smsg ] ) , ( [ eqn : smsf ] ) , and ( [ eqn : smshg ] ) are the supplement terms for the minimal sm , reading @xmath106    thus @xmath87 is modified to an effective lagrangian of the sm with supplement terms ( sms ) @xmath107 , @xmath108 with @xmath109 @xmath107 satisfies the invariance of gauge group su(3)@xmath110su(2)@xmath110u(1 ) and the invariance of pi .",
    "all the terms above in the lagrangians are lorentz scalars at more fundamental level than the minimal sm .",
    "but for the sm , @xmath111 is treated as coupling constants or background influences from this more fundamental theory , and all the other fields for the sm are what we are studying , so @xmath112 is not lorentz invariant under the observer s lorentz transformation on these fields . from this point of view , we call the supplement term @xmath112 the lorentz invariance violation term , and it contains the information of lv or anisotropy of spacetime in the sm .    to achieve a deeper insight and clearer understanding for the sms here ,",
    "let us make a comparison with the commonly used standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite and try to figure out the relations of the various coupling constants . keeping the conventions in ref . and omitting detailed derivations , we summarize our results in table [ smsandsme ] .",
    "we find : ( i )  @xmath111 provides the most equivalent coupling constants in the sme of the lv items in the sectors of fermion , gauge , and higgs fields ; ( ii )  the various combinations of @xmath111 as coupling constants own a different cpt property .",
    "for example , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are cpt - even , cpt - odd , cpt - even , and cpt - odd respectively .",
    "the sme in ref .",
    "includes all the possible lv terms of spontaneous symmetry breaking for the sm and it is mentioned that all these lv terms may origin from a fundamental theory .",
    "thus what we perform in this paper shows a fundamental way for the lv terms in the sm from basic principles .",
    "now let us turn to the local bm @xmath4 , of which the vacuum expectation value is used for the coupling constants in ( [ eqn : gv ] ) , ( [ eqn : fv ] ) and ( [ eqn : hgv ] )",
    ". we decompose @xmath4 into two parts @xmath117 where @xmath101 is the metric of spacetime .",
    "since all the elements of @xmath4 or @xmath111 are dimensionless , they naturally encode the strength of lv or the degree of anisotropy of spacetime  @xcite , i.e. @xmath118 hence we call @xmath111 the lorentz invariance violation matrix ( lvm ) , and its entries will be constrained with the help of laboratory experiments  @xcite and astronomical observations  @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "@xmath111 depend on the types of particles .",
    "while @xmath119 can be re - scaled to absorb one of the 16 degrees of freedom in @xmath111 , so that only 15 are left physical .",
    "thus in this paper , we assume @xmath120 , or @xmath121 .    as a result of the lvm",
    ", we may attain various modified dynamical equations of fields , as well as dispersion relations from the effective lagrangian @xmath107 . here as a preliminary test of our construction , we take the dirac equation for free fermion field @xmath122 as an example . first , we replace @xmath123 to @xmath124 , @xmath125 second , we multiply @xmath126 on both sides , @xmath127 with the fourier transformation @xmath128 , the extended dispersion relation becomes @xmath129 we see that the left - hand side of ( [ eqn : disper ] ) is not invariant under the observer s lorentz transformation on @xmath130 , reflecting the influences from the fundamental theory .",
    "so we claim that the last two items of the left - hand side of ( [ eqn : disper ] ) , which are the extensions of the ordinary mass - energy relation @xmath131 , contain the information of lv .",
    "systematic lv effects from the general form of @xmath111 still need further studies , but here we merely employ a special so(3 ) invariant model of lvm to demonstrate our mechanism .",
    "so we assume @xmath132 substituting ( [ eqn : limsimple ] ) into ( [ eqn : disper ] ) gives the extended dispersion relation for free fermion field in this simple case , @xmath133",
    "we could utilize proton to determine the upper bound of @xmath134 .",
    "the photopion production of nucleon in the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite observations gives an available energy threshold @xmath135  ev ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "the dominant channel for this production begins with @xmath136 .",
    "we concentrate on the head - on collision of the proton in cosmic rays and the photon from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the dispersion relations for @xmath130 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 are similar as that in ( [ fermiondisper ] ) , with the corresponding @xmath139 s denoted by @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 . as considering the lv of the high energy protons from cosmic rays ,",
    "we are allowed to assume @xmath143 .",
    "so in this channel , we have @xmath144 with @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 being the 4-momenta of @xmath130 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 respectively . using ( [ fermiondisper ] ) , we obtain @xmath148 for high energy protons , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 due to the head - on collision . we keep only @xmath151 in @xmath152 since the quadratic term @xmath153 is negligible , so the final expression for the energy @xmath154 of high energy protons satisfies the inequality @xmath155 in case of no lv for high energy protons , namely @xmath156 , we have @xmath157  ev , which is the common threshold energy for the gzk cutoff .",
    "( here @xmath158  mev , @xmath159  mev , and the mean energy of the photons in the cmb is taken as @xmath160  ev . ) for high energy photons from the cmb , we take @xmath161  mev for calculations .",
    "a small positive @xmath162 will increase the threshold energy , which can be higher than @xmath163  ev , and the constraint on @xmath162 is @xmath164 this constraint is consistent with our previous estimate in ref . .",
    "with a general requirement of the physical independence or physical invariance of mathematical background manifold , we introduce the background matrix @xmath4 , and the replacement of the common derivative operators by the covariant co - derivative ones .",
    "this replacement gives rise to supplement terms in the minimal standard model .",
    "we introduce a lorentz invariance violation matrix @xmath111 , which is able to characterize the lorentz invariance violation or spacetime anisotropy .",
    "thus we have a feeling that the principles of physical invariance and covariance are more fundamental than lorentz invariance or spacetime isotropy .",
