    "<S> with the recent investigations of @xmath0 transition form factor and @xmath1 mixing scheme , we present an updated study of the radiative decays @xmath2 in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the decays are taken as a test ground for the @xmath0 transition form factors and the @xmath1 mixing scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the form factors are found to be working for glunic @xmath3 productions and the mixing angle is constrained to be @xmath4 .    * </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 13.25gv , 12.38bx , 14.40aq *    as it is well known that the heavy quarkonium decays to light mesons have played very important role in testing and understanding qcd from the very beginning . </S>",
    "<S> the decays @xmath5 are of great interests since they are closely related to the issues of @xmath6 mixing and @xmath7 transition form factors , which are very important ingredients for understanding many interesting hadronic phenomena of @xmath8 and @xmath9 productions . for example , it would be very useful for explaining the large branching ratio of strong penguin dominated decay @xmath10@xcite .    in the literature , </S>",
    "<S> studies of the decays @xmath5 are different each other from the treatments of formatting gluons to @xmath3 , namely , direct nonperturbative @xmath11 coupling through strong anomaly@xcite or two off - shell gluons coupled to @xmath3 through quark loop@xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we will take the second approach which had been pioneered systematically within perturbative qcd by krner , khn , krammer and schneider(kkks ) @xcite years ago . in ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the non - relativistic quark model and the weak - binding approximation were used for both heavy and light mesons , and systematic helicity projectors were constructed to reduce loop integrations . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we follow their approach . </S>",
    "<S> however , two improvements are included :    * @xmath7 couplings are improved to be relativistic transition form factors as advocated in ref.@xcite in stead of non - relativistic modelling . * the @xmath6 mixing scheme </S>",
    "<S> is also updated to the feldmann - kroll - stech(fks ) mixing scheme@xcite .    in perturbative qcd approach , </S>",
    "<S> the decays are depicted by the feynman diagrams in fig.1 . to calculate the amplitudes for the decays , we need to know how to deal with the dynamics of bound states . </S>",
    "<S> generally , factorization are employed . </S>",
    "<S> soft nonperturbative qcd bound state dynamics are factorized to the decay constants and the wave functions of @xmath12 and @xmath3 which will convolute with the hard kernel induced the decay . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use the non - relativistic approximation for the heavy @xmath12 , but not for the light mesons @xmath13 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> although a rigorous theory from first principles for the light bound - states are still missing , some effective approaches are in progress . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , it has been realized that a proper treatment of the @xmath1 system requires a sharp distinction between the mixing states and the mixing properties of the decay constants@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> taking strange - nonstrange flavor basis for the @xmath1 system and the mixing of the decay constants following the same pattern of the state mixing , fks have found a dramatic simplification . </S>",
    "<S> they also have tested their mixing scheme against experiment and determined corrections to the first order values of the basic parameters from phenomenology .    in fks mixing scheme the parton fock state decomposition can be expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mixing angle , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the mixing angle @xmath15 have been constrained from the available experimental data , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite .    already in ref.@xcite , baier and grozin have derived evolution equations for the distribution functions @xmath23 to the first order of @xmath24 , which eigenfunctions are found to be @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 , the coefficients @xmath27 evolve to zero and @xmath23 turns out to be @xmath28 . when evolution equations run down to low energy scale , its quark contents mixed with glunic states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gluon content enters the @xmath3 wave function from next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> this observation encourages the calculations of the @xmath7 transition form factors similarly to the well known @xmath29 transition form factor at leading order , which read @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to the accuracy of this paper , @xmath34 is taken to be the leading twist distribution functions(das ) @xmath35 .    using @xmath36 in eq.[formf ] and following the procedure developed in ref.@xcite , it is straightforward to evaluate the amplitudes for the decays as depicted by feynman diagrams in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> . we get @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the heavy quark electric charge and @xmath40 is the color factor . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless scalar function @xmath41 containing loop integrals is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .    obviously in eq.[int1 </S>",
    "<S> ] , the @xmath47 numerator would cancel the @xmath13 form factor if it is taken be @xmath48 , and the hard scattering kernel would not convolute with the distribution functions of @xmath9 .      for numerical results for the decays , we use @xmath50@xcite , @xmath51 and @xmath52@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath53 while @xmath54 agrees with experiment , @xmath55 turns out to be too small . from the mixing scheme , </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that @xmath56 is @xmath57 to the mixing angle @xmath15 when @xmath15 is about @xmath58 , but @xmath59 is very @xmath60 to @xmath15 . take @xmath61 fitted from @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite , we find @xmath64 which agree with experimental results quite well . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we take @xmath65 , the results turn out to overshoot their experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the most theoretical uncertainty may arise from the energy scale choice in @xmath66 . because our calculation is performed at the lowest order in qcd and </S>",
    "<S> there is no uv divergence in the loop diagram induced the decay , we do nt have strong argument to choose a scale , as in usual case , to minimize the higher order corrections by setting logarithm to zero . naively , the scale could be chosen from @xmath67 to @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> to reduce the scale dependence , we relate @xmath69 to @xmath70 @xmath71 with the help of the known results@xcite @xmath72 \\biggr\\},\\ ] ] we can get @xmath73 }                   { \\mathcal b}(j/\\psi \\to ggg).\\ ] ] we will use the following relation and experimental data@xcite for our numerical results @xmath74 taking @xmath61 and @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 which agree with the experiment data .    in fig.2 , we display the ratio @xmath77 as a function of @xmath15 , in which we expect that the relativistic and the higher order qcd corrections may be concealed to large extent , so that the ratio could be predicted much more reliable than the two decay rates respectively . comparing our results with the experimental measurement @xmath78@xcite as displayed by horizontal lines in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath4 which is different from the value @xmath79 by @xmath80 also determined from @xmath81@xcite by using qcd anomaly dominance mechanism formula . to make clear the origin of the discrepancy between the two different determination of mixing angle @xmath15 , we recapitulate the key formula from the well known work of novikov @xmath82 @xcite @xmath83 this formula is frequently employed to determine @xmath84 mixing angles in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> technologically , the strong anomaly dominance is equivalent to the dominance of the ground state and the neglect of continuum contribution to dispersion relations as shown in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , considering the experimental and the theoretical uncertainties , the difference between the predictions for @xmath85 by the two mechanism is still marginal . </S>",
    "<S> although we have improved @xmath0 couplings in ref.@xcite from non - relativistic to relativistic , there is still large room for theoretical improvements which is very worth for further studying . </S>",
    "<S> we also note the cleo / cesr - c project is going , where about one billion @xmath86 events would be produced . </S>",
    "<S> the refined measurements of these decays to be performed at cleo - c will deepen our understanding of the two @xmath3 production mechanisms .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the radiative decays @xmath87 in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic @xmath0 transition form factors have been tested to be working for @xmath9 production . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing angle in fks scheme is constrained to be @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this study encourages further applications of the form factor for @xmath3 production in hard processes . </S>",
    "<S> it is also very helpful for understanding the abnormal large @xmath9 yields in b meson decays , which have caught many theoretical attentions@xcite recently . </S>"
