    "the @xmath0 isoscalar - scalar resonance  also known as @xmath1 meson , or the correlated two - pion exchange with those quantum numbers , plays a prominent role in nucleon - nucleon attraction as well as in the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "its properties and nature are therefore very relevant for nuclear and particle physics , and it even has implications for cosmological and anthropic considerations .",
    "however , even though a scalar - isoscalar field was first proposed @xcite more than 65 years ago to explain nucleon - nucleon attraction , its description in terms of quarks and gluons is still the subject of an intense debate .",
    "concerning the properties , namely its mass and width , it seems that the issue has been finally solved ( see @xcite for a brief review ) using elaborated dispersive analyses of existing data , and this is why in the last edition of the particle data tables ( pdt)@xcite , the former @xmath3 meson , previously quoted with a huge mass uncertainty from 400 to 1200 mev , has changed name to @xmath0 and is now quoted with a mass between 400 and 550 mev .",
    "a similar reduction has taken place in the pdt for the width . nevertheless , the very pdt suggest in their `` note on light scalars below 2 gev '' that one could `` take the more radical point of view and just average the most advanced dispersive analyses '' @xcite , and obtain an estimated pole position at @xmath4 mev .",
    "with the mass and width issue solved , we need to understand its composition in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "actually , the inverted mass hierarchy of the lightest scalar nonet , of which the @xmath1 is the lightest member , hints at a possible tetraquark nature , as suggested long ago in @xcite .",
    "however , thesigma nature is still a matter of intense debate today , due to the poor quality of the data available , the use of some strong model dependent analyses , and the additional complication of mixing between different configurations , which is expected to be very relevant in the meson sector .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the supporting evidence , there is a growing consensus that the tetraquark  or possibly molecular  component might be dominant although it could be mixed with components of a different nature .",
    "the results of our group , that we review next , support this interpretation .",
    "the @xmath7 expansion of qcd @xcite , @xmath2 being the number of colors , can be applied at all energies ( not only at high energies as the usual expansion in the coupling ) and , for our purposes , provides a prediction for the leading order behavior of @xmath5 mesons , whose mass and width scale as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the behavior of other configurations is also known @xcite .      if the pole @xmath10 of an elastic resonance ( like the @xmath1 ) behaves as a @xmath5 then the scattering phase shift where it appears satisfies @xcite : @xmath11 from which we have shown @xcite that the adimensional observables @xmath12'}{\\delta'\\sigma}\\big\\vert_{m_r^2}\\equiv\\delta_2=1+\\frac{b}{n_c^2 } .... \\label{abdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are equal to one up to corrections suppressed by more than just one power of @xmath7 . since",
    "@xmath13 are naturally expected to be of order one _ or less _ ( cancellations with higher order terms can substantially decrease their effective value , but not increase it ) , and are coefficients of very suppressed corrections , they are very sensitive to deviations from a @xmath5 behavior .",
    "now , we can use the scattering phase shifts obtained in @xcite within a model independent dispersive analysis of data and the @xmath1 and @xmath14 pole positions corresponding to that analysis , which are found in @xcite .",
    "altogether , these yield , for the @xmath14 ( widely accepted as an ordinary @xmath5 resonance ) : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in good agreement with the expectations .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath1 , we find : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "two or more orders of magnitude larger than expected for a @xmath5 .",
    "_ this is a strong and model independent support for a predominant non-@xmath5 component for the @xmath0 _ , since it only makes use of the qcd leading behavior of @xmath5 states and a dispersive data analysis .",
    "a glueball component @xcite , whose width scales as @xmath19 , is more disfavored since the resulting @xmath13 are one order of magnitude larger .      a different approach consists on using a partial wave dispersion relation for the inverse amplitude in order to describe the @xmath20 scattering data .",
    "the elastic inverse amplitude method ( iam)@xcite uses chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite to evaluate the subtraction constants and the left cut of the dispersion relation .",
    "the elastic right cut is exact in the elastic approximation , since the elastic unitarity condition @xmath21 , fixes @xmath22 .",
    "note that the iam is derived only from exact elastic unitarity , analyticity in the form of a dispersion relation and chpt , which is only used at low energies , and reproduces meson - meson scattering data up to energies @xmath23gev .",
    "it can be analytically continued into the second riemann sheet to find the poles associated to the @xmath14 and @xmath0 resonances , which are generated from the unitarization process .",
    "the dependence on the qcd number of colors is implemented @xcite through the model independent leading @xmath7 scaling of the chpt low energy constants ( lecs ) @xcite .",
    "hence , by varying @xmath2 in the lecs , we obtain the @xmath14 and @xmath0 behavior .",
    "this can be done within chpt to one - loop , @xmath24 @xcite , or two - loops , @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "thus , we show in the left panel of fig.[fig : f1h ] the @xmath14 pole movement in the complex plane . as expected for a @xmath5 its mass",
    "barely moves , whereas the width decreases with @xmath7 . in the center and right",
    "panels we compare the behavior of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 observables defined above , versus their expected @xmath28 or @xmath7 behavior for ordinary mesons .",
    "note the @xmath29 is very consistent with the expected behavior , but the @xmath0 is completely at odds with it .",
    "actually , from fig.[fig : f2h ] , which includes the uncertainty in the one - loop calculation , parameterized by the renormalization scale @xmath30 of the lecs @xcite , we note that not far from @xmath31 , the width always grows as the pole moves deep in the lower complex plane as @xmath2 increases , in contrast to the shrinking width observed for the @xmath14 in fig.[fig : f1h ] .",
    "this result , obtained not far from @xmath31 is very robust within uncertainties and has been confirmed by several authors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , within the uncertainties , it is possible for the width to keep growing or decrease again .",
    "the latter could be interpreted as the effect of mixing with another @xmath5 component , which is subdominant in the @xmath31 physical world , but becomes dominant at larger @xmath2 .",
    "note however , that this subdominant @xmath5 component only arises _ above 1 gev _",
    "@xcite , unless one spoils the data description or the @xmath14 @xmath5 behavior",
    ". this scenario could be expected within the most common interpretation , which suggests that the lightest scalar nonet is of a non-@xmath5 nature , whereas the first ordinary @xmath5 nonet appears around 1 to 1.5 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this `` subdominant @xmath5 component around 1 - 1.5 gev '' scenario is favored by the two - loop analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , our picture is qualitatively consistent with recent lattice calculations @xcite finding that the lightest scalar is about a factor 1.5 heavier than the @xmath29 in the @xmath32 limit .",
    "behavior of the @xmath14 pole .",
    "( center and right ) the @xmath26 and @xmath27 observables both for the @xmath14 and @xmath0 , versus the expected behavior for a @xmath5.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   behavior of the @xmath14 pole .",
    "( center and right ) the @xmath26 and @xmath27 observables both for the @xmath14 and @xmath0 , versus the expected behavior for a @xmath5.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     behavior of the @xmath0 pole , including uncertainties . not far from @xmath31 the width increases dramatically with @xmath2 , at odds with a @xmath5 dominant component ( compare the @xmath14 in fig.1 ) . at two loops the preferred solution comes close to the @xmath33mev case .",
    "the figure is from @xcite , width=415 ]      in the real world ( @xmath2 = 3 ) and low energies , the scattering amplitude is well represented by a sum of resonances ( with a background ) , but as the energy increases , the resonances ( having more phase space for decay ) become wider and increasingly overlap .",
    "this overlap generates a smooth regge behavior described by a small number of crossed channel regge exchanges .",
    "thus , s - channel resonances are related `` on the average '' to regge exchanges in the t - channel , a feature known as `` semi - local duality '' .",
    "now , data teach us that in the repulsive isospin i=2 @xmath20 scattering channel there are no resonances .",
    "hence , semi - local duality means that the i=2 t - channel amplitude should be small compared with other t - channels .",
    "but the i=2 t - channel can be recast in terms of s - channel amplitudes as : @xmath34 @xmath35 being small .",
    "hence , to have a small @xmath36 requires a strong cancellation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "however , these channels are saturated at low energies by the @xmath39(500 ) and @xmath29(770 ) resonances , respectively .",
    "this `` on the average cancellation '' is properly defined via finite energy sum rules : @xmath40 semi local duality implies @xmath41 , which we have checked to be well satisfied for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we expect the @xmath43 channel to remain repulsive and no resonances to appear even for @xmath44 . as a consequence _ all models where the @xmath14 and the @xmath0 resonances behave differently _ , are in potential conflict with semi - local duality .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite that this conflict actually occurs in those scenarios where the @xmath0 disappears deeply in the complex plane , _ but this conflict is not present when there is a subdominant @xmath5 component in the sigma in the 1 to 1.5 gev region_. the results are summarized in fig.[fig : f3h ] .",
