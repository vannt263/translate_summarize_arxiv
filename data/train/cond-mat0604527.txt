    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dots ( qds ) , created at semiconductor interfaces through the use of lithographic and gate - voltage techniques , with refined control of their size , shape , and number of electrons , are often referred to as `` artificial atoms '' @xcite .",
    "these systems which , with the use of applied magnetic fields , are expected to have future applications as nanoscale logic gates and switching devices , have been in recent years the subject of significant theoretical and experimental research efforts . as indicated above , certain analogies have been made between these man - made systems and their natural counterparts , suggesting that the physics of electrons in the former is similar to that underlying the traditional description of natural atoms  pertaining particularly to electronic shells and the aufbau principle in atoms ( where electrons are taken to be moving in a spherically averaged effective central mean - field potential ) .",
    "the above - mentioned analogy has been theoretically challenged recently @xcite on the basis of calculations that showed evidence for formation , under favorable conditions ( that are readily achieved in the laboratory ) , of `` electron molecules , '' which are alternatively called wigner molecules ( wms ) after the physicist who predicted formation of electron crystals in extended systems @xcite .",
    "these spin - and - space ( ss ) unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) calculations ( denoted in the following as ss - uhf or simply uhf ) of electrons confined in 2d qds by a parabolic external potential led to the discovery of spontaneous symmetry breaking in qds , manifested in the appearance of distinct interelectronic spatial ( crystalline ) correlations ( even in the absence of magnetic fields ) .",
    "such symmetry breaking may indeed be expected to occur based on the interplay between the interelectron repulsion , @xmath4 , and the zero - point kinetic energy , @xmath5 .",
    "it is customary to take @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spatial extent of an electron in the lowest state of the parabolic confinement ; @xmath9 is the electron effective mass , @xmath10 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath11 is the frequency that characterizes the parabolic ( harmonic ) confining potential .",
    "thus , defining the wigner parameter as @xmath12 , one may expect symmetry breaking to occur when the interelectron repulsion dominates , i.e. , for @xmath13 . under such circumstances , an appropriate solution of the schrdinger equation necessitates consideration of wave functions with symmetries that are lower than that of the circularly symmetric qd hamiltonian .",
    "such solutions may be found through the use of the ss - uhf method , where all restrictions on the symmetries of the wave functions are lifted . on the other hand , when @xmath14 , no symmetry breaking is expected , and the ss - uhf solution collapses onto that obtained via the restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) method , and the aforementioned circularly symmetric `` artificial - atom '' analogy maintains . from the above",
    "we note that the state of the system may be controlled and varied through the choice of materials ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) and/or the strength of the confinement ( @xmath11 ) , since @xmath15 .    .",
    "the quantum numbers are @xmath16 with @xmath17 corresponding to the number of radial nodes in the center of mass ( cm ) wavefunction , and @xmath18 is the cm azimuthal quantum number .",
    "the integers @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding quantum numbers for the electrons relative motion ( rm ) and the total energy is given by @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum may be summarized by the `` spectral rule '' given in the figure , with @xmath22 , the phonon stretching vibration @xmath23 , and the phonon for the bending vibration coincides with that of the cm motion , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "all energies are in units of @xmath25 , where @xmath11 is the parabolic confinement frequency . , width=453 ]      to illustrate the formation of `` electron molecules , '' we show first exact results obtained for a two - electron qd , through separation of the center - of - mass and inter - electron relative - distance degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the spectrum obtained for @xmath26 ( fig .  1 )",
    ", exhibits features that are characteristic of a collective rovibrational dynamics , akin to that of a natural `` rigid '' triatomic molecule with an infinitely heavy middle particle representing the center of mass of the dot .",
    "this spectrum transforms to that of a `` floppy '' molecule for smaller value of @xmath27 ( i.e. , for stronger confinements characterized by a larger value of @xmath11 , and/or for weaker inter - electron repulsion ) , ultimately converging to the independent - particle picture associated with the circular central mean - field of the qd .",
    "further evidence for the formation of the electron molecule was found through examination of the conditional probability distribution ( cpd ) ; that is , the anisotropic pair correlation @xmath28 , which expresses the probability of finding a particle at @xmath29 given that the `` observer '' ( reference point ) is riding on another particle at @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 here @xmath32 denotes the many - body wave function under consideration .",
    "it is instructive to note here certain similarities between the formation of a `` two - electron molecule '' in man - made quantum dots , and the collective ( rovibrational ) features observed in the electronic spectrum of doubly - excited helium atoms @xcite .    for confined ( finite ) systems with a larger number of particles",
    ", one must resort to approximate computational schemes . of particular interest",
    "are methodologies that permit systematic evaluation of high - accuracy solutions to these many - body strongly - correlated systems , under field - free conditions , as well as under the influence of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we remark here , that the relatively large ( spatial ) size of qds ( resulting from materials characteristics , e.g. , a small electron effective mass and large dielectric constant ) , allows the full range of orbital magnetic effects to be covered for magnetic fields that are readily attained in the laboratory ( less then 40 t ) .",
    "in contrast , for natural atoms and molecules , magnetic fields of sufficient strength ( i.e. , larger than @xmath33 t ) to produce novel phenomena related to orbital magnetism ( beyond the perturbative regime ) , are known to occur only in astrophysical environments ( e.g. , on the surface of neutron stars ) .",

    "for sufficiently high magnetic field values ( i.e. , in the fractional quantum hall effect , or fqhe , regime ) , the electrons are fully spin - polarized and the zeeman term ( not shown here ) does not need to be considered . in the @xmath37 limit , the external confinement @xmath11 can be neglected , and @xmath38 can be restricted to operate in the lowest landau level ( lll ) , reducing to the form @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cyclotron frequency .    for finite @xmath17 , the solutions to the schrdinger equations corresponding to the hamiltonians given by eq .",

    "we recall that the ss - uhf method relaxes both the double - occupancy requirement ( namely , different spatial orbitals are employed for different spin directions ) , as well as relaxing the requirement that the electron ( spatial ) orbitals be constrained by the symmetry of the external confining potential .    .",

    "this behavior illustrates graphically the meaning of the term restoration of symmetry , and the interpretation that the ss - uhf broken - symmetry solution refers to the intrinsic ( rotating ) frame of reference of the electron molecule . in light of this discussion the final projected state",

    "systematic investigations of qds under high @xmath1 revealed electronic states of crystalline character .",
    "these states are found for particular `` magic '' angular momentum values ( @xmath41 ) that exhibit enhanced stability and are called cusp states . for a given value of @xmath1",
    ", one of these @xmath41 s corresponds to the global minimum , i.e. , the ground state , and varying @xmath1 causes the ground state and its angular momentum to change .",
    "the cusp states have been long recognized @xcite as the finite-@xmath17 precursors of the fractional quantum hall states in extended systems .",
    "in particular , the fractional fillings @xmath67 ( defined in the thermodynamic limit ) are related to the magic angular momenta of the finite-@xmath17 system as follows @xcite @xmath68    in the literature of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , ever since the celebrated paper @xcite by laughlin in 1983 , the cusp states have been considered to be the antithesis of the wigner crystal and to be described accurately by liquid - like wave functions , such as the jastrow- laughlin ( jl ) @xcite and composite - fermion ( cf ) @xcite ones .",
    "this view , however , has been challenged recently @xcite by the explicit derivation of trial wave functions for the cusp states that are associated with a rotating wigner molecule . as discussed elsewhere",
    "@xcite , these parameter - free wave functions , which are by construction crystalline in character , have been shown to provide a simpler and improved description of the cusp states , in particular for high angular momenta ( corresponding to low fractional fillings ) .",
    "the crystalline arrangements that were found @xcite consist of concentric polygonal rings [ see the conditional probabilities displayed in fig .  3 , with the reference ( observation ) point denoted by a filled dot ] .",
    "these rings rotate independently of each other ( see in particular the two cases shown for @xmath69 ) , with the electrons on each ring rotating coherently @xcite .",

    "note in particular the two cpds shown for @xmath69 , illustrating that for a reference point located on the outer ring , the inner ring appears uniform , and vice versa for a reference point located on the inner ring ( bottom row on the right ) .",
    "these results illustrate that the rings rotate independently of each other .",
    ", width=453 ]      in closing this section , we remark that the emergence of crystalline geometric arrangements , discussed above for electrons confined in 2d quantum dots , appears to be a general phenomenon that is predicted @xcite to occur also for trapped bosonic atomic systems ( neutral or charged ) when the interatomic repulsion is tuned to exceed the characteristic energy of the harmonic trap .",
    "indeed , application of the aforementioned two - step method , allowed the evaluation @xcite of solutions to the many - body hamiltonians describing such bosonic systems , going beyond the mean - field ( gross - pitaevskii ) approach .",
    "these highly - correlated trapped 2d states exhibit localization of the bosons into polygonal - ringlike crystalline patterns , thus extending earlier work that predicted localization of strongly repelling 1d bosons ( often referred to as the tonk - girardeau regime @xcite ) , to a higher dimension .",
    "it is expected that these theoretical findings will be the subject of experimental explorations , using methodologies that have led recently to observations of localization transitions in 1d boson systems @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , electron localization leading to formation of molecular - like structures [ the aforementioned wigner molecules ] within a _ single circular _ two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum dot at zero magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) has been theoretically predicted to occur @xcite , as the strength of the @xmath73-@xmath73 repulsive interaction relative to the zero - point energy increases .",
    "of particular interest is a two - electron @xmath74 wm , in light of the current experimental effort @xcite aiming at implementation of a spin - based @xcite solid - state quantum logic gate that employs two coupled one - electron qds ( double dot ) .    here , we present an exact diagonalization ( exd ) and an approximate ( generalized heitler - london , ghl ) microscopic treatment for two electrons in a _ single _",
    "elliptic qd specified by the parameters of a recently investigated experimental device @xcite . while formation of wigner molecules in circular qds requires weak confinement , and thus large dots of lower densities ( so that the interelectron repulsion dominates ) , we show that formation of such wms is markedly enhanced in highly deformed ( e.g. , elliptic ) dots due to their lower symmetry .",
    "the calculations provide a good description of the measured @xmath2 curve ( the singlet - triplet splitting ) when screening @xcite due to the metal gates and leads is included ( in addition to the weakening of the effective inter - electron repulsion due to the dielectric constant of the semiconductor , gaas ) . in particular , our results reproduce the salient experimental findings pertaining to the vanishing of @xmath2 for a finite value of @xmath75 t [ associated with a change in sign of @xmath2 indicating a singlet - triplet ( st ) transition ] , as well as the flattening of the @xmath2 curve after the st crossing . these properties , and in particular the latter one , are related directly to the formation of an electron molecular dimer and its effective dissociation for large magnetic fields .",
    "the effective dissociation of the electron dimer is most naturally described through the ghl approximation , and it is fully supported by the more accurate , but physically less transparent , exd .    of special interest for quantum computing is the degree of entanglement exhibited by the two - electron molecule in its singlet state @xcite . here",
    ", in relation to the microscopic calculations , we investigate two different measures of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the first , known as the concurrence ( @xmath76 ) for two _ indistinguishable _ fermions @xcite , has been used in the analysis of the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite ( this measure is related to the operational cycle of a two - spin - qubit quantum logic gate @xcite ) .",
    "the second measure , referred to as the von neumann entropy ( @xmath77 ) for _ indistinguishable _ particles , has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in ref .",
    "we show that the present _ wave - function - based _ methods , in conjunction with the knowledge of the dot shape and the @xmath2 curve , enable theoretical determination of the degree of entanglement , in particular for the elliptic qd of ref .",
    "the increase in the degree of entanglement ( for both measures ) with stronger magnetic fields correlates with the dissociation of the @xmath78 molecule .",
    "this supports the experimental assertion @xcite that cotunneling spectroscopy can probe properties of the electronic wave function of the qd , and not merely its low - energy spectrum .",
    "our methodology can be straightforwardly applied to other cases of strongly - interacting devices , e.g. , double dots with strong interdot - tunneling .",

    "the ghl method for solving the hamiltoninian ( [ ham ] ) consists of two steps . in the first step , we solve selfconsistently the ensuing unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) equations allowing for lifting of the double - occupancy requirement ( imposing this requirement gives the _ restricted _ hf method , rhf ) .",
    "for the @xmath92 solution , this step produces two single - electron orbitals @xmath93 that are localized left @xmath94 and right @xmath95 of the center of the qd [ unlike the rhf method that gives a single doubly - occupied elliptic ( and symmetric about the origin ) orbital ] . at this step",

    "we restore the broken parity and total - spin symmetries by applying to the uhf determinant the projection operator @xcite @xmath102 , where the operator @xmath103 interchanges the spins of the two electrons [ this is a special case of the operator given in eq .
