    "the metric fixed point theory ( @xcite ) and its variations ( @xcite ) are far - reaching developments of banach s contraction principle , where _ metric conditions _ on the underlying space and maps under consideration play a fundamental role .",
    "this paper addresses fixed points of nonlinear maps in _ modular spaces _ introduced recently by the author ( @xcite@xcite ) as generalizations of orlicz spaces and classical modular spaces ( @xcite , @xcite@xcite ) , where _ modular structures _ ( involving nonlinearities with more rapid growth than power - like functions ) , play the crucial role . under different contractive assumptions and the supplementary @xmath1-condition on modulars fixed",
    "point theorems in classical modular linear spaces were established in  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a certain motivation of the definition of a ( metric ) _ modular _ , introduced axiomatically in @xcite . a simple and natural way to do it is to turn to physical interpretations . informally speaking , whereas a metric on a set represents nonnegative finite distances between any two points of the set , a modular on a set attributes a nonnegative ( possibly , infinite valued ) `` field of ( generalized ) velocities '' : to each `` time '' @xmath2 ( the absolute value of ) an average velocity @xmath3 is associated in such a way that in order to cover the `` distance '' between points @xmath4 it takes time @xmath5 to move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with velocity @xmath3 .",
    "let us comment on this in more detail by exhibiting an appropriate example .",
    "if @xmath8 is the distance from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and a number @xmath2 is interpreted as time , then the  value @xmath9 is the average velocity , with which one should move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 during time @xmath5 , in order to cover the distance @xmath10 .",
    "the following properties of the quantity from ( [ e : dxy ] ) are quite natural .",
    "\\(i ) two points @xmath6 and @xmath7 from @xmath11 coincide ( and @xmath12 ) if and only if any time @xmath13 will do to move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with velocity @xmath14 ( i.e. , no movement is needed at any time ) .",
    "formally , given @xmath4 , we have : @xmath15 where ` iff ' means as usual ` if and only if ' .",
    "\\(ii ) assuming the distance function to be symmetric , @xmath16 , we find that for any time @xmath13 the average velocity during the movement from @xmath6 to @xmath7 is the same as the average velocity in the opposite direction , i.e. , for any @xmath4 we have : @xmath17    \\(iii ) the third property of ( [ e : dxy ] ) , which is , in a sense , a counterpart of the triangle inequality ( for velocities ! ) , is the most important .",
    "suppose the movement from @xmath6 to @xmath7 happens to be made in two different ways , but the _ duration of time is the same _ in each case : ( a ) passing through a third point @xmath18 , or ( b ) straightforward from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath5 is the time needed to get from @xmath6 to @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the time needed to get from @xmath19 to @xmath7 , then the corresponding average velocities are @xmath21 ( during the movement from @xmath6 to @xmath19 ) and @xmath22 ( during the movement from @xmath19 to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the total time needed for the movement in the case ( a ) is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "thus , in order to move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 as in the case ( b ) one has to have the average velocity equal to @xmath24 . since ( as a rule ) the straightforward distance @xmath10 does not exceed the sum of the distances @xmath25 , it becomes clear from the physical intuition that the velocity @xmath24 does not exceed at least one of the velocities @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",

    "setting @xmath38 ( note that @xmath39 in ( [ e : dxy ] ) ) , we have @xmath40    a nonclassical example of `` generalized velocities '' satisfying ( [ e : axi])([e : axi3 ] ) is given by : @xmath41 if @xmath42 , and @xmath14 if @xmath43 .",

    "the difference between a metric ( = distance function ) and a modular on a set is now clearly seen : a modular depends on a positive parameter and may assume infinite values ; the latter property means that it is impossible ( or prohibited ) to move from @xmath6 to @xmath7 in time @xmath5 , unless one moves with infinite velocity @xmath41 .",
    "in addition ( cf .",
    "( [ e : dxy ] ) ) , the `` velocity '' @xmath3 is _ nonincreasing _ as a function of `` time '' @xmath13 .",
