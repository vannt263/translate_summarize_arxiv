    "in modeling of binary populations , most interacting mass - transferring binary systems are assumed to be circular ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , observations reveal that semi - detached binary systems might have non - zero orbital eccentricities . in addition , recent observations indicate that high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) are eccentric , with relatively high eccentricities in the case of be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the residual eccentricity that has been observed in mass - transferring binary systems is quite surprising , since tidal dissipation might be expected to circularize the orbit and drive the star towards co - rotation .",
    "this implies that the efficiency of tidal circularization in interacting eccentric binaries is not as high as typically assumed .",
    "previous work has shown that especially for long - period systems and solar - type binaries in open clusters tides are not sufficient to circularize the orbit , leaving the systems with a considerable non - zero eccentricity .",
    "possible mechanisms that have been proposed to help the system retain a finite eccentricity are mass - loss and mass - transfer processes .    mass - loss / transfer can indeed enhance eccentricity and is a common evolutionary phase in a binary system , being responsible for many observed astrophysical phenomena such as type ia supernovae , x - ray binaries , neutron - stars spin up as well as orbital contraction or expansion .",
    "mass can be ejected or accreted in a binary system in many different and complicated ways and is phase - dependent in an eccentric orbit .",
    "commonly studied cases include isotropic wind mass - loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , roche - lobe - overflow ( rlof ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bondi - hoyle accretion .",
    "all the aforementioned processes change the total mass , energy and orbital angular momentum of the binary , which corresponds to a change in the binary orbital elements .",
    "the effect of mass - transfer on the orbital elements of the orbit goes back a while ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and continues to recent years with work studying various and different cases of mass - loss and mass - transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the existing literature , to our knowledge ,",
    "the time - evolution of the orbital elements of a binary undergoing mass - loss and mass - transfer has been derived following two different approaches .",
    "one involves calculating time variations of the orbital elements based on changes in the total orbital energy and angular momentum of the system .",
    "the other is treating mass - loss / transfer as a perturbation in the two - body problem and using the latter to calculate the time - evolution of the orbital elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , consistency between these two different approaches is not always clear and many assumptions that have implicitly been made following either technique are not always clearly stated .",
    "thus , having a general mathematical formalism to describe the orbital evolution of a binary system undergoing mass - transfer of various types is both useful and important in binary evolution theory . in the first part of this paper",
    ", we present how to derive the time - evolution equations of the orbital elements based on the lagrange perturbation formalism ( lagrange @xmath0 ) and then apply this to specific cases of mass - loss and mass - transfer in eccentric binaries .",
    "a binary system exposed to different kind of perturbations follows an orbit that is continuously evolving in time , i.e. , an open orbit .",
    "this means that much attention must be paid to the physical interpretation of the orbital elements we assign to the evolving orbit . in this work",
    ", we refer to the importance of this interpretation which is connected both to the freedom in the choice of orbital elements and the gauge freedom in orbital mechanics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the general formalism we use to describe the perturbed two - body problem . in section 3",
    "we comment on the importance of the choice of reference frame and present the time - evolution equations of the orbital elements in three different reference frames . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we apply this formalism to the cases of isotropic and anisotropic wind mass - loss respectively . in section 6",
    "we study conservative as well as non - conservative non - isotropic mass ejection and accretion in the system for extended binary components . in section 7",
    "we present the form the time - evolution equations of the orbital elements reduce to under the point - mass approximation . throughout all the aforementioned sections ,",
    "comparison to previous work in the literature that has considered similar cases is made .",
    "finally , an explanation of any existing discrepancies is provided . in section 8",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the perturbing acceleration is in principle phase - dependent . in this paper ,",
    "we present the general form of the perturbing acceleration and the orbital element time - evolution equations , keeping this phase - dependence . in a follow - up paper dosopoulou",
    "@xmath1 kalogera 2016b ( from now on paper ii ) , we orbit - average the phase - dependent time - evolution equations of the orbital elements relevant to different types of mass - loss / transfer in the binary under either the assumption of adiabaticity or for delta - function mass - loss / transfer at periastron .",
    "two - body systems like binary stars can be exposed to gravitational perturbations from different agents .",
    "these include tidal dissipation , relativistic corrections , gravitational - wave radiation , magnetic fields , inertial forces , mass - loss / mass - transfer phenomena and other .",
    "all these physical processes act like perturbing forces to the general two - body problem and need a new mathematical way of treatment compared to the unperturbed case . due to the various perturbations ,",
    "each body is no longer moving in the actual physical trajectory ( conic section ) it would if no perturbations existed , but its physical orbit is slowly changing with time .    either called _ variation of constants _ in pure mathematical language or _ varying - conic method _ in purely geometric terms ,",
    "the method that was proposed to study these systems was advanced and completed by lagrange .",
    "this method involves an approximation of the true physical orbit by a family of evolving instantaneous conic sections .    in subsection @xmath2 , we will prove that the latter representation is not unique , thus one should be very meticulous when applying this mathematical formulation . specifically , the actual physical orbit of the body is open , the orbital elements derived though this method are not the classic orbital elements of a closed orbit . rather , they either can have a possible physical interpretation under certain assumptions or they should be treated just as mathematical tools otherwise.we shall discuss this issue in more detail in the next sections .",
    "the general reduced two - body problem is described by the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the total mass of the system and @xmath6 is the relative position between the two bodies .",
    "the general solution to this problem is a keplerian conic section defined by six constant orbital elements @xmath7 .    in a specified inertial coordinate system , this conic is described by @xmath8 where by definition @xmath9 is the relative velocity between the two bodies in the system .",
    "the _ perturbed _ two - body problem can then be written as @xmath10 where the perturbing force @xmath11 depends upon both the relative position and velocity .",
    "equation @xmath12 can be solved assuming that at each instant of time , the true orbit can be approximated by an instantaneous keplerian conic section which is changing over time through the now _ time - dependent _ orbital elements @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 and the velocity of the body will now be given by @xmath15 equations @xmath12 and @xmath16 constitute a system of three independent equations , one independent variable ( time @xmath17 ) and six dependent variables ( orbital elements @xmath18 ) .",
    "this means that the parametrization in terms of the orbital elements is not unique and additional constraints need to be applied .",
    "imposing the _ lagrange constraint _ @xmath19 makes the orbital elements @xmath18 _ osculating_. this means that the instantaneous conics are tangential to the perturbed actual physical orbit , as it can be seen by equation @xmath20 and is also depicted in figure @xmath21 .",
    "another way to think about osculating orbits is that these are the orbits that the body would follow if perturbations were to cease instantaneously .",
    "equations @xmath12,@xmath22 and @xmath20 constitute now a well - defined system of six equations and six variables .    following the lagrange constraint , the perturbed equation of motion @xmath12",
    "can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 refers to the solution of the unperturbed two - body problem , i.e. , satisfies equation @xmath25 .",
    "this simplifies equation @xmath26 to @xmath27 which using the definition of lagrange and poisson brackets can be decoupled to read @xmath28    poisson brackets are defined by @xmath29 they are the negative inverse to lagrange brackets @xmath30= \\frac{\\partial{\\bold{r}}}{\\partial{c_{k}}}\\frac{\\partial{\\bold{v}}}{\\partial{c_{i}}}-\\frac{\\partial{\\bold{r}}}{\\partial{c_{i}}}\\frac{\\partial{\\bold{v}}}{\\partial{c_{k}}},\\ ] ] and do not depend on time explicitly .",
    "equations @xmath31 give the time - evolution equations of the six osculating orbital elements , which are invariant with respect to the change of coordinates and/or orbital parametrization .",
    "we choose the six keplerian elements @xmath32 , namely semi - major axis , eccentricity , inclination , argument of periapsis , longitude of the ascending node , and true anomaly @xmath33 .",
    "also , we define @xmath34 as the mean motion .",

    "equations @xmath37-@xmath38 describe the time - evolution of all the six orbital elements . because in this paper we are interested only in perturbations induced by mass - loss / transfer processes and for reasons we describe in detail in the last paragraph of the following section , in this paper we present only the time - evolution of the semi - major axis @xmath39 and the eccentricity @xmath40 [ see equations @xmath37 and @xmath41 .",

    "choosing the lagrange constraint @xmath59 , one enforces the family of the approximating conics to be always tangent to the physical orbit of the body . in other words",
    ", this means that the orbital elements under this constraint are osculating elements and describe the conic the body would follow if the perturbation ceased instantaneously .",
    "any other non - zero constraint @xmath44 would lead to orbital elements that do not describe conics that are tangential to the real orbit , but differ from the tangent velocity vector by @xmath44 [ see figure 2 ] .",
    "these elements are the so - called _ non - osculating _ elements and can be used in some cases as useful mathematical tools to describe the problem ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is obvious that a real physical interpretation can be assigned only to the osculating elements ( lagrange constraint ) , since only those describe conics that are always and at any time tangent to the actual path of the body .",
    "we should point out here that even the osculating orbital elements derived by this formulation are mathematical tools that can be used to approximately describe the real trajectory of the body .",

    "the time - evolution equations for the osculating orbital elements include periodic terms that describe the natural oscillations these elements undergo due to the periodicity of the orbit .",
    "when the change in the orbital elements over one orbit is small , then an orbit - averaged method can be adopted to smooth out these oscillations leading to the secular ( orbit - averaged ) osculating orbital elements .",
    "in addition , if the perturbation timescale is much longer than the orbital timescale then these secular time - evolution equations can be resolved into a simpler form .",
    "the regime where a perturbation is changing slowly throughout the orbit so that it can be considered constant over an orbit ( i.e. , an  adiabatic invariant \" ) is called the adiabatic regime . in this regime",
    "adiabatic \" secular time - evolution equations for the osculating orbital elements are valid .",
    "when the orbital period becomes gradually comparable to the perturbation timescale , then adiabaticity is broken and the ",
    "adiabatic \" secular time - evolution equations no longer apply . @xcite studied the oscillations of the osculating orbital elements in the case of mass - loss in the adiabatic regime as well as in the regime following the breaking of adiabaticity .",
    "when applying equations @xmath37 and @xmath47 or alternatively @xmath61 and @xmath53 to any kind of problem , one needs to know the various partial derivatives of @xmath51 and @xmath52 with respect to the orbital elements .",

    "based on what we presented here there are two ways one can derive the time - evolution equations of the orbital elements .",
    "one is using the perturbing force @xmath45 directly applying the osculating equations @xmath37 and @xmath47 and the other is using the equivalent lagrangian @xmath63 defined by equation @xmath64 and applying equations @xmath61 and @xmath53 .",
    "although these two different approaches are completely equivalent eventually leading to the same equations for the osculating orbital elements , the second method which makes use of the lagrangian is more general because it introduces the gauge freedom .",
    "this means that the latter is the only method one could use to choose a gauge different than zero .",
    "there are cases where the use of a gauge other than zero is needed , e.g. , when the delaunay variables need to remain canonical for a general perturbation depending both on positions and velocities of the bodies .    in the next sections",
    ", we will apply the gauge - free method to derive and compare the orbital element time - evolution equations between a zero - gauge and a different gauge @xmath44 , called the _ generalized lagrange constraint _",

    "we discuss the importance of the reference frame choice pointing out that a vanishing component of the perturbing force in one specific reference frame does not guarantee any other vanishing component of the perturbing force in a different reference frame [ see the rotation matrices @xmath66-@xmath67 .",

    "these components depend only on the relative velocity of the ejected or accreted matter to the motion of the mass - loosing or accreting body .    in this section we derived the phase - dependent time - evolution equations of the orbital elements for non - conservative mass - transfer assuming point masses . in paper",
    "ii we orbit - average these equations and derive the secular time - evolution equations of the orbital elements under the point - mass approximation and for some commonly used characteristic examples of mass - loss / transfer in the adiabatic regime .",
    "motivated by observations of many mass - transferring eccentric binary systems , in this paper we derive self - consistent equations for the orbital evolution of interacting eccentric binaries .",
    "we presented a general formalism to derive the time - evolution equations of the orbital elements of a binary exposed to general perturbations .",
    "we applied this formalism to the case of mass - loss and mass - transfer in a binary , treating the latter as perturbations to the general two - body problem .",
    "we first discussed the cases of isotropic and anisotropic wind mass - loss .",
    "we then studied the general case of non - isotropic ejection and accretion in conservative as well as non - conservative manner for both point masses and extended bodies .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized below :    * we discussed the physical interpretation of the osculating orbital elements within the context of gauge freedom in celestial mechanics .",
    "we presented two different ways to derive the phase - dependent time - evolution equations of the orbital elements and commented on the advantages of each method .",
    "* we pointed out the importance of the choice of reference frame since an incorrect treatment can lead to misinterpretations of the orbital evolution of the system .",
    "we derived the phase - dependent time - evolution equations of the semi - major axis and eccentricity in three different reference frames pointing out the importance of using the right set of time - evolution equations for the chosen reference frame . comparing with other work in the literature we presented the necessary corrections that have to be made so that the chosen set of time - evolution equations of the orbital elements is consistent with the chosen reference frame in the problem .",
    "* we studied for completeness the case of isotropic wind mass - loss .",
    "we verified that for isotropic mass - loss , the semi - major axis as well as the periastron position can never decrease throughout the orbit . on the contrary",
    ", the eccentricity undergoes oscillations on orbital time - scales .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is proportional to the ratio of the orbital period to the mass - loss timescale and increases over time .",
    "* we considered the case of anisotropic wind mass - loss . under the assumption of phase - independent anisotropic wind mass - loss",
    "the orbital evolution depends on the velocity and structure of the stellar wind along the surface and relative to the center - of - mass of the mass - losing body . by making use of the correct transformation treatment between different reference frames that we described in a previous section",
    ", we have presented the correct set of time - evolution equations of the orbital elements that are necessary to study the case of anisotropic wind mass - loss . * for either the case of conservative or non - conservative mass - transfer for extended bodies we derived the phase - dependent time - evolution equations of the osculating orbital elements .",
    "the mass - transfer effect on the semi - major axis and eccentricity depends strongly on the binary characteristics and is proportional to the mass - loss and mass accretion rates . the mass - transfer may either increase or decrease the eccentricity in contrast to tides which always act to circularize the orbit . in the case of extended bodies , the relative ejection and accretion points and associated velocities",
    "play an important role as well .",
    "furthermore , in the case of non - conservative mass - transfer there is a strong dependence on the fraction of the total orbital angular momentum the lost mass removes from the system , which in all cases remains a free parameter . *",
    "the point - mass assumption is often the first approximation to be made in problems regarding mass - transfer in binary systems .",
    "we presented the form of the time - evolution equations of the orbital elements in the non - conservative non - isotropic ejection and accretion case for point masses .",
    "we concluded by pointing out the remaining dependence on the relative velocity of the ejected / accreted mass to the motion of the mass - losing / accreting body .    in paper ii ,",
    "we orbit - average the general phase - dependent time - evolution equations of the orbital elements presented in this paper .",
    "we do that under the assumption of either adiabaticity or delta - function mass - loss / transfer at periastron and for all the different types of mass - loss / transfer studied here .",
    "the secular ( orbit - averaged ) time - evolution equations for the semi - major axis and eccentricity are useful analytical equations that can be used to model the evolution of interacting eccentric binaries in star and binary evolution codes like startrack @xcite , bse @xcite or mesa @xcite .",
