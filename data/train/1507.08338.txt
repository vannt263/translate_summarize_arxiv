    "the _ pseudoachromatic number _ of a graph @xmath15 , which is the number of colours in a maximum complete vertex - colouring of @xmath16 , has attracted the attention of several researchers since its introduction by gupta @xcite in 1969 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "being a hard parametre to calculate , it is in order to search for bounds in general classes of graphs . in this series of papers @xcite ,",
    "we endeavour to calculate the exact value of the _ pseudoachromatic index _ of the complete graph @xmath17 , for a wide set of values of @xmath18 ( see also @xcite ) , which we denote by @xmath19    more precisely , on the one hand we study in detail the interaction of a couple of natural upper bounds for @xmath20 in terms of the size of chromatic classes in a complete edge colouring of @xmath17 ; namely , if @xmath21 is the size of its smallest chromatic class , then ( cf . , @xcite ) @xmath22 each of these bounds by themselves does not give much information of the phenomena , but together they seem to dominate precisely what is going on . therefore , we study those intervals of values of @xmath18 where each of these bounds dominates the phenomena ; viz . , denoting by @xmath23 it will be proven the following    [ cor3 ] if @xmath24 is an integer , then @xmath25    on the other hand , using results given in @xcite and supported by the combinatorial structure of projective planes of even order , we exhibit optimal complete edge colourings of @xmath17 ; we show that    [ teo1 ] let @xmath26 be an even natural number , and let @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if the projective plane @xmath0 of order @xmath1 exists then @xmath30    with these results together , we obtain the following set of exact values for the pseudoachromatic index of the complete graph    [ cor2 ] let @xmath31 be a power of @xmath32 , let @xmath27 , @xmath33 and @xmath29 , then @xmath34",
    "in order to give the proof we will use the following proposition ( see @xcite ) .    [ prop1 ]",
    "if @xmath24 is an integer , then @xmath35    let @xmath36 an integer and let @xmath37 . by proposition [ prop1 ] , we already know that @xmath38 .",

    "let @xmath41 be a complete colouring .",
    "first of all we will prove that any class of colour can not have less than @xmath21 edges .",
    "suppose there exists a colour class @xmath42 with @xmath43 edges such that @xmath44 , then @xmath42 will be adjacent to at most @xmath45 edges , but @xmath46 , in consequence @xmath42 could not be adjacent to all other colour classes . then , each colour class has at least @xmath21 edges .",
    "suppose now that there exists a colour class @xmath42 with exactly @xmath21 edges .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath42 is adjacent to exactly @xmath47 other edges and also they must all have different colours , otherwise @xmath42 does not meet all the other colour classes note that the only way to get this is when c is a matching .",
    "since each colour class has at least @xmath21 edges , then the number of colour classes with more than @xmath21 edges is at most @xmath48 , hence , there are at least @xmath49 colour classes with @xmath50 edges .",
    "now we will see that there are at least two colour classes of size @xmath21 .",
    "for this just observe that    @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , which is equivalent to @xmath55 for some @xmath56 and then @xmath57 \\cap \\ { 4x^2-x,\\dots,4x^2 + 3x-3 \\}=\\ { 4x^2-x,\\dots,4x^2 + 3x-3\\}\\ ] ]    let @xmath42 be a colour class of size @xmath21 .",
    "this class is a matching with @xmath58 vertices and @xmath59 edges in the induced subgraph @xmath60 that are not in @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , each one of these edges has a different colour and each one of these colours is in a class with more than @xmath21 edges because they are adjacent to two edges of @xmath42 .",
