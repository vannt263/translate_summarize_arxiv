    "[ intro ]    recently , there was an essential resurrection of interest in statistical properties of zeros of random polynomials and random analytic functions @xcite@xcite .",
    "the distribution of real roots for random polynomials was studied in classical papers by bloch and polya  @xcite , littlewood and offord  @xcite , kac  @xcite and many others .",
    "many results and an overview of the field is given in the recent monograph by farahmand @xcite .    as is well - known , for the case of algebraic polynomials @xmath8 where the real coefficients @xmath3 are independently and identically distributed around mean zero , the roots are mostly located near @xmath9 .",
    "a natural intuitive picture for such an accumulation was proposed by kac . indeed ,",
    "if all coefficients @xmath3 are of the same order then only for @xmath10 will the terms have a good chance to interact and cancel each other producing zero .    in particular , for gaussian - distributed coefficients with mean @xmath11=0 $ ] and variance @xmath12=\\sigma$ ] ,",
    "the mean density of real zeros of an algebraic polynomial @xmath13 is given by the kac formula @xmath14 where @xmath15    usually , one is interested in the limit of polynomials of high degree @xmath2 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath16 the density is given by : @xmath17 and @xmath18^{1/2}\\ ] ] the expected number of real zeros is known to have the following asymptotics : @xmath19 where the leading logarithmic term was found by kac himself , and the corrections , in particular , the constant @xmath20\\,dv\\right\\}\\ ] ] was found by wilkins  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic result @xmath21 was proven to be very universal , i.e. insensitive to the details of the distribution of coefficients @xmath3 , see discussion and further references in @xcite .",
    "a similar universality result is also available for the variance of the total number of real zeros  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the informal arguments by kac suggests that close to the values @xmath1 many random terms of comparable magnitude add up to form the polynomial , and the emerging object should be universal in the spirit of the central limit theorem .",
    "another natural question arises about the expected number of real zeros for coefficients with a nonvanishing mean value * e*@xmath22=\\mu$ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to include the mean value to the standard derivation of the kac formula for gaussian - distributed coefficients and arrive at the following expression : @xmath23 } \\int_0^{\\infty } dq\\;q \\cosh{\\left(q\\sqrt{\\sigma_1(t)}\\right ) } e^{-\\frac{q^2}{2}}\\\\\\ & & \\sigma_1(t)=\\frac{a_n(t ) d^2_n(t)}{a_n(t)c_n(t)-b_n^2(t)}\\quad,\\quad \\sigma_2(t)=\\frac{g^2_n(t)}{a_n(t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined in ( [ kac ] ) .",
    "earlier investigation  @xcite has revealed that any , whatever small , mean value @xmath27 asymptotically , for large @xmath2 , kills exactly half of real zeros and converts the above quoted result [ kacasy ] for their number into @xmath28 .",
    "it is this surprising abruptness that motivated us to have a closer look at the origin of such a behavior .",
    "this question turned out to be also related to exploring the appropriately scaled vicinity of the accumulation points .",
    "it is quite clear ( and can be verified numerically ) that the root density function @xmath13 as well as its limiting form ( [ limtriv ] ) are both not universal . on other hand , the essence of the kac argument discussed above and the mentioned universality of @xmath29 suggests that universal features have to emerge in close vicinity of the accumulation points @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to understand that the relevant vicinity of @xmath10 is of the order of @xmath30 for large degree @xmath2 .",
    "we will refer to such domain as the _ local scaling regime _ , as opposed to keeping the distance @xmath31 from the accumulation points @xmath1 fixed in the limit @xmath32 , the latter regime being referred to as the _ global _ one . in particular , our main goal is to verify proposition  [ asyprop ] .",
    "[ asyprop ] let coefficients @xmath33 of a random polynomial @xmath34 be i.i.d real random variables with @xmath35=\\mu_n>0 $ ] and finite variance chosen to be unity : @xmath36=1 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath37 be the number of real zeros of @xmath34 in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , with @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40=\\int_{x_1}^{x_2 } p_{\\alpha}(v )",
    "\\ , dv\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and the density function @xmath42 is given by @xmath43    a similar statement is valid for the vicinity of second accumulation point @xmath44 for @xmath45 .    here",
    "we present explicit arguments in favour of the validity of such a proposition for the simplest case @xmath46 .",
    "the local regime formula ( [ scaleden ] ) reduces in that case to the following simple expression : @xmath47 the modifications required to include nonzero mean @xmath48 are self - evident and left to the reader .",
    "our starting formula is the following representation for the number of real roots @xmath37 of @xmath34 in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50\\ ] ] stands for the joint probability density of the random polynomial @xmath34 and its derivative over @xmath16",
    ". let us introduce in the above representation the scaling variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 by relations :",
    "@xmath54 changing the variables of integration one finds : @xmath55 where @xmath56\\,.\\ ] ]    evidently each of the scaled random variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a sum of @xmath2 independent , although not identically distributed terms , with the magnitude of fluctuations of each term depending on the summation index @xmath57 . calculating the variances of the scaled variables we find that they are given by @xmath58= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1 } ( 1-v / n)^{2j}=\\frac{1-(1-v / n)^{2n}}{v(2-v / n)}\\ ] ] and @xmath59=\\frac{1}{n^2 } \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1",

    "we infer that the limiting joint probability density @xmath67 of the scaled variables @xmath52 & @xmath53 tends when @xmath32 to the normal law with variances @xmath68 and covariance @xmath69 , as if the polynomial coefficients were normal with unit variance .",
    "therefore , the kac formula for the density of real roots should be asymptotically valid in this case , and the formula eq.([zeromean ] ) immediately follows after substituting those limiting values into the kac expression eq.([kac ] ) .",
    "separation of the two regimes and identification of the scaling is in some sense similar to _ local _ versus _",
    "global _ scaling regimes in spectra of random matrices . only when the spectral parameters are scaled appropriately will the various correlation functions characterising the eigenvalues of large random matrices show a surprisingly robust universality @xcite .",
    "although the expressions eq.([scaleden ] ) , and especially eq.([zeromean ] ) look very natural ( cf .",
    "the structure of the asymptotic result eq.([kacasy ] ) ) and their universality stems from such basic fact as the central limit theorem , we failed to trace a similar statement in the available literature on random polynomials with real coefficients .",
    "for complex zeros a kind of local regime was studied in much detail by shepp & vanderbei  @xcite and ibragimov & zeitouni  @xcite who showed that those zeros tend to concentrate asymptotically on the unit circle . only very recently ( squared )",
    "expression of the type ( [ zeromean ] ) independently emerged in studies of complex zeros of polynomials with complex i.i.d .",
    "coefficients , see shiffman and zelditch , @xcite .",
    "a different kind of universality results was addressed in a very recent paper @xcite which appeared when the present paper was under completion .",
    "it is interesting and informative to have a look at the profiles of the real root density in the _",
    "local scaling regime _ around the point @xmath70 ( i.e @xmath71 ) for some typical values of the parameters , and compare them with the results of numerical simulations . in fig .",
    "( [ gausspics ] ) we plotted the density profiles obtained by a direct numerical search for real roots of polynomials with gaussian - distributed coefficients for degrees @xmath72 , @xmath73 & @xmath74 .",
    "the ( scaled ) mean value @xmath75 of the coefficients was chosen to be @xmath76 and the variance was always kept unity .",
    "the results can be compared with both the exact predictions of the kac - type formula ( [ kac1 ] ) for the same values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and with the asymptotic universal profile of ( [ scaleden ] ) .",
    "realisations of random polynomials .",

    "[ gausspics],title=\"fig : \" ]   realisations of random polynomials .",
    "[ gausspics],title=\"fig : \" ]    it is trivial to see that as @xmath2 increases the exact kac - like expression begins to coincide with the asymptotic profile , and the analytical curve agrees well with the numerical data . to verify universality we also performed numerical simulations for the case of coefficients uniformly distributed in the interval of the widths @xmath79 around the same mean values @xmath48 .",

    "each data set corresponds to @xmath80 realisations of random polynomials.,title=\"fig : \" ]    one can notice a couple of interesting features .",
    "first simple observation is that the exact kac formulae are asymmetric about @xmath71 for small @xmath2 ( in the _",
    "local regime _ ) but it becomes `` asymptotically symmetric '' with increasing @xmath2 , as predicted by ( [ scaleden ] ) .",
    "this feature is easy to understand in view of the global inversion symmetry @xmath81 which holds exactly for all polynomials with i.i.d .",
    "coefficients . in the local regime",
    "close to accumulation points this symmetry implies the asymptotic reflection symmetry @xmath82 .",
    "the most surprising feature is a non - trivial double - peak structure of the density profile , and it deserves to be discussed in more detail .",
    "in fact , it turns out that as @xmath83 increases the shape of the density profile described by formula ( [ scaleden ] ) changes from that with one maximum to that with two symmetric maxima as illustrated in the fig .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .     from @xmath84",
    "to @xmath85 for a degree 100 polynomial.[alpha],title=\"fig : \" ]   from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for a degree 100 polynomial.[alpha],title=\"fig : \" ]   from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for a degree 100 polynomial.[alpha],title=\"fig : \" ]   from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for a degree 100 polynomial.[alpha],title=\"fig : \" ]   from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for a degree 100 polynomial.[alpha],title=\"fig : \" ]   from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for a degree 100 polynomial.[alpha],title=\"fig : \" ]    this fact can be verified analytically by considering the small-@xmath51 expansion : @xmath86\\ ] ] valid for @xmath87 .",
    "we see that for @xmath88 the local maximum at @xmath71 is converted to a minimum . on the other hand , for @xmath89 we easily find from eq.([scaleden ] ) the @xmath90independent far tail decay law @xmath91 which ensures that at least two symmetric maxima have to appear at @xmath92 .",
    "notice that the far tail values are much larger for @xmath93 than the exponentially small density @xmath94 at the origin , and thus the maxima have to be quite pronounced .",
    "the precise reason for such a nonmonotonous behavior is not clear to us at the moment , and deserve further investigations .",
    "we consider that feature as an indication of a rather nontrivial statistics of zeros accumulating in the scaling region around the points @xmath9 .",
    "fixing the value of @xmath95 and performing the limit @xmath32 amounts to letting @xmath96 .",
    "this results in vanishing density of the real roots @xmath97 for any fixed @xmath51 .",
    "this fact corresponds to observed suppression of exactly half of the real zeros ( the vicinity of the second accumulation point is not at all affected by the nonvanishing mean @xmath48 ) .",
    "in contrast , correctly tuning the mean value with the parameter @xmath2 by letting @xmath6 and magnifying the vicinity of the accumulation point via the correct scaling @xmath98 results in a density function ( [ scaleden ] ) and thus describes a gradual ( as opposed to abrupt ) suppression of real zeros in the scaling regime , see fig .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "let us now briefly discuss open questions and perspectives for further research .",
    "a very interesting development of the theory of random polynomials comes from the paper by bleher and di  @xcite .",
    "the authors discovered nontrivial correlations between positions of real zeros of algebraic polynomials .",
    "the correlations can be conveniently characterised by correlation functions of the polynomial zeros : @xmath99\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the number of real zeros of the polynomial @xmath101 in the interval @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "the consideration of correlation functions studied by bleher and di was restricted , in our terminology , to the global regime. it should be possible to derive local regime formulae for those quantities .",
    "the expressions are expected to be universal in the same sense as the local regime formula for expected number of roots , eqs .",
    "( [ th1 ] , [ scaleden ] ) .",
    "the simplest nontrivial quantity of that type should be the variance @xmath103}$ ] of the number of real roots in the vicinity of @xmath70 .",
    "another natural object to study is the variation of the number of real polynomial roots against a small change of the vector of real coefficients @xmath104 .",
    "more specifically , change @xmath105 assuming the components of the vector @xmath106 to be i.i.d .",
    "standard gaussian .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 is used here to control the magnitude of the perturbation . by using @xmath108 to denote the perturbed polynomial an interesting question arises",
    ", that is can we generalize the correlation functions eq.([bleh ] ) to the following _ parametric _ correlation functions : @xmath109\\ ] ] which reflects the change in the positions of the real roots .",
    "similar objects are of interest in the theory of random matrices and disordered systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    as a preliminary step of our research we evaluated the simplest nontrivial parametric correlation function , following the paper  @xcite and found in the local regime : @xmath110 ^ 2}= 1+\\frac{1}{v}\\arcsin{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+v^2}}}\\ ] ]",
    "it will be interesting to attack the problem in full generality , both for global and especially for local regime , where the results are expected to be universal .",
    "in fact , our initial interest in the properties of random polynomials was stimulated by the fact that closely related methods can be applied to study the properties of irregular eigenfunctions in quantum billiards. the eigenfunctions @xmath111 at the point with the coordinate vector @xmath112 are solutions of the helmholtz equation : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a connected compact domain with the boundary @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the laplacian .",
    "recently smilansky and collaborators  @xcite suggested looking for the eigenfunctions at the point @xmath117 in the following representation : @xmath118 where @xmath119 stands for the bessel functions , @xmath120 are polar coordinates of the observation point , and the integer @xmath121 is given in terms of the wavenumber @xmath122 and the perimeter @xmath123 of the billiard boundary @xmath115 as @xmath124 $ ] .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath125 satisfying @xmath126 are taken to be i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian variables with unit variance , in accordance to the berry s conjecture . based on such a formula the authors of @xcite managed to calculate the mean number @xmath127 and variance @xmath128 of the intersection of nodal lines with the billiard boundary @xmath115 . for the dirichlet boundary conditions along the boundary curve @xmath129 parameterised as @xmath130 , with @xmath131 , the problem turned out to be equivalent to counting the number of real zeros of the function @xmath132 in the interval @xmath133 .",
    "those developments provide an interesting possibility for applying ideas and methods from the theory of random polynomials to describe chaotic eigenfunctions .",
    "similar methods can be hopefully used to study sensitivity of the nodal lines of eigenfunctions of quantum billiards with respect to the perturbation of the billiard parameters .",
    "for example , one may wish to study parametric variations of the quantities involved , with the role of the external parameter played by a slight random variation of the boundary curve @xmath130 or by any other tunable physical parameter .",
