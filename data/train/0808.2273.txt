    "the spectrum was extracted using a 5-pixel extraction aperture and calibrated using the procedure and calibration files described in lu et al .",

    "<S> mips sed - mode observation of hd181327 , an f5/f6v member of the @xmath212 myr old @xmath3 pictoris moving group . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve the disk in thermal - emission for the first time and find that the northern arm of the disk is 1.4@xmath4 brighter than the southern arm . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we detect a broad peak in the combined _ spitzer _ irs and mips spectra at 60 -75 @xmath1 m that may be produced by emission from crystalline water ice . </S>",
    "<S> we model the irs and mips data using a size distribution of amorphous olivine and water ice grains ( @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 with @xmath8 consistent with the minimum blow out size and @xmath9 = 20 @xmath1 m ) located at a distance of 86.3 au from the central star , as observed in previously published scattered - light images . </S>",
    "<S> since the photo - desorption lifetime for the icy particles is @xmath21400 yr , significantly less than the estimated @xmath212 myr age of the system , we hypothesize that we have detected debris that may be steadily replenished by collisions among icy kuiper belt object - like parent bodies in a newly forming planetary system . </S>"
