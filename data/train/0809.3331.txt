    "theoretical accounts of molecular collisions in magnetic fields are usually based on rigorous close - coupling treatments  @xcite .",
    "analytic models of such collisions are scarce , and limited to the wigner regime , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . here",
    "we present an analytic model of state - to - state rotationally inelastic collisions of closed - shell atoms with open - shell molecules in magnetic fields .",
    "the model , applicable to collisions at thermal and hyperthermal collision energies , is based on the fraunhofer scattering of matter waves  @xcite@xcite and its recent extension to include collisions in electrostatic  @xcite and radiative  @xcite fields .",
    "the magnetic field affects the collision dynamics by aligning the molecular axis with respect to the relative velocity vector , thereby changing the effective shape of the diffraction target .",
    "we consider open - shell molecules in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 electronic states , whose body - fixed magnetic dipole moments are on the order of a bohr magneton  @xcite@xcite .",
    "these states coincide with the most frequently occurring ground states of linear radicals , which are exemplified in our study by the cah(@xmath3 ) , o@xmath11 ) , and oh(@xmath6 ) species .",
    "we take , as the closed - shell collision partner , a he atom .",
    "helium is a favorite buffer gas , used to thermalize molecules and radicals produced by laser ablation and other entrainment techniques @xcite .",

    "this is tantamount to the energy sudden approximation , which is valid when the collision time is much smaller than the rotational period , as dictated by the inequality @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the massey parameter , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite . here",
    "@xmath22 is the rotational level spacing , @xmath23 the rotational constant , @xmath24 the collision energy , @xmath25 the wavenumber , @xmath26 the reduced mass of the collision system , and @xmath27 the radius of the scatterer .",
    "the second approximation replaces the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ inelamplsudden ] ) by the amplitude for fraunhofer diffraction by a sharp - edged , impenetrable obstacle as observed at a point of radiusvector @xmath28 from the scatterer , see fig .",

    "[ fig : fraunhofer ] .",
