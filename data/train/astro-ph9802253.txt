    "the detection of galaxies at large redshifts that are forming stars for the first time , the so  called primeval galaxies , remains a very important astrophysical challenge .",
    "bearing in mind that galaxy formation may not be assigned to any preferential cosmological epoch but instead is probably a continuous process , one might find left  over pristine gas pockets that are forming young galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "for this reason there may be star  forming galaxies in our local universe that look very much like distant primeval ones .",
    "hopes have been that ly@xmath0  emission could be a signature of star formation that would be recognized up to very large redshifts ; hence there have been numerous studies of the ly@xmath0  emission from distant and local starbursts .",
    "early iue observations were performed on more than a dozen nearby starburst galaxies in its swp low resolution mode ( meier & terlevich 1981 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1984 ; deharveng et al .",
    "1986 ; hartmann et al .",
    "1988 and terlevich et al .",
    "galaxies with redshifts large enough that their ly@xmath0emission is separated from the geocoronal line were selected .",
    "it was realized from the very beginning that the ly@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratio and the ly@xmath0equivalent width are much smaller , by at least an order of magnitude , than expected from the recombination theory .",
    "these early works have also shown a possible anticorrelation between the ly@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratio and the hii galaxy metallicity ( actually the o / h abundance , as measured in the ionized gas ) .",
    "these results , the lack of `` primeval galaxies '' at large redshift in blank sky searches for redshifted ly@xmath0  emission and the few tentative detections of ly@xmath0  emission from the damped ly@xmath0  systems have been attributed to the effects of dust absorption that preferentially destroys ly@xmath0  photons ( charlot & fall 1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "the process behind this is that the transfer of ly@xmath0  radiation is strongly affected by resonant scattering from neutral interstellar hydrogen atoms . by increasing enormously their optical path length , ly@xmath0",
    "photons become more vulnerable to dust absorption , even in small amounts ( neufeld 1991 ; charlot & fall 1991 ; chen & neufeld 1994 ) .",
    "this process was believed ( even in the early paper of meier & terlevich 1981 ) to be able to account for the anticorrelation between the ly@xmath0  emission line visibility and the dust abundance in these galaxies , as parameterized by the metallicity .",
    "alternatively such an anticorrelation has been attributed to a metallicity  dependent extinction law at the wavelength of ly@xmath0  ( calzetti & kinney 1992 , valls - gabaud 1993 ) .",
    "however this conclusion seems very unlikely in view of the anticorrelation between the ly@xmath0  equivalent width and the gas - phase abundance of oxygen o / h .",
    "charlot & fall ( 1993 ) have emphasized the advantages of using the ly@xmath0  equivalent widths rather than the ly@xmath0/h@xmath2 ratios , because the former are independent on the extinction curve of the dust and can be measured with a single observational device .",
    "their discussion of the anticorrelation between the ly@xmath0  line equivalent widths and the o / h abundances in a sample of nearby star - forming galaxies has examined several factors that will affect the observed ly@xmath0emission from galaxies , among which contributions from supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei , the orientation of the galaxy and the absorption by dust .",
    "they finally suggest that the structure of the interstellar medium ( porosity and multi - phase structure of the medium ) is most probably the dominant one .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the other hand , the ly@xmath0  emission in haro  2 is accompanied by a broad absorption in the blue wing of that line , with the general appearance of a typical p  cygni profile . the amount of neutral gas that produces the blue absorption trough at ly@xmath0  is rather modest and of the order of n  ( hi ) = 7.7@xmath3 atom @xmath4 .",
    "the crucial point here is that the neutral gas responsible for the absorption in this galaxy is not at the velocity at which the ly@xmath0  photons were emitted .",
    "moreover , it seems that all the neutral gas along the line of sight is being pushed by an expanding envelope around the hii region , outflowing at velocities close to 200 kms@xmath1 .",
    "this interpretation is of course strengthened by the presence of other detected absorptions of oi , siii and sisc iii due to outflowing gas in front of the ionizing hot stars of the central hii region .",
    "the heliocentric velocities of all these absorptions are lower by about 200 km s@xmath1 than that of the bulk of the galaxy as measured in the 21-cm line and of the optical emission lines . to confirm this hypothesis , legrand et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have obtained high resolution spectroscopic observations of h@xmath0 with the william herschel telescope at la palma , finding evidences of an expanding shell not participating in the rotation of the galaxy .",
    "comparison of the ly@xmath0  with the h@xmath0 profiles shows that the ly@xmath0  line is significantly broader than h@xmath0 , suggesting also scattering of photons from the back side of the expanding neutral cloud .",
    "the data on the other three hii galaxies with detected ly@xmath0  emission confirm that haro 2 is not an isolated case .",
    "all spectra show ly@xmath0  emission with a broad absorption on their blue side except for eso 350-ig038 in which the emission is seen atop of a broad structure requiring several filaments . when the metallic lines are detected , they are always blueshifted with respect to the ionized gas , further supporting the interpretation . in the case of eso 350-ig038",
    "the velocity structure seems to be more complicated and several components at different velocities are identified on the metallic lines .    the ly@xmath0  absorption profile fitting requires one or several components ( in addition with a galactic component if the redshift is small ) .",
    "we find relatively little scatter in the derived column densities ( see table  [ tab : lyman ] ) .",
    "most clouds have a column density log  n(hi ) of nearly 19.7 to 21.1 .",
    "the static clouds tend to have larger column densities than the moving ones that are also splitted into several components as expected in a dynamical medium .",
    "the main conclusions that are drawn from this set of data is that complex velocity structures are determining the ly@xmath0  emission line detectability , showing the strong energetic impact of the star - forming regions onto their surrounding ism .",
    "this velocity structure is indeed the driving factor for the ly@xmath0  line visibility in the objects of our sample .",
    "we want to stress again that if the absorbing gas is not static with respect to the ionized region , the ly@xmath0  emission line would be detected , almost independently on the dust and metal abundance of the gas .",
    "it would be affected of course by the same extinction than the uv continuum but this extinction would not be enhanced by resonant scattering effects .",
    "if the neutral gas is static with respect to the hii region , the covering factor by these neutral clouds would probably become the key factor determining the visibility of the line .",
    "thuan & izotov ( 1997 ) have indeed detected strong ly@xmath0  emission in t1214 - 277 , with no evidences of blueshifted ly@xmath0  absorption . in this case",
    "the detection of the line requires that a significant fraction of the area covered by the slit along the line of sight is essentially free from neutral gas , suggesting a patchy or filamentary structure of the neutral clouds . such a geometry would be possible only in galaxies not surrounded by enormous hi clouds , as it seems to be the case in izw  18 and similar objects .    the effect of neutral gas flows helps to understand why luminous high - redshift objects have only been found up to now with linewidths larger than 1000 km s@xmath1 .",
    "redshift galaxies with very strong ( ews @xmath5 500   ) extended ly@xmath0  emission are characterized by strong velocity shears and turbulence ( v @xmath5 1000 km s@xmath1 ) ; this suggests an agn activity , in the sense that other ism energising mechanism than photoionization by young stars may be operating",
    ". however steidel et al . (",
    "1996 ) have recently discovered a substantial population of star  forming galaxies at 3.0@xmath6z@xmath63.5 that were selected not from their emission ",
    "line properties but from the presence of a very blue far - uv continuum and a break below 912    in the rest frame . similarly to our local starbursts they find that 50% of their objects show no ly@xmath0  emission whereas the rest does , but with weak ews no larger than 20    at rest .",
    "the ly@xmath0  profiles of this population look indeed very similar to those of our local starburst galaxies ( franx et al .",
    "1997 ; pettini et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we can conclude from the preceeding discussion that the use of ly@xmath0  as a star formation indicator underestimates the comoving star formation density at high redshift ( e.g. cowie & hu , 1998 ) .",
    "we have analyzed hst uv spectroscopical data of eight hii galaxies aiming to characterize the detectability of the ly@xmath0  emission line in this kind of objects .",
    "we obtain the following results :    * ly@xmath0  emission has been observed in four out of the eight hii galaxies . in all these four galaxies we have found a clear evidence of a wide velocity field by the presence of deep absorption troughs at the blue side of the ly@xmath0   profiles .",
    "moreover , absorption lines of metallic elements ( oi , siii ) are also significantly blueshifted with respect to the hii gas velocity . *",
    "the determining factor for the detectability of the ly@xmath0  emission line in these galaxies is therefore the velocity structure of the neutral gas along the line of sight , rather than the abundance of dust particles alone .",
    "if most of the neutral gas is outflowing from the ionized region , the ly@xmath0  emission line would escape ( partially ) unaffected , independently on the metal abundance and dust content of this neutral gas .",
    "+ this outflowing material apparently powered by massive stars winds and/or sn may eventually leave the galaxy .",
    "we thus may be witnessing galactic winds resulting from intense star formation activity . in the case of haro  2 ,",
    "lequeux et al . (",
    "1995 ) suggested that 10@xmath7 m@xmath8 are expanding at 200 kms@xmath1 . *",
    "broad ly@xmath0   absorption is detected in all hii galaxies .",
    "the derived n(hi ) column densities lie unexpectedly inside a relatively small range with 6 of the 8 hii galaxies having logarithmic column densities logn(hi ) between 19.9 and 21.1  @xmath4(extreme values are 19.7 and 21.5 ) .",
    "we stress again that the ly@xmath0  photons emitted by the hii region are absorbed or redistributed by the hi gas only if its velocity is the same as that of the hii region .",
    "otherwise , the photons that are resonantly trapped were emitted in the stellar continuum close to ly@xmath0 . *",
    "the dependence of ly@xmath0  emission detectability on the presence / absence of neutral static / outflowing gas along the line of sight ( and within the field of view covered by the slit ) , helps to explain the apparently contradictory detection of ly@xmath0  emission in metal and dust  rich galaxies ( like haro  2 ) , while it may be absent in metal and dust deficient objects , of which izw  18 is the prototype . * a partial covering factor of the hii region by neutral gas , with low hi column densities , would be required to allow the detection of the ly@xmath0  emission line if the neutral gas is static with respect to the ionized regions . * the generally weak or absent ly@xmath0  emission from `` primeval '' and other galaxies at high redshifts",
    "can only be explained by velocity - structure effects combined with absorption of the ly@xmath0  photons by dust grains .",
    "the relatively small angular extent of these sources implies that if photons were leaking through the neutral gas clouds surface after multiple scattering without being destroyed , the equivalent widths of the lines measured from earth should be significantly higher than observed . *",
    "the present study invalidates attempts to measure the comoving star ",
    "formation rate density at high redshift on the basis of ly@xmath0   emission surveys .",
    "future work should address the several effects discussed in this work to understand the reasons that govern the presence / absence of the ly@xmath0  line emission and absorption : the strength and age of the burst , the metallicity of the gas ( controlling the cooling , hence the wind evolution ) , the gravitational potential of the parent galaxy and its morphology and the hi and the dust distributions will all play a role . the challenge is to determine their relative importance in affecting the ly@xmath0emission and absorption processes .",
    "clearly the way forward is to realistically model the hydrodynamical evolution of the ism in gas rich dwarf galaxies under the influence of starburst of different fractional masses .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the time evolution of neutral gas kinematical and structural parameters .",
