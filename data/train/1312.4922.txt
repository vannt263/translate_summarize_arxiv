    "supermassive black holes are ubiquitous in present - day galaxies @xcite .",
    "numerous observations find tight correlations between properties of the host galaxy and its central black hole @xcite , indicating that the two strongly affect each other s structure and evolution .",
    "understanding this link requires studies of the evolution of supermassive black holes and their immediate environments .",
    "accretion onto the black hole produces observable nuclear activity that may occur in all massive galaxies with a duty cycle of @xcite , and the agn bolometric luminosity @xmath2 is directly related to the accretion rate . since low - luminosity agns are not simply scaled - down versions of their more familiar cousins @xcite , the classical seyfert galaxies and quasars , studying the variation with @xmath2 of various agn radiative signatures sheds light on the evolution of the black hole environment as its accretion rate is decreasing .",
    "prominent signatures of the pc and sub - pc scales around the black hole include spectral lines from the broad - line region ( blr ) and infrared emission from the dusty torus .",
    "observations show that the two are just the inner and outer regions , respectively , of a single , continuous distribution of clouds whose composition undergoes a change at the dust sublimation radius ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "such a structure arises naturally in the disk - wind scenario , which involves the outflow of clouds embedded in a hydromagnetic disk wind @xcite .",
    "outflows are a common component of agns ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and a number of individual sources provide direct observational evidence for the disk wind structure .",
    "@xcite find that only a disk wind outflow can explain the segregation of broad absorption lines in the bal qso sdss j0300 + 0048 . from detailed line profile variability studies",
    ", @xcite finds evidence for an accretion disk wind in the blr of the narrow line seyfert 1 mrk 110 .",
    "analysis of line dispersion of variable broad line emission leads to a similar conclusion also for ngc 5548 @xcite , the well - studied agn whose blr was successfully modeled in great detail with a clumpy disk outflow by @xcite .",
    "disk winds also provide satisfactory explanations for the trends exhibited by high - ionization , broad emission lines from 30,000 sdss quasars @xcite as well as the general properties of uv and x - ray absorption lines in both quasars and seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "all in all , magnetically driven winds seem to be the best candidate for the origin of high - velocity winds emanating from the inner radii of agn accretion disks @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of the disk - wind scenario is the prediction that the torus and the blr disappear at low bolometric luminosities , i.e. , low accretion rates @xcite .",
    "the reason is that , as the mass accretion rate decreases , the mass outflow rate of a disk wind with fixed radial column can not be sustained below a certain accretion limit .",
    "this conclusion , a direct consequence of mass conservation , has been verified in observations .",
    "torus disappearance has been verified in low - luminosity agns by infrared observations @xcite , and the existence of `` true type 2 '' agns  unobscured sources that lack broad - line emission  has been established in studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , among others . in particular , @xcite find that the blr disappears when @xmath4 , where @xmath5 . note that these `` true type 2 '' agns differ from the `` obscured type 2 '' class in the historical agn unified model @xcite . while all type 2 agn have similar optical spectra with narrow emission lines , the `` true type 2 '' agns intrinsically lack broad emission lines due to structural changes rather than torus obscuration . in this work",
    "we use `` type 2 '' to refer to these unobscured `` true type 2 '' agns .        in a significant recent development , @xcite studied in detail an sdss - selected sample of type 1 agns and found that at low luminosity , most of them actually appear as intermediate types .",
    "these observations show that as the accretion rate decreases , the intrinsic agn classification ( apart from torus obscuration ) evolves from type 1 to an intermediate type , and finally at low luminosity , potentially to pure type 2 .",
    "stern & laor note that the observational evidence for true type 2 agns for some previously claimed sources is not yet fully established on the basis of current limits on the absence of broad  emission .",
    "we agree with their assessment .",
    "for example , the upper limits to the broad h@xmath6 luminosity for the majority of the type 2 sources in the palomar survey @xcite are not inconsistent with the level of detected x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "but this just implies ambiguity , not invalidation , since it does not mean that broad  must be there ; the data are simply not conclusive in demonstrating the complete absence of broad . nevertheless , stern & laor also noted that there are sources where the absence of broad  emission is established with such stringent upper limits , well below the level expected from their x - rays , that they indeed appear to be true type 2 agns .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the detection of variable nuclear ultraviolet emission in type 2 liners @xcite and x - ray cores with low levels of intrinsic absorption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "here we advance the view that changes in the accretion rate are responsible for the observed relative strengths of broad emission lines in agns .",
    "we analyze all the available data , including the stern & laor sample , in  2 and find evidence for a consistent trend of intrinsic blr evolution with luminosity . in ",
    "3 we show that the disk outflow scenario offers a natural explanation for the observed spectral evolutionary sequence , and conclude in  4 with summary and discussion .",
    "intermediate - type agns are objects that show broad - line emission at a lower level relative to the narrow lines than in ordinary type 1 sources .",
    "the intermediate classification 1.x was originally based on the flux ratio [ oiii]@xmath75007/h@xmath8 , which increases from type 1.2 to 1.8 ; in type 1.9 agns  is the only broad emission line seen , possibly reflecting insufficient observational sensitivity @xcite .",
    "high - resolution optical or ultraviolet images often reveal the presence of a central point source in intermediates , although the detection difficulty varies depending on the object , the amount of host galaxy dilution , and , importantly , the image resolution @xcite .",
    "the vast majority also contain x - ray cores with little evidence for intrinsic absorption .",
    "historical unification posits that in type 1 agns we have a direct view of the blr and in type 2 the blr is obscured @xcite .",
    "a simple interpolation might suggest that in intermediates the blr is either partially obscured or undergoes extinction by optically thin dust , but this contradicts the presence of a visible central point source and the @xcite finding that the majority of intermediates in their sample are inconsistent with either reddening of the blr or viewing along a line of sight that grazes the atmosphere of a central dusty torus .",
    "@xcite find that at low luminosity most type 1 agns appear as intermediate types , and this can not be explained by partial obscuration or extinction .",
    "these findings show instead that as the accretion rate decreases , broad - line emission progressively declines from its high intensity in quasars and seyfert 1s to the lower relative strength of intermediate - type agns , disappearing altogether at sufficiently low luminosities .      to study this suggested evolution , in figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] we plot the data assembled in @xcite ( 2009 ; hereafter eh09 ) in the @xmath9@xmath3 plane and its equivalent in the @xmath2@xmath10 plane , where  is the eddington luminosity .",
    "we exclude from the sample ngc  1068 and ngc  4388 , which were formally classified as s1.8 and s1.9 by @xcite , respectively , due to the presence of weak broad  emission , although this is scattered radiation from their well - known hidden type 1 nucleus @xcite .",
    "we return to this point below ( see  [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "included are the 8,497 high - luminosity sources from @xcite marked as  qso . \" except for the specific designation of intermediate - type sources , the figure is a repeat of the one in eh09 where all broad - line emitters were shown under the single banner of  type 1 . \" to increase the statistical significance for intermediate types we have grouped type 1.2 together with 1.5 , and 1.8 with 1.9 . for types 11.5 the figure additionally includes 48 sources from @xcite .",
    "this sample was selected from the all - sky survey conducted with the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ) in hard x - rays and thus is largely unbiased toward both obscuration and host galaxy properties .",

    "[ fig : histograms ] ]    in spite of some possible mixing of type 1.x and type 2 agns , the figure reveals an overall segregation between spectral classes of broad - line emitters .",
    "moreover , these classes appear to be stratified roughly in line with the eh09 boundary of broad - line emission , which is reproduced in the figure . to test the possible role of @xmath1 in agn evolution , figure [ fig : histograms ] shows the histograms of this variable for the different broad - line spectral classes ; histograms using the equivalent eddington ratio are redundant because they would involve the variable @xmath13 .",
    "the qso sample from @xcite , shown in the top panel , is sufficiently large to outline a meaningful distribution , faithfully traced by a gaussian plotted in blue with the sample mean and variance .",
    "the bl sources from @xcite have a similar distribution , drawn in red , although their histogram is slightly asymmetric with a higher mean due to the higher luminosity limit of the parent ( high - redshift ) survey . in contrast , the histogram of type 1 sources from @xcite , drawn in green , has essentially the same mean and , accounting for the smaller sample size , shape as the qso sample .",
    "thus , the low - redshift @xcite compilation has a similar luminosity limit as the gh07 sample . with the uncertainties surrounding their spectral classification ,",
    "the nl sources from @xcite are shown in the middle panel together with the combined sample of type 1.2/1.5 sources from w12 and eh09 .",
    "the two distributions are similar , both in shape and mean @xmath11 , giving support to the conjecture that the nl sources might be actually intermediate - type rather than type 2 agns .    further statistical analysis for each spectral class is not warranted because of",
    "the small sample sizes for all but the gh07 data set ( notice the large disparity between the histogram counts ) .",
    "still , figure [ fig : histograms ] establishes an unmistakable trend : when @xmath1 is decreasing , agn broad - line emission evolves away from type 1 toward higher values of the intermediate sequence , disappearing altogether below the eh09 limit where all agns become `` true type 2 '' .        .",
    "in each panel , the distribution mean @xmath11 is listed and drawn as a vertical dashed line .",
    "[ fig : sl_histograms ] ]      @xcite have recently studied an sdss - selected sample of 3,410 type 1 agns . dashed grey lines in figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] outline the regions of parameter space where these sources fall .",
    "although this sample ( hereafter sl12 ) does not extend to luminosities lower than  and eddington ratios below , @xcite were still able to discern the transition to intermediate spectral classes at decreasing luminosities . from a careful decomposition of the  profile into broad and narrow components , with respective luminosities  and",
    ", they show that the narrow component starts dominating the total  profile when the luminosity decreases , and that at @xmath14  intermediate - type agns dominate the population of broad - line emitters : at @xmath15  the mean  profiles are typical of seyfert 1.0s , at @xmath16  they are typical of seyfert 1.5s , while at @xmath16 - , broad - line objects tend to be seyfert 1.8s .",
    "stern & laor also show that seyfert 1.5s and 1.8s can be defined analytically using the /  ratio , with / @xmath17 0.1 marking the transition from type 1.0 to 1.5 and @xmath17 0.3 the transition to 1.8 .",
    "dr .  j.  stern has kindly provided us the data for the full sl12 sample ( table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "we have classified the sources according to the stern & laor /  criteria and found 1,266 type 1.0 objects , 1,306 type 1.5s , and 838 type 1.8s .",
    "figure [ fig : sl_l - m - edd ] shows the @xmath18 and @xmath19 distributions for this sample , the analog of figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] . because of the high density of points , this sample is shown with contour plots instead of a scatter diagram . although limited to relatively luminous objects , the sl12 sample still shows the same stratification by spectral class as in figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] and the same sequence in terms of the variable @xmath1 .",
    "these trends stand out more prominently in figure [ fig : sl_histograms ] , which shows histograms binned in @xmath20 for the three spectral classes , displaying a behavior similar to that seen in figure [ fig : histograms ] .",
    "the mean for type 1.0 sources is essentially the same as for the gh07 and w12 samples . for the intermediates , the mean values are higher for the sl12 sample because the entire low - luminosity end is missing .",

    "the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test for the 1.0 and 1.5 classes returned a @xmath22-statistic of 0.25 , for a probability @xmath23 of being wrong in concluding that there is a true difference in the two groups .",

    "the mean broad - line  covering fraction \" decreases along the sequence from type 1.0 to 1.5 to 1.8 .",
    "[ fig : sl_cf ] ]    @xcite suggest that the transition to intermediate types at decreasing luminosity reflects an increase in the relative strength of the  narrow component rather than a decrease of the broad component emission .",
    "this suggestion was based on their conclusion that  is proportional to the agn bolometric luminosity , i.e. , the broad component  covering factor \"",
    "@xmath34 is the same for all broad - line sources , independent of luminosity .",
    "the evidence came from figure 10 in @xcite , which displays tight correlations between  and the agn monochromatic luminosity @xmath35 in various spectral bands , from 2 kev all the way to 2.2 .",
    "in particular , the tightest proportionality is shown by the 2 kev x - rays ( top - left panel in figure 10 of @xcite ) , the spectral region least contaminated by contributions from star formation .",
    "we reproduce this correlation in figure [ fig : sl_cf ] , only instead of  we plot the ratio @xmath36 , a proxy for the broad component covering factor , vs. @xmath37 , which is generally regarded the most reliable indicator of agn bolometric luminosity .",
    "importantly , instead of a scatter diagram with all sources marked by the same symbol as done in @xcite we distinguish between the spectral classes using different color contour plots .",
    "the figure shows a clear trend of covering factor variation among the different spectral classes . because of the large scatter ( more than 2 orders of magnitude ) of the sample data , lumping all the sources together in a single scatter diagram masked this trend in the stern & laor analysis .    to tease out this effect more clearly ,",
    "figure [ fig : sl_cf - histograms ] shows histograms of the effective covering factors @xmath36 and @xmath38 for the  broad and narrow components , respectively , for the sl12 sample . the right column of panels show that , as suggested by stern & laor , the narrow component covering factor indeed increases along the 1.0@xmath211.5@xmath211.8 sequence .",
    "this increase likely arises from the increased prominence of the star formation contribution to  emission relative to the agn when the latter s luminosity is decreasing . as such ,",
    "this effect reflects external conditions , not any intrinsic variation in the agn structure .",
    "meanwhile the left column of figure [ fig : sl_cf - histograms ] shows that , together with the increase in the narrow component covering factor , the broad component covering factor is _ decreasing _ along the 1.0@xmath211.5@xmath211.8 sequence . to assess the validity of this effect we again ran statistical tests for the null hypothesis that there are no meaningful differences between the broad  effective covering factors of the three classes . for the 1.01.5 comparison the ks test returned @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and the mw test produced @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "for the 1.51.8 comparison the corresponding results were @xmath43 for @xmath44 , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "both tests decisively show that the differences between the classes are real .",
    "they are also highly significant : the difference in @xmath47 of 0.37 dex implies that the broad component covering factor of type 1.8 agns is , on average , less than half that in type 1.0 .",
    "we have attempted to verify that @xmath48 declines even further at lower luminosities but only met with partial success for lack of sufficient data .",
    "the eh09 sample contains 29 sources of type 1.8/1.9 and only 10 of type 1.2/1.5 .",
    "an additional 26 type 1.2/1.5 sources from the w12 sample have greatly aided the analysis in  [ sec : data ] , especially the histograms shown in figure [ fig : histograms ] .",
    "unfortunately , the w12 sample has not yet been subjected to detailed spectral analysis to decompose the  line to its broad and narrow components , and thus could not be used for studying covering factors .",
    "faced with the inadequate number of 1.2/1.5 objects in the eh09 sample , we decided to lump them together with the 1.8/1.9 sources for an overall set of 39 low - luminosity intermediate - type sources .",
    "all necessary data for these objects are tabulated in @xcite and @xcite , including x - ray luminosity integrated over 210 kev , which we converted to the stern & laor 2-kev @xmath49 assuming an x - ray slope of @xmath50 over this range .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : sl_cf - histograms ] , where the eh09 histograms are plotted in the bottom panels because the sample is dominated by 1.8/1.9 sources .",
    "the ratio @xmath36 decreases further from its value for the higher luminosity 1.8 agns of the sl12 sample , as expected from a quantity reflecting intrinsic agn variation .",
    "the decrease in mean values between 1.8/1.9 sources in the sl12 and eh09 samples is about a factor of 70 in luminosity , a factor of 440 in @xmath1 and a factor of 5 in the effective broad - line covering factor @xmath36 . because of the small number statistics at the low - luminosity end this result can not be taken too literally , but the underlying effect is clearly established ",
    "the ratio @xmath36 decreases continuously and significantly with @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , the variation of the ratio @xmath38 between the two data sets is entirely out of line with the luminosity trend within the sl12 sample .",
    "remarkably , the average value of @xmath51 for the eh09 sample ( @xmath52 ) is indistinguishable from that for the sl12 type 1.0 objects , whose narrow h@xmath6 emission is presumably least complicated by host galaxy contamination .",
    "this reflects the fact that the palomar spectra for the eh09 objects  all nearby systems  properly isolate the emission from the galaxy nuclei ( ho et al .",
    "the @xmath38 values for the eh09 sample should not be significantly contaminated by host galaxy emission .",
    "the systematic change of @xmath53 with agn type seen in the left panel of figure 6 is not due to variations of @xmath54 with luminosity .",
    "while the x - ray bolometric correction does change with decreasing luminosity , the variation is too small to account for the observed trend . over the entire 210 kev luminosity range of   covered by the stern & laor sample , @xmath55 within @xmath56 @xcite , while the mean value of the ratio @xmath57 decreases by more than a factor of 2 between type 1.0 and 1.8 sources . and",
    "for the extreme luminosities of the eh09 sample , which span @xmath58  , the x - ray bolometric correction changes only by a factor of 3 , to @xmath59 ( ho 2008 ) , yet the mean value of @xmath60 is down by a factor of 12 from that of the 1.0 sources .    , only for uv instead of x - ray luminosity .",
    "[ fig : sl_bha - uv ] ]    as an additional check of the veracity of this result we have repeated the analysis substituting uv ( 1528  monochromatic luminosity ) for the x - rays .",
    "not all of the sl12 sources have uv data , reducing slightly the sample sizes for 1.0 , 1.5 and 1.8 classes to 1119 , 1165 and 736 , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : sl_bha - uv ] , presenting the same data as figure 7 of @xcite but in a separate histogram for each class instead of a single scatter diagram for all sources .",
    "the similarity with the trend seen in figure [ fig : sl_cf - histograms ] is evident and the statistical tests confirm what is discernible to the eye . comparing the 1.0 and 1.5 classes , the ks test returns @xmath61 for a probability @xmath62 of being wrong in concluding that the two are different .",
    "on the other hand , the mw test produces @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; this test can not exclude the possibility that the difference between the two sets is due to random sampling variability .",
    "the mann whitney test is inconclusive because it is mostly sensitive to differences between the sample medians , which are the same ( @xmath65 ) for both .",
    "in contrast , the kolmogorov smirnov test is decisive because it compares the distribution shapes , and these are significantly different from each other .",
    "there are no such ambiguities in the comparison of the 1.5 and 1.8 samples , which yields @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath45 for an overwhelming @xmath68 ( the returned @xmath28-value is 22@xmath12 away from the mean ) ; these are very clearly different types of objects .",
    "thus the uv data reaffirm the trend established through the x - rays .",
    "denote by @xmath69 the monochromatic luminosity in either x - ray or uv band .",
    "then @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the bolometric correction for the corresponding band . going from high to low luminosities , the bolometric corrections display the opposite behavior in the two bands",
    " @xmath72 is decreasing for x - rays and increasing for uv . yet",
    "both bands display the same trend of variation of @xmath73 with decreasing luminosity over the sl12 sample , showing conclusively that /  is decreasing through the spectral class sequence 1.0@xmath211.5@xmath211.8 . a potential slight increase in @xmath74 throughout the sl12 sample could partly offset the intrinsic decrease of / , bringing the mean values for the 1.0 and 1.5 classes into equality and making the mw test inconclusive , although the ks test remains decisive .",
    "such an increase would still be insufficient to bridge the larger gap to the 1.8 sources , where both tests remain overwhelmingly decisive .",
    "there is no tabulation of uv data for the eh09 sources , so we maintain @xmath36 as our primary indicator for the conversion efficiency of continuum radiation to broad line emission .",
    "figure [ fig : cfplot ] summarizes the results .",
    "the data establish , with high significance , that the average effective covering factor @xmath36 decreases with @xmath20 along the 1.0@xmath211.5@xmath211.8 sequence , albeit with scatter causing some overlap among the agn types .",
    "as is evident from figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] , the sl12 data set samples only the highest luminosity end of intermediate - type agns and thus captures only the high - end boundaries of the 1.5 and 1.8 luminosity distributions . but thanks to its sizeable number of sources , the differences it shows between those boundaries are highly significant as verified by independent statistical tests . among the sl12 sources ,",
    "the covering factor decreases by more than a factor of 2 from type 1.0 to 1.8 .",
    "the eh09 sample shows that the decrease continues further at lower luminosities , its mean value of @xmath36 is a factor of 12 lower than for the type 1.0 sources . even accounting for a decrease in the x - ray bolometric correction and for the fact that the small size of the eh09 sample implies that its mean value is less well - constrained , it seems safe to conclude that , on average , @xmath36 is at least a factor of 3 smaller for type 1.8/1.9 agns than for type 1.0 .",
    "since the immediate vicinity of the central black hole is the only likely source of high - ionization lines with widths in excess of 1,000 km s@xmath75 , the decline of the broad  covering factor reflects a _ significant intrinsic change in the blr at decreasing luminosities . _     for each group",
    "[ fig : cfplot ] ]      as shown in the previous section , low - luminosity , low - eddington ratio systems with broad emission lines are typically of the type 1.8 or 1.9 variety .",
    "another notable property of intermediate types involves double - peaked broad - line profiles , attributed to emission from rotating disks .",
    "such profiles are found in only about 3% of the general broad - line agn population @xcite and most double - peak emitters have accretion rates considerably lower than the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "conversely , low - luminosity , low - eddington ratio systems have a fairly high detection rate of double - peaked profiles @xcite .",
    "significantly , many of the 1.8 and 1.9 agns show double - peaked broad - line profiles while most types 1.2/1.5 do not .",
    "the detection of double - peaked broad h@xmath6 in low - luminosity agns is greatly facilitated by small - aperture spectroscopy afforded by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , a uniform _ hst _  spectroscopic census of the eh09 sample is not available , and thus we do not have robust statistics on the incidence of double - peaked broad h@xmath6 emission in these objects .",
    "general considerations of agn broad line modeling suggest that the emission originates from a collection of clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "significant contributions from the intercloud medium are precluded by its lower density , which implies a higher ionization parameter .",
    "direct observational evidence for the clumpy nature of the blr comes from studies of x - ray variability @xcite and from a detailed study of a set of absorption lines in a quasar outflow @xcite .",
    "as shown above , two phenomena stand out along the 1.0 @xmath21 1.2/1.5 @xmath21 1.8/1.9 sequence : the fraction of bolometric luminosity converted to  broad - line emission decreases , and double - peaked profiles , signatures of rotating disk emission , appear .",
    "the simultaneous emergence of two such disparate effects can be understood if as the luminosity is decreasing , the blr cloud distribution is gradually losing the components with the highest elevations above the disk .",
    "cloud motions near the disk surface can be expected to reflect more closely keplerian velocities , which is why double peaked profiles would emerge in that case .",
    "additionally , lower elevations also reduce the line emission strength because the blr geometrical covering factor , the fraction of the agn sky covered by clouds , becomes smaller , intercepting a smaller fraction of the ionizing continuum . on top of that ,",
    "the ultraviolet / optical continuum emission from the agn accretion disk decreases towards its equatorial plane @xcite , an effect that was demonstrated convincingly by @xcite in a recent study of [ oiii ] equivalent widths .",
    "the combined effect of a smaller geometrical covering and a decrease in the ionizing continuum intensity enhances the impact that a reduction in the height of the cloud distribution has on broad - line emission .",

    "@xcite pointed out that if such winds were seeded with un - magnetized clouds , a configuration known as `` melon seed '' plasma , they could offer a solution to the long standing problem of blr cloud confinement . in that case",

    ", @xcite extended the blandford & payne solution to clumpy disk outflows .",
    "accounting for the change in composition across the dust sublimation radius where @xmath76 @xcite , the blr and torus were unified in a single outflow : at radii beyond  the clouds are dusty and comprise the agn obscuring torus , while the wind regions between  and some @xmath77 contain the broad - line emitting clouds . emmering",
    "et al showed that modeling the blr as a clumpy disk outflow yields good agreement with observations ( see  [ sec : profiles ] below ) .",
    "@xcite considered similarly a wind that uplifts by its ram pressure and confines by its magnetic pressure dense clouds fragmented from the disk .",
    "since the focus of their work was on water maser emission , kartje et al considered clouds at @xmath78 while noting that they differ from blr clouds only in their composition , which does not affect the dynamics . but whereas emmering et al assumed the clouds to move along the outflow streamlines , kartje et al dropped this assumption and studied the actual motions of diamagnetic blobs carried by the wind . even if there were no field in the clouds originally , it would gradually penetrate and break up the clouds , but this process is expected to be slower than the sound speed within the clouds @xcite . following kartje et al we ignore this effect and consider the motion of `` melon seed '' clouds confined by the wind magnetic pressure while accelerated by its ram pressure against the gravitational pull of the central black hole .",
    "the equation of motion of such a cloud with mass , velocity vector @xmath79 and cross - sectional area  normal to its motion relative to the wind is then where @xmath80 is unit vector in the radial direction , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the wind velocity and mass density , respectively @xcite .",
    "the cloud properties enter only through the column density , where  is the proton mass , that characterizes the cloud whatever its geometrical shape . for spherical uniform clouds ,",

    "the wind density @xmath84 can be found from its mass outflow rate through mass conservation . for the @xcite solution , @xmath85 .",
    "since the blr relative thickness is likely @xmath86 @xcite , the logarithmic factor is probably @xmath87 and is omitted for simplicity .",
    "the only property of the clouds that enters is their column density .",
    "this suggests that we convert also  to an equivalent column density .",
    "the ratio @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the local keplerian velocity , has dimensions of surface density ; thus we introduce where the factor @xmath90 is added for convenience .",
    "the cloud equation of motion ( eq .  [ eq : eom1 ] ) can then be written as clouds carried along the wind streamlines have @xmath91 .",
    "projecting on the wind direction , the equation of motion for such clouds becomes where @xmath92 is the angle between the wind velocity and the radial direction . for a cloud to be accelerated along a streamline by the wind ram pressure",

    "( eq .  [ eq : ncrit1 ] ) , tend to follow the wind streamlines while supercritical clouds , @xmath93 , tend to move across streamlines and remain close to the disk surface , as first noted by kartje et al ( 1999 ; see their fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ]    consider first the cloud initial motion near the disk surface , then @xmath92 is the wind launch angle measured from the disk surface ( typically @xmath94 in the blandford & payne solution ) .",
    "the magnitude of the wind launch velocity is comparable to the local turbulence velocity in the disk , which is roughly 10% of the local keplerian velocity @xcite ; that is , @xmath95 close to the disk ( in the blandford & payne solution , the launch velocity of the cold wind is taken as 0 ) .",
    "therefore , the term in square brackets in equation [ eq : eom3 ] can be positive only when @xmath96 ; clouds must be subcritical to accelerate along the wind streamlines . to ensure that such clouds can follow the rising trajectory shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ]",
    "we must verify that their acceleration remains positive away from the disk .",
    "indeed , both relevant ratios increase as the cloud rises .",
    "the ratio /  increases because of the wind acceleration .",
    "confinement by the wind magnetic pressure implies that the gas density inside clouds obeys @xmath97 . with a constant cloud mass and the outflow magnetic field @xmath98 from blandford & payne ,",
    "the radial variation of the cloud properties is @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ". therefore the ratio /  increases with distance as @xmath101  clouds that start subcritical will remain so .",
    "it is also important to note that , in spite of the magnetic pressure confinement , the cloud column density decreases as it rises above the disk .",
    "the vertical range of broad - line emission is thus limited , resulting in a toroidal geometry for the blr .",
    "supercritical clouds , those with @xmath93 , can not float with the wind .",
    "instead , they tend to  sink \" and move across the wind streamlines .",
    "these clouds remain close to the disk surface , similar to the low - lying cloud trajectory in figure [ fig : cartoon ] , with their motions closely mirroring the disk keplerian velocity field @xcite .",
    "the two families of cloud trajectories arise from the difference in dynamics for different cloud column densities .",
    "the ratio of ram pressure and gravitational forces on a cloud is @xmath102 .",
    "ram pressure is the stronger force when @xmath103 while gravity dominates when @xmath104 .",
    "the analysis here mirrors the one in section 5.1 of @xcite with minor differences .",
    "assuming roughly spherical clouds , kartje et al introduced a nominal mass @xmath105 associated with radius  ( their eq .",
    "24 ) , which is related to  via @xmath106 .",
    "then for a cloud with mass  and that radius , @xmath107 .",
    "but the column of such a cloud is @xmath108 ; thus , the results are the same since @xmath109 .",
    "the advantage of the current formulation is in demonstrating explicitly the complete separation between the properties of the wind ( ) and the cloud ( ) , and that the only relevant property of the cloud is its column density ; neither mass nor size matters separately .",
    "if @xmath110 is the accretion rate into the blr then a fraction @xmath111 is carried away by the wind while the fraction @xmath112 reaches the black hole , where it is converted to luminosity with the radiative efficiency @xmath113 .",
    "that is , @xmath114 and @xmath115 so that @xmath116 .",
    "the fraction @xmath111 , obtained from considerations of angular momentum conservation for disk outflows , is  0.10.25 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the single value @xmath111 = 0.25 so that @xmath117 and get from eqs .",
    "[ eq : ncrit1 ] and [ eq : rd ] where @xmath118 . from this value on the blr outer radius , increases inwards as @xmath119 to a maximum of on the blr inner boundary .",
    "the behavior of  is dominated by the variation of @xmath120 , a quantity that spans more than 10 orders of magnitude across the combined set of agns studied in  [ sec : intermediates ] .",
    "the specific luminosity of a broad line can be written as @xmath121 , where  is the overall line luminosity and @xmath122 is the line profile as a function of velocity ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we discuss separately each component .",
    "two factors control @xmath124 , the fraction of the agn luminosity converted into emission in a particular line .",
    "the first is the fraction of continuum radiation intercepted by all clouds .",
    "it depends on the geometry of the blr cloud distribution and on the cloud optical depths , and can be considered the blr geometrical covering factor .",
    "the second is the efficiency with which an individual cloud reprocesses the absorbed continuum into emission in the particular line . given a cloud density , column density and chemical composition , this reprocessing is determined by the continuum spectral shape and the magnitude of its local flux , @xmath125 ( eq .  [ eq : rd ] ) .",
    "all clouds with similar internal properties located at the same scaled radial distance @xmath126 , i.e. , same fraction of the blr radial size , will produce the same line spectrum , whatever the luminosity .",
    "therefore the line conversion fraction @xmath127 does not contain any explicit dependence on luminosity ; it depends only on the continuum spectral shape , the geometry of the cloud distribution and the internal properties of individual clouds .",
    "the line profile @xmath122 is determined by the kinematics and geometry of the cloud distribution .",
    "detailed model calculations of broad - line profiles were reported for two different approaches . @xcite analyzed line emission from an ensemble of clouds moving along the streamlines of a hydromagnetic disk wind in an attempt to reproduce typical properties of observed agn broad lines .",
    "one of the major challenges is the line shapes which show velocity widths in excess of 10,000  together with central cusps with widths of only 300 . since",
    "such sharp cusps are seen in high - ionization permitted metal lines , e.g. , civ @xmath71549 , they can not be solely attributed to the contribution of a narrow component . with suitable choice of parameters , emmering",
    "et al were able to reproduce the observed profile asymmetries and sharply cusped peaks when the emission was dominated by clouds at high altitudes ; emission from low - altitude clouds tended to produce double - peaked profiles instead .",
    "@xcite performed similar calculations with some added details and applied them to the well studied seyfert1 galaxy ngc 5548 , successfully reproducing all observations including line profiles and reverberation measurements .",
    "since these models employed clouds moving with the wind , they would be produced by the cloud equation of motion ( eq.[eq : eom1 ] ) when the gravitational force is omitted .",
    "we denote the profiles produced from such motions .",
    "the other approach , motivated by the double - peaked profiles observed in some agns , invoked emission from the keplerian accretion disk @xcite .",
    "these models successfully explain many details of double - peaked agn observations and also show that the line profiles can turn into single - peaked shapes by the presence of a disk wind with suitable properties .",
    "purely keplerian trajectories would be produced by the cloud equation of motion ( eq .  [ eq : eom1 ] ) when the ram pressure force is omitted .",
    "we denote the line profiles produced by such keplerian motions .      as shown in ",
    "[ sec : trajectories ] , clouds with subcritical columns , @xmath128 , move along the streamlines of disk winds , therefore the profile of line emission from an ensemble of such clouds is .",
    "if the line conversion factor ( the fraction of ionizing radiation which is reprocessed and emitted by the blr ;  [ sec : cbl ] ) of the cloud distribution is , the specific line luminosity is @xmath129 .",
    "similarly , the motions of supercritical clouds , @xmath93 , trace the disk keplerian rotation , therefore we can use  to describe the line profiles they generate . with a line conversion factor ,",
    "the specific line luminosity for an ensemble of supercritical clouds is @xmath130 .",
    "as noted above , the fraction of the continuum converted to broad lines is smaller for low - lying trajectories than for the high - altitude wind trajectories , therefore  is significantly smaller than .    in the most general case",
    ", the blr will contain a mix of both subcritical and supercritical clouds .",
    "denote by @xmath131 the fractional contribution of subcritical clouds to the overall line emission , then the mixture introduces a new fundamental element to broad - line emission . as discussed above , with a fixed continuum spectral shape , cloud distribution and individual cloud properties ,",
    "both the profile @xmath132 and the line conversion fraction  are independent of luminosity . but lowering the luminosity while keeping all other parameters fixed will lower the fraction @xmath131 because decreases with @xmath2 ( eq .  [ eq : ncrit2 ] )",
    ". therefore every cloud with a given column  becomes supercritical once @xmath2 has fallen below the value that yields @xmath133 . with clouds shifting from the sub- to super - critical category",
    ", the cloud distribution is changing even if all the underlying blr properties such as individual cloud parameters , wind streamlines , etc .",
    ", do not change . as a result , the observed line luminosity and profile ( a combination of the elevated - wind and low - disk components ) are changing with @xmath2 . over  yields @xmath134 , and",
    "the overall profile is @xmath135      column densities of blr clouds can be expected to cover a large range , but only those exceeding a minimal  5  will contribute to the observed broad - line spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an upper bound on can be deduced from time variability of x - ray observations , caused by the passage of obscuring clouds across the line of sight .",
    "@xcite find obscuring cloud columns in the range ",
    ", although an exceptional case of a compton thick cloud ( @xmath136 ) has also been recorded @xcite .",
    "whatever the maximal column , it is reasonable to assume that clouds with lower columns are more abundant , namely , the cloud distribution rises toward lower .",
    "when the column density of a cloud at distance @xmath137 from the black hole is in the range the cloud is subcritical .",
    "the lower bound , , is universal , set by atomic physics , while the upper bound , @xmath138 , varies across the blr as @xmath119 ( eq .  [ eq : ncrit1 ] ) , in addition to its overall variation with the agn luminosity and black hole mass ( eq .  [ eq : ncrit2 ] ) .",
    "a declining luminosity pushes the upper bound downward toward the lower one , shrinking the range of subcritical columns . as a result ,",
    "clouds that were subcritical at the higher luminosity can become supercritical , their trajectories shifting away from the wind streamlines into the low - lying , rotating category ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "this reduces the fraction @xmath131 and shifts the blr emission from the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : blr ] to the second , lowering the broad - line strength and leading to the emergence of double - peaked profiles .",
    "shrinkage of the subcritical range with decreasing luminosity provides a natural explanation for the @xmath139 sequence as it continually increases the fraction of supercritical columns in the cloud population .",
    "the sl12 sample shows that in spite of the huge range of @xmath120 , observable changes in broad - line emission arise from relatively small variations in this variable : the separation between the mean values of the 1.0 and 1.5 sources in that sample is less than 40% , with an additional decrease of just under 30% separating the 1.8s from the 1.5s ( figure [ fig : sl_histograms ] ) .",
    "this behavior indicates that the fractional contributions of sub- and supercritical clouds to the broad - line emission are roughly comparable in type 1 agns .",
    "indeed , the mean value of @xmath140 for qso and seyfert 1 galaxies is 0.18 ( see figure [ fig : histograms ] ) , and @xmath113 is typically in these sources @xcite . with @xmath141 , the value of varies from 2  on the blr inner boundary to a minimum of 2  on its outer edge .",
    "since the distribution of cloud column densities can be expected to rise toward its lower end , subcritical columns can dominate the emission and lead to standard type 1 spectra , with supercritical columns still comprising a significant fraction .",
    "this explains why relatively small changes in @xmath120 from its particular value in type 1 agns suffice to tip the balance between the two families of trajectories , triggering the change in spectral type .    at the lower luminosities of the eh09 sample , supercritical columns dominate decisively .",
    "in type 1.8/1.9 sources , the histograms in figure [ fig : histograms ] show that the mean value of @xmath1 is three orders of magnitudes lower than for type 1.0 .",
    "if @xmath113 were the same for both classes ,  for type 1.8/1.9 would be only 1  on the blr inner boundary and all clouds would be supercritical everywhere .",
    "however , in all likelihood the accretion in these sources has a low radiative efficiency , with @xmath142 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , so  can be expected to be comparable to  on the inner boundary ( eq .  [ eq : ncrit2 ] ) .",
    "this would still make the cloud population of type 1.8/1.9 dominated by supercritical column densities , resulting in weaker broad - line emission together with double - peaked profiles when viewed from suitable angles .",
    "further decrease of the accretion rate triggers the mass conservation limit found in @xcite , broad - line emission disappears and the agn becomes a true type 2 .",
    "intermediate - type agns have been generally dismissed as a minor detail of unification . instead , the data now show that as the accretion rate decreases , broad - line emission progressively declines from its high intensity in quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies to the lower relative strength of intermediate - type agns , disappearing altogether at sufficiently low luminosities .",
    "as summarized in figure [ fig : cfplot ] , a decreasing accretion rate is accompanied by a decrease in the fraction of bolometric luminosity converted into broad - line emission .",
    "this systematic behavior is at odds with the fine - tuning required by explanations of the intermediate types that were based on partial obscuration or transient radiative transfer effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it also can not be explained by a change in the continuum spectral shape .",
    "although the disappearance of the big blue bump causes significant variation of the spectral energy distribution from high- to low - luminosity agns ( see , e.g. , ho 2008 , figure 7 ) , an explanation based on such changes could not apply to the sl12 data set .",
    "thanks to a sizeable number of sources , this sample provides decisive evidence for transitions to intermediate spectral classes at fairly high luminosities  the mean luminosity is 3  for the sample type 1.0 objects , 1  for the 1.5s and 4  for the 1.8s .",
    "there are no significant changes in continuum spectral shape among such luminosities ; indeed , such changes do not show up across the entire sl12 data set , whose luminosity range is  = 32  ( stern & laor 2012a ) .",
    "the spectral sequence @xmath143 is a true evolutionary sequence , reflecting evolution of the blr structure with decreasing accretion rate onto the central black hole .",
    "the emergence of double - peaked profiles along the sequence is additional support for such an inherent structural change .    according to standard unification ,",
    "the torus obscuration and the observer location are the only factors in determining the spectral class of any given agn .",
    "there is no a priori expectation for the broad line spectrum to correlate with @xmath1 . yet",
    "the spectral classes of broad - line emitters cluster around different values of @xmath1 and this variable controls the evolutionary sequence of type 1 @xmath21 1.2/1.5 @xmath21 1.8/1.9 @xmath21 2 . additionally , double - peaked profiles emerge along this sequence .",
    "both trends find a natural explanation in the disk - wind scenario for the blr : as the luminosity decreases , more and more clouds shift from high - altitude trajectories along the wind streamlines to low - altitude motion that follows closely the disk rotation ( figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "this reduces the fraction of the continuum intercepted by the blr  hence the reduction in line strengths  and leads to the emergence of double - peaked emission .",
    "the transition between the two families of trajectories is controlled by a wind - determined critical column  ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : ncrit1 ] and [ eq : ncrit2 ] ) ; this accounts for the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "this transition happens even if neither cloud properties nor wind structure change with luminosity .",
    "it occurs under a broad range of conditions , as it arises simply from the competition between the black hole gravity and the wind ram pressure , irrespective of the detailed mechanisms that drive and control the outflow .",
    "furthermore , this mechanism properly explains the values of @xmath20 at the transitions from one spectral class to the next in spite of the huge variation range of this variable that spans more than 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "the quantity that sets the scale for these transitions is  5 , the minimal column density for clouds to partake in broad line emission .",
    "is determined purely by atomic constants , entirely independent of any considerations that involve the blr detailed structure .",
    "this fundamental quantity sets the proper scale for the transitions between spectral classes without any free parameters or fine tuning , another success of the disk - wind scenario .",
    "it is important to note that exceptions exist : not every double - peaked object has a low eddington ratio and not every intermediate - type agn has a low luminosity .",
    "such cases are to be expected since the blr structure is anything but simple .",
    "still , the trends are quite clear and fit well into the outflow scenario .",
    "while the variable @xmath1 , which is close to the eddington ratio , emerges naturally , it controls only one aspect of the disk outflow ; other dynamical effects may introduce additional dependencies .",
    "for example , @xcite considered the interplay between radiation pressure and gas pressure on the outflow and found a dependence on @xmath144 , practically indistinguishable from @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the growing importance of radiatively inefficient accretion flows at lower eddington ratios could also play a role in the blr evolution , especially in governing the details of the transition between various spectral classes @xcite .",
    "moreover , while the bulk of the data shows diminishing broad - line emission with accretion rate , two recent discoveries buck the trend . @xcite and @xcite have found agns with very low black hole masses ( 56 ) and very high eddington ratios , but no broad lines . in both cases ,",
    "the absence of broad lines is highly significant . because of their high eddington ratios , both objects are above the eh09 boundary ( figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] ) , an absolute limit that follows from mass conservation .",
    "this limit implies that there should be only true type 2 objects below the eh09 boundary , but it does not preclude true type 2 agns above it . still , these objects do not fit the general observed pattern and are not explained by our scenario .",
    "they require another explanation , and some possibilities are discussed in @xcite .",
    "model calculations employing clouds moving along disk - wind streamlines successfully explain details of broad - line profiles , including their difficult - to - explain sharply cusped peaks @xcite .",
    "model calculations of disk emission successfully explain the double - peaked profiles observed in some agns @xcite .",
    "the first class of models corresponds to @xmath145 in eq .",
    "[ eq : blr ] , the second to @xmath146 ; therefore our model accrues all the benefits of both earlier models at the two proper ends of the accretion rate spectrum .",
    "a full calculation of the combined profiles and line strengths with accretion rate is a complex task .",
    "other broad emission lines may also deviate slightly from the behavior observed for since the supercritical clouds may receive insufficient ionizing flux to support the higher - ionization broad lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this arises from the combined effect of a decrease of the ionization parameter at low altitudes because of the continuum anisotropy and the change in the ionizing continuum spectral shape at low luminosities .",
    "we plan on performing such detailed calculations and will report their results in future publications .",
    "observations of intermediate - type agns present unique challenges . based on line",
    "spectra alone , ngc 1068 would be classified as type 1.8 , ngc 4388 as 1.9 .",
    "yet both are seyfert 2 galaxies with obscured nuclei ( compton - thick obscuration in the case of ngc 1068 ) whose weak broad lines reflect scattered light , as determined by polarization measurements @xcite . in an inherent ambiguity , type 1.8/1.9",
    "spectra can arise from either the directly - arriving weak broad - line emission of an unobscured nucleus , intrinsically a type 1.8/1.9 agn , or indirectly through the scattering of strong broad lines from an obscured nucleus .",
    "the latter is an obscured type 2 agn appearing as a spurious 1.8/1.9 object because of a hidden central engine whose intrinsic broad line strength is that of a type 1 source .",
    "spectral information alone is insufficient to resolve the ambiguity of these two very different situations .",
    "a decisive determination of the true nature of a type 1.8/1.9 spectrum requires also a measurement of the obscuration to the nucleus , ideally supplemented by a measurement of the broad - line polarization .    since  varies as @xmath119 ( eq .  [ eq : ncrit1 ] )",
    ", the transition from high - altitude wind trajectories to low - altitude disk - like rotation when is decreasing should occur first at larger radii .",
    "lines emitted further out in the blr should thus be the first to display reduced relative strengths and double - peaked emission profiles at lower luminosities .",
    "this provides a testable prediction of the mechanism proposed here .",
    "much of the support for the data analysis presented here comes from the sl12 sample , which was culled out of the sdss database . for the most part",
    ", these observations lacked the angular resolution to separate the agn from the host galaxy and could not identify agns with luminosities below , where the bulk of the intermediate - type population is expected .",
    "but what the sl12 sample lacked in luminosity coverage it made up in sheer size , showing the power of large samples to reliably identify trends in the data .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : l - m - edd ] , the crucial low - luminosity end where most intermediate - type agns can be expected to reside and most of the blr evolution to occur is covered only sparsely in comparison .",
    "future observations with higher angular resolution are needed to fill this gap and provide more complete coverage of the full evolution of the agn broad line region .",
