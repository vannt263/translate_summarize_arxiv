    "a wide variety of mass transport systems ranging from traffic flow to polymer gels @xcite exhibit nonequilibrium condensation phenomena .",
    "these include basic microscopic dynamics ubiquitous in nature such as aggregation , fragmentation and diffusion .",
    "the nonequilibrium steady states of these systems are classified into two types of phases , so - called fluid phase and condensed phase .",
    "a finite fraction of total particles condenses on a single site in the condensed phase . in the fluid phase",
    ", the particle number on each site fluctuates around the density of total particles ( @xmath10 ) without the condensation .",
    "as the rates of these processes vary , the condensation phase transitions between the two phases may take place at a certain critical density @xmath22 .",
    "one of the simplest mass transport models exhibiting the condensation transitions is a conserved - mass aggregation ( ca ) model @xcite .",
    "ca model evolves via diffusion , chipping and aggregation upon contact which arise in a variety of phenomena such as polymer gels @xcite , the formation of colloidal suspensions @xcite , river networks @xcite and clouds @xcite . in one - dimensional ca model ,",
    "the mass @xmath4 of site @xmath1 moves either to site @xmath23 or to site @xmath24 with unit rate , and then @xmath25 and @xmath26 . with rate @xmath11 , unit mass chips off from site @xmath1 and moves to one of the nearest neighboring sites ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward . as total masses are conserved , the conserved density @xmath10 and the rate @xmath11 determine the phase of ca model .",
    "the @xmath29 case corresponds to the well - known zero range process ( zrp ) with a constant hopping rate @xcite .",
    "the existence of the condensation transitions in ca model depends on the symmetry of movement , the constraints of diffusion rate and the underlying network structure @xcite . in the symmetric ca ( sca )",
    "model @xcite in which diffusion and chipping direction are unbiased , the condensation transitions take place at a certain @xmath22 .",
    "the steady state properties of sca model is exactly described by the mean field theory @xcite .",

    "it was shown that the existence of the transitions is directly related to the diffusive capture process on unweighted sfns @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , most real - world networks exhibit not only a heterogeneous distribution of degree , but also heterogeneous distribution of weights @xcite .",
    "weights assigned on links characterize the interaction strengths between nodes .",
    "there have been various attempts to understand the underlying mechanism and scale - free behaviors of empirically observed weighted networks @xcite .",
    "also there have been attempts to understand the effect of heterogeneous weights on various dynamics such as synchronization , dynamics of random walks , transport and percolation , and condensation of zero - range process @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that dynamical properties are modified and exhibit non - trivial dependence on the strength of weight . in this paper , as the generalization of our study on ca model on complex networks , we investigate the effect of both heterogeneous degree and weight on the condensation phenomena of ca model on weighted networks .",

    "in addition , masses move from a node @xmath1 to @xmath2 with hopping rate proportional to @xmath48 .",
    "we found that a certain critical @xmath8 exists below which the condensation transitions take place .",

    "therefore we conclude that the condensation always occurs for any nonzero density so a system is always in the condensed phase without any transitions for @xmath92 .",
    "the two different behaviors of @xmath30 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 indicate that a crossover @xmath44 ( @xmath8 ) should exist in the range @xmath95 for @xmath74 .",

    "therefore , the crossover @xmath8 also exists for @xmath70 , but its value is negative unlike the @xmath74 case .",
    "together with the results of @xmath74 , we conclude that the crossover @xmath8 exists for any @xmath106 and @xmath8 varies with @xmath13 . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the existence of @xmath8 and next the condensation nature for @xmath96 .",
    "first , the condensation phenomena of ca model on wsfns is similar to that on unweighted sfns . on unweighted sfns ,",
    "the condensation transitions exist for @xmath37 , while the condensation always occurs for @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "hence the crossover @xmath13 is @xmath107 .",
    "intriguingly , it was shown that the existence of transitions is determined by the survival probability of a diffusing prey chased by a diffusing predator , so - called the lamb - lion problem @xcite .",
    "the reason is as what follows .    in the limit @xmath108 ,",
    "let us assume only an infinite aggregate exists . with the rate @xmath11 , the unit mass is chipped off and moves around with the unit rate . if the chipped mass meets again with the infinite aggregate within a finite time interval , then the infinite aggregate is stable against the chipping process . on the other hand ,",
    "if the chipped mass and the infinite aggregate does not meet again within a finite time interval , then the infinite aggregate would disappear by repeated chipping processes .",
    "therefore , the stability of the infinite aggregate is physically related to the capture process in which a diffusing lion ( infinite aggregate ) chases a diffusing lamb ( chipped mass ) . for the unweighted sfns with @xmath38 , it was shown that the survival probability @xmath109 of a lamb decays exponentially with finite life time @xmath110 @xcite . however , for @xmath111 , @xmath109 is finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the behavior of @xmath109 implies that the condensation transition exist for @xmath37 due to the stable fluid phase in the limit @xmath108 , but only the condensation exist for @xmath38 . as a result ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability of a lamb in the lamb - lion capture process determines the existence of the condensation transitions on unweighted sfns .    similarly , on the wsfns , the existence of the condensation transitions is also expected to depend on the survival probability @xmath109 of a lamb . to see this ,",
    "let us consider two limits , @xmath112 and @xmath113 for a given @xmath13 . in the limit @xmath114",
    ", a walker always moves to a node with the larger degree .",
    "once a walker reach the hub node with the maximal degree , the walker is trapped at the hub node forever . as a result , a lion always captures a lamb at the hub node within a finite time interval .",
    "hence , @xmath109 should decay exponentially with a finite life time . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath115 ,",
    "a walker is forced to reach nodes with the minimal degree . due to the inhomogeneous structure ,",
    "the nodes with the minial degree are connected by nodes with larger degree .",
    "hence , a walker can not escape from one of the nodes with the minimum degree in this limit .",
    "it means that a lion can not always capture a lamb at some other node , so that @xmath109 is finite .    from the behavior of @xmath109 in the two opposite limits",
    ", there should be a crossover @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath109 is finite for @xmath116 and decays to zero for @xmath97 . for the condensation phenomena ,",
    "one expects no condensation transitions ( @xmath117 ) for @xmath97 due to finite life time of a lamb .",
    "instead , the condensation always occurs . on the other hand ,",

    "in weighted networks with symmetric weights , @xmath132 is proportional to the strength of node @xmath1 , i.e. the sum of the weights of the nearest neighboring nodes .",

    ", we consider the symmetric weight @xmath0 , @xmath149 for the weight ( [ w ] ) , @xmath132 is not given as a simple form .",

    "the linearity of @xmath19 comes from the fact that all masses can diffuse .",

    "we also numerically confirm that for @xmath116 , ca model on the wsfns undergoes the same type of the condensation transitions as those of sca model in regular lattice .    finally , we investigate the behavior of the average mass @xmath19 of a node with degree @xmath15 . in zrp with constant chopping rate on networks",
    "@xcite , @xmath19 increases as @xmath20 , and jumps to the total mass of the system at @xmath155 .",

    "furthermore the linearity of @xmath19 is valid for any @xmath267 , which comes from the fact that the diffusion is only the relevant physical factor to decide the distribution @xmath19 .",
