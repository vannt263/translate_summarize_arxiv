    "it constitutes the two - dimensional generalization of the result of lawes and march @xcite for one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonic confinement of fermions .",

    "our work was aimed mainly at transforming the description of the system from one given in terms of wave functions to one which takes as the main variable the particle density .",
    "this procedure , typical of density functional theory ( dft ) , is here possible in an explicit way due to the simplicity of the system , but may serve as a guideline to the use of dft in more complex systems .",

    "the latter is finally used to obtain the kinetic energy density functional ( [ func ] ) in terms of the particle density , which is a main task in dft .",
    "what seems to us therefore to remain outstanding in 2d is to solve the differential equation  ( [ eqdiff ] ) , hopefully analytically and without summation over shells .",
    "the motivation for expecting this is the `` folklore '' that the properties of a fermion fluid are determined by its highest occupied level @xcite .",
