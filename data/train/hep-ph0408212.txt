    "this is because the initial @xmath4 and @xmath111 ( @xmath112 or @xmath113 quarks ) are both left - handed and hence angular momentum along the initial momentum direction is zero , while in the final state the produced @xmath114 quark is left - handed and hence only the left - handed @xmath6 is allowed by the angular momentum conservation .",
    "this selection rule is violated slightly when a charm quark is produced in the final state and because of gluon radiation at higher orders of qcd perturbation theory . the @xmath6 polarization in the laboratory frame",

    "however , lower energy @xmath6 s in the laboratory frame tends to have right - handed polarization because they are produced at backward angles in the cm frame .",
    "at the zero scattering angle @xmath101 of the laboratory frame , the change in the @xmath6 momentum direction occurs suddenly , and hence the transition from the left - handed @xmath6 at high energies to the right - handed @xmath6 at low energies is discontinuous .",
