    "the treatment of long - ranged coulomb interactions remains a substantial challenge in nearly all classical molecular simulations .",
    "the basic problem is that interactions from even very distant charges remain important , as indicated by the divergence of the integral of 1/r from any finite truncation distance to infinity .",
    "this causes problems in computer simulations of systems with charges , where contributions from distant periodic images of the simulation cell must be taken into account , typically by ewald sum techniques .",
    "this also hampers the development of simple , intuitive local pictures and analytic theory when charges are present .",
    "here we discuss basic features of a new approach for charged systems , local molecular field ( lmf ) theory .",
    "lmf  theory was originally applied to lennard - jones ( lj ) systems for both simulation and analytical work  @xcite , and the lmf  approach has been used recently to analyze many charged systems , both uniform and nonuniform , with even greater success  @xcite .    lmf theory can be generally characterized as a mapping that relates structural and thermodynamic properties of a nonuniform system with long - ranged and slowly - varying intermolecular interactions in a given external potential energy field , representing , _",
    "e.g. _ , fixed solutes or confining walls , to those of a simpler `` mimic system '' with properly chosen short - ranged intermolecular interactions in an effective or restructured field .",
    "the strong short - ranged interactions in the mimic system are chosen to give an accurate description of the forces between typical nearest - neighbor molecules in the full system , _",
    "e.g. _ , the repulsive molecular cores in a dense lj fluid , local hydrogen bonds in water , or ion pairs in a strongly coupled ionic system . because of the short range of the interactions in the mimic system , fast and efficient simulations scaling linearly with system size are possible .",
    "the restructured field is determined self - consistently and is the sum of the bare external field in the original system and a density - weighted mean - field average of the remaining long - ranged and slowly - varying parts of the intermolecular interactions .",
    "the restructured field corrects major errors that can arise , especially in nonuniform systems , from applying solely a spherical truncation of the intermolecular pair interactions , exemplified by shifted force truncations for nonuniform coulomb systems  @xcite .",
    "more advanced spherical truncations of @xmath1 exist , such as site - site reaction field techniques  @xcite , but the difficulties in nonuniform situations remain the same .",
    "the lmf  approach offers a very general perspective and the averaging can be carried out for any slowly - varying component of the intermolecular interactions .",
    "we show here that lmf theory takes an especially powerful and simple form , with strong analogies to classical electrostatics , when it is applied uniformly to the basic coulomb @xmath1 interaction alone ( and not , _",
    "e.g. _ , to lj interactions as well ) .",
    "we can then take advantage of symmetries between charges of different signs and magnitudes , interacting with the same spherically symmetric @xmath1 potential , and determine the effective field using only the total charge density , and not separate number densities for each charged species or interaction site as would be required for a general mixture .",
    "we find that the contribution to the restructured field in lmf theory from the slowly - varying parts of the coulomb interactions can be exactly determined from a restructured electrostatic potential that satisfied poisson s equation , but with a gaussian - smoothed charge distribution .",
    "a proper choice of the smoothing length @xmath0 in the gaussian plays a key role in the accuracy of lmf theory , since it also determines the size of the local strong - coupling region within which strong forces from nearest - neighbor sites must be accurately captured by the short - ranged interactions in the mimic system .",
    "previous discussions of lmf  theory for coulomb or lj  systems relied on general arguments and did not exploit all the important simplifications that arise by applying lmf theory only to @xmath1 with the same potential splitting regardless of point charge details . here",
    "we seek to justify and document lmf  theory as completely as possible , accounting for coulomb symmetries .",
    "we show how this leads to a simple , broadly applicable equation for a restructured electrostatic potential , and then we extend results from  @xcite to show that smooth lmf  solutions can still arise from a general class of molecularly - corrugated confinement potentials .",
    "the lmf  equation may be derived for mixtures and standard site - site molecular models . however",
    "the basic features of the derivation are identical regardless of whether we consider a mixture , a site - site molecular fluid , or a single - component system .",
    "therefore , we present the derivation for a single - component system in order to highlight the physical approximations in the derivation without the clutter of the multiple indices necessary in the derivations for mixtures or molecules .",
    "furthermore , symmetries available to us when treating charge interactions will allow us to simplify the lmf  equation for mixtures into a single electrostatic potential equation , as we will show later in section  [ sxn : lmfelect ] .",
    "we assume that the intermolecular interactions @xmath2 in the full system of interest are slowly varying at large separations .",
    "the first step in lmf theory is to divide @xmath2 into properly chosen short- and long - ranged parts : @xmath3 such that @xmath4  contains all the the slowly - varying long - ranged interactions in @xmath2 but remains slowly varying at characteristic nearest - neighbor distances where there are strong forces between neighboring molecules . by construction",
    ", the short - ranged component @xmath5  then captures those strong short - ranged forces but vanishes quickly at larger separations .",
    "lmf  theory then defines a mapping from the full system with pair potential @xmath2 and an external single - particle potential energy function @xmath6 to a _ mimic _ system defined by the short - ranged pair interactions",
    "@xmath5  and an effective or restructured external potential energy function @xmath7 : @xmath8    we call the final combination a _ mimic _ system when @xmath5  and @xmath9  are properly chosen because we seek a system that can capture many relevant structural and thermodynamic properties of the full system .",
    "in addition , we seek this mapping to be closed , in the sense that the mapping should not require any information about the full system other than the original @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "it seems plausible that some effective @xmath9  could account for averaged effects of the neglected long - ranged interactions @xmath4  in the mimic system , but we seek a more careful development of this intuition .",
    "the derivation of the lmf  equation starts with an exact statistical mechanical equation involving structure and forces , the yvon - born - green ( ybg ) hierarchy of equations  @xcite . in one form ,",
    "the first equation in the hierarchy reads @xmath10 this equation relates the gradient of the ( singlet ) density profile of the system , @xmath11 , to the force from the external single particle potential , @xmath6 , and the averaged force between particles , weighted by the conditional singlet density , @xmath12 .",
    "this function @xmath12  is defined as the density at position @xmath13 given that a particle is at @xmath14 , and may be expressed mathematically as the ratio of the two - particle density at @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the single - particle density at @xmath14 : @xmath16 thus , the ybg  hierarchy expresses the rapidly - varying singlet density in terms of the more complex and even more rapidly - varying two - particle density .",
    "there are two related difficulties in trying to extract practically useful information about the singlet density from ( [ eqn : ybgeqn ] ) .",
    "first , the density profile is related to more complicated rapidly - varying functions .",
    "second , there is no obvious manner to create a self - contained loop to determine the singlet density profile , again due to its relation to the higher - order density profile .",
    "typical superposition closures of the ybg  hierarchy attempt to resolve both difficulties by approximating @xmath17 , leading to an equation where the gradient over @xmath14 can be pulled out of  ( [ eqn : ybgeqn ] ) and @xmath11 is defined in terms of _",
    "itself_. however , even for a bulk fluid , this is a poor approximation for any moderately dense liquid  @xcite .",
    "the superposition approximation neglects any excluded volume or specific - binding interactions that alter the small @xmath18 nature of @xmath12 relative to @xmath19 .",
    "replacing the conditional singlet density with the singlet density simplifies the equation but also effectively includes with large weight too many configurations where two particles are improbably close to each other , leading to great inaccuracies .",
    "we assume that there exists a good choice of @xmath5  that captures those short - ranged excluded - volume and specific - binding contributions .",
    "we will describe such a choice  @xcite for splitting @xmath1 using the smoothing length @xmath0  in section  [ sxn : lmfelect ] .",

    "equation  ( 7 ) formally holds for any choice of @xmath5  and @xmath4 , and because conditional densities still appear , it generally has most of the problems of the standard hierarchy equations noted after ( [ eqn : conden ] ) .",
    "thus it may seem we have made little progress .",
    "but this is not the case for proper choice of @xmath5  and @xmath4with the properties sketched above .",

    "physically - motivated approximations to the exact  ( 7 ) will result in a final lmf  equation below in ( [ eqn : lmfgeneral ] ) that has a simple mean - field form .",
    "the following discussion elucidates that the lmf equation is not a blind assertion of mean - field behavior but rather a controlled and accurate approximation , provided that we choose our mimic system carefully .",
    "recalling from ( [ eqn : potsplit ] ) that @xmath24 , the lmf derivation focuses on making two connected and physically - reasonable approximations based on choosing a short - ranged @xmath5  that will induce the correct nearest - neighbor structure , where the conditional singlet and singlet densities differ the most , and a corresponding @xmath4   that is slowly - varying on that length scale . as we will see in section  [ sxn : lmfpotslit ] , the form of the coulomb potential grants us the freedom to fulfill both conditions by choosing a single smoothing length @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath5 and @xmath4 are chosen correctly , we shall have a `` mimic system . ''    by making approximations to  ( 7 ) , the equality of densities expressed in ( [ eqn : lmfsingletreq ] ) will only hold approximately , and we will find an equation based on the exact  ( 7 ) that will also no longer be exact . but all will be accurately satisfied with proper choices of @xmath5  and @xmath4 .",
    "the general arguments below have been briefly sketched before  @xcite , but the form of  ( 7 ) allows us to make a more precise statement of the necessary approximations .",
    "we note that ( [ term : lmfmeanforce ] ) depends only on the density response of the mimic system , and no information about the density response of the full system or any conditional density is needed .",
    "thus if terms  ( [ term : mimicfulldiff ] ) and  ( [ term : condsingletdiff ] ) could be neglected , then ( [ term : lmfmeanforce ] ) alone would define a closed equation for the mimic system .",
    "the right side of ( [ term : lmfmeanforce ] ) still transforms as a gradient and should display all the associated properties . in that sense ,",
    "neglecting terms  ( [ term : mimicfulldiff ] ) and  ( [ term : condsingletdiff ] ) together may well be more accurate than taking either one of the following approximations individually .    with proper choice of @xmath5  and @xmath4",
    ", we may reasonably neglect the final two terms in  ( 7 ) using the following arguments :    1 .",
    "[ item : smallrapprox ] term  ( [ term : mimicfulldiff ] ) probes the difference between the conditional singlet densities for the full and mimic systems via convolution with @xmath25 .",
    "the integrand will be quickly forced to zero at larger @xmath18 by the vanishing gradient of the short - ranged @xmath26 .",
    "since both the full and mimic systems have the same strong short - ranged core forces with an appropriately chosen @xmath5 , and these core forces should mainly determine the short - ranged part of the conditional densities , it seems plausible that with proper choice of @xmath5 , term  ( [ term : mimicfulldiff ] ) can be neglected .",
    "this is significantly better than any superposition approximation for the conditional densities and does not require us to numerically estimate either conditional density .",
    "[ item : largerapprox ] term  ( [ term : condsingletdiff ] ) probes the difference between the conditional singlet density and the singlet density of the _ full _ system . as explained previously with relation to standard closures of the ybg equation , assuming their equality can be highly problematic at short distances .",
    "however , we are saved by the fact that this difference is paired with @xmath27 . since",
    "@xmath5  has been chosen to encompass core interactions , @xmath4  will be simultaneously slowly - varying over those nearest - neighbor distances , so the associated force is essentially zero for exactly the range of distances where the conditional singlet density and singlet density differ significantly .",
    "thus we expect for many liquids that the integrand in term  ( [ term : condsingletdiff ] ) may also be accurately approximated as zero .",
    "these two approximations allow us to truncate the ybg  hierarchy .",
    "no explicit knowledge of the conditional singlet density in either the full or the mimic system will be required , but we expect the conditional singlet density of the mimic system to closely resemble that of the full system at short range .",
    "notably , the second approximation will fail when there are long - ranged pair correlations arising from capillary waves at the liquid - vapor interface or the divergence of the correlation length near the critical point . in those instances",
    ", the conditional singlet density will not be approximately the same as the singlet density well beyond nearest - neighbor distances .",
    "however , we do expect this approximation to hold in strongly - coupled charged systems away from the critical point where there exist pair correlations that decay exponentially over those nearest - neighbor distances .    with these two coupled approximations , only ( [ term : lmfmeanforce ] ) remains , and we can take the gradient with respect to @xmath14 outside of the integral . then , integrating over @xmath14 yields the general lmf equation @xmath28 )    u_1\\left(\\left|{\\mathbf{r}}-{\\mathbf{r}}^\\prime \\right|\\right ) + c ,    \\label{eqn : lmfgeneral}\\ ] ] where the integration constant @xmath29 will be set by boundary conditions .",
    "the form of this equation highlights the connection with mean - field techniques .",
    "the function @xmath9  may be viewed as an averaging of the slowly - varying , long - ranged portions of the pair potential over the single - particle density @xmath30 .",
    "the hierarchy has been successfully truncated since @xmath9  is defined in terms of only @xmath30 .",
    "provided sufficient computer time to simulate the short - ranged mimic system and therefore close the self - consistent loop between @xmath7 and @xmath31 , the lmf  equation is exactly soluble .",
    "this equation is not a nave mean - field ansatz for @xmath9  since it arises from reasonable approximations to exact statistical mechanical equations .",
    "the crux of lmf  theory , however , is choosing reasonable @xmath5  and @xmath4  such that the necessary approximations are accurate .",
    "the next section discusses this choice for @xmath1 .",
    "here , we explain our choice of @xmath5  and @xmath4  for charge interactions . then , we seek to highlight the symmetry and simplifications possible when applying the lmf  equation to purely charge - charge interactions by developing the lmf  equation for a single restructured electrostatic potential , rather than for separate potential energy functions for each atom type .      in cgs units ,",
    "the pair interaction between two charges , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , is @xmath34 the factor @xmath35 is simply the dielectric constant of a uniform medium in which the charges are immersed .",
    "the details of charge magnitudes , signs , and choice of cgs or si units will change from system to system , but the underlying functional form @xmath1 will remain constant .",
    "thus , following  @xcite , we introduce @xmath36  and @xmath37  to split this function as @xmath38 into short - ranged and long - ranged components .",
    "both @xmath36  and @xmath37  will yield either a potential energy or an electrostatic potential , with appropriate prefactors .",
    "work of previous researchers  @xcite revealed that a beneficial choice of @xmath37  is the functional form associated with the electrostatic potential due to a unit gaussian charge distribution of width @xmath0 , defined as @xmath39 leading to a @xmath37  given by @xmath40 this @xmath37  is slowly - varying in @xmath41-space over the _ smoothing length _ @xmath0 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , this choice of @xmath37  also simultaneously isolates only the small wave - vector components of the coulomb potential .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath37  is @xmath42 and the gaussian function attenuates any large-@xmath43 components that would be rapidly - varying in @xmath41-space . thus the @xmath37  is particularly well - suited for mean - field averaging .",
    "potential split for two different values of the smoothing length @xmath0 .",

    "this split is shown in  figure  [ fig : potsplit ] along with a demonstration of the impact of increasing the smoothing length @xmath0 on @xmath36  and @xmath37 .",
    "the form of @xmath37  is slowly varying over @xmath0 , and @xmath36  approximately represents a coulomb core potential of range @xmath0 .",
    "tuning @xmath0  to larger values increases the range of @xmath36  and simultaneously smooths the variation of @xmath37  over characteristic nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "since @xmath1 has no inherent length scale , the split between short- and long - ranged by the smoothing length @xmath0  may be tailored to each situation . this length @xmath0  should not be viewed as a fitting parameter , but rather a _ consistency _ parameter .",
    "we expect that choosing @xmath0  too small will result in poor and rapidly - varying results from full lmf theory as @xmath0 is changed since the mean - field average will be over rapidly - varying interactions .",
    "however once @xmath0  reaches a @xmath46  that is related to characteristic nearest - neighbor distances , the assumptions used in the previous section to derive the lmf  equation from the ybg  hierarchy become accurate , and essentially the same results should be found for larger @xmath0 values as well  @xcite .",
    "thus we expect that self - consistently applied lmf theory with an appropriately chosen @xmath0  will yield a true mimic system .",
    "this requirement for reasonable core inclusion has been explored in previous papers  @xcite .    for small @xmath47 , the force due to",
    "@xmath36  is quite similar to that of a bare point charge . by increasing @xmath0",
    ", we increase the effective range of these essentially unscreened coulomb interactions .",
    "thus , @xmath36  can be thought of as a gaussian - truncated ( gt ) or `` short '' coulomb interaction . we refer to a model with generically - truncated coulomb interactions as a short model and with @xmath36  specifically used as a gt model .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that short gt water , where all the point charges in spc / e water are replaced by @xmath36  with no account taken of the effective field , can give a surprisingly accurate description of all site - site correlations for bulk water .",
    "but this same approach can fail spectacularly for electrostatic correlations in nonuniform systems unless corrected by the inclusion of the long - ranged forces via the lmf - restructured potential  @xcite .",
    "the functional form of @xmath36  suggests both ewald sums  @xcite and wolf sums  @xcite .",
    "ewald sums , however , seek to explicitly evaluate the forces from @xmath37  at each timestep using an exact sum over the fluctuating periodic images of the simulation cell , and thus have a very different philosophical approach .",
    "the analogy with wolf sums is much more appropriate in that each results in a spherical truncation @xmath36  applied at each time step .",
    "however , the historical development of the wolf summation technique relies on the observation that charges in ionic lattices are quickly neutralized by slightly shifted `` mirror '' lattices of neutralizing charges . in fluids",
    ", this is altered to assuming that charges within a sharp cutoff radius are exactly neutralized by a shell of charge at the cutoff radius , and the use of @xmath48 to damp the forces from @xmath1 is applied more as a numerical afterthought . in the context of lmf",
    "theory , we view such damping as much more crucial to the success of wolf sums in reproducing the structure of uniform fluids than the imposition of strict neutrality within a sharp cutoff radius .",
    "the gt @xmath36  also bears great similarity to site - site reaction field ( rf ) approaches  @xcite , when the fluid is assumed to be conducting .",
    "the usual rf method generates a truncated @xmath49 from the electrostatic potential of a unit point charge surrounded by a uniform neutralizing spherical charge distribution .",
    "we discuss in the appendix more details of the relation between the gt @xmath36 , and the usual rf @xmath49 as well as a smoother charged - clouds rf truncation @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the choice of spheres as the neutralizing charge distribution in these rf methods leads to a potential that is exactly zero beyond a certain cutoff distance , but this induces a discontinuity in a higher order derivative at the sharp cutoff .",
    "the lmf  choice of gaussians leads to an infinitely smooth and soft truncation both in @xmath41-space and @xmath43-space .",
    "moreover a gt model logically separates the choice of the smoothing length @xmath0 from the possible use for computational convenience of a sharp cutoff at a larger distance along with various local smoothing schemes that could be employed near the cutoff .    despite the general similarities , the theoretical constructs of both reaction field techniques and wolf sums allow for no obvious correction in nonuniform systems , such as the slab confinement to which we applied lmf  theory in  @xcite . as such",
    ", lmf  theory is an important advance in the use of spherical truncations for @xmath1 .",
    "now we will derive a further simplified electrostatic form of the lmf  equation .",
    "we need only consider the lmf  mixture equation here because , with appropriate further approximations , the lmf  equation for standard molecular models collapses onto the mixture lmf   equation as will be shown in a paper dealing more broadly with site - site molecular models  @xcite . using the ybg   equation for mixtures , exactly the same approximations as in section  [ sxn : lmf ] lead to the following lmf  equation for a species @xmath51 in a mixture of different species indexed by @xmath52 and including @xmath51 , as originally given in  @xcite : @xmath53 if the pair interactions being treated were of general form this would be the furthest simplification possible , with an lmf  equation to be solved for each different species .    the observation in  @xcite that a single @xmath0  for all charged interactions proves most useful leads straightforwardly to a much more compact form .",
    "using the lmf   approach only for charges , each @xmath54 may be written as @xmath55 thus ( [ eqn : lmfmixture ] ) may be exactly written as @xmath56 using the natural definition of charge density as @xmath57 we may reexpress the previous equation for @xmath58 as @xmath59 by noting as done in @xcite that @xmath60 may be due to both electrostatic and nonelectrostatic components , we separate @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 encompases nonelectrostatic confinements such as the smooth lj  walls used in  @xcite and @xmath63  represents the general external electrostatic potential .",
    "this observation naturally leads to the following rewriting of each lmf  equation for a species @xmath51 as @xmath64 with a single restructured electrostatic potential @xmath65 , defined as @xmath66 thus all self - consistent requirements on the diverse set of @xmath58 can be written in terms of a single restructured electrostatic potential @xmath65  defined by one lmf  equation involving the equilibrium mobile charge density @xmath67 .",
    "given the convolution definition of @xmath37  as the potential due to a gaussian charge density in ( [ eqn : v1convdef ] ) , we may schematically represent the integral term in ( [ eqn : rescaledv ] ) as @xmath67@xmath68@xmath69@xmath68@xmath1 where @xmath68  indicates a convolution .",
    "thus ( [ eqn : rescaledv ] ) can be exactly rewritten as @xmath70 where @xmath71  represents the smoothing of the charge density by @xmath69  in ( [ eqn : rhog ] ) via the convolution @xmath72    in almost all cases of interest we can picture @xmath63 as arising from a _ fixed _ , external charge distribution @xmath73 , and we should apply the same separation of the coulomb potential to the fixed as well as mobile charges .",
    "this will allow us to express ( [ eqn : smoothedrhomobile ] ) in a suggestive and compact form using the sum of the fixed charge density and the equilibrated mobile charge density profile , @xmath74 .",
    "thus we write @xmath75 just as @xmath37  is the electrostatic potential due to a point charge convolved with a gaussian of width @xmath0 , so @xmath76  is the electrostatic potential due to the convolution of the _ fixed _ external charge density @xmath77 with that same gaussian as defined in ( [ eqn : rhog ] ) and used in ( [ eqn : v1convdef ] ) and ( [ eqn : conv ] ) .",
    "given the definition of @xmath78  and @xmath76 , we write analogously @xmath79 thus defining @xmath80 , the slowly - varying component of the restructured electrostatic potential .    using ( [ eqn : smoothedrhomobile ] ) , this slowly - varying component is exactly given by @xmath81 we see that @xmath82  is the electrostatic potential arising from the gaussian smoothing of the _ total _ charge density , @xmath83 .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : lmfsmoothq ] ) appears as the standard definition of the electrostatic potential due to charge density from first - year textbooks like @xcite .",
    "thus the lmf  equation for the slowly - varying component of the restructured electrostatic potential may be viewed as simply doing classical electrostatics on an _ equilibrium _ , _ smoothed _ total charge density and defining a single external restructured electrostatic potential .",
    "in fact we may in general represent the slowly - varying lmf  equation ( [ eqn : lmfsmoothq ] ) as a modified poisson s equation , @xmath84 based on the smoothed total charge density .",
    "this point was first made for the uniformly - charged - wall model system  @xcite , and it is immediately generalizable to the lmf  equation dealt with here .",
    "the existence of this poisson - like equation dictating a modified electrostatics emphasizes that , in order for lmf  theory to be valid for electrostatics , _ all _ charge - charge interactions , whether fixed , bound , or mobile , should be mapped via lmf  theory to short - ranged interactions in the restructured electrostatic potential @xmath65 . in  @xcite , we emphasized the value of this modified - electrostatics perspective in physically interpreting molecular simulations and in understanding why and when spherical gaussian truncations , using @xmath36  alone , fail in nonuniform environments .",
    "understanding the lmf  equation as standard electrostatics for a gaussian - smoothed charge density also allows for simpler solutions of the lmf  equation than might be initially expected . as an example , in  @xcite , we were able to use a one - dimensional lmf  equation to treat a system that has a charge density profile with an explicitly three - dimensional character . in this section",
    ", we give the reasoning behind such simplifications and argue that they should be expected generally in many physically relevant cases .      in  @xcite , we treated spc / e water confined to a slab by two empirical pt(111 ) surfaces  @xcite that order the water molecules at the surface , attracting the oxygen atoms to localized binding sites .",
    "details of the simulation methods are available in  @xcite . in brief , we simulated 1054 spc / e molecules confined between the two walls with 500 ps of equilibration and 1.5 ns of subsequent data collection .",
    "simulations using slab - corrected three - dimensional ewald sums , lmf theory with @xmath85   , and lmf theory with @xmath86    were carried out . during those runs ,",
    "the timestep chosen was 1.0 fs .",
    "however , for self - consistent solution of the lmf equation , we first simulated sets of 10 shorter runs with 25 ps of equilibration and 50 ps of accumulation with a timestep of 2.5 fs .",
    "these 10 shorter runs began with distinct initial conditions ; we observed that averaging the @xmath67  resulting from such a set of simulations better isolated the system s equilibrium response to changes in @xmath65  from the natural fluctuations in the charge density .",
    "for the larger @xmath0 , convergence was achieved within 3 iterations , and for the smaller @xmath0 , 10 iterations were required for self - consistency .",
    "this approach certainly does not represent a numerically optimized solution of the lmf equation and is used here only to demonstrate the accuracy possible in principle when the full lmf theory is used .",
    "we will address the need for a more comprehensive and numerically efficient approach to the solution of the lmf  equation and general timing issues further in section  [ sxn : conc ] .",
    "in contrast to the smooth hydrophobic surface also dealt with in that paper , the empirical ( 111 ) surface was intended to represent detailed and specific ordering of water molecules at an atomically - corrugated surface .",
    "a schematic of the rectangular unit cell of a ( 111 ) surface is shown in figure  [ fig : ptunit ] , demonstrating the spacing of the three topmost layers of atoms .",
    "the empirical pt(111 ) potential  @xcite that we use does not have explicit atoms or charges .",
    "rather the potential simply encompasses the presence of binding sites through exponential functions and various cosine functions to represent the periodicity of the surface .",
    "as expected from the form of the potential , the charge density @xmath67   depends on @xmath87 and @xmath88 in addition to @xmath89 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ptchgplot ] , the charge density @xmath90 in the 1.5   layer nearest the ( 111)-wall is projected onto a unit cell . as previously demonstrated  @xcite , the surface induces a charge density profile very nonuniform in the @xmath87- and @xmath88-directions .",
    "the distinct periodicity is due to the fact that the spacing between binding sites ( 2.77   ) is nearly commensurate with the first peak in the bulk water @xmath91 ( @xmath92 2.8   ) .",
    "however despite a charge density that was explicitly a function of @xmath14 , we obtained accurate results for system properties using @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "we posited that this was the case due to the charge smoothing described in the previous section .    here",
    "we seek to demonstrate this more quantitatively by probing the charge density profile away from the surface within hexagonal prisms defined by three distinct hexagonal binding regions ",

    ", convoluting @xmath96 with gaussians in the @xmath87- and @xmath88-directions and subsequently analyzing sites a , b , and c leads to a density , @xmath97 , that is indistinguishable from the @xmath98 calculated initially as only a function of @xmath89 .",
    "this equivalence is due to that fact that the corrugations in effect induce local random noise in the density profile that is therefore averaged out by the gaussians of width greater than the corrugation .",
    "in contrast , the presence of the confining surface leads to a @xmath71 density profile that does not average out in the @xmath89-direction as seen in figure  [ fig : ptsmoothchg]c .",
    "in essence , the lmf  smoothing approach shows when variations in charge density profiles cancel , and when they do not .",
    "however , a reasonable criticism of the previous surface is that it was not atomically realistic , even on a classical level .",
    "more realistic metallic surfaces would require a treatment of image charges , which we will not address here .",
    "however , molecular surfaces modeled with standard force fields would at least have charges at atomic sites near the surface .",
    "if the charges are free to move throughout the simulation as would generally be the case for biological membranes or liquid - liquid interfaces , absolutely no change in tactic would be necessary .",
    "the charges associated with those molecules would also be included in the mobile @xmath67 .    if , instead , the charges are held fixed , as is more likely for solid surfaces in classical simulations of solid - liquid interfaces , then @xmath99 . in such cases ,",

    "the similarity of the electrostatic potential surface for each @xmath0  to the full ewald calculation demonstrates that 4.5    is greater than @xmath46  for the fixed surface at least .",

    "the agreement between @xmath138 and @xmath139 is expected but numerically nontrivial since @xmath140 at this distance above the surface .",

    ", we will examine the application of lmf  theory to bulk site - site fluids in much more detail  @xcite and also demonstrate very simple corrections that allow much more accurate thermodynamics from gt models  @xcite .",
    "another area which we hope to explore in greater detail is methods for optimally solving the lmf  equation during simulation . as alluded to in  @xcite , the writing of the lmf  equation as a poisson equation with a gaussian smoothed charge density suggests that connection with work on efficient poisson solvers would be numerically helpful , and that simple approximations may prove surprisingly accurate  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since poisson s equation may be written as the minimum of a functional  @xcite , using a modified car - parinello scheme  @xcite to _ slowly _ evolve to the _ averaged , equilibrium _ solution of the lmf  equation seems like another fruitful path to pursue . in our ( unoptimized ) simulations of lmf  systems , we observed a speed - up of at least a factor of four relative to ewald summation .",
