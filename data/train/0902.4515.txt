    "qcd is a challenging theory .",
    "its most interesting aspects , namely the confinement of color and the chiral symmetry breaking , have defied all analytical approaches .",
    "while there are now many data accumulated from the lattice gauge theory , the methodology falls well short of giving us insights on how one may understand these phenomena analytically , nor does it give us a systematic way of obtaining a low energy theory of qcd below the confinement scale .    a very useful approach in the conventional field theory language",
    "is the chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it bypasses the question of how the confinement and the symmetry breaking occur but rather focuses on the implications .",
    "a quark bilinear condenses to break the chiral symmetry @xmath2 to its diagonal subgroup @xmath3 , where by @xmath4 goldstone bosons appear , which we will refer to as pions .",
    "they are singled out as the lightest physical particles , and one guesses and constrains an effective lagrangian for them . in the massless limit ] with a matrix @xmath5 , which in our holographic approach would be ignored .",
    "] of the bare quarks , the pions are packaged into a unitary matrix as @xmath6 whose low energy action is written in a derivative expansion as @xmath7 ^ 2+\\cdots\\right)\\:,\\ ] ] where the ellipsis denotes higher derivative terms as well as other possible quartic derivative terms .",
    "one can further add other massive mesons whose masses and interaction strengths are all left as free parameters to fit with data .",
    "another analytical approach is the large @xmath0 expansion @xcite . here , two different couplings @xmath1 and @xmath8 control the perturbation expansion , one counting the topology of the feynman diagram and the other counting loops .",
    "an interesting question is how this large @xmath0 limit appears in the chiral lagrangian approach .",
    "since the pion fields ( or any other meson fields that one can add ) are already color - singlets , @xmath0 would enter only via the numerical coefficients of the various terms in the lagrangian .",
    "both terms shown in ( [ skyrme ] ) can arise from planar diagrams of large @xmath0 expansion , and we expect @xmath9 note that since @xmath10 and @xmath11 play the role of squared couplings for canonically normalized pions , the self - coupling of pions scales as @xmath12 @xcite . in particular , this shows that baryons are qualitatively different than mesons in the large @xmath0 chiral perturbation theory .",
    "baryons involves @xmath0 number of quarks , so the mass is expected to grow linearly with @xmath0 , or equivalently grows with the inverse square of pion self - couplings . in field theories , such a scaling behavior is a hallmark of nonperturbative solitons .    indeed , it has been proposed early on that baryons are topological solitons , namely skyrmions @xcite , whose baryon number is cataloged by the third homotopy group of @xmath3 , @xmath13 .",
    "the topological winding is counted by how many times @xmath14 covers a noncollapsible three - sphere in @xmath3 manifold , as a function on @xmath15 .",
    "given such topological data , one must find a classical solution that minimizes the energy of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate for the size @xmath16 of a skyrmion gives @xmath17 which is independent of large @xmath0 .",
    "however , let us pose and consider whether this construction really makes sense .",
    "this solitonic picture says that baryons can be regarded as coherent states of goldstone bosons of qcd . although the latter are special due to the simple and universal origin and also due to the light mass , they are one of many varieties of bi - quark mesons .",
    "in particular , there are known and experimentally measured cubic couplings between pions and heavier spin one mesons , such @xmath18 mesons .",
    "a condensate of pions , as in a skyrmion , would shows up as a source term for a @xmath18 meson equation of motion and @xmath18 must be also have its own coherent state excited . in turn",
    ", this will disturb the conventional skyrmion picture and modify it quantitatively .",
    "this is a clear signal that the usual skyrmion picture of the baryon has to be modified significantly in the context of full qcd .",
    "perhaps because of this , and perhaps for other reasons , the picture of baryon as skyrmion have produced mixed results when compared to experimental data . in this note , we will explore how this problem is partially cured , in a natural and simple manner without new unknown parameter , and how the resulting baryons look qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of skyrmion .",
    "as we will see , the holographic picture naturally brings a gauge - principle in the bulk description of the flavor dynamics in such a way that all spin one mesons as well as pions would enter the construction of baryons on the equal footing . the basic concept of baryon as coherent states of mesons",
    "would remain unchanged , however .",
    "it is the purpose of this note to outline this new approach to baryons and to explore the consequences .",
    "a holographic qcd is similar to the chiral perturbation theory in the sense that we deal with exclusively gauge - invariant operators of the theory .",
    "the huge difference is , however , that this new approach tends to treat all gauge - invariant objects together .",
    "not only the light meson fields like pions but also heavy vector mesons and baryons appear together , at least in principle .",
    "in other words , a holographic qcd deals with all color - singlets simultaneously , giving us a lot more predictive power .",
    "later we will see examples of this more explicitly .",
    "this new approach is motivated by the large @xmath0 limit of gauge theories @xcite and in particular by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "one of the more interesting notion that emerged in this regard over the last three decades is the concept of _ the master field_. the idea is that in the large @xmath19 limits of matrix theories with a gauge symmetry , the gauge - singlet observables behaves semiclassically in the large @xmath19 limit @xcite .",
    "probably the most astounding twist is the emergence of a new spatial direction in such a picture . as we learned from ads",
    "/ cft , _ the master fields _ have to be thought of not as four - dimensional fields but at least five - dimensional , with the additional direction being labeled by energy scale .",
    "we refer to this new direction as the holographic direction .",
    "the standard ads / cft duality gives us a precise equivalence between the large @xmath0 maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theories and the type iib string theory or iib supergravity in ads@xmath20 . here , _",
    "the master fields _ are nothing but closed string fields such as the gravity multiplet and excited closed string fields .",
    "it is also believed that such a duality extends to other large @xmath19 field theories such as ordinary qcd which is neither supersymmetric nor conformal .",
    "the question is then how to find the right dual theory of the large @xmath0 qcd .",
    "one set of ideas for this , dubbed bottom - up @xcite , is similar in spirit to the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "one assumes that an approximate conformal symmetry exists for a wide range of energy scales and build up a bulk gravity theory coupled to more bulk fields , as would be dictated by the ads / cft rules if qcd were conformal . the conformal symmetry is subsequently broken by cutting off the geometry at both the infrared and the ultraviolet and by introducing boundary conditions .",
    "necessary degrees of freedoms , namely the master fields , are introduced as needed by construction , rather than derived , and in this sense the approach is similar to the conventional chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the other approach is referred to as top - down , and here one tries to realized the qcd as a low energy limit of some open string theory on d - branes , from which a holographic model follows as the closed string theory dual .",
    "arguably , the best model of this kind we know of is the d4-d8 system , where @xmath21 d4 gauge theory compactified on a thermal circle provides large @xmath0 yang - mills sector .",
    "the @xmath3 gauge theory on d8 brane , on the other hand , can be thought of bi - quark meson sector in the adjoint representation of the @xmath3 flavor symmetry .",
    "a crucial aspect of this model , although to be expected from general ads / cft principles , is that the vector - like flavor symmetry is promoted to a gauge theory in the bulk .",
    "this d4-d8 model was slowly developed over the years , starting with witten s initial identification of the dual geometry for d4 branes wrapped on a thermal circle @xcite , study of glueball mass spectra of pure qcd without matter @xcite , the introduction of mesons via d8 branes @xcite , and very recent study of baryons as solitonic objects @xcite on d8 branes . in this section , we will review glueballs and mesons in this d4-d8 model .",
    "the story starts with a stack of d4 branes which is compactified on a circle .",
    "the circle here is sometimes called  thermal \" in that one requires anti - periodic boundary condition on all fermions , just as one would for the euclidean time circle when studying finite temperature field theory .",
    "the purpose of having a spatial  thermal \" circle is to give mass to the fermionic superpartners and thus break supersymmetry .",
    "as is well known , the low energy theory on @xmath19 d@xmath22 branes is a maximally supersymmetric @xmath23 yang - mills theory in @xmath24 dimensions , so putting @xmath0 d4 branes on a thermal circle , we obtains pure @xmath21 yang - mills theory in the noncompact @xmath25 dimensions .",
    "we are interested in large @xmath0 limit , so the @xmath26 part can be safely ignored , and we may pretend that we are studying @xmath27 theory instead . while the anti - periodic boundary condition generates massgap only to fermionic sector at tree level , scalar partners also become massive since there is no symmetry to prohibit their mass any more . only the gauge multiplet is protected .",
    "we then extrapolate the general idea of ads / cft to this non - conformal case , which states that , instead of studying strongly coupled large @xmath0 yang - mills theory , one may look at its dual closed string theory . the correct closed string background to use is nothing but the string background generated by the d4 branes in question .",
    "this geometry was first written down by gibbons and maeda @xcite in the 1980 s , and later reinterpreted by witten in 1998 as the dual geometry for d4 branes on a thermal circle @xcite .",
    "the metric is most conveniently written as @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the topology of the spacetime is @xmath31 , with the coordinate @xmath32 labeling the azimuthal angle of the disk @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the circle parameterized by @xmath32 is the thermal circle .",
    "the dilaton is @xmath36 while the antisymmetric ramond - ramond background field @xmath37 is such that @xmath38 carries @xmath0 unit of flux along @xmath39 .",
    "[ 0.5 ] and the radial coordinate @xmath40 .",
    "the thermal circle spanned by @xmath32 closes itself in the infrared end due to the strong interaction of qcd .",
    "small excitations of metric ( and its multiplet ) at the infrared end correspond to glueballs .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    -2.0 cm    in the limit of large curvature radius , thus large @xmath0 , and in the limit of large t hooft coupling @xmath41 , the duality collapse to a relationship between the theory of d4 branes to type iia supergravity defined in this background .",
    "given the lack of useful method of string theory quantization in curved background , this is the best we can do at the moment .",
    "therefore , all computations in any of holographic qcd must assume such a limit and extrapolate to realistic regime at the end of the computation .",
    "this is also the route that we follow in this note .    among remarkable works in early days of ads",
    "/ cft is the study of glueball spectra in this background @xcite .",
    "they considered small fluctuations of iia gravity multiplet in the above background , with the plane - wave like behavior along @xmath42 and @xmath43 normalizability along the remaining six directions .",
    "they identified each of such modes as glueballs up to spin 2 , and computed their mass@xmath44 eigenvalues as dictated by the linearized gravitational equation of motion .",
    "this illustrates what is going on here .",
    "we can think of the duality here as a simple statement that the open string side and the closed string side is one and the same theory .",
    "the reason we have apparently more complicated description on the open string side is because there we started with a misleading and redundant set of elementary fields , namely the gauge field whose number scales as @xmath45 , only to be off - set by the gauge symmetry . the closed string side , or its gravity limit , happens to be more smart about what are the right low energy degrees of freedom and encodes only gauge - invariant ones . for pure yang - mills theory like this , the only gauge - invariant objects are glueballs , so the dual gravitational side should compute the glueball physics .",
    "the expectation that there exists a more intelligent theory consisting only of gauge - invariant objects in the large @xmath0 limit is thus realized via string theory in a somewhat surprising manner that _ the master fields _ , those truly physical degrees of freedom , actually live not in four dimensional minkowskian world but in five or higher dimensional curved geometry .",
    "this is not however completely unanticipated , and was heralded in the celebrated work by eguchi and kawai in early 1980 s @xcite which is all the more remarkable in retrospect . for the rest of this note , we will continue this path and try to incorporate massless quarks to the story .",
    "to add mesons , sakai and sugimoto introduced the @xmath46 d8 branes , which share the coordinates @xmath42 with the above d4 branes @xcite and are transverse to the thermal circle @xmath32 .",
    "before we trade off the @xmath0 d4 branes in favor of the dual gravity theory , this would have allowed massless quark as open strings ending on both the d4 and the d8 branes .",
    "as the d4 s are replaced by the dual geometry , however , the 4 - 8 open strings have to be paired up into 8 - 8 open strings , which are naturally identified as bi - quark mesons . from the viewpoint of d8 branes , the lightest of such mesons belong to a @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "the @xmath3 gauge theory on d8 branes has the action @xmath47 where the contraction is via the induced metric of d8 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the induced metric on the d8 brane is @xmath50 after we trade off the holographic ( or radial ) coordinate @xmath40 in favor of a conformal one @xmath51 as @xmath52 which resides in a finite interval of length @xmath53 where @xmath54 thus , the topology of the @xmath55 worldvolume is @xmath56 .",
    "the nominal yang - mills coupling @xmath57 is related to the other parameters as @xmath58 which is not , however , a physical parameter on its own .",
    "the low energy parameters of this holographic theory are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which together with @xmath0 sets all the physical scales such as the qcd scale and the pion decay constant .",
    "[ 0.5 ]    -2.0 cm    in the low energy limit , we ignore @xmath39 direction on which d8 s are completely wrapped , and find a five - dimensional yang - mills theory with a chern - simons term @xmath61 where the position - dependent yang - mills coupling of this flavor gauge theory is @xmath62 with @xmath63 the position - dependent volume of @xmath39 .",
    "the chern - simons coupling with @xmath64 arises because @xmath65 .",
    "as advertised , this by itself generates many of bi - quark mesons of qcd .",
    "more specifically , all of vector and axial - vector mesons and the pion multiplet are encoded in this five - dimensional @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "the vector mesons and the axial vector mesons are more straightforward conceptually , since any  compactification \" of five - dimensional yang - mills theory would lead to an infinite tower of four - dimensional massive vector fields .",
    "although the radial direction @xmath51 ( or @xmath40 ) is infinite in terms of proper length , equation of motion is such that normalizable fields are strongly pushed away from the boundary , making it effectively a compact direction . the usual kaluza - klein reduction ( in the somewhat illegal but convenient axial gauge @xmath66 )",

    "this fitting , all other infinite number of masses and coupling constants are fixed .",
    "this version of the holographic qcd is extremely predictive .",
    "let us emphasize that the meson system here comes with a qualification .",
    "note that we treated d8 branes differently than d4 branes .",
    "the latter are replaced by the dual geometry while the former are kept as branes .",
    "this has to be because we are interested in objects charged under @xmath3 , whereas we are only interested in singlets under @xmath21 .",
    "however , we not only treated d8 as branes but also as probe branes , meaning that the backreaction of d8 to the dual geometry of d4 s is ignored . in terms of field theory language",
    ", we effectively ignored feynman diagrams involving quarks in the internal lines , resulting in the quenched approximation .",
    "the baryon can be naturally regarded as a coherent state of mesons in the large @xmath0 . in the conventional chiral lagrangian approach , is the skyrmion made from pions , which we argued can not be the full picture . in d4-d8 model of holographic qcd",
    "above , especially , pions are only zero mode part of a holographic flavor theory , and infinite towers of vector and axial - vector mesons are packaged together with pions into a single five - dimensional @xmath3 gauge field .",
    "this suggests that the picture of baryon as a soliton must be lifted to a five - dimensional soliton of this @xmath3 gauge theory in the bulk , in such a manner that spin one mesons contribute to construction of baryons as well . in this section , we explore classical and quantum properties of this holographic and new version of skyrmion .      the five - dimensional effective action for the @xmath3 gauge field in eq .",
    "( [ five ] ) admits solitons which carry a pontryagin number @xmath86 with integral @xmath87 .",

    "the smallest unit with @xmath91 turns out to carry quantum numbers of the baryon .",
    "the easiest way to see this identification is to relate it to the skyrmion @xcite of the chiral perturbation theory .",

    "recall that the @xmath40 field of chiral perturbation theory is obtained in our holographic picture as the open and infinite wilson line along @xmath51 direction . on the other hand",
    ", the wilson line computes nothing but @xmath97 , so we find that @xmath98 carries @xmath87 skyrmion number exactly when @xmath99 carries @xmath87 pontryagin number .",
    "therefore , the instanton soliton in five dimensions is the holographic image of the skyrmions in four dimensions",
    ". we will call it the instanton soliton .",
    "normal instantons on a conformally flat four - manifold are well studied , and the counting of zero modes says that for @xmath87 instanton in @xmath3 theory , there are @xmath100 collective coordinates . for the minimal case with @xmath91 and @xmath101 , giving us eight collective coordinates .",
    "they are four translations , one overall size , and three gauge rotations . for our instanton solitons ,",

    "this by itself would collapse the soliton to a point - like one , making further analysis impossible .",
    "a second difference comes from the presence of the additional chern - simons term @xmath108 , whereby the pontryagin density @xmath109 sources some of the gauge field @xmath70 minimally .",
    "this electric charge density costs the coulombic energy @xmath110 again in the limit of @xmath111 .",
    "this coulombic energy tends to favor larger soliton size , which competes against the shrinking force due to @xmath112 .",

    "this small soliton size is still much larger than its own compton size @xmath117 , justifying our assertion that this is indeed a soliton .",
    "note that the instanton soliton size is much smaller that the skyrmion size when the t hooft coupling is large . is determined at @xmath118 meson scale and independent of @xmath60 , due to the vector dominance .",
    "one may think of these solitonic sizes as being hadronic .",

    "this truncation can be justified for processes involving low energy pions .",
    "the baryon is , however , a heavy object and contains highly excited modes of pions , and will excite relatively light vector mesons as well since @xmath40 is coupled to vector and axial - vector mesons nontrivially at cubic level .",

    ". we will consider implication of this new picture of the baryon in next sections .",
    "our solitonic picture of the baryon has a close tie to the usual ads / cft picture of baryons as wrapped d - branes .",

    "this shows that the background @xmath38 flux over @xmath39 induces @xmath0 unit of the electric charge . on the other hand , the gauss constraint for @xmath126 demands that the net charge should be zero , so",
    "the wrapped d4@xmath121 can exist only if @xmath0 end points of fundamental strings are attached to d4@xmath121 to cancel this charge . in turn , the other ends of the fundamental strings must go somewhere , and the only place it can go is d8 branes .",
    "one can think of these strings as individual quarks that constitute the baryon .",
    "also , because of these fundamental strings , the wrapped d4@xmath121 can not be separated from d8 s without a lot of energy cost .",
    "the lowest energy state would be one where d4@xmath121 is on top of d8 s , which then would smear out as an instanton .",
    "the latter is exactly the instanton soliton of ours .      for the sake of simplicity , and also because the quarks in this model have no bare mass , we will take @xmath101 for the rest of the note .",
    "a unit instanton soliton in question comes with six collective coordinates .",
    "three correspond to the position in @xmath15 , and three correspond to the gauge angles in @xmath127 .",

    "@xcite for mass spectra of some excited instanton solitons .",
    "the solitonic baryon is a coherent object which is made up of pions as well as of vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "this implies that the structure of the soliton itself contains all the information on how the baryon interacts with these infinite tower of mesons .",
    "this sort of approach has been also used @xcite in the skyrmion picture of old days , where , for instance , the leading axial coupling for a nucleon emitting a soft pion was computed following such thoughts .",
    "the difference here is that , instead of just pions , all spin one mesons enter this holographic construction of the baryon , and this enables us to compute all low energy meson - hadron vertices simultaneously .",

    "the magnetic monopoles @xcite appear as solitons in non - abelian yang - mills theories spontaneously broken to a subgroup containing a @xmath26 factor , such as in @xmath151 , and carries a magnetic charge .",
    "usually it is a big and fluffy object and must be treated as a classical object . however , if we push the electric yang - mills coupling to be large enough , so that the magnetic monopole size become comparable or even smaller than the symmetry breaking scale , we have no choice but to treat it as a point - like object .",
    "the effective action for this monopole field @xmath152 ( spinless for example ) should contain at least , @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the dual photon of the unbroken @xmath26 gauge field .",
    "we know this coupling exists simply because the monopole has the magnetic charge @xmath155 .",
    "but how do we know the latter fact ? because the soliton solution itself exhibits a long range magnetic coulomb tail of the form @xmath156 if we replace the solitonic monopole by the quanta of the field @xmath152 but do not couple to the dual photon field as above , we would end up with a local excitation .",
    "however , a magnetic monopole ( or an electrically charge particle ) is not really a local object .",
    "creating one always induces the corresponding long range magnetic ( electric ) coulomb field . to ensure that the effective field theory represent the magnetic monopole accurately ,",
    "we must make sure that creating a quanta of @xmath152 is always followed by creation of the necessary magnetic coulomb field .",
    "this is achieved by coupling the local field @xmath152 to the gauge field @xmath154 at an appropriate strength .",
    "this is a somewhat unconventional way to understand the origin of the minimal coupling of the monopole to the dual gauge field @xmath154 .      before going further ,",
    "let us briefly pose and ask about the validity of such an approach for our solitonic baryon .",
    "the key to this is a set of inequalities among three natural scales that enter the baryon physics , which are @xmath157 they hold in the large @xmath0 and large @xmath60 limit .",
    "the first is the length scale of mesons , the second is the classical size of the solitonic baryon , and the third is the compton wavelength of the baryon since its mass is @xmath158 .",
    "the first inequality tells us that the baryon tends to be much smaller than mesons and thus can be regarded almost pointlike when interacting with mesons .",
    "this justifies the effective field theory approach where we think of each baryon as small excitation of a field .",
    "one does this precisely when the object in question can be treated as if it has no internal structure other than quantum numbers like spins .",
    "the second inequality tells us that the quantum uncertainty associated with the baryon is far smaller than the classical core size of the soliton .",
    "this is important because , otherwise , one may not be able to trust anything about the classical features of the soliton at quantum level .",
    "when the second inequality holds , it enables us to make use of the classical shape of the soliton and to extract information about how meson interact with the baryon .",
    "the fact we have a small soliton size and an even smaller compton size of that soliton is very fortunate .      as with the small magnetic monopole case , we wish to trade off the ( quantized ) instanton soliton in favor of local baryon field(s ) and make sure to encode the long - range tails of the soliton in how the baryon field(s ) interacts with the low energy gauge fields .",
    "our instanton soliton has two types of distinct but related long - range field .",
    "the first is due to the pontryagin density and goes like @xmath159 while the second is the coulomb field due to the chern - simons coupling between @xmath70 and @xmath109 , @xmath160 the latter is the five - dimensional analog of the electric coulomb tail .",
    "apart from the fact that we have two kinds of long - range fields , there is another important difference from the monopole case . as we saw in section 3.2 ,",
    "the solitonic baryon has @xmath135 worth of internal moduli , quantization of which gave us the various spin / isospin baryons .",
    "since the gauge direction of the magnetic long range field is determined by coordinate on @xmath135 , the field strengths associated with the pontryagin density should be smeared out by quantum fluctuation along the moduli space .",
    "it is crucial for our purpose that what we mean by long - range fields of the instanton soliton are actually these quantum counterpart , not the naive classical one .",
    "basic features of the smearing out effect and relevant identities can be found in next subsection .",
    "the electric coulomb tail should be encoded in a minimal coupling to the abelian part of @xmath70 . for a spin",
    "/ isospin half baryon , @xmath161 , we anticipate a minimal term of the form @xmath162 this is uniquely fixed by the coulomb charge @xmath0 and the @xmath127 representation of the quantized instanton .",
    "the purely magnetic tail of the soliton is more subtle to deal with . from the simple power counting ,",
    "it is obvious that the coupling responsible for such a tail must have one higher dimension than the minimal coupling , hinting at the field strength @xmath88 of the @xmath127 part coupling directly to a baryon bilinear , such as @xmath163 it turns out that this is precisely the right structure to mimic the long - range magnetic fields of quantized instantons and anti - instantons .    to show that the latter vertex is indeed the precisely right one",
    ", one must consider the following points .",
    "( 1 ) is this the unique term that can reproduce the correct quantum - smeared long - range instanton and anti - instanton tail ? ( 2 ) if so , how do we fix the coefficient , taking into account the quantum effects .",
    "( 3 ) and is the estimate reliable ?",
    "the answers are long and technical .",
    "we refer the readers to literatures @xcite for precise answers to these questions , but here state that the answers are all affirmative and that the effective action of mesons and baryons is uniquely determined by this simple consideration .",
    "this is true at least in the large @xmath0 and the large @xmath60 limit .",
    "this leads to the following five - dimensional effective action , @xmath164\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\int d^4 x   dw { 1\\over 4 e^2(w ) } \\;{\\rm tr}\\ , { \\cal f}_{mn}{\\cal f}^{mn}\\ , , \\label{5d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the covariant derivative given as @xmath165 with @xmath166 in the fundamental representation of @xmath127 .",

    "this is the limit where the above effective action is trustworthy .",
    "we find @xmath168 so the last term involving baryons can be actually dominant over the minimal coupling , despite that it looks subleading in the derivative expansion . as it turns out ,",
    "this term is dominant for cubic vertex processes involving pions or axial vector mesons , whereas the minimal coupling dominates for those involving vector mesons @xcite .",
    "we have discussed general ideas behind the effective action approach and given the explicit results for isospin 1/2 case .",
    "the only term that is not obvious is the coupling between baryons and the field strength @xmath88 , with the coefficient @xmath169 , and we would like to spend a little more time on its origin . apart from convincing readers that the derivation of the effective action is actually rigorous ,",
    "this would also allow us to outline how the result generalizes for higher isospin baryons , such @xmath170 particles , as well .",
    "each and every quantum of the baryon field @xmath161 is supposed to represent a quantized ( anti-)instanton soliton .",
    "let us recall that the quantization of the soliton involves finding wavefunctions on the moduli space of the soliton , which is @xmath171 . since the moduli encode the gauge direction of the instanton soliton , the classical gauge field is quantum mechanically smeared and should be replaced by its expectation values as @xmath172 with @xmath173 $ ] .",

    "although we did not write so explicitly , isospin triplet mesons and singlet mesons have different coupling strength to the nucleons , so there are actually two sets of couplings @xmath222 , one for isosinglet mesons , such as @xmath223 and @xmath224 , and the other for isotriplet mesons , such as @xmath18 and @xmath225 .",

    "mesons and nucleons has been worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite and further elaborated recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the leading axial coupling to pions , @xmath219 , is somewhat better measured at @xmath236 .",
    "our prediction is @xcite @xmath237 where the leading term arise from the direct coupling to the field strength @xmath88 and the ellipsis denotes the subleading and higher correction .",
    "while this does not look too good , we must remember that this holographic model is effectively a quenched qcd , missing out on possible @xmath238 corrections . from old studies of large @xmath0 constituent models ,",
    "a group theoretical @xmath238 correction has been proposed for this type of operators , which states that the next leading correction would amounts to @xmath239 .",
    "so , in a more realistic version where we take into account of the backreaction of d8 branes on the dual geometry , we may anticipate for @xmath150 @xmath240 finally , @xmath241 is partly captured by the minimal coupling term our quenched model , which turns out to give roughly a 10% positive correction , making the total very close to the measured quantity 1.26 .",
    "these two illustrate nicely what kind of predictions can be made and how accurate their predictions can be when compared to experimental data .",
    "much more rich array of predictions exist , such as other cubic couplings between mesons and baryons , anomalous magnetic moment @xcite , complete vector dominance of electromagnetic form factors @xcite , and detailed prediction on momentum dependence of such form factors @xcite .",
    "however , one should be a bit more cautious .",
    "the model , as an approximation to real qcd , has many potential defects .",
    "the main problem is that all of this is in the context of large @xmath0 and that any prediction , such as above two , has to involve an extensive extrapolation procedure .",
    "many ambiguities can be found in such a procedure , and we chose a particular strategy of computing all quantities and analytically continuing the final expressions for the amplitudes to realistic qcd regime .",
    "the fact it works remarkably well does not really support its validity in any rigorous sense .",
    "also the d4-d8 model we employed include many massive fields which are not part of ordinary four - dimensional qcd , and one should be cautious in using the holographic qcd for physics other than simple low energy processes .",
    "despite such worries , the d4-d8 holographic qcd turned out to be far better than one may have anticipated .",
    "we have shown how it accommodates not only the ( vector ) meson sector but the baryon sector very competently . whether or not the holographic qcd can be elevated to a controlled and justifiable approximation to real qcd remains to be seen , depending crucially on having a better understanding of the string theory in the curved spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , it is fair to say that we finally have a rough grasp of the physics that controls _ the master fields _ , and perhaps this insight by itself will lead to a better and more practical formulation of the qcd in the future .",
    "holographic baryons and their effective action in the bulk also encodes how baryons , and in particular , nucleons would interact with electromagnetism . for this",
    ", one follows the usual procedure of ads / cft where operators in the field theory are matched up with non - normalizable modes of bulk fields .",
    "operationally , one simply introduces the boundary photon field @xmath185 as a nonnormalizable mode , which adds to @xmath79-term in the expansion of @xmath70 , @xmath242 and repeat the dimensional reduction to the four dimensions .",
    "for instance , computation of anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron can be done with relative ease , and gives remarkably good agreement with measured values @xcite .    for more detailed accounts of electromagnetic properties of baryon",
    ", we refer the readers to refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will only consider the most notable feature of the electromagnetic properties , namely the complete vector dominance , whereby all electromagnetic interactions are entirely mediated by the infinite tower of vector mesons .",
    "this also illustrate well how the holographic qcd can give a sweeping and qualitative prediction and also where it could fail .",
    "the vector dominance means that there is no point - like charge , which , in view of the minimal coupling between @xmath70 and @xmath161 in ( [ 5d ] ) , sounds pretty odd . to understand what s going on",
    ", one must consider quadratic structures in the vector meson sector .",
    "defining @xmath243 for parity even eigenfunctions @xmath244 s , the quadratic part of the vector meson is @xcite @xmath245\\;,\\ ] ] where we introduced the shifted vector fields @xmath246 this mixing of vector mesons and photon is at the heart of the vector dominance .",
    "( the axial - vector mesons , @xmath247 s , do not mix with photon because of the parity . )    now let us see how this mixing of vector fields enters the coupling of baryons with electromagnetic vector field @xmath185 .",
    "taking the minimal coupling , we find @xmath248 where the ellipsis denotes axial couplings to axial vectors as well as coupling to pions via @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "@xmath251 is the cubic coupling between @xmath87-th vector meson and the baryon , or more precisely its leading contribution coming from the minimal coupling to @xmath70 .",
    "again , the presence of the direct minimal coupling to the photon @xmath185 seems to contradict the notion of vector dominance .",
    "however , it is advantageous to employ the canonically normalized vector fields @xmath252 in place of @xmath253 , upon which this becomes @xmath254 on the other hand , @xmath255 where we made use of the definite parities of @xmath103 and @xmath221 s and also of the completeness of @xmath221 s .",
    "this sum rule @xmath256 forces @xmath257 and the baryon couples to the photon field @xmath185 only via @xmath252 s which mixes with @xmath185 in their mass terms .",
    "this choice of basis is only for the sake of clarity .",
    "regardless of the basis , the above shows that no coupling between @xmath185 and @xmath161 can occur in the infinite momentum limit .",
    "this statement is clear in the @xmath258 basis which is diagonal if the mass term is negligible .",
    "alternatively , we can ask for the invariant amplitude of the charge form factor , to which the minimal coupling contributes @xcite @xmath259 with the momentum transfer @xmath260 . for small momentum transfer ,",
    "the first few light vector mesons dominate the form factors by mediating betwee the baryon and the photon .",
    "this end fit with experimental data pretty well .",
    "similar computation can be done for the magnetic form factor , from which one also finds the ( anomalous ) magnetic moment that fits the data pretty well @xcite .",
    "however , for large momentum transfer , the form factor decays as @xmath261 which is actually too slow for real qcd baryons .",
    "estimates based on the parton picture say that the decay should be @xmath262 .",
    "this dramatic failure of the form factor for large momentum regime should not be a big surprise .",
    "the theory we started with is a low energy limit of d4-d8 complex compactified ( with warp factors ) on @xmath263 . as such",
    ", one has to truncate infinite number of massive modes in order to reach a qcd - like theory in the boundary and must stay away from that cut - off scale to be safe from this procedure . for large momentum transfers ,",
    "say larger than @xmath59 , the computation we relied on has no real rationale .",
    "this should caution readers that the holographic qcd , at least in the limited forms that are available now , is not a fix for everything .",
    "one really must view it as a vastly improved version of the chiral lagrangian approach , with many hidden symmetries now manifest , but still suitable only for low energy physics .",
    "d4-d8 holographic model of qcd is the most successful model of its kind known .",
    "it reproduces in particular detailed particle physics of mesons and baryons .",
    "one reason for its success can be found in the fact that it builds on the the meson sector , the lightest of which is lighter than the natural cut - off scale @xmath59 .",
    "apart from @xmath1 and @xmath264 expansions imposed by general ads / cft ideas , one also must be careful with low energy expansion as well , because , we we stated before , the model includes many more massive kaluza - klein modes and even string modes that are not part of ordinary qcd .",
    "for low energy processes , nevertheless , one would hope that these extra massive states ( above @xmath59 ) do not contribute too much , which seems to be the case for low lying meson sector @xcite .",
    "our solitonic and holographic model of baryons elevates the classic skyrme picture based on pions to a unified model involving all spin one mesons in addition to pions .",
    "this is why the picture is extremely predictive . as we saw in this note , for low momentum processes , such as soft pion processes , soft rho meson exchanges , and soft elastic scattering of photons ,",
    "the model s predictions compare extremely well with experimental data .",
    "it is somewhat mysterious that the baryon sector works out almost as well as the meson sector , since baryons are much heavier than @xmath59 in the large @xmath0 and the large @xmath60 limit .",
    "note that the soliton underlying the baryon is nearly self - dual in the large @xmath60 limit .",
    "for instance , eq .  ( [ mass ] ) shows that the leading , would - be bps , mass is dominant over the rest by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "there must be a sense in which the soliton is approximately supersymmetric with respect to the underlying iia string theory , even though the background itself breaks all supersymmetry at scale @xmath59 .",
    "one may argue that even though there are many kk modes and even stringy modes lying between the naive cut - off scale @xmath59 and the baryon mass scale @xmath265 , these non - qcd degrees of freedom would be paired into approximate supermultiplets , reducing their potentially destructive effect , especially because the baryon itself is roughly bps .",
    "whether or not one can actually quantify such an idea for the model we have is unclear , but if possible it would be an important step toward rigorously validating holographic approaches to baryons in this d4-d8 set - up .",
    "there are more work to be done .",
    "one important direction is to perform more refined comparisons against experiments .",
    "in particular , extracting coupling constants from raw data seems quite dependent on theoretical models , and it is important to compute directly measurable amplitudes starting from the effective action of ours .",
    "nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitudes or more importantly the nucleon - nucleon potential would be a good place to start @xcite",
    ". another profitable path would be to consider dense system such as neutron stars as well as physics of light nuclei , where our model with far less tunable parameters would give unambiguous predictions .",

    "<S> we review baryons in the d4-d8 holographic model of low energy qcd , with the large @xmath0 and the large t hooft coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon is identified with a bulk soliton of a unit pontryagin number , which from the four - dimensional viewpoint translates to a modified skyrmion dressed by condensates of spin one mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we explore classical properties and find that the baryon in the holographic limit is amenable to an effective field theory description . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a simple method to capture all leading and subleading interactions in the @xmath1 and the derivative expansions . </S>",
    "<S> an infinitely predictive model of baryon - meson interactions is thus derived , although one may trust results only for low energy processes , given various approximations in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> we showcase a few comparisons to experiments , such the leading axial couplings to pions , the leading vector - like coupling , and a qualitative prediction of the electromagnetic vector dominance that involves the entire tower of vector mesons .    </S>",
