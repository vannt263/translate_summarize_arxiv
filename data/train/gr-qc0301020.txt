    "global , in a sense , solutions of the einstein equations constructed on the basis of the local solutions found in this paper are discussed in the subsequent one . there",
    "can occur two qualitatively different cases according to whether the dimension of @xmath2 is @xmath5 or @xmath6 . both of them , however , have an important feature in common , which makes reasonable to study them together .",

    "some remarkable properties of the reduced , accordingly with the above symmetry assumptions , vacuum einstein equations were discovered in 1978 . in particular , a suitable generalization of the inverse scattering transform , allowed to integrate the equations and to obtain solitary wave solutions @xcite .",
    "some physical consequences of these reduced equations were analyzed in a number of works ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this paper will be devoted to the analysis of @xmath9-integrable solutions , for which some partial results can be found in @xcite . in this case , the killing fields  interact  non - trivially one another ( for instance , @xmath13=y$ ] , for a suitable choice of the basis vectors in @xmath2 ) , while in the abelian case these fields are absolutely free ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath13=0 $ ] ) .",
    "hence , it is natural to expect that the former case is more rigid , with respect to the latter , and , as such , it allows a more complete analysis .",
    "it occurs to be the case , namely , metrics in question are parametrized by solutions of a linear equation in two independent variables , which , in its turn , depends linearly on a choice of a @xmath7-harmonic function .",
    "thus , this class of solutions has a  bilinear structure  and , hence , is subjected to two superposition laws . * in this case , assumption ii follows automatically from i and the local structure of this class of einstein metrics can be explicitly described .",
    "some well known exact solutions @xcite , such as , for instance , that of schwarzschild , belong to this class .",
