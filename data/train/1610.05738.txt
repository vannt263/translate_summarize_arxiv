    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in our universe has been well established by astrophysical and cosmological observations . to explain this , one needs some new particle(s ) and symmetries beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "being colorless and electrically neutral , sm - singlet right - handed neutrino ( rhn ) , introduced in seesaw models to explain the small neutrino mass , is a natural dm candidate .",
    "however in the conventional seesaw models@xcite , its yukawa couplings to sm lepton and higgs doublets make it highly unstable , and therefore , unsuitable for dm , unless its mass is in the kev range with appropriately small yukawa couplings@xcite . in ultraviolet",
    "( uv ) complete scenarios of seesaw , e.g. those based on the left - right ( lr ) gauge group @xmath2  @xcite , the gauge interactions of rhns induce further decay modes , which have to be suppressed / forbidden by imposing additional discrete symmetries ( or making the model more contrived ) to keep the lightest rhn cosmologically stable@xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss an alternative class of lr models based on the gauge group @xmath0  @xcite which has an accidental @xmath1 symmetry , at the renormalizable level that keeps the lightest rhn stable making it a natural dm candidate . in this model there",
    "exists a right - handed copy of the sm electroweak sector at the tev scale ( or higher ) , charged under @xmath3 .",
    "the breaking of this gauge symmetry down to @xmath4 is similar to the lr models with universal seesaw@xcite .",
    "but one of the key differences from the universal seesaw models is that the right - handed lepton sector in our model is prevented by gauge symmetry from having any masses connecting the heavy sector to the light ones .",
    "because of this , there appears a remnant automatic @xmath1 symmetry in the leptonic sector at the renormalizable level that keeps the lightest rhn stable .",
    "if the stabilizing @xmath1 symmetry is softly broken by a mass term connecting the heavy and light sector , the rhn dm can be made very long - lived but allowing for its decay into sm leptons .",
    "this raises the possibility that for a pev - scale dm , one can explain the ultra - high energy neutrino events observed at icecube  @xcite .",
    "we also point out a dilution mechanism which allows us to relax the unitarity bound on the dark matter to the pev mass level so that it can be applied to the discussion of pev neutrinos in the context of a thermal annihilating dm .",
    "the model is based on the gauge group @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite for each generation of sm fermions @xmath6 we have the heavy fermion partners @xmath7 the higgs sector of the model consists of @xmath8 doublets and triplets : @xmath9 the sm @xmath10 and new @xmath11 gauge symmetries are broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the neutral components of these higgs fields : @xmath12 the sm and heavy charged fermion masses are obtained through their yukawa couplings to the higgs doublets : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and similarly for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the second pauli matrix ) .",
    "exact parity symmetry implies that the yukawa couplings @xmath17 ( and also @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lyukawa2 ] ) below ) .",
    "if the @xmath11 symmetry breaking is at the tev scale , there would be new quarks in the few gev range , which is inconsistent with the current lhc bounds on vector - like fermion masses of order of tev . to have heavy quarks and leptons at the tev scale , we adopt the parity violating scenario in which the couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 are independent and choose @xmath21 .",
    "is responsible for the sm fermion masses and the other one @xmath22 dominates the heavy fermion masses  @xcite .",
    "] it is worth noting that at this stage the lower bound on @xmath23 from low - energy flavor changing effects such as @xmath24 mixing does not apply to our model .",
    "the masses of light and heavy neutrinos are generated from couplings to the triplet scalars @xmath25 via the type - ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite : @xmath26 which implies that the vev @xmath27 should be at the ev scale and @xmath28 is at the tev scale or above .",
    "this can be easily obtained by choosing appropriate values of the parameters in the scalar potential .",
    "after symmetry breaking at the right - handed scale and the electroweak scale , the model has a large global symmetry : @xmath29 , with the two @xmath30 the baryon numbers in the sm and heavy sectors , and the two @xmath1 s the corresponding lepton numbers .",
    "protected by the baryon number symmetry , the lightest hadron in the @xmath11 sector is absolutely stable , which can be one of the heavy baryons of form @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , or heavy mesons @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    for the phenomenological purpose of avoiding the heavy lightest baryon also becoming dm and affecting the evolution of the universe , we add two more higgs singlets @xmath36 and @xmath37 which connect the heavy and light singlet quarks via the terms @xmath38 once the @xmath39 fields acquire vevs , the heavy - light quark mass mixing terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 appear in the lagrangian , and the heavy quark can then decay into the sm fermions , leaving only the lightest rhn stable due to the leptonic @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the singlets @xmath42 are charged under @xmath43 and break this symmetry down to @xmath44 . at this stage",
    "this model is similar to the usual lr models with @xmath45 , however with the quantum number @xmath46 different from @xmath47 and also from the sm hypercharge @xmath48 ( which is a linear combination of @xmath46 and the @xmath49 subgroup of @xmath11 after symmetry breaking ) .",
    "the decay rate of heavy quarks @xmath50 can be estimated as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the sm weak mixing angle and @xmath53 is the gauge coupling of @xmath10 . requiring that the heavy quarks are depleted before the qcd phase transition epoch @xmath54 mev imposes a lower bound on the magnitude of @xmath55 gev  @xcite . when this limit is close to being saturated , we expect the heavy quark decay length to be several cm , leading to displaced vertex signatures at hadron colliders .",
    "in absence of any scalar and fermion mixings connecting the heavy and light sectors , the rhn @xmath56 interacts pairwise with the sm fermions only through the heavy @xmath57 boson , which couples directly to the sm sector through the @xmath58 interaction .",
    "once the mixing terms are included , at the lowest order , two @xmath56 s could also annihilate to the sm fields via the sm higgs @xmath59 and @xmath60 as well as the @xmath61 boson , induced due to the @xmath62 and @xmath63 mixings at tree level .",
    "the sm higgs @xmath59 is assumed to be predominantly from the doublet @xmath64 , and thus , the scalar mixing is expected to be of order @xmath65 from the quartic term @xmath66 , where for simplicity we have neglected the mixing with other scalars .",
    "the neutral gauge boson mixing is of order @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "note that when the gauge coupling @xmath69 approaches the theoretical lower limit  @xcite @xmath70 ( which is independent of the symmetry breaking pattern  @xcite ) , the @xmath63 mixing could be significantly enhanced .    in the minimal version of our model",
    ", we do not have the bi - multiplet scalars which transform non - trivially under both @xmath10 and @xmath11 , thus the charged gauge bosons @xmath71 and @xmath72 can not mix at the tree level .",
    "a tiny mixing arises at one - loop level , induce by the heavy - light quark mixings , which is estimated to be @xmath73 for the third generation quarks , and even smaller for the first and second generations .",
    "in the early universe , all the particles are in equilibrium due to the common @xmath74 color and @xmath58 interactions .",
    "as the universe cools down below the dm mass @xmath75 , the dm density goes down and freezes out , as in case of a generic thermal dm candidate .",
    "the primary annihilation channels to the sm particles proceed via the scalar and the neutral gauge boson portals : @xmath76 the @xmath59 and @xmath61 portals are suppressed respectively by the small mixing angles @xmath77 and @xmath78 . on the other hand , though the couplings of @xmath57 to @xmath56 and the sm fermions are of order one , the @xmath57 portal is suppressed by the large @xmath57 mass , except for the breit - wigner resonance when @xmath79 .",

    "in summary , we have discussed the phenomenology and cosmology of a new tev - scale rhn dm candidate in the context of an @xmath173 model , where we introduced an @xmath174 analog of the electroweak interaction and matter contents but with a common qcd .",
    "after symmetry breaking , there is an automatic @xmath175 symmetry in the leptonic sector that guarantees the stability of the lightest rhn , which plays the role of cold dm in the universe .",
    "the dm relic density and direct detection constraints imply a lower limit of order 1 tev for the rhn dm . we have also discussed a dilution mechanism which can push the rhn dark matter mass to the multi - pev range ( beyond the conventional unitarity limit ) so that together with a weak breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry , the rhn dm can in principle explain the pev neutrinos observed at icecube .",
