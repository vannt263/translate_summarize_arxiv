    "in general , the probability of coherent emission decreases at shorter wavelengths , which is often not sufficiently reduced for optical wavelengths , and imaging with transition radiation in the euv region might be an option  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the knowledge and control of the spectra , the imaging with euv radiation also requires dedicated detectors and optics , and a complete set - up in vacuum to prevent strong absorption in air .",
    "the luminescence of scintillation screens  @xcite , which is a stochastic process , is inherently linear in the number of interacting electrons ( neglecting quenching and saturation effects ) , hence coherent radiation effects are not expected in pure scintillation light .",
    "however , transition radiation is also emitted at the boundary of vacuum and scintillator , and coherent optical radiation can still appear [ see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : indi_3_b ] ] .",

    "however , just as for spectral separation , this method also requires good knowledge and control of the form factor , and dedicated imaging geometries .",
    "in addition , the resolution depends on the observation angle of the scintillation screen ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which has to be taken into account in the layout of the imaging system . we note that an experiment on the spatial separation technique is currently being commissioned at flash .",
    "the fundamentally different light generation processes of scintillators and optical transition radiators result in clearly distinct temporal responses .",

    "accordingly , the temporal profiles of the otr pulses resemble the longitudinal electron beam profiles , whereas the temporal scintillation light pulses are fully dominated by the decay of the excited states in the scintillator .",

    "in contrast to spectral and spatial separation , the temporal separation technique provides a definite method to suppress coherent optical transition radiation without further relying on the wavelength - dependent longitudinal form factor .",
    "in addition , this technique inherently includes the suppression of secondary incoherent radiation sources such as synchrotron radiation generated from magnets directly upstream of the imaging screen or backward otr emitted from the second imaging screen boundary , whereas spectral components in the uv region or at shorter wavelengths may excite the scintillator , affecting the temporal separation . as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , potential synchrotron radiation sources can be identified and thus separated by adjusting the upstream magnets . furthermore , the coherent emission of otr at the second scintillator screen boundary is mitigated due to multiple scattering in the scintillator material as is described and demonstrated in refs .",
