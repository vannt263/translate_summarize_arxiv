    "schematically , one has the following picture : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 are the scaling dimensions of the uv operator in the banks - zaks ( bz ) sector @xcite , the unparticle operator @xmath17 , and the sm operator of a type @xmath22 , @xmath23 . triggered by this intriguing suggestion , a lot of phenomenological analysis",
