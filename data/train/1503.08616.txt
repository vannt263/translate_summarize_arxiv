    "the study of the physics of brittle fracture has been very fruitful in the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "new experiments have shown various new features of dynamic fracture , focused in mode - i ( tensile ) fracture using amorphous brittle materials  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experiments have shown a sharp transition between the regime of steady - state cracks and the regime of unstable cracks  @xcite . in steady state , where the driving displacement , @xmath2 ( of order @xmath3 , the griffith criterion ) , is sufficiently small , a single crack propagates in the midline of the sample , reaching a steady - state velocity ( which is of order the rayleigh surface wave speed , @xmath4 ) .",
    "increasing @xmath2 results in an increased steady - state velocity , yielding a @xmath5 curve , until a specific critical point . increasing the diving displacement further , beyond this critical point , we enter the unstable regime , where small microbranches start to appear nearby the main crack .",
    "the experiments have shown that above the critical point , the size of the average microbranch ( which is log - normal distributed ) increases rapidly with the crack velocity , measured via the slope of the electrical resistance of a conductive layer that is pasted on the sample .",
    "the electrical resistance slope exhibits oscillations whose amplitude increases rapidly as well .",
    "increasing the driving displacement furthermore , the small microbranches become large microbranches , creating a complex fracture pattern , and finally , creates macrobranches  @xcite .",
    "some of the new experimental findings could not be explained via the classical theoretical approach for fracture mechanics , the linear elasticity fracture mechanics ( lefm ) theory  @xcite .",
    "for example , several predictions of lefm for the critical velocity , such as the studies of yoffe  @xcite or eshelby  @xcite predicted a single universal critical velocity much higher than that seen in some of the experimental studies , such as in pmma  @xcite .",
    "also , experiments have found various material - dependent features such as the terminal velocity which the crack manages to propagate as well as the critical velocity for macro - branches  @xcite .",
    "as far as the micro - branching critical velocity , the question of universality is debatable  @xcite , but anyhow , the velocities are much smaller that the theoretical predictions . for a review , see the introduction in  @xcite .",
    "however , the basic reason for the failures of lefm is that the basic equations of lefm yield a singularity of the stresses near the crack tip  @xcite , and thus , the zone nearest to the crack s tip ( the process zone ) can not be modeled via lefm .",
    "the failure of lefm , caused by this singularity , gave rise to an interest in discrete lattice models and simulations  @xcite .",
    "in this kind of model , the basic length - scale which is the lattice scale , prevents the singularities that appear in the continuum approach .",
    "the lattice models were successful in reproducing the behavior of steady - state cracks  @xcite , including a material dependency of the @xmath5 curves , in that it depends on the specific parameters of the inter - atomic potential  @xcite . moreover , the lattice models predict a certain critical point beyond which the steady - state solution becomes linearly unstable  @xcite . in the simulations , this is exactly the point which the crack stops propagating along the midline of the sample and some additional bonds , not along the midline , start to break  @xcite .",
    "however , especially in mode - i pure lattice simulations , the post - instability behavior of the lattice models do not match the experiments , neither qualitatively or quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "one recent approach to overcome these difficulties has been to turn to a more realistic model for an amorphous material , the continuous random network ( crn ) model  @xcite .",
    "the continuous random network was suggested first by zachariasen for describing amorphous material  @xcite , and specific effective algorithms ( using monte - carlo techniques ) for generating the crn were offered in  @xcite .",
    "recent accurate 2d experiments using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) in 2d silica on the structure of this amorphous material were reproduced to excellent accuracy using the zachariasen model  @xcite . after generating an amorphous crn sample ,",
    "molecular dynamics simulations were found to yield many of the important qualitative features of mode - i fracture experiments in amorphous brittle materials  @xcite .",
    "the simulations showed the birth of microbranches growing nearby the main crack , the increase of the size of the microbranches as a function of the driving displacement ( or of course , the crack velocity ) , and the growth of the amplitude of the derivative of the electrical resistance with respect to the time as a function of the crack velocity .",
    "another direction recently examined was that of perturbed lattice models  @xcite , which exhibited behavior similar to that of the crn model , including the main features mentioned above .",
    "however , these simulations ( both the crn and the perturbed lattice simulations ) suffered from a significant level of numerical noise , since each microbranch contained only a few tens of broken bonds at most .",
    "thus , the statistics that concerns the most interesting physics , that of the branches , was quite poor .",
    "these intriguing results , performed on limited size systems ( @xmath6 atoms ) provide strong motivation to conduct larger simulations both to reduce the overall noise level and to get closer to at least a mesoscopic system where scaling behavior might set in . the goal was to achieve at least a two magnitude increase in size , i.e. , simulations of the order of millions of atoms ( @xmath7 atoms ) , which necessitated using parallel ( multi - threading ) computing . in this work",
    "we study mode - i fracture via large scale simulations , with a particular focus on the properties of the microbranches that could not be studied in the previous , limited size , studies .",
    "in addition , recently experiments have been performed with gels , whose three orders of magnitude slower sound speed ( compared to the classic brittle materials like pmma or glass ) enables direct visualization by means of moderately fast video cameras , resulting in clear snapshots of the crack tip  @xcite . using the larger scale simulations we can now compare the crack s tip shape , both on steady - state cracks in a strip geometry , and especially , near the origin of the microbranching instability .",

    "[ validity ] we perform some basic checks of our models , confirming that the transverse size of the microbranch zone ( @xmath8 ) decreases with increasing sample width @xmath9 , for a given scaled driving displacement @xmath10 ( in the experiments , using macroscopic sample sizes , the microbranching region width is much smaller than the sample width and the dynamics of the fracture is not effected by the sample edges ) . next , in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present the quantitative results concerning the birth and the growth of the microbranches , and their physical features .",

    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the simulations presented in this study are divided generally into two kinds .",
    "the first one uses the continuous random network ( crn ) model ( to model an amorphous material ) , and the second employs a perturbed ( honeycomb or hexagonal ) lattice model .",
    "both models were described in depth in  @xcite and  @xcite respectively .",
    "we will review them here shortly .",
    "the crn model reproduces various structural features of real brittle amorphous materials ( though 2d , in this study ) such as amorphous silicon or silica  @xcite , and a 3d - extension of this model should reproduce the real behavior of fracture .",
    "the perturbed honeycomb lattice is the ordered phase of the crn , as discussed at length in  @xcite and shares similar features and results ( though with less noise ) .",
    "in addition , in  @xcite there is clear experimental 2d evidence that 2d ordered materials share the structural features of the perturbed honeycomb lattice . also , the perturbed hexagonal lattice is a generalization of the hexagonal lattice that was used in many studies to study dynamic fracture ( for example  @xcite ) , and facilitates comparison with this body of work .",
    "we generated two - dimensional crn s by a 2d - analogue  @xcite of the www algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the potential that was used in the construction of the crn included both a 2-body central force and a 3-body bond - bending force :  @xcite : @xmath11 , \\label{potential}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the radial distance between each pair of nearest - neighbor atoms and @xmath13 is a constant lattice scale ( in contrast to the perturbed lattice model ) . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radial and the azimuthal ( 3-body ) spring constants , respectively .",

    "( characterizing a honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "we start from a pure honeycomb lattice , randomize large number of bonds and perform a monte - carlo procedure , wherein each cycle we switch two bonds , calculating the optimal positions of the atoms in the near zone of the switched bonds to determine the change of energy so as to decide whether to accept the switch .",
    "finally , we get a crn that looks like zachariasen s patterns  @xcite and the tem snapshots of the 2d amorphous silica  @xcite . for a in - depth discussion ,",
    "see  @xcite .      here",
    "we start with a perfect honeycomb lattice and randomize the lattice scale of each  bond \" , @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] , and @xmath24 is constant for a given lattice , and in this work ranges between @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 refers to the nearest - neighbors of site @xmath18 . for a detailed discussion ,",
    "see  @xcite .      in our model , between each two atoms",
    "there is a piece - wise linear radial force ( 2-body force law ) of the form : @xmath28 where : @xmath29 the heaviside step function @xmath30 guarantees that the force drops immediately to zero when the distance between two atoms @xmath31 reaches a certain value @xmath32 ( the breaking of a  bond \" ) . in this work",
    "we set @xmath33 .",
    "we describe here brittle materials with an extreme sharp transition from linear response to failure , though , in reality the failure is always somewhat smoother .",
    "thus , alternatively to eq .",
    "[ linear ] , we can use a smoother force law , which instead of a sharp failure at @xmath34 , has a more realistic smooth transition wherein the force law drops to zero of the form  @xcite : @xmath35}{1+\\tanh ( \\alpha_{\\mathrm{pot } } ) } \\label{nonlinear}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the smoothness parameter , such that when @xmath37 the force law reverts to the piecewise linear force law .",
    "the effect of @xmath36 on the fracture feature was investigated previously  @xcite , and is reproduced in this paper .",
    "the results in this paper refer to the piecewise linear model , unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "in addition there is a 3-body force law that depends on the cosine of each of the angles , acts on the central atom ( atom @xmath18 ) of each angle , and may be expressed as : @xmath38k'_{i , j}k'_{i , k } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the force that is applied on the other two atoms ( atoms @xmath39 ) may expressed as : @xmath40k'_{i , j}k'_{i , k } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course , the forces satisfy the relation : @xmath41 .",
    "the 3-body force law drops immediately to zero when using a piecewise linear force law when the bond breaks ( eq . [ linear ] ) , or may be taken to vanish smoothly , using eq .",
    "[ nonlinear ] . in a honeycomb lattice",
    "there are three angles associated with each atom and in the hexagonal lattice there are six of them ( we note that in the hexagonal lattice this choice is a little bit arbitrary since there are in general additional optional angles for each atom ) . there is a certain preferred angle @xmath42 for which the 3-body force law vanishes ( in the honeycomb lattice we set @xmath20 and in the hexagonal lattice we set @xmath43 ) .    in addition , it is convenient to add a small kelvin - type viscoelastic force proportional to the relative velocity between the two atoms of the bond @xmath44  @xcite : @xmath45 with @xmath46 the viscosity parameter .",
    "the viscous force also vanishes after the bond is broken , governed by @xmath47 .",
    "the imposition of a small amount of such a viscosity acts to stabilize the system and is especially useful in the relatively narrow systems simulated herein .",
    "the set of equations of motion of each atom is then : @xmath48 in this work the units are chosen so that the radial spring constant @xmath14 and the atoms mass @xmath49 is unity .",
    "we note that numerical measurement of the young s modulus of the hexagonal lattices for @xmath50 yields the well - known analytical expression @xmath51 and is twice as big ( @xmath52 ) with @xmath53 and the poisson s ratio is @xmath54 as reported in many previous works  @xcite . in the honeycomb lattice and the crn",
    "( with @xmath55 ) , the young s modulus is approximately @xmath56 while the poisson s ratio remains similar . however , the value of @xmath14 is not crucial ( in this study ) , since the results in this paper are in normalized units ( @xmath10 , @xmath57 ) .    after relaxing the initial lattice ,",
    "we strain the lattice under a mode - i tensile loading with a given constant strain corresponding a given driving displacement @xmath58 of the edges ( the top and bottom rows are held tight and do not allow transverse displacement ) and seed the system with an initial crack ( the left boundary condition is also held in a pure  cracked \" state ) .",
    "the crack then propagates via the same molecular dynamics euler scheme using eqs .",
    "[ force_radial]-[motion_equations ] .",
    "we note that the calculation of @xmath3 is set under the equality of the energy in the uncracked uniform strain , to the energy needed for breaking the midline bonds in the sample ( for example , see  @xcite for the case of square lattice ) .",
    "we parameterize our results in this paper using the normalized quantity @xmath10 , but of course @xmath59 ( the stress intensity factor normalized to the griffith value )  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the major innovation of this work , compared to our previous studies , is the use of large scale simulations .",
    "the previous studies of the amorphous ( crn ) model  @xcite and the perturbed lattice model  @xcite used approximately @xmath60 particles . in this study we wished to use approximately @xmath61 particles . these kind of simulations can not reasonably be performed by a singe cpu , and thus force us to use multi - thread computing .",
    "we choose to use gpu computing , parallelizing the code via cuda  @xcite .",
    "this kind of programing forces the programmer to use the different levels of memory carefully  @xcite , which makes possible achieving an acceleration up to @xmath62 faster than a regular @xmath63 code using a single cpu . beside the benefit of getting the results in a given system",
    "much faster , the main benefit is the possibility to run large scale simulations , which was prohibitive before .",
    "this tool makes possible the simulation of millions of atoms in reasonable simulation times .",
    "our model consists of several modules , each one of which needs to be re - written in cuda .",
    "both amorphous and lattice models use a molecular - dynamics module for the fracture simulations that must be parallelized . in addition , for the crn , the metropolis monte - carlo algorithm for generating the crn needs to be parallelized .",
    "furthermore , the electrical resistance simulations , which we use to determine the crack velocity  @xcite , is solved by a nonlinear laplace solver that needs to be parallelized too .",
    "the electrical resistance is calculated via the method that was used in  @xcite , by solving the nonlinear laplace on a grid of resistors ( each broken bond , in the main crack and in the microbranches is taken into account )  @xcite . in appendix [ appendix_a ]",
    "we discuss about the implementation of the different modules , the parameters that were used and the degree of acceleration achieved for the different modules with the gpu using cuda .",
    "the various sized lattices we use contain :    * @xmath64 ( @xmath65 in the slepyan model notation ) atoms for the honeycomb lattice and @xmath66 atoms for the hexagonal lattice , which we call @xmath67 ( factor=1 ) .",

    "[ pattarns2](b ) we can see clearly the curved power - law shape of the microbranches ( for a quantitative discussion , see sec .",

    "this effect in seen clearly in the perturbed honeycomb lattice and in the crn lattice , and in a more moderate way in the hexagonal perturbed lattice .",
    "this result is crucial ; if the lattice models are physical , then when increasing the lattice size , the relative fracture zone must decrease , so that the branching does not remain macroscopic in the @xmath88 limit , which would conflict with the experimental results ) .",
    "it can be seen that the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath2 is more or less linear .",
    "this may be related to the linear increase of the size of the average microbranch as a function of the driving displacement ( for example , see fig .",
    "[ hex_res](b))below ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the new experiments using gels yield clear snapshots of the crack tip  @xcite .",
    "larger scale simulation enable us to compare the crack tip shape to the experimental snapshots in both steady - state cracks and near the origin of instability .",
    "first , we present the very good agreement between experiment and simulations of the crack s tip shape in steady - state cracks in the finite - width strip geometry in fig [ tadpole ] . in the upper picture ,",
    "when the crack length is small comparing to the sample s width , the crack has the ( well - known ) parabolic shape ; no blunting can be seen and lefm works perfectly ( except for nonlinear effects in the extreme crack tip zone  @xcite ) .",
    "as the crack length grows , the finite width of the strip affects the crack s tip shape , generating a  tadpole - like \" shape .",
    "we set a careful lattice simulations in finite width strip using different values of @xmath10 .",
    "since the simulations have only a finite number of atoms , the results are scaled to the real size of the experimental sample .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ tadpole ] the excellent match of the crack s tip shape between pure lattice simulations ( described in detail below ) and the experiments . this ",
    "tadpole \" shape is generic for finite - size ( strip ) lattice simulations , both honeycomb or hexagonal , with any amount of viscosity . since the experimental crack is not exactly symmetric between the upper and the lower size of the crack , we used several values of @xmath10 to get an optimal match between experiment and simulation ( the small @xmath10 shape is somewhat better on the upper side and the large @xmath10 shape is somewhat better in the lower side ) .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite there are snapshots of the crack tip shape near the origin of the microbranching instability ( on the right in fig .",
    "[ origin_micro ] ) . in order to reproduce this crack tip shape ( in addition to using the large scale simulation )",
    ", we set @xmath89 ( only for this part in the paper ) , to magnify the crack tip radius compared to the lattice scale @xmath84 .",
    "this enables us to meaningfully compare the simulation results to experiments ( this value of @xmath90 is a bit extreme , but qualitatively , the same physical effect can be seen using smaller value of @xmath90 ) .",
    "the lattice simulations are presented on the left in fig .",
    "[ origin_micro ] ) .",
    "we can see that there is a close resemblance between the two series s of snapshots . at first",
    ", the crack travels in the midline of the sample , yielding the parabolic crack s tip shape of lefm . when a new microbranch is born , the crack tip bifurcates to two , while very rapidly one  wins \" and continues to propagate , and the other  dies \" .",
    "the branch that continues to propagate has a small deformed shape comparing to the original shape before it continue to propagate ( the crack shape here significantly differs from the lefm prediction ) .",
    "all of these features are reproduced in the lattice simulations .",
    "it is important to mention that both experiments and simulations reveal that the origin of microbranching in mode - i fracture always lies in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip itself , rather than far behind the main crack .      in this section",
    "we present the quantitative results for various features of the fracture patterns , especially the microbranches .",
    "first , we present the @xmath5 curve , the total amount of broken bonds in the microbranches , measured for a crack that reached the end of the strip , as a function of the crack velocity and the rms of @xmath91 , the rate of increase of the derivative of the electrical resistance with respect to time as a function of the crack velocity .",

    "the results for the perturbed honeycomb lattice is presented in fig .",
    "[ hon_res ] , and for the crn in fig .",
    "[ crn_res ] .",
    "we can clearly see that in all three models the slope of the @xmath5 appears to saturate in the high velocity regime for the larger system sizes .",
    "this saturation is known from previous lattice studies  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the curves are similar to the experimental @xmath5 curves of real amorphous materials  @xcite",
    ". a close look at the curves of the total amount of broken bonds in the microbranches ( which is our proxy for the average length of a microbranch as measured experimentally , which we use to reduce the statistical noise ) as a function of the crack velocity , using both the honeycomb perturbed lattice and the crn , reveals quantitatively what we have seen qualitatively using small system sizes . due to the noisiness of using finite size lattices , rather than two different regimes , with a single steady state crack at small velocities , and a sharp increase in the length of a microbranch in the large velocity regime",
    ", we get a smooth exponential behavior .",
    "however , the exponent of the curves increases robustly with the lattice size , sharpening the difference between the steady state regime and the the microbranching ( large velocity ) regime .",
    "in addition we can see that in general , the crn results act like a very perturbed honeycomb lattice , i.e. , in any given @xmath10 , the number of broken bonds is larger in the crn than in the perturbed honeycomb lattice , similar to what we saw in ref .",
    "in addition , using the honeycomb perturbed lattice we can see the increase of the rms amplitude of the derivative of the electrical resistance with respect to the time as a function of the crack velocity . at high velocities ,",
    "the rms amplitude is approximately three times greater than the amplitude in low crack velocities , in agreement with the experiments regarding the rms of the crack velocity ( fig .",
    "11(c ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "looking at the results for the perturbed hexagonal lattice , we get one of the most important results of this paper . in fig .",
    "[ hex_res](b ) , we present the normalized number of microbranches broken bonds ( per number of bonds in the entire system ) as a function of the crack velocity . the different curves ( using various lattice size ) are similar to each other , however , enlarging the lattice size , the transition become sharper with @xmath92 .",
    "using @xmath93 , we can see two different separate regimes ( one of steady - state cracks , and one for microbranching ) , that looks very much like the transition of the average microbranch length in the experiments ( fig .",
    "11(a ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "this result verifies the main assumption of the lattice models .",
    "the physical phenomena of microbranching is qualitatively described by lattice models and simulations , when enlarging the system size , the results become more quantitatively similar to the ( macroscopic ) experimental results .",
    "nevertheless , quantitatively , the critical velocity that was found in the experiments was less than the critical velocities that were seen in our simulations .",
    "however , in previous studies it was shown that in the lattice models , we can control the critical velocity using different values of @xmath36  @xcite . here",
    "we check that this is still valid when using a 3-body force - law and a perturbed lattice . in fig . [ nonlinear_fig](a ) , for the case @xmath67 , we present the total amount of microbranches using the perturbed honeycomb lattice .",
    "we can see that first , @xmath94 reproduces the piecewise linear results , as expected .",
    "second , smaller values of @xmath36 yields a much larger quantity of broken bonds for a given @xmath2 , indicating a much lower critical velocity ( because of the noise in this lattice we can not realize the zero microbranch regime ) .",
    "in addition we check whether using larger - scale lattices ( @xmath93 ) yields the same fracture patterns . in fig .",
    "[ nonlinear_fig](b ) we can see that fracture patterns remain similar using the smaller value of @xmath36 ( here we used the perturbed hexagonal lattice ) , though for a given @xmath2 the microbranches are larger , as expected",
    ".      having larger systems enables , for the first time , the generation of enough statistics to examine important quantitative features of the microbranches that have been measured experimentally  @xcite . since in this study , we obviously are restricted to 2d features only , we focused here on the branching angle of the microbranches , and on the power - law shape of the microbranches .",

    "the other models do not show the decrease in @xmath107 for the longest branches that is apparent for the hexagonal case , and perhaps data for longer microbranches are needed in the other cases , but in any case the asymptotic value of the exponent in all cases is less than unity .",
    "we have used relatively large lattices fracture simulations using gpu parallel computing ( with @xmath108 particles ) for studying mode - i fracture .",
    "we find that the basic results from small lattices ( @xmath109 particles ) are confirmed using the larger size systems .",
    "the fracture patterns look more physical with a larger system , due to the large number of broken bonds in each microbranch . the width of the microbranch region relative to the system width decreases , a necessary condition if these models are to be taken seriously .",
    "the basic properties of the microbranches , like the total length of the microbranches and the oscillations of the derivative of the electrical resistance with respect to the time based velocity measurements , which were extremely noisy when using small lattices , look more smooth and realistic in the larger lattices .",
    "in particular there is now a clearer transition between the regime of steady state cracks , which there is a negligible amount of broken bonds beside the main crack , and the regime of instability , where the amount of broken bonds in the microbranches increases dramatically .",
    "the sharp transition is particularly clear in the hexagonal perturbed lattice ( fig .",
    "[ hex_res](b ) ) .",
    "in addition , important features of the microbranches that have been found and studied experimentally , are recovered in our large system simulations",
    ". the correct branching angle is found , and in the crn lattice the correct variance is also obtained .",
    "the universal power - law shape that was found in different experimental studies  @xcite is recovered here , and for the larger branches , we get the correct power in the hexagonal perturbed lattice .    in future work , we plan to exploit the power of gpu parallel computing to run 3d simulations using @xmath108 particles , with the goal of studying the different aspects concerning the 3d nature of the microbranches .",
    "we intend to check the similarities and the differences between 2d and 3d mode - i fracture simulations , and to find the regime when the 2d model is sufficient , and on the other hand , the regime where 3d simulations are crucial .",
    "in this appendix we discuss implementation of our codes using cuda and the run - times of the cuda runs using nvidia s tesla c2050/c2070 gpu for the different modules that were used in this study , and the acceleration ratios between a single cpu run and the gpu run .",
    "we re - wrote our @xmath63 codes and replaced the main time - demanding functions by cuda kernels  @xcite .",
    "cuda is a computer code language that was developed by nvidia for using its cpu s .",
    "we note that in principle , one could use opencl , a general language for any gpu device , though cuda is optimized for nvidia s graphic cards .    for using gpu computing optimally ,",
    "the code should be written as a function of the particular hardware .",
    "naively , the computational tasks are divided into several blocks , each block containing a specific number of threads , when the threads in the same block execute simultaneously . in this work we used 512 threads per block which is the maximal number of threads per block available on our graphic card .",
    "the parameters of the physical problem are loaded to the _ global memory _ of the gpu and each thread computes one computational task , such as the force of one spring that acts on a pair of atoms .",
    "such a naive choice however only produces up to a 10 times acceleration , since there are a lot of calls to the global memory ( which is relatively slow ) for each atom calculating the force , especially in the 3-body force - law .",
    "thus we extensively employed the option of using _ shared memory _ ( which is as fast as cache memory , shared for all the threads in the same block and limited to 64k ) to further accelerate the simulations , especially in the molecular - dynamics module  @xcite .",
    "the global memory of tesla c2050/c2070 gpu is about 2.5 gbytes , which is the limiting factor of the number of atoms in the simulation . in this work",
    "we used double precision accuracy for all of our calculations ( so using float precision will increase the number of atoms by a factor of 2 , which is not significant ; the main issue of this study is the effect of increasing the number of atoms by two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "the underlying plan of the main , molecular dynamics , module using shared memory is to split the ( potentially random , and thus general ) grid of atoms to several physical zones ( very much like open - mpi as opposed to openmp parallelization ) with lists that connect between the zones applied as a boundary condition for each physical zone ; for the central elastic force law ( and also for the viscoelastic force law ) we sort the bonds and for the 3-body force law we sort the atoms .",
    "each zone (  block \" in the cuda - jargon ) loads the locations and the velocities to a fast shared memory , and each  thread \" calculates the force of a certain bond ( for the central force law ) , or atom ( for the 3-body force law ) .",
    "thus , instead of several calls to the global memory for each atom s location , the calls are for the fast shared memory , and so good efficiency is then achieved .",
    "since the threads in the same block execute simultaneously , we have to use cuda _ atomic _ commands to sum correctly the contribution of the forces acts from the neighboring atoms .",
    "then , the new velocities and locations are calculated by simple cuda kernels .",
    "the electrical resistance module is basically solving a nonlinear laplace equation .",
    "we used the methodology that was introduced in  @xcite for calculating the electrical resistance ( a constant grid of bonds with @xmath110 ) , while a cracked bond in the molecular - dynamics module determines the  cracked \" ( @xmath111 ) bonds in the constant grid of the electrical resistance .",
    "thus , we used the same well - known methodology of using the cuda kernels for solving 2d diffusion equations  @xcite , including the use of shared memory .",
    "we implemented both jacobi and red - black gauss - seidel methods of solution , but no significant difference ( in terms of the number of iterations for convergence ) was found between the methods . in fig .",
    "[ resis_demo ] we can see an example of the derivative of the electrical resistance with respect to the time using a perturbed honeycomb lattice for a specific @xmath87 . we can see that using different size lattices ( using the new gpu code in the larger lattices and the cpu code in the smaller lattice ) , we can see that the shape of the curves of electrical resistance look very much alike the experimental rms amplitude of the crack velocity  @xcite ( that is measured via the electrical resistance  @xcite ) .    the parallel monte - carlo algorithm module for generating the crn required extra care .",
    "since each possible switch of bonds should be considered energetically independently , each switch should be separate from all the other simultaneous possible switches ( to avoid over - lapping of the switches and their neighboring zone ) .",
    "we mention that we use the parallel _ thrust _ library ( in cuda ) for sorting efficiently the nearest bonds for each bond , every given number of cycles .    in figs .",
    "[ times_md]-[times_lap](a ) we can see the typical run times for 1000 cycles ( in seconds ) for the molecular dynamics module and the laplace solver module as a function of the system size .",
    "we can clearly see the benefit of using gpu computing , while the main benefit is the possibility to run systems with large number of atoms , which with a single cpu , was prohibitively time - consuming .",
    "the run - time using @xmath0 atoms with a single cpu is similar to the run - time using @xmath1 atoms with a single gpu . in figs .",
    "[ times_md]-[times_lap](b ) we see the acceleration ratios between a single cpu and a single gpu ( of course , only for small systems , when a cpu run is available ) .",
    "we can see the significant acceleration , 40 times faster for the honeycomb lattice and over 50 times faster for a hexagonal lattice due to more demanding 3-body force law ) . in the laplace solver",
    "the speedup is a little bit lower and stands at approximately 25 times faster in gpu versus a single cpu .    in fig .",
    "[ times_mc ] we can see the run - times using a single cpu and the gpu .",
    "we can see here that the acceleration ratio here is lower then in the previous modules ( about @xmath112 ) , but still , in larger lattices ( of @xmath1 atoms ) , the benefit is clear .",
    "we mention that since the programing using cuda is much more demanding from the programmer , especially regarding the memory management , while re - programing the code , we improved our old - cpu code ( that was in use in  @xcite ) , significantly ; the acceleration ratio of the gpu code to the old cpu code is @xmath113 .",
    "in previous work  @xcite we have shown that the crn shares similar features with real amorphous matter , like amorphous silicon  @xcite . in this appendix",
    "we check explicitly the quality of the parallel gpu algorithm , generating a crn . in fig .",
    "[ crn_histograms ] we can see the radial and angular distributions of the bonds in the crn using different lattice size , and in fig . [ rdf ] we can see the radial distribution function @xmath114 using different lattice size .",
    "@xmath67 ( of @xmath0 atoms ) is the data using the old cpu code that was in use in  @xcite , when larger lattices was produced via the new gpu algorithm .",
    "we can see that the radial and angular distributions and the @xmath114 curves are similar under the scaling of the lattice size ( the number of the bonds or angles ) .",
    "this proves the validity of the parallel gpu algorithm , comparing the old cpu algorithm ( that was verified before against experiments ) .",
    "moreover , the rdf in the larger lattice size is smoother due to better statistics .",
    "since the models in this paper use a 3-body potential law ( aside by the central two - body force law ) with @xmath116 , we need to recalculate the rayleigh wave speed @xmath4 , which is the terminal velocity for mode - i fracture  @xcite for different @xmath117 . the most convenient way to calculate the rayleigh wave speed is to calculate first the longitude ( primary ) @xmath118 and the transverse ( secondary ) @xmath119 wave speeds and then , to calculate the rayleigh wave speed via the well - known formula  @xcite : @xmath120 for @xmath50 the expressions for @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and thus also for @xmath4 , can be derived analytically for a 2d hexagonal lattice with @xmath121 as the lattice scale ( for @xmath122 ; the wave velocities scales as @xmath123 ) : @xmath124 and for a 2d honeycomb lattice : @xmath125    we calculate @xmath118 and @xmath119 via measuring the wave velocities by initiating longitude and transverse small deformations in the end of the samples in the different lattices that we use in this study and then find @xmath4 via eq .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ sounds](a ) for the hexagonal lattice and in fig .",
    "[ sounds](b ) for the honeycomb and crn lattices .",
    "we can see that for both lattices , the numerical value for the wave velocities using @xmath50 reproduce the analytical values , eqs .",
    "[ wave_hex ] and [ wave_hon ] , respectively . in the hexagonal lattice",
    "using @xmath53 ( which was the value used in this study ) the rayleigh wave speed increases by @xmath126 relative to the @xmath50 value . in the honeycomb lattice , where we use @xmath55 at most , the rayleigh wave speed increases by @xmath127 relative to the @xmath50 value .",
    "we note the crn speeds ( in the ellipse in fig .",
    "[ sounds](b ) ) are a little bit slower than the pure honeycomb lattice .",
    "in addition we note that the random noise of the perturbed lattice changes the wave speeds less than @xmath128 , and that the wave speeds are not affected at all by @xmath36 .",
