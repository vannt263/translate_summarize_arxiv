    "collisionless shocks are important phenomena in the universe ; they heat and compress interstellar or intergalactic plasmas and often accelerate charged particles or cosmic rays .",
    "the dissipation mechanism of the collisionless shocks is highly complex and generally involved with instabilities in the collisionless plasma .",
    "the weibel instability is driven in anisotropic or counter - streaming collisionless plasmas @xcite and generates strong magnetic fields .",
    "collisionless shocks inevitably generate an anisotropy within their transition region , where the upstream and downstream plasmas are mixed up , therefore , the weibel instability can develop and generate strong magnetic fields there if the background magnetic field is weak .",
    "@xcite considered such a process in non - relativistic collisionless shocks and @xcite discussed the magnetic field generation by the weibel instability in relativistic collisionless shocks of gamma - ray bursts .    in this context , the weibel instability in relativistic counter - streaming plasmas has been investigated extensively by means of particle - in - cell simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recent research with simulations showed that the `` weibel - mediated '' collisionless shocks can form at relativistic propagation speed in electron - positron plasmas @xcite and also in electron - ion plasmas @xcite without background magnetic field ; in these shocks the dissipation mechanism is effectively provided by the magnetic fields generated by the weibel - type instability in the shock transition region . in the universe , these shocks can be driven associated with relativistic phenomena , such as gamma - ray bursts , jets from active galactic nuclei , or pulsar winds .",
    "there is also a possibility that these weibel - mediated shocks are driven even in non - relativistic phenomena , e.g. , shocks of supernova remnants whose propagation speed is typically @xmath2 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , in this case , the weibel instability can be inefficient because the linear growth rate of the instability is proportional to the flow velocity @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , it is not clear yet whether this kind of shocks can exist in non - relativistic regime . in this paper , however , we show that the weibel - mediated collisionless shocks propagating at non - relativistic speed can form in unmagnetized electron - ion plasmas by performing numerical simulations .",
    "this also suggests a possibility to proof the formation of these shocks in laboratory plasmas with large - scale laser facilities .",
    "in order to investigate the collisionless shocks in electron - ion plasmas without background magnetic fields , we performed numerical simulations . the simulation code is a relativistic and electromagnetic particle - in - cell code with two spatial and three velocity dimensions ( 2d3v ) which was developed based on a standard method described by @xcite .",
    "the basic equations are the maxwell s equations and the ( relativistic ) equation of motion of particles .",
    "the simulation plane is the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the @xmath6 axis is perpendicular to the plane .",
    "since we consider collisionless shocks in unmagnetized plasmas , the electromagnetic fields are initially set to zero over the entire simulation box .",
    "the boundary condition of the electromagnetic field is periodic to each direction .    in the simulations",
    "a collisionless shock is driven by means of the `` injection method . ''",
    "there are two rigid walls at the left - hand side ( smaller @xmath7 ) and right - hand side ( larger @xmath7 ) of the simulation box and these walls reflect particles specularly .",
    "initially , both electrons and ions are uniformly loaded in the region between the two walls at the bulk flow velocity of @xmath4 in the @xmath8-direction . at the early stage of the simulations , the particles located near the right wall",
    "were reflected by the wall and then interacted with the incoming particles , i.e. , the upstream plasma , via some instabilities .",
    "such instabilities induce strong electric or magnetic fields that provide dissipation mechanism of the shock and , eventually , a collisionless shock is formed .",
    "note that the frame of the simulation corresponds to the downstream rest frame .",
    "we have carried out a series of simulations with upstream bulk velocities of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the speed of light .",
    "the thermal velocity of electrons is typically taken as one - tenth of the bulk velocity and that of ions is determined so that the temperatures of electrons and ions are same .",
    "because of the computational power , we used a reduced ion mass of @xmath13 . here , we take @xmath14 as the unit of time and the electron skin depth @xmath15 as the unit of length , where @xmath16 is the electron plasma frequency defined for the electron number density of the upstream plasma , @xmath17 .",
    "we also define the ion inertial length , @xmath18 .",

    "[ fig : npv045 ] .",
    "the color shows the number density normalized by the upstream value , namely , @xmath17 .",
    "the upstream plasma flows from the left to the right and goes through the transition region which has a filamentary structure and then reaches the almost uniform downstream state ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : npv045dev ] shows the time evolution of the number density of ions . the number density shown in color",
    "is averaged over the @xmath26-direction .",
    "the transition region , or `` shock front '' , which is visible as a steep increase in the number density , propagates upstream at an almost constant speed ( @xmath27 measured in the downstream frame ) after @xmath28 .",
    "note that the particles that are reflected at the right wall at the early stage of the simulation , which are remains of the initial condition , eventually fade away at later times .",
    "figure [ fig : profiles_v045 ] shows profiles of quantities averaged over the @xmath26-direction at @xmath24 : ( a ) the ion number density , ( b ) the mean velocity in the @xmath7-direction , and ( c ) the energy densities of electric and magnetic fields . both number density and",
    "mean velocity rapidly change to reach the downstream values through the transition region which extends with the width of @xmath29 .",
    "it is remarkable that a strong magnetic field is generated within the shock transition region .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field reaches approximately @xmath30 of the upstream bulk kinetic energy density ( measured in the downstream rest frame ) , @xmath31 .",
    "this strong magnetic field deflects and isotropize the particles coming from upstream ; this provides an effective dissipation mechanism for this collisionless shock .",
    "figure [ fig : jxbz_v045 ] shows the current density in the @xmath7-direction , @xmath32 , and the @xmath6-component of the magnetic field , @xmath33 , at @xmath24 .",
    "it is evident that a number of current filaments exist within the transition region .",
    "these filaments consist of ions which are surrounded by the diffuse electrons similar to the case of the relativistic counter - streaming plasmas @xcite .",
    "the filamentary structure seen in the number density in fig .",

    "these filaments generate the strong magnetic field around themselves which is also observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_v045 ] ( c ) .",
    "this structure would be formed through the weibel - type instability like the relativistic shocks in unmagnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "we also performed simulations with the bulk velocities of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in both cases we confirmed that the structure of the shock is qualitatively identical to that of @xmath20 case . the ion number density and",
    "the magnetic field obtained for @xmath34 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npbzv01 ] .",
    "it should be noted that these weibel - mediated shocks have similarities in the profiles of some quantities under changing the upstream bulk velocity @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : npvprofile ] shows the profiles as fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_v045 ] at different upstream bulk velocities : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here , the horizontal axes are the @xmath7-coordinate normalized by the ion inertial length including the relativistic effect , @xmath35 , where @xmath36^{-1/2}$ ] is the lorentz factor of the upstream bulk velocity .",
    "it is remarkable that the profiles in ( a ) and ( b ) are almost identical independent of @xmath4 . in particular , the widths of the shock transition region are @xmath37 in _ all _ cases .",
    "the energy densities of magnetic fields within the transition region also reach typically 1 - 2% of the upstream bulk kinetic energy density at maximum independent of @xmath4 .    in order to see the effect of the mass ratio",
    ", we performed simulations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath9 .",
    "the normalized ion number densities for the different three mass ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_profile ] as in fig .",
    "[ fig : npvprofile ] ( a ) .",
    "the width of the transition region is approximately @xmath37 in all cases and this suggests the width may be the same order even for the real mass ratio .",
    "however , there is a slight difference in the profiles and this will be investigated in detail in the forthcoming paper .",
    "the similarities in the normalized profiles shown in fig .  [ fig : npvprofile ] can be explained as follows .",
    "the structure of the transition region is essentially determined by the coalescence history of the ion current filaments . here , we simply approximate the coalescence of two filaments as that of two straight currents . in this approximation ,",
    "the current in each filament is proportional to the bulk velocity @xmath4 , and a dimensional analysis of the equation of motion of the filaments shows the time scale of the coalescence of two filaments due to the lorentz force , @xmath40 , is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , if we consider that the width in which the scale of the filamentary structure becomes twice is given by @xmath42 , it is independent of @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the downstream end of the transition region is determined by the saturation of the magnetic field of the ion current filaments ; i.e. , the typical gyro - radius of ions becomes comparable with the filament size , @xmath43 , like the case of electron - positron current filaments @xcite .",
    "this gives the condition @xmath44 , which is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , if we consider the initial scale of the ion current filaments is on the order of the electron skin depth @xmath45 , the total width of the transition region is also independent of @xmath4 .",
    "though the results described in the previous section were obtained for unmagnetized plasmas , these weibel - mediated shocks can also be driven in magnetized plasmas if the magnetic field is sufficiently weak .",
    "one of the criteria for neglecting the upstream background magnetic field , @xmath46 , may be given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the typical gyro - radius of ions defined for @xmath46 and @xmath49 is the typical width of the shock transition region .",
    "if we define the magnetization parameter @xmath50 as @xmath51 / [ n_{e0 } ( m_i + m_e ) v^2 /2]$ ] and use the result obtained in the previous section @xmath37 , the criterion can be rewritten @xmath52 . for shocks in supernova remnants ( snrs ) of @xmath53 years",
    "old , typical parameters are @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56 km s@xmath3 , and @xmath57 g . in this case , the magnetization parameter becomes @xmath58 and therefore there is a possibility that the weibel - mediated shocks are driven in snrs . for younger snrs with higher shock speeds of @xmath59 km s@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these shocks would be formed more easily .    if the weibel - mediated shocks are driven even at the velocity of @xmath53 km s@xmath3 , they can be investigated in laboratories because laser experiments are capable of generating collisionless plasma flow at this velocity @xcite . for this plasma flow with @xmath60 @xmath55 ( even at this density",
    ", the plasma can be collisionless during the shock formation ) , the width of the shock transition region is estimated to be @xmath61 mm .",
    "this is a reasonable value as the plasma size produced with the present - day large - scale laser facilities . to demonstrate the shock formation in laboratories is a challenging attempt but it would be particularly worthwhile as one of the key subjects for laboratory astrophysics ( e.g. , *",
