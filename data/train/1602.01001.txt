    "in particular , for the double - well potential ( dwp ) , which is dealt with in the present work , the gs wave function is spatially even , while the first excited state is odd .",

    "if the self - focusing nonlinearity is strong enough , it gives rise to the phase transition in the form of _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ ( ssb ) of the gs @xcite . in its simplest manifestation , which is provided by the dwp , the ssb implies that one well traps a larger atomic density or field power than the other .",
    "this effect also implies the breakup of the basic principle of quantum mechanics , according to which the gs can not be degenerate , as the ssb gives rise to a pair of two mutually symmetric gss in the dwp , with the maximum of the wave function found in either potential well ( as mentioned above , the jahn - teller effect gives rise to a qualitatively similar situation ) .",
    "the same dwp setting admits a symmetric state coexisting with the asymmetric ones , but , above the ssb point , the symmetric wave function no longer represents the gs , being unstable against symmetry - breaking perturbations .",
    "in the course of the spontaneous transition from the unstable symmetric state to a stable asymmetric one , the choice between the two mutually degenerate asymmetric states is determined by random perturbations , which push the system to build the maximum of the wave function in the left or right potential well .",

    "the symmetry breaking is the phase transition of the second kind ( alias the supercritical bifurcation , which does not admit hysteresis @xcite ) .",
    "further , gpe ( [ nlse ] ) was extended by adding an extra ( free ) spatial coordinate , which transforms the dwp into a two - dimensional dual - core structure @xcite .",
    "in such a setting , the self - attractive nonlinearity gives rise to matter - wave solitons , which self - trap in the free direction @xcite .",

    "the same type of the transition may be featured by cw ( continuous - wave ) states in dual - core systems with non - kerr nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "in addition to the analysis of static symmetric and asymmetric modes , dynamical regimes , most typically in the form of oscillations of the mean - field wave function between two wells of the dwp structure , were analyzed too .",
    "following the analogy with josephson oscillations of the wave function of cooper - paired electrons in superconducting tunnel junctions ustinov , the possibility of oscillations in _ bosonic josephson junctions _ was predicted @xcite .",
    "the simplest dynamical model of the josephson oscillations in bosonic systems was derived by means of the tight - binding approximation ( @xcite ) .",
    "experimental manifestations of the ssb have been observed in both bec and photonics .",
    "self - trapping of a macroscopically asymmetric state of the atomic condensate of @xmath9rb atoms , loaded into the dwp , as well as josephson oscillations in that setting , were reported in ref .",

    "in addition to usual bound states , one may work with quasi - localized modes in potentials which do not admit complete trapping in linear quantum mechanics , but give rise to leaky bound states , alias quasi - bound ones .",
    "the combination of such a potential and self - attractive nonlinearity makes it possible to transform the leaky states into truly bound ones carr1,carr2 .",
    "this possibility , in turn , suggests another setting , which is the subject of the present work : dwp structures embedded into a potential barrier . in the linear limit , this structure support solely symmetric leaky modes , that may be transformed into self - trapped ones with the help of the cubic self - attraction .",
    "the main feature of the system which , to the best of our knowledge , was not explored before , is competition between two different mean - field phase transitions of the second kind , driven by the nonlinearity : the ssb and transition to the self - trapping .",
    "realization of the competition in stationary states of the dwp system is the main subject of the present work .",
    "we demonstrate that , depending on parameters of the dwp structure and nonlinearity strength , either transition may happen first , with the growth of the nonlinearity .",
    "another essential problem addressed in the paper is a dynamical one , namely , josephson oscillations in the dwp structure , initiated by the instability of the symmetric mode , and collisions of free solitons with the structure .",
    "it is relevant to mention that , in terms of the bec realizations , the present setting represents macroscopic quantum states , with the phase transitions between them being quasi - classical ones , considered in the framework of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the validity of this approximation is usually justified by the large number of atoms in the condensate @xcite .",
    "the consideration of a few - body state in the dwp can give rise to quantum phase transitions , such as those in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model , which applies in this case @xcite .",
    "as suggested by a recent analysis of the three - dimensional many - body quantum gas with repulsive binary interactions , which is pulled to the center by a potential @xmath10 @xcite , the quantum phase transition may produce results similar to but different from their mean - field counterparts @xcite .",
    "in particular , the gs predicted by the mean - field may be replaced by a metastable state in the quantum many - body theory @xcite . in any case , the consideration of truly quantum phase transitions in the dwp structure is a subject for a separate work .",

    "the model is elaborated in section ii .",
    "results of the analysis of symmetric and spontaneously emerging asymmetric trapped and leaky modes in it are summarized in section iii .",
    "detailed results are obtained in a numerical form , and their basic features are explained by means of an analytical approach . both the trapped and leaky modes undergo the ssb transition with the increase of the norm , the symmetric modes getting unstable above the transition point .",

    "these are two control parameters which are subject to the variation in the subsequent analysis .",
    "for the same reason , the main findings are not sensitive to a particular shape of the dwp .",

    "while the former one makes it possible to find all relevant solutions independently of an input trial function , the latter method can be applied to obtain solution with high accuracy , provided that the initial guess is taken not too far from the final result . for the setting addressed in this paper ,",
    "the combination of both algorithms is the most efficient way of obtaining stationary solutions .",

    "the fact that the asymmetric modes , when they exists , have smaller values of @xmath76 for given @xmath25 , hence they realize the system s gs [ see figs .",

    "a noteworthy fact is that the system features the competition of the two different mean - field phase transitions driven by the increase of @xmath25 , i.e. , the strength of the self - attraction : the transition from the quasi - bound ( leaky ) state to the self - trapped one , which was previously found in single - well elevated potentials @xcite , and the ssb in the dwp structure .",

    "that is , the ssb happens first ( at smaller @xmath25 ) at @xmath84 , while the transition to the self - trapping precedes the ssb at @xmath85 .",
    "the fact that the ssb happens with the trapped and leaky modes , respectively , at small and large @xmath24 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ bifurcation point ] , is easy to explain : small @xmath24 implies strong linear coupling between the wave functions in the two barely separated wells , hence very large @xmath25 is required to induce the ssb , being far greater than the value of @xmath25 needed for the onset of the self - trapping , which is determined by the fixed parameters of the outer barrier in the dwp structure ( [ potential ] ) . on the contrary , large @xmath24 implies weak linear coupling between the strongly separated wells , hence the respective strength of the nonlinearity ( measured by @xmath25 ) , required for the ssb , is much smaller than the value necessary for the commencement of the self - trapping .",
    "these arguments clearly suggest that the same sequence of the ssb and self - trapping phase transitions should take place in generic dwp structures .",

    "[ thetavswidthmapping ] well enough too .    as concerns the trapping regime in area ( 2 ) of figs .",
    "thetavsheightmapping and [ thetavswidthmapping ] , it is explained by the fact that , while slowly passing the left barrier , and then passing the inner one , the soliton with the initial tilt slightly exceeding value ( parabola ) suffers radiation losses due to its deceleration and acceleration .",
    "the losses cause a drop in the kinetic energy below the level necessary for clearing the right barrier . a feature which relates the trapping and splitting to the leaky modes considered above is tunneling of the radiation across the outer potential barriers , which can be seen , in particular , in figs .",
    "[ fundcollisions](b , e , f ) .",
    "we have extended the known possibility of the stabilization of leaky modes in quasi - trapping potentials by means of the self - attractive nonlinearity . unlike the previously studied single - well potential , we have introduced the spatially symmetric dwp ( double - well potential ) with the elevated floor , embedded into the potential barrier .",
    "the setting can be implemented in nonlinear optical waveguides and bec .",
    "the new possibility offered by this system is the competition of two phase transitions of the second kind , described in the mean - field approximation : the onset of the self - trapping of the leaky modes , and the ssb ( spontaneous symmetry breaking ) of both true bound states and leaky modes , under the action of the self - attractive nonlinearity . with the increase of the norm of the wave field ( which determines the nonlinearity strength )",
    ", the former or latter transition happens first if the central barrier of the dwp structure is , respectively , low or tall .",
    "these conclusions are generic , as they do not depend on details of the dwp structure .",
    "new effects are revealed by the consideration of the ssb of the leaky modes : asymmetry of radiation tails , which are parts of these modes , and the commensurability - incommensurability interplay between the radiation wavelength and the total size of the system , into which the dwp is embedded .",
    "systematic results have been produced in the numerical form , and their basic features were explained with the help of analytical considerations .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that unstable symmetric modes initiate josephson oscillations .",
    "collisions of freely moving solitons with the dwp structure were studied in a systematic form too , revealing various generic outcomes of the collisions , boundaries between which were explained in the analytical form . in particular , in addition to the stationary states with the unbroken and broken symmetry , the collisions reveal the dynamical mode , in the form of a soliton which performs persistent shuttle motion in the dwp structure .",
    "relevant possibilities for the extension of the analysis reported in this work may be offered by two - component systems , as well as by a two - dimensional generalization of the present setting . on the other hand ,",
    "the results produced by the competition of the mean - field phase transitions suggest that it may be interesting too to consider quantum phase transitions in a many - body bosonic state with attractive inter - particle interactions , loaded into the dwp .",
