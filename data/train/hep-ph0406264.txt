    "the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions ( sm ) has had an impressive success when confronted with experiment .",
    "however , it has been established that the strength of cp violation in the standard model is not sufficient to account for the cosmological baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau)@xcite .",
    "one of the most attractive mechanisms to generate the observed bau is that of electroweak baryogenesis in supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions of the sm .",
    "it was shown that supersymmetric extensions of the sm have all the necessary requirements to generate enough bau . in particular , susy models offer new sources of cp violation , and in the presence of a light stop the phase transition becomes much stronger  @xcite .",
    "however , the bound of the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) imposes severe constraints on the flavour diagonal phases  @xcite and may possibly rule out scenarios of susy electroweak baryogenesis based on cp violating chargino currents .",
    "a possible way to overcome this problem , and to generate enough bau while satisfying the edm constraints , is to assume that susy cp violation has a flavour character as in the sm  @xcite .",
    "these models share the common features of requiring the presence of a light top - squark and predicting a large mixing between the third and first or second generations of up squarks .",
    "since both the latter requirements play an important role in top - quark physics , one is likely to expect an enhancement in flavour changing top decays .    in sm ,",
    "processes like @xmath10 are absent at the tree level , and are highly suppressed by the gim mechanism at the one - loop level . within the sm , the prediction for the branching ratio ( br ) of these decays is of order @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of @xmath12 decays , either at the lhc or at a future linear @xmath13 collider , will constitute a sign of new physics .",
    "in supersymmetric models , new channels ( mainly through chargino and gluino exchange ) emerge to compete with those of the sm .    in this paper",
    ", we study flavour changing top decays as @xmath14 @xmath15 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with a light right - handed top squark . in order to obtain a model - independent analysis of the low - energy mssm",
    ", we will use the generalised mass insertion approximation ( mia ) . in this framework ,",
    "a basis for fermions and sfermions is adopted in such a way that the couplings of these particles to neutral gauginos are flavour diagonal , while flavour - violating effects are encoded in the non - diagonality of the sfermion propagators .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that one of the eigenvalues of the up - squark mass matrix is much lighter than the other ( degenerate ) eigenvalues .",
    "we take into account the constraints that the relevant mass insertions in the up sector must fulfil in order to generate a successful baryogenesis at the electroweak scale and we consider the bounds on the squark mass insertions derived from experimental measurements of @xmath1 decays . in view of the above",
    ", we investigate the possibility of observing flavour violating top decays at the lhc or at a forthcoming linear collider .",
    "these flavour violating top decays have been previously studied in the literature @xcite and different results were obtained . in this paper , in order to be able to apply easily our approach to any supersymmetric models , we decide to use the generalised mass insertion approximation .",
    "this approach has the great advantages that we shall be able to identified the dominant contributions for any susy models to these processes without ambiguities .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide analytical results of the susy contributions the amplitudes of @xmath16 decays , using the generalised mia .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the presentation of the numerical results , analysing the constraints from bau and fcnc processes and how they affect the branching ratio of these decays .",
    "we also comment on the prospects of observing the @xmath16 process in the upcoming experiments .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section 4 .",
    "the total amplitude for the @xmath18 decay can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the mediator in the loop , and @xmath21 with @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 the momentum of the outgoing photon ( gluon ) .    in the sm",
    ", the @xmath24 decay is mediated by charged @xmath25 bosons , so that @xmath26 . in the framework of the mssm ,",

    "[ fig : tcq ] .",
    "thus the amplitude for the @xmath24 decay can be parametrised as @xmath28    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     both the sm and charged higgs contributions rely on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ( @xmath29 ) as the sole source of flavour violation . in what follows",

    "( [ bau:3i ] ) will not affect the dominant @xmath148 term in the branching ratio contrarly to naive expectations that the large mixing between first / second and the third up - squark generation required for a successfull electroweak baryogenesis implies enhancement in top flavour violating decays branching ratio .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the class of susy models with hermitian or symmetric trilinear couplings , the magnitude of @xmath150 is of the same order @xmath151 , hence the bau leads to a lower bound on the branching ratio @xmath152 of order @xmath153 as it can be seen from fig.[gluinoc ] .    in fig .",

    "regarding the chargino contributions , their contribution is always very suppressed compared to gluino contributions but it is important to emphasize to the fact that their contributions are proportionnal to @xmath172 .",
    "let us recall hat @xmath173 mixing constrains @xmath174 to be of @xmath175  @xcite . nevertheless , the mass insertion @xmath176 is essentially unconstrained since nor @xmath167 limits nor @xmath177 mixing impose any bound on this parameter  @xcite , so that @xmath176 could be of order one .",
    "even so , chargino contributions to @xmath143 can be at most of order @xmath178 , and play a secondary role when compared to those of the gluino .",
    "respect the neutralino contributions , it can be seen from eq.([neutralino ] ) that as in the case of the gluinos , these contributions depend on @xmath166 .",
    "however , their associated coefficients are comparatively more suppressed .",
    "for instance the coefficient of the dominant @xmath179 term is suppressed by a factor @xmath180 which is of order @xmath181 , implying that neutralino contributions will be clearly subdominant when compared to those of the gluino and chargino .    to conclude our analysis , we briefly comment on the experimental prospects for the observation of the susy mediated @xmath182 decays here discussed . first , let us notice that the present cdf limit on these processes is very weak  @xcite @xmath183 however , significant progresses are likely to occur in the near future , with new data from tevatron run ii , which should be able to improve these limits by a factor 10  @xcite . at longer terms , the next generation of colliders as lhc or a linear collider like tesla ,",

    "we have computed in a model - independent way the gluino , chargino and neutralino contributions to the branching ratio of @xmath24 .",
