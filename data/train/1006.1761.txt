    "time @xcite have been discussed extensively .",
    "this has been extended to the cases of schwarzschild  de sitter space - times @xcite as well as to spherically symmetric higher dimensional space  times @xcite . the analytical solutions of the geodesic equation in the kerr space  time have been presented in @xcite .",
    "moreover , solutions of the geodesic equation in the kerr space  time have been given using elliptic functions @xcite , while solutions representing bound orbits parameterized in terms of _ mino time _ @xcite have been presented in @xcite .",
    "spherical orbits in the kerr(anti)de sitter space ",
    "time have been discussed in @xcite , while the general solution to the geodesic equation in ( 4dimensional ) kerr  de sitter @xcite and even general plebanski  demianski space ",
    "times without acceleration has been found @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a fourier expansion has been used to compute the fundamental frequencies for bound orbits using mino time .",
    "these results have direct application in the computation of gravitational waves that are created in extreme mass ratio inspirals , i.e. in binaries in which a stellar object moves on a bound orbit around a supermassive black hole .",
    "cosmic strings have gained a lot of renewed interest over the past years due to their possible connection to string theory @xcite .",
    "these are topological defects @xcite that could have formed in one of the numerous phase transitions in the early universe due to the kibble mechanism .",
    "inflationary models resulting from string theory ( e.g. brane inflation ) predict the formation of cosmic string networks at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "different space - times containing cosmic strings have been discussed in the past .",
    "this study has mainly been motivated by the pioneering work of bach and weyl @xcite describing a pair of black holes held apart by an infinitely thin strut .",
    "this solution has later been reinterpreted in terms of cosmic strings describing a pair of black holes held apart by two cosmic strings extending to infinity in opposite direction .",
    "consequently , a cosmic string piercing a schwarzschild black hole has also been discussed , both in the thin string limit @xcite  where an analytic solution can be given  as well as using the full u(1 ) abelian - higgs model @xcite , where only numerical solutions are available . in the latter case",
    ", these solutions have been interpreted to represent black hole solutions with long range `` hair '' and are thus counterexamples to the no hair conjecture which states that black holes are uniquely characterized by their mass , charge and angular momentum .",
    "interestingly , the solution found in @xcite is a schwarzschild solution which however differs from the standard spherically symmetric case by the replacement of the angular variable @xmath3 by @xmath4 , where the parameter @xmath5 is related to the deficit angle by @xmath6 . in this sense , the space - time is thus not uniquely determined by the mass , but is described by the mass _ and _ deficit angle parameter @xmath5 .",
    "of course , it is then easy to extend known analytically given space  times to the conical case by making the mentioned substitution .    in order to understand details of gravitational fields of massive objects and to be able to predict observational consequences , it is important to understand how test particles move in these space - times .",
    "next to the above mentioned examples the complete set of solutions to the geodesic equation in the space  time of a schwarzschild black hole pierced by a cosmic string has been given recently in @xcite .",
    "the geodesic equation for the motion of test particles in the space  time of an uncharged , rotating black hole in 4 space ",
    "time dimensions ( given by the kerr solution ) pierced by an infinitely thin string aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole has been given in @xcite and spherical orbits and the lense  thirring precession have been discussed . solutions to the geodesic equation in this space  time have also been given in @xcite , but the test particle motion has been restricted to the equatorial plane and gravitomagnetic effects have been studied .",
    "moreover , small perturbations around circular orbits have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the motion of a test scalar quantum particle in the space  time of a kerr  newman black hole pierced by a cosmic string has been discussed in @xcite and it was observed that the presence of a cosmic string alters the corresponding observables .    the aim of this paper is to determine the _ complete set _ of analytic solutions of the geodesic equations in the space  time of a kerr black hole pierced by a cosmic string and to derive analytical expressions for observable effects which can be used for astrophysical searches for such cosmic strings .",
    "the accurate computation of geodesics for massive particles is important in order to understand gravitational wave signals from binaries which can later be compared with eventual gravitational wave measurements .",
    "the computation of geodesics for massless particles is important in order to understand how light signals pass by black holes or other massive objects . moreover",
    ", our work has a direct link to the recently proposed explanation @xcite of the observed alignment of the polarization vector of quasars on cosmological scales @xcite . in @xcite the assumption is used that two originally linked electroweak string loops decayed via the formation of monopole ",
    "antimonopole pairs in the early universe .",
    "the remnants of this decay are interconnected loops of magnetic field whose radii have grown due to the expansion of the universe and today should be on the order of gpc .",
    "interestingly , it was found that the rotation axis of a quasar would align with the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "since the size of the magnetic field loops are much larger than the size of the quasars , we can assume the loop to be approximated by a straight line of magnetic field  that is aligned with the rotation axis of the supermassive black hole in the center of the quasar  at the position of the quasar . if we assume our infinitely thin cosmic string to be a toy model for finite width strings ( e.g. electroweak or abelian ",
    "higgs strings ) where the latter would have a magnetic flux along their axis , the model studied in this paper would describe a quasar with its rotation axis equal to the axis of the magnetic flux .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we give the geodesic equation , in section iii , we classify the solutions , while in section iv , we give the solutions to the geodesic equation and in section v we present examples of orbits . in section",
    "vi we discuss observables such as the perihelion shift and the lense  thirring effect .",
    "we conclude in section vii .",
    "we consider the geodesic equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the christoffel symbol given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is an affine parameter such that for time  like geodesics @xmath11 corresponds to proper time .",
    "the explicit form of the metric that we are studying in this paper reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the angular momentum @xmath16 per mass @xmath17 of the black hole and @xmath18 is the deficit angle parameter that is related to the deficit angle @xmath6 .",
    "this metric describes a kerr black hole pierced by an infinitely thin cosmic string that is aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "the deficit angle appears due to the presence of the cosmic string and can be expressed in terms of the energy per unit length @xmath19 of the cosmic string  : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the typical symmetry breaking scale at which the cosmic string formed and @xmath22 is the planck mass . note that we are using units such that @xmath23 .    for @xmath24",
    "this metric reduces to the schwarzschild solution pierced by an infinitely thin cosmic string @xcite , while for @xmath25 we recover the standard kerr solution .    surfaces with @xmath26 correspond to horizons of the kerr solution with horizon radius @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 sign corresponds to the event horizon , while the @xmath29 sign corresponds to the cauchy horizon .",
    "surfaces with @xmath30 are the static limit and define a killing horizon .",
    "the domain between the event horizon and the static limit is the ergosphere . in the following , we are only interested in non  extremal black hole solutions , i.e. in solutions with @xmath31 .",
    "note that the localization of the horizons and the static limit , respectively are not altered by the presence of the cosmic string .",
    "the boyer - lindquist coordinates ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) are related to cartesian coordinate ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) by @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "hence @xmath38 corresponds to a disc with a deficit angle @xmath39 , while the physical singularity at @xmath38 , @xmath40 is a ring with a deficit angle .",
    "it is then clear  in contrast to the @xmath24 limit  that negative values of @xmath0 are allowed .",
    "when crossing @xmath38 to negative values of @xmath0 one enters into another conical space ",
    "time that however possesses no horizons .",
    "the penrose diagram of this space  time looks exactly like that of the standard kerr space ",
    "time @xcite , however each point in the diagram would correspond to a sphere with deficit angle @xmath39 .",
    "the lagrangian reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 for massive test particles and @xmath43 for massless test particles , respectively .",
    "the killing vectors of this space  time are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the constants of motion are the energy @xmath46 and the angular momentum @xmath47 which are given by the generalized momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 the dot denotes the differentiation with respect to the affine parameter @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the presence of a cosmic string aligned with the rotation axis of the kerr black hole decreases the magnitude of the generalized momenta due to the parameter @xmath5 as compared to the standard kerr space  time .",
    "in particular , for a given energy @xmath46 a particle on the surface defined by @xmath51 ( the static limit ) has larger @xmath52 as compared to the standard kerr case .",
    "there is another constant of motion , namely the carter constant @xmath53 @xcite that appears when separating the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equations @xmath54 which persists in the presence of a cosmic string .",
    "@xmath55 denotes the principal function of hamilton for which we make the following ansatz @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 only , respectively .    by differentiating @xmath55 with respect to the constants @xmath59 , @xmath46 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the modified carter constant , we find the geodesic equations @xmath63 with @xmath64 introducing a new parameter , the so - called _ mino time _ @xcite given by @xmath65 the @xmath0- and @xmath1-component of the geodesic equation can be decoupled @xmath66 for @xmath24 these equations reduce to the equations of motion in a space  time of a schwarzschild black hole pierced by a cosmic string @xcite , while for @xmath25 we recover the geodesic equation in the kerr space  time . as initial conditions we will choose the @xmath28-signs in ( [ rlambda ] ) and ( [ thetalambda ] )",
    "the classification of the solutions of the geodesic equations ( [ rlambda])-([tlambda ] ) can be done with respect to the modified carter constant @xmath67 , the mass of the black hole @xmath17 , the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole @xmath68 as well as the energy @xmath46 and angular momentum @xmath60 of the massive ( @xmath42 ) or massless @xmath69 ) test particle . apparently , the deficit parameter @xmath5 does not appear in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath70 component of the geodesic equation and will hence only influence the @xmath3-motion .      in order to have solutions of the geodesic equation for @xmath0 we have to require @xmath71 .",

    "in particular , the perihelion shift is related to the difference between the angular frequency of the radial motion @xmath251 and the angular frequency of the @xmath3-motion , while the lense  thirring ( lt ) precession is related to the difference between the frequencies of the two angular motions @xmath255 in comparison to the standard kerr space  time with @xmath25 , the frequencies of the perihelion shift @xmath256 and the lense  thirring precession @xmath257 are hence bigger for @xmath258 , i.e. in the kerr space  time including a deficit angle .",
    "this is e.g. clearly seen in fig .  9 , where the perihelion shift increases for decreasing @xmath5 ( see plots in the @xmath32-@xmath33-plane ) and the increase of precession is seen when studying the 3-d orbits .",

    "it would be fascinating to detect cosmic strings in the universe since this detection would open the window to the physics of the very early universe and could prove ( or disprove ) theories such as string theory , supersymmetry and grand unification . in most cases",
    "the prediction of the detection of these objects has focused on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite . here",
    "we discuss another possibility , namely that cosmic strings might be detected due to the way that test particles move in their space  time .",
    "hence , in this paper we have studied the analytical solutions of the geodesic equation in the space  time of a kerr black hole pierced by an infinitely thin cosmic string aligned with the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "we have given the analytical solutions for the @xmath70- , @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath3-components of the geodesic equation in terms of mino time which allows to decouple the @xmath0- and @xmath1-motion .",
    "we see that the main difference to the standard kerr space  time ( which corresponds to the limit of vanishing deficit angle ) is the change of the @xmath3-motion .",
    "in particular the precession of the orbital plane as well as of the orbital ellipse of bound orbits will increase for increasing deficit angle , i.e. increasing energy per unit length of the string . comparing our results with the lageos data , we find that the upper limit for the energy per unit length of a cosmic string piercing the earth is @xmath266 kg / m . our results have also applications in the computation of gravitational wave templates for extreme mass ratio inspirals and to the recently suggested alignment of the polarization vector of quasars , respectively .",
