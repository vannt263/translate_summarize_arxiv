    "a major goal of hadron physics is to understand the spectrum , structure , and interactions of hadrons as a consequence of the strong interactions .",
    "however , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory for strong interactions , is so difficult to solve in the nonperturbative region of low - energy hadron physics that no one is currently able to quantitatively describe the hadron characteristics from first principles . because of this",
    ", effective models are built , trying to keep the essential features of the underlying basic theory , and which hopefully can be solved or at least approximated in a satisfactory way . among these models ,",
    "the constituent quark model is the most successful .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to extend its range of application beyond the traditional static hadronic properties , such as the mass spectrum , to processes that can provide information in a more stringent way about the detailed quark dynamics .",
    "electromagnetic transitions play in this respect a special role , since the photon is a particularly clean probe . on the experimental side",
    ", the opening of cebaf will certainly bring more precise experimental data in the near future .    in its application to the photo - production of nucleon resonances ,",
    "the non - relativistic quark model had to be modified by adding some terms in order to have a consistent theory .",
    "in fact , the study of the photo - production of nucleon resonances has a long history@xcite . in the non - relativistic quark model",
    ", it is begun with the work of koniuk and isgur , based on one - body reduction current@xcite .",
    "later on , close and li stressed the importance of spin - orbit and non - additive terms associated with the wigner rotation of the quark spin transformed from the frame of the recoiling quark to the frame of the recoiling baryon , and also the role of the binding potential@xcite and configuration mixing@xcite . since the spin - orbit ( s - l ) term of one - gluon exchange potential@xcite was ignored in the investigation of baryon spectrum in the isgur model@xcite , most of the authors did not consider the two - body exchange currents corresponding to the one - gluon exchange potential in the calculation of resonance photon decay . however , the s - l term is important in the study of baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "some authors also included it in order to investigate the baryon spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , chiral symmetry is probably the most important feature of qcd in the nonperturbative region@xcite .",
    "this is introduced in the quark model by adding one - pion and one - sigma exchange potentials between constituent quarks .",
    "recently , based on this chiral constituent quark model , buchmann _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the electromagnetic properties of octet and decuplet baryons , including the two - body gluon and meson exchange currents . in their calculations ,",
    "the two - body exchange currents play an important role in the explanation of the nonzero @xmath3 @xmath4 transition@xcite and the neutron charge radius@xcite , and also in order to fit the electromagnetic properties of the octet and decuplet baryons@xcite .",
    "_ included the two - body exchange currents to study the photo - production of the resonance states below @xmath5 gev and obtained a reasonable good agreement with experiment@xcite .    in the first part of this work , based on the chiral constituent quark model@xcite",
    ", we go beyond the work of meyer _",
    "et al._@xcite , calculating the photo - production amplitudes of nucleon resonances up to energies higher than they do , that is up to @xmath6 , and we also include the contributions of the spin - orbit and non - additive terms , in addition to the contributions of the two - body exchange currents .",
    "the effect of nucleon resonances is also important in other electromagnetic transition processes .",
    "in fact , recently there has been much interest in the nucleon spin structure function @xmath1 in the low energy region , where it is mainly saturated by the low - lying resonances . for the proton ,",
    "since @xmath1 satisfies a positive sum rule in the large @xmath7 limit , and the negative gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule in the real photon limit@xcite , there should be a sign - changing in the low @xmath7 region .",
    "theoretically , phenomenological models@xcite have been proposed to study the @xmath7 evolution of the first moments of the nucleon spin structure function in the resonance region . after taking into account the nucleon resonances explicitly ,",
    "the predictions@xcite are in good agreement with the few data points of the slac experiment e143 , although within large experimental errors@xcite , and gave a sign - changing point at a smaller @xmath8 , instead of @xmath9@xcite that was predicted before .",
    "li and dong considered the interference cross section between transverse and longitudinal currents based on a non - relativistic constituent quark model . in their calculation , the contribution of the interference cross section pushes the sign - changing point to around @xmath10@xcite . after including the background contribution , the sign - changing point appears at a smaller energy scale , about @xmath11@xcite .",
    "soffer and teryaev introduced a parametrization to investigate the @xmath7 dependence of gdh sum rule@xcite .",
    "all these calculations indicate that there is a very strong @xmath7 dependence behavior on the evolution of the nucleon spin structure function due to the resonance contributions . in order to reliably perform the saturation ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account all kinds of effects carefully , and that is what we plan to do here .    in section",
    "ii of this paper , we calculate the photo - production amplitudes of nucleon resonances up to energies of @xmath6 , including both the relativistic corrections and the two - body exchange currents",
    ". furthermore , we also study the effects of the two - body exchange currents in the nucleon spin structure function and gdh sum rule in the resonance region in section iii .",
    "finally a summary and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "the helicity amplitudes of nucleon excitations are defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the helicity of resonance @xmath14 with total angular moment @xmath15 . the electromagnetic transition operator @xmath16 is composed of one - body non - relativistic reduction term , spin - orbit and non - additive terms ( the last two terms , first introduced by brodsky and primack@xcite , are called collectively as @xmath0)@xcite , @xmath17 in fact , it is more convenient to calculate the transition amplitudes in the form of current matrix elements . for real photons , we have @xmath18 in which @xmath19 is the photon transverse polarization vector , @xmath20 is the four momentum transfer of the photon in the center of mass frame , @xmath21 is the electromagnetic current corresponding to the transition operator @xmath16 , and which can be easily obtained from @xmath16 as : @xmath22 + \\left \\ { \\vec{p}_i , e^{i\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{r}_i}\\right \\ } \\right ) , \\label{enr } \\\\",

    ", we have @xmath39 due to the parity and angular momentum conservation , only one electric and one magnetic multipole operators contribute to the helicity amplitudes .    in this work",
    "we study the photo - production amplitudes of nucleon resonances based on the chiral constituent quark model@xcite , which includes not only the one - gluon exchange potential , but also the one - pion and one - sigma exchange potentials to model chiral symmetry breaking of qcd in the nonperturbative region .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the s - l term in the one - gluon exchange potential is important in baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "furthermore , when it is included in the study of the baryon spectrum , and because of gauge invariance , it is necessary to consider its effects , namely the two - body gluon exchange current @xmath40 , which turns out to be important in the investigation of the electromagnetic transitions@xcite .",
    "there exist several methods to derive the two - body gluon exchange current , such as the minimal electromagnetic coupling method and the feynman diagram method .",
    "_ derived it by the feynman diagram approach@xcite .",
    "in addition , the gauge invariant currents corresponding to the one - pion exchange potential are the pion - pair current @xmath41 and the pionic current @xmath42 , which are also derived using feynman diagrams .",
    "explicit expressions for all these two - body exchange currents can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quark mass was treated as free parameter in order to include the contributions of the scalar potentials . here",
    ", we will investigate the contributions of the scalar potentials carefully .",
    "_ found that the scalar potentials contribute significantly to the electromagnetic properties of the octet and decuplet baryons . according to eq.(2.10 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , to @xmath43 we have @xmath44 in the chiral constituent quark model@xcite , the scalar potentials include a two - body harmonic oscillator confinement potential @xmath45 and a one - sigma exchange potential @xmath46 .",
    "thus , in the chiral constituent quark model@xcite , the total electromagnetic current @xmath47 , which satisfies the gauge invariance condition , should be given by a sum of one - body non - relativistic reduction , spin - orbit , non - additive , and two - body exchange currents : @xmath48    in our calculations the model wave function is the standard @xmath49 , all the parameters are the same as in ref.@xcite , and the phase convention of koniuk and isgur@xcite is used . our main purpose is to investigate the role of the two - body exchange currents , and spin - orbit and non - additive terms , in the photo - production of nucleon resonances . as a first step",
    ", we will neglect the configuration mixing effects .",
    "we also neglect the finite electromagnetic size of constituent quarks used in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , this is easy to take into account , by multiplying every photo - production amplitude by a monopole form factor @xmath50 .",
    "all the calculations are made in the center mass frame and the results are shown in the tables [ tab1 ] and tables [ tab2 ] .",
    "the experimental data are given by the most recent particle data review of particle physics@xcite .",
    "we can see that the two - body exchange currents play an important role , especially the confinement current , in the photo - production of nucleon resonances .",
    "for the resonance @xmath51 , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , the theoretical overestimate versus experimental result does not exist anymore .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the roper resonance @xmath52 agrees with experiment due to the two - body exchange currents , and not to the configuration mixing@xcite .",
    "another example is the @xmath53 proton excitation amplitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for which the two - body exchange currents give a nonzero contribution , although it is not in the right direction .",
    "however , for @xmath56 , the theoretical result is still far below the experimental data because the two - body exchange currents cancel each other . comparing with the large contributions to the @xmath57 and @xmath58 resonances , the contributions of the two - body exchange currents to the @xmath59 resonances are smaller , but they are still important to some @xmath59 resonances .    on the other side ,",
    "we confirm the results of close and li@xcite , that the relativistic corrections @xmath0 are important in most cases .",
    "_ stressed the role of the two - body exchange currents on the photo - production of the resonance states with masses below @xmath60@xcite , but the relativistic corrections @xmath0 are neglected in their calculations .",
    "in fact , after considering the contributions of both the two - body exchange currents and @xmath0 , the agreement with experimental is improved , specially for the resonances @xmath61 and @xmath56 .",
    "the nucleon spin structure in the resonances region is mainly saturated by the nucleon resonances of photo- and electro - production .",
    "extending the calculation of the photo - production to electro - production is straightforward .",
    "however , the electro - production of resonances will become highly relativistic when the momentum transfer @xmath62 increases .",
    "we will follow the method of li and close@xcite in order to remove the exponential decay with @xmath62 .",
    "this method was first used by foster and hughes in order to study the electro - production in the equal - velocity frame@xcite .",

    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the photon flux @xmath71 as `` photon equivalent energy '' @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the total c.m .",

    "furthermore , in order to connect smoothly with the gdh sum rule @xmath95 at @xmath96 and with the sum rules for @xmath97 at high @xmath7 , and based on the assumption that the main contribution comes from vector meson intermediate states at @xmath98 , the non - resonant part is modeled as in ref .",

    "based on a chiral constituent quark model , we have calculated the photo - production amplitudes of all the nucleon resonances with masses below @xmath94 , and the first moment of the nucleon spin structure function @xmath63 , including both relativistic corrections and those two - body exchange currents corresponding to the one - gluon exchange , one - pion exchange , one - sigma exchange and confinement potentials .",
    "we find that the two - body exchange currents required by gauge invariance , specially the exchange current corresponding to the confinement potential , play an important role in most cases .",
    "but for @xmath59 nucleon resonances , the two - body exchange currents are less important . after taking into account the effects of both the two - body exchange currents and the relativistic corrections , the fit to experiment",
    "is improved .",
    "it is known that the first moment of the nucleon spin structure function @xmath63 is strongly @xmath7 depended below @xmath120 , and we obtain a sign change at @xmath121 .",
    "this strong @xmath7 dependence means that in order to obtain a reliable theoretical prediction , the saturation of resonances should be performed carefully , and that is what we have done in this paper .",
    "we mainly concentrated on the effects of the two - body exchange currents and relativistic effects , and did not consider configuration mixing effects .",
    "however , it is known that these effects have some contribution to resonance photo - production@xcite .",
    "furthermore , in order to compare with experiment , the @xmath62 dependence of helicity amplitudes also needs to be calculated .",
