    "one of the direct phenomenological predictions of inflationary cosmological models is the generation of a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( gw s ) . for `` slow - roll '' inflationary models",
    "this prediction is hardly testable : since the spectrum is almost flat over the huge frequency band @xmath0  @xcite , in the window @xmath1 , where ground - based gw experiments operate , the maximum value of the energy spectrum @xmath2 compatible with the cobe measurements of the cosmic micro - wave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations at large scales  @xmath3  @xcite  is well below the sensitivity expected for the third generation of detectors , @xmath4",
    ".    `` pre - big - bang '' ( pbb ) models  @xcite represent an alternative to the standard `` slow - roll '' inflationary scenario . in a minimal pbb model",
    ", one assumes that the initial state is the perturbative vacuum of super - string theory , the flat 10-dimensions minkowski space - time ; the universe goes first through an inflationary phase where the curvature and the string coupling increase , eventually reaches a `` stringy epoch '' where the curvature scale is of order one in units of the string length , and finally evolves into a typical decelerated radiation / matter dominated era .",
    "the inflationary pbb phase has a precise consequence on the structure of @xmath5 , which affects the detectability of the stochastic background by laser interferometers , whose `` science - runs '' are expected to begin at the end of 2001 : in the low frequency range , the spectrum is characterized by a steep power law , @xmath6  @xcite ; indeed the cobe bound is easily evaded , and the spectrum can peak at frequencies of interest for gw experiments , while satisfying the existing experimental bounds  @xcite .    for the rather general class of minimal pbb models , @xmath5 depends on two free parameters : ( i ) the red - shift @xmath7 of the high - curvature phase , which fixes the `` knee '' frequency @xmath8 between the low and high frequency regime ( @xmath9 hz is the cut - off frequency of the spectrum , whose exact value is irrelevant for the issues discussed here ) ; ( ii ) the value @xmath10 of the string coupling at the onset of the high - curvature phase , which determines the high - frequency slope of the spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show @xmath5 for two choices of the free parameters ; varying @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the maximum value of the spectrum compatible with the constraints due to pulsar timing data and to the abundance of light elements at the nucleosynthesis epoch is @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 strongly depends on @xmath11 and @xmath10 : they affect both the frequency behaviour and the peak value of the spectrum .",
    "whether gw experiments will be able or not to detect a signal predicted by pbb models does depend on the actual value of the `` true '' parameters .",
    "indeed , gw experiments represent one of the very few avenues where the cosmological models can be verified , and could open a new era for studies of the very - early universe and the structure of fundamental fields at high energies  @xcite .",
    "the emphasis of this contribution is not on finding the best theoretical scenario which would guarantee a detection .",
    "the goal of our analysis is to address to which extent gw observations can test pbb models , and more in detail to identify the the region of the free - parameter space that experiments can probe . a similar analysis , in the context of string cosmology models , was carried out in  @xcite .",
    "in order to address whether a background characterized by a given energy spectrum @xmath13 is indeed detectable or not , one needs to evaluate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) that can be obtained by cross - correlating the output of two detectors as a function of the model parameters , in our case @xmath11 and @xmath10 ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the data analysis issues related to the detection of a stochastic background have been thoroughly discussed in  @xcite , where the reader can find full details . here",
    "we recall only the expression of the signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath14^{1/2}\\ , .",
    "\\label{snr_opt}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ snr_opt ] ) @xmath15 is the observation time  which is usually assumed to be a few months long ",
    "@xmath16 km sec@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 is the hubble constant , @xmath18 is the noise spectral density of the @xmath19th detector , and @xmath20 is the overlap reduction function .",
    "the spectrum @xmath21 for minimal pbb models is given in  @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ] summarizes the results : it shows the contour plots of snr for @xmath22sec which can be achieved by cross - correlating the two 4-km ligo interferometers located in hanford and livingston .",
    "the contours are drawn in the relevant 2-dimensional parameter space : in order to highlight the physical content , our parameter choice corresponds to @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; here @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the gauge coupling at the unification scale ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the two free - parameters of the models are defined over the following range : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in our analysis",
    "we have considered the estimated noise spectral density for the initial , enhanced and advanced ligo configuration ( the so - called ligo i , ii , and iii , respectively ) .    for initial ligo ,",
    "the minimum value of a detectable stochastic background is @xmath30 , cfr .",
    "also  @xcite , and therefore the experiments can not provide any direct hint about pbb models : the maximum value of snr , for fined - tuned parameters of the model , is just below one .",
    "however , the enhanced ligo configuration will allow us to explore a relatively large parameter region : for snr @xmath31 , one can probe models where @xmath10 differs by one order of magnitude with respect to its present value @xmath32 and about eight orders of magnitude in @xmath8 ; the snr reaches a maximum @xmath33 when @xmath34 .",
    "the advanced ligo configuration  which however requires major technological developments  will enlarge the @xmath10-range that one can test by more than one order of magnitude ; for selected parameter values the experiment could reach snr @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the experiments are very sensitive to @xmath10 , and achieve the maximum snr for @xmath36 .",
    "one might wonder whether other interferometers and/or resonant detectors could provide relevant information for the problem at hand .",
    "unfortunately the location , orientation and sensitivity of virgo , geo600 and tama are such that any search involving one of these three instruments will not allow to detect a stochastic background of pbb gravitons ; just as reference , a virgo - geo600 cross - correlation experiment will reach @xmath37 for an integration time of 4-months .",
    "neither resonant antenna are suitable : two `` bars '' operating at the quantum limit with exactly the same resonance frequency would reach a maximum sensitivity @xmath30 ( see also  @xcite ) , which is a factor @xmath38 worse than the one required for the most optimistic theoretical prediction ; experiments involving hollow spheres  @xcite , which are currently under study , could reach @xmath39 for detectors operating at the quantum limit and co - located ; this would produce a snr @xmath40 for a pbb model whose parameters are such that the peak of @xmath5 is right in the middle of the sphere frequency band .",
    "minimal pbb models predict a gw stochastic background which could be detectable by cross - correlating the two ligo instruments  or , more in general , two interferometers at a distance @xmath41 km and quasi - optimally oriented  with a sensitivity which is intermediate between the first and second stage . in the time frame 2004 - 2005 ,",
    "when the detectors are expected to operate in the so - called enhanced configuration , we will be able to place experimental constraints on pbb models for a fairly large portion of the free - parameter space .",
    "a more detailed analysis regarding the issues discussed here is currently in preparation .",
