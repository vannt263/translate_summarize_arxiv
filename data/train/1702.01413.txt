    "in 1905 henri poincar first suggested that accelerated masses in a relativistic field should produce gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the idea was magisterially pursued by einstein via his celebrated theory of general relativity . in 1918",
    "he published his famous quadrupole formula resulting from the calculation of the effect of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "a century later , the ligo scientific collaboration and virgo collaboration published a paper about the gravitational radiation they had detected on september 2015 @xcite .",
    "ever since scientists believe to have entered in a new era of astronomy , whereby the universe will be studied by ` its sound ' @xcite .",
    "gravitational sound ( gs ) signals will then be here scrutinized with advanced techniques .    in the signal processing field ,",
    "the problem of finding a sparse approximation for a signal consists in expressing the signal as a superposition of as few elementary components as possible , without significantly affecting the quality of the reconstruction . in signal processing applications",
    "the approximation is carried out on a signal partition , i.e. , by dividing the signal into small pieces and constructing the approximation for each of those pieces of data .",
    "traditional techniques would carry out the task using an orthogonal basis .",
    "however , enormous improvements in sparsity can be achieved using an adequate over - complete ` dictionary ' and an appropriate mathematics method .",
    "for the most part , these methods are based on minimization of the @xmath0-norm @xcite or are greedy pursuit strategies @xcite , the latter being much more effective in practice",
    ".    sparse signal representation of sound signals is a valuable tool for a number of auditory tasks @xcite .",
    "moreover , the emerging theory of compressive sensing @xcite has enhanced the concept of sparsity by asserting that the number of measurements needed for accurate representation of a signal informational content decreases if the sparsity of the representation improves .",
    "hence , when some gs tones made with the observed gravitation wave ( gw ) were released , we felt motivated to produce a sparse approximation of those clips .",
    "we simply analyze the gs tones from a processing viewpoint , regardless on how and why they have been generated . we consider a ) a short tone made with the chirp that has been detected , b ) the theoretical simulated theoretical gs , , and c ) the ring tone , which is a more complex signal produced by superposition with an ad hoc independent percussive sound",
    ". the ensuing results are certainly interesting . if , in the future , gs signals are to be generated at large scale ( as astronomical images have been produced @xcite )",
    ", it is important to have tools for all kinds of processing of those signals .",
    "_ the central goal of this communication is to present evidences of the significant gain in sparsity achieved if a gs signal is approximated with high quality outside the orthogonal basis framework_. for demonstration purposes we have made available the matlab routines for implementation of the method .",
    "the traditional frequency decomposition of a signal given by @xmath1 sample points , @xmath2 , involves the fourier expansion @xmath3 the values @xmath4 are called the discrete fourier spectrum of the signal , and can be evaluated in a very effective manner via the fast fourier transform ( fft ) . for @xmath5 even if the coefficients in the above expansion can still be calculated via fft , by zero padding , these are not longer unique . finding a sparse solution is the goal of sparse approximation techniques .",
    "the problem of the sparse approximation of a signal , outside the orthogonal basis setting , consists in using elements of a redundant set , called a _",
    "dictionary _ , for constructing an approximation involving a number of elementary components which is significantly smaller than the signal dimension . for signals",
    "whose structure varies with time , sparsity performs better when the approximation is carried out on a signal partition . in order to give precise definitions we introduce at this point the notational usual conventions :",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the sets of real and complex and numbers , respectively .",

    "a partition of a signal @xmath17 is represented as a set of disjoint pieces , @xmath18 , henceforth to be called ` blocks ' , which , without loss of generality , are assumed to be all of the same size and such that @xmath19 . denoting by @xmath20 the concatenation operator ,",
    "the signal @xmath17 is ` assembled ' from the blocks as @xmath21 .",
    "this operation implies that the first @xmath22 components of the vector @xmath23 are given by the vector @xmath24 , the next @xmath25 components by the vector @xmath26 , and so on .",

    "is then obtained simply by joining the approximation for the blocks as @xmath32 where @xmath33 .      the problem of finding the minimum number of @xmath34 terms such that @xmath35 , for a given tolerance parameter @xmath36 , is an np - hard problem @xcite . in practical applications ,",

    "however , with @xmath80 the ohbw version for selecting dct coefficients improves in this case the standard dct result , attaining sr=6.2 . for an approximation of the same quality ( snr=40 db ) the sr rendered by the ohbw - oomp method with @xmath88 and",

    "an interesting description of a the signal variation is rendered by a local measure of sparsity .",
