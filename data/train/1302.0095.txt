    "<S> all these results indicate , rather than the gas - clumping effect , that the bulk of the icm in the cluster outskirts is far from hydrostatic equilibrium and infalling matter retained some of its kinetic energy . finally , combining with our recent _ suzaku _ and lensing analysis of abell  1689 , a cluster of similar mass , temperature , and redshift , </S>",
