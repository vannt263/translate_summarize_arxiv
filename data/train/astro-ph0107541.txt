    "the deep2 survey @xcite will commence in the spring of 2002 , with the anticipated delivery of the deimos spectrograph @xcite to keck in the fall of 2001 .",
    "the survey will use approximately 120 keck nights over a period of three years to study galaxy properties , evolution , and large - scale structure at @xmath20 1 .",
    "the deep2 survey will obtain spectra for @xmath060,000 galaxies between @xmath21 0.71.5 . the current plan is to use an 830 l mm@xmath22 grating with 0.75 @xmath23 slitwidths , resulting in a spectral resolution of 86 km s@xmath22 .",
    "we thus expect to easily measure linewidths to this limit and redshifts to 10% of this limit .",
    "the survey will target four 2@xmath6 by 0.5@xmath6 fields , which corresponds to a total comoving area of 80 by 20 @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 at @xmath20 1 for a @xmath5cdm universe .",
    "the line - of - sight comoving distance for @xmath21 0.71.5 is @xmath01400 @xmath10 mpc , though in our magnitude - limited survey we will not sample the higher - redshift region very densely .",
    "the four fields were chosen as low - extinction regions which are continuously observable from hawaii over a six month interval .",
    "one field is the groth survey strip , and two fields are on the equatorial strip which will be deeply imaged by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "each of these fields are targets of a cfht survey conducted by kaiser and luppino , with the primary goal of deep imaging in b , r , and i bands for weak lensing studies @xcite .",
    "we will use their photometric information to color - select galaxies with @xmath26 0.7 and @xmath27 23.5 for the deep2 survey .",
    "this color - selection allows us to focus on the high-@xmath17 universe .",
    "one of the key science goals of the deep2 survey is to measure the two - point and higher - order correlation functions of galaxies at @xmath20 1 as a function of other observables . in almost all models of structure formation ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", galaxies are born as highly biased tracers of the mass distribution , but their bias diminishes with time .",
    "spiral galaxies today appear to be weakly biased , if at all , while the clustering of @xmath20 3 lyman - break galaxies requires a large bias for any reasonable cosmological model @xcite .",
    "galaxies at @xmath20 1 should have an intermediate degree of bias , with readily observable consequences .",
    "the statistical clustering of galaxies at any epoch depends on both the underlying dark matter distribution and the biasing function ; the two are degenerate without more information .",
    "however , models suggest that patterns exist in the _ relative _ biases between various types of galaxies , and measuring these patterns as a function of absolute luminosity , linewidth , or spectral type can break that degeneracy . with sufficiently dense sampling , determining the clustering properties of galaxies can yield direct measurements of their biasing .",
    "for example , in linear biasing models [ where @xmath28 is assumed to be some constant @xmath29 , the mean ratio of the skewness of the density distribution function to the square of its variance has an expectation value that scales as @xmath30 @xcite",
    ". we will be able to subdivide the deep2 sample as a function of internal linewidth and estimate @xmath31 for each type of galaxy .",
    "the sampling density of the survey is such that we will be able to obtain spectra for three - quarters of all galaxies down to @xmath32 at the redshifts of interest .",
    "comparison of such measures at @xmath33 to their values at @xmath34 will then be possible .",
    "deimos has a field of view of 16@xmath35 by 5@xmath35 for both imaging and multislit spectroscopy and will use an array of eight 2k by 4k lincoln laboratory 30 @xmath36 thick ccds , with an active 2-d flexure compensation system to minimize fringing at red wavelengths .",
    "as the deep2 survey will target four fields of 120@xmath35 by 30@xmath35 , slitmasks will be made from a region of size 16@xmath35 by 4@xmath35 with two rows of 60 masks each .",
    "there will be @xmath0130 slitlets per mask , with most of the slitlets aligned along the long axis , but with some tilted as much as @xmath37 to track extended galaxies in order to measure rotation curves .",
    "the mean surface density of candidate galaxies exceeds the number of objects we can select , and spectra of selected targets can not be allowed to overlap on the ccd .",
    "adjacent slitmasks will overlap by 2 @xmath35 so that each galaxy will have two chances to be selected for a mask .",
    "spectra will be obtained for @xmath070@xmath38 of the targeted galaxies in the fields meeting our color and magnitude selection criteria , chosen by a slitmask algorithm which is necessarily biased against the highest - density regions , where the spectra of nearby galaxies would overlap on the ccd .",
    "here we test how this bias will affect our measurement of the underlying two - point and three - point correlation functions .",
    "this paper uses a family of mock catalogs to model large - scale structure studies that will be possible with the deep2 survey data .",
    "section 2 describes the construction of the mock catalogs while section 3.1 provides results of analysis of two - point correlation studies in @xmath15 .",
    "the high resolution spectroscopy of deep2 will allow redshift space distortions to be readily measured , as discussed in section 3.2 .",
    "this in turn will allow for a measurement of the small - scale thermal velocities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , described in section 3.3 . in section 3.4 we show that we can measure the three - point correlation function @xmath9 with minimal bias .",
    "section 3.5 discusses the ability to measure the evolution of clustering _ within _ the volume of the deep2 survey .",
    "we expect to have the sensitivity to detect evolving bias and evolving @xmath18 .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present general discussion and conclusions .",
    "we constructed mock catalogs from the hubble volume and gif simulations made by the virgo consortium ( www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/virgo/ ) . to match the deep2 survey",
    ", our mock catalogs cover 2@xmath6 by 0.5@xmath6 on the sky , with a redshift range of z=0.71.5 . for both simulations we use the @xmath5cdm models with @xmath39=0.3 , @xmath40=0.7 , @xmath41=0.7 , and @xmath18=0.9 .",
    "the hubble volume project produced deep - wedge geometry lightcone outputs from simulations of 10@xmath42 particles which include smooth clustering evolution as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "the lightcone output is designed to match what an observer would see and uses propagating output filters at the speed of light through the simulation in order to produce images which have evolution in the redshift direction .",
    "the @xmath5cdm simulation covered a comoving cube of length 3000 @xmath10 mpc , and we constructed 16 independent catalogs from subsets of the lightcone output .",
    "the hubble volume simulations have a mass resolution of 2.25 10@xmath43 @xmath10 @xmath44 per particle and a softening scale of 100 kpc @xmath10 .",
    "we only use particles in the simulation which are labeled `` galaxies '' in the l2 bias model , determined from the initial overdensity field at that location as described in @xcite .",
    "this bias model has both a lower and upper threshold cutoff in the overdensity field inside of which `` galaxies '' will form .",
    "this results in an enhancement of voids as well as creates a small anti - bias needed in @xmath5cdm models to match observed galaxy correlations on small scales @xcite .",
    "we also use simulations from the gif project , which combine much higher - resolution n - body simulations with semi - analytic models to study formation and evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the particle mass of the gif simulations is 10@xmath45 @xmath44 .",
    "these simulations are in the form of `` snapshots '' of comoving cubes at various redshift intervals .",
    "the cubes are 141 @xmath10 mpc on a side , and we use outputs at z=0.62 , 0.82 , and 1.05 . in order to produce catalogs which continuously cover z=0.71.5",
    ", we had to stack two z=0.62 cubes , three z=0.82 cubes , and five z=1.05 cubes in the redshift direction .",
    "since the cubes can be randomly oriented , and 141 @xmath10 mpc corresponds to @xmath0 5@xmath6 at z=0.6 and 3.5@xmath6 at z=1.0 , we were able to select 2@xmath6 by 0.5@xmath6 subsets of different orientations from each cube when stacking them , thereby reducing structure replication in the redshift direction in our mock catalogs .",
    "we constructed 6 separate mock catalogs from the gif simulations , roughly equal to the number of independent catalogs which could be made from the gif galaxy simulation output .",
    "there is , however , some replication at @xmath46 1.0 , where we had to stack more cubes from the same snapshot output .    to assign each galaxy a redshift",
    ", we assumed a @xmath5cdm cosmology with the following relation between comoving distance and redshift : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the comoving distance in units of @xmath10 mpc and @xmath49=0.3 and @xmath50=0.7 . to analyze both the hubble volume and gif simulation mock catalogs in redshift space we added the peculiar velocity along the line of sight , @xmath51 ( km s@xmath22 ) , to the zero - peculiar - velocity - redshift , @xmath52 : @xmath53 in the analysis of the redshift space catalogs , the relations between @xmath17 and @xmath48 are inverted , and we convert the new @xmath17 to a given @xmath48 .",
    "note that one must assume an underlying cosmology to analyze high - redshift catalogs , and if the assumed model is incorrect the resulting statistics will be distorted .",
    "as the simulations provide a volume - limited sample , we apply a selection function to our mock catalogs to mimic the @xmath54 @xmath55 unknown selection function of the magnitude - limited deep2 survey . for the hubble volume simulations we follow the prescription of @xcite for @xmath56 models and integrate a schechter luminosity function in redshift bins .",
    "we conservatively use a model with no luminosity evolution as a pessimistic case from which to estimate the correlation amplitudes and errors , as the no - evolution model has fewer galaxies at high-@xmath17 than models with evolution . after applying this selection function",
    ", we then randomly dilute the density of galaxies uniformly at all redshifts to match the observed surface density of high-@xmath17 objects in our cfht photometry fields of @xmath0 5 galaxies arcmin@xmath57 .",
    "we expect to successfully measure redshifts for approximately 80@xmath38 of our observed sample of galaxies in the survey , and so we further dilute the mock catalog by an additional 20@xmath38 .",
    "the resulting mock catalogs , each corresponding to one of our four fields , contain @xmath018,000 galaxies .",
    "in figure [ hubblemock ] we plot one of our mock hubble volume catalogs in both real and redshift space , collapsed along the smallest axis .",
    "the no - evolution selection function applied to the mock catalogs is shown in figure [ sf]@xmath54 , along with the redshift distribution of galaxies in one of the catalogs in figure [ sf]@xmath31 .",
    "the gif simulations contain absolute magnitudes in @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for each galaxy , which we use to create a flux - limited subsample from our mock catalogs .",
    "we make an apparent @xmath58-band cut of 23.4 mag , which at @xmath631 corresponds to an apparent @xmath61-band mag with the appropriate k - correction , resulting in flux - limited catalogs of @xmath019,000 galaxies .",
    "an image of one of our gif mock catalogs is shown in figure [ gifmock ] in redshift space .",
    "the redshift distribution of these catalogs agrees quite well with that of the hubble volume mock catalogs .",
    "figure [ gifmock ] also shows the results of our target selection on one of the gif mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "the middle panel shows galaxies which would be targeted to be on a slitmask , while the lower panel shows galaxies for which we would not be able to obtain spectra .",
    "the map of galaxies missed by our selection procedure traces the same structure as the map of our targeted galaxies .",
    "the gif simulations match our current cfht photometry quite well in terms of the projected angular correlation @xmath7 , notably at small separations of @xmath6420 arcsec .",
    "this holds for all the galaxies as well as subsamples selected by color .",
    "we therefore use the gif mock catalogs to estimate how well we will measure the two- and three - point correlation functions and their redshift distortions , and to test the effects of our target selection algorithm , which is most strongly biased on small projected scales on the sky . the hubble volume simulations do not have the mass resolution to match the projected correlation amplitudes on small scales but do have the advantage of continuous clustering evolution with redshift .",
    "we use both the hubble volume and gif simulations to estimate how well we will measure @xmath18 as a function of redshift in the deep2 survey .",
    "the two - point correlation function is defined as the excess probability above random that a pair of galaxies exists with a given separation ( see peebles 1980 for details ) .",
    "this statistic is a simple way to characterize the amount of clustering seen in the galaxy distribution .",
    "we present in figure [ xisp.mean ] the average two - point correlation analysis @xmath15 of the six gif mock galaxy catalogs , as a function of separation across the line of sight ( @xmath65 ) and along the line of sight ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the thick solid contour traces where the correlation amplitude is equal to 1.0 , and the scale length of the clustering is roughly 6.0 @xmath10 mpc in real space as seen on the @xmath65-axis .",
    "the dotted contours are 1@xmath19 standard deviations derived from the six independent catalogs .",
    "these contours are quite confined , confirming that the deep2 design will lead to strong constraints on the clustering of distant galaxies .",
    "there is , however , significant covariance among the residuals .",
    "the covariance matrix is comprised of correlation coefficients @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the covariance between points @xmath70 and @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the square root of the variance of point @xmath70 .",
    "the values of the covariance matrix are high , above 0.75 for scales of 5  20 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "this is not surprising , suggesting that poorly sampled large - scale modes dominate the errors .",
    "error analysis in the real data will need to account for this covariance .",
    "a critical function of the gif mock catalogs is to test the effects of the target - selection algorithm on the measured two - point correlation function .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ xisp.mask ] . here",
    "we plot the mean two - point correlation amplitude @xmath15 for all the galaxies in our catalogs in solid contours as well as for only those galaxies selected to be on slitmasks in dotted contours .",
    "the correlation amplitude for targeted galaxies alone is lower than for all the galaxies , as expected .",
    "we also show in figure [ xisp.mask ] the result of a simple correction for this bias . for galaxies",
    "not targeted to be on slitmasks , we substitute the redshift of the nearest neighbor on the sky which was targeted and is within the expected photometric redshift error of @xmath17=0.1 of the un - targeted galaxy and use its redshift as that of the un - targeted galaxy . in this way we use the angular information and the photometric redshift of the un - targeted galaxies and",
    "can partially recover the amplitude errors in the correlation analysis .",
    "this correction works extremely well on large scales , @xmath735 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "the correction underestimates the `` finger of god '' effect on small scales ( @xmath645 @xmath10 mpc ) , where it effectively positions the un - targeted galaxies at the identical physical distances of the nearest neighbors on the sky , thereby reducing the effect of random thermal motion .",
    "the conclusion is that the target - selection bias can be corrected in a simple manner on scales @xmath735 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "the most straightforward means of dealing with the resulting bias on small scales will probably be to filter all models by the same selection procedure , to estimate the degree to which the targeted galaxies are underestimating the correlation amplitude .",
    "the mock catalogs can be used to quantify the precision with which we can measure redshift distortions in the two - point correlation function @xmath15 in the deep2 survey .",
    "redshift distortions are expected on small scales due to the random internal velocities of galaxies in groups and clusters , creating so - called `` fingers of god '' on small scales ( @xmath64 5 @xmath10 mpc ) .",
    "this effect can be seen in the redshift two - point correlation function @xmath15 shown in figure [ xisp.mean ] as the elongation along the y - axis ( separation along the line of sight ) at small scales . on larger scales a flattening of the two - point correlation function contours can be seen , which is due to coherent infall of galaxies resulting from the gravitational pull of large forming superclusters . a standard method by which to quantify these redshift - space distortions is to measure @xmath13/@xmath14 , the quadrupole to monopole moments of the two - point correlation function @xcite .",
    "the multipole moments of the two - point correlation function are defined as @xmath74    @xmath13/@xmath14 is greater than zero on small scales where the `` fingers of god '' are apparent and less than zero on large scales where coherent infall appears .",
    "figure [ gifq ] plots @xmath13/@xmath14 as a function of redshift separation , with 1@xmath19 errors as derived from the six separate gif mock catalogs . unlike the measurement of @xmath15 ,",
    "the covariance matrix is large only on large scales , greater than 12 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "the bias of our target selection procedure can be seen as the dotted line , and the correction discussed in the last section is shown with a dashed line . as with the @xmath15 statistic",
    ", the effect of target selection is to slightly decease the amplitude of @xmath13/@xmath14 on all scales",
    ". the applied correction increases @xmath13/@xmath14 on scales @xmath735 h@xmath22 mpc and underestimates it on small scales . we will need to apply a bias correction to account for this in the survey .",
    "however , the mock catalogs show clearly that the correlation anisotropy will be robustly detected in the deep2 survey .",
    "the amount of flattening seen on large scales constrains the parameter @xmath75 , where @xmath31 is the bias between the galaxy and dark matter clustering . in linear theory ,",
    "@xmath76 where @xmath77 = ( 3+@xmath78 and @xmath79 is the index of the two - point correlation function in a power - law form : @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "our 1@xmath19 errors plotted in figure [ gifq ] show that in one of our slices we should be able to measure @xmath16 to within + / 0.2 , so that for our full sample of four slices our error on @xmath16 should be + /",
    "0.1 . in order to extract @xmath49 from our measurement of @xmath16 we will need to know the _",
    "absolute _ bias of our galaxy sample , which we may be able to determine from our measurements of the three - point correlation function relative to the two - point function ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "the pairwise velocity dispersion is a parameter which measures the small - scale thermal motions of galaxies and probes the mass density of the universe .",
    "it has been measured to be around 400 - 500 km s@xmath22 for various redshift surveys at low-@xmath17 ( e.g. fisher et al .",
    "1994 ; marzke et al .",
    "1995 ; jing , mo , & brner 1998 ) . in this analysis",
    ", we confine our test to a measurement of the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath11 by comparing @xmath15 in real and redshift space on the scale of @xmath65=1 @xmath10 mpc , where the `` finger of god '' effect dominates redshift distortions .",
    "( in this section we will use a subscript r to indicate real space . ) for this analysis we use the flux - limited mock catalog before slit selection , averaged over all 6 catalogs .",
    "following @xcite , we first define @xmath81\\ ] ] in both real and redshift space , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , for values of @xmath84 20 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "we then normalize @xmath83 so that our subsequent fitting will be sensitive to the overall shape of @xmath83 but insensitive to the amplitude : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the maximum value of @xmath66 used in the analysis ( here @xmath86=20 @xmath10 mpc ) .    within the mock catalogs , the pair - weighted dispersion of the known peculiar velocities is 500 km s@xmath22 for galaxies with radial separations @xmath8720 @xmath10 mpc within a projected distance of 1 @xmath10 mpc , as measured in real space .",
    "the mean infall velocity , @xmath88 , is 160 km s@xmath22 at the same scale . to determine @xmath11 in the redshift space catalog , we construct models of @xmath89 by convolving the measured @xmath90 in real space with different distribution functions of velocity differences for pairs of galaxies separated by vector distance @xmath91 to compare with the measured @xmath89",
    "let the vector @xmath91 separating two galaxies be decomposed into a transverse component @xmath65 and a line - of - sight component @xmath92 , where @xmath92 can be converted into a velocity separation at the given redshift .",
    "then the velocity difference is given as @xmath66-@xmath92 , and the convolution becomes @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "for the mean infall velocity , @xmath95 , we use the similiarity solution of @xcite , @xmath96 $ ] with @xmath97=5.83 h@xmath22 mpc . at @xmath17=1 in a lcdm model this corresponds to 71 km s@xmath22 .",
    "figure [ sigma12 ] plots the measured @xmath89 with models of @xmath11 equal to 350 , 400 , and 450 km s@xmath22 . using a minimum chi - squared test",
    ", we find that the best fit is @xmath11=410 km s@xmath22 with a 1@xmath19 error of 80 km s@xmath22 .",
    "if we instead use a mean infall velocity of @xmath95=160 km s@xmath22 at @xmath48=1 @xmath10 mpc , we find @xmath11=485 km s@xmath22 , consistent with the measured peculiar velocity dispersion in the mock catalog of 492 km / s .",
    "note that redshift space distortions are larger at high redshift than at low redshift by the factor @xmath98 , and that we have removed this extra factor in our modeling of @xmath11 by simply using 1+@xmath17=2 .",
    "the @xmath11 statistic is known to be unstable , however , as it is pair - weighted and therefore quite sensitive to rare , rich galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite also argue that the measured value of @xmath11 depends strongly on the assumed value of @xmath88 , the mean infall velocity , which here we have modeled in an adhoc manner .",
    "we therefore also measure the galaxy - weighted velocity dispersion @xmath12 , which is a more stable statistic and a measure of the one - dimensional peculiar velocity dispersion of galaxies relative to their neighbors .",
    "this statistic is more easily evaluated and does not rely on assumed values of the mean infall .",
    "following the prescription of baker , davis , and lin ( 2000 ) we construct the velocity distribution @xmath99 by a weighted sum over @xmath100 galaxies : @xmath101\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the weight for each galaxy , determined by the number of neighbors in excess of a random background . here",
    "@xmath103 is the distribution of neighboring galaxies within a cylinder of projected radius @xmath65 and half - length @xmath104 in redshift space , while @xmath105 is the background distribution expected for an unclustered galaxy distribution .",

    "this statistic results in an unbiased , object - weighted measure of the thermal energy of the galaxy distribution .",
    "the velocity distribution @xmath106 can be seen in figure [ sigma1 ] . to measure the intrinsic dispersion , @xmath12 , we model the real space correlation function @xmath8 convolved with an exponential velocity broadening function , @xmath107 ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "we measure @xmath12=180 + /20 km s@xmath22 for a @xmath108 @xmath10 mpc and @xmath1092500 km s@xmath22 .",
    "we find similar results for @xmath1102 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "the model fit for @xmath12=180 km s@xmath22 is shown in figure [ sigma1 ] .",
    "this value of @xmath12 should be compared to the 1-d rms peculiar motion of 315 km s@xmath22 for the gif mock galaxies in the catalog .",
    "this rms peculiar motion includes large scale flows , while @xmath12 measures only the nonlinear thermal component of the peculiar velocities .",
    "the difference is of the magnitude expected .",
    "note that @xcite measured @xmath111 km s@xmath22 for the lcrs survey , and it is quite likely that deep2 will report a value lower than this for the distant universe .",
    "this might become a modest mismatch between the gif simulations and reality .",
    "the highly non - gaussian nature of the galaxy distribution can be described with the hierarchy of @xmath112-point correlation functions . in particular",
    ", the three - point correlation function contains a wealth of information on gravitational collapse , initial conditions of the power spectrum , and most importantly , bias and galaxy formation . in this paper",
    "we present preliminary measurements of the three - point correlation function in our deep2 gif mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "our goal is to show that the three - point correlation function can be measured with sufficient accuracy to be interesting and that the our selection procedure does not systematically bias our results to a degree that would hinder proper interpretation .",
    "the three - point correlation function is defined as the reduced joint probability of finding a triplet of galaxy at a particular configuration @xcite .",
    "we have used the estimator by @xcite for extracting the three - point function : @xmath113 in this equation contributions to a triplet from the data and a random set are denoted with a @xmath114 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the above estimator is expected to be the most accurate edge - corrected formula in the family of estimators based on triplets .    for our measurements of the gif mock catalogs we chose eight logarithmic bins centered on 0.613 @xmath10 mpc to 10.779 @xmath10 mpc .",
    "all possible triangles with those sides ( allowed by the triangle inequality ) were used , i.e. 76 measurements were performed for each sample .",
    "the fast @xmath112-point correlation code by @xcite based on a novel double tree algorithm was used for the calculations .",
    "we have divided the gif mock galaxy catalogs into four redshift ranges @xmath17=0.70.9 , 0.91.1 , 1.11.3 , and 1.31.5 . for each redshift range , we used the six independent catalogs to enable a calculation of the cosmic ( co)variances . finally , for each simulation we calculated the three - point correlation function for all the galaxies in the catalog , as well as for only those galaxies which would be selected to be observed using our target selection slitmask algorithm .",
    "we used four times as many random points as galaxies for our measurements .",
    "figure [ 3pt ] contains the binned results for the shallowest slice , @xmath17=0.70.9 . for this preliminary investigation",
    "the results are interpreted in terms of the simple hierarchical assumption @xcite , @xmath115 the three - point function is plotted in terms of the hierarchical term on the right .",
    "if this equation were exact the result would be a straight line , as illustrated with a dotted line for the case @xmath116 .",
    "note that @xmath117 shows a weak scale dependence .",
    "according to figure [ 3pt ] , the hierarchical assumption gives a good qualitative description of the data .",
    "the tight relation illustrates the quality obtainable by the deep2 redshift survey .",
    "the scatter is due to measurement errors , cosmic variance , and an intrinsic shape dependence of the three - point correlation function with scale .",
    "the increasing error bars on large scales is inevitable because of cosmic variance . with a cross - scan size of 20 @xmath10 mpc , triangles with baselines",
    "@xmath11810 @xmath10 mpc will be poorly contrained by the deep2 survey .",
    "figure [ 3pt ] shows that the effect of the target selection bias is to decrease @xmath119 by @xmath020% .",
    "this , of course , will have to be carefully modelled in analyses of the real data .",
    "quantifying and separating the intrinsic shape dependence of the @xmath119 with scale is the key to determining bias from the three - point correlation function .",
    "analysis on quasilinear scales @xcite suggests that @xmath119 can be used for a determination of the galaxy bias that is independent from studies of kinematics or redshift - space distortions . in this way",
    "we will hopefully be able to measure absolute biases instead of relative biases .",
    "this is left for a subsequent paper ; here our purpose is mainly to illustrate the feasibility of a high accuracy three - point measurement with the deep2 redshift survey , and to show that the incompleteness caused by the slitmask algorithm does not cause significant , uncontrollable systematic errors .",
    "we expect to measure the evolution of @xmath18 as a function of redshift for the galaxies observed in the deep2 survey . as a simple test of the sensitivity of this measure",
    ", we use a counts - in - cells analysis to calculate @xmath18 in both our hubble volume and gif simulations mock galaxy catalogs in redshift bins of @xmath120=0.1 .",
    "the counts - in - cells method @xcite uses the moments of the counts of numbers of galaxies in spheres of a given size to quantify the amount of galaxy clustering present .    by counting objects in randomly - placed spherical cells ( @xmath121 ) of radius @xmath122",
    ", one can determine the moments of the counts : @xmath123 @xmath124 for each mock catalog , we created 40,000 spherical cells with radii of 8 mpc @xmath10 and randomly placed them throughout the catalog , ensuring that the centers of the cells were at least 8 @xmath10 mpc away from the boundary of the mock catalog . in this way none of the cells overlapped the catalog boundaries .",
    "we then divided the mock catalog into slices of @xmath120=0.1 bins ( eg .",
    "@xmath17=0.70.8 ) and calculated the moments of the galaxy counts and @xmath18 as a function of redshift .",
    "these moments are related to the volume - integrated two - point correlation function and @xmath18 as : @xmath125 @xmath126    we performed this analysis on both the hubble volume and gif mock catalogs , as each has an emphasis on different properties which will be relevant in our deep2 survey data .",
    "the gif mock catalogs do not have continuous evolution as they are made from three snapshot outputs at different redshifts stacked in @xmath17-space .",
    "however , we were able to use the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies to apply a realistic magnitude - limited selection function , and as a consequence the galaxies at high-@xmath17 are intrinsically more luminous than those at low-@xmath17 . since bias is expected to be luminosity - dependent , the _ inherent _ bias of the galaxies in the gif catalogs will change with redshift . the hubble volume catalogs , however , have realistic continuous evolution in their light - cone output , but the bias should change more slowly with redshift as the galaxy selection is the same at all redshifts .    to take into account the changing selection function with redshift , for the gif mock catalogs we created a volume - limited sample within each redshift bin .",
    "we used the absolute @xmath58-band magnitude to keep only those galaxies which are bright enough so that they could have been observed at the far end of the redshift bin . for the hubble volume mock catalogs we did not have magnitudes and so were not able to create volume - limited samples",
    "the hubble volume simulations therefore have a slight density gradient within each redshift bin .",
    "we tested the effects of this small density gradient on the counts - in - cells results from the gif mock catalogs with and without volume - limited samples and found a 1@xmath38 difference in the values of @xmath18 in the volume - limited sample , and therefore conclude that it is a negligible effect .",
    "the results for the hubble volume mock galaxy catalogs are shown in figure [ hubsigma8]a . the solid line is the mean @xmath18 as measured in our sixteen independent mock catalogs , while 1@xmath19 errors as determined from the variance between the different catalogs are shown in dashed lines . the expected linear evolution of @xmath18 in the underlying dark matter is shown as a dash - dot line ( normalized to 0.9 at @xmath17=0 , as were the simulations ; see fry 1996 for analytic formula ) .",
    "if we fit our estimates of @xmath127 of the galaxies to the analytical form @xmath128 we find a=0.64 ( 1@xmath19=0.01 ) and @xmath129=0.51 ( 0.10 ) .",
    "the covariance between a and @xmath129 is low ; the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are equal to -0.36 .",
    "an evolution of the bias between the galaxies and the dark matter is apparent in the shallower slope of the galaxy clustering evolution compared to the dark matter linear evolution prediction .",
    "figure [ hubsigma8]b is a plot of the estimated bias , equal to @xmath18(galaxies)/@xmath18(dark matter ) . the bias is slightly larger at high-@xmath17 , as is expected from hierarchical structure formation models .",
    "an analytic fit to the slope of the bias evolution results in a best fit of a=1.16 ( 1@xmath19=0.01 ) and @xmath129=0.37 ( 0.10 ) , with the same low covariance as the @xmath18 analysis .",
    "evolution of bias is therefore expected to be present at the 4@xmath19 level within a single slice of the deep2 survey , but separation of the changing bias from the evolving matter distribution will be complex . for a given cosmological model",
    ", we can use linear theory to calculate the latter quantity .",
    "the evolution of @xmath18 for the gif mock catalogs is shown in figure [ gifsigma8 ] .",
    "the best fit to the analytic form for the evolution of @xmath18 is a=0.80 ( 0.01 ) and @xmath129=0.38 ( 0.13 ) .",
    "the change of bias with redshift is best fit by a=1.45 ( 0.01 ) and @xmath129=1.26 ( 0.13 ) .",
    "here we are using mock galaxies of all luminosities , so that the bias changes with redshift not primarily because of evolution but because at high-@xmath17 we measure only the intrinsically more luminous galaxies in our magnitude - limited sample , and these objects are more clustered at all redshifts .",
    "this is an effect we will see in the deep2 survey , where we will have to subdivide the galaxies by linewidths or luminosity to separate the effects of bias evolution from differing bias in different galaxy populations .    in figure [ lf ]",
    "we show the b - band luminosity function ( lf ) of one gif mock catalog in different redshift bins . at lower redshifts",
    ", the lf extends to galaxies with absolute b mag of -19 , but at higher redshifts only the brightest galaxies are seen .",
    "this change of the lf with redshift is primarily due to our apparent magnitude sample selection , though there is some inherent evolution in the lf which is included in the gif simulations .",
    "we made subsamples of the galaxy catalogs based on absolute b - band magnitude and show the bias evolution for different magnitude ranges in figure [ bias ] .",
    "there is a clear trend between galaxy magnitude and the amplitude as well as evolution of bias .",
    "the brighter galaxies have a higher bias as well as stronger evolution .",
    "the values of the amplitude of the bias at @xmath17=1 ( a ) and the slope of the evolution ( @xmath129 ) are given in the figure , with 1@xmath19 errors in parentheses .",
    "we are able to measure relative bias between galaxy types to within 0.02 and measure evolution of bias at the 5 - 6@xmath19 level for the brightest galaxies ( 24@xmath130b mag@xmath13021 ) and at the 3 - 4@xmath19 level for the fainter galaxies ( 21@xmath130b mag@xmath13019 ) .",
    "note that these values for the bias are calculated in redshift space .",
    "a key goal of the deep2 redshift survey of galaxies is to constrain the evolution of large - scale structure in the universe . in most cosmological models ,",
    "the galaxy distribution is expected to evolve measurably between @xmath34 and @xmath131 , and different types of galaxies are expected to evolve independently .",
    "the survey will hopefully be sufficiently robust to allow subdivision of the sample so as to separately constrain the evolving bias of distinct classes of galaxies . as indicated by the modest size of the error",
    "bars in the comparison of mock catalogs , clustering constraints derived from the deep2 survey are expected to have only modest cosmic variance .",
    "they will thus supersede the current contradictory constraints on the strength of high redshift galaxy clustering derived from the modest surveys undertaken to date .",
    "as shown in figure 4 , each slice of the deep2 survey should lead to a 10% estimate of the correlation length of clustering @xmath97 .",
    "subdivision into differing samples will not degrade the measurement precision as rapidly as @xmath132 , because cosmic variance is dominant in this estimate , not poisson noise .",
    "the tests described above demonstrate the power of the deep2 survey for refined estimates of redshift space distortions in the distant universe .",
    "the high resolution of the deimos spectra will yield high quality redshifts , thus enabling the study of the kinematics internal to the galaxies and the kinematics of small scale clustering at @xmath131 .",
    "it should be readily possible to measure all these quantities within the survey volume , although the estimated @xmath11 is likely to be too noisy to set useful constraints .",
    "we note that @xmath12 is measureable to 10% precision , while @xmath11 , after averaging over all 6 mock slices , is measurable to only 20% precision . the kaiser infall effect on large scales",
    "should yield a 10% measurement of @xmath16 , when averaging over the full survey .",
    "estimates of the infall from subsamples of the deep2 survey will not degrade as rapidly as the poisson noise , since this statistic is also dominated by cosmic variance .",
    "precise constraints on the evolution of galaxy correlations will not only greatly improve our understanding of galaxy formation in hierarchical models , they will also facilitate novel cosmological tests of considerable interest . for example , the counting of galaxies in the classic @xmath133 test ( newman & davis , 2000 ; 2001 ) is capable of setting good constraints on cosmological parameters such as @xmath134 versus @xmath49 , but serious degeneracy will remain even after counting @xmath135 galaxies in the range @xmath136 . the magnitude - redshift relation derived from distant supernovae leads to constraints with very similar degeneracy between @xmath137 and @xmath49 . to a considerable degree",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by additional , complementary tests .",
    "for example , the expected ratio of the @xmath138 integral of @xmath8 at @xmath131 compared to that at @xmath34 has a different dependency on these same cosmological parameters , leading to contours of constant @xmath138 ratio that cross those of the @xmath133 test .",
    "further tests , such as the abundance of clusters of galaxies , lead to quite different constraints in this same parameter space plane ( newman et al .",
    "simultaneous execution of all these tests with the deep2 survey data is thus capable of setting rather tight constraints on @xmath137 and @xmath49 .",
    "the clustering of galaxies at high redshift is intimately connected to our incomplete understanding of galaxy formation , and both disciplines will advance as we analyze the details of clustering in the soon - to - begin deep2 survey . in order to study the precision with which one can expect to measure the clustering of galaxies at @xmath139 , we have generated a series of mock catalogs of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey .",
    "the mock catalogs are derived from two separate virgo simulations , one with continuous evolution of the underlying structure but inadequate mass resolution , and another with adequate mass resolution but which required the stacking of numerous simulation volumes to achieve a size sufficient to match the redshift range of the survey .",
    "the deep2 survey will use multislits , rather than multifibers , to multiplex spectroscopic targets .",
    "the necessity of avoiding overlapping spectra in the survey limits the sampling efficiency of spectroscopic target selection , especially in regions of the sky with higher than average surface density of galaxies . the tentative selection algorithm for the survey will lead to @xmath0 70@xmath38 success rate in target selection .",
    "although the resulting bias substantially affects the angular correlations of the selected targets , the correlations observed in redshift space are only modestly affected , and the bias can be largely removed by double counting galaxies closest on the sky and within the photometric redshift error to those galaxies not selected for spectroscopy .",
    "distortions in redshift space as measured by the @xmath15 diagram will be cleanly detected in the deep2 survey , and we expect to measure both the `` fingers of god '' on small scales and coherent infall motions of galaxies on large scales .",
    "additional tests of velocity field effects , such as the @xmath12 test of @xcite , will be readily possible with the sample and will be much less affected by the bias in the target selection algorithm .    we expect to be able to measure @xmath18 to within 10% in individual slices of the survey . assuming a cosmological model",
    ", we can detect the evolution of relative bias with 45@xmath19 significance within the volume of the deep2 survey itself , with more precise measurements for the brightest subsample of galaxies .",
    "the survey geometry is designed to allow a good measure of the three - point clustering amplitude for scales @xmath140 mpc , and tests of the mock catalogs indicate that this will indeed be possible .",
    "such a measure will allow an independent test of the bias in the galaxy distribution .",
    "the deep2 survey is designed to be a comprehensive study of the universe at @xmath131 .",
    "having a sample of high redshift galaxies comparable in quality to those available locally will enable many independent tests of the evolution of structure in the universe . with numerous cross checks and subdivision of the redshift catalogs into different classes of galaxies",
