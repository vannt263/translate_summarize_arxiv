    "effective , on - brane theories of gravity have been in vogue ever since the randall - sundrum warped braneworld scenario was proposed@xcite . among such four dimensional gravity theories , the most well - known one is due to shiromizu , maeda and sasaki ( sms ) @xcite which considers a bulk with an infinite extra - dimension and a single brane .",
    "there have been proposals on effective theories in a two - brane set - up . in this article",
    ", we consider one such effective theory due to kanno and soda ( ks ) @xcite .",
    "a major difference between the sms and the ks effective theories is the presence of a non - local ( bulk dependent ) term in the former and the absence of any non - locality in the latter .",
    "our objective is to look for solutions in the ks effective theory , keeping in mind that the radion field , which is linked to the distance between the branes , ( i ) is never zero in value ( thus , avoiding brane collisions ) and ( ii ) does not diverge at any finite value of the brane coordinates .",
    "recently @xcite , we have discussed some cosmological and spherically symmetric , static spacetimes in this four dimensional , effective , on - brane , scalar - tensor theory of gravity .",
    "the spherically symmetric , static solutions obtained in @xcite turned out to be the majumdar - papapetrou solution @xcite with the source being the effective scalar field ( radion ) energy - momentum and additional on - brane matter . here",
    ", we ask a broader question : are the standard general relativity ( gr ) solutions like the schwarzschild or the reissner ",
    "nordstrom ( rn ) permissible in the ks theory ? obviously , we do not expect the gr solutions to arise in the ks theory with the same matter content as in gr .",
    "rather , we would like to find out if the radion energy momentum and extra on - brane matter can conspire in unison to allow the schwarzschild or the rn solution in the ks effective theory .",
    "it should be noted that there are several aspects related to this question , a couple of which we have already mentioned .",
    "in addition to having a radion which is finite and non - zero everywhere , the on - brane matter must also be physically reasonable in the classical sense , i.e. it must satisfy one of the well - known energy conditions , such as the weak energy condition or the null energy condition @xcite",
    ".    we may recall that the reissner - nordstrom solution does arise as a solution @xcite of the shiromizu - maeda - sasaki ( sms ) single brane effective einstein equations @xcite , where the non - local contribution from the bulk weyl tensor ( the traceless @xmath0 ) acts as its source without any explicit on - brane matter .",
    "the functional form of the @xmath0 depends on the bulk weyl tensor and other features of the bulk geometry .",
    "it can not be determined uniquely from the knowledge of four dimensional , on - brane physics .",
    "in contrast , in the ks effective theory , the influence of the bulk is exclusively through the radion field which depends only on the brane coordinates .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to ask whether the equations which arise in the effective , on - brane kanno - soda theory ( which are local and different from those obtained in the single brane sms effective theory ) also admit a rn or a schwarzschild solution , in some way .",
    "we will mainly work with the reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution written in isotropic coordinates . after obtaining the radion profiles in the various cases",
    ", we will see if the radion satisfies the necessary requirements .",
    "subsequently , we will analyse the nature of required on - brane matter with reference to the weak energy condition @xcite .",
    "the effective on - brane scalar - tensor theories developed by kanno and soda @xcite in the context of the randall  sundrum two - brane model leads to the following einstein - like equations on the visible ` b ' brane @xcite , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the on - brane metric , the covariant differentiation is defined with respect to @xmath2 and we have taken the five dimensional line element as , @xmath3 @xmath4 is the @xmath5 gravitational coupling constant .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 are the stress - energy on the planck brane and the visible brane respectively .",
    "the appearance of @xmath8 ( matter energy momentum on the ` a ' brane ) in the field equations on the ` b ' brane , inspired the usage of the term ` quasi - scalar - tensor theory ' .",
    "however , if we assume @xmath9 then we have the usual scalar - tensor theory .",
    "we denote @xmath10 as the proper distance between branes located at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath10 is defined as , d(x)= ^l_0e^(x ) dy we further define @xmath13 .",
    "it may be observed that the viability of such a model with a everywhere finite and non - zero brane separation , implies that ( i ) the minimum of @xmath10 is not equal to zero and ( ii ) @xmath10 is never infinity at any finite value of the brane coordinates .",
    "this , in turn indicates that the value of @xmath14 is always greater than zero and @xmath14 never becomes infinity .    note that the radion contribution on the r. h. s. of the field equation is traceless , which is reminiscent of the traceless @xmath0 in the sms effective theory .",
    "the scalar field equation of motion on the visible brane is given as , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the traces of energy momentum tensors on planck ( ` a ' ) and visible ( ` b ' ) branes , respectively .",
    "the coupling function @xmath18 expressed in terms of @xmath19 is , @xmath20 we know that gravity on both the branes are not independent .",
    "dynamics on the planck brane at @xmath11 is linked to that on the visible brane through the relation @xcite : ( x)= where @xmath21 is the radion field as defined on planck brane .",
    "the induced metric on the visible brane can be expressed in terms of @xmath21 as , g^b - brane_=(1 - ) [ h _ + g^(1)_(h _ , , t^a_,t^b_,y = l ) ] where @xmath22 is the first order correction term ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is possible to work with the gravity theory and the @xmath21 field equation on the ` a ' brane .    in our work here , we assume that the on - brane stress energy is nonzero only on the ` b ' brane ( visible brane ) .",
    "we also assume that the on - brane matter is traceless and therefore , since the effective radion stress energy is also traceless , the ricci scalar of the spacetime geometry is identically zero .",
    "conversely , if we assume @xmath23 , the on - brane matter is traceless .",
    "this choice of @xmath23 enables us to propose the standard general relativity solutions ( like schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom ) as solutions in the kanno - soda effective theory with on - brane matter .",
    "the two main hurdles we need to address are therefore :    @xmath24 are the standard gr solutions also solutions in the effective theory , with a non - zero , everywhere finite radion",
    "?    @xmath24 what is the nature of the on - brane matter required to support such standard gr solutions ?",
    "let us assume a four dimensional line element on the visible brane , in isotropic coordinates , given as @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the unknown functions to be determined from the einstein - like equations . using the above line element ansatz and the assumption that @xmath19 is a function of @xmath28 alone , we get the following field equations from the einstein field equations mentioned above .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 correspond to on - brane matter and using the tracelessness condition we have @xmath33 .",
    "we have absorbed a factor of @xmath34 in the definitions of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , the scalar ( @xmath19 ) field equation gives @xmath35 which can be integrated once to get @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a positive , non - zero constant .",
    "it is useful to note here that the radion depends only on the metric function @xmath27 and not on @xmath26 .",
    "we also know that the existence of a horizon in a static , spherically symmetric geometry is linked with the existence of zeros in @xmath27 .",
    "thus , @xmath38 will always diverge at the horizon of any spherically symmetric , static spacetime .",
    "the field equations with the requirement of traceless on - brane matter , leads to the following equation for the metric function @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 a solution for @xmath39 and @xmath40 which satisfies the above tracelessness condition can be found by recalling the reissner ",
    "nordstrom solution written in isotropic coordinates .",
    "for such a solution we have , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants .",
    "we have retained the notation of ` @xmath45 ' and ` @xmath46 ' used in the standard gr reissner - nordstrom solution where they represent charge and mass , respectively .",
    "however , here , ` @xmath45 ' and ` @xmath46 ' may not carry the same physical meaning as in reissner - nordstrom .",
    "it is easy to check that the above - written functional forms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfy the tracelessness criterion .",
    "we now look at the equation for the scalar @xmath19 .",
    "assume @xmath47 .",
    "the first integral of the scalar wave equation then becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath37 , an integration constant .",
    "it is clear that there will be two different solutions for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "both these solutions must converge to the solution for @xmath54 which gives the extremal limit .",
    "when @xmath51 ( i.e. the nakedly singular solution ) we obtain @xmath55 this solution remains valid for all @xmath56 with a choice of @xmath57 necessary to ensure the positivity condition @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , note that the radion is finite everywhere including the asymptotic region @xmath59 . in the limit @xmath60 , this solution for @xmath19 will reduce to that for the extremal case , given as @xmath61 here @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a requirement for positivity of the brane separation .",
    "figure 1 shows the cases with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( blue curve ) and @xmath67 ( red curve ) .",
    "it may be noted from the figure that for @xmath67 the radion ends up having zeros and is therefore such a choice of @xmath68 is not permitted .     vs. @xmath28 for @xmath52 ;",
    "@xmath69     vs. @xmath28 for @xmath52 ; @xmath69    when @xmath53 ( i.e. the black hole solution with horizon at @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , we obtain @xmath72 this solution is valid for all @xmath73 . it may be observed that at the location of the horizon , the inter - brane distance becomes infinitely large ( see figure 2 ) . as shown later , this divergence implies a divergent matter stress energy at the horizon , thereby making the solution physically disallowed .",
    "note also that for @xmath66 the radion has zeros and therefore such a choice of the parameters is not permissible . in the limit @xmath60 ( from the @xmath52 side )",
    "limit , the above solution does approach the one mentioned above for @xmath74 .",
    "vs. @xmath28 for schwarzschild ; @xmath75    finally , let us obtain the radion for the schwarzschild case , i.e. when @xmath76 .",
    "this turns out to be : @xmath77 one can easily show from the above expression that on the horizon at @xmath78 , @xmath19 diverges making the solution again physically unacceptable .",
    "we illustrate this behaviour of radion profile in figure 3 .",
    "we note that apart from the divergence of the radion at the horizon , the radion profile hits @xmath79 at locations outside the horizon .",
    "this is a generic feature .",
    "coupled with the radion divergence at the horizon , one is forced to conclude that a physically allowed radion is not possible in a schwarzschild spacetime .      using the expressions of @xmath40 , @xmath19 and @xmath39 mentioned in the previous subsection , in eqns .",
    "( 9)-(11 ) we obtain non - zero @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , i.e. we have non - trivial on - brane matter .",
    "it is now necessary to see if the matter is reasonable in terms of satisfying the energy conditions @xcite and whether the @xmath60 limit yields our earlier result @xcite .    from the field equations we obtain ,    @xmath80    where we have used @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a proportionality constant .",
    "the pressure @xmath32 can be obtained from the tracelessness condition .",
    "it is given as , @xmath83 recall that @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 constitutes the weak energy condition ( wec ) and the subset @xmath87 , @xmath88 defines the null energy condition ( nec ) ) @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the energy conditions will help us know about the nature of the traceless matter that must be there on the brane , if the solution has to exist .",
    "it is useful to write down the expressions for @xmath89 and @xmath90 in a compact form .",
    "they are given as : @xmath91 \\\\ \\frac{\\kappa^2}{\\ell } \\left ( \\rho+p\\right ) = \\frac{1}{r^4 } \\left [ \\frac{2\\phi e^2}{u^2 } + \\frac{\\phi'}{2u f}\\left \\{r^3(u^2 - 3f^2)- r a^2\\right \\}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now analyse the various cases separately .    * case 1 ( @xmath92 ) : * in figs .",
    "4,5,6 we have chosen @xmath93 ( naked singularity ar @xmath94 ) so that @xmath95 .",
    "we also choose @xmath96 which means that the @xmath46 in the metric functions is the same as the @xmath37 in the radion field solution .",
    "the plot of @xmath30 vs. @xmath28 ( figure 4 ) demonstrates that @xmath30 is indeed positive over the entire domain of @xmath28 .",
    "also , from the expression for @xmath30 , it is clear that the dominant term which varies as @xmath97 as @xmath98 has a positive coefficient .",
    "however , the @xmath87 inequality is violated in a finite region around @xmath94 ( figure 5 ) . in the same way",
    ", we note that the @xmath99 inequality is violated for large @xmath28 , a fact which we demonstrate in figure 6 . in fig .",
    "6 , the @xmath100-axis is scaled by a factor of @xmath101 and we plot from @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "the negativity of @xmath90 at large values of @xmath28 , is evident from this figure .",
    "thus the on - brane matter must necessarily violate the wec if the naked singularity is a viable solution .    , @xmath96 , @xmath104 vs. @xmath28 .",
    "]    , @xmath96 , @xmath104 vs. @xmath28 . ]    , @xmath96 , @xmath104 vs. @xmath28 . ]    to see this more explicitly let us go back to the compact expression for @xmath89 quoted in ( 25 ) , with @xmath96 . here , note that the second term is positive but the positivity of the first term depends crucially on the sign of @xmath38 as well as the value of @xmath28 .",
    "now , we can have a solution @xmath19 ( for @xmath105 ) , with an always positive @xmath38 ( see figure 1 , blue curve ) which , in turn will ensure the positivity of the brane separation . further , note that in this case , @xmath39 is never zero .",
    "hence the @xmath87 inequality is never violated as long as @xmath106 .",
    "for @xmath107 there is a violation .",
    "the value of @xmath108 is determined by the @xmath28 for which the term in square brackets in ( 25 ) turns negative .",
    "@xmath109 , as seen in figure 5 .",
    "in general , the value of @xmath108 can be found from a solution of the transcendental equation : @xmath110 further , it is easy to see that near the naked singularity one can not avoid a violation of the wec by any choice of the parameters .",
    "let us evaluate the term in square brackets in ( 25 ) at @xmath111 ( the location of the naked singularity ) .",
    "one finds that @xmath112= \\frac{16}{m(\\nu-1)^3 } \\left [ 1-\\frac{c_4}{2}-\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\nu^2 - 1 } } \\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu-1}{\\nu+1}}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath113 .",
    "note , that earlier we found @xmath63 from the requirement of positive brane separation .",
    "thus the r. h. s. of ( 28 ) is always negative for any @xmath114 and @xmath63 .",
    "one can control the amount of violation by increasing @xmath46 ( since it appears in the denominator ) such that @xmath115 is negative .",
    "similarly , by adjusting @xmath68 , @xmath46 , @xmath45 one can control the extent of the region ( the value of @xmath108 where the wec will be violated ) .",
    "but there is no way to avoid the violation of the @xmath89 inequality though it may be less in value or confined to a small region .    in a similar manner",
    ", the @xmath90 inequality must necessarily be violated for large @xmath28 .",
    "the large @xmath28 limit of the @xmath90 expression clearly shows this feature .",
    "we have demonstrated this violation of the @xmath90 wec inequality in figure 6 .",
    "* case 2 ( @xmath116 ) : * in contrast , if we choose @xmath117 ( i.e. @xmath118 ) , the eqn .",
    "( 29 ) becomes @xmath112= \\frac{16\\alpha}{m(\\nu-1)^3 } \\left [ \\alpha-\\frac{c_4}{2}-\\frac{2\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\nu^2 - 1 } } \\tan^{-1}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu-1}{\\nu+1}}\\right]\\ ] ] here , with appropriate choices of @xmath82 , @xmath68 and @xmath119 one can satisfy the @xmath30 , @xmath89 inequalities over the required domain , i.e. from @xmath111 to infinity .",
    "for example , with @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath66 we find that in the domain @xmath123 there is no violation of the @xmath30 , @xmath89 inequalities ( the naked singularity is at @xmath124 ) .",
    "this is shown in figures 7,8 . however , the @xmath90 inequality still remains violated at large @xmath28 , a fact we show in figure 9 .    by tuning @xmath82 , @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath119 one can move around and reduce the extent of wec violation though it can not be avoided completely for the @xmath90 inequality .",
    "thus , for a naked singularity , wec violation of on - brane matter is necessary and this conforms with the cosmic censorship hypothesis @xcite .    , @xmath122 , @xmath125 vs. @xmath28 .",
    "]    , @xmath122 , @xmath125 vs. @xmath28 . ]    , @xmath122 , @xmath125 vs. @xmath28 . ]",
    "recall that when @xmath126 , the @xmath19 diverges at the black hole horizon @xmath70 which makes the rn black hole solution unphysical .",
    "the divergence of @xmath19 also implies a divergence of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as is evident from ( 22),(23 ) .",
    "thus , we do not discuss this case any further here .    in our earlier paper",
    ", we had noted that the extremal limit solution also does require on - brane matter which violates the energy condition inequality @xmath85 .",
    "here we have seen that this violation persists for all @xmath127 .",
    "in this article , we have discussed the viability of the various well known gr solutions like schwarzschild and reissner  nordstrom in the context of the ks theory of gravity . the crucial element in this work",
    "is related to finding a stable radion which is finite and non - zero everywhere .",
    "the rn black hole solution requires an infinite inter - brane distance at the horizon  a fact which makes it unphysical . on the other hand ,",
    "the schwarzschild solution requires a radion which diverges at the horizon , vanishes at two values of @xmath28 outside the horizon and is negative between these values . the rn naked singularity and the extremal rn solution do have a non - zero and finite radion , but our analysis shows that the required on - brane matter violates the weak and the null energy condition . for the naked singularity",
    ", this feature conforms with the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "a possible way out of the problems mentioned here is to look for solutions which are non - singular in nature and see if the radion is finite and non - zero everywhere and the on - brane matter satisfies the energy conditions .",
    "the finiteness of the radion seems to be in conflict with the existence of a black hole horizon .",
    "does this mean that there are no eternal black hole solutions in this theory ?",
    "we have not proved any such statement but the analysis on the rn and schwarzschild solutions seem to suggest such an outcome .",
    "finally , it may be useful to assume a specific form of the on - brane matter ( on either or both branes ) , and then find the radion and the metric functions .",
    "this will genuinely be like _ finding an exact solution _ , given the matter content on the branes .",
    "however , knowing the complicated nature of the field equations , this will not be easy to do .",
    "further , if we remove the traceless requirement , the equations will become even more difficult to solve .",
    "one might view the ks theory as a scalar - tensor theory in its own right .",
    "then , of course , the radion is just another scalar field without any reference to braneworlds and it need not satisfy the requirements we have mentioned in this paper .",
    "however , such an approach is not the main motivation of this article where we have chosen to view the radion as related to the proper distance between branes located in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime .",
