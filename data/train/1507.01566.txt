    "following the ejection of half or more of their mass via isotropic , slowy expanding winds , agb stars evolve into planetary nebulae ( pne ) , which , surprisingly show a diverse range of aspherical ( e.g. , bipolar and multipolar ) morphologies ( e.g. , sahai & trauger 1998 , sahai , morris & villar 2011a ) . studies of pre - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) , objects in transition between the agb and planetary nebula ( pn ) evolutionary phases , are critical for characterising the physical processes responsible for this dramatic transformation . sahai & trauger ( 1998 ) proposed that fast collimated outflows or jets , operating during the ppn and/or very late agb phase , are the primary agents for the dramatic change in the mass - loss geometry and dynamics during the agb - to - pn evolutionary phase .",
    "however , the physical mechanism for producing these fast outflows remains a mystery .",
    "high - angular - resolution interferometric ( sub)millimeter - wave observations are the best way to quantitatively probe the fast outflow s dynamics and energetics  crucial information for theoretical models ( e.g. , akashi & soker 2013 ) , and detailed numerical hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , lee & sahai 2003 , balick et al . 2013 ) , for pn shaping .",
    "such observations have resulted in the discovery of a handful of  extreme - outflow \" ppns  objects in which the molecular outflows reach speeds in excess of @xmath0100 , e.g. , boomerang nebula ( sahai et al . 2013 ) , iras22036 + 5306 ( sahai et al .",

    "the ( spatially ) integrated sma co j=21 line profile ( using a @xmath14 diameter circular aperture ) shows a very broad profile ( fig.[cosmt ] ) covering a total velocity extent of about 350 , i.e. , from @xmath15 .",
    "the smt co j=21 line profile ( fig.[cosmt ] ) is similar to the sma one ( a narrow emission feature at @xmath16due to the presence of an unrelated line - of - sight interstellar cloud , has been removed from the profile by interpolation ) .",
    "a gaussian fit to the profile gives a central velocity @xmath17 , and a fwhm of 196 .",

    "these results imply the presence of a fast , bipolar outflow with a ( roughly ) linear velocity - gradient , directed along the nebular symmetry axis , and a linear extent of @xmath27 .",
    "since agb mass - loss is typically spherical , with outflow velocities of 1015 , we conclude that the outflow observed in co j=21 emission is a fast , collimated post - agb outflow , typical of the ppn evolutionary phase .",
    "we made similar plots from the sma data cubes for co j=32 ( fig.[blured]b ) and sio j=54 ( not shown ) , dividing the emission velocity - range into two halves only ( blue : @xmath28 , red : @xmath29 ) due to the lower s / n in these lines , and found that these show a separation of @xmath30 roughly along the nebular axis .",
    "this separation is equal to that derived from our co j=21 data for the same red and blue outflow - velocity ranges , implying that the sio outflow s linear extent is likely comparable to that of co.    we also detected the co j=43 , j=32 and @xmath2co j=21 as well as the sio ( v=0 ) j=54 and 65 lines with the smt , but with lower s / n ( fig.[cosmt ] ) .",
    "we have compared the total co j=21 line fluxes from our sma and smt data , as these have the highest s / n , and find that these are consistent within 15% , i.e. , within typical calibration uncertainties )  we conclude that the sma data do not suffer from any significant flux losses .    continuum images were obtained after removing spectral regions containing line emission , using the miriad task uvlin . no continuum emission was detected from i08005 . using line - free channels , we find a @xmath31 noise of 1.05 ( 1.2 ) mjy / beam in the usb ( lsb ) at 1.3 mm and 11 ( 18 ) mjy / beam in the usb ( lsb ) at 0.87 mm .",
    "we now determine the physical properties of the high - velocity bipolar outflow ( e.g. , scalar momentum , mass , and age ) from an analysis of the molecular - line data .",
    "the observed ratios of the co j=21 , 32 and j=43 fluxes ( in k ) are @xmath32 , which imply corresponding non - beam diluted flux ratios of @xmath33 , since the source is unresolved by the smt beams of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 in these lines .",
    "we first make a simple emission model assuming a spherical outflow at a uniform excitation temperature equal to the kinetic temperature , @xmath37 , and carry out a least - squares fit to the line fluxes , varying @xmath37 , the outer radius ( @xmath38 ) , and mass of the emitting region ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we find @xmath40 and @xmath41k .",

    "2007 ) shows that the j=43 excitation temperature , @xmath42 , is lower than @xmath37 by about ( 2025)% due to the relatively low co line optical depths in our model ( @xmath43 ) and the average density , @xmath44@xmath45 , implied by the emitting region s mass and volume .",
    "thus , the resulting , corrected model @xmath46 , too low to fit the data .    using radex",
    ", we find that the average density required to bring @xmath42 closer to @xmath37 in order to fit the observed source brightness temperature ratios , is @xmath47@xmath45 ; the required @xmath48k , giving a source size of @xmath49 , comparable to the co source - size estimated from the sma data .",
    "the model source size is similar to the size derived from the hst image , implying that the co emission likely comes from the dense walls of the bipolar lobes seen in scattered light .",
    "the co column density is , @xmath50@xmath51 ( and the j=21 , 32 , and 43 lines have optical depths of 0.48 , 0.44 , 0.20 ) . assuming that the average emitting column is equal to the source radius , we find a co - to - h@xmath52 abundance ratio of , @xmath53 , in reasonable agreement with the value typically assumed for ppns , @xmath54 ( e.g. , bujarrabal et al .",

    "the above values of @xmath39 and f(@xmath1c/@xmath2c ) are lower limits since this is our  minimum - mass \" model  models with higher values of @xmath56 are allowed .",
    "however , the total mass increases more slowly than the average density , since in models with higher values of @xmath56 , the emitting region s size is smaller . for example , if we use the dust mass , @xmath57=0.0019@xmath58 derived by obs05 from a detailed 2d radiative transfer model of i08005 s sed , scale it to d=3kpc , and adopt a typical gas - to - dust ratio for oxygen - rich agb stars , @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 . for this value of @xmath39 , we need a co model with @xmath61@xmath45 , a factor @xmath62 higher than in our minimum - mass model ; @xmath63k , and @xmath64@xmath51 . since the co j=21 optical depth is higher ( @xmath65 ) , the abundance ratio is higher , f(@xmath1c/@xmath2c)=17 .",
    "we calculate the scalar momentum using the formulation described in bujarrabal et al .",

    "2001 ) . this outflow can not be driven by radiation pressure because the lobes dynamical ( expansion ) time - scale , @xmath74yr ( from dividing the model co shell - size by the co j=2 - 1 fwhm line - width ) is much smaller than that required by radiation pressure to accelerate the observed bipolar outflow to its current speed , @xmath75 yr , given i08005 s luminosity of @xmath76  at d=3kpc ( using the value derived by obs05 , @xmath77 . ) the mass - loss rate in the outflow is @xmath78 .",
    "the observed smt sio j=65 to 54 line flux ratio is @xmath79 ( with about @xmath80% uncertainty ) , implying an intrinsic flux ratio ( i.e. , corrected for beam - dilution ) of @xmath81 , since the source is unresolved by the smt beams of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in these lines . using radex",
    ", we find that for @xmath84k , the average @xmath85 density in the sio emission region is , @xmath86@xmath45 in order to fit the observed value of @xmath87 .",
    "the fractional sio abundance is @xmath88 , close to the maximum value assuming cosmic abundances ( @xmath89 ) , and comparable to the observed maximum circumstellar sio abundance in oxygen - rich agb stars ( @xmath90 : sahai & bieging 1993 ) .",
    "if the sio emission comes from shocked gas at a higher kinetic temperature than that for co , the minimum density required is higher .",
    "evidence of very fast outflows in i08005 comes from three independent probes : ( i ) co data ( presented here ) , ( ii ) h@xmath5 spectrum in scetal08 , and ( iii ) oh maser emission ( vla mapping ) reported in zijlstra et al .",
    "the oh maser features cover the velocity range of @xmath91 , i.e. , roughly the range covered by red half of the co j=21 profile .",
    "in contrast to oh and co emission , the h@xmath5 absorption probes atomic gas .",
    "since the h@xmath5 absorption feature is not spatially resolved in the ground - based long - slit spectra , it is difficult to directly establish its relationship to the fast molecular outflow , however the close agreement between the terminal outflow velocities derived for these indicates that they are closely associated .",
    "the atomic gas may be located inside the lobes and may constitute unshocked material of an underlying jet , and/or the interface between the latter and the lobe walls , as proposed for iras22036 + 5306 ( scetal06 ) .",
    "the jet - like feature seen in the hst image ( fig.[i08005hst],inset ) may represent the precessing jet s signature close to its launch - site .",
    "the high - speed bipolar outflow in i08005 may be driven by an accretion disk .",
    "bakker et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find numerous narrow , double - peaked , chromospheric emission lines from neutral and singly ionized metals , and propose that these might arise in an accretion disk .",
    "we conjecture that the broad h@xmath5 wings seen towards this object might arise as a result of raman - scattering of ly@xmath6 emission generated by such a disk  a process that produces an h@xmath5 profile with a width that is a factor 6.4 larger than the ly@xmath6 width and a @xmath92 wing profile .",
    "the very wide ( @xmath93 ) h@xmath5 line wings in i08005 show this shape , furthermore a weak emission feature around 6830  with @xmath94 , corresponding to raman - scattering of the 1032  component of the ovi doublet at @xmath95 is also seen ( scetal08 ) ; the 7088  feature that corresponds to the 1038  component is a factor 4 weaker , and too weak to be visible .",
    "other line - broadening mechanisms include electron scattering and emission from a rotating disk .",
    "arrieta & torres - peimbert ( 2003 ) find that electron scattering requires extreme densities ( e.g. , @xmath96 @xmath45 in m2 - 9 ) making that an implausible mechanism .",
    "keplerian rotation in a disk around the central star is too low to directly account for the broad line - width in i08005 ( and ppne in general : sahai et al .",
    "2011b )  taking the radius for the central post - agb star of i08005 to be @xmath97  ( slijkhuis et al . 1991 ) and a nominal stellar mass of 1 , we find the maximum rotation speed is @xmath98 , too low for generating the extreme line - wings of the h@xmath5 profile , even with the factor 6.4 increase provided by raman - scattering .",
    "we therefore conclude that the accretion disk in i08005 must be around a much smaller star , e.g. , a main - sequence companion .",
    "the raman - scattering likely occurs in the innermost regions of the fast neutral wind seen via its blue - shifted absorption feature signature in the h@xmath5 profile . in this case , following sahai et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , we scale from the minimum scattering column density , @xmath99 @xmath51 needed to achieve the raman conversion efficiency necessary for producing the very broad observed line - widths ( see fig.1 of lee & hyung 2000 ) , to find that @xmath100(@xmath101au ) ( d/3kpc ) ( @xmath102/100 ) ( @xmath103@xmath51 ) , where @xmath104 is the radius of the neutral wind where the raman - scattering occurs .",
    "@xmath102 is set equal to @xmath105 of the broad co j=21 line profile , and similar to the neutral outflow s average outflow - velocity derived by scetal08 .",
    "the mass - loss rate requirement is easily met in i08005 since obs05 derive a mass - loss rate of @xmath106  for a collimated fast wind in the 24 - 780au region around the central star ,",
    "i08005 is very similar to other extreme - outflow oxygen - rich ppns , iras22036 + 5306 ( sahai et al .",
    "2006 ) and hd101584 ( olofsson et al . 2015 , sivarani et al . 1999 ) in the properties of its collimated fast outflow ( expansion - velocity , scalar - momentum , and kinetic - energy ) , and its h@xmath5 emission profile ( very broad wings , p - cygni absorption ) .",
    "but in striking contrast to these objects , it appears to lack mm and submm continuum emission from its central region ",
    "the ratio of its 1.3 mm to 60micron flux is @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , compared to @xmath109 and @xmath110 for hd101584 and iras22036 + 5306 , respectively .",
    "both ppns , as well as the  disk - prominent \" sub - class of young post - agb objects ( dpagb objects : sahai et al .",
    "2011c ) , which unlike ppns , show little or no extended nebulosity , and have central stars that are radial - velocity binaries ( e.g. , van winckel et al . 2008 ) , emit relatively strong mm / submm continuum emission from their central regions .",
    "this emission has been attributed to the presence of substantial masses of cool , mm - sized grains ( sahai et al .",
    "2011c , gielen et al .",
    "2007 , de ruyter et al . 2006 ) .",
    "their origin is not understood at present but is potentially a key probe of important mass - ejection processes occurring during the late - agb and post - agb evolutionary phases , especially those that lead to the formation of large dusty equatorial disks or torii .",
    "for example , in hd101584 , where a binary companion has been found from radial - velocity variations ( bakker et al .",
    "1997 ) , olofsson et al .",
    "( 2015 ) propose a scenarion in which both the formation of the central , equatorially - dense mass structure and the collimated outflow result from a common - envelope ( ce ) event  but the latter does not release enough energy to drive the mass - ejection , and another mechanism augments or even dominates it .",
    "the apparent lack of a substantial mass of material in the equatorial waist of i08005 suggests that perhaps it did not undergo a ce event , and its collimated outflow ( and collimated outflows in ppns generally ) may be launched differently , possibly from an accretion disk as we have suggested earlier .",
    "i08005 is thus a key post - agb object for further detailed study .",
    "for example , alma can be used to probe its compact central region , in order to search for weak mm / submm continuum emission that may be present but was below our sensitivity limit , and for the presence of gas ( and its kinematics ) associated with its dusty waist .",
