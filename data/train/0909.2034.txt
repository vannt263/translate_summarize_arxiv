    "dark matter is a big mystery . weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps )",
    "provide one interesting class of particles to serve as dark matter .",
    "there are , nevertheless , two main puzzles with typical wimp candidates :    * abundance is determined by thermal freezeout . while a thermal freezeout origin can yield the observed cosmological abundance",
    "when the annihilation cross section is tuned to roughly @xmath5 pb , this mechanism is entirely unrelated to the origin of matter , which arises from an asymmetry .",
    "the observational relation between the dark matter density and the baryonic density , @xmath6 , is a coincidence . * elementary wimps with electroweak interaction strength couplings to standard model ( sm ) fermions generically have very strong constraints from direct detection bounds . to be `` safe '' , wimp interactions with the sm must be sub - weak strength , and typically , their mass determined by a mechanism unrelated to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we propose a new model of dark matter that tackles both problems .",
    "the first problem can be addressed if the dark matter abundance is linked to the baryon abundance .",
    "this has been considered before , for example , in the context of technibaryon dark matter @xcite . in these models , electroweak sphalerons re - process baryon and lepton asymmetries into technibaryon asymmetry .",
    "the constituents are electroweak charged , while the technibaryon composite dark matter is neutral .",
    "the sphalerons generate a relation between the number densities of leptons , baryons and technibaryons , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represent the lepton , baryon and technibaryon asymmetries , and the exact proportions are @xmath11 depending on the electroweak charges of the technibaryon constituents .",
    "cosmologically @xmath12 , so that the relation eq .  (",
    "[ proportions ] ) implies the dark matter mass @xmath13  gev .",
    "if this were the end of the story , technibaryon dark matter ( or any other weak scale model which connects the dark matter to the baryon asymmetry , e.g.  @xcite ) would be ruled out .",
    "however , if the dark matter constituents are just becoming non - relativistic as the sphalerons are decoupling , there is an exponential boltzmann suppression in the technibaryon asymmetry relative to the lepton and baryon asymmetries , implying the dark matter can naturally have an electroweak scale mass .",
    "the other possible solution to the dark matter baryon coincidence places the gev scale dark matter in a hidden sector weakly coupled to the sm sector @xcite .    the second problem can , in fact , be ingeniously solved by compositeness . in technicolor theories , technifermions interact with the sm through renormalizable interactions , while a composite technibaryon dark matter candidate is charge- and electroweak - neutral .",
    "this eliminates renormalizable interactions with the sm below the electroweak scale , leaving only higher dimensional operators @xcite . in the early 1990s this was",
    "thought to be an unfortunate result ",
    "dark matter could not be observed in the - then foreseeable future .",
    "given the direct detection bounds today ( e.g.  @xcite ) , this becomes a `` feature '' of our composite dark matter model that we exploit to naturally suppress the direct detection cross sections .",
    "the residual electroweak - mediated direct detection cross section of composite dark matter arises from `` form factor '' suppression , somewhat analogous to the suppression of the photon coupling to neutrons at energies much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "for example , the leading order operators that couple scalar technibaryon dark matter to the sm arise at dimension-6 ( charge radius ) @xcite and dimension-7 ( chromomagnetic polarizability ) @xcite , suppressed by two or three powers of @xmath15 .",
    "what was not fully appreciated in the 1990s is that both of these operators can be eliminated .",
    "the charge radius vanishes in a limit in which the current masses of the constituents are equal .",
    "the chromomagnetic polarizability vanishes when the constituents do not carry ordinary qcd color . while this suggests rethinking technicolor dark matter",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , the model building difficulties of realizing a fully successful technicolor model incorporating flavor as well as avoiding electroweak precision constraints remains daunting .    in this paper",
    ", we take a different approach , in the spirit of the hidden valley @xcite and kang and luty s quirks @xcite .",
    "we retain the new strong dynamics , but discard their role in electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the new strong dynamics gets strong at a scale below the electroweak scale .",
    "we call the candidate that arises in this approach quirky dark matter ( qdm ) .",
    "the simplest quirky dark matter model , as we will describe , contains exactly the same gauge and matter content as that of minimal su(2 ) technicolor with two flavors .",
    "amusingly , what was originally a problem of minimal technicolor ",
    "namely the possibility that the vacuum aligned to an electroweak - preserving state @xcite  is now a `` feature '' here since we utilize the ordinary higgs mechanism to break electroweak symmetry .",
    "indeed , we do not want the strong dynamics to break electroweak symmetry ( even a little bit ) lest we run into electroweak precision constraints .    with an ordinary higgs present , quirks can obtain their mass through the higgs mechanism just like quarks and leptons .",
    "this has several implications : new contributions to the electroweak oblique corrections arise ; we estimate them below .",
    "quirky dark matter can interact with nuclei of direct detection experiments through higgs exchange ; this leads to an ordinary elastic scattering cross section that is right near the current bounds for a light higgs boson . finally , assuming the new strong force confines , new operators involving the higgs are present that can allow the new glueballs to decay , independent of the quirk mass .",
    "the model of quirky dark matter that we mainly wish to consider consists of two flavors of quirks transforming under a new strongly interacting sector , @xmath16 , that hereafter we call `` quirkcolor . ''",
    "variations of this , with different numbers of quirk flavors and quirkcolors are also possible ; we will remark on the possibility of more quirk flavors later in the paper .",
    "we assume that the quirkcolor coupling constant gets strong _ below _ the weak scale .",
    "the particle content and charges under the gauge and global symmetries are given in table  [ table : model ] in terms of two - component spinors .",
    ".particle content and charges under the gauge and global symmetries .",

    "since qdm contains additional matter that acquires mass exclusively through the higgs mechanism , there are new contributions to the electroweak precision parameters .",

    "eliminating the charge radius operator requires negligible splitting between the current masses of the quirks . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution to @xmath26 from this sector is negligible .",
    "the minimal model therefore has @xmath27 , which is roughly at the 95% cl contour when comparing against lep electroweak working group fits @xcite .",
    "suffice to say it is a straightforward ( but unenlightening ) exercise to slightly extend the model to give a additional contributions to @xmath26 ( and @xmath28 ) that result in a model fully consistent with electroweak precision data .    in the minimal model , with the only particles transforming under @xmath16 given by that in table  [ table : model ] , the quirkcolor group confines .",

    "the large current quirk masses ensure these composites are massive , forming `` quirkonia '' bound states with a spectrum similar to heavy quarkonia @xcite .",
    "we assume the quirkonia masses are sufficiently heavy to avoid lep ii bounds ( i.e. , quirks heavier than about 100 gev ) . existing tevatron bounds , as well as prospects for future detection at tevatron and lhc , will be studied in a future paper .",
    "confinement of @xmath16 leads to quirkcolor glueballs .",
    "these glueballs decay through higher dimensional operators into sm matter . depending on the scales ,",
    "however , their lifetime may be very long @xcite , potentially leading to cosmological problems depending on the quirk masses and the confinement scale . in qdm , there are additional operators due to interactions with the higgs .",
    "these interactions are written with an estimate of their contribution to the glueball width in sec .",
    "[ sec : glueballdecay ] .",
    "our quirkcolor group @xmath16 , however , does not necessarily need to confine , if additional ( massless ) flavors transforming only under @xmath16 are present .",
    "this provides an interesting possibility in which quirkcolor flows to a conformal field theory _ without _ confinement .",
    "we emphasize that , for much of our discussion below , essentially none of our calculations depend on the scale ( or existence ) of confinement , so long as it is sufficiently smaller than the inverse bohr radius of the bound states so that reliable non - relativistic calculations can be performed . to this end",
    ", we need the quirkcolor coupling , evaluated at the scale of the inverse bohr radius , to be perturbative .",
    "the situation is quite analogous to heavy quarkonia .",

    "<S> we propose a new dark matter candidate , `` quirky dark matter , '' that is a scalar baryonic bound state of a new non - abelian force that becomes strong below the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the bound state is made of chiral quirks : new fermions that transform under both the new strong force as well as in a chiral representation of the electroweak group , acquiring mass from the higgs mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> electric charge neutrality of the lightest baryon requires approximately degenerate quirk masses which also causes the charge radius of the bound state to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance is determined by an asymmetry that is linked to the baryon and lepton numbers of the universe through electroweak sphalerons . </S>",
    "<S> dark matter elastic scattering with nuclei proceeds through higgs exchange as well as an electromagnetic polarizability operator which is just now being tested in direct detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a novel method to search for quirky dark matter is to look for a gamma - ray `` dark line '' spectroscopic feature in galaxy clusters that result from the quirky lyman - alpha or quirky hyperfine transitions . </S>",
    "<S> colliders are expected to dominantly produce quirky mesons , not quirky baryons , consequently large missing energy is not the primary collider signal of the physics associated with quirky dark matter .    * </S>",
