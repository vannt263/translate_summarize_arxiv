    "in the recent years , the quantum entanglement and mixedness are two biggest challenges of quantum information theory .",
    "quantum entanglement is a very important quantum characteristic that has no classical counterpart . also , quantum entanglement is necessary for the realization of quantum communication and the most important computational tasks , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and so on .",
    "in addition , it is crucial to understand the fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics , including quantum measurement and quantum decoherence @xcite . consequently , no system can be completely isolated from its environment . thus in real experimental situations due to the coupling environment",
    ", the entangled state inevitably loses its purity and becomes mixed . + decoherence phenomenon is the most dangerous obstacle for all entanglement manipulations",
    ". however , the recent studies of decoherence effect for different systems are increased due to the variety of applications in areas as quantum optics and quantum information @xcite . in fact , the interactions between a quantum system with the environment are caused two types of irreversible effects , e.g. , quantum dissipation and quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "the former will cause energy dissipation , and the latter will make the system degenerate from coherent state to classical state .",
    "entanglement evolution under decoherence has attracted much interest and many researchers have studied it extensively based on various models in the view of environment - induced decoherence @xcite .",
    "+ in the previous years , some researchers have found that state entanglement can be decreased to zero abruptly and remained zero for a finite time .",
    "this phenomenon is called entanglement sudden death @xcite , where entanglement of two - qubit decays to zero in a finite time under the influence of pure vacuum noise @xcite .",
    "precisely , entanglement sudden death has been experimentally observed in an implementation using twin photons @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite . in many efforts",
    "have been devoted to study various types of superconducting ( sc ) qubit which is considered as good candidate to solve this problem .",
    "+ nowadays , superconductors are viable elements and feasible within current experimental technology .",
    "sc qubit is represented a unique and its interesting approach to quantum information and quantum computation because it naturally allow strong coupling .",
    "some aspects which are discussed through these systems : entanglement between a flux qubit and a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) @xcite have been realized experimentally .",
    "in addition , there are other aspects : the strong coupling of a single photon to a sc qubit has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite by using a one - dimensional transmission line resonator @xcite .",
    "recently , some quantum logic gates have proposed @xcite by using a system consisting of a number of sc - charge qubits coupled to a resonator to study different quantum operations . also , a new physical scheme for implementing a discrete quantum fourier transform is proposed via sc qubits coupled to a single - mode sc - cavity @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of environment can not be neglected in these situations @xcite , because , the qubits are never isolated , but under some environmental influence .",
    "+ our purpose of this article is to give an analysis of the entanglement dynamics of a sc phase qubit coupled to a torsional resonator .",
    "consequently , some phenomena , such as the qubit inversion , purity and negativity are theoretically investigated , mainly because such states are more physical and experimentally relevant .",
    "thus we take into account decoherence and analyze its effect on these phenomena . despite the complexity of the problem ,",
    "the analytical descriptions of the exact solution of the master equation is presented . +",
    "this article is arranged as follows : the physical system of qubit with torsional resonator and its dynamics is provided in section 2 .",
    "the influence of phase - damping on a sc qubit inversion and measures of entanglement is presented in section 3 .",
    "finally , the conclusions is demonstrated in section 4 .",
    "we introduce a theoretical description of the superconducting phase qubit coupled to a torsional resonator . a phase qubit with @xmath0 excess cooper - pair charges consists of two superconducting islands connected to a superconducting electrode through two identical josephson tunnel junctions of a small size with the same capacitance @xmath1 ,",
    "see fig.[w1 ] . if the phase qubit is working in a regime with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are josephson energy , charging energy , boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of the superconducting phase qubit can be described by the form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the phase difference across the junction , bias current , junction critical current , and the external flux which is generated by a classical applied magnetic field , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 and @xmath8 are quantum mechanical conjugate variables and satisfy @xmath12=-i$ ] .",
    "+ in this study , the bias current @xmath9 is assumed to be zero .",
    "the josephson energy , and the charging energy for each junction also are assumed to be @xmath13 and @xmath14 as estimated in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effective josephson coupling @xmath15 of phase qubit is controlled by the external flux @xmath11 .",
    "if the phase different @xmath8 is confined to the period @xmath16 , the states of a single qubit are restricted to a two lowest - energy states @xmath17 and @xmath18 .     and josephson capacitance @xmath1 is driven with a bias current @xmath9 .",
    "the rectangle in this diagram refer to dissipative part of the admittance of the bias current @xmath9.,width=529,height=377 ]    hence , the hamiltonian ( [ a ] ) can be converted to a spin representation as follows : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the frequency of the phase qubit , and @xmath21 is the usual pauli spin operator .",
    "+ the torsional resonator mode is described by a harmonic oscillator - like hamiltonian as follows @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular momentum conjugate to @xmath24 and @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the fluctuations of the angle @xmath24 can be described by the fluctuation @xmath26 in the ground state , where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the rotational moment of inertia of the torsional resonator , and vibration frequency , respectively .",
    "+ if we put the sc qubit in the torsional resonator , the effective flux is @xmath29 .",
    "hence , @xmath24 is measured relative to the direction of @xmath11 , @xmath3 is the largest energy scale and coupling between the qubit and torsional vibrational mode can be a large quantity .",
    "thus , we consider the qubit is coupled to resonator mode . also , the external magnetic field is parallely applied to the phase qubit plane .",
    "then the external field in this case is given by : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the angle at equilibrium measured from the direction of @xmath11 . in this work , @xmath32 is the maximum value of magnetic flux when the field is perpendicular to the qubit plane .",
    "if @xmath31 is non - zero , the coupling strength is decreased by factor @xmath33 , so consider the angle @xmath34 .",
    "however , one concludes that the total hamiltonian restricted to the two states is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 are the ( creation ) annihilation operators for the vibrational mode and phase qubit , respectively , @xmath40 is the constant coupling energy between the phase qubit and the torsional resonator , and @xmath41 is the torsional oscillator frequency . because of the negative sign of the second term , the above hamiltonian ( [ a1 ] ) in the counter - rotating wave approximation can be written as follows : @xmath42 + under the previous hypothesis , the non - unitary time evolution of present interaction system with taking into account the dissipative effect is given through the density operator .",
    "the density operator is described by a master equation of the form : @xmath43 + \\frac{\\hbar\\gamma}{2}\\big(\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{\\sigma}_{z}-\\hat{\\rho}\\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a positive parameter that represents a dispersive reservoir ( or phase damping of the qubit system ) .",
    "it is one of the variables that does not interchange energy with the qubit system .",
    "dispersive reservoir of the qubit may occur due to dephasing interactions that might arise .",
    "for instance , the dispersive reservoir may occur from the elastic collisions in a qubit vapor .",
    "the exact solution for eq.[a3 ] in the case of a high-@xmath45 torsional resonator ( @xmath46 ) is obtained by analytic method .",
    "the used analytic method is presented by the dressed - states representation @xcite .",
    "this representation is consisting of the complete set of hamiltonian eigenfunctions . here , the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 are corresponding to the higher energy and the lower energy , respectively . in the invariant subspace spanned by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian ( [ a2 ] ) are given by : @xmath49 with the abbreviations @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the detuning parameter which represents the difference between transition energy of qubit and torsional energy . + to obtain the analytical solution for eq.[a3 ] , we suppose that the qubit is initially in the general superposition of the excited state and ground state while the torsional resonator is assumed to be initially in a coherent state , that is @xmath55 consequently , the time - dependent analytical solution for the density matrix with the initial previous state is given by : @xmath56 where all elements of the density matrix ( [ a4 ] ) are also functions in @xmath57 .",

    "besides that , in the presence of the dispersive reservoir @xmath75 , we can not use the @xmath100 as a measure for entanglement but we use it as a measure to the amount of the coherence loss of the qubit state . at a weak dispersive reservoir , one can find the amplitudes of the oscillations of entropy diminish rapidly , and the local extreme of the purity at half - revival time for the mentioned measure are still apparent , where at this time the qubit and vibration mode are approximately disentangled . if @xmath113 , the amplitudes of the local extreme of the purity oscillations are more rapidly deteriorated .",
    "due to damping , the amplitude of the purity of qubit is suppressed .",
    "therefore , the qubit coherence loss may occur due to dephasing interactions of qubit with the vibration mode",
    ". however , the purity loses its coherence more than its gain due to dispersive reservoir , and finally completely loses coherence and fall into a statistically mixed state .",
    "+ as well as , we investigate in fig.[w3]b and fig.[w3]c , [ w3]d ) , the evolution of purity in off - resonance case with @xmath111 and @xmath82 for a different values of @xmath68 and @xmath83 . in the absence of @xmath65 , see fig.[w3]b , fig.[w3]c and fig.[w3]d , one can note that the detuning parameter affects the fluctuations in the temporal evolution for @xmath100 , and results in deterioration of the oscillations .",
    "one can also note from these figures , the local extreme for the mentioned measure are pronounced and still apparent in all curves .",
    "however , we see that the amplitudes of oscillations of purity are decreasing due to the increase of the value for @xmath83 in these different figures , that is the detuning parameter improves the influence of dispersive reservoir on this phenomenon . in addition , when @xmath75 , one can find from fig.[w3]b , fig.[w3]c and fig.[w3]d at a weak value of @xmath65 , that the local extreme for the mentioned measure is about to disappear .",
    "also , one can observe at the high values of @xmath65 , that the amplitudes of oscillations for all curves are deteriorated completely , and the purity is increased monotonically and no longer equal zero due to the influence of the dispersive reservoir .",
    "+ however , from fig.[w3]c for @xmath107 ( phenomenon of coherent trapping ) and @xmath108 , and from fig.[w3]d for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we note that the behavior for two curves of the purity in these cases of detuning is periodical , and note that the oscillations periods for two curves are apparent after a large period of time on the case in which @xmath106 .",
    "then , we conclude that the behavior of curves of purity is also periodical for the values more than @xmath110 for the different values of @xmath68 . finally , when @xmath114 , we get @xmath115 , then @xmath116 , which means that the asymptotic qubit state is a statistically mixed state , that is the mixedness of the phase qubit state is complete .      because of the existence of dispersive reservoir parameter in eq.[a4 ] , the purity can not be a measure for the entanglement .",
    "therefore , we use the negativity @xmath117 to measure the amount of the entanglement that can be expressed as @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a negative eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix of the vibrational mode - phase qubit . here , @xmath119 is computed by using numerical calculations . for an entangled mixed state",
    ", @xmath117 is positive . if @xmath120 , the states are separable .",
    "moreover , the negativity is used to estimate the amount of entanglement of the final state if we start with a pure or mixed state .",
    "+ the influence of dispersive reservoir of qubit on the negativity as a function of @xmath67 and a parameter @xmath121 in the resonance case when @xmath122 and @xmath82 is shown in fig.[w4]a and fig.[w4]b . from fig.[w4]a , in the absence of @xmath65 , we note that the local extremes of @xmath117 approximately are regularly distributed at small times @xmath123 with the different values of @xmath68 .",
    "after that , the values of minimum for @xmath117 are increased when the time increases . also , the time evolution curve of @xmath117 has a local extreme at the revival time @xmath124 .",
    "however , we note that , the value of @xmath117 is oscillated around its maxima for the different values of @xmath68 and @xmath125 .",
    "if we take into account the dispersive reservoir parameter , the amplitudes of the fast oscillations of the negativity measure diminish , and @xmath117 arrives to its minima ( maxima ) value at half - revival time .",
    "the negativity has a very strong sensitivity to @xmath65 parameter .",
    "therefore , when we take @xmath113 , see fig.[w4]b , the @xmath117 quite vanishes at particular times for the different values of @xmath68 . in this case , the dispersive reservoir at these particular times , the entanglement between the vibrational mode and qubit is completely destroyed .",

    ", the behavior of the negativity in off - resonance case with @xmath126 , @xmath82 and @xmath122 is displayed in fig.[w4]c and fig.[w4]d .",
    "one can find that , the detuning parameter @xmath127 affects the amplitudes of fluctuations in the evolution of @xmath117 either by increasing or by decreasing on the case in which @xmath85 for the different values of @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath126 , see fig.[w4]c , the amplitudes of oscillations of @xmath117 are less than their counterparts of the case @xmath85 . because of the detuning parameter , some of oscillations are deteriorated , the local extremes of the negativity are pronounced and still apparent in this surface .",
    "in addition , with @xmath75 , the oscillations of the local extreme of the @xmath117 are disappeared completely .",
    "when the dispersive reservoir is increased , say @xmath128 , see fig.[w4]d , the amplitude of most oscillations are suppressed and @xmath117 quite vanishes at particular times .",
    "this means that , after a particular time , the dispersive reservoir destroys the entanglement of the global total system state .",
    "therefore , one can determine a particular region in which there is no entanglement between the qubit and the torsional resonator due to the complete destruction of coherence in the presence of @xmath65 .",
    "in this article , the system of sc phase qubit coupled to a torsional resonator is governed by a master equation . an analytical solution for the master equation",
    "is obtained with the general initial state .",
    "several physical phenomena have been studied , such as qubit inversion , purity and negativity in the resonance and off - resonance cases for many different initial states .",
    "it is found that , the qubit inversion and purity , for the resonance and off - resonance cases , are quite sensitive to any change @xmath65 parameter . by using the negativity the amount of the entanglement",
    "is studied .",
    "the dispersive reservoir destroys the entanglement of the global vibrational mode - phase qubit state .",
    "in addition , we found that in off - resonance case , the detuning parameter improve the influence of the damping on qubit inversion , purity and negativity .",
