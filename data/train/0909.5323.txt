    "one of the important processes that will be studied at high precision at ilc with and without beam polarization is w - pair production .",
    "phenomelonogical studies of this process within the standard model ( sm ) have been carried out in great detail  @xcite .",
    "since properties of the weak gauge bosons are closely linked to electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the structure of the gauge sector in general , detailed study of w physics will throw light on what lies beyond the sm .",
    "the study of mechanisms of ewsb is one of the main concerns of particle physics today .",
    "the standard higgs mechanism is less than satisfactory , and faces difficulties such as the hierarchy problem .",
    "looking beyond the sm , the newly proposed little higgs scenarios  @xcite provide a dynamical way to generate the ewsb , in contrast to the _ ad hoc _ introduction of the elementary scalar sector .",
    "apart from this aesthetically appealing feature , little higgs models provides rich phenomenology with predictions that could be vidicated or ruled out at future colliders such as the lhc and the ilc .",
    "one major feature of such models is the presence of additional gauge bosons in the physical spectrum .",
    "these influence processes like w - pair production in @xmath0 collisions , firstly directly through their exchange in the process , and secondly through the change of standard couplings through mixing with other gauge bosons .",
    "although these additional gauge bosons are typically too heavy to be produced at reference ilc energies of 500 and 800 gev which we use in the present study , their effects manifest themselves as stated above .",
    "recently it was pointed out , in a preliminary study , that for one such model known as the littlest higgs model ( lhm ) , the fraction of longitudinally and transversely polarized of one of the w s could be significantly different from the corresponding fraction in the sm  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider a refined treatment of the lhm to be described below , and extend the prior work to polarization fractions and total cross - sections of the w s , energy and angular distributions of decay leptons , as well as to observables like the forward - backward and left - right asymmetries , which are more sensitive to the effects of the lhm compared to the cross - sections .",
    "the ilc is expected to have large beam polarizations which will significantly enhance the sensitivity to new physics , for a review , see ref .",
    "we consider different beam polarizations with the aim of improving the sensitivity of the observables considered here .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section 2 we , very briefly , introduce the lhm , and describe its particle spectrum and couplings relevant to @xmath1 . in section 3",
    "we present our analysis of the total cross section and w - polarization fractions in the lhm and compare with the sm case . in section 4",
    "we take up the task of probing the model by considering decay of one of the @xmath2 to a lepton pair .",
    "we consider the energy and angular distributions for the cases of sm and lhm .",
    "we also discuss the left - right as well as forward - backward asymmetry in this section .",
    "finally we summarize our study and present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "note that we have included beam polarization effects in this study in each of the relevant sections .",
    "in little higgs models @xcite a non - linear realization of some global symmetry @xmath4 broken down to @xmath5 is considered .",
    "the nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) of the symmetry breaking are candidate higgs fields . in a specific model , called lhm @xcite @xmath6 is broken down to @xmath7 via a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of order @xmath8 .",
    "interactions of ngb s are described by a non - linear sigma model , which is an effective theory valid below the cut off @xmath9 . in the version of the lhm @xcite we will consider in this report ,",
    "@xmath10 is gauged , which is broken down to the sm gauge group @xmath11 . under this , the 14 ngb s transform as a real singlet , a real triplet , a complex doublet and a complex triplet .",
    "the real fields become the longitudinal degrees of the heavy gauge bosons , while the sm gauge bosons , @xmath12 and @xmath13 remain massless at this stage .",
    "the doublet ngb field has the correct quantum numbers to be identified as the standard higgs doublet . at tree level",
    ", they have only derivative couplings , but quantum corrections at one - loop level generate a coleman - weinberg potential with quadratic and quartic terms , consequently breaking electroweak symmetry .",
    "gauge symmetry is constructed such that , in the absence of any one ( original ) gauge interaction the higgs is massless to all orders .",
    "this also ensures that quadratically divergent contributions to the mass - square term at one - loop level are cancelled between the gauge bosons from the two sectors .",
    "logarithmically divergent terms contribute to the potential . in order to avoid a quadratic divergence due to a top - quark loop ,",
    "a pair of ( weak - singlet ) weyl quarks @xmath14 is introduced , which mix with the ordinary left- and right- quarks to give mass eigenstates . here",
    "again , it is so arranged such that the quadratic divergence coming from the standard top - quark is cancelled by its heavy counterpart , and the logarithmically divergent part is added to the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "the model achieves ewsb , at the same time , protecting the higgs mass from accquiring quadratically divergent corrections at one loop .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that these models will have a rich phenomenology with distinct signatures that can be probed at upcoming collider experiments .",
