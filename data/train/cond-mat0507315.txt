    "the little - parks effect concerns the electrical resistance of a thin cylindrically - shaped superconducting film and , specifically , the dependence of this resistance on the magnetic flux threading the cylinder  @xcite .",
    "it is found that the resistance is a periodic function of the magnetic field , with period inversely proportional to the cross - sectional area of the cylinder .",
    "similarly , in a dc squid , the critical value of the supercurrent is periodic in magnetic field , with period inversely proportional to the area enclosed by the squid ring  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a mesoscopic analog of a dc squid .",
    "the analog consists of a device composed of a thin superconducting film patterned into two mesoscopic leads that are connected by a pair of ( topologically ) parallel , short , weak , superconducting wires .",
    "thus , we refer to the device as an nquid ( superconducting nanowire quantum interference device ) .",
    "the only restriction that we place on the wires of the device is that they be thin enough for the order parameter to be taken as constant over each cross - section of a wire , varying only along the wire length . in principle , this condition of one - dimensionality is satisfied if the wire is much thinner than the superconducting coherence length @xmath0 . in practice , it is approximately satisfied provided the wire diameter @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath2  @xcite . for thicker wires , vortices can exist inside the wires , and such wires may not be assumed to be one dimensional .",
    "by the term _ mesoscopic _ we are characterizing phenomena that occur on length - scales larger than the superconducting coherence length @xmath0 but smaller than the electromagnetic penetration depth @xmath3 associated with magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the superconducting film .",
    "we shall call a lead mesoscopic if at least one of its two long dimensions is in the mesoscopic regime ; the other dimension may be either mesoscopic or macroscopic .",
    "thus , a weak magnetic field applied perpendicular to a mesoscopic lead will penetrate the lead without appreciable attenuation and without driving the lead from the homogeneous superconducting state to the abrikosov vortex state .",
    "this is similar to the regime of operation of superconducting wire networks ; see e.g. , ref .",
    "the nanowires connecting the two leads are taken to be topologically parallel ( i.e.  parallel in the sense of electrical circuitry ) : these nanowires and edges of the leads define a closed geometrical contour , which will be referred to as the _ aharonov - bohm ( ab ) contour_. in our approach , the nanowires are considered to be links sufficiently weak that any effects of the nanowires on the superconductivity in the leads can be safely ignored .    the theory presented here has been developed to explain experiments conducted on dna - templated nquids  @xcite .",
    "these experiments measure the electrical resistivity of a pair of superconducting nanowires suspended between long superconducting strips ( see fig .  [ device ] ) . in them ,",
    "a current source is used to pass dc current from a contact on the far end of the left lead to one on the far end of the right lead .",

    ", width=302 ]        in the light of the foregoing remarks , the multiple - connectedness of the device suggests that one should anticipate oscillations with magnetic field , e.g. , in the device resistance .",
    "oscillations are indeed observed .",
    "but they are distinct from the resistance oscillations observed by little and parks and from the critical current oscillations observed in squid rings . what distinguishes the resistance oscillations reported in ref .",
    "@xcite from those found , e.g. , by little and parks ?",
    "first , the most notable aspect of these oscillations is the value of their period . in the little - parks type of experiment",
    ", the period is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the superconducting flux quantum , @xmath8 is the bridge separation , and @xmath9 is the bridge length , i.e. , the superconducting flux quantum divided by the area of the ab contour ( see fig .  [ coordinates ] ) . in a high - magnetic - field regime , such periodic behavior is indeed observed experimentally , with the length of the period somewhat shorter but of the same order of magnitude as in the ab effect  @xcite . however , in a low - magnetic - field regime , the observed period is appreciably smaller ( in fact by almost two orders of magnitude for our device geometry ) .",
    "second , because the resistance is caused by thermal phase fluctuations ( i.e.  phase slips ) in very narrow wires , the oscillations are observable over a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "third , the little - parks resistance is wholly ascribed to a rigid shift of the @xmath11 curve with magnetic field , as @xmath12 oscillates .",
    "in contrast , in our system we observe a periodic broadening of the transition ( instead of the little - parks  type rigid shift ) with magnetic field .",
    "our theory explains quantitatively this broadening via the modulation of the barrier heights for phase slips of the superconducting order parameter in the nanowires .    in the experiment ,",
    "the sample is cooled in zero magnetic field , and the field is then slowly increased while the resistance is measured . at a sample - dependent field ( @xmath13 )",
    "the behavior switches sharply from a low - field to a high - field regime .",
    "if the high - field regime is not reached before the magnetic field is swept back , the low - field resistance curve is reproduced . however , once the high - field regime has been reached , the sweeping back of the field reveals phase shifts and hysteresis in the @xmath14 curve .",
    "the experiments  @xcite mainly address rectangular leads that have one mesoscopic and one macroscopic dimension .",
    "therefore , we shall concentrate on such strip geometries .",
    "we shall , however , also discuss how to extend our approach to generic ( mesoscopic ) lead shapes .",
    "we note in passing that efficient numerical methods , such as the boundary element method ( bem )  @xcite , are available for solving the corresponding laplace problems .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec_phys ]",
    "we construct a basic picture for the period of the magnetoresistance oscillations of the two - wire device , which shows how the mesoscopic size of the leads accounts for the anomalously short magnetoresistance period in the low - field regime . in section [ sec : leads ] we concentrate on the properties of mesoscopic leads with regard to their response to an applied magnetic field , and in section [ sec : bridges ] we extend the lamh model to take into account the inter - wire coupling through the leads .",
    "analytical expressions are derived for the short- and long - wire limits , whilst a numerical procedure is described for the general case .",
    "the predictions of the model are compared with data from our experiment in section [ sec : experiment ] , and we give some concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "certain technical components are relegated to the appendix , as is the analysis of example multiwire devices .",
    "before presenting a detailed development of the theory , we give an intuitive argument to account for the anomalously - short period of the magnetoresistance in the low - magnetic - field regime , mentioned above .",
    "the geometry of the devices studied experimentally is shown in fig .",

    "five devices were successfully fabricated and measured .",
    "the dimensions of these devices are listed in table  [ table : period ] , along with the short magnetoresistance oscillation period .",

    "( b )  sketch of the corresponding superconducting phase at different points along the ab contour when one vortex is located inside the contour.,width=302 ]    the essential ingredients in our model are ( i )  leads , in which the applied magnetic field induces supercurrents and hence gradients in the phase of the order parameter , and ( ii )  the two wires , whose behavior is controlled parametrically by the leads through the boundary conditions imposed by the leads on the phase of the order parameters in the wires . for now , we assume that the wires have sufficiently small cross - sections that the currents through them do not feed back on the order parameter in the leads .",
    "( in section  [ sec : blcouple ] we shall discuss when this assumption may be relaxed without altering the oscillation period . )  the dissipation results from thermally activated phase slips , which cause the superconducting order parameter to explore a discrete family of local minima of the free energy .",
    "( we assume that the barriers separating these minima are sufficiently high to make them well - defined states . )",
    "these minima ( and the saddle - point configurations connecting them ) may be indexed by the net ( i.e.  forward minus reverse ) number of phase slips that have occurred in each wire ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 , relative to some reference state ) .",
    "more usefully , they can be indexed by @xmath23 ( i.e.  the net number of phase slips that have occurred in both wires ) and @xmath24 ( i.e.  the number of vortices enclosed by the ab contour , which is formed by the wires and the edges of the leads ) .",
    "we note that two configurations with identical @xmath25 but distinct @xmath26 and @xmath27 have identical order parameters , but differ in energy by @xmath28 due to the work done by the current source supplying the current @xmath29 , in which @xmath30 is the inter - lead voltage , @xmath31 is the inter - lead phase difference as measured between the two points half - way between the wires , and the josephson relation @xmath32 has been invoked . in our model , we assume that the leads are completely rigid",
    ". therefore the rate of phase change , and thus the voltage , is identical at all points inside one lead . for sufficiently short wires",
    ", @xmath25 has a unique value , as there are no stable states with any other number of vortices .    due to the screening currents in the left lead , induced by the applied magnetic field @xmath5 ( and independent of the wires ) , there is a field - dependent phase @xmath33 ( computed below ) accumulated in passing from the point at which wire 1 ( the top wire ) contacts the left ( l ) lead to the point at which wire 2 ( the bottom wire ) contacts the left lead ( see fig .",
    "[ loop ] ) .",
    "similarly , the field creates a phase accumulation @xmath34 between the contact points in the right ( r ) lead .",
    "as the leads are taken to be geometrically identical , the phase accumulations in them differ in sign only : @xmath35 .",
    "we introduce @xmath36 . in determining the local free - energy minima of the wires , we solve the ginzburg - landau equation for the wires for each vortex number @xmath25 , imposing the single - valuedness condition on the order parameter , @xmath37 this condition",
    "will be referred to as the _ phase constraint_. here , @xmath38 is the phase accumulated along wire 1 in passing from the right to the left lead ; @xmath39 is similarly defined for wire 2 .    absent any constraints ,",
    "the lowest energy configuration of the nanowires is the one with no current through the wires . here",
    ", we adopt the gauge in which @xmath40 for the electromagnetic vector potential , where the coordinates are as shown in fig .",
    "[ coordinates ] .",
    "the ginzburg - landau expression for the current density in a superconductor is @xmath41 for our choice of gauge , the vector potential is always parallel to the nanowires , and therefore the lowest energy state of the nanowires corresponds to a phase accumulation given by the flux through the ab contour , @xmath42 .",
    "as we shall show shortly , for our device geometry ( i.e.  when the wires are sufficiently short , i.e. , @xmath43 ) , this phase accumulation may be safely ignored , compared to the phase accumulation @xmath44 associated with screening currents induced in the leads . as the nanowires are assumed to be weak compared to the leads , to satisfy the phase constraint  ( [ eq : phaseconstraint ] )",
    ", the phase accumulations in the nanowires will typically deviate from their optimal value , generating a circulating current around the ab contour . as a consequence of lamh theory , this circulating current results in a decrease of the barrier heights for phase slips , and hence an increase in resistance .",
    "the period of the observed oscillations is derived from the fact that whenever the magnetic field satisfies the relation @xmath45 [ where @xmath46 is an integer and the factor of @xmath47 accompanying @xmath44 reflects the presence of two leads ] , there is no circulating current in the lowest in energy state , resulting in minimal resistance .",
    "furthermore , the family of free energy - minima of the two - wire system ( all of which , in thermal equilibrium , are statistically populated according to their energies ) is identical to the @xmath48 case .",
    "the mapping between configurations at zero and nonzero @xmath5 fields is established by a shift of the index @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , as the sets of physical states of the wires are identical whenever the periodicity condition  ( [ eq : period ] ) is satisfied , at such values of @xmath5 the resistance returns to its @xmath48 value .      in this subsection , we will give a `` back of the envelope '' estimate for the phase gain @xmath44 in a lead by considering the current and phase profiles in one such lead . according to the ginzburg - landau theory , in a mesoscopic superconductor , subjected to a weak magnetic field ,",
    "the current density is given by .",
    "now consider an isolated strip - shaped lead used in the device .",
    "far from either of the short edges of this lead , @xmath40 is a london gauge  @xcite , i.e. , along all surfaces of the superconductor @xmath50 is parallel to them ; @xmath51 in the center of the superconductor ; and @xmath52 . in this special case , the london relation   is a london gauge everywhere ( with our choice of gauge , @xmath40 , this is the case for an infinitely long strip ) . by using the requirement that @xmath52 , together with , we see that @xmath53 satisfies the laplace equation",
    "we further insist that no current flows out of the superconductor , i.e. , along all surfaces the supercurrent density , , is always parallel to the surface .",
    "together with the requirement that along all surfaces @xmath50 is parallel to them , this implies the boundary condition that @xmath54 .",
    "next , it can be shown that this boundary condition implies that @xmath53 must be a constant function of position in order to satisfy the laplace equation , and therefore   simplifies to read @xmath55 , which is known as the london relation . ]",
    "states that the supercurrent density is proportional to the vector potential in the london gauge . using this relation",
    ", we find that the supercurrent density is @xmath56 , i.e. , there is a supercurrent density of magnitude @xmath57 flowing to the left at the top ( long ) edge of the strip and to the right at the bottom ( long ) edge . at the two short ends of the strip ,",
    "the two supercurrents must be connected , so there is a supercurrent density of magnitude @xmath58 flowing down the left ( short ) edge of the strip and up the right ( short ) edge ( see fig .",

    "near the short ends of the strips , our choice of gauge no longer satisfies the criteria for being a london gauge , and therefore @xmath59 may be nonzero . as , in our choice of gauge , @xmath50 points in the @xmath60 direction ,",

    "as we shall show , @xmath70 depends only weakly on @xmath71 , and is constant in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we obtain the magnetoresistance period by substituting into : @xmath73^{-1 } \\ , . \\label{p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we see that for certain geometries the period is largely determined not by the flux threading through the geometric area @xmath74 but by the response of the leads and the corresponding effective area @xmath75 , provided the nanowires are sufficiently short ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) , justifying our assumption of ignoring the phase gradient induced in the nanowires by the magnetic field .    in fact , we can also make a prediction for the periodicity of the magnetoresistance at high magnetic fields , i.e. , when vortices have penetrated the leads ( see section  [ sec : likharev ] ) . to do this",
    ", we should replace @xmath76 in   by the characteristic inter - vortex spacing @xmath77 .",
    "note that if @xmath77 is comparable to @xmath9 , we can no longer ignore the flux through the ab contour . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath78 then the flux through the ab contour determines periodicity and one recovers the usual aharonov - bohm type of phenomenology .",
    "in this section and the following one we shall develop a detailed model of the leads and nanowires that constitute the mesoscopic device .",
    "two distinct regimes of magnetic field are expected , depending on whether or not there are trapped ( i.e.  locally stable ) vortices inside the leads . as described by likharev  @xcite ,",
    "a vortex inside a superconducting strip - shaped lead is subject to two forces .",
    "first , due to the the currents induced by the magnetic field there is a magnus force pushing it towards the middle of the strip .",
    "second , there is a force due to image vortices ( which are required to enforce the boundary condition that no current flows out of the strip and into the vacuum ) pulling the vortex towards the edge . when the two forces balance at the edge of the strip , there is no energy barrier preventing vortex penetration and vortices enter .",
    "likharev has estimated of the corresponding critical magnetic field to be @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the width of the strip and @xmath81 for strips that are much narrower than the penetration depth ( i.e.  for @xmath82 ) .",
    "likharev has also shown that , once inside a strip , vortices remain stable inside it down to a much lower magnetic field @xmath83 , given by @xmath84 at fields above @xmath85 the potential energy of a vortex inside the strip is lower than for one outside ( i.e.  for a virtual vortex  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , for magnetic fields in the range @xmath86 vortices would remain trapped inside the strip , but only if at some previous time the field were larger than @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates that hysteresis with respect to magnetic field variations should be observed , once @xmath88 exceeds @xmath87 and vortices become trapped in the leads .    in real samples , in addition to the effects analyzed by likharev",
    ", there are also likely to be locations ( e.g.  structural defects ) that can pin vortices , even for fields smaller than @xmath83 , so the reproducibility of the resistance _ vs. _  field curve is not generally expected once @xmath87 has been surpassed .    as magnetic field at which vortices first enter the leads is sensitive to the properties of their edges , we expect only rough agreement with likharev s theory . for sample 219 - 4 ,",
    "using likharev s formula , we estimate @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) . the change in regime from fast to slow oscillations",
    "is found to occur at @xmath91 for that sample  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to determine the critical magnetic fields @xmath87 and @xmath85 by the direct imaging of vortices .",
    "although we do not know of such a direct measurement of @xmath87 , @xmath85 was determined by field cooling niobium strips , and found to agree in magnitude to likharev s estimate  @xcite .      in the previous section",
    "it was shown that the periodicity of the magnetoresistance is due to the phase accumulations associated with the currents along the edges of the leads between the nanowires .",
    "thus , we should make a precise calculation of the dependence of these currents on the magnetic field , and this we now do .      to compute @xmath44",

    "we have not been able to find a closed - form expression for the intrinsic resistance in the intermediate - length regime , so we shall consider that case numerically .",
    "there are two ( limiting ) kinds of experiments that may be performed : fixed total current and fixed voltage . in the first kind , a specified current is driven through the device and the time - averaged voltage is measured . here",
    ", this voltage is proportional to the net number of phase slips ( in the forward direction ) per unit time , which depends on the height of the free - energy barriers for phase slips .",
    "why do we expect minima in the resistance at magnetic fields corresponding to @xmath169 and maxima at @xmath170 for @xmath46 integral , at least at vanishingly small total current through both wires ?",

    "there is a nonzero circulating current around the ab contour .",
    "quite generally , the heights of the free - energy barriers protecting locally stable states decrease with increasing current through a wire , and thus the frustrated situation is more susceptible to dissipative fluctuations , and hence shows higher resistance .",
    "note , however , that due to the inter - bridge coupling caused by the phase constraint , the resistance of the full device is more subtle than the mere addition of the resistances of two independent , parallel nanowires , both carrying the requisite circulating current .    in the second kind of experiment ,",
    "a fixed voltage is applied across the device and the total current is measured .",
    "in this situation , the inter - lead voltage is fixed , and therefore the phase drop along each wire is a fixed function of time . hence , there is no inter - bridge coupling in the fixed voltage regime .",
    "therefore , the resistance of the device would not exhibit magnetic field dependence .",
    "if the voltage is fixed far away from the wires , but not in the immediate vicinity of the wires , so that the phase drop along each wire is not rigidly fixed , then some of the magnetic field dependence of the resistance would be restored . in our experiments on two - wire devices",
    ", we believe that the situation lies closer to the fixed current limit than to the fixed voltage limit , and therefore we shall restrict our attention to the former limit .    in the fixed - current regime ,",
    "the relevant independent thermodynamic variable for the device is the total current through the pair of wires , i.e. , @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , the appropriate free energy to use , in obtaining the barrier heights for phase slips , is the gibbs free energy @xmath172 , as discussed by mccumber  @xcite , rather than the helmholtz free energy @xmath173  , subject to the phase accumulation constraint @xmath174 . ] . in the helmholtz free energy",

    "in the second kind of process ( fig .",
    "[ tunnel_pic]b ) , the phase slips occur sequentially : a vortex ( or anti - vortex ) enters the ab contour by passing across the top ( or bottom ) wire , stays inside the contour for some time - interval , and then leaves the ab contour through the bottom ( or top ) wire  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to extend lamh theory to take into account the influence of the wires on each other . in appendix",
    "[ lamh1 ] , we review some necessary ingredients associated with the lamh theory of a single wire . as the wires used in the experiments are relatively short ( i.e.  10 to 20 zero - temperature coherence lengths in length ) , we also take care to correctly treat the wires as being of finite length .",
    "recall that we are considering experiments performed at a fixed total current , and accordingly , in all configurations of the order parameter this current must be shared between the top and bottom wires .",
    "we shall refer to this sharing , @xmath199 as the _ total current constraint_. let us begin by considering a phase - slip event in a device with an isolated wire .",

    "taking into account the two kinds of phase - slip processes , and imposing the appropriate constraints ( i.e.  the total current constraint and the phase constraint ) , we construct the possible metastable and saddle - point configurations of the order parameter in the two - wire system . finally , we compute the relevant rates of thermally activated transitions between these metastable states , construct a markov chain  @xcite , and determine the steady - state populations of these states .",
