    "glass forming systems , like supercooled liquids , display remarkable dynamical properties , and are the subject of intense experimental and theoretical studies ( for reviews see @xcite ) . out of all glass formers ,",
    "the ones which have the seemingly simpler macroscopic behaviour are strong liquids , typically covalently bonded systems like sio@xmath0 and geo@xmath0 , in which viscosities and relaxation times increase exponentially with decreasing temperature , following a simple arrhenius law @xcite . while the increase of timescales in strong systems is not as dramatic as in fragile ones , it is still very pronounced , and , moreover , it is not accompanied by the growth of static lengthscales or similar corresponding structural signatures .    the separation of statics and dynamics is a central feature of structural glass formers @xcite , and is in marked contrast with other dynamically arrested systems , like spin glasses and other systems with quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "this leads naturally to an approach for modeling these systems based on the idea that glassiness is not a consequence of disorder or frustration in the static interactions but of constraints on their dynamics @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to build on our earlier efforts in the modeling of covalent systems and froths @xcite , where the dynamical constraints that lead to glassy slowdown can be related directly to elementary structural processes , and develop a class of models which retain the essential features but are simple enough to allow for analytical solutions , and study in detail the connection with underlying effective diffusion ",
    "annihilation processes @xcite which we believe are an essential component of strong glass formers in general .",
    "the models we study in this work are described explicitly and concisely in section [ model ] . here",
    "we outline briefly the background considerations which were their conceptual basis .",
    "they are a distillation of a series of minimalist models exhibiting strong glass  like dynamical behaviour through the operation of kinetic constraints despite non  interacting hamiltonians and trivial thermodynamics ( with no equilibrium phase transitions ) and no imposed quenched disorder .",
    "the first model@xcite was a 2dimensional topological ` foam ' consisting of a fully pairwise connected network of three  armed vertices with energy function @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of edges ( sides ) of cell @xmath3 ; thus it emulates desire for local hexagonal structure without the complication of interaction .",
    "the dynamics is @xmath4 ( see fig .  [ t1 ] ) performed stochastically with acceptance probabilities determined by the boltzmann ratio @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the resultant energy change and @xmath7 is the temperature .",
    "this ensures eventual equilibration at any finite temperature but also provides a kinetic constraint since each @xmath4 move involves four cells , decreases @xmath8 by @xmath9 for each of the two initially adjacent cells and increases @xmath8 of the other two by the same amount .",
    "this model can be considered variously as an idealization of a glass of covalent @xmath10 hybrid bonds which change connections , or of the voronoi cells surrounding a fluid of atoms , or of a foam ; in the first case effectively allowing for harmonic changes of vertex angle energy but ignoring cell  cell correlation energies , in the second and third replacing continuous energies associated with interatomic forces or surface tension by the simple topological energies . at low temperatures the model exhibits two  timescale macro  behaviour , for example in the decay of the energy from a random start or in the autocorrelation function even in equilibrium .",
    "the fast timescale is temperature independent and the slow timescale is arrhenius  like : @xmath11 , @xmath12@xcite .",
    "this behaviour can be understood by considering @xmath13 as ` perfect ' and @xmath14 as ` defect ' cells , and the cooperative behaviour in terms of the diffusion and annihilation of defects .",
    "the fast processes correspond to ones which involve either an energy decrease or no energy change , while the slow processes involve energetic defect creation .",
    "defects with @xmath15 disappear rapidly at low temperature so we concentrate on @xmath16 .",
    "let us denote @xmath17 cells by @xmath18 and @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "then energy reduction is due to the annihilation of an @xmath21 neighbouring pair ( or dimer ) .",
    "the @xmath4 process however involves four cells and only allows @xmath21 dimer annihilation if at most only one of the other cells involved is a @xmath20 ; thus the annihilation of two dimers@xcite @xmath22 exists as well as the single dimer annihilation@xcite @xmath23 @xmath21 dimers can diffuse on the fast ( microscopic attempt ) timescale if the other pair of cells in the @xmath4 process are both @xmath20 : @xmath24 defects are only annihilated in dimer pairs ( @xmath21 ) and isolated defects must be paired to annihilate , hence they must be moved together .",
    "however they can only move via processes which involve the creation of an @xmath21 dimer and a consequent energetic penalty ; i.e. by the inverses of processes ( [ anni ] ) @xmath25 which are slower by the boltzmann factor @xmath26 .",
    "dimer pairs , of either of the two possible @xmath21 combinations on the right hand sides of processes ( [ creation ] ) can then diffuse away freely by process ( [ diffusion ] ) .",
    "processes ( [ anni ] ) themselves also allow slow movement of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) via collision with a roaming @xmath21 dimer , leading to annihilation of all three @xmath29 but creation of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) on the cell which was originally @xmath20 .",
    "this also involves a slowing factor @xmath30 since the equilibrium density of @xmath21 dimers involves such a factor . as a consequence , at low temperatures , the energy after a quench from a random / high temperature start quickly decays to a plateau through elimination of @xmath21 dimers , leaving mainly ( and at @xmath31 only ) isolated defects and clusters of only like defects . after this plateau",
    ", the energy further decays to equilibrium with the arrhenius  like timescale @xmath32 due to the effective dimer  mediated diffusion of isolated defects and eventual @xmath21 pairing and annihilation .",
    "the second generation of models is built on the above picture , replacing the foam by lattice ",
    "based models with ` spins ' associated with the dual plaquettes@xcite @xmath33 the energy by @xmath34 and the @xmath4 move by one involving four spins around a corresponding ` feyman diagram ' edge in a hexagonal lattice , a square vertex in a square lattice , etc.@xcite . for @xmath35",
    "this behaves essentially as for the foam model@xcite , but allows much larger simulations .",
    "the resultant better ",
    "accuracy data permits comparison with the asymptotic predictions of the field theory of simple diffusion ",
    "annihilation processes@xcite of type @xmath36 ( in the usual notation of that subject ) ; the agreement is quite good for both decays which can be viewed as diffusion  annihilation processes with different timescales@xcite .",
    "the second class of models permits a further modification , the taking of @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the ground state is highly degenerate ( @xmath38 independently on each plaquette ) , as compared with the unique ground state for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ; all @xmath3 ) , but the defects are of only one type ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the two timescale behaviour of the energy decay to equilibrium and of the equilibrium autocorrelation functions persists . ignoring the complications of the ground state degeneracy and further constraints imposed by the @xmath4 process ( @xmath41 can not be increased above @xmath9 ) the behaviour is now describable in terms of only @xmath27 , @xmath20 dynamics",
    "( the @xmath20 now referring to @xmath42 and @xmath27 to @xmath43 ) .",
    "the qualitative discussion earlier still applies with @xmath28 ( or @xmath44 ) replaced by @xmath27 . again",
    "the comparison with the predictions of simple field theory of diffusion  annihilation is fair , but less precise , presumably in part due to the more complicated ground state degeneracy and constraints .",
    "the models studied in this paper are a further simplification which maintain the features of ( i ) fast annihilation of dimers , ( ii ) fast diffusion of dimers , ( iii ) motion of isolated defects only by slow creation of dimers .",
    "it allows for either a single defect type ( @xmath27 ) and identical  defect dimers ( @xmath45 ) or two defect types ( @xmath27 and @xmath44 ) and mixed dimers ( @xmath46 ) , but in both cases with a non  degenerate ( @xmath47 absorbing ) ground state ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "they also allow separation of the timescales for processes ( i ) and ( ii ) above , as well as their separation from ( iii ) . the explicit formulation is given in the next section , but the above should clarify why they are appropriate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we give a full description of the models studied in this work .",
    "their general features are discussed and compared with those of previous models is section [ features ] . in section [ solution ]",
    "we solve analytically the mean  field version of the models .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "details of the analytical calculations are provided in the appendices .",
    "the minimalist models we study here are based on a coarse  grained simplification of the ideas described above .",
    "they correspond to defects ( or particles ) , which can be either of a single kind @xmath27 , or different kinds , @xmath27 and @xmath44 , and live in a @xmath48 dimensional lattice .",
    "they can also be considered as a generalization of backgammon @xcite or urn models @xcite to a non  constant number of particles , with energetic barriers rather than entropic ones , thus allowing for the existence of activated processes .",
    "the analogy with previous models @xcite is obtained through the dynamical rules which mimic the different processes ( [ anni ] ) , ( [ diffusion ] ) and ( [ creation ] ) .",
    "the two models under consideration are the following .",
    "as for previous models , with each defect ( particle in our case ) we associate a unit energy ( @xmath49 ) leading to the hamiltonian @xmath50 with @xmath2 the occupation number on site @xmath3 . due to the non - interacting hamiltonian , the equilibrium properties are trivial . the probabilities @xmath51 to have @xmath8 particles on a given site at temperature @xmath52",
    "are : @xmath53 and lead to an equilibrium energy or concentration of particles : @xmath54 with @xmath55 the maximum number of particles per site . in the following we use the smallest number ( @xmath56 ) compatible with the dynamical rules .",
    "the infinite temperature concentration @xmath57 corresponds to equal probabilities @xmath58 whereas the low temperature concentration vanishes as @xmath59 .",
    "the dynamical rules are inspired from the @xmath4 moves@xcite .",
    "three different kinds of moves are considered@xcite : + ( i ) the annihilation of two particles analogous to processes ( [ anni ] ) : three particles disappear from site @xmath3 and only one appears on a neighbouring site @xmath60 with a rate @xmath9 @xmath61 ( ii ) the dimer diffusion analogous to process ( [ diffusion ] ) : two particles move from site @xmath3 to a neighbouring site @xmath60 with a diffusive rate @xmath62 @xmath63 ( iii ) the creation of two particles analogous to processes ( [ creation ] ) : a particle disappears from site @xmath3 to create three particles on a neighboring site @xmath60 with a rate @xmath64 @xmath65 those moves have also to respect the maximal number of particles per site @xmath56 .",
    "the rates considered satisfy detailed balance with respect to hamiltonian ( [ hache ] ) , ensuring that the equilibrium properties [ equations ( [ proba ] ) and ( [ concentration ] ) ] will be reached asymptotically by the dynamics .",
    "all these processes are of the form @xmath66 with @xmath67 , which reflects the four cell character of the original model transitions .    the introduction of a diffusive constant @xmath62 allows to separate explicitly the timescales for diffusion of dimers from that of the annihilation process .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that those rules are defined for any dimension and any lattice , even for a fully connected network , leading the possibility to study the mean  field version of the model .",
    "a possible modification of the model consists in considering two different types of particles ( @xmath27 and @xmath44 ) to keep the analogy with the possible sign of the topological charges @xmath68 of the cells in the foam model . as a consequence ,",
    "the dynamical rules are closer to the @xmath4 move .",
    "this modification allows to stress the relation between the last decay of the energy or concentration of particles and diffusion ",
    "annihilation processes@xcite , since the critical dimension and exponents for the @xmath36 process is different from those of the @xmath69 one .",
    "the presence of two types of particles introduce modifications to the equilibrium properties . in the following we still consider a restriction on the number of particles per site ( @xmath70 ) irrespective of their nature , but , in addition , the difference between the numbers of @xmath27 and @xmath44 particles on a site is limited to @xmath71 or @xmath9 ( this last restriction absent within the previous model avoids configurations with all @xmath27 s or all @xmath44 s on a given site ) . as a consequence the equilibrium probabilities to have @xmath72 particles @xmath27 and @xmath73 particles @xmath44 on a given site are ( with @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 leading to the equilibrium concentration of particles : @xmath76 with : @xmath77 and @xmath78 the heaviside function ( @xmath79 if @xmath80 and @xmath81 otherwise ) .    the infinite temperature concentration of particles is @xmath82 [ six possible configurations with equal probabilities : @xmath83 and @xmath84 whereas for low temperatures the concentration vanishes as @xmath85 ( the coefficient @xmath86 is coming from an entropic effect due to the two types of particles ) .",
    "the dynamical rules are a straightforward generalization of the @xmath4 moves@xcite .",
    "three different kinds of moves are considered :    \\(i ) annihilation of an @xmath46 dimer analogous to processes ( [ anni ] ) , an @xmath46 dimer and another particle disappear from site @xmath3 but only the single particle appears on a neighbouring site @xmath60 with a rate @xmath9    @xmath87 \\to [ ( \\emptyset)_i,(ax)_j ] , \\;\\;\\ ; [ ( abb)_i,(x)_j ] \\to [ ( \\emptyset)_i,(bx)_j]\\ ] ]    \\(ii ) @xmath46 dimer diffusion analogous to process ( [ diffusion ] ) , a dimer moves from site @xmath3 to a neighbouring site @xmath60 with a diffusive rate @xmath62 @xmath88 \\to [ ( x)_i,(aby)_j]\\ ] ]    \\(iii ) creation of an @xmath46 dimer analogous to processes ( [ creation ] ) , a single particle from site @xmath3 move to a neighbouring site @xmath60 creating a dimer on this site with a rate @xmath89    @xmath90 \\to [ ( x)_i,(aab)_j ] , \\;\\;\\ ; [ ( bx)_i,(\\emptyset)_j ] \\to [ ( x)_i,(abb)_j]\\ ] ]    in all of these processes , symbols @xmath91 and @xmath92 stand for possible @xmath27 , @xmath44 or @xmath20 particles respecting the restrictions in the number of particles on each site .",
    "the rates again satisfy detailed balance conditions , ensuring equilibration .",
    "we now show that the two models introduced in the last section share common behaviour for all dimensions and with the models considered previously@xcite . in what follows",
    "we discuss equilibrium dynamical properties , in particular the existence of two different timescales , as well as out  of  equilibrium features like the multi  stage decay of the energy density after a quench .",
    "let us first consider the equilibrium dynamical properties of these systems . as we already mentioned , the dynamical behaviour is characteristic of a strong glass@xcite .",
    "the relaxation time increases exponentially with the inverse temperature , corresponding to an arrhenius law . a simple way to determine",
    "this relaxation time is from the auto ",
    "correlation function : @xmath93 with the brackets denoting ensemble average . in equilibrium",
    "this two  time function reduces to a single time equilibrium correlation @xmath94 due to the time translational invariance .",
    "we can define the relaxation time @xmath95 from @xmath96 , where the connected correlation @xmath97 . at low temperatures and for all diffusive constants , the temperature dependent and",
    "slower process is the creation of particles which has energy barrier @xmath98 . as a consequence",
    "we expect the following arrhenius law for the relaxation time : @xmath99 this behaviour is confirmed by numerical simulations . the expected arrhenius law ( [ arrhenius ] ) is recovered for all dimensions and all diffusive constants ( see fig .",
    "[ timel ] ) .",
    "similar results are found for the model with two types of particles .",
    "( simulations have been performed using continuous time monte carlo @xcite for systems of @xmath100 sites . )",
    "the equilibrium correlation explicitly shows the two timescale behaviour ( see fig .",
    "[ correleq ] ) : ( i ) dimer diffusion or annihilation on a short timescale independent of the temperature and ( ii ) isolated particle motion through the creation of a dimer on the relaxation timescale . at low temperatures",
    "when the two timescales are well separated the correlation presents a plateau separating the two relaxing decays .",
    "the relative position of this plateau is increasing with decreasing the temperature due to the fast disappearance of dimers .",
    "the decay to zero of the connected correlation is also dimension dependent .",
    "a change of behaviour occurs between the mean - field case ( @xmath101 ) , where it is exponential , and finite dimensions ( @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ correleq ] ) , where it only vanishes algebraically .",
    "the probability for a particle to come back to the same place ( which depends on the dimension of the system ) explains this difference .",
    "we now consider the out  of  equilibrium behaviour of the models , in particular the decay of the concentration of particles ( energy density ) @xmath103 , after a quench from an infinite temperature to a low temperature @xmath7 at time @xmath104 .",
    "this decay shows an interesting structure with two intermediate plateaux when the diffusive constant @xmath62 and the final temperature @xmath7 are such that @xmath105 .",
    "the first regime is dominated by the annihilation process and leads to a configuration with less than three particles on the same site .",
    "this first regime occurs on a timescale of order @xmath9 .",
    "then , the diffusion process comes into play on a timescale of order @xmath106 and the dimers diffuse until they reach a single particle and annihilate . then the system reaches a configuration with mainly isolated particles .",
    "finally , in order to reach the equilibrium concentration of particles , the activated regime involving the effective motion of isolated particles through the creation or annihilation of dimers is necessary and occurs on a timescale of order @xmath107 .",
    "the last regime in the concentration decay ( before the equilibrium concentration is reached ) may also be seen as either @xmath108 or @xmath36 reaction  diffusion processes , depending on the models , since the particles have to pair themselves in order to disappear .",
    "those two processes have different critical behaviours and critical dimensions : @xmath109 for the former and @xmath110 for the later . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect a power law decay : @xmath111 with @xmath112 above the critical dimension @xmath113 , while below the critical dimension @xmath114 , @xmath115 for the @xmath116 case , and @xmath117 for the @xmath118 case @xcite ( at the critical dimension there may be logarithmic corrections ) .    in fig .  [ decay ] ( left ) we present numerical simulations for different dimensions and a diffusive constant @xmath119 of the concentration decay for the model with a single type of particles .",
    "the temperature after the quench is @xmath120 , so the different timescales are well separated ( @xmath121 ) , and the decay presents a two plateau structure .",
    "the first plateau is roughly independent of the dimension whereas the second plateau decreases with increasing dimensions to reach the mean  field value .",
    "notice that the qualitative behaviour is maintained even in the mean  field limit .",
    "the dynamics during the last stage of the decay corresponds to a power law decay with the expected critical exponents @xmath122 .",
    "[ decay ] ( right ) shows similar results for the model with two types of particles , but with a diffusive constant @xmath123 .",
    "the diffusive timescale is now equivalent to the annihilation one , and the decay presents a single plateau structure .",
    "again , we see the critical behaviour during the last stage of the decay , with the critical exponents @xmath122 expected from the theory .    in what follows",
    "we will concentrate mainly on the model with one kind of particle .",
    "the mean  field version of the model where all sites are neighbors allows to write exact evolution equations for the probability @xmath124 of a site @xmath3 to be occupied by @xmath8 particles at time @xmath125 .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath124 read :    [ dynamic ] @xmath126    the time dependence has been omitted for conciseness and the sum over the neighbors has been performed using the fact that the probabilities @xmath127 are indeed independent of the site @xmath60 : @xmath128 notice that the right hand size of each of the equations ( [ dynamic ] ) comprises three pairs of terms , each pair corresponding to a particular process , annihilation , diffusion and creation , with their respective rates .    the dynamical equations satisfy the conservation of probability , @xmath129 , which reduces the number of independent variables to only three , for example @xmath130 and @xmath131 , in the mean  field model .",
    "the trivial equilibrium probabilities : @xmath132 are a stationary solution of eqs .",
    "( [ dynamic ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ dynamic ] ) can be solved numerically to arbitrary accuracy .",
    "however , it is also helpful to consider their approximate solution , regime by regime , to better illustrate the underlying physics .      after a quench from infinite temperature to a temperature @xmath52 , the energy per site or concentration of particles @xmath133 decays from @xmath134 [ @xmath135 for all @xmath136 to its equilibrium value @xmath137 if @xmath7 is low and the diffusive constant small , such that @xmath138 , the energy decay may be decomposed into three different regimes .",
    "the first regime corresponds to the disappearance of sites with @xmath139 particles due to the annihilation process and leads to a first plateau in the decay .",
    "the diffusion comes into play in the second regime and leads to a second plateau . on this plateau",
    "the particles are essentially isolated .",
    "the last regime is an activated one where the creation process is necessary to reach the equilibrium concentration . in previous models",

    "simplify , and only the two first terms on the right hand side are relevant .",

    "a second possibility is to modify the dynamical rules by multiplying the unperturbed rates by another metropolis factor @xmath221 it is easy to see that this modification of the dynamical rules preserves detailed balance with respect to @xmath218 .",
    "the advantage is that this definition allows to extract a response from occupied and unoccupied sites . for simple spin facilitated models the two dynamics yield equivalent responses , the second one being more efficient from the numerical point of view .",
    "we will see below that this equivalence does not hold for the present models .    in order to determine the response function",
    "analytically we assume that only the site @xmath3 is perturbed .",
    "its probabilities @xmath222 are modified accordingly : @xmath223 where @xmath142 are the unperturbed probabilities .",
    "the equations ( [ dynamic ] ) have to be modified to take into account the change of rates .",
    "the zeroth order in @xmath211 gives back the dynamical equations ( [ dynamic ] ) for the unperturbed @xmath142 .",
    "the first order in @xmath211 leads to a system of equations for the responses @xmath224 ( see appendix [ app_resp ] ) .",
    "for the perturbation ( [ perturb2 ] ) , the only relevant response function is @xmath225 . for the case of the modified metropolis ( mm ) it satisfies ( see details of the calculation in appendix [ app_resp ] ) @xmath226 neglecting the third term in the last parenthesis leads to the following approximation : @xmath227 with the time @xmath197 already defined for the correlation function , eq .",
    "( [ tauc ] ) .",
    "the timescale involved in the response and correlation function is thus identical .",
    "[ resp ] shows the accuracy of this analytic result .",
    "the response function is non  monotonic , a common feature of the activated regime @xcite , and also observed in models of vibrated granular matter @xcite . in the present case",
    "the non  monotonic behaviour is given by the fact that the response is the product of a decreasing function , @xmath228 , corresponding to the number of defects able to respond , and an increasing one , @xmath229 , corresponding to the monotonic rescaled equilibrium response function .",
    "the scaling from of the response function given in ( [ respmm ] ) is analogous to that in the fredrickson ",

    "since we are considering the case of long but finite times , and therefore one  time quantities are still changing with time , fd relations have to be considered between the integrated response , @xmath225 , and the difference of the conjugate connected correlation functions , @xmath234 , where @xmath235 ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . in figs . [ fdt](a ) and [ fdt](b ) we show the fd plots for the case of mm and m dynamics , respectively , for temperature @xmath236 and waiting times @xmath237 and @xmath203 ( inset ) .",
    "there are several things to note .",
    "first , despite the fact that both response functions and difference of connected correlations are non  monotonic in @xmath125 ( which implies that the fd curves when plotted parametrically for fixed @xmath208 start from the origin , go up , and then come back again ) , to a very good approximation @xmath238 $ ] , similarly to what was found for other simple strong glass formers @xcite .",
    "second , the fd curves approach the fluctuation  dissipation theorem ( fdt ) value as waiting time is increased , as expected .",
    "third , the fd relations look almost linear ( although this may be just a consequence of the fact that the departure from fdt is relatively small ) . in this case",
    "the fdt violation ratio @xmath239 @xcite is just a function of the waiting time , @xmath240 .",
    "we see from figs .",
    "[ fdt](a ) and [ fdt](b ) that @xmath241 for the case of mm dynamics , while @xmath242 for the case of m dynamics .",
    "this can be traced back to eqs .",
    "( [ correl_ooe],[respmm],[respm ] ) , which lead to @xmath243 , where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to mm ( m ) dynamics , together with the fact that @xmath244 for all times .",
    "an approximation to the value of @xmath245 can be obtained from the following argument .",
    "the slope with which the fd curves leave the origin corresponds to the time regime in which the exponential in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) decreases much more rapidly than @xmath228 [ see eq .",
    "( [ p1wrong ] ) ] .",
    "if we assume that @xmath228 does not change at all in this initial period , we may approximate @xmath246 .",
    "this in turn gives for the fd ratio @xmath247^{-1}$ ] , with the upper ( lower ) sign corresponding to mm ( m ) dynamics .",
    "for the plots of fig .",
    "[ fdt](a ) this approximation predicts @xmath248 for @xmath249 , while a linear fit to the data gives @xmath250 [ @xmath251 and @xmath252 for fig .",

    "finally , in fig.[fdt](c ) we compare the behaviour in the mean  field model with that at finite dimensions . for @xmath253 fdt",
    "is obeyed , similar to what happens in the fredrickson  andersen model @xcite . for @xmath254",
    "however , the fd plots coincide with the mean  field ones .",
    "this indicates that the aging behaviour is controlled by the out  of  equilibrium critical point of the underlying diffusion  annihilation process , and that mean  field serves as a good approximation for the physically relevant dimensions @xmath255 .",
    "in this paper we have introduced simple models inspired by covalent glasses and topological froths .",
    "the models display strong glass forming behaviour despite their trivial thermodynamic properties due to the presence of constraints to the dynamics which generate dynamical frustration .",
    "we have studied the connection with underlying diffusion  annihilation processes , and have shown that the aging dynamics of these models is dominated by the critical out  of  equilibrium fixed point of the associated diffusion  annihilation theory .",
    "we formulated a mean  field version of the models , which keeps most of the features of the finite dimensional ones , and which allows for an extremely accurate analytical solution of the low temperature out  of  equilibrium aging dynamics in the low temperature regime where activated processes play a dominant role .",

    "hpmf - ct-1999 - 00328 , the glasstone fund , and epsrc programme grant gr / r83712 .",
    "the first regime in the concentration decay may be obtained by considering the dynamics at zero temperature and without diffusion ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "the dynamical equations reduce to : @xmath257 with the infinite temperature probabilities @xmath258 as initial conditions .",
    "notice that the right hand side of the equations is proportional to @xmath140 and the derivative of @xmath140 is negative indicating that a first plateau will be reached when @xmath141 with non  zero values for the probabilities @xmath130 and @xmath131 .    in the absence of diffusion , @xmath131 remains approximately constant at its initial value , @xmath259 .",
    "notice that if the initial configuration ( before the quench ) does not correspond to one at infinite temperature , this approximation is no longer valid . using @xmath260 and ( [ p3 ] ) , we are able to deduce : @xmath261 the probabilities @xmath262 and @xmath263 are determined considering the linear combinations @xmath264 with @xmath265 which satisfy the following differential equation : @xmath266 a solution is given by : @xmath267 we deduce the following approximations : @xmath268 with @xmath269 .",
    "here we determine the out  of  equilibrium correlations @xmath185 .",
    "they satisfy the equations ( [ dynamic ] ) , with the replacement of @xmath270 by @xmath185 .",
    "since all correlations with @xmath271 or @xmath272 are at least of order @xmath160 , and the ones with @xmath192 or @xmath193 are irrelevant for the correlation @xmath194 , we concentrate on the set of equations corresponding to @xmath273 : @xmath274 equations ( [ cor_c ] ) and ( [ cor_d ] ) allow to obtain @xmath275 and @xmath276 as functions of @xmath190 and @xmath277 , neglecting their derivatives and using ( [ p3p2approx ] ) , @xmath278 combining all these results and the fact that @xmath279 , we deduce an equation for @xmath190 : @xmath280 @xmath281 is a trivial solution of this equation .",

    "in this appendix we determine the out  of  equilibrium response function corresponding to a perturbation ( [ perturb2 ] ) in the case of mm dynamics ( [ mm ] ) .",

    ", it follows that @xmath298 and we may take @xmath297 as the only relevant response function . in order to determine @xmath297 we need the equations for @xmath299 and @xmath300 for a random variable @xmath301 @xmath302 while for @xmath303 : @xmath304 using ( [ p3p2approx ] ) and neglecting the time derivative of @xmath305 , the resulting equations for @xmath306 are : @xmath307 from these equations we deduce closed linear differential equations for the response functions : @xmath308 for systems where all sites @xmath3 are perturbed with uncorrelated @xmath212 , by self  averaging and linearity , the total response @xmath309 satisfies : @xmath310 discarding the third term in the last parenthesis allows us to solve this differential equation .",
