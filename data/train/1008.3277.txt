    "statistical properties of multiparticle quantum systems are at the heart of statistical physics . the best developed are both experiments and the theory of statistical properties of photons .",
    "in quickly developing physics of quantum degenerate dilute gases there are two aspects that make the problem of thermal equilibrium atom statistics notably different than that of photons .",
    "first , atoms collide and their interaction is necessary for the thermalization process - their approach to thermal equilibrium .",
    "second , total number of atoms is strictly conserved and the experiments on bose - einstein condensation are performed with almost perfect isolation of the system from an exchange of particles with the outside world . moreover , the system often consists of as few as a couple of hundred atoms , thus it is far from a thermodynamic limit . until now , fully understood",
    "is the statistics of an ideal bose gas only @xcite . in a series of papers",
    "it was found that the three commonly used statistical ensembles ( grand canonical , canonical and microcanonical ) while giving identical prediction for the extinction of the condensate with increasing temperature , differ in the predicted fluctuations of the number of condensed atoms . in particular these fluctuations calculated via grand canonical ensemble",
    "are absurdly large .",
    "it is worth noticing that this last observation was already made by e. schrdinger @xcite .",
    "the statistics of a weakly interacting bose gas is still a challenge .",
    "nearly all papers deal with an academic problem of a system of n atoms confined in a rectangular box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are two important simplifying aspects of such a confinement .",
    "first , even in the presence of ( repulsive ) interaction , the condensate wave function is still the zero momentum component of the atomic field just as for the ideal gas .",
    "second is a simplicity of the bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations spectrum and an analytic relation between the annihilation and creation operators of quasiparticles and the corresponding operators for atoms @xcite .",
    "thus , in the bogoliubov approximation , the total hamiltonian may be written as : @xmath0 or a sum of the energy of the condensate @xmath1 and the sum of the independent energies of quasiparticles ( created and annihilated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ) which in this approximation are treated as independent bosons with simple and well understood equilibrium thermodynamic properties . thus ignoring the changing number of background condensed atoms one can compute the statistics of the excited thermal atoms just from the statistics of the independent quasiparticles @xcite . this way one gets a reliable results for low temperatures only . at higher temperatures",
    "the bogoliubov spectrum gets modified and it takes a bogoliubov - popov form @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the spectrum depends on the number of condensed atoms rather than on their total number . moreover , also @xmath1 depends on @xmath4 .",
    "so both parameters depend on the random variable .",
    "this presents a serious technical difficulty @xcite .",
    "it has been overcome in a self - consistent way in @xcite . but",
    "none of these papers takes fully into account the higher order terms in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "physically these terms describe the interaction between quasiparticles that leads to their instability . in a recent paper @xcite we have shown how to calculate the statistical properties of the weakly interacting bose gas retaining full value of the interaction energy . to this end",
    "we have proposed to use the so called classical fields approximation @xcite . in this approximation",
    "all long wave - length degrees of freedom of the atomic field are stripped - off their operator character and are described by complex amplitudes . the question",
    "if practically all atoms may be accounted for within the classical fields has been answered in affirmative . in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that with a proper choice of the short wave - length cut - off all statistical properties of an ideal bose gas may be reproduced using the classical fields . in @xcite",
    "we have applied the classical fields to describe statistical properties of a weakly interacting bosons again confined in a box with the periodic boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we extend the monte carlo method to an experimentally relevant one dimensional weakly interacting bose gas trapped in a harmonic potential .",
    "the results are obtained with the help of the classical fields , but are accounting fully for the interaction energy . in this case",
    "there are both theoretical @xcite and experimental results @xcite for the limited phase coherence of a very cold atomic sample , known as a quasicondensate and also recent measurements of the local density fluctuations @xcite . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we formulate the problem and describe the proposed scheme based on the classic metropolis algorithm . in section [ sec : stats ] we present statistical properties of the condensate . in section",
    "[ sec : corr ] we present the results for low order correlation functions of the whole gas .",
    "we study a one dimensional , repulsive , weakly interacting bose gas confined in a harmonic trap .",
    "excellent realizations of such a system are available @xcite thus , our hamiltonian of the one dimensional bose gas has a form : @xmath5 the hamiltonian is a sum of the single particle oscillator energy with mass @xmath6 and angular frequency @xmath7 and a conventional contact interaction with the coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "a convenient base is provided by the eigenstates of the harmonic oscillators @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 annihilates an atom in the @xmath12-th harmonic oscillator state .",
    "the classical field approximation consists in replacing the creation and annihilation operators by classical complex amplitudes : @xmath13 in @xcite we have shown , that probabilistic properties of the condensate for one dimensional ideal bose gas in a harmonic trap are perfectly reproduced by the classical fields approximation provided the number of degrees of freedom is kept finite with the last retained state chosen as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the absolute temperature and @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this suggests the classical fields approach may be used also for the weakly interacting gas @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the energy of a given configuration of the field is given as : @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the quartic polynomial in the amplitudes @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the probability distribution of a given configuration of the classical field according to the canonical ensemble is : @xmath20 \\label{eqn : probability}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the classical partition function for @xmath22 atoms at temperature @xmath15 .",
    "we need to generate this probability distribution with a set of the amplitudes subject to the constraint given by the fixed number of particles : @xmath23 the best known monte carlo realization of this distribution is given by the metropolis algorithm @xcite .",
    "before we turn to the results there are two important remarks : for interacting atoms the condensate wave function is no longer the empty harmonic potential ground state , thus its occupation is not @xmath24 . instead",
    ", following @xcite , the identification of the condensate requires a diagonalization of the single particle density matrix , which in our harmonic oscillator representation is : @xmath25 where the mean value is taken with the probability distribution and the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue is the condensate .",
    "the other remark concerns the cut - off condition . for the interacting gas",
    "we need a higher cut - off . we know that the repulsive gas at zero temperature is broader then the ground state of the harmonic potential thus its wave function needs higher energy terms . remembering that in the bogolubov approximation the quasiparticle excitations have energies counted not from zero but from the chemical potential @xmath26 we postulate the modification of the cut - off condition in the form : @xmath27 which will be independently verified in the next section .",
    "equipped with the numerical scheme described in some detail in the preceding section we turn now to the discussion of results .",
    "we begin with statistical properties of the condensate .",
    "the only earlier results were obtained with the help of the time dependent methods @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the first results obtained with the methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics . in our classical fields approximation , however , effects of quantum fluctuations , such as quantum depletion are missing . throughout this paper",
    "we use the oscillator units of position , energy and temperature : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 respectively .",
    "all calculations are performed for @xmath31 atoms .",
    "our main parameter is just the coupling constant @xmath8  all simulations are done for @xmath32 ( what corresponds to the @xmath33rb in our units ) and @xmath34 . as a reference point",
    "we always have the ideal gas case .",
    "for the ideal gas we have an exact probability distribution of the number of uncondensed atoms @xmath35 ( thus with remaining @xmath36 in the condensate ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "we also have its best classical fields approximation : @xmath39 with the cut - off parameter @xmath40 chosen according to and the monte carlo representation of the classical distribution .",
    "the detailed derivation of is given in the appendix .    from these , coinciding reference points we are then departing to the largely unchartered territory of the interacting gas .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape ] we plot the zero temperature spatial distribution of the condensate for several values of the coupling . note the standard broadening of the condensate wave function . at this point",
    "our method merely seeks the minimum of the classical energy functional satisfying the constraint .",
    "in fact this is nearly the same as the ground state of the gross - pitaevskii equation conveniently computed by the imaginary time propagation .",
    "next we look at the mean number of condensed atoms as a function of temperature , fig [ fig : n0 ] . in the 1d case",
    "this number decreases gradually even in @xmath41 limit .",
    "as it should be , the exact ideal gas result ( solid , red online ) is reproduced very well by the corresponding classical field monte carlo results ( green crosses ) .",
    "note that for a stronger coupling the depletion of the condensate with growing temperature becomes very rapid .",
    "this plot provides a direct test of our proposed modification of the cut - off condition for the interacting gas .",
    "the shift of the cut - off energy by the chemical potential is the smallest increase that guaranties @xmath42 { } 1 $ ] and in the same time gives correct zero temperature condensate wave function .",
    "next let us look at fluctuations .",
    "it is the fluctuations that were ensemble dependent for the ideal gas . in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0fluct ] we plot the variance of the condensate occupation probability distribution for the interacting gas again compared to the ideal gas canonical result ( solid , red online ) .",
    "we see the shift of the curve towards lower temperatures . as for all finite systems , it is not easy to define a characteristic cross - over temperature based on the depletion plots as in fig .",
    "[ fig : n0 ] .",
    "it is natural to define such a cross - over characteristic temperature as the one corresponding to the maximum variance @xcite .",
    "of course our monte carlo method gives also access to the full probability distribution of the occupation of the condensate state . for @xmath43 this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nexc ] .",
    "in spite of all the theoretical effort , until now there are no experimental measurements of the temperature dependent statistical properties of the condensate .",
    "the relative fluctuations are significant only for small samples of several hundred atoms .",
    "sufficiently precise determination of the condensate fraction with nearly perfect control of the total number of trapped atoms remains a challenge .",
    "however , measured indirectly were temperature dependent coherence properties of nearly 1d bose gas @xcite and also local density fluctuations of such a gas @xcite .",
    "those are of course , also accessible to us .",
    "there are two remarks in order : first , our cut - off was optimized to reproduce statistics of the condensate .",
    "this way it is not optimized for the thermal atoms . in fact , as was shown in @xcite , it overestimates the population of thermal modes .",
    "it must be so since in the classical field approximation all atoms are distributed over a finite number of low - lying states instead of the infinite number of them . thus , particularly at high temperatures , when most atoms are thermal , we expect a deteriorating accuracy of the method .",
    "second is the problem of ordering . of course within the classical fields approximation fields",
    "do commute .",
    "thus , there is no difference between the density - density correlation function and the fourth order normally ordered correlation function : @xmath44 but at very high temperatures the last term , missing for classical fields , becomes dominant .",
    "it gives rise to what experimenters call the shot noise .",
    "classical fields can not possibly reproduce this contribution unless it would be introduced by hand .",
    "the most interesting property of the lowest order correlation function for the 1d bose gas has been first noted in @xcite . unlike in 3d",
    ", the coherence length in 1d gas may be shorter than the length of the condensate .",
    "this phenomenon is called a quasicondensate . in the experiment @xcite",
    "it has been observed indirectly : upon expansion , quasicondensate s phase fluctuations turn into density fluctuations that can be directly observed in standard absorptive imaging .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1shape ] we show the comparison of the condensate wave - function and the lowest order correlation function @xmath45 in the quasicondensate regime .",
    "more quantitative analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corl ] . here",
    "we vary the temperature confronting the length of the condensate with the correlation length for our two standard coupling constants .",
    "note the crossing of the two curves defining the onset of the quasicondensate .",
    "we add that the 1d ideal gas has no quasicondensation .",
    "finally , we present results for the local density fluctuations .",
    "they were measured recently in hanover @xcite and in orsay @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluct0 ] we present temperature dependence of the local density fluctuations at the center of the trap defined as @xmath46 unlike in the statistical properties of the condensate itself , even for the ideal gas there is certain difference between the exact ( solid , red online ) and the monte carlo classical fields . as mentioned above it is a result of the distorted occupation of the thermal modes in the classical fields approach .",
    "the interaction reduces the density fluctuations as predicted in @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the density fluctuations were measured _ in situ _ across a nearly one - dimensional sample versus the local density .",
    "the comparison of the ideal gas and the interacting gas of the same dependence is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctvsdens ] .",
    "it has the main qualitative properties just like in the experiment again showing the reduction of the fluctuations due to the interactions .",
    "the quantitative comparison is hard since experimental parameters of the number of particles or the temperature are known with large error bars .",
    "the authors of @xcite explored also a very high temperature regime with the density fluctuations dominated by the shot noise .",
    "this is a regime not accessible to classical fields for two related reasons : in this regime all states have a very small , fractional occupation and also classical fields are missing the quadratic term resulting from the commutator of the bose fields , term essential in the high temperature regime .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated a power of the novel computational tool to tackle the equilibrium thermodynamics of weakly interacting gas consisting of bose particles .",
    "the method , based on classical fields approximation to the full quantum theory exploits classical monte carlo technique to explore the phase space of the underlying finite dimensional classical system , for which the set of canonical variables replaces the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "we have applied the method to the 1d repulsive gas trapped in a harmonic potential calculating not only the statistical properties of the condensate but also the low - order correlation functions of the whole gas that may be directly confronted with the measurements .",
    "the authors appreciate discussions with emilia witkowska .",
    "we also acknowledge financial support of polish government funds for 2010 - 2012 .",
    "the quantum partition function in the canonical ensemble may be written as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath7 is a frequency of the harmonic trap . the kronecker delta in eq .",
    "[ aeqn : qpart ] enforces in the conservation of the total number of particles . in the classical version",
    "the sums have to be replaced with integrals @xmath49 and the kronecker s delta turns into the dirac s delta @xmath50 .",
    "thus classical counterpart of the above formula reads :          note that the expression @xmath60 is just equal to @xmath61 , and the whole sums of products can be rewritten in the simpler form : @xmath62 using the newton formula we can further simplify the partition function , getting finally : @xmath63    in the same manner we can compute the partition function for excited atoms : @xmath64 where @xmath35 is the number of atoms in all excited states . thus probability of finding exactly @xmath35 excited atoms in the sample of @xmath22 atoms at",
    "the temperature @xmath65 is equal to @xmath66"
