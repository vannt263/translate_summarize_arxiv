    "the strong interaction treats therefore fermion holes in the saturated state in a similar way as the fermions themselves in the vacuum , such that the holes also have to form gauge invariant combinations of the form of mesons and baryons .",
    "+ having this symmetry between particles at zero density and holes at saturation , makes it plausible that at half - filling , where particles and holes appear with equal densities , they indeed behave symmetrically .",
    "the same should be true for the non - phase - quenched system where the elementary excitations would be baryons with @xmath84 at zero density and holes of the form of anti - baryons with @xmath85 at saturation .",
    "again this suggests that at half - filling , where baryons and baryon - holes have equal density , we should have particle - hole symmetry .",
    "in contrast to the systems studied in solid state physics , where the lattice is physical and half - filling describes a physical state as in the fermionic hubbard model , the lattice in lqcd is jut a regulator which has to be removed ( e.g. in numerical works , by doing continuum extrapolation ) in order to extract real physics .",
    "the half - filling state of a lqcd system is therefore just an unphysical lattice artifact and should be of no relevance for the continuum physics . +",
    "as long as we are running simulations sufficiently far away from the continuum limit ( such that the maximal fermion density on the lattice ( in physical units ) is far below the density where the pauli exclusion principle would become important in the continuum ) , the first appearance of a minimum in the average sign as a function of increasing chemical potential ( or as a function of increasing isospin number density ) as shown in figure [ fig : avsign ] , indicates the point where lattice artifacts start to become dominant .",
    "this becomes clear by noting that the average sign is a measure for the overlap between a system with a quark chemical potential and the corresponding phase - quenched system ( with an isospin instead of a quark chemical potential ) .",
    "as the right - hand side of figure [ fig : avsign ] shows , the average sign drops dramatically as soon as the isospin density becomes non - zero , reflecting the fact that a pion condensate develops in the isospin system , leading to a ground state which is rather different from that of the corresponding system with a quark chemical potential . the fact that the overlap between the two systems starts to increase again with increasing @xmath2 ( i.e. that the average sign starts to increase again ) indicates , that the influence of the pauli exclusion principle starts to become dominant on the lattice : the fact that the quark chemical potential favors the @xmath86 and @xmath87 quarks , while the isospin chemical potential favors @xmath86 and @xmath88 , starts to become less important as for example the `` @xmath87-hole '' in the system with the quark chemical potential starts to play the role of the @xmath88 in the isospin system and vice versa .",
    "this happens at densities significantly below half - filling , and measurements of observables taken at larger densities should be considered with caution .",
    "in the following section we will analyze the half - filling point of lqcd in the heavy - dense limit and at strong coupling . these simplifications will allow us to understand the origin of the properties of the half - filling point .",
    "the goal of this section is to obtain an expression for the partition function in the so - called _ heavy - dense _ approximation at strong coupling , which can be integrated analytically .",
    "the heavy - dense approximation usually consists of taking the limit @xmath89 , @xmath90 , keeping @xmath91 finite while terms proportional to just @xmath11 or @xmath92 vanish . in our case",
    ", it would be more appropriate to call it the _ static quark _",
    "limit , as we will just drop the spatial hopping terms from the dirac operator , but not the one corresponding to backward hopping in time , which is proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting fermion determinant is well - known as the leading term in the _ spatial hopping _ expansion that was already used in @xcite to derive an effective model for qcd or in @xcite to obtain a holomorphic action for complex langevin simulations of lqcd .",

    "<S> we then add in a first step an effective polyakov loop gauge action ( which reproduces the leading terms in the character expansion of the wilson gauge action ) to the heavy - dense partition function and try to analyze how some of the properties of the half - filling point change when leaving the strong coupling limit . in a second step , </S>",
