    "now we prove that @xmath8 has exactly two nodal domains . by contradiction",

    "moreover , the critical points of @xmath124 on @xmath320 are the critical points of @xmath124 in @xmath70 .",
    "thus , @xmath322 is a ground state solution of problem ( 1.4 ) .    from theorem 1.1",
    ", we know that problem ( 1.4 ) has a least energy sign - changing solution @xmath8 which changes sign only once .",
