    "multiphoton interference is a nonclassical effect widely utilized in optical realizations of quantum - enhanced technologies @xcite and testing foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "high visibility of multiphoton interference depends critically on the absence of distinguishing information between the interfering photons @xcite . while early experiments relied on spatial and spectral filtering to fulfill this requirement , a great deal of effort is currently being expended on the development of sources that guarantee suitable characteristics of the collected photons already at the production stage .",
    "such sources can offer substantially higher brightness , compatibility with integrated optics circuits , and strong photon number correlations , the last feature needed for example in device - independent quantum cryptography and randomness generation @xcite",
    ".    a promising route to photon sources with well - defined , controllable characteristics is based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion in @xmath3 nonlinear waveguides @xcite .",
    "compared to bulk crystals , the phase matching conditions that define the nonlinear process in a waveguide assume a different form owing to the discreteness of transverse spatial modes propagating through the structure @xcite .",

    "in particular , generation of spatially pure photon pairs in a multimode waveguide has been recently reported in @xcite , with a high degree of spatial coherence verified via a heralded photon counting measurement of the beam quality factors based on free - space diffraction .",
    "single spatial modes for the generated photons were selected by exploiting the effects of intermodal dispersion in the down - conversion process .",

    "measurements performed in two setups : a hong - ou - mandel interferometer @xcite in the common - path configuration @xcite and a shih - alley source of polarization entanglement @xcite yield visibilities consistently exceeding @xmath0 . remarkably , these values have been obtained without any spatial filtering of the generated photons , and only a coarse selection of their spectral range .",
    "these results provide a compelling verification of the high - quality modal characteristics of the generated photons , paving way towards employing them in more complex multiphoton interference experiments .",

    "we begin by reviewing the technique to control the spatial characteristics of photon pairs generated in a multimode nonlinear waveguide and discussing the operation of the source that ensures high - visibility two - photon interference .",
    "the waveguide is chosen to realize a type - ii down - conversion process in which a pump photon @xmath4 is converted into a pair of orthogonally polarized photons @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the basic object in our analysis is the phase matching function , which in the quantum picture of parametric down - conversion is interpreted as the probability amplitude that a pair of photons with wavelengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be generated from a pump photon with the wavelength defined by energy conservation . while in a bulk medium",
    "the phase matching function depends also on continuous spatial degrees of freedom of the photons taking part in the process , parameterized for example with transverse wave vectors @xcite , in the case of a multimode waveguide the function depends on the specific triplet of spatial modes of the photons @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 involved in the process .",

    "( b ) the joint and marginal spectra of the generated photon pairs .",
    "application of coarse spectral filtering represented by dashed lines allows one to select the spectral region where both the photons are generated in the fundamental waveguide modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : phmatch],width=453 ]    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phmatch](a ) , intermodal dispersion between waveguide modes makes the phase matching condition satisfied in general at different regions of the plane spanned by the wavelengths @xmath7 and @xmath8 , resulting in a series of bands whose width is inversely proportional to the waveguide length . in particular ,",
    "if the pump is prepared in the fundamental waveguide mode @xmath11 , then the phase matching function for generating down - converted photons in fundamental modes @xmath9 and @xmath10 is separated from processes involving higher - order @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 modes , provided that the waveguide is long enough to sufficiently narrow the relevant bands .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the 1  mm long structure in our experiment , which was simulated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phmatch](a ) .",
    "it needs to be stressed that this scheme relies critically on the pump beam prepared in the fundamental spatial mode : coupling the pump into modes other than @xmath11 generates contributions from phase matching bands involving higher - order spatial modes for @xmath5 and @xmath6 photons that overlap spectrally with the desired @xmath12 band .",
    "if a cw pump is employed to induce the down - conversion process , the wavelengths of the down - converted photons must satisfy the constraint of constant total energy , which is symmetric with respect to swapping @xmath7 and @xmath8 and for the wavelength range depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phmatch](a ) becomes a nearly straight line tilted at 45@xmath13 with respect to the graph axes .",
    "in contrast , the slope of the phase matching bands is noticeably different , as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 photons are generated in the type - ii process and they propagate as extraordinary and ordinary rays .",
    "consequently , pairs of photons are produced for combinations of wavelengths that form a set of islands , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phmatch](b ) , located at crossings of the energy conservation line with phase matching bands .",
    "the island corresponding to the process @xmath12 can be separated from other processes by coarse spectral filtering of one or both of the generated photons .",
    "it is worth noting that overlap may occur between islands corresponding to generation of photon pairs in higher - order spatial modes owing to approximate mode degeneracy with respect to their propagation constants .",
    "while the above scheme ensures generation of photons in fundamental spatial modes , two - photon interference requires also spectral indistinguishability within the produced pairs .",
    "this condition is not satisfied automatically , as the separation between the spectra of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 photons will vary with the wavelength of the pump photons , which shifts the energy conservation line in the diagonal direction of fig .  [",
    "fig : phmatch](a ) .",
    "however , the graph indicates that for a suitable pump wavelength the regime of spectral degeneracy should be achievable .",
    "because our numerical simulation of the waveguide is sensitive to details of the actual refractive index profile , this regime of operation needs to be identified by experimental means .",
    "we found that a suitable procedure , described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , was to measure the individual photon spectra in the heralded regime and to carefully tune the pump wavelength until the spectral profiles of @xmath5 and @xmath6 photons were matched within the resolution of the measuring apparatus .",
