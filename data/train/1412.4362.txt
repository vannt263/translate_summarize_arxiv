    "quantum gravity ( qg ) is the research in theoretical physics that seeks a consistent quantum theory of gravity .",
    "it is considered by many as the open problem of paramount importance in fundamental physics , as its task is to unify quantum mechanics ( more specifically , quantum field theory , qft ) and general relativity ( gr ) , which are the two greatest theories discovered in the twentieth century and have become the cornerstones of modern physics .",
    "ever since it was recognized that the gravitational field needs to be quantized , the quest for a satisfactory quantum description of spacetime has never stopped , and gradually qg has grown into a vast area of research along many different paths with various doctrines .",
    "the two most developed approaches are string theory ( see [ ch : chernoff ] and references therein ) and loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "other directions include causal sets , dynamical triangulation , emergent gravity , @xmath0 space theory , noncommutative geometry , supergravity , thermogravity , twistor theory , and many more .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for surveys and more references on different theories of qg . )    among other approaches , the strength of lqg is that it provides a compelling description of quantum spacetime in a nonperturbative , background - independent fashion .",
    "( on the other hand , see chaps .",
    "[ ch : kim ] and [ ch : woodard ] for the perturbative approach of qg . )",
    "the beauty lies in its faithful attempt to establish a conceptual framework that consolidates the apparently conflicting tenets of qft and gr .",
    "lqg deliberately adopts the `` minimalist '' approach in the sense that it focuses solely on the search for a consistent quantum theory of gravity without requiring any extraordinary ingredients such as extra dimensions , supersymmetry , and so on ( although many of these can be incorporated compatibly ) . unlike string theory ,",
    "the aim of which is much more ambitious , lqg does not intend to address the unification problem of finding a `` theory of everything '' in which all forces , including gravity , are unified .",
    "the central problem confronted by lqg simply is : what is the consistent quantum field theory of which the low - energy limit is classical gr , if it exists after all ?",
    "having been developed about 25 years ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for its history and current status ) , lqg has faced many challenges and achieved encouraging progress .",
    "many long - standing open problems within the approach have been solved , and lqg now provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for qg .",
    "one of the main results is the discovery that the spectra of area and volume are discrete and the corresponding quantum states , called _ spin networks _ , reveal the microscopic structure of space that is granular in planck scale .",
    "the discreteness of space is not postulated _ ad hoc _ but a direct consequence of quantization in the same nature as the discrete levels of energy in an atom .",
    "because of the discreteness , lqg enables one to derive the bekenstein - hawking entropy of black holes from first principles , offering a microscopic explanation of its proportionality to the area of the horizon .",
    "( also see [ ch : carlip ] for other aspects of black hole thermodynamics . ) furthermore , the construction of lqg relies heavily on diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "once the gauge degrees of diffeomorphism are factored away , the resulting quantum states , called _ s - knots _ , are not to be interpreted as quantum excitations _ on _ a space but , rather , _ of _ the space itself , because any external reference to localization of quantum states becomes irrelevant and only their contiguous relation remains significant . in terms of this relational structure ,",
    "lqg profoundly manifests _",
    "background independence_the key principle of classical gr  in the context of qft . with many successes",
    "achieved , the major weakness of lqg is in our limited understanding about its quantum dynamics and low - energy physics , but these two aspects have been intensively investigated and some promising solutions have emerged .",
    "lqg is closely related to the spin foam theory , an alternative approach of qg . while lqg is based on the canonical ( hamiltonian ) formalism , the spin foam theory can be viewed as the covariant ( sun - over - histories ) approach of lqg .",
    "the history of a spin network ( more precisely , an s - knot ) evolving over time is called a _ spin foam _ , which represents a quantized spacetime in the same sense that a spin network represents a quantized space .",
    "the transition amplitude is given by a discrete version of path integral , which is the sum , with proper weight factors , over all possible spin foams sending the initial spin network to the final one .",
    "extensive research on the spin foam theory has made rapid advances , suggesting that a specific class of spin foam models might provide a covariant definition of the lqg dynamics .",
    "applying principles of lqg to cosmological settings , one obtains loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) .",
    "lqc is a symmetry - reduced model of lqg with only a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the simplification of symmetry reduction makes possible a detailed investigation on the ramifications of loop quantum effects , many of which remain obscure in the full theory of lqg",
    ". one of the striking results of lqc is that the big bang singularity is resolved by the loop quantum effects and replaced by a _ quantum bounce _ , which bridges the present universe with a preexistent one .",
    "the bouncing scenario opens up a new paradigm of cosmology .",
    "research of lqc has led to many successes and represents a very active research field in recent years .",
    "there are many books and review articles available on lqg@xcite , the spin foam theory@xcite , and lqc@xcite .",
    "this article serves as an `` in - a - nutshell '' yet self - contained introductory review on lqg .",
    "it is centered on the canonical formulation of lqg with moderate details but covers the spin foam theory , black hole thermodynamics , and lqc only very briefly .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "after a quick review on the problems of qg in , the main topic of canonical approach of lqg is presented from to in a logically orderly fashion .",
    "additionally , the spin foam theory , black hole thermodynamics , and lqc are briefly described in secs .",
    "[ sec : spin foam theory ] , [ sec : black hole thermodynamics ] , and [ sec : lqc ] , respectively . finally , outlines the current directions and open issues .    a large part of this article is heavily based on refs .",
    "@xcite without delving into all technicalities .",
    "conventions are given as follows .",
    "the signature of the spacetime metric @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 .",
    "the greek letters in lower case are used for the coordinates of the 4-dimensional spacetime manifold , while the latin letters in lower case starting @xmath3 are for the coordinates of the 3-dimensional space manifold .",
    "the latin letters in upper case starting @xmath4 are used for the 4-dimensional `` internal space '' ( the vector space on which the lorentz group @xmath5 is represented ) , while the latin letters in lower case starting @xmath6 are for the 3-dimensional internal space ( the vector space on which @xmath7 , the covering group of @xmath8 , is represented ) . in case the euclidean gr , in place of the lorentzain gr , the metric signature is given by @xmath9 and the lorentz group @xmath5 is replaced by the euclidean rotational group @xmath10 .",
    "the speed of light is set to @xmath11 , but we keep the ( reduced ) planck constant @xmath12 and the gravitational constant @xmath13 explicit .      despite the fact that enormous efforts in various approaches have been devoted for qg , it remains the holy grail of theocratical physics . in the section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the conceptual problems in qg .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for full elaboration . )",
    "the very first question about qg is : why do we even bother to quantize gravity at all ?",
    "apart from many aesthetic considerations for an elegant unification of known fundamental physics , the logical necessity of a quantum description of gravity follows from the conflicts between the two fundamental theories of gr and qft .",
    "the fundamental theories collide in the classical einstein field equation @xmath14 which relates the dynamics of nongravitational matter ( in terms of @xmath15 ) described by the theory of qft to the dynamics of geometry ( in terms of @xmath16 ) described by the theory of gr .",
    "note that the metric @xmath16 enters the definition of the energy - momentum tensor via @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the action ) and that qft is defined only on a given ( flat or curved ) background .",
    "as matter fields are quantized in qft , the only way to make sense of without quantizing @xmath16 is to start with a given background @xmath19 and replace the right - hand side with the expectation value @xmath20 .",
    "once we solve the classical field @xmath16 by this prescription , we treat the solution as the new background and iterate the procedure .",
    "however , the iteration is not guaranteed to yield convergent solutions and thus leads to inconsistency .",
    "in fact , one can not consistently couple a classical system to a quantum one@xcite , even though qft in curved spacetime provides an adequate effective theory in low - energy regime .",
    "the conflicts force one to quantize both geometry and matter fields simultaneously or to invoke other more radical modifications .",
    "what after all are the difficulties that prevent one from quantizing both geometry and matter easily at the same time ?",
    "it turns out the difficulties lie at the very contradictory difference between the fundamental principles of gr and qft .    in gr ,",
    "spacetime is dynamical as well as matter fields .",
    "matter and geometry are essentially on the equal footing in this regard . in qft , by contrast , all dynamical variables are quantized except spacetime .",
    "spacetime is treated as a given fixed background , which parameterizes all dynamical fields and provides the _ a priori _ causal structure needed for field quantization .",
    "therefore , one encounters the stark paradox when joining gr and qft together .",
    "there are various approaches trying to circumvent the paradox , differing on which features of gr and qft are viewed as fundamental and unchangeable and which features as inessential and modifiable , as surveyed in refs .",
    "@xcite .      in conventional qft ,",
    "dynamics of dynamical fields takes place on the `` stage '' of a fixed spacetime with given metric . by analogy ,",
    "dynamical fields are animals that roam around and chase one another upon the stage of an island of spacetime .",
    "gr , on the other hand , has taught us a very different paradigm of _ background independence _ , according to which spacetime is itself a dynamical entity ( gravitational field ) in many respects the same as other nongravitational entities .",
    "that said , physical entities , both gravitational and nongravitational , are not residing and moving in spacetime but , rather , they reside and move on top of one another . in the words of rovelli s",
    "metaphor@xcite :  it is as if we had observed in the ocean many animals living on an island : animals on the island",
    ". then we discover that the island itself is in fact a great whale .",
    "so the animals are no longer on the island , just animals on animals . \"    among various theories of qg , lqg is special in the sense that it reveres the paradigm of background independence earnestly and aims to formulate a nonconventional qft of gr in genuine conformity with the paradigm , essentially in a nonperturbative fashion , so as to reconcile the aforementioned paradox .",
    "this of course is a very challenging task and the first step is to begin with the `` proper '' mathematical framework , which turns out to be the canonical description of connection dynamics of gr in terms of _ ashtekar connection_. the shift from metric to ashtekar connection opens the possibility of employing nonperturbative techniques in gauge theories ( especially , lattice gauge theories ) to qg .",
    "classical gr is usually presented as _",
    "geometrodynamics _ , i.e. , a dynamical theory of metrics , but it can also be recast as _ connection dynamics _ ,",
    "i.e. , a dynamical theory of connections .",
    "the merit of this reformulation is to cast gr in a language closer to that of gauge theories , for which quantization is better understood . in this section ,",
    "we present a brief introduction to connection theories of gr , largely excerpted from sec .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , and address some remarks in . for introductory purpose , we will focus only on the gravitational part of the action and phase space . for inclusion of matter and",
    "the cosmological constant , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ( also see ) ; for extension to supergravity and other spacetime dimensions , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ( also see ) .",
    "the most widely known formulation of classical gr is the dynamical theory of metric @xmath16 , which is based on the riemannian geometry and governed by the einstein - hilbert action @xmath21=\\frac{1}{16\\pi",
    "g}\\int d^4x \\sqrt{{{\\left|{g}\\right|}}}\\,r,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the ricci scalar and @xmath23 is the determinant of @xmath16 .",
    "classical gr also admits many other formulations , which are equivalent to one another to various extent .    in the palatini formulation@xcite based on the riemann - cartan geometry , instead of @xmath16 ,",
    "the basic gravitational variables are taken to be the coframe field @xmath24 , which gives the orthonormal cotetrad ( or vierbein ) , and the @xmath25-valued connection 1-form field @xmath26 , which corresponds to the gauge group @xmath5 of local lorentz transformation .",
    "the palatini action is given by @xmath27=\\frac{1}{32\\pi g}\\int \\epsilon_{ijkl}e^i\\wedge e^j\\wedge\\omega^{kl},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the curvature of the connection @xmath26 .",
    "the coframe @xmath24 determines the spacetime metric via @xmath29 meanwhile , the connection @xmath26 is completely determined by the coframe via @xmath30 which is the equation of motion obtained by varying the palatini action with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "as far as equations of motion are concerned , the palatini action , imposed by , reduces to the familiar einstein - hilbert action .",
    "thus , these two actions lead to the same theory at least at the classical level .",
    "it is tedious yet straightforward to perform the legendre transform on the palatini action to obtain the hamiltonian theory@xcite , but the resulting theory has certain second - class constraints .",
    "when the second - class constraints are solved , one is led to the standard hamiltonian description of geometrodynamics ( in terms of cotriads ) and thus loses all reference to connection dynamics ; meanwhile , the form of geometrodynamics is rather complicated and seems insurmountable for quantum theory .",
    "this problem can be avoided by modifying the palatini action with holst s augmentation@xcite as @xmath32=\\frac{1}{32\\pi g}\\int \\epsilon_{ijkl}e^i\\wedge e^j\\wedge\\omega^{kl } -\\frac{1}{16\\pi g\\gamma}\\int e^i\\wedge e^j\\wedge\\omega_{ij},\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is an arbitrary but fixed number , called the _ barbero - immirzi _ parameter .",
    "the celebrated feature is that this augmentation does not change the equations of motion of .",
    "inclusion of holst s modification renders it more elegant to perform the legendre transform in the sense that all constraints are first class ( as we will see shortly ) and consequently makes the quantum theory founded on the hamiltonian description more manageable as significance of connection dynamics is retained .",
    "( while different numerical values of @xmath33 yield equivalent theories at the classical level , it should be noted that , in the quantum theory , they give rise to different sectors that are not unitarily equivalent to one another as will be shown in . )    in the non - abelian gauge theory , the yang - mills action can also be augmented with a topological term called the @xmath34-term as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the field strength ( curvature ) of the yang - maills connection , @xmath37 is the hodge dual , and @xmath38 and @xmath34 are known as the coupling constant and the @xmath34-angle respectively . , different numerical values of @xmath34 yield equivalent theories at the classical level but give rise to inequivalent @xmath34-sectors in the quantum theory . ]",
    "it is noticeable that bears close resemblance to .",
    "whether this intriguing resemblance carries any profound meaning arouses a lot of curiosity .",
    "lqg , in particular , exploits the resemblance to the extent that we can adopt the nonperturbative techniques ( such as the quantization scheme in terms of wilson loops ) well developed in the context of gauge theories .",
    "we have reformulated the classical theory of gr in a fashion very close to non - abelian gauge theories . prior to quantizing the theory , we have to take a further step to translate the covariant description into the canonical ( or hamiltonian ) description in order to apply the standard scheme of _ equal - time quantization _ used in qft .",
    "first , we apply the adm foliation , which foliates the 4-dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath39 into a family of spacelike surfaces ( called `` leaves '' ) @xmath40 , labelled by a time coordinate @xmath41 and with spatial coordinates on each slice given by @xmath42 . under the adm foliation ,",

    "indeed , it would be theoretically more compelling if one could construct the quantum theory based on the generic lagrangian , but inclusion of any terms in the second line unfortunately makes the constraints in the canonical description very complicated and no longer first class , rendering the hamiltonian formulation inadequate for quantization .",
    "the fact that the palatini - holst action _ per se _ is privileged seems to suggest that , even with real @xmath33 , the @xmath116 structure of the complex lorentz algebra still plays a profound role in qg ( as advocated by the twistor theory and the @xmath0 space theory ) , although its direct relevance remains obscure.accordingly , lqg is most naturally constructed for 4-dimensional spacetime .",

    "lqg nevertheless takes the palatini - holst action ( with or without matter ) as the starting point , adopting the attitude that the four - fermion interaction is very likely to be real on account of the fact that the effect of gravity on fermions is very difficult to measure .",

    "the geometrical interpretation of the action of the scalar constraint operator becomes more transparent , which should help to elucidate the quantum dynamics and the low - energy physics .",
    "furthermore , as the requirement of being anomaly - free at the off - shell level is supposed to impose more restrictions on permissible regulators , the infinite multitude of quantization ambiguities could be enormously reduced or even uniquely fixed .",
    "the canonical ( hamiltonian ) formalism of lqg and the covariant ( sum - over - histories ) formalism of the spin foam theory are closely related to each other , yet up to now spin foam models have not been systematically derived from the standard canonical theory of lqg . over the past years",

    "all lead to the overlapped results , perhaps it is the time to `` leave the ladder behind '' ( as advocated in ref .",

    "the kinematics of covariant lqg is well defined and background independent , and the dynamics of it is given in terms of a simple vertex function , largely determined by locality , diffeomorphism invariance , and local lorentz invariance .    in the framework of covariant lqg , transition amplitudes for given boundary states can be computed explicitly and then compared with the classical theory by the techniques of _ holomorphic coherent states _ ( see and references therein ) .",
    "particularly , the 2-point function of the euclidean theory over a flat spacetime has been computed to the first order in the vertex expansion , and has been shown to converge to the free graviton propagator of qg in the large distance limit@xcite .",

    "furthermore , if a cosmological constant term is added , the result matches the de sitter solution in the classical limit@xcite .",
    "this approach starting from the full theory of covariant lqg and then taking an approximation of the vertex and graph expansions is called `` spin foam cosmology '' . by comparison , in lqc one",

    "this pre - inflationary dynamics could yield deviations from the standard inflationary scenario and give rise to novel effects , such as a source for non - gaussianity .",

    "finite _ number by the symmetry of homogeneity ( and possibly also isotropy ) .",
    "the next simplest symmetry - reduced framework is the spherically symmetric _",
    "midisuperspace _ , in which the spherical symmetry is imposed but inhomogeneity along the radial direction is retained , thus still giving rise to a field - theoretical system of _ infinite _ degrees of freedom .",
    "ashtekar s formalism for spherically symmetric midisuperspaces and its loop quantization have been studied and developed with various degrees of rigor@xcite .",
    "the theory of spherically symmetric loop gravity provides an arena for testing important issues that are too difficult in the full theory of lqg and trivialized in minisuperspace ( lqc ) models .",
    "particularly , the @xmath7 internal gauge is reduced to @xmath960 ) and the 3-dimensional diffeomorphism is reduced to 1-dimensional diffeomorphism ( in the radial direction ) , making the constraint algebra much simpler yet nontrivial . the framework of spherically symmetric loop gravity can be used to study loop quantum geometry of spherically symmetric black holes ( schwarzschild black hole , spherical gravitational collapse , etc . ) .",
    "it is indicated that in the resulting quantum spacetime the black hole singularity is avoided@xcite , suggesting that the information loss problem could be resolved accordingly .",
    "one of the key insights obtained in lqc is that the quantum geometry of lqg gives rise to _ opposing _ quantum gravitational force , which becomes appreciable when the matter density comes close to the planck scale density @xmath961 .",
    "based on the insight , recently , a new possible scenario of collapsing black holes has been suggested@xcite : the gravitational collapse of a star does not lead to a singularity but to the quantum gravitational phase called a `` planck star '' , where the very huge gravitational attraction is counterbalanced by the opposing quantum force .",
    "accordingly , a black hole hides a core of a planck star , which is of the planck scale density but can be much larger than the planck scale size ( depending on the initial mass of the collapsing star ) .",
    "as the black hole evaporates , the core remembers the initial mass and the final explosion can occur at macroscopic scale , thus providing a possible mechanism for recovery of information loss .",
    "more interestingly , the objects of planck stars could produce detectable signals of quantum gravitational origin@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the macroscopic remnant can develop into a white hole . as shown in a recent paper ref .",
    "@xcite , there is indeed a classical metric that satisfies the einstein field equation outside a finite spacetime region where matter collapses into a black hole and then emerges from a white hole . therefore , a black hole can quantum - tunnel into a white hole in the similar fashion that the wave packet representing a collapsing universe tunnels into a wave packet representing an expanding universe in lqc .",
    "a distant observer thus sees a dimming star , after a very long time , reemerge and burst out matter  a phenomenon called `` black hole fireworks '' . under the scenario of black hole fireworks , the arguments over the information paradox",
    "have to be drastically revised .",
    "it is widely expected that qg , once fully developed , should resolve several important problems in qg , particularly the singularity problem and the black hole information paradox .",
    "as both the cosmological and black hole singularities are indicated to be resolved by the lqg effects , it is strongly suggested that the information lost in the process of black hole evaporation should be recovered in a singularity - free scenario . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was analyzed in detail for 2-dimensional black holes that quantum geometry effects indeed recover the information loss , primarily because the black hole singularity is resolved and consequently the quantum spacetime is sufficiently larger than the classical counterpart . for 4-dimensional collapsing black holes , the aforementioned scenarios of planck stars and black hole fireworks in particular suggest a similar mechanism for information recovery .    the model of ref .",
    "@xcite provides a concrete example of avoiding the information loss problem under the `` remnant scenario '' , in which black hole evaporation stops at some point , leaving a black hole remnant that is correlated with the hawking radiation and allowing the combined state to remain pure .",
    "the remnant scenario generally implies the existence of a very long - lived remnant , which , unfortunately , may cause other problems ( e.g.  the problem of infinite remnant production@xcite ) .    meanwhile , a recent paper@xcite investigated an example from lqg in which the singularity problem is solved but the information loss problem is made worse .",
    "it was argued that the aggravated information loss problem is likely to be a generic feature of lqg , therefore putting considerable conceptual pressure on the theory of lqg .",
    "the information loss problem has been around for a long time .",
    "there is still no consensus over how the problem is to be resolved and it remains one of the focal points in the research of qg ( see sec .",
    "10 of [ ch : carlip ] for more discussions ) .",
    "a legitimate quantum theory of gravity must make unambiguous predictions that in principle can be empirically tested by experiments or observations .",
    "contrary to popular opinion , lqg does make definite predictions .",
    "for example , any measured physical area ( such as the total cross - section of a scattering process ) must be given by the discrete spectrum of area .",
    "( also see ref .",
    "@xcite for the possible effects of angle quantization on scattering . )",
    "the true problem is that these predictions demand experiments or observations probing the planck scale , which is believed to be far out of current reach .",
    "the impasse could be overcome soon , as the planckian physics may not be completely unreachable after all by present and near - future technology .",
    "as mentioned earlier , loop quantum effects in the pre - inflationary era could give rise to sufficient deviations from the standard inflationary scenario .",
    "some research works have attempted to reveal possible observable footprints of these effects on the cosmic microwave background along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite .      additionally , while the lorentz invariance can be made manifest both in lqg and in the spin foam theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , many other models suggest violation of lorentz invariance in the deep planck regime , which will modify the lorentzian energy - momentum dispersion relation at lower - energy scale . observations of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays  the most energetic particles ever observed  have thus far put strong constraints on deviations from the lorentzian dispersion relation .",
    "future investigation with improved precision will either impose even stronger constraints or unveil breakdown of the lorentz invariance , thus enabling theorists to discriminate between different models of lqg and the spin foam theory .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for more discussions .",
    "it is a celebrated virtue that lqg does not require any hypothetical ingredients , yet it has always been desirable to incorporate supersymmetry and extra dimensions at one s disposal for the sake of both theoretical interest and comparison with other qg approaches ( string theory in particular ) .",
    "early attempts can be found e.g.  in refs .",
    "recently , a series of papers@xcite have been devoted to rigorous formulation of the loop quantum theory for _ supergravity _ and for _ all dimensions_. some progress has been made toward calculating black hole entropy from loop quantum theory in higher dimensions@xcite .",
