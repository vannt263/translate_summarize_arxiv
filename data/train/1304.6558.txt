    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    searches for meson - nuclear bound states have focused on @xmath15 and @xmath5 mesons , motivated by a general theoretical consensus that the near - threshold @xmath16 and @xmath1 attraction generated by the @xmath0-wave resonances @xmath17 and @xmath4 , respectively , translates into sufficiently attractive @xmath15-nucleus and @xmath5-nucleus interactions . a corollary of this resonance dominance is a strong energy dependence of the underlying @xmath16 and @xmath1 interactions .",
    "here we apply the lessons gained by handling the strong energy dependence of the near - threshold @xmath16 interaction in @xmath15-nuclear calculations @xcite to @xmath5-nuclear bound - state calculations .",
    "early calculations by haider and liu @xcite predicted @xmath5-nuclear bound states beginning with nuclear mass number @xmath18 . in these , as well as in a follow - up calculation",
    "@xcite , a fairly weak @xmath1 attraction input was used , with re@xmath19  fm , where @xmath20 is the @xmath1 scattering length .",
    "several versions of coupled - channels chiral models @xcite give similar values as well , whereas other models , particularly those using @xmath2-matrix methods to fit @xmath21 and @xmath22 reaction data in the @xmath4 resonance region , e.g. @xcite , yield considerably stronger @xmath1 attraction with values of re@xmath23  fm .",
    ", it is constrained by @xmath24 cross - section measurements , with values of im@xmath250.3  fm in most theoretical analyses .",
    "] this might suggest that the onset of @xmath5-nuclear binding occurs already in the he isotopes for which strong final - state interaction precursors have been noted in proton- and deuteron - initiated @xmath5 production @xcite .",
    "a robust pattern of @xmath5-nuclear bound states could yield useful information on the size of su(3 ) flavor @xmath26 mixing and about axial u(1 ) dynamics @xcite . to date ,",
    "however , experimental searches for such bound states have been unsuccessful , e.g. the latest negative results for @xmath27he ( in photoproduction on @xmath28he @xcite ) and for @xmath29he ( in @xmath30 @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the strong model dependence of re@xmath20 , all studies of the @xmath1 system near threshold , @xmath31 mev , agree that both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath0-wave center - of - mass ( cm ) scattering amplitude @xmath32 decrease steeply in going subthreshold , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : wycech ] . since the in - medium @xmath1 interaction relevant to",
    "the evaluation of @xmath5-nuclear bound states involves subthreshold @xmath1 configurations , a procedure for going subthreshold is mandatory .",
    "previous calculations focused on shifting the energy variable of @xmath10 or its in - medium version by a fixed amount below threshold : @xmath33  mev was found in ref .",
    "@xcite to provide a good approximation to a variety of off - shell effects , whereas @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the @xmath5-nuclear binding energy , was used in refs .",
    "the latter procedure requires a self - consistent calculation to ensure that the @xmath35 argument of the input @xmath32 coincides with the @xmath35 output of the binding energy calculation .",
    "however , it was shown in our recent studies of @xmath15-nuclear dynamics @xcite that a more involved self - consistent calculation is required to correctly implement the subthreshold energy dependence , and it is this self - consistent procedure that is applied here to calculate @xmath5-nuclear bound states .",
    "this procedure results in imposing stronger constraints than ever on the onset of @xmath5-nuclear binding .",

    ".    the hl procedure is compared with ours in the second and third rows of the first ( no ) group , using free - space amplitudes .",
    "both do not produce binding for the weakest amplitude m1 and practically agree for m2 , while disagreeing significantly for the strongest gw amplitude . by comparing each of these rows with the first row where",
    "free - space _ threshold _ amplitudes are used , it is seen the effects of accounting for energy dependence are substantial in both .",
    "the gr procedure is compared with ours in the second and third rows of the second ( yes ) group , using _ in - medium _ amplitudes .",
    "the gr procedure is found to give higher binding energies and widths than ours for all amplitude models tested here , particularly for the weaker m amplitudes where it is the only one that produces a @xmath36 bound state for m1 .",
    "the overall effects in this group of accounting for energy dependence with respect to using in - medium threshold amplitudes ( first row of the yes group ) , however , are less substantial than in the preceding group , particularly for the m amplitudes .    of the three models used by us with in - medium amplitudes in table  [ tab : mg ] ( last line )",
    ", only gw provides @xmath35 which is comparable with @xmath41 deduced from the following @xmath9 mg interpretation of a peak reported by the cosy - gem collaboration @xcite : @xmath42 with a decay induced by @xmath43 . hence ,",
    "if this peak assignment to a @xmath36 state is correct , then the underlying threshold value re@xmath20 must be rather large , close to 1 fm .",
    "other procedures listed in table  [ tab : mg ] for treating the subthreshold @xmath1 energy dependence require considerably smaller values of re@xmath20 .",
    "finally , the relatively small value of width @xmath44 produced in the gw model should not be viewed as too restrictive since the total width must be larger than given in these models , owing to true @xmath45 absorption and two - pion production @xmath46 processes that are not accounted for by the models considered in the present work .",
    "in this work we have demonstrated the importance of , as well as the subtleties involved in constructing self - consistent @xmath5-nucleus optical potentials that incorporate the strong subthreshold energy dependence of the underlying @xmath1 scattering amplitude .",
    "of the three @xmath1 amplitude models studied here self - consistently , even the relatively weak attraction in model m1 with a threshold value re@xmath47  fm requires going down to about 35  mev below threshold , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : srho ] , in order to calculate reliably the @xmath5-nuclear optical potential @xmath48 at central nuclear densities .",
    "this downward energy shift exceeds by far the downward shifts @xmath49 , with @xmath50  mev encountered in the self - consistent calculations of garca - recio et al .",
    "the relatively large downward energy shifts in the present approach together with the rapid decrease of the free - space and in - medium @xmath1 amplitudes lead to smaller than ever binding energies and widths with respect to those calculated in comparable models @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath51c bound states are unlikely in models with threshold values re@xmath52  fm , and as large a value as re@xmath7  fm is required to reproduce the @xmath9 mg bound - state hint from the recent cosy - gem experiment @xcite .",
    "complementarily , for as sufficiently large values of re@xmath20 as provided by the gw amplitude model , the calculated widths come out smaller than in other calculations .",
    "a value of re@xmath53  fm is likely to yield a near - threshold @xmath29he bound state , as found here using the gw amplitude model , but it is short of binding @xmath27he . stretching the limits of optical potential usage down to these light systems",
    "is of course questionable , and corresponding few - body calculations are highly needed to resolve such issues . nevertheless , if one applies our subthreshold self - consistency scheme to @xmath5@xmath28he low - energy scattering , then a very large imaginary part that might indicate a nearby virtual state is found for the @xmath5@xmath28he cm scattering amplitude when using the gw amplitude model .",
    "this large imaginary part might be associated with the strong final - state interaction effects observed for the @xmath5@xmath28he system @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous estimates that assigned a value of re@xmath54  fm to describe such occurrence @xcite , in our self - consistent calculations it requires substantially larger values , more likely around 0.9  fm .",
