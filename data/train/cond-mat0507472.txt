    "the study of the exotic properties of cobalt oxides is an area of investigations that is currently attracting considerable attention in the research field of condensed matter physics . among the main reasons for this wide effort ,",
    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in layered two - dimensional triangular lattices of co atoms with the composition na@xmath2coo@xmath3 has certainly triggered a rapid increase of research activities on cobalt oxides .",
    "this material becomes superconducting after h@xmath3o is intercalated,@xcite opening an exciting area of investigations .",
    "the experimentally unveiled phase diagram of this compound varying the na composition has revealed the existence of several other competing tendencies : charge ordered as well as magnetic states are stabilized , in addition to superconductivity.@xcite in the related compound @xmath4 , a spin incommensurate spin - density - wave has been recently reported.@xcite the existence of such a rich phase diagram is a characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems , where complex behavior typically emerges due to the presence of competing states that have similar energies but vastly different transport and magnetic properties.@xcite    additional motivation for the study of co - oxides arises from recent experimental studies of hole - doped cobaltites in the perovskite form such as @xmath5 , where clear tendencies toward phase separation between ferromagnetic ( fm ) metallic and paramagnetic ( pm ) insulating regions have been found.@xcite this establishes an intriguing qualitative connection between co - oxides and the famous manganites that exhibit the colossal magnetoresistance , effect widely believed to originate in an analogous mixed - phase tendency exhibited by mn - oxides.@xcite in fact , a large magnetoresistance in some cobaltites has also been observed , and its origin appears related with phase competition.@xcite as a consequence , establishing the dominant ground - state tendencies of simple models for cobaltites is important to envision the possible phase mixtures that may lead to exotic behavior .    as a third motivation for the study of cobaltites , it is known that some co - based compounds have interesting thermoelectric properties . in particular",
    ", a huge thermoelectric power has been recently discovered in naco@xmath3o@xmath6 by terasaki _",
    "et al._,@xcite opening another area of investigations , with a focus on thermoelectric materials mainly with the purpose of industrial applications .    for all these reasons , the theoretical study of models for co -",
    "oxides is timely and needed in order to guide further experimental developments .",
    "ab - initio calculations have already provided important information in this context,@xcite and the inclusion of many - body effects is the natural next step .",
    "previous theoretical studies of co - based systems including coulombic repulsion have mainly focused on triangular lattices . in this context",
    ", recent monte carlo investigations unveiled the presence of magnetic correlations.@xcite fluctuation - exchange approximations also revealed tendencies toward ferromagnetism and possible triplet - pairing instabilities in a multiorbital model.@xcite several approximate studies of @xmath7-@xmath8  @xcite and single - band hubbard models  @xcite have also been presented .",
    "to understand the behavior of complex oxides , it is of particular importance the analysis of the many possible tendencies in the ground state , namely the study of the various competing states stabilized as electron density and coupling are modified . unfortunately , this task is difficult due to a lack of reliable unbiased analytical techniques . for this reason ,",
    "the first effort toward a detailed numerical analysis of models for cobaltites is presented here . instead of directly emphasizing the triangular lattice with approximate techniques or exactly studying small systems",
    ", we have preferred to perform a systematic study of a one - dimensional multiorbital hamiltonian , exploring in detail the coupling and electron density parameter space , and using computationally exact techniques .",
    "this level of accuracy is achieved through the use of reliable methods such as the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite and the lanczos technique.@xcite we envision this effort as a first step toward a systematic computational analysis of more complicated quasi - two - dimensional triangular - lattice systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the multiorbital model is introduced and many - body computational techniques used here are briefly discussed . in sec .",
    "iii , the main results are presented .",
    "these results are organized based on the observable studied : first , the @xmath1=5 phase diagram is discussed , where @xmath1 denotes the number of electron per site .",
    "then , the spin correlations are presented at several values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is followed by the charge and orbital correlations .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the main result of the paper is the clear dominance of two rather different ground states : ( 1 ) a fm state and ( 2 ) a pm state with short - range correlations .",
    "both are very robust varying couplings and densities .",
    "their higher - dimensional versions may be of relevance for present and future co - oxide experiments .",
    "in the investigation reported in this manuscript , we consider a three - orbital hubbard model , defined on a one - dimensional chain along the @xmath9-axis with @xmath10 sites .",
    "the three orbitals represent the @xmath0 orbitals of relevance for cobaltites .",
    "the model is given by @xmath11 where the index @xmath12 denotes the site of the chain , @xmath13 indicates the orbitals @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the spin projection along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "the rest of the notation is standard .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are @xmath19=@xmath20=@xmath7=@xmath21 , and zero for the other cases .",
    "these simple values for the hopping amplitudes can be easily derived from the overlap of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 orbitals between nearest - neighbor sites along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the interaction parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath8 , and @xmath27 are the standard ones for multiorbital hamiltonians , and a detailed description can be found in ref .  .",
    "these couplings are not independent , but they satisfy the well - known relations @xmath27=@xmath8 and @xmath25=@xmath26+@xmath28 , due to the reality of the wave function and the rotational symmetry in the orbital space .",
    "we investigate the model described above mainly using the dmrg technique with open boundary conditions.@xcite the finite - size algorithm is employed for sizes up to @xmath10=@xmath29 , keeping up to @xmath30=@xmath31 states per block .",
    "the truncation errors are kept around @xmath32 or smaller .",
    "the center blocks in our dmrg procedure are composed of 64 states due to the three orbitals .",
    "note that , for instance , the @xmath7-@xmath8 model has only 3 states in these center blocks . as a consequence ,",
    "keeping @xmath30=@xmath31 states per block in the @xmath0-orbital hubbard model is analogous to keeping @xmath30@xmath33@xmath34 states per block in the @xmath7-@xmath8 model .",
    "although in related investigations specific values of @xmath25 and @xmath8 for the triangular co - oxides were discussed,@xcite here we prefer to vary independently these couplings analyzing the possible ground states that are stabilized by this procedure .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath35 may change among the many interesting co - oxides , and in addition , it is important to classify the states that could be stabilized by the proper isovalent chemical doping , external fields , or perturbations .",

    "fm and pmi denote the regions with ferromagnetism and paramagnetism ( insulator ) , respectively .",
    "we also present a schematic picture of the electron configurations .",
    "afo indicates the staggered population of orbitals in the fm state .",
    "the reader should consult the text for more details , as well as the next figure . ]    in fig .  1 ,",
    "the ground - state phase diagram @xmath8 versus @xmath36=@xmath26@xmath37@xmath8 is presented . for large @xmath8 ,",
    "a fully polarized fm phase is obtained , while for small @xmath8 , a pm regime is found .",
    "this pm phase is insulating , as shown below .",
    "note that the phase diagram is obtained by comparing the energies for different sectors of the @xmath18-projection of the total spin , @xmath38 , mainly using a system of size @xmath10=6 .",
    "other values of @xmath10 are also studied , and it is observed that for @xmath10=4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 , in the pm regime the ground state has total spin 0 , 1 , 0 , and 1 , respectively , for a large set of couplings investigated . as a consequence ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the transition line separates states with the minimum and maximum total spin , without intermediate partially polarized regimes .",
    "the phase diagram we have found has similarities with that already reported by two of the authors at density @xmath1=@xmath39,@xcite in the context of spin-1 chains .    as described later ,",
    "our results for the spin - spin , charge - charge , and orbital correlations suggest , roughly , an electron distribution at short distances , as schematically presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the electron configuration in the fm phase is quite simple : 5 electrons per site , with a polarized net spin 1/2 and antiferro - orbital ( afo ) correlations .",
    "the existence of fm correlations is a direct consequence of the multiorbital nature of the model and the robust value of @xmath8 in the fm regime .",
    "states with the largest weight in the ground state of a 4-site chain solved exactly .",
    "note that each state has 8-fold degeneracy . at @xmath8=0 ,",
    "these three states have the same weight . on the other hand , for nonzero @xmath8 , the state ( a ) ( and its 8-fold degenerate states ) has the largest weight , with a spin ( orbital ) structure factor peaked at @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the states ( b ) and ( c ) ( each one also with degeneracy 8) have the second- and third - largest weights , respectively , for nonzero @xmath8 . ]    on the other hand , a more complex electron configuration emerges in the pm phase .",
    "the meaning of the full circles in the inset of fig .",
    "1 for the pm phase is to denote either a spin up or a spin down .",
    "note , however , that quantum fluctuations are strong and the configuration shown in fig .  1 is just a guidance . to obtain insight into the ground - state wave function ,",
    "it is useful to consider the case of a four - site chain , where results can be obtained exactly by using the lanczos method . in the strong - coupling limit @xmath42 ( or , more precisely , @xmath43 ) , it is found that the most important portion of the ground - state wave function is expressed as @xmath44 where the sum is taken over the permutation of the four spinors and @xmath45 is the number of permutation we have to perform to recover the original configuration .",
    "namely , the electron configuration presented in the pm phase of fig .  1 should be regarded as the equivalent of the 4 spinors contained in @xmath46 .",
    "note that this is not a rigid configuration , but all permutations are equally important at small @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , all the 24 states have the same weight in the ground state at @xmath8=0 , while at finite @xmath8 , the 24 states are split into three classes with 8 states for each , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "note that each of these classes lead to a distinct peak position in the spin and orbital structure factors . when the peak positions in these channels are denoted by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the class ( a ) has @xmath47=@xmath40 and @xmath48=@xmath41 , class ( b ) @xmath47=@xmath40 and @xmath48=@xmath40 , and class ( c ) @xmath47=@xmath41 and @xmath48=@xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath15 orbital is fully occupied due to the one dimensionality of the system that prevents the movement of electrons in this orbital due to a vanishing hopping . for the active @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath16 orbitals , the electrons are not distributed in a rigid charge - ordered pattern , but instead the density is to an excellent approximation equal to 1.5 at every site .",
    "note that a similar representation of the ground - state wave function for four sites has been found for the @xmath49 spin - orbital model.@xcite as discussed in more detail below , these two models are related to each other .      to understand more quantitatively the magnetic order present in the pm phase , it is useful to measure the spin - spin correlation function , defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51=@xmath52 is the @xmath18-projection of the total spin at each site and @xmath53 is the number of site pairs @xmath54 satisfying @xmath55=@xmath56 .",
    "we average over all pairs of sites separated by distance @xmath55 , in order to minimize boundary effects . in fig .",

    "it is found that the numerical data of @xmath57 are well reproduced by the function @xmath58 as shown by the dashed curve .",
    "note that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are appropriate fitting parameters .",
    "the result indicates that the spin - spin correlation function has a four - site periodicity and decays as a power law with critical exponent 3/2 . in the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) , we also present the fourier transform of the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath61 for @xmath10=@xmath62 and @xmath10=@xmath29 .",
    "as observed in this figure , finite - size effects appear to be very small . here",

    "inset shows @xmath63 for @xmath1=@xmath39 and 5 . ]",
    "let us here discuss the physical meaning of the four - site periodicity .",
    "since the @xmath15 orbital is fully occupied in our studies , the @xmath0-orbital hubbard model can be regarded as a two - orbital hubbard model composed only of @xmath14 and @xmath16 orbitals .",
    "note that for this two orbital model , the hopping amplitudes are symmetric and there is no off - diagonal elements .",
    "moreover , when @xmath8=@xmath71 , in the two orbital model , there exists an extra @xmath49 symmetry involving both spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "in such a case , the effective hamiltonian in the strong - coupling limit is given by the @xmath49 spin - orbital model , which has been investigated intensively in recent years.@xcite concerning a less symmetric case than @xmath49 , the effect of @xmath8 has also been discussed,@xcite where anisotropic exchange interactions arise in the orbital part .",
    "note that the spin - spin correlation function , presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) , is found to have a four - site periodicity and decay as a power law with critical exponent 3/2.@xcite these results are consistent with previous analytical work  @xcite and numerical analysis  @xcite for the @xmath49 spin - orbital model .    here",
    "we stress that the spin - spin correlation functions for @xmath1=@xmath66 clearly present distinct behavior from the results already reported at @xmath1=@xmath39,@xcite where an exponential decay has been observed , as depicted as a linear - log plot in fig .",
    "the result indicates a @xmath72 spin - excitation spectrum for @xmath1=@xmath66 , with power - law decaying correlations , in contrast to a gapfull behavior for @xmath1=@xmath39 .",
    "note that , for better comparison , we have normalized @xmath73 in such a way that the correlations are the same at distance one .",
    "we have eliminated the odd sites for @xmath1=@xmath66 , since the results there are close to zero ( see fig .",
    "note also that working with @xmath30=@xmath31 , it is difficult to reach good accuracy for the correlations at large distances , since they are very small .",
    "for this reason , in our results we present only the first 19 sites.@xcite    in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we also show the spin - spin correlation function for @xmath1=3 , reported here for the first time to our knowledge . in the case of @xmath1=3",
    ", it is naively expected that the local spin @xmath74=3/2 is formed at each site . by analogy with the half - odd - integer - spin antiferromagnetic heisenberg chains ,",
    "we expect the power - law decay of the spin - spin correlation function and a gapless spin - excitation spectrum as well.@xcite on the contrary , we can observe in fig .",
    "3(b ) that the spin - spin correlation function shows an exponential decay similar to the case for the integer - spin chains . to understand this peculiar behavior , it is necessary to take into account the effect of @xmath0 orbitals . as mentioned above",
    ", electrons in the @xmath15 orbital can not hop , while electrons in the @xmath14 and @xmath16 orbitals move to adjacent sites with the same amplitude .",
    "then , it is expected that only electrons in the @xmath14 and @xmath16 orbitals contribute to the exchange interaction , and the @xmath1=3 system is regarded as an effective @xmath74=1 chain , leading to the exponential decaying spin - spin correlation function .    in fig .",
    "3(c ) , @xmath63 is shown for several densities .",
    "since the finite - size effects seem to be small , we consider @xmath10=@xmath62 .",
    "as observed in these studies , the results suggest that the peak position changes linearly with the electron density as @xmath64=@xmath75 ( mod @xmath41 ) .",
    "note that this peak is clearly robust for @xmath1=@xmath39 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3(c ) , and substantially decreases its intensity by increasing the density @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to remark that the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) is very similar to the results found by ogata and shiba in their study of the one - dimensional hubbard model at quarter - filling and @xmath25=@xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "9 of ref .  ) . clearly , in the model studied in this paper , the electrons in the two bands with a nonzero hopping behave like one - band models with a strong on - site repulsion , at least from the perspective of the spin correlations .",
    "note , however , that these two one - band models are connected via the coulombic repulsion which , as discussed below , will open a gap in the spectrum of charge excitations .",

    "4(a ) , the charge gap is shown as a function of @xmath78 at densities @xmath1=@xmath39 and @xmath66 , for particular values of @xmath36 and @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , at these densities the charge gap extrapolates to a nonzero value in the thermodynamic limit , indicating that the system is an @xmath84 . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , for non - integer electron densities , the charge gaps seem to extrapolate to zero in the thermodynamic limit , suggesting a metallic behavior .",
    "these results indicate that a transition from an insulating phase to a metallic regime is obtained by changing the density away from @xmath1=5 .    in fig .",
    "4(c ) , the charge gap for the density @xmath1=@xmath66 and @xmath10=@xmath79 is presented .",

    "note that the spin - spin correlation function shows the four - site periodicity and @xmath63 has the peak at @xmath64=@xmath40 for @xmath36=10 and @xmath8=1 , as shown in fig .",
    "to clarify the similarity between the two - orbital model composed of the @xmath14 and @xmath16 orbitals and the @xmath49 spin - orbital model , we investigate @xmath57 and @xmath120 for the present @xmath0 model , at @xmath36=@xmath70 and @xmath8=0 . as shown in figs .",
    "7(e ) and ( f ) , it is clearly observed that @xmath120 and @xmath57 present exactly the same behavior with a four - site periodicity , due to the presence of the @xmath49 symmetry at @xmath8=0 .",
    "when we include the effect of @xmath8 , the spin and orbital degrees of freedom are no longer equivalent , but we can observe the four - site periodicity in both @xmath120 and @xmath57 due to the influence of the @xmath49 symmetry at @xmath8=0 .",
    "thus , the short - range orbital correlation for small @xmath8 originates in the @xmath49 singlet at @xmath8=0 .",
    "it should be mentioned that there is no indication of orbital lro in the pm phase , since @xmath121 converges to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit , as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) . on the other hand",
    ", although we have found no signature of orbital order between the @xmath14 and @xmath16 orbitals through the orbital structure factor @xmath109 for @xmath113=@xmath111=0 , a more complex combination between these orbitals could exist , but we can not observe it directly from @xmath109 with @xmath111=0 . in order to consider other combinations , we set @xmath113=@xmath111 and change the value of @xmath111 .",
    "however , even in this case , we do not observe any changes in @xmath109 , as observed in fig .",
    "namely , the orbital correlation does not change due to the rotation in the orbital space , and we can not determine the optimal orbitals . note that even if we optimize @xmath113 at each site , @xmath121 is always maximum .",
    "thus , we conclude that the states considered in our investigations do not have long - range orbital order in the pm phase .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the properties of the one - dimensional hubbard model with three active orbitals , with emphasis on electron densities of relevance for cobalt oxides .",
    "we envision this work as a first step toward a numerical accurate study of many - body hamiltonians for co - oxides including the coulombic repulsion .",
    "our main result is the identification of two dominant tendencies in the ground state .",
    "for example , at sufficiently large hund s coupling , a tendency toward a fully saturated ferromagnetic state exists .",
    "this state may develop long - range charge order in the case when the interorbital repulsion @xmath26 is large , at density @xmath1=5 , and for nonzero values of the coupling in the direction perpendicular to the chains .    in previous investigations of co - oxides models , tendencies toward fm",
    "were also discussed ( see , for instance , refs .   and and references therein ) .",
    "thus , evidence is accumulating that magnetic states should be of relevance for these materials .",
    "this is clearly compatible with experiments for perovskites cobaltites.@xcite however , thus far only for large na doping , magnetism has been observed experimentally in triangular lattices.@xcite this result may arise from the competition with the higher dimensional version of the pm state discussed in this work .",
    "this state has short - range correlations in all channels , and in some limits it has an extra @xmath49 symmetry as in two orbital models .",
    "while this exact symmetry may appear only in one dimension and for @xmath8=0 , remnants may remain under more realistic conditions .    to the extent that our results can be qualitatively extended to higher dimensions , the main competition in co - oxide models originates from fm and pm states , with long - range and short - range spin and charge order , respectively .",
    "of course , the effect of geometrical frustration could be also an important ingredient to bring about the complex spin - charge - orbital structure in the triangular - lattice systems .",
    "in fact , two of the authors have revealed that the spin frustration is suppressed due to the orbital ordering in the @xmath122-orbital model on a zigzag chain.@xcite in addition , in the present work we have identified metal - insulator transitions with doping away from @xmath1=5 , while the main properties in the spin and charge sectors remain similar as for the integer density @xmath1=5 .",
    "the next challenge is to increase the dimensionality of the @xmath0 system toward two dimensions by studying ladders and/or zigzag chains .",
