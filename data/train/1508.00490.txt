    "the huge increase recently seen in the construction of quantitative models in the biological sciences , especially ecology , has prompted a renewed interest in stochastic effects in these systems  @xcite . in computer simulations",
    "processes such as birth , death , predation , and many others , are quite naturally treated as random . in the mathematical versions of these individual - based models ,",
    "the stochastic effects are present ; they only vanish in the limit of infinitely many individuals , when deterministic equations are obtained",
    ". however , in some important situations , the stochastic effects can be so large as to invalidate the conclusions based on a purely deterministic analysis  @xcite .",
    "hence the interest in stochastic dynamics , and the mathematical techniques which can be used to elucidate them .",
    "the deterministic limit usually yields a set of coupled ordinary differential equations in time .",
    "these can be analysed using the well - developed ideas from the theory of dynamical systems involving concepts such as trajectories in phase space and attractors of various kinds .",
    "stochastic systems have their own , different , set of concepts such as stochastic fluctuations about the deterministic trajectories , rare events which lead to transitions from one attractor of the deterministic dynamics to another , stationary probability distributions , and so on .",
    "it is the tools that can be used to calculate some of these quantities for a wide class of models that will of interest to us in this paper .",
    "we will focus on extinction dynamics , that is , transitions from the vicinity of a non - trivial fixed point of the deterministic dynamics , to a trivial fixed point where all the individuals have become extinct . if the parameters of the models are chosen so that the two fixed points are not too close , then extinctions will be rare and the state of the system will continue to fluctuate about the non - trivial fixed point for a long period of time .",
    "in this situation the van kampen system - size expansion  @xcite has proved to be a powerful tool .",
    "essentially the method gives the deterministic equations to leading order in a expansion in ( inverse ) system - size , and linear stochastic corrections to this result at next - to - leading order .",
    "this linear approximation , sometimes called the linear - noise approximation , corresponds to gaussian fluctuations , and is an excellent approximation if extinctions are so rare as to be negligible .    in principle",
    ", extinction events can be incorporated into the system - size expansion by going beyond the gaussian approximation , and including non - linear terms in the stochastic differential equation giving the approximate stochastic dynamics .",
    "this should give rise to a tail on one side of the probability distribution function which will characterise the extinction process .",
    "these higher - order calculations have only been carried out recently , and then only by a few authors  @xcite .",
    "in addition if there are only a few individuals in the system , extinction effects will be very important , and one may have to go to quite high - order in the expansion to get an accurate form for what will be a very non - gaussian distribution .",
    "by contrast , the standard technique to look at rare events , found going from one metastable state to another , is to use a wkb - like approximation .",
    "this goes under many names : large deviation theory  @xcite , the instanton method  @xcite , freidlin - wentzell theory @xcite , amongst others .",
    "it consists of postulating that the dominant contribution to the probability distribution is exponentially small in @xmath0 , the system - size , that is , is of the order of @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is a function of variables describing the system in the deterministic limit which turns out to satisfy a hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian , known as the freidlin ",
    "wentzell hamiltonian , can be used to describe the extinction trajectories , even though they are stochastic in nature .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the connection between the van kampen system - size expansion at higher - order and the wkb method .",
    "they have a very different basis , and to the best of our knowledge , their predictive power in regimes where extinctions are important have not been compared",
    ". we will carry out the explicit assessment of their range of validity and comparison with numerical simulations on a specific stochastic system with one degree of freedom to minimise numerical errors . in the case of the wkb method ,",
    "most of the steps can be performed analytically , which also makes the interpretation of the results more straightforward .",
    "a simple dynamical system with a stable non - trivial fixed point and an unstable trivial fixed point is the logistic equation @xmath3 $ ] , and the stochastic model we will choose to study will have this equation as its deterministic limit .",
    "in this section we will introduce the individual based model we will analyse and write down the master equation , which governs its stochastic dynamics .",
    "the two techniques we are comparing can be viewed as different approximations to these dynamics .",
    "we will describe them in turn and then compare them to numerical simulations of the original individual based model in section  [ simulations ] .",
    "following the discussion in the introduction , probably the simplest model which contains the features which we wish to explore is a system containing identical individuals , which we will denote by @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that there are @xmath5 such individuals , and since the size of the system is taken to be characterised by an integer @xmath0 , we suppose that there are @xmath6 nulls denoted by @xmath7",
    ". these are vacancies , which in a spatial version of the model would denote spaces which could potentially be colonised by a individual .",
    "if the only processes are ( asexual ) birth , competition and death , then we may define the well - mixed model through the reactions @xmath8 the last equation , for instance , indicates that an individual of type @xmath4 dies at a rate @xmath9 to give a vacancy , @xmath7 .",
    "simple combinatorics then gives the rate at which the number of individuals increases from @xmath5 to @xmath10 to be given by @xmath11 .",
    "a more accurate statement of these rates would replace one of the @xmath0 factors in the denominator by @xmath12 , but since we wish to keep the analysis as simple as possible we will not do this .",
    "if we scale the time by a factor of @xmath0 , then the transition rate from state @xmath5 to state @xmath10 may be written as : @xmath13 similarly , the transition rate from state @xmath5 to state @xmath14 is @xmath15 where once again factors of @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been replaced by @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . since the transition rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 define the model , this choice simply corresponds to a slight variant of the standard model , which can be justified on grounds of simplicity .",
    "the master equation is an equation for the rate of change with time of the probability of finding @xmath5 individuals in the system at time @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "since this is simply the rate of transitions into the state @xmath5 minus the rate of transitions out of state @xmath5 , it reads  @xcite @xmath24 this equation can not be solved exactly , so we need to resort to either numerical methods or approximation techniques .",
    "it is frequently simpler to simulate  @xcite the processes given in eq .",
    "( [ reactions ] ) , rather than numerically solve the master equation , and the results we give in section  [ simulations ] to assess the accuracy of the approximation techniques are found in this way .",
    "we now briefly outline the two approximation methods that we use in this paper .",
    "the first , the van kampen system - size expansion , has as the leading - order approximation the deterministic differential equation found by taking the limit @xmath25 . in the case of",
    "the model just described , this is the logistic equation given in the introduction .",
    "however this equation emerges as the leading order approximation to the model defined by eqs .",
    "( [ n_to_n+1 ] ) and ( [ n_to_n-1 ] ) , and does not have to be postulated independently . the next - to - leading order gives a linear stochastic differential equation , which describes gaussian fluctuations about the deterministic result .",
    "if the intention is to simply study the stochastic dynamics of the model well away from the boundaries , it is usually sufficient to work to this order .",
    "however it is possible to go higher orders to obtain non - gaussian corrections to the probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper is to argue that these higher - order corrections enable reliable estimates for the pdf to be obtained very close to the boundaries .    to apply the van kampen expansion",
    "we first write down the master equation ( [ master ] ) in terms of step - operators @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an arbitrary function  @xcite , @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left ( { \\cal e}^{- } - 1 \\right )   \\left[t(n+1|n)p(n , t ) \\right ] . \\label{var_master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ansatz which forms the basis of the method is to write  @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the solution of the deterministic equation valid in the limit @xmath25 and @xmath32 is the ( continuous ) stochastic variable which gives the deviation of the stochastic trajectory from this deterministic value .",
    "the pdf when written in terms of @xmath32 is denoted as @xmath33 , thus @xmath34 .",
    "after the change of variables ( [ ansatz ] ) , the left - hand side of the master equation ( [ master ] ) becomes : @xmath35 the right - hand side of the master equation in the form ( [ var_master ] ) can also be written in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath32 by ( i ) eliminating @xmath5 in the transition rates ( [ n_to_n+1 ] ) and ( [ n_to_n-1 ] ) using eq .",

    "the general way to proceed in such cases is to impose some form of truncation which will eventually lead to a closed , self - consistent set of equations . for the case of the model we are investigating here , the fact that eq .",

    "the second method is to use a wkb approximation .",

    "<S> stochastic fluctuations are central to the understanding of extinction dynamics . in the context of population models they allow for the description of the transition from the vicinity of a non - trivial fixed point of the deterministic dynamics to a trivial fixed point , where the population has become extinct . to characterize analytically the fluctuations of a given stochastic population model </S>",
    "<S> , one can operate within the so - called linear - noise approximation . here </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are taken to be gaussian , and the phenomenon of extinction is so rare as to be negligible , for all practical purposes . when the size of the population becomes small , non - gaussian fluctuations are instead found . </S>",
    "<S> two analytical schemes are in principle available to determine the nature of the distribution of associated fluctuations : the generalized van kampen system - size expansion beyond the conventional order of approximation and a wkb - like method . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the accuracy of these two different approximation schemes , with reference to a simple stochastic process that converges to the logistic equation in the deterministic limit . </S>"
