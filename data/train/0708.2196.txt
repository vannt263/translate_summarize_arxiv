    "cold atoms in optical lattices exhibit phenomena typical of solid state physics like the formation of energy bands , josephson effects and bloch oscillations .",
    "many of these phenomena have been already the object of experimental investigations . for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "as the light fields that are used to create the optical lattices are intense and strongly detuned from any atomic transition , their properties can be safely approximated by classical fields . however ,",
    "if the system is confined in a high - q cavity , the quantum properties of the field becomes important , and the atoms move in quantized potentials .    experimental implementation of a combination of cold atoms and cavity qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) has made significant progress @xcite . theoretically there have been some interesting work on the correlated atom - field dynamics in a cavity .",
    "it has been shown that the strong coupling of the condensed atoms to the cavity mode changes the resonance frequency of the cavity @xcite .",
    "finite cavity response times lead to damping of the coupled atom - field excitations @xcite . the driving field in the cavity can significantly enhance the localization and the cooling properties of the system@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in a cavity the atomic back action on the field introduces atom - field entanglement which modifies the associated quantum phase transition @xcite . the light field and the atoms become strongly entangled if the latter are in a superfluid state , in which case the photon statistics typically exhibits complicated multimodal structures @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate some structural properties of the coupled condensate ( these are large atom samples)-light field system in the optical lattice potential of the cavity .",
    "in contrast to ref.@xcite , we treat the atoms within the mean - field framework .",
    "this is a valid approximation , if the number of atoms is large .",
    "the mean - field approach allows one to determine the bloch dynamics and the bogoliubov excitations in a straight forward manner .",
    "the long range atom - atom interactions are known to persist even in the bad cavity limit ( which we assume here)and in the semiclassical limit @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "treating the atoms quantum mechanically , the correlation between the photon - number fluctuations and the atom - number fluctuations becomes important and will be reflected in measurable frequency dependent observables such as cavity transmission spectra @xcite .",
    "as we are interested in the limit where the condensate is not destroyed by the light field , we will assume a large detuning of the pump field from the atomic resonance .",
    "morever as mentioned earlier , we will be in the bad cavity limit where the cavity decay dominate over the spontaneous decay of all atoms thus allowing us to omit the effect of atomic decay .",
    "we also assume that the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity is much smaller than the longitudinal mode spacing , so that we restrict the model to a single longitudinal mode .",
    "an important feature produced by the periodic potential is the occurrence of a typical band structure of the condensate in the energy spectra . because of the strong coupling of the condensate wave function to the cavity modes , a band structure of the condensate also leads to a band structure of the intracavity light fields .",
    "this in turn influences the bloch energies , effective mass , bogoliubov excitations and the superfluid fraction of the bec .",
    "we will explicitly discuss the change in the behavior of the system as a function of the quantum optical lattice depth , the pump - cavity detuning and the pump amplitude .",
    "this study reveals that the pump and the cavity now emerges as a new handle to control the coherence properties of the bec , which offer the potential for improved interferometric technique , quantum information processing and efficient control of nonlinear excitations such as solitons .",
    "a wealth of new phenomena can be expected in the many - body physics of quantum gases with pump - cavity mediated interaction .",
    "expressions for the tunneling parameter , the bloch energy , the bogoliubov spectrum and the effective mass in a quantum optical lattice are new results , derived here for the first time .",
    "in this section , we introduce our model and calculate the effective optical lattice for which we follow earlier works@xcite .",
    "we consider an elongated cigar shaped bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0 two - level atoms with mass @xmath1 and transition frequency @xmath2 strongly interacting with a single one - dimensional standing wave quantized single cavity mode of frequency @xmath3 . in order to create an elongated bec",
    ", the frequency of the harmonic trap along the transverse direction should be much larger than one in the axial ( along the direction of the optical lattice ) direction .",
    "the system is also coherently driven by a laser field with frequency @xmath4 through the cavity mirror with amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "both the standing wave and the pump laser are weak(small photon number ) so that we treat them quantum - mechanically .",
    "the quantum nature of the light is not an essential requirement for the results that follow but is essential for measurement of the transmission spectra which depends on the photon number @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that high - q optical cavities can significantly isolate the system from its environment , thus strongly reducing decoherence and ensuring that the light field remains quantum - mechanical for the duration of the experiment .",
    "the quantum nature of the light field can be used to probe the number - statistics of the matter - wave field due to atom - photon entanglement .",
    "classical radiation only provides information on some average of the atomic occupation numbers . the harmonic confinement along the directions perpendicular to the optical lattice is taken to be large so that the system effectively reduces to one - dimension .",
    "this system is modeled by a jaynes - cummings type of hamiltonian @xmath7 in a rotating wave and dipole approximation @xcite        .

    "we will always take @xmath20 . in this case the condensate is attracted to the nodes of the light field and hence the lowest bound state is localized at these positions which leads to a reduced coupling of the condensate to the cavity compared to that for @xmath21 .",
    "along @xmath22 , the cavity field forms an optical lattice potential of period @xmath23 and depth @xmath24 .",
    "we now write the hamiltonian in a second quantized form including the two body interaction term .    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the field operator for the atoms .",
    "here @xmath27 is the two body @xmath28-wave scattering length .",

    "the nearest neighbor nonlinear interaction terms are usually very small compared to the onsite interaction and are neglected as usual .",
    "the onsite energies @xmath34 and @xmath35 are set to zero .",
    "we now write down the heisenberg equation of motion for the cavity photons @xmath15 and the bosonic field operator @xmath36 as    @xmath37    @xmath38    here we have introduced @xmath39 as the field damping rate . equation ( 6 ) for the cavity field and equation ( 7 ) for the atomic field represents a set of coupled equations describing the dynamics of the compound system formed by the condensate and the optical cavity .",
    "we will work in the bad cavity limit , where typically , @xmath39 is the fastest time scale ( this means that the cavity decay rate is much larger than the oscillation frequency of bound atoms in the optical lattice of the cavity ) . in this limit",
    "the intracavity field adiabatically follows the condensate wavefunction , and hence we can put @xmath40 . we treat the bec within the mean field framework and assume the tight binding approximation where we replace @xmath41 by @xmath42 and look for solutions in the form of bloch waves    @xmath43    here @xmath44 is the chemical potential",

    "the tight binding approximation becomes more and more accurate as the depth of the optical lattice increases and this can be achieved by a strong laser which makes up the optical lattice or a strong external pump .",
    "alternatively , we can also achieve the tight binding regime by keeping the pump - cavity detuning @xmath47 .",
    "this yields from equation ( 6 )    @xmath48    interestingly we find that due to the atomic backaction , the quantum state of the cavity field varies along the brillioun zone .",

    "a decrease in the pump - cavity detuning @xmath55 increases this atomic backaction and the potential increases .",

    "the influence of the pump on the superfluid fraction is also shown in the same figure . for a pump amplitude of @xmath150 ( thick line ) the decrease of the superfluid fraction",
    "is slow as the height of the lattice increases . on the other hand",
    "when we increase the pump amplitude to @xmath110 ( thin line ) , the superfluid fraction depletes much faster for larger lattice heights .",

    "these results are consistent with earlier work @xcite , where it was found that the fluctuations in the atom number is enhanced ( increase in the superfluid fraction ) as @xmath55 increases ( decrease in lattice depth ) .",
    "a direct consequence of the decrease in the superfluid fraction is a decrease in the number fluctuation .",
    "this effect can be seen directly by looking at the interference pattern of a bec released from an optical trap .",
    "in contrast to this destructive measurement , one also measure the transmission spectra since various phases of the bec show qualitatively distinct light scattering @xcite .",
    "the common coupling of all atoms to the same mode introduces cavity - mediated long - range interactions and also the atomic backaction on the field introduces atom - field entanglement @xcite .",
    "consequently , when the atom - number fluctuation changes ( which is a direct consequence of a change in the superfluid fraction ) , the photon - number fluctuations will also change , which will be reflected in the transmission spectra .    finally , we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed experiment .",
    "the setup shown in , could be part of a ring resonator as described in ref .",
    "the ultra - cold atoms are trapped inside an optical standing wave formed by two mutually counter - propagating light waves in a high - q ring resonator .",
    "an external pump can drive the system through one of the side mirrors .",
    "a typical problem one encounters experimentally is that the cavity field may not be far detuned from the atomic transition and hence induce spontaneous emission .",
    "this will reduce the lifetime of the bec in the cavity . yet",
    "another experimental fact , that the atoms are coupled to more than one cavity mode may complicate the atom - field dynamics .",
    "the energy of the cavity mode decreases due to the photon loss through the cavity mirrors , which leads to a reduced atom - field coupling .",
    "photon loss can be minimized by using high - q cavities .",
    "our proposed detection scheme relies crucially on the fact that coherent dynamics dominate over the losses .",
    "it is important that the characteristic time - scales of coherent dynamics are significantly faster than those associated with losses ( the decay rate ( @xmath39 ) of state - of - art optical cavities is typically 17 khz @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this fact has become experimentally feasible recently @xcite . experiments with high - q cavities , which employ standing wave modes tuned close to an atomic transition ,",
    "rapidly destroy the bec due to spontaneous emission .",
    "moreover accessing strong atom - field coupling under these circumstances puts severe restriction on the size of the cavities that can be employed .",
    "these conditions imply the need for short cavities , which can hold small atomic samples .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have explored a new regime of the interaction between atoms and high - q cavities : bound atom - cavity systems involving several millions atoms , which operate far from atomic resonances . they showed that in a ring cavity , even at large detunings from the atomic resonance a strong coupling between the atoms and the cavity field can be achieved .",
    "we have studied the effect of a one dimensional optical lattice in a cavity on the bloch energy , the effective mass , the bogoliubov excitation and the superfluid fraction of a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the cavity light field develops a photonic band structure due to the strong coupling with the condensate . in the presence of the external pump , the effective mass increases and the bloch and",
    "the bogoliubov energies are reduced .",
    "we have shown that in the cavity , the strong coupling between the atoms and the quantized fields suppresses the superfluidity and hence generates atom - number squeezed state for improved atom - interferometry @xcite .",
    "an additional control over the phase coherence in the superfluid can be achieved by the external pump and the pump - cavity detuning.the effective mass in an optical lattice determines the properties of localized nonlinear excitations such as solitons . manipulating the amplitude of the external pump and the pump - cavity detuning",
    ", we now have a possibility to efficiently control such nonlinear excitations in an optical cavity .",
