    "the formation process of high - mass stars ( @xmath11 ) is poorly understood @xcite .",
    "one key question in the field is whether high - mass stars form as a scaled - up version of low - mass star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a standard paradigm of low - mass star formation , a protostar accretes from a circumstellar disk embedded within an infalling envelope @xcite .",
    "since accretion disks and collimated outflows are physically connected , the detection of well collimated outflows in an increasing number of high - mass star - forming regions supports an accretion - based scenario for massive star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in the meantime , great efforts have been made in searching for direct evidence for an infalling envelope and a rotating disk in association with massive star formation .",
    "nevertheless , only a very few massive star - forming cores have been found to show clear signatures of both infall and rotation .",
    "beltrn ( 2011 ) enlists a sample of six such sources from the literature , g10.62 - 0.38 , g19.61 - 0.23 , g24.78 + 0.08 a1 , g31.41 + 0.31 , w51 e2 , and w51 north .",
    "but some more cases exist ( e.g. , ngc 7538 irs 1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these studies ,",
    "a rotation is inferred from a velocity gradient seen in high - density tracing molecular lines and an infall is probed by molecular lines with redshifted absorption against a bright continuum source .",
    "even this small sample should be taken with caution .",
    "for example , the orientations of the velocity gradients may change by tens of degrees , depending on the lines being analyzed ( e.g. , w51 e2 : * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . meanwhile ,",
    "if a velocity gradient is arising from a rotating disk , it is expected to be perpendicular to a bipolar outflow , but for most sources in the sample , such an association between a putative disk and an outflow is yet to be confirmed ( e.g. , g31.41 + 0.31 , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , identifying and characterizing clear - cut examples showing self - consistent outflow , infall , and rotation motions remains of great interest to our understanding of massive star formation .",

    "mm1 shows rich emission lines in complex organic molecules , e.g. , ch@xmath6oh , ch@xmath6cn , c@xmath40h@xmath6cn , and c@xmath40h@xmath41cn .",
    "the ch@xmath6cn ( 1211 ) @xmath42-ladder is a good thermometer of dense gas in high - mass star - forming regions .",

    "the gas mass of mm1 is then estimated from its 1.3 mm dust continuum flux , 0.76 jy , to be 13 @xmath2 , by adopting a canonical gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the mass of mm2 is less clear given its unknown gas or dust temperature .",
    "adopting a temperature of 30 k deduced from prior nh@xmath6 observations @xcite , one obtains a mass of 25 @xmath2 from the continuum flux of 0.2 jy .",
    "figure [ outflow ] shows the velocity integrated co ( 21 ) and sio ( 54 ) emission observed with the sma .",
    "both co and sio emission seems to be dominated by a northeast - southwest ( ne - sw ) bipolar outflow centered at mm1 .",
    "the outflow has a biconical shape with an opening angle of @xmath065@xmath54 .",
    "such an outflow is often thought to form from ambient gas being swept up or entrained by a wide - angle wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a blueshifted clump to the south of mm1 and a redshifted clump to the north , which are more prominent in the co map , could be part of the biconical outflow , if the wide - angle wind is slightly inclined to the plane of sky and impinges into an environment with an inhomogeneous density structure .",
    "however , the possibility that the two clumps form another outflow can not be ruled out .",
    "figure [ co_ch ] shows the velocity channel maps of the co emission observed with the sma ; at low velocities ( 96112.5 kms@xmath8 ) , the maps made with the combined sma and iram 30 m ( sma+30 m ) data are also presented .",
    "it is clear that the combined data effectively recover extended emission around the cloud velocity .",
    "emission arising from outflow structures appears predominant in channels of @xmath55100.5 kms@xmath8 and @xmath56106.5 kms@xmath8 . in particular , the cone - shaped structure of the sw lobe is most noticeable in the 106.5 kms@xmath8 channel map .",
    "the emission at 111.0 and 112.5 kms@xmath8 is mostly filtered out in the sma maps and appears to be dominated by diffuse gas in the combined maps .",
    "this is most likely due to the self - absorption effect caused by a foreground cloud .",
    "figure [ sio_ch ] shows the sio ( 54 ) channel maps .",
    "sio is believed to be produced in the gas phase through shock - driven sputtering of si - bearing species on dust grains @xcite . therefore the sio emission is not contaminated by emission from quiescent ambient gas . as seen in the integrated map ,",
    "the sio outflow is in general consistent with the outflow seen in the co emission .",
    "figure [ 13co_ch ] shows the sma @xmath9co ( 21 ) channel maps as well as the sma+30 m maps at low velocities .",
    "the @xmath9co emission arising from the ne - sw outflow is less extended than that in co ( 21 ) , but is still appreciable in the channels of 94.5108.0 kms@xmath8 ( except the 103.5  kms@xmath8 channel ) . in the close vicinity of mm1 , the @xmath9co emission peaks to the nw of mm1 at blueshifted velocities and to the se at redshifted velocities ; the offset between the @xmath9co peak and dust continuum peak decreases with the velocity so that the @xmath9co emission approximately coincides with mm1 at the highest velocities . on the other hand ,",
    "the co ( 21 ) emission peak is clearly offset from mm1 even at the highest velocities , and shifts from the ne to sw .",
    "such a difference is highlighted in figure [ co_13co ] .",
    "while the relatively extended emission in @xmath9co traces the outflow , the compact and bright emission closely around mm1 is predominantly arising from a dense envelope .",
    "the @xmath9co ( 21 ) observations provide hints for the rotation of dense gas around mm1 ( figure [ co_13co ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath9co ( 21 ) line is affected by the outflow and , with a critical density , @xmath57 , of order @xmath58 @xmath59 and an upper level energy , @xmath60 , around 16 k above the ground , can not effectively probe the hot and dense gas within mm1 . to search for a potential disk - like structure , which is supposed to lie in the innermost part of a molecular core , we inspected high - excitation lines from less abundant molecular species .",
    "a nw - se velocity gradient across mm1 is consistently seen .",
    "figure [ rotation ] shows the zeroth moment ( velocity integrated emission ) and first moment ( intensity weighted velocity ) maps , and position - velocity ( @xmath61-@xmath62 ) diagrams of the ch@xmath6oh ( 15@xmath6316@xmath64)@xmath65 , ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath66@xmath67 ) , and vibrational ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath68@xmath69 ) lines .",
    "these lines are chosen for the following reasons .",
    "first , they are highly excited ( @xmath70 k ) and , as evidenced by the zeroth moment maps , probe the innermost dense gas in mm1 .",
    "second , they are not significantly blended with other lines ; ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath66@xmath67 ) is slightly blended with ch@xmath47cn ( @xmath71@xmath72 ) , but the two lines are @xmath09.5 kms@xmath8 apart and the former is three times brighter than the latter , so it is feasible to ignore the contribution from ch@xmath47cn ( @xmath71@xmath72 ) in interpreting ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath66@xmath67 ) .",
    "finally , these lines are detected with sufficient signal - to - noise ratios in the vex observations so that the velocity gradient is discernable at a @xmath73 resolution ; some other lines with a higher @xmath60 , e.g. , ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath74@xmath75 ) , or with a lower optical depth , e.g. , ch@xmath47cn ( @xmath76@xmath77 ) , are subject to limited signal - to - noise ratios and barely show the nw - se velocity gradient . from the first moment maps of ch@xmath6oh ( 15@xmath6316@xmath64)@xmath65 and ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath66@xmath67 ) ,",
    "the velocity gradient is approximately along a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath78 , which is adopted for the cut of the @xmath61-@xmath62 diagrams .",
    "the vibrational ch@xmath6cn ( @xmath68@xmath69 ) line has the highest excitation and lowest signal - to - noise ratio among the three lines shown here .",
    "the direction of the velocity gradient in its first - moment map is less clear , but an overall nw - se gradient is still discernable and the @xmath61-@xmath62 pattern is consistent with those of the other two lines . compared to the orientation of the biconical ne - sw outflow , the ch@xmath6oh and ch@xmath6cn velocity gradient is approximately perpendicular to the outflow axis , and is apparently arising from a disk - like rotation .",
    "however , neither the dust continuum nor the molecular line maps of the mm1 condensation shows a flattened morphology .",
    "this is very likely due to insufficient angular resolutions ( @xmath79 ) of the observations .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , the cn lines probe an infalling envelope around mm1 . in figure",
    "[ absorp ] , the peaking velocities of the emission and absorption are slightly asymmetric with respective to the systemic velocity",
    ". it could be in part due to the uncertainty in determining the systemic velocity , which is estimated to be 103.5 kms@xmath8 in our data but was suggested to be 102.3 kms@xmath8 based on single - dish nh@xmath6 observations @xcite .",
    "mm1 has a gas temperature of 320 k and molecular chemistry characteristic of a hot molecular core ( hmc ) .",
    "at least one high - mass protostar has formed in mm1 . on the other hand ,",

    "the majority of the observed luminosity presumably comes from accretion shocks .",
    "the accretion luminosity can be estimated from @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the mass flux of the accretion onto the star and @xmath99 the radius of the star . again , under the assumption of momentum conservation between the molecular outflow and the underlying wind , @xmath98 can be inferred from the mass outflow rate . without correcting for an unknown inclination angle ,",
    "the dynamical timescale of the outflow , i.e. , a half of the outflow extension ( @xmath00.3 pc ) divided by the terminal velocity , is about @xmath5 yr .",
    "the mass outflow rate is then @xmath100yr@xmath8 , leading to a mass infall rate of @xmath7yr@xmath8 and @xmath101yr@xmath8 .",

    "the large radius of the protostar also reduces the effective temperature and the uv luminosity , thus the faint radio continuum emission is expected to be arising from an ionized jet or wind .",
    "nevertheless , the protostar embedded in mm1 appears to have a current mass of @xmath010 @xmath2 and is in an active accretion phase .",
    "is the accretion onto the central high - mass protostar mediated by a rotating disk ?",
    "the observed co and sio outflow supports a positive answer since a biconical outflow is expected to originate from an accretion disk in low - mass star formation ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed comparison between wide - angle outflows in low - mass and high - mass star formation ) .",

    "for example , in the upper right quadrant of figure [ rotation](e ) , the maximum velocity increases with the decreasing offset ; in the lower left quadrant of figure [ rotation](d ) , a secondary peak around 98.5 kms@xmath8 could be attributed to a keplerian - like motion as well .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the rotation curve of the hmc awaits future observations with greatly improved resolution and sensitivity .",
    "here we look into the lines from more abundant molecular species , i.e. , c@xmath10o and @xmath9co , which may help to deliver a more complete view of the velocity field for the dense gas on a larger scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath9co ( 21 ) can be contaminated by the outflow , but from figure [ co_13co ] , the emission in the close vicinity of mm1 is dominated by the dense envelope . in figure [ rotcur](a )",
    "we plot the @xmath9co and c@xmath10o @xmath61-@xmath62 diagrams , cut along the pa of @xmath78 .",
    "we note that the @xmath9co and c@xmath10o emission arises from a region encompassing both mm1 and mm2 .",
    "however , from the @xmath61-@xmath62 diagrams the velocity field can not be ascribed to an orbiting motion of a binary . in particular ,",
    "the high - excitation lines shown in figure [ rotation ] are not detected toward mm2 ; these lines show a clear velocity gradient across mm1 . in figure",
    "[ rotcur ] , the ch@xmath6cn , c@xmath10o , and @xmath9co emission seems to be arising from different layers of a coherent structure centered at mm1 , whereas mm2 is likely a fragment of this structure .",
    "despite the missing flux closely around the cloud velocity , the @xmath9co @xmath61-@xmath62 diagram shows a concave outer edge and is slightly skewed in a sense consistent with the velocity gradient seen in ch@xmath6oh and ch@xmath6cn .",
    "a similar pattern is discernible in the c@xmath10o @xmath61-@xmath62 diagram , though the emission has a lower velocity dispersion and a smaller spatial extent compared to the @xmath9co emission .",
    "such a @xmath61-@xmath62 pattern may characterize a combination of infall and rotation @xcite . to corroborate this interpretation , we overlay in figure [ rotcur ] a free - fall and keplerian - like rotation model which is described by cesaroni et al .",
    "since the c@xmath10o and @xmath9co emission mostly traces outer layers around the hmc , we set a central dynamical mass of 25 @xmath2 , which is approximately the combined mass of the hmc and the embedded high - mass protostar , and an inner truncation radius of @xmath109 ( 0.008 pc ) , which is approximately the deconvolved radius of the ch@xmath6oh and ch@xmath6cn emission ; the outer radius is set to be @xmath110 ( 0.1 pc ) , roughly the radius of the c@xmath10o and @xmath9co emission .",
    "the constructed model ( solid curve ) reasonably fits the c@xmath10o and @xmath9co @xmath61-@xmath62 diagrams except the high velocity tail close to the zero offset seen in @xmath9co .",
    "that high velocity tail can be partly ascribed to the inner rotating and infalling gas , as illustrated by a scaled - down model ( dashed curve in figure [ rotcur ] ) with a central mass of 10 @xmath2 and outer and inner radii of @xmath109 and @xmath111 ( 200 au ) , respectively , but it can also be arising from the outflowing gas .",
    "overall the bulk @xmath9co and c@xmath10o emission delineates an infalling and rotating envelope around the hmc .    to assess the envelope mass",
    ", we performed a two - component gaussian fitting to the central compact part of the dust ridge with the miriad task imfit , and derived a flux 0.96 jy for the component encompassing mm1 . subtracting the hmc contribution ( 0.76 jy ,",
    "see section [ res_cont ] ) , the dust continuum flux from the cool envelope amounts to 0.2 jy , resulting in a gas mass of @xmath112 for @xmath51 and an adopted temperature of 30 k @xcite . from the fitting ,",
    "the mm2 component has a flux of 0.2 jy , consistent with the measurement based on figure [ cont](b ) ( section [ res_cont ] ) .",
    "hence , the total mass of the central compact part of the dust ridge reaches @xmath113 , whereas the mass of the envelope traced by the @xmath9co and c@xmath10o emission amounts to @xmath114 .",
    "such a massive envelope is presumably gravitationally unstable .",
    "indeed , mm2 is likely the consequence of the fragmentation of the envelope .",
    "however , the hmc itself has a gas mass ( @xmath115 ) comparable to the mass of the accreting protostar ( @xmath116 ) , thus the latter can have an appreciable stabilizing effect on the former .",
    "cesaroni et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggest that a rotational structure of a mass comparable to that of the central protostar , which is in turn less than @xmath117 , resembles an accretion disk rather than a transient toroid . in this sense",
    ", we may expect that as the central protostar continues to accrete and increase its mass , the rotating hmc serves as an accretion disk , and finally dissipates by enhanced uv radiation ( e.g. , by photoevaporation , * ? ? ? * ) rather than by gravitational fragmentation .",
    "the infall motion of the envelope around the hmc is not only appreciable in the c@xmath10o and @xmath9co @xmath61-@xmath62 diagrams , but also more unambiguously evidenced by the cn hyperfine lines with a profound inverse p - cygni profile .",
    "the mass infall rate can be estimated from @xmath118 , where the infall velocity @xmath119 is about 1.5 kms@xmath8 according to the cn ( @xmath15=21 ) profiles ( e.g. , figure [ absorp ] ) , @xmath120 the radius of the envelope , and @xmath121 the mass density .",
    "considering that the cn lines were imaged with a synthesized beam ( @xmath122 ) similar to that of the dust continuum map in figure [ cont](a ) ( @xmath123 ) , we estimate the radius and density based on the above two - component gaussian fitting . for the component encompassing mm1 , @xmath124 ( 5700 au ) from the fitting , and the averaged number density is @xmath125  @xmath59 for a gas mass of @xmath112 .",
    "the mass infall rate is then found to be about @xmath7yr@xmath8 . from the model shown in figure [ rotcur ] ,",
    "the free - fall velocity reaches 3 kms@xmath8 at @xmath126 , a factor of two higher that inferred from the cn profiles .",
    "such a discrepancy can be ascribed to the deviation of the infall motion from the modeled free - fall , the uncertainty of the systemic velocity ( see section [ res_cn ] ) , or an underestimate of the radius from the two - component fitting .",
    "nevertheless , since the ( free - fall plus keplerian - like rotation ) model parameters are not stringently constrained and the cn profiles provide an averaged estimate , the discrepancy is not significant . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed above , the mass outflow rate implies a mass infall rate of @xmath7yr@xmath8 .",
    "though both are subject to large uncertainties , the two independent estimates of the mass infall rate appear to agree with each other , suggesting that the envelope infall is feeding the accretion onto one protostar , i.e. , the @xmath010 @xmath2 star embedded in mm1 .",
    "provided its high accretion rate and the massive gas reservoir available from the envelope , it is reasonable to expect that the star would significantly increase its mass and develop into an o star .",
    "we have presented high - angular - resolution dust continuum and molecular line observations toward iras 18360 - 0537 , a @xmath010@xmath1 star - forming region .",
    "the region shows a 0.5  pc dust ridge , harboring two massive condensations , mm1 and mm2 , in the central part .",
    "mm1 , a hmc with a gas temperature of 320 k and a mass of @xmath115 , is embedded within an infalling envelope , and appears to be rotating about the axis of a bipolar outflow .    the outflow is seen in co ( 21 ) and sio ( 54 ) and shows a biconical shape centered at mm1 .",
    "the gas mass of the outflow is estimated to be @xmath4 , and the dynamical timescale is @xmath5 yr . the rotation of the hmc is inferred from sub - arcsecond observations of high - excitation ch@xmath6oh and ch@xmath6cn lines , which show a velocity gradient approximately perpendicular to the outflow axis . on the other hand , the infall motion of the envelope around the hmc is probed by cn ( @xmath15=21 ) hyperfine lines , which exhibit a profound inverse p - cygni profile .",
    "the estimated mass infall rate is @xmath7yr@xmath8 , comparable to that inferred from the mass outflow rate .",
    "further information on the kinematics of the gas around the hmc is obtained from the c@xmath10o and @xmath9co ( 21 ) lines , whose @xmath61-@xmath62 diagrams can be described with a model of a free - falling and keplerian - like rotating envelope . with these observations , we speculate that a protostar in mm1 , which we suggest to have a current mass of @xmath010 @xmath2 , will grow into an o star via disk accretion and envelope infall , i.e. , through a process similar to the standard paradigm for low - mass star formation .",
