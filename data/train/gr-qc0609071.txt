    "recently , lots of observations have payed attention to the nature of primordial perturbations that gave rise to the inhomogeneities observed in the universe .",
    "the results of these measurements are consistent with an adiabatic and nearly scale invariant spectrum of primordial perturbations , as predicted by the simplest models of inflation @xcite . however , due to the central role of primordial perturbations on the formation of cosmological structure , it is still very interesting and might also be desirable to explore various and possible origins of primordial perturbations .",
    "the inflation stage is supposed to have taken place at the earlier moments of the universe @xcite , which superluminally stretched a tiny patch to become our observable universe today , and in the meantime makes the quantum fluctuations in the horizon leave the horizon to become the primordial perturbations responsible for the formation of cosmological structure @xcite .",
    "this is one of remarkable successes of inflation , see also the superinflation e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the null energy condition is broken . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was firstly noticed that there is an interesting case in the generating phases of primordial perturbations , in which the scale factor and thus the wavelengths of perturbations grows very slowly but the hubble length rapidly shrinks . the inflation can be generally regarded as an accelerated or superaccelerated stage , and so may defined as an epoch when the comoving hubble length decreases .",
    "this length starts out very large , and then the inflation forces it to shrink enough so that the perturbations can be generated causally . in a decelerated expanding background the comoving hubble length",
    "is increased , thus in this case it seems hardly possible to causally explain the origin of primordial perturbations .",
    "the variable speed of light @xcite has been considered , however , also see ref .",
    "@xcite for a reexamination .",
    "note that it has been illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the existence of adiabatic perturbations on scales much larger than the hubble radius implies that either inflation occurred in the past , the perturbations were there as initial conditions , or causality is broken .",
    "thus if we want to obtain the primordial perturbations in a decelerated expanding phase , we have to require that the scalar field responsible for the perturbations should have some special or modified dispersion relation .",
    "though there have been many detailed descriptions how the required dispersion relations are obtained from the effective field theory @xcite , it will be still significant to examine the feasibility of this seeding mechanism matched to the observable cosmology .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will show how the primordial perturbation may be generated during a decelerated expanding phase when the dispersion relation is modified . in this case , the perturbation spectrum is calculated in section iii .",
    "we discuss relevant difficulties in matching the spectrum to observable cosmology and possible solutions .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results , and as well as give some comments on future issues .",
    "in this section we will begin with a general discussion on the generation of causal primordial perturbations .",
    "the generation of primordial perturbations requires that the perturbation modes can leave the horizon during their generation and then reenter the horizon at late time .",
    "thus it may be convenient to define ( k_ek)(a_e h_e a h ) , [ caln]which measures the efolding number of mode with some scale @xmath0 which leaves the horizon before the end of the generating phase of perturbations , see ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath1 is the comoving wave number , and the subscript ` @xmath2 ' denotes the end time of the generating phase of perturbations , thus @xmath3 is the last mode to be generated , and @xmath4 is the hubble parameter , where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time . when taking @xmath5 , where the subscript ` 0 ' denotes the present time",
    ", we will obtain the efolding number required by observable cosmology . in this case , eq.([caln ] ) is actually the ratio of the physical wavelength corresponding to the present observable scale to that at the end of the generating phase of perturbations .",
    "the evolution of scale factor in the expanding background can be simply taken as @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 , ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we will assume that @xmath10 is a constant for simplicity .",
    "in the conformal time @xmath11 , we obtain @xmath12 .",
    "thus we have a~(n(n-1 ) a h)^n1-n.[ah]to produce the efolding number , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath14 must increase with time , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath16 for @xmath17 , which corresponds to the accelerated expanding phases , in which @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 , which corresponds to the superaccelerated expanding phases , in which @xmath21 , e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite . can be very interesting @xcite and was studied in detail in the island universe model @xcite .",
    "] taking the logarithm in both sides of ( [ ah ] ) , we obtain = ( 1-nn ) .",
    "[ ahi ] this equation can be also applied to the expansion with arbitrary constant @xmath10 .",
    "we plot fig.1 , in which and also in the whole note we have assumed that after the generating phases of primordial perturbations ends , the  reheating \" will rapidly occur and then bring the universe back to the usual frw evolution . here",
    "the reheating means a transition that the fields or fluids dominating the background decay into radiation .     with respect to the scale factor @xmath22 during the generation of perturbations .",
    "the left side of @xmath23 is the generating phase of perturbations , in which in the region above the @xmath22 axis the green dashed line corresponding the usual exponential inflation with @xmath24 divides this region into the superaccelerated phase ( up right ) in which @xmath19 and the accelerated phase ( lower left ) in which @xmath16 .",
    "the perturbation modes ( black dashed lines ) with the wave number @xmath1 can leave the hubble horizon during their generations and then reenter the horizon during the radiation / matter domination at late time . in principle",
    "it is hardly possible to obtain the causal primordial perturbations in a decelerated expanding phases in which @xmath25 , see the region below the @xmath22 axis , since there are nothing leaving the horizon during their evolutions .",
    "however , when we introduce the scalar field with the modified dispersion relation @xmath26 , the similar case to inflation can be imitated in a decelerated expanding phases . in this case",
    "the comoving wave number of perturbations will not unchange any more .",
    "this makes the evolution of their physical wavelengths able to be faster than that of @xmath27 when the condition @xmath28 is satisfied , see the black line and green line . , width=264 ]    we can see in fig.1 that in principle one can not obtain the primordial perturbations in the decelerated expanding phases in which @xmath25 , however , introducing the modified dispersion relation can change this point .",
    "the usual dispersion relation may be generally expected to receive some corrections with the increase of energy , which in some sense can be regarded as a phenomenological description of high energy new physics , see ref .",
    "these modifications has been applied to the early universe , especially the inflation cosmology , in which the modified dispersion relation can significantly affect the spectrum of primordial perturbations generated during inflation @xcite .",
    "the modified dispersion relation can also naturally arise from generally covariant scalar field @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , in the conformal time , one can introduce a projector @xmath29 , which projects onto the space orthogonal to a timelike vector @xmath30 and satisfies @xmath31 and @xmath32 . thus one may write @xmath29 as @xmath33 . by the help of the projection tensor",
    ", we can define a spatial derivative as @xmath34 , which is orthogonal to @xmath35 and so has only spatial components , and a time derivative @xmath36 . in principle , by combining these two generally covariant derivatives , one can obtain any combination of time and spatial derivatives , so any dispersion relation when acting on a scalar field . for example , if the spatial component of scalar field lagrangian is as follows @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constant , we will have the dispersion relation = k^qa^p.[omega]here for our purpose we will not pay more attentions to the relevant discussions on the modified dispersion relation .",
    "we in the following will focus on the primordial perturbations of the scalar field with the dispersion relation ( [ omega ] ) in a decelerated expanding background .",
    "we firstly begin with a simple modification as follows @xmath40 , where @xmath38 is the constant , and when @xmath41 , it recovers to the normal one .",
    "note also that this case in some sense is similar to that of the fluid with the decaying sound speed @xcite . to make a matching to the observable cosmology ,",
    "it is convenient to define an equivalent  efolding number \" .",
    "note that with above modification to the dispersion relation , the effective comoving wave number @xmath42 will not unchange any more during its evolution and has an extra suppress leaded by @xmath43 , and thus an increasing @xmath44 of the effective comoving wavelength , which directly effects the physical wavelength of correspondent mode . what the efolding number required by observable cosmology actually reflects is the ratio of the physical wavelength corresponding to the present observable scale to that at the end of the generating phase of perturbations , thus the change of physical wavelength induced by the shift of the comoving wave number must be included in the definition of the efolding number .",
    "thus similar to eq.([caln ] ) , the equivalent efolding number can be written as e^n(a_ea)^p ( k_ek ) .",
    "[ caln2]from eq.([ah ] ) , we have @xmath45 . thus substituting it and eq.([ah ] ) into eq.([caln2 ] ) , we can obtain @xmath46 . for an expanding universe with @xmath25",
    ", we can generally have @xmath47 .",
    "thus to make @xmath48 , which is required by the generation of primordial perturbations , @xmath28 must be satisfied . this can be reduced to @xmath16 for @xmath41 , which corresponds to the usual inflationary cases . in the expanding process , for the field with the normal dispersion relation , the physical wavelength of its modes @xmath49 , and",
    "only when the evolution of @xmath50 is faster than that of @xmath27 , can the primordial perturbations be generated , which can only be implemented in the cases of @xmath16 and @xmath19 ( here @xmath51 ) .",
    "however , for the field with the modified dispersion relation @xmath52 , the physical wavelength of correspondent modes is @xmath53 , thus even if for @xmath25 it is also possible that the evolution of physical wavelength is faster than that of @xmath27 , which leads that the correspondent modes can leave the horizon and thus the generation of primordial perturbation , see fig.1 for an illustration .",
    "in fact the condition @xmath28 means that in fig.1 the lines of @xmath1 modes must be intersected with that of @xmath54 , i.e. the green line , in the past .",
    "if @xmath55 , the intersection will be expected to be in infinite far position of lower left side of fig.1 , and in this case the scale of @xmath56 will be required to be very high .",
    "note that @xmath56 can be taken to planck scale at most and in principle @xmath57 has also a lower limit , thus generally @xmath58 should be far away from 0 in order to obtain enough efolding number .",
    "in this section we will calculate the primordial perturbations spectrum of scalar field with modified dispersion relation .",
    "we assume that this scalar field @xmath59 dose not affect the evolution of the background . in the momentum space ,",
    "the motion equation of @xmath59 is given by u_k^ + ( ^2-f ( ) ) u_k = 0 , [ uk]where @xmath60 is related to the perturbation of @xmath59 by @xmath61 and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath11 , and @xmath42 is given by eq.([omega ] ) with @xmath62 , and generally since @xmath63 , which is different from the usual case with @xmath64 constant , thus by using the mathematics handbook about deformed bessel equation , @xmath65 is required to be written as f ( ) , [ feta]where @xmath66 is generally required to be nearly constant so that eq.([uk ] ) is solvable , and is determined by the evolution of background and the details of @xmath59 field , such as its mass , its coupling to the background , and @xmath67 is determined by the behavior of @xmath68 . conventionally , the dispersion relation of scalar field is @xmath64 , which corresponds to @xmath62 and @xmath41 , and thus @xmath69 . when @xmath70 , we have r. [ r]the general solutions of this equation are the hankel functions with the order @xmath66 and the variable @xmath71 . in the regime",
    "@xmath72 , the modes can be regarded as adiabatic .",
    "the reason is that note that @xmath73 , thus the adiabatic condition @xmath74 is equivalent to @xmath72 . note also that @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 , and thus obtain @xmath77 , which corresponds to the case that the effective physical wavelength is very deep into the horizon .",
    "thus in this regime we may take u_k as an approximate solution of eq.([uk ] ) , which in some sense is similar to the case in which the initial condition can be taken as usual minkowski vacuum .",
    "note that @xmath78 will decrease with the expansion .",
    "thus at late time , we can expect @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 . the expansion of hankel functions to the leading term of @xmath71 gives k^3/2|_k | ~k^3/2-v , [ kuk]where the other factors without @xmath1 have been neglected .",
    "thus to obtain the scale invariant spectrum , @xmath81 is required .      for the massless scalar field",
    ", we have @xmath82 . note that @xmath83 , and then use eqs.([feta ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , we can obtain v=12|3n-1n(p+1)-1| .",
    "[ v]if @xmath41 , eq.([v ] ) will be reduced to the normal case , in which when @xmath24 we can obtain @xmath81 and thus a scale invariant spectrum , which is familiar result in the inflation . from above discussions",
    "we have known that @xmath58 is require to be larger than @xmath84 for the generation of primordial perturbations .",
    "thus in eq.([v ] ) taking @xmath85 required by the scale invariant spectrum , we have n(p+1)-1= |n-13 |.substituting it to @xmath86 leaded by eq.([caln2 ] ) , we obtain = |n-13 |(h_ih_e ) , [ nl]where the subscript ` @xmath87 ' denotes the beginning time of the generating phase of perturbations .",
    "note that in eq.([nl ] ) , the efolding number is not related with @xmath38 , which is also actually valid for the case with arbitrary spectrum , though we are constrained to that with the scale invariant spectrum and then obtain eq.([nl ] ) .",
    "thus since @xmath88 , we see that to obtain enough efolding number required by observable cosmology , the ratio @xmath89 to @xmath57 must be large enough . note that @xmath89 has an upper limit , i.e. the planck scale , thus it seems that @xmath57 must be taken very low .    the efolding number required",
    "is generally determined by the evolution after reheating . in principle",
    "the lower energy density is when the generating phase of perturbations is over , the smaller the efolding number required is . for an idealistic case ,",
    "in which after the generating phases of perturbations ends the universe will rapidly be linked to an usual frw evolution , one can have @xmath90 @xcite . instituting it into ( [ nl ] )",
    ", we can cancel @xmath86 and obtain a relation between @xmath57 and @xmath10 .",
    "we plot fig.2 in which for various @xmath10 in the region @xmath91 , the @xmath92 required are given .",
    "we can see that when taking the initial energy scale as planck scale and the end scale as nucleosynthesis scale , in which we have @xmath93 , in order to obtain enough efolding number , @xmath94 is required , while when the end scale lies in tev scale , we have @xmath95",
    ". we may also consider slightly red spectrum i.e. @xmath96 , as was favored mildly by wmap @xcite . from eqs.([caln2 ] ) and ( [ v ] ) , we see that the value of @xmath10 will be required to be larger .",
    "these results indicate that generally it seems slightly difficult to satisfy simultaneously the conditions required by the enough efolding number and the scale invariant spectrum , since the @xmath57 required must be very low and in the meantime @xmath10 is generally constrained in a cabined region .",
    "this makes some familiar phases , e.g. the radiation phase and the matter phase , hardly be included in possible applications .",
    "we may introduce the more general dispersion relation , e.g. change the power of @xmath1 , as in eq.([omega ] ) with @xmath97 .",
    "however , it seems not helpful to relax the above difficult , since this only equals to bring a factor proportional to @xmath98 in @xmath86 obtained from eq.([caln2 ] ) and the denominator of eq.([v ] ) simultaneously .",
    "they will be generally set off in the calculations obtaining the eq.([nl ] ) .",
    "thus to solve the above problem , we must assure that the modifications introduced dose not change @xmath86 obtained from eq.([caln2 ] ) and the denominator of eq.([v ] ) simultaneously .",
    "with respect to @xmath10 in order to obtain enough efolding number .",
    "the horizonal axis is @xmath10 .",
    "the solid line is the case of @xmath99 and the dashed line is that of @xmath100 .",
    "the region above the corresponding line is that with enough efolding number .",
    "the red line corresponds to the maximal reheating temperature at @xmath57 epoch where @xmath89 is taken as planck scale .",
    ", width=302 ]      when the scalar field is massive , @xmath65 is given by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 has been defined , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details on the spectrum of massive scalar field with normal dispersion relation .",
    "note that @xmath83 , thus we can obtain @xmath65 , where @xmath103 has been used .",
    "note that @xmath104 , i.e. it generally changes with the time in the decelerated expanding phase , thus @xmath105 is generally not constant and so the numerator of @xmath65 , which will make us very difficult to obtain the analytic solution of eq.([uk ] ) .",
    "thus we need to fix @xmath105 constant , which can be done by introducing a non - minimally coupling @xmath106 between @xmath59 and gravity , where @xmath107 is the ricci curvature scalar . in this case",
    ", we will have that @xmath108 , and so @xmath105 can be a constant .",
    "thus eq.([uk ] ) becomes solvable exactly . from @xmath65 , and then using eqs.([feta ] ) and ( [ r ] ) , we can obtain v^2_m = v^2-(nn(p+1)-1 ) ^2 [ v2]which is used to replace @xmath66 in eq.([kuk ] ) , where the subscript @xmath109 denotes the value of @xmath66 for the massive scalar field .",
    "the scale invariance of spectrum requires @xmath110 , thus with eq.([v2 ] ) , we can obtain n(p+1)-1=. [ v22]note that the term inside sqrt in eq.([v22 ] ) should be larger than 0 , which suggests @xmath111 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the range of @xmath112 lies between @xmath84 and @xmath113 .",
    "thus to obtain enough efolding number , @xmath114 is generally required , which corresponds to introduce a scalar field with negative mass term . substituting eq.([v2 ] ) into @xmath115",
    "obtained from eq.([caln2 ] ) , we can obtain =( ) ( h_ih_e ) .",
    "[ nm ] thus one can see that to satisfy the requirements of observable cosmology , for the decelerated expanding phase with @xmath25 , the enough efolding number may be obtained by properly selecting the value of @xmath105 in the case with fixed @xmath10 in eq.([nm ] ) , while when @xmath10 and @xmath105 are fixed by eq.([nm ] ) , the scale invariant spectrum may be obtain by properly matching the value of @xmath38 in eq.([v2 ] ) .",
    "we plot fig.3 , in which for arbitrary @xmath10 in the region @xmath91 , in order to obtain enough efolding number , the @xmath116 required with respect to @xmath10 is given .",
    "we can see that for different value of @xmath10 , @xmath116 lies in an acceptable region and in the meantime @xmath117 is not required to be very large , which is from the case with the massless scalar field .",
    "note that both cases in fig.3 can not be implemented in the massless field , in which the value of @xmath117 in fig.3 is not so large to ensure enough efolding number .",
    "with respect to @xmath10 in order to obtain enough efolding number .",
    "the vertical axis is @xmath116 and the horizonal axis is @xmath10 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the case of @xmath100 and @xmath118 tev , and the dashed line is that of @xmath119 and @xmath120.,width=302 ]",
    "the modification of the dispersion relation of the scalar field brings a possibility generating the primordial perturbations in a decelerated expanding background , however , we find that in order to generate a nearly scale invariant spectrum , it will be slightly difficult to obtain enough efolding number required by the observable cosmology in a simple case .",
    "but when we consider more general cases , e.g. the massive scalar field , the problem can be relaxed .",
    "thus though the conditions required look like slightly special , it seems possible to seed the nearly scale invariant primordial perturbations within a conventional evolution not involving the inflation .",
    "these perturbations may be transferred to the curvature perturbations at late time by some mechanisms , e.g. as in refs .",
    "@xcite , thus may be interesting and responsible for the structure formation of observable universe .",
    "note that current observations actually favor a red tilt spectrum @xcite , but not exact scale invariant one .",
    "however , this does not pose any problem here , since we can always set any value of @xmath38 in eq.([v ] ) or ( [ v2 ] ) to obtain the @xmath66 or @xmath121 required by the red tilt of spectrum , even the blue tilt . in principle there is not the generation of primordial gravitational wave , since the seeding of scalar perturbation occurs during a decelerated expansion , unless the sound speed of the gravitational wave is also time dependent , as in the case of scalar perturbation .",
    "non - gaussianity is expected to be small .",
    "however , we still need to a detailed discussion on the gravitational wave and non - gaussianity in order to match the coming observable tests . in addition , since the energy scale when the generating phase of primordial perturbations ends may be very low to tev , even bbn scale , it is also interesting to study whether there are some observable effect on e.g. baryogenesis .",
    "thus it seems that many significant issues related to this work remain .",
    "we expect to back to these studies in the future .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that such a decelerated evolution of early universe can not solve all problems of standard cosmology , as has been explained in the inflation models .",
    "for example , here initially the homogeneity in the superhubble scale must be imposed .",
    "be that as it may , however , this work displays an  unnatural \" but possible example seeding a phenomenologically realistic spectrum of primordial perturbations in a non - accelerated expanding background , which to some extent highlights the fact again that identifying the origin of primordial perturbations may be a much more subtle task than expected .    * acknowledgments * the author would like to thank c. armendariz - picon for discussions .",
