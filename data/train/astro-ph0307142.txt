    "the intrinsic absorbing column density is only moderate ; it increases for the smaller extraction radius [ going from @xmath32 to @xmath33 @xmath4 ] , which suggests contamination by a soft possibly thermal component outside the @xmath22 radius .",
    "the @xmath35 from the @xmath22 data is consistent with that from the analysis of the snapshot acis - s exposure and marginally higher than the bepposax value , which can easily be due to the difference in the extraction radius .",

    "we can set an upper limit on the equivalent width ( ew ) of this line of @xmath41 ev , for a narrow line , and of 296 ev for a broad gaussian line with line width @xmath42 kev ( as found on average for seyfert 1 s by @xcite ) .",
    "we have not used the 18.7 ks exposure acis - s data for the spectral analysis of the nucleus because they are strongly affected by pile - up .",

    "spectra extracted from three elliptical annuli centered on the nucleus were compared with the spectra expected from the superposition along the line of sight of the emission coming from the corresponding ellipsoidal shells .",
    "the elliptical annuli have a major / minor axis ratio of 1.5 , equal to that of the sombrero s bulge .",
    "to avoid contamination from the nucleus , we chose as inner boundary of the first annulus a @xmath43 circle ; its outer boundary is an ellipse with semiminor axis of @xmath45 and semimajor axis of @xmath46 .",
    "the outer boundary of the second annulus has a semiminor axis of @xmath47 and a semimajor axis of @xmath48 .",
    "the third annulus has as outer boundary an ellipse with semiminor axis of @xmath49 and a semimajor axis of @xmath50 . from these annuli we subtracted clearly visible point sources .",
    "assuming that the emission comes from hot gas plus residual contamination from unresolved binaries ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtained deprojected density and temperature profiles by fitting together the spectra of the 3 annuli with the xspec model _ projct*wabs(raymond+powerlaw)_. the power law index was fixed at @xmath51 , @xmath26 was fixed at the galactic value and the temperature and normalizations were free parameters .",
    "the resulting temperature and density profiles are shown in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "the above calculation was next used to derive an estimate of the mass supply rate for accretion on the smbh , by applying the bondi ( 1952 ) theory of steady , spherical and adiabatic accretion .",
    "this requires @xmath52 and @xmath53 at `` infinity '' , in practice near the accretion radius ( that in the case of sombrero is @xmath54 pc , with @xmath55 the sound speed ) .",
    "the inner radius of the innermost annulus ( @xmath56 pc ) is a factor of @xmath57 larger than @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , the temperature and density profiles show a sharp positive gradient toward smaller radii . therefore , in order to have an estimate of the bondi mass accretion rate ( @xmath59 ) , an extrapolation of the @xmath39 and @xmath53 values at @xmath58 is required . since the uncertainties on these values are large ( fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) , we derived for @xmath60 the maximum range allowed by the uncertainties , via a linear extrapolation of the outer @xmath61 data that also considers their errorbars . from the formula @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the smbh mass in units of @xmath64 ( for sombrero @xmath65 ,",

    "the best fit temperature and density values of the innermost annulus ( @xmath71 kev ; @xmath72 @xmath68 ) give @xmath73 yr@xmath6 .",
    "we discuss here possible scenarios to explain the very sub - eddington luminosity of the sombrero s nucleus , using the results of our analysis of high quality x - ray data and information coming from high angular resolution observations in other bands .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the sombrero s nucleus is @xmath74 erg s@xmath6 [ obtained by integrating the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in fig .",
    "[ sed ] ] , that is @xmath75 .",
    "this very sub - eddington nuclear luminosity could be explained by compton thick material surrounding the nucleus and heavily absorbing the x - ray emission , as in seyfert  2 galaxies .",
    "however , as observed in similar nuclei ( e.g. , ic  1459 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though not with the high xmm s sensitivity that we can exploit here , the spectral characteristics of the emission are not consistent with this picture .",
    "there is no sign of heavy obscuration and the small amount of absorption needed for modeling the spectrum could be explained by intervening dust : an @xmath9 v ",
    "i image shows a dusty nuclear environment @xcite , for which @xcite derive @xmath76=0.5 mag ( that corresponds to an intrinsic @xmath77 @xmath4 , for the galactic extinction law ) .",
    "moreover , the upper limit on the equivalent width of fe - k emission at 6.4 kev ( ew@xmath78 ev , sect .",
    "3 ) rules out the presence of a strong 6.4 kev iron fluorescence line , of ew@xmath79 kev , that is expected in the compton thick scenario ( as in ngc1068 ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "absence of high extinction is also supported by the @xmath9 fos spectra in the uv band @xcite .",
    "this nucleus shows some similarities with the observed emission properties of luminous agns : an x - ray / radio luminosity ratio comparable with the extrapolation of the bright radio galaxy correlation @xcite ; a spectral power law consistent with that of seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite ; 210 kev and @xmath10 luminosities consistent with the low luminosity extension of the @xmath80 correlation found for powerful seyfert 1 nuclei and quasars @xcite .    however , its bolometric luminosity is well below what we would expect from efficient accretion of the available fuel .",
    "the smbh is surrounded by hot gas whose density and temperature can be measured close to the accretion radius .",
    "if at very small radius this gas joins an accretion disc with a standard radiative efficiency @xmath81 , as in brighter agns , it should produce a luminosity : @xmath82 for the range of @xmath83 at the accretion radius estimated in sect .",
    "this is at least @xmath8 times higher than the observed @xmath84 , which represents a strong argument against a thin disc in this nucleus .",
    "an additional argument could be that its sed ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) lacks the ` blue bump ' ( uv / blue excess ) observed in luminous agns and attributed to the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "this lack is a feature common to other low luminosity agns @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral energy distribution of a multicolor black body accretion disc , with a mass accretion rate in the range estimated in sect . 4 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 m@xmath87 , shows a peak at a frequency of @xmath88 hz , which is redder than in the b and u bands .    besides the very low luminosity ,",
    "inconsistent with efficient disc accretion , there are other properties in which the sombrero s nucleus differs from seyfert 1 s nuclei : ( 1 ) the latter exhibit iron k emission lines produced in the accretion disc , whose strength clearly increases with decreasing x - ray luminosity ; the average ew of the 6.4 kev emission ( for a broad gaussian fit ) is @xmath89 ev at an x - ray luminosity of few@xmath90 erg s@xmath6 @xcite , while our analysis gives an upper limit of ew@xmath91 ev at a much lower luminosity ( sect .",
    "( 2 ) seyferts show evidence for x - ray flux variability , with the amplitude anticorrelated with the source luminosity @xcite .",
    "neither short term nor long term variability has been detected in or between our and previous x - ray observations of the sombrero s nucleus @xcite . in the 18ks acis - s data we have looked for variability to take full advantage of the unprecedented angular resolution .",
    "the pileup does not affect the temporal variation ( as we expect a constant fraction of x - rays migrating from low energies to higher energies ) .",
    "we have applied a traditional time - binned histogram analysis and a bayesian block technique for unbinned data , which was developed for the @xmath1 multi - wavelength project ( kim et al .",
    "2003 ) . in both tests",
    "we do not find any statistically significant variability .",
    "the xmm flux ( @xmath92 kev)@xmath93 erg s@xmath6 @xmath4 ) is also consistent with that given by the @xmath1 snapshot data ( @xmath92 kev)@xmath94 erg s@xmath6 @xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "the somewhat larger flux estimated from the asca and bepposax data is entirely consistent with the much larger aperture used in these cases .",
    "( 3 ) finally , the small @xmath35 derived from the xmm data is inconsistent with the absence of prominent broad line emission @xcite , which contrasts with the predictions of the unification models of bright seyfert nuclei @xcite .",
    "an alternative possibility is that accretion proceeds at a rate not far from @xmath85 but with a low radiative efficiency , through an advection dominated optically thin quasi spherical hot accretion flow ( adaf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in these models , unlike in the standard , radiatively efficient , thin disc models , very little of the gravitational potential energy of the inflowing gas is radiated away and accretion lacks the cold , optically thick gas required for the emission of the fluorescent 6.4 kev fe - k line .",
    "the majority of the observable emission is in the x - ray and in the radio bands . in the x",
    "- rays it comes from thermal bremsstrahlung with a flat power law ( @xmath95 in the @xmath1 band ) or inverse compton scattering of soft synchrotron photons by the flow electrons , with a steeper x - ray spectral shape ( e.g. , @xmath96 has been used to model the nucleus of m87 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the radio band ,",
    "synchrotron emission arises from the strong magnetic field in the inner parts of the accretion flow .",
    "detailed adaf modeling has been applied many times to low luminosity agns and normal ellipticals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of a fluorescent fe line from cold material and the observed x - ray photon index of the sombrero s nucleus are in accordance with the adaf predictions",
    ". also , the radio emission from an adaf scales with the smbh mass and the x - ray luminosity as @xmath97erg s@xmath98 erg s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this relation gives a predicted @xmath99 erg s@xmath6 for sombrero .",
    "vlbi measurements @xcite reveal a flat spectrum core source with @xmath100 erg s@xmath6 , therefore the radio  to  x - rays ratio agrees with the predictions of the basic adaf .",
    "however , an adaf modeling tailored to the sombrero nucleus , and using a range of @xmath101 yr@xmath6 that includes the range found here , showed that the adaf synchrotron emission overestimates significantly ( by as much as a factor of @xmath102 ) the observed radio flux @xcite .    more recent work on radiatively inefficient accretion has revealed that little mass available at large radii is actually accreted on the smbh and most of it is lost to an outflow or circulates in convective motions @xcite .",
    "if the density is lower in the inner flow regions , the synchrotron emission in the radio band is drastically reduced . in the case of sombrero ,",
    "strong mass loss with only a few percent of @xmath85 actually accreted on the smbh helps reconcile the model with the observations _ in the radio _ band @xcite .",
    "however , in these models the radio  to  x - rays ratio changes with respect to the basic adaf predictions , in the sense that outflows or convection suppress the radio emission more than the x - ray one @xcite . therefore , if these models are normalized to match the observed x - ray luminosity of the sombrero s nucleus , they will exhibit a deficit of radio emission with respect to the observations . in this picture , an additional radio source ( e.g. , a nuclear jet ) could solve the discrepancy .",
    "the presence of jets was suggested by @xcite , who in fact best reproduced the flat radio spectral shape of the sombrero s nucleus with self - absorbed synchrotron emission originating from a compact region ( while the adaf synchrotron radiation has an inverted spectrum up to high radio frequencies , above which it abruptly drops ) .    in conclusion , even in the case of low radiative efficiency the mass accretion rate on the smbh must be less than @xmath85 to match the observed emission level .",
    "note that the @xmath1 upper limits on the x - ray nuclear luminosities of three ellipticals also require strong outflows or convection in an adaf @xcite ; and this could be the case also for the nucleus of m32 @xcite .",
    "note finally that a few other low luminosity agns exhibit an excess of radio emission relative to the predictions of low radiative efficiency models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent radio observations show that a strong jet presence is a common feature of liners @xcite and recent modeling of low luminosity agns @xcite suggests that the higher wavelengths may also be dominated by the jet emission . in this modeling the accretion flow can be described either by a standard shakura - sunyaev disc or an adaf , and a fraction of the accretion flow is advected into a jet , which represents an important component of the emission spectrum ( actually dominating in low luminosity sources ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite have argued that the @xcite mechanism might be most relevant for advection dominated flows .    in these models the synchrotron emission from the base of the jet produces a `` bump '' of emission from radio to high ir frequencies , peaking roughly at mid - ir .",
    "the flat / inverted radio synchrotron spectrum comes from further out in the jet .",
    "its optically thin part , plus self - comptonized emission and external compton emission from the jet , produce the x - ray spectrum .",
    "a flat radio spectrum @xcite and a peak in the ir region are features shown by the sed of the sombrero s nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ sed ] ) .",
    "moreover , such a jet dominated model has been applied recently to explain the whole spectral energy distribution of the liner in the elliptical galaxy ic1459 @xcite .",
    "similarly to the sombrero s nucleus , the x - ray emission of ic1459 is modeled with an unabsorbed power law of @xmath103 ( using the @xmath1 acis - s data ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this modeling the jets are by far the dominant sink of power , in the form of kinetic and internal energy , to the point that @xmath104 could be stored in them .",
    "a similar fraction was estimated for the jet power in the case of the fri galaxy ic4296 , using again acis - s data to estimate @xmath105 plus a direct calculation of the jet kinetic power , instead of a modeling of the sed @xcite .      alternatively to the possibilities described in the previous section",
    ", the mass supply to the central smbh could be much lower than estimated in sect .",
    "4 , because accretion is not an adiabatic process and perhaps it is not even steady .",
    "this is the case of feedback modulated accretion models where the interstellar medium is heated by the energy input from a central source that decreases or stops recursively the accretion on the central smbh , giving raise to cycles of activity .",
    "such a scenario has been argued several times over the last decade : the ism could be heated by the impact of collimated outflows @xcite or by inverse compton scattering of hard photons @xcite , both coming from the central nucleus .",
    "therefore , accretion is only episodic , and between phases of accretion activity is switched off with a low nuclear luminosity . in the @xcite scenario , at the present time the duty cycle of activity includes short bright phases followed by prolongued periods of readjustment  of the gas surrounding the nucleus , so that only 1/@xmath106 to 1/@xmath107 nuclei in the nearby universe should be caught in the bright agn phase .",
    "signatures of the central heating include disturbances in the x - ray isophotes of the gas . in sombrero , the x - ray isophotes in the circumnuclear region shown by the acis - s image ( fig .",
    "[ imachandra ] ) do not reveal clear disturbances from nuclear outflows / hard photons heating the ism with respect to a round distribution .",
    "however , this aspect is difficult to assess given the crowding of stellar sources close to the center and it is under study .",
    "the same holds for the possible presence of temperature variations in the circumnuclear region .",
    "we just note three observational facts that certainly contrast with the predictions of a global `` cooling flow '' in this bulge : a ) the hot gas temperature shows an increase close to the center , instead of a smoothly decreasing profile ( fig .",
    "6 ) , even though the errors are large to establish firmly that central heating is occurring ; b ) the mass accretion rate @xmath85 , although derived for a steady and adiabatic case that may not apply , is already much less than the stellar mass loss rate @xmath108 in this bulge [ @xmath109 m@xmath87 yr@xmath6 from the prescriptions of the stellar evolution theory , e.g. , inserting the bulge luminosity @xmath110 @xcite in eq .",

    "a detailed analysis and modeling of the status of the hot gas on the galactic scale is in progress .",
    "by exploiting xmm s sensitivity and @xmath1 s high angular resolution we have studied the x - ray properties of the nucleus of the sombrero galaxy .",
    "we have then examined various possibilities for the observed low level of activity shown by this well known liner , and these can be summarized as follows :      @xmath113 the nuclear bolometric luminosity is at least @xmath8 times lower than expected if the central smbh accreted matter at the rate predicted by the steady , spherical and adiabatic bondi accretion theory , with the high radiative efficiency of a standard accretion disc",
    ". therefore , the final stages of accretion are not radiatively efficient and/or the mass supply on the smbh is far less .",
    "@xmath113 in a radiatively inefficient accretion scenario , where the rate of accreting mass is close to the bondi estimate , the model luminosity is higher than observed .",
    "including outflows or convection can fix this problem , but then , if the observed x - ray emission is accounted for , the radio luminosity is underreproduced",
    ". it could then come from nuclear jets .",
    "@xmath113 a jet dominated emission model , recently applied to a few other low luminosity agns , could perhaps explain the observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "if this model applies , a large fraction of the accretion luminosity @xmath105 could be stored in the form of jet power .    @xmath113",
    "another possibility is that accretion is not steady and adiabatic , therefore the bondi theory does not apply .",
    "that is , due to the presence of a central heating source , far less mass than predicted by the bondi accretion rate actually reaches the smbh .",
    "observed signatures of a central heating could be an increase in the temperature profile close to the nucleus and a low hot gas content for the bulge .",
    "@xmath113 in addition to the absence of a standard accretion disc , other important differences with the properties of luminous type 1 agns include the lack of flux variability and fe - k emission .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the xmm-@xmath0 and @xmath1 acis - s observations of the liner nucleus of the sombrero galaxy and we discuss possible explanations for its very sub - eddington luminosity by complementing the x - ray results with high angular resolution observations in other bands . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray investigation shows a hard ( @xmath2 ) and moderately absorbed ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) nuclear source of @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 in the 210 kev band , surrounded by hot gas at a temperature of @xmath7 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric nuclear luminosity is at least @xmath8 times lower than expected if mass accreted on the supermassive black hole , that @xmath9 shows to reside at the center of this galaxy , at the rate predicted by the spherical and adiabatic bondi accretion theory and with the high radiative efficiency of a standard accretion disc . </S>",
    "<S> the low luminosity , coupled to the observed absence of fe - k emission in the nuclear spectrum , indicates that such a disc is not present . </S>",
    "<S> this nucleus differs from bright unobscured agns also for the lack of high flux variability and of prominent broad @xmath10 emission . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also too faint for the predictions of simple radiatively inefficient accretion taking place at the bondi rate ; it could be too radio bright , instead , for radiatively inefficient accretion that includes strong mass outflows or convection . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy could be solved by the possible presence of nuclear radio jets . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative explanation of the low luminosity , in place of radiative inefficiency , could be unsteady accretion . </S>"
