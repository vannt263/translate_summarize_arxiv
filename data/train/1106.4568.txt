    "indirect dark matter detection is the search for the annihilation or decay products of particle dark matter  instead of _ directly _ detecting the dark matter , _ indirect _ detection aims at pinpointing the non - standard origin of a cosmic - ray or a gamma - ray signal based upon the messenger s spectral or angular features ( see the relevant chapters of ref .",
    "@xcite for a collection of recent reviews ) .",
    "examples of indirect detection with gamma rays are searches for a peculiar gamma - ray signal from nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) , from nearby clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) , from the center of the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) , in the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( e.g. @xcite ) or in the diffuse background angular distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) ; high - energy neutrinos from the center or of the sun or of the earth ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the search for features in the spectrum of positrons or antiprotons ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the search for antidetuerons ( e.g. @xcite ) are further examples of indirect dark matter detection channels .",
    "this is an especially exciting point in time for the field of indirect dark matter detection .",
    "the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) is well into its third , successful year of science operations .",
    "crucial aspects of the gamma - ray sky for indirect dark matter searches , such as the issue of the galactic and extra - galactic diffuse background , are undergoing close scrutiny with significant progress well under - way @xcite .",
    "research and development is also in progress for the next generation gamma - ray detector , a ground - based cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , whose significantly lower low - energy threshold will enormously benefit its use for dark matter searches .",
    "the icecube neutrino telescope has recently been completed , with a thickly - instrumented portion ( deepcore ) that makes it an even better dark matter detection instrument than originally designed @xcite .",
    "finally , the ams-02 payload has recently been successfully deployed on - board the international space station , and science results will soon be delivered .    the weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm for the nature of dark matter is a highly compelling scenario , as it relies on generic weak - scale physics and on the well - known thermal freeze - out mechanism for the production of a relic with just the right density to match the inferred dark matter abundance in the universe .",
    "however , the so - called wimp miracle does not provide an explanation to why the universal density of baryons @xmath0 ( in units of the critical density , @xmath1 ) is tantalizingly close to the density of dark matter @xmath2 , so much as to pose the veritable `` coincidence problem '' of explaining why @xmath3 .",
    "a general class of models posits that the dark matter relic density is in fact set by an asymmetry between dark matter and anti - dark matter particles , in full similarity to the baryonic relic density ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if the two asymmetries are related to each other ( for example if there exists a `` transfer mechanism '' between the dark matter and the baryonic sector ) , then generically @xmath4 gev , with @xmath5 the proton mass and @xmath6 a model - dependent number of order unity .",
    "these models have been dubbed `` asymmetric dark matter '' models in ref .",
    "@xcite , and received a considerable amount of attention recently , in part because of direct detection results that might point to a light ( with a mass of a few gev ) dark matter candidate .",
    "while asymmetric dark matter models give rise to an interesting phenomenology ( see e.g. @xcite ) , including new contributions to proton decay , and , as mentioned , can even explain anomalies in direct dark matter experiments ( e.g. @xcite ) , by definition , asymmetric dark matter does not annihilate ( or does so at a very suppressed rate , should there be a left - over symmetric component ) .",
    "one might thus naturally wonder whether indirect dark matter detection is or not entirely doomed in asymmetric dark matter scenarios ( see however @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider a process that was , in an entirely different astrophysical setting , suggested some time ago by bloom and wells @xcite .",
    "there , the authors suggested that high - energy electrons in the jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) could up - scatter dark matter particles , possibly radiating a photon in the final state . estimating , with the techniques of effective field theory , the relevant cross section , and estimating the flux of electrons and the density of dark matter particles , the authors concluded that ( 1 ) the level of the signal was several orders of magnitude below the sensitivity of the lat , and ( 2 ) no specific `` smoking - gun '' spectral features were present in the signal .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we recently studied the same process originally proposed in @xcite , improving on the previous analysis in a number of ways .",
    "first , we carried out the complete elementary process calculation , including resonance and threshold effects , for two particle dark matter models ( supersymmetric neutralinos and the lightest kaluza - klein of universal extra dimensions ) for both cosmic - ray electrons and protons in the agn jet ; second , we re - evaluated the agn jet components and the dark matter density in view of recent observational and theoretical - modeling results .",
    "we concluded that the process can be resonant , and that the resonance entails on the one hand a larger final - state photon flux , and on the other hand a distinctive spectral feature , corresponding to a certain , well - understood kinematic condition . as a result",
    ", we predicted that for some dark matter models the process of dark matter scattering off of agn jet particles can be observable by the fermi lat .    here , we observe that our own galaxy is populated by cosmic rays ( hadrons and heavy nuclei , electrons , positrons and neutrinos ) that might interact with the galactic dark matter  a process that might be `` visible '' with a gamma - ray telescope such as fermi lat if it radiates a photon in the final state .",
    "evidently , the elementary processes we considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite are precisely the same for the case of scattering off of galactic cosmic rays ( albeit a few technical differences will be of importance , as we point out later ) . a further possibility , that we leave for future work",
    ", is that dark matter - cosmic ray scattering lead to inelastic processes producing e.g. neutral pions , eventually resulting in gamma rays .",
    "note that inelastic interactions between cosmic - ray protons and dark matter particles have been also recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite as a possible explanation to the origin of the observed `` knee '' in the spectrum of galactic cosmic rays , for dark matter models in the context of extra dimensions with a low fundamental scale of gravity .",
    "limits on the interaction cross section of dark matter off of hadronic cosmic rays have also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of models of strongly interacting dark matter ; the strongest constraints were found to arise from effects on the predicted abundances of light elements in big bang nucleosynthesis .    in this study we first consider , in sec .",
    "[ rough ] , the process of dark matter scattering off of cosmic rays in the galaxy for a generic wimp model , and we compare the expected luminosity from final - state radiated photons with what expected for wimp pair - annihilation ; we also consider the same process for two additional dark matter models that received some attention recently : dipolar dark matter and `` luminous '' dark matter .",
    "we then present the core of our numerical results in sec .",
    "[ core ] , and separately give details for the case of cosmic - ray electrons ( [ ele ] ) and protons ( [ pro ] ) .",
    "we present a discussion and our conclusions in the final sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "in this section we estimate , for generic wimp models as well as for dipolar and luminous dark matter models , the expected luminosity for the process where a photon is emitted in the final state of a cosmic - ray scattering off of dark matter .",
    "we start by comparing , for the case of ( symmetric ) wimp dark matter models where pair - annihilation can occur , the luminosity of the final - state photon emission from cosmic ray scattering off of dark matter to the well - known dark matter pair - annihilation rate .",
    "both processes can be thought of as occurring on the same target particles : galactic dark matter .",
    "we thus construct an order - of - magnitude estimate for the relevant rates , per unit target .",
    "these are defined here as follows :    * for dark matter annihilation , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the pair annihilation cross section , @xmath9 the number density , and @xmath10 the relative dark matter particle velocity in the galaxy * for cosmic ray - dark matter scattering , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the locally measured differential cosmic ray electron flux , averaged over angles , and @xmath13 the relevant scattering cross section .",
    "we estimate a weak - scale pair - annihilation cross section @xmath14 and we employ a local dark matter density @xmath15 and a dark matter mass of 100 gev to estimate @xmath16 . finally , we take @xmath17 . with these numbers ,",
    "we find @xmath18 for the case of cosmic ray - dark matter scattering we employ @xmath19 as measured and reported by the lat collaboration @xcite ( we consider cosmic - ray electron energies around 1 gev given that we are interested in final - state gamma rays with energies in the fermi lat range , thus above 0.1 gev , and because at larger energies the cosmic - ray spectrum declines very steeply ; we thus expect the energy range that contributes the most to the signal we are interested in to be in the gev range ) , and we estimate @xmath20 with possible resonances enhancing these numbers by 2 - 4 orders of magnitude , according to the findings of @xcite ( see e.g. fig .  3 ) . as a result , @xmath21 this calculation only employs the local dark matter density and cosmic - ray electron flux : both these quantities are larger the closer one gets to the center of the galaxy .",
    "this order of magnitude estimate , however , implies that in the generic case where the dark matter pair - annihilates and there are no symmetries or kinematic effects suppressing the natural pair - annihilation rate for a weak - scale weakly - interacting particle , the effect under investigation here is suppressed by 3 to 7 orders of magnitude compared to pair - annihilation .",
    "notice also that the number of photons produced in each _ annihilation event _ is typically on the order of 10 - 100 , as opposed to the single photon that scattering off of cosmic ray would produce _ per event _ ( an exception to this is given by inelastic processes leading to neutral pions in the final state ) .",
    "since the detectable quantity here is not the event - rate , but the actual gamma rays produced in the interactions , the suppression in the predicted gamma - ray flux is thus generically larger by a further 1 to 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "if , however , effects such as co - annihilation or velocity dependence of the pair - annihilation are in place , the two processes could produce a comparable flux of gamma rays .",
    "in addition , if dark matter can not pair - annihilate because of discrete symmetries or because of lack of annihilation partners , such as in asymmetric dark matter models @xcite , then scattering off of cosmic ray electrons with a final - state photon emission might be one , if not the only way to detect a signal from dark matter with gamma - ray telescopes .",
    "it is interesting to investigate two more dark matter scenarios that have received some attention recently : dipolar dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and luminous dark matter @xcite .",
    "the former arises as dark baryons in hidden - sector gauge mediation supersymmetry breaking ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or in technicolor models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while the relic density of this class of dark matter candidates is produced non - thermally , often a mechanism relates the dark baryon to the standard - model baryon density , thereby providing an explanation to the coincidence problem @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "luminous dark matter , on the other hand , is an interesting proposal in light of recent direct detection results @xcite .",
    "we estimate the dark matter scattering off of cosmic ray electrons for the case of dipolar dark matter assuming that the dark matter is a fermion @xmath23 of mass @xmath24 gev , with a dipolar interaction cross section of the type @xmath25 we estimate the cross section off of cosmic - ray electrons with a typical energy scale around 1 gev , and consider for simplicity the internal bremsstrahlung approximation of eq .",
    "( 17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for the final state photon radiation , with an outgoing photon energy on the gev range .",
    "notice that this process is never resonant .",
    "we obtain the estimate @xmath26 this entails that unless the dark sector scale @xmath27 is very low and the dark matter is very light the dipolar dark matter case is less promising than the wimp case .    in the context of luminous dark matter @xcite ,",
    "the dipolar operator connects two majorana fermions , @xmath28 ( the dark matter particle ) and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 gev and @xmath31 and @xmath32 kev chosen to provide an explanation to the observed dama / libra spectrum .",
    "the relevant interaction term is @xmath33 here the picture is one where scattering of @xmath28 off of cosmic ray via the dipolar interaction operator produces meta - stable @xmath29 particles , subsequently decaying into @xmath34 with the photon energy in the final state @xmath35 kev in the x - ray regime .",
    "we estimate the cross section for the process @xmath36 for @xmath37 gev to be on the order of @xmath38 this cross section would produce a rate of 3.3 kev x - ray photons per unit dark matter target of @xmath39 considering a galaxy similar to the milky way , and taking a total mass of @xmath40 , this leads to an x - ray luminosity of about @xmath41 which appears to be too small to be detectable if compared , for example , to the typical unresolved x - ray emission for a milky way - type galaxy of @xmath42 notice that the effective target number density is likely over - estimated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) , as one should really only consider dark matter particles within the diffusion region where galactic cosmic rays are confined .    one can also compare our estimate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) with the luminosity that would be produced by sterile neutrinos with a lifetime @xmath43 s and a mass of a few kev , which lie at the verge of the sensitivity of current x - ray data ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this case is relevant here since sterile neutrinos at that mass would produce exactly the same x - ray feature , a monochromatic line at an energy of a few kev .",
    "we estimate that the corresponding milky way x - ray luminosity would be on the order of @xmath44 we thus infer that the luminosity we estimate for luminous dark matter excitation from cosmic - ray scattering , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) , is well below the current x - ray telescope sensitivity .    in what follows",
    ", we shall focus on the case of wimps , motivated by the estimates above , and by the fact that if resonances are present , those can produce interesting and potentially revealing spectral features , such as those we found in the case of scattering of dark matter off of agn jet cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "in this section , we use the analytical results of ref .",

    "[ fig : diagram ] ) , since those are the only possibly resonant channels . using the same notation as in @xcite ,",
    "it is useful to remind the reader about the values of the coupling between electron ( quark ) - selectron ( squark ) - neutralino : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 the electric charge in units of @xmath59 , @xmath60 the standard model @xmath61 gauge coupling and @xmath62 the weinberg angle . @xmath63 and",

    "the cosmic rays do not have a fixed incoming direction , thus we want to keep the full kinematics unconstrained , and we integrate over the full solid angle . in doing so , we encounter two distinct logarithmic enhancements : ( i ) when the photon is collinear with the final electron , as in @xcite , and ( ii ) when the photon is collinear with the initial electron . notice that this integration is numerically non - trivial , as it runs over five independent variables , which can be taken to be the photon angle @xmath46 , the direction of the final state electron , and the energy of the initial state electron . we adopt here a monte carlo global adaptive integration strategy , as implemented in the mathematica package .",
    "we show our numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : electrons ] , where we employ , for the sake of illustration , low lightest - neutralino masses ( 10 and 50 gev ) and small separations between the mass of the lightest selectron and the lightest neutralino ( 0.5 and 1 gev ) .",
    "the mass difference sets the location of the kinematic condition that corresponds to the end of possible resonant effects . as a result",
    ", we find a sharp cutoff at 0.5 ( black line ) and at 1 gev ( red and green lines ) .",
    "notice that the drop - off is of about one order of magnitude .",
    "also , notice that the spectrum is significantly harder at energies below the kinematic drop - off , where it is slightly harder than @xmath66 . in principle",
    ", this might make this particular process distinguishable from the diffuse galactic background .",
    "also , from the standpoint of the angular distribution , this process is _ not _ isotropic , as the corresponding intensity correlates with the product of the cosmic - ray density times the dark matter density .",
    "finally , we note that the level of intensity we predict for the signal for the models under consideration is only 3 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the isotropic diffuse background @xcite .",
    "while a full - scale simulation of the detectability with fermi lat of the signal we calculated here is beyond the scope of the present analysis , we argue that the level of the gamma - ray emission predicted e.g. in the models illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : electrons ] might be potentially detectable . at a gamma - ray energy of around 1 gev , in the same units as in fig .",
    "[ fig : electrons ] , the extragalactic diffuse emission is at the level of @xmath67 , and has a very regular power - law spectrum @xcite .",
    "considering an angular region of interest of 1 sr , the lat effective area of @xmath68 at 1 gev @xcite , and an observing time of 3 years , @xmath69 s , this corresponds to a total number of isotropic background photons collected at energies around 1 gev on the order of @xmath70 , and a total number of signal events ( for e.g. the red line model of fig.[fig : electrons ] ) of around @xmath71 .",
    "this would correspond to a relatively low signal - to - noise ( for example , @xmath720.3 ) , but in principle an excess corresponding to the sharp spectral feature we predict here could be detectable with fermi lat .",
    "a further handle would be to correlate the detected , albeit with low statistical significance , bump with its angular distribution , that should trace the product of the dark matter times galactic cosmic - ray density .",
    "[ sec : prot ] in the case of protons , the calculation is carried out at the parton level first , with a subsequent integral over the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath73 .",
    "we thus consider = r__|j d_de_p dx _",
    "i = u , d f_i(x ) ( e_p , x ) , where the flux of cosmic ray protons = k_p ( ) ^-2.7 .",
    "the calculation is analogous to the one done in the electron case . for numerical purposes ,",
    "it is convenient to make the change of variables @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the energy of the incoming quark .",
    "doing so , there is no dependence on @xmath76 in the differential cross section and the integrals over @xmath76 and @xmath75 can be done separately .     and masses of the lightest quark - like scalar particle @xmath77.__,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    as we see in table [ tab : param ] , the normalization for the cosmic - ay proton flux is two orders of magnitude higher than the one for electrons .",
    "naively , one might thus hope to get a higher photon signal , but this is not actually the case .",
    "the coupling constants enter the cross section as @xmath78 , and because of the fractional electric charge of the quarks , almost two orders of magnitude are lost there .",
    "this is of course only a simple model - dependent accident . the further integration over the pdfs",
    ", however , also suppresses the signal , because having partons at a given energy requires having much larger proton energies , and the spectrum of cosmic - ray protons falls very steeply with energy .",
    "as a result , we find that the photon flux coming from proton scattering ends up being comparable to the flux from electron scattering for the particular case of supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "using again for illustrative purposes the case of supersymmetry , we choose three sets of lightest neutralino - lightest squark mass pairs in fig .",
    "[ fig : protons ] : @xmath79 gev . notice that , due to the integration over the parton distribution functions , the sharp drop - off we found for the cosmic - ray electron case is now smeared out over a broader range of photon energies , but is still noticeable .",
    "the overall normalization is still in a range which is , for some models , within 3 - 4 orders of magnitude of the isotropic gamma - ray background .",
    "notice that we find for the proton case a kinematical condition on the minimum quark energy which is completely analogous to the electron case @xcite e_q^min = , from which we see that the final photon energy can not exceed @xmath80 .",
    "that explains , for example , the sudden drop to zero at around 5 gev for the line with @xmath81 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig : protons ] .",
    "we studied the process of galactic cosmic - ray electron and proton scattering off of dark matter with the emission of a photon in the final state .",
    "we argued that the gamma - ray flux from this process is , for wimp models , suppressed compared to gamma rays from dark matter pair - annihilation .",
    "however , if the latter is in turn suppressed , or nonexistent as in asymmetric dark matter models , cosmic - ray - dark matter scattering can offer a unique opportunity for indirect dark matter searches with gamma rays .",
    "we find that , while for dipolar and luminous dark matter the intensity of the signal is well below detectability , for wimp models resonances can enhance the signal to a detectable level in principle .",
    "we illustrated the expected photon spectrum for the particular case of supersymmetric dark matter , and for a few particle dark matter and selectron / squark masses .",
    "we found that the resonant structure entails a sharp spectral drop - off , at energies corresponding to the mass difference between the selectron / squark and the lightest neutralino .",
    "the spectrum is harder than @xmath82 below the cutoff , and softer , and much more suppressed , at higher energies . in conclusion , while this process might be sub - dominant with respect to traditional searches for pair - annihilation signatures , it might still offer a unique chance of detecting indirectly dark matter with gamma - ray telescopes .",
