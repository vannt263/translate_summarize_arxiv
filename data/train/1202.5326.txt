    "<S> ( [ 31 ] ) there is no quantum state of the form ( [ 25 ] ) that can yield a wt going through @xmath115 , @xmath117 and @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact , implied by the propagator ( n10 ) , that there does not exist a wavepacket arriving in the neighborhood of @xmath72 at time @xmath17 that would have previously visited the neighborhoods of @xmath115 , @xmath117 and @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> the last remark highlights the incompatibility between the ` weak trajectories ' defined here by consecutive wm of the position and the ` average trajectories ' ( at ) defined by a wm of the _ momentum _ immediately postselected to a given position . by repeating these weak momentum measurements for different postselected positions , </S>",
    "<S> a velocity field is obtained .  </S>",
    "<S> the at are precisely the trajectories built on this velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> they have been experimentally observed recently for photons in a double slit setup @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> it was previously known @xcite that their dynamics is governed by the law of motion of the de broglie - bohm theory bohm , i.e. by the probability flow , whereas the wt are generated by the semiclassical propagator ( [ n10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mismatch @xcite between de broglie - bohm and classical trajectories in semiclassical systems hinges on the fact that when wavepackets interfere , the overall mean velocity field differs from the group velocity of each individual wavepacket . </S>",
    "<S> the mismatch is illustrated here in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) : we have computed numerically @xcite several at arriving in the neighborhood of @xmath123 .  </S>",
    "<S> these at go indeed through @xmath115 , @xmath124 and @xmath92 : starting near the origin , they first move in the vicinity of the guiding trajectory @xmath35 , then travel along trajectory @xmath34 and thereafter ` jump ' so as to move along trajectory @xmath33 .     and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> each of these pointers indicates a weak value @xmath125 : the evolution of the system along the reference trajectory @xmath33 has been measured weakly . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) : postselection now takes places at @xmath126 when the wavepackets return simultaneously to the origin . the postselected state ( defined in the text ) is plotted along with the pointers positioned along the reference trajectories @xmath127 _ all _ the meters yield weak values in agreement with their position along the relevant classical trajectory : the semiclassical sum over paths formulation has thus been measured weakly . </S>",
    "<S> , height=151 ]    finally , consider choosing postselection at @xmath128 when trajectories @xmath129 and @xmath35 first return to the origin , with the postselected state chosen as the superposition @xmath130 , with @xmath131 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 25 ) and @xmath132 , @xmath133 several pointers are positioned as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) . by construction the backward evolution of @xmath134 </S>",
    "<S> yields a superposition of wavepackets retracing trajectories @xmath135 and @xmath35 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore _ all _ the pointers will display a wv consistent with their position along one of the three trajectories , indicating the ` particle ' was there .  </S>",
    "<S> this is an experimentally realizable way to catch the essence of the path integral approach in the semiclassical regime : weakly interacting meters indicate the ` particle ' takes _ simultaneously _ all the available classical paths . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> a strong projective measurement would of course yield a definite outcome on only _ one _ of the paths .    to sum up </S>",
    "<S> , we have defined ` weak trajectories ' allowing to observe the paths taken by a quantum system in the semiclassical regime by direct weak measurements of the position . a consequence worth exploring concerns the possibility of employing this scheme to reconstruct the unknown propagator of a semiclassical system from the observed wt obtained from a grid of weak detectors while filtering postselected states . </S>",
    "<S> possible experimental realizations could be considered in systems in which wavepackets with a controlled dynamics can be engineered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present setup may also be used in designing pre - post selected quantum paradoxes containing dynamical ingredients . </S>"
