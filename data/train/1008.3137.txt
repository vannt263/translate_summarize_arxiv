    "boson stars are globally regular configurations of self - gravitating boson fields @xcite .",
    "when the complex scalar field has a suitable self - interaction , the boson stars possess a flat spacetime limit , representing non - topological solitons or @xmath0-balls , @xcite .",
    "these are stationary localized solutions with a finite mass , whose charge @xmath0 corresponds to their particle number .",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model also possess @xmath0-ball solutions @xcite . in this case",
    "several scalar fields interact via complicated potentials .",
    "it was shown that cubic interaction terms that result from yukawa couplings in the superpotential and supersymmetry breaking terms lead to the existence of @xmath0-balls with non - vanishing baryon or lepton number or electric charge .",
    "these supersymmetric @xmath0-balls have been considered recently as possible candidates for baryonic dark matter @xcite and their astrophysical implications have been discussed @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric @xmath0-balls have been constructed numerically in @xcite .",
    "the complex scalar field of boson stars and @xmath0-balls has a harmonic time - dependence with frequency @xmath1 . in 4-dimensional flat spacetime",
    ", the allowed frequency range for @xmath0-balls @xmath2 is solely determined by the properties of the potential describing the self - interaction @xcite .",
    "this frequency range holds for both non - rotating and rotating @xmath0-balls @xcite . for",
    "4-dimensional boson stars the maximal frequency @xmath3 remains the same as in flat spacetime , whereas the minimal frequency depends on the strength of the gravitational coupling constant and increases with increasing gravitational coupling .    for @xmath0-balls in 4 dimensions ,",
    "the mass and charge diverge at both ends of the frequency interval and assume their minimal value at a critical frequency @xmath4 , where the classical stability of the solutions changes @xcite . for @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. , below the critical value , the solutions are classically stable . as long as their mass is smaller than the mass of @xmath0 free bosons they are also quantum mechanically stable @xcite . in constrast , above @xmath4 the solutions are unstable .    the coupling to gravity modifies and enriches this simple pattern .",
    "thus when @xmath6 , the mass and charge of boson stars tend to zero , when the spacetime is 4-dimensional . moreover , in the lower frequency range , the boson star solutions are not uniquely determined by their frequency .",
    "instead a spiral - like frequency dependence of the charge and the mass is observed , where the charge and mass approach finite limiting values at the center of the spiral .",
    "thus a plethora of boson star branches appears , typically featuring a single classically stable branch @xcite .",
    "remarkably , for charged boson fields with a @xmath7-shaped scalar potential , also boson shells can arise @xcite .",
    "these may harbour black holes , violating black hole uniqueness @xcite .",
    "the presence of rotation leads to an interesting feature of these solutions , namely their angular momentum is quantized and corresponds to an integer @xmath8 times the charge , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "rotating @xmath0-balls and boson stars with @xmath10 thus have the smallest angular momentum @xmath11 for a given charge @xmath0 .",
    "while non - rotating @xmath0-balls and boson stars are cohomogeneity-1 , the presence of rotation includes an angular dependence and thus leads to a cohomogeneity-2 problem in 4 dimensions .    with the advent of string",
    "theory the exploration of higher dimensions has yielded many new insights for localized objects and their properties . for black holes , in particular , it became clear , that many features of black holes in 4 dimensions do not extend to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "it therefore appears eligible , to consider also other localized objects in higher dimensions , such as boson stars , which still represent alternatives to black holes @xcite . a first effort in this direction",
    "was undertaken by astefanesei and radu @xcite , who addressed non - rotating boson stars with a negative cosmological constant in 5 dimensions , and by prikas @xcite who studied electrically charged non - rotating boson stars in various dimensions in asymptotically flat as well as anti de - sitter spacetime .",
    "here we consider rotating asymptotically flat boson stars and their flat spacetime counterparts .",
    "in general , rotating objects in @xmath12 dimensions possess @xmath13 $ ] independent angular momenta @xcite . thus in 5 dimensions , there are two independent angular momenta associated with the two orthogonal planes of rotation .",
    "generic rotating solutions in 5 dimensions then depend on two coordinates , just as in 4 dimensions .",
    "however , when both angular momenta are chosen equal , @xmath14 , the symmetry of the solutions may be enhanced . for black holes",
    "one then obtains a cohomogeneity-1 problem , with dependence only on the radial coordinate , also in the presence of abelian gauge fields and dilaton fields @xcite .",
    "here we show , that with an appropriate ansatz for the scalar fields , the problem can be reduced to cohomogeneity-1 also for rotating @xmath0-balls and boson stars in 5 dimensions , when both angular momenta are chosen equal . for that purpose",
    "we introduce a complex doublet of scalar fields as present , for instance , in the electroweak sector of the standard model .",
    "moreover , we show that the quantization of the angular momentum also carries over , yielding for the lowest such rotating solutions the relation @xmath15 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the action , the ansatz and the expressions for the physical properties of the rotating @xmath0-balls and boson stars in 5 dimensions . in section 3",
    "we exhibit the numerical results for the solutions in flat spacetime , comparing non - rotating and rotating @xmath0-ball solutions , and discussing their stability .",
    "the effects of the coupling to gravity is the topic of section 4 , where we present the non - rotating and rotating boson star solutions .",
    "we give our conclusions in section 5 .",

    "however , the volume integral of the mass and charge in 4 dimensions contains a power of @xmath42 less than the volume integral in 5 dimensions .",

    "turning finally to large values of the gravitational coupling , we observe , that the classically stable branch has disappeared completely , since mass and charge no longer exhibit a minimum outside the spiral .",
    "moreover , all boson star solutions now have masses above the mass of @xmath0 free bosons .",

    "for boson stars , the same is true for the smaller values of the frequency , where charge and mass exhibit a spiral - like frequency dependence . in particular , both in 4 and 5 dimensions",
    "the effect of rotation is to considerably elongate the spirals for not too small gravitational coupling .",
    "however , when the maximal frequency @xmath3 is approached , which corresponds to the mass of the bosons , boson stars show a qualitatively different limiting behaviour .    in 4 dimensions",
    "both mass and charge tend to zero for boson stars as @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , in 5 dimensions both mass and charge of boson stars tend to finite values in this limit . employing scaled functions and a scaled radial coordinate",
    "we have analyzed this limit explicitly , by constructing the limiting solutions .",
    "the different behaviour can then be traced back to the different powers of the radial coordinate in the volume element in 4 and 5 dimensions .",
    "one may anticipate , that in dimensions greater than 5 the further powers of the radial coordinate in the volume element lead to a divergent behaviour of the mass and charge .",
    "indeed , we have verified for non - rotating boson stars in 6 dimensions , that @xmath104 and @xmath142 have the same scaling behaviour and thus the mass and charge diverge as @xmath6 .",
    "the classical stability of @xmath0-balls and boson stars can be analyzed according to catastrophe theory @xcite , implying a change of classical stability at each cusp encountered , when the mass is considered as a function of the charge .",
    "while the stability of @xmath0-balls does not change when going from 4 to 5 dimensions , the stability of boson stars must be reconsidered , because the cusp structure changes close to @xmath3 .",
    "thus whereas in 4 dimensions there is always a classically stable branch , with possible astrophysical relevance , the boson star solutions in 5 dimensions may not possess any classically stable branch , when the gravitational coupling becomes large .",
    "while we have focussed on the fundamental branches of boson stars , we have also obtained excited ( unstable ) branches , where the scalar field function has up to 6 nodes .",
    "a systematic study of these excited branches is still missing , however .",
    "another point of interest in the 4-dimensional case is the possible occurrence of an ergoregion , since this would imply an instability , associated with superradiance @xcite .",
    "our previous analysis in 4 dimensions showed that ergoregions can be present for boson stars on the classically stable branch .",
    "for boson stars in 5 dimension we observe also ergoregions in some parameter ranges .",
    "note that in the case of two equal angular momenta the ergoregion forms a shell .",
    "it is straightforward to extend the present calculations to non - rotating @xmath0-balls and boson stars in more than 5 dimensions . for the rotating boson stars",
    ", however , one needs to restrict to odd dimensions and choose all angular momenta equal , in order to keep the problem cohomogeneity-1 .",
