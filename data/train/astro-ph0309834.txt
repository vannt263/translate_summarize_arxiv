    "inflation , the stage of accelerated expansion of the universe , first proposed in the begin of 1980th  ( @xcite ) , nowadays attempts a great attention as well . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we investigated the generality of inflation for a wide class of quintessence potentials and noted that criteria we used is weak to decide about the inflationarity of the model with given potential .",
    "so in this paper we are proceeding with the investigation of closed friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models , but using power - law potentials only . in this way",
    "we calculate spectral indices , slow - roll parameters and other values on the epoch , when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon and at the end of inflation , to compare our constraints with early obtained results and with observation data .",
    "this allows us to make some constraints on frw models with scalar field , on potentials of the scalar field and on parameters of these potentials . since due to inflation universe becomes flat",
    "very quickly our constraints are applicable to flat case as well . if one supposes that the same potential describes both the inflation stage in early universe and acceleration nowadays we can compare our constraints with constraints on the quintessence potentials ( see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite for review of the problem ) .",
    "another aim of this paper is the investigation of the influence of the initial conditions on inflation dynamics in case of closed frw models",
    ". really , in case of initially flat universe we have only one degree of freedom   how does primordial energy density distribute between kinetic and potential terms , but in case of initially closed universe we have at least one more degree of freedom   the distribution between curvature and initial expansion rate terms .",
    "so our second aim is in studying these two distributions , comparison them to each other and investigation how does they act on inflation .",
    "the equations describing the evolution of the universe in closed frw model are @xmath1 @xmath2 and the first integral of the system is @xmath3    where @xmath4 .    and we use the _ trigonometrical ( angular ) _ parameterization @xmath5 of the space of initial conditions : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9.\\ ] ]    our method is as follows . like in  @xcite",
    "we start from the planck boundary for a given pair of initial conditions @xmath10 and then numerically calculate the further evolution of the universe through inflation .",
    "also we calculate scalar spectral index and slow - roll parameters during the evolution of the universe . and",
    "since the universe becomes flat very quickly due to the inflation , we can use the usual determination for scalar spectral index .",
    "there are two expressions for it   first order   and second order   ones and we use second order results for more precise calculations .",
    "also one can express them using _ potential slow - roll approximation _",
    "( psra )   and _ hubble slow - roll approximation _ ( hsra )  @xcite ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "equations for slow - roll parameters are :    for psra @xmath11 @xmath12 for hsra @xmath13 @xmath14    and for @xmath15 respectively :    @xmath16    @xmath17    where @xmath18 with euler - mascheroni constant @xmath19 .",
    "so we calculate @xmath15 by both these cases and compare them to each other . also we calculate slow - roll parameters and compare them at the epoch when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon for different potentials and for different parameters of the potentials .    since the purpose of our paper is to set constraints on inflation models , we compare results of our numerical calculations with constraints on @xmath15 and other values from experiments .",
    "in particular we compare them with results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we need to introduce horizon - flow parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( see  @xcite for more details ) : @xmath22 @xmath23 . \\eqno(5)\\ ] ]    to compare our constraints with  @xcite we need to localize the moment during inflation when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon .",
    "it took place at about 60 e - folds before the end of inflation  ( @xcite , see also   for details ) .",
    "this value is model - dependent and it depends also on the way of inflation ends so to simplify we use two values for this   62 as a bound value and 50 .",
    "and so we calculate all parameters on these two epochs   62 and 50 e - folds before the end of inflation . for further using",
    "we denote this value as @xmath24 .",
    "first , let us describe the dependence of the number of e - foldings universe experienced during inflation on initial conditions . to illustrate this we plotted in fig .  1 this dependence on @xmath25 and on @xmath26 separately ; to realize the whole picture one needs to multiply these functions .",
    "so in fig .",
    "1(a ) there is a dependence of the number of e - foldings universe experienced during inflation on @xmath25 for negative @xmath25 , in fig .",
    "1(b ) the same but for positive @xmath25 and in fig .  1(c )   on @xmath27 . from fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) one can also see the influence of sign of initial @xmath28   positive @xmath25 corresponds to positive initial @xmath28 and negative @xmath25 corresponds to negative initial @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath29}$ ]   the flat case   measure of trajectories experienced insufficient inflation ( the case when universe experienced inflation but the number of e - foldings is less then 70 ) is about @xmath30 for negative @xmath25 and about @xmath31 for positive @xmath25 ( so for flat case the universe experienced sufficient inflation for @xmath32 ; in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) dashed line corresponds namely to @xmath33 e - foldings ) .    from fig .  1",
    "one can also learn that the dependence of the number of e - foldings on @xmath27 is many times weaker than the dependence on @xmath25 .",
    "really , @xmath25 determines initial distribution of the energy between kinetic and potential terms and , since the universe very quickly reaches the slow - roll regime , it determines the energy density at the beginning of inflation . also during",
    "the reaching slow - roll regime @xmath26 becomes large , so @xmath27   initial value of @xmath26 weakly acts on the energy density at the beginning of inflation .",
    "power - law potentials are well studied and they lead to `` chaotic inflation ''  @xcite .",
    "one can really use them as inflation part in potentials like those considered by peebles and vilenkin  @xcite .",
    "they have also attracted attention for some of their properties  @xcite .",
    "we consider power - law potentials of a kind @xmath34    and our results are as follows . in fig .  2 we plotted positions of the models with different powers on ( @xmath35 ) plane in case of @xmath36 at ( a ) panel and in case of @xmath37 at ( b ) panel .",
    "by comparison these plots with bounds on ( @xmath35 ) plane obtained in  @xcite from 2df and wmap data one can make a constraint on @xmath38 as @xmath39 in case of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in case of @xmath42 .    another constraint on power @xmath38 one can obtain from fig .  3 . in fig .",
    "3 we plotted the dependence of @xmath15 : calculated in psra ( see eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) we denoted as @xmath43}n_s$ ] and calculated in hsra ( see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) we denoted as @xmath44}n_s$ ] .",
    "using bounds on @xmath15  @xcite : @xmath45 ( wmap only ) and @xmath46 ( wmap+acbar+cbi+2dfgrs+@xmath47-forest ) one can set a bound @xmath48 in case of @xmath40 and @xmath49 in case of @xmath42 .",
    "one can see these two constraints   from @xmath15 and previous one   are close to each other .",
    "now let us set a constraint on @xmath50 .",
    "to do this we can use results obtained from cobe data in  @xcite : @xmath51    and we calculate these values at the end of inflation . after defining @xmath52",
    "one can obtain @xmath53 and after substitution ( 6 ) to ( 7 ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56    one needs to keep in mind the relation between @xmath57 and @xmath50 to recalculate @xmath50 into @xmath57 and inversely : @xmath58    another test , also linked with cobe normalization  @xcite , is about density perturbation spectrum @xmath59 : @xmath60    and this value is calculated on the epoch when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon .",
    "also we can define value of the field on this epoch as @xmath61 and so rewrite ( 8) using ( 6 ) as @xmath62 let us remind the reader that according to cobe data this value is about @xmath63 .",
    "using it one can get another estimation for @xmath50 : @xmath64    = 7.5 cm    = 12.6 cm    finally , in fig .",
    "5 we plotted the dependence of both @xmath65 and @xmath66 on @xmath38 and the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath38 .",
    "the range of possible values of @xmath50 due to eq .",
    "( 7)(@xcite ) is between curves @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ". we plotted @xmath67 for cases @xmath40 and @xmath42 .",
    "one can see from fig .  5 that in case of @xmath68 we have a constraint @xmath41 and in case of @xmath42 we have a constraint @xmath69 .",
    "so we reached our aim   we set some constraints on power - law potentials and their parameters .",
    "we calculated the whole evolution of the universe during inflation for a wide range of initial conditions , parameters of power - law potentials ( power @xmath38 and @xmath57 ) and set some constraints on power - law potentials and on their parameters .",
    "also we compared our constraints with results obtained from the recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data and large scale structure ( lss ) data  . as we noted above for an epoch when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon we have used two values   62 e - folds before inflation ends and 50 e - folds . and 62 e - folds is bound value in the sense that other possible values are smaller then 62 .",
    "we used 50 e - folds namely as an example of such a value and to demonstrate what can happen with @xmath15 , @xmath20 and other values if we use lower ( then 62 ) number of e - folds before the end of inflation to determine the epoch when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon . and",
    "the result we obtained is : @xmath0 .",
    "the exact value is very model dependent .",
    "it depends on many factors , first on the way of inflation ends   this determines the epoch when the present hubble scale leaves the horizon . from figures",
    "one can see how does it act on the results .",
    "also it depends on the observation data   to make our constraints more precise we need more precise observation data . but even with these uncertainties our constraints are some harder then results obtained from the cmb and lss data  .    one can see that our numerical results are some differ from analytical results .",
    "this is due to the fact that one can incorrectly determine exact moment when inflation ends using relation @xmath70 . as one can see from fig .  4",
    "( we plotted it only as an example ; it corresponds to the case @xmath71 ) at _ real _ moment of the end of inflation only @xmath72 is exact equal to unity . and",
    "since most analytical results are obtained using relation @xmath73 , it corresponds not to the exact moment of the end of inflation . and",
    "the small difference between our numerical results and analytical results is namely due to this uncertainty .",
    "this work was supported by the russian ministry of industry , science and technology through the leading scientific school grant @xmath74 2338.2003.2 .",
