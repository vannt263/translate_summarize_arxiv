    "the very earliest ones that used proton decay in grand unified theories for this purpose run into difficulty on several counts : first is that successful inflation scenarios generally have reheating temperatures which are below the generic baryogenesis temperatures , especially in the context of supersymmetry , so that any gut generated baryon number is erased by inflation ; secondly , if baryogenesis is caused by @xmath2 conserving interactions as in @xmath3 models , they will be destroyed by electroweak sphalerons that are in equilibrium down to about 100 gev .    in the mid 80 s",
    ", a new mechanism was suggested that uses baryogenesis via leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is very attractive since it arises within the framework of the seesaw mechanism  @xcite that explains small neutrino masses . here",
    "the initial lepton asymmetry is created far below the gut scale and is then converted by the electroweak sphalerons  @xcite to a baryon asymmetry .",
    "this mechanism depends crucially on the properties of the electroweak sphaleron  @xcite which serves as the source of @xmath4 violation . while this is one of the most widely discussed schemes in literature today  @xcite",
    ", it may also have problems since adequate leptogenesis in these models implies a lower bound on the leptogenesis scale  @xcite which is above the allowed reheating scale in supersymmetric models  @xcite .",
    "it is also not so easy to test by low energy experiments .",
    "it is therefore important to explore alternative mechanisms that can explain the matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry from particle decays around 100 gev temperatures which do not conflict with the above bounds on reheat temperatures and at the same time yield testable consequences at lhc and other low energy experiments .",
    "such a mechanism was proposed in two recent papers  @xcite , where it was shown that with the use of higher dimensional baryon violating operators , baryogenesis can occur after the electro - weak sphalerons have gone out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this mechanism was called post - sphaleron baryogenesis ( psb ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a theory for this mechanism within a quark - lepton unified gauge model for neutrino masses based on the gauge group @xmath5  @xcite using the symmetry breaking setup discussed in ref .",
    "we show that in this model , quark - lepton unification allows us to relate the baryon asymmetry directly to neutrino masses via the type ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the main result of our work is that successful baryogenesis can occur only for an inverted mass hierarchy for neutrinos with a relatively large @xmath6 .",
    "both of these predictions will be tested in ongoing experiments searching for neutrino - less double beta decay and neutrino oscillations .",
    "the salient feature of psb mechanism is that baryogenesis occurs via the direct decay of a scalar boson @xmath7 having a weak scale mass and a higher dimensional baryon violating coupling .",
    "@xmath7 is the real part of a baryon number carrying complex scalar @xmath8 , which acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . in the context of the @xmath5 model",
    ", @xmath7 is the real part of a higgs scalar field belonging to @xmath9 representation of whose vev breaks the @xmath10 symmetry down to the @xmath11 of the standard model .",
    "the decays @xmath12 and @xmath13 provide the source for @xmath4 asymmetry .",
    "when the @xmath8-field has a vev , the decay process generates an interaction that causes neutron - antineutron oscillation as shown in ref .",
    "the parameter domain of our theory where adequate baryogenesis occurs predicts that neutron - antineutron oscillation should occur at a rate observable in currently available reactor facilities .",

    ", we see that when the scalar field @xmath8 , which has @xmath16 is given a vev , it leads to cubic scalar field couplings of the type @xmath17 and @xmath18 leading to baryon number violation by two units .",
    "we note that not all of the @xmath19 fields are needed for @xmath4 violation and @xmath20 oscillation : either @xmath21 or @xmath22 pair will do .",
    "in fact , consistency with flavor changing neutral current constraints and @xmath1 oscillation limits allow for only two of these three scalar states to be light near the tev scale . the third state ( in our case @xmath23 , as we will see below ) will have mass of order 100 tev .",
    "baryon asymmetry arises in this scheme from @xmath24-loop corrections to the @xmath7 decays and is therefore directly linked to ckm mixing @xcite .",
    "the constraints on the parameter space of the model arise from the fact that the decay of @xmath7 occurs below 100 gev and above 200 mev or so  the former to ensure that the sphalerons do not play any role in baryogenesis and the latter so that quarks in the cosmic soup have not combined to form hadrons , which will affect the decay estimates  and from the fact that the model must reproduce observed neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "if baryon asymmetry is created above the electroweak phase transition temperature , all of the baryon asymmetry will be washed out since there are both @xmath25 violating sphaleron interactions as well as @xmath26 mediated @xmath27 scatterings of right  handed majorana neutrinos in equilibrium at that temperature .    before discussing the constraints on the parameters of the model from low energy observations ,",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) is the @xmath37 whose vev breaks the gauge group of our model down to the sm gauge group  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the scale of this symmetry breaking is anywhere between 1  100 tev so that both the right  handed neutrinos as well as the gauge bosons belonging to @xmath38 have masses around these values .",
    "we note that while breaking the gauge symmetry only by the @xmath39 makes the @xmath26 mass scale , @xmath2 breaking scale @xmath40 , and the @xmath41 breaking scales all equal , and would also relate the @xmath42 mass with the @xmath43 mass .",
    "some of the constraints we derive below require that @xmath44 .",
    "this can be achieved by including a @xmath45 higgs field to break the symmetry , which will generate @xmath42 mass , but not @xmath43 mass and decouple @xmath42 mass from @xmath40 .",
    "our results will be valid in the presence of such @xmath45 higgs fields , or in their absence . in the latter case ,",
    "the common scale of @xmath2 symmetry breaking will be required to be @xmath46 tev or so .",
    "the higgs fields belonging to the @xmath47 multiplet will have the following mass pattern : @xmath48 will have mass near a tev , whereas @xmath23 will have mass near 100 tev .",
    "such a mass pattern is consistent , since as noted above , we could have the @xmath49 boson and the @xmath26 mass different from the @xmath43 mass and the right  handed neutrino mass scale .",
    "one important point to note is that due to @xmath41 gauge symmetry , all three couplings in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) become equal to each other i.e. , @xmath50 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) .    in general the neutrino mass in this model is given by a combination of type i and type ii seesaw contributions : @xmath51 the coupling matrix @xmath35 that appears in the neutrino mass formula above is related to the diquark couplings , which lead to fcnc effects , @xmath1 oscillations as well as the baryon asymmetry .",
    "they are therefore very highly constrained .    in what follows , we assume that @xmath52 or very small by an appropriate choice of the yukawa couplings of @xmath53 and @xmath54 fields ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) ) .",
    "the details of this are not relevant to the main point of our paper .",
    "since @xmath55 depends on the same parameters as the quark and charged lepton masses , it is useful to point out that setting @xmath56 does not lead to any conflict with realistic fermion mass and mixing patterns . to see this note that the two bi - doublet fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 are both complex scalars ; therefore each field will have two independent yukawa couplings with fermions : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 fermions , and @xmath62 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , it follows that the dirac mass matrices of the up quark , down quark , charged lepton , and the neutrino are all independent .",
    "once we set @xmath52 , we can directly link the neutrino mass matrix to the coupling matrix @xmath35 .",
    "the advantage of this is that the requirement of adequate baryogenesis as well as consistency with fcnc and other constraints fix not only the neutrino mass matrix , but also the mass spectrum of the theory .",
    "the fcnc constraints come from the fact that @xmath63 fields have masses in the multi - tev range and can lead to sizable @xmath64 and @xmath65 mixings .",
    "they in turn severely constrain the pattern of the yukawa couplings @xmath66 and thereby the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "in this section , we discuss the tree level flavor changing neutral current contributions to processes such as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 mixings from the di - quark higgs field exchanges .",
    "we have to make sure that they are not in conflict with observations .",
    "one can not make the di - quark scalar masses very large to satisfy the fcnc constraints , since successful post - sphaleron baryogenesis requires the masses of at least two of these scalars to be not more than about a tev .",
    "similarly , the doubly charged scalar bosons from the same multiplet will contribute to rare processes such as @xmath70 via tree level diagrams .",
    "neutrino oscillation data , on the other hand , suggest specific form of the @xmath35 matrix . we need to examine if these dual requirements can be simultaneously met .",
    "we have found that indeed this can be satisfied , but only for an inverted mass hierarchy spectrum for the neutrinos .    to discuss the constraints on the couplings @xmath66 and masses of @xmath71 implied by these considerations ,",
    "we first note that above the @xmath41 scale , all couplings to diquarks and dileptons are given by a single matrix @xmath66 .",
    "the form of this matrix can be specified in any basis without loss of generality and we specify them in the basis in which the down quarks are mass eigenstates . in this basis , the @xmath66 couplings split up into the following depending on which quarks they couple to : @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 indicates the coupling to @xmath75 , etc . assuming for simplicity that @xmath76 is not broken by the vacuum expectation values of the bidoublet fields ( so that the left  handed and right  handed ckm matrices are equal to each other ) , we get @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the quark rotation matrix and @xmath79 is the matrix that makes the charged leptons diagonal . clearly , it is @xmath80 which determines the neutrino mass matrix in the type ii seesaw case .    in this basis , first there are constraints from flavor changing processes such as @xmath67 , @xmath81 and @xmath69 mixings .",

    "the constraints from the various @xmath87 decay modes can then be easily satisfied for this limit on the @xmath85 mass and we do not give those constraints here .    another constraint on the parameters of the theory",

    "[ fig : tree ] ( see sec .",
    "5 ) and we find that @xmath93 we discuss this further in our model in sec .",
    "the nontrivial aspect of this model is that the same set of parameters responsible for baryogenesis is directly related to neutrino masses and mixings and must be such that they satisfy the strong fcnc constraints listed above .",
    "note that we can not suppress the fcnc effects by simply raising the masses of @xmath94 particles since in that case we can not satisfy the desired constraints for adequate baryogenesis .",
    "in this section , we address the question of how we satisfy these constraints and yet obtain concordance with neutrino oscillation observations .",
    "it turns out that if we choose @xmath74 matrix as ( in a basis where down quarks are mass eigenstates ) @xmath95 then for tev scale @xmath96 and @xmath97 and 100 tev mass for @xmath98 , we can satisfy all the hadronic constraints .",
    "such a choice will automatically satisfy @xmath67 and @xmath68 mixing constraints , owing to the zeros in the diagonal entries . in the leptonic sector ,",
    "as already noted , the most stringent constraint comes from @xmath83 and it requires that @xmath85 mass also be of order 100 tev or so .",
    "then we use the following unitary transformation to rotate @xmath74 to get the neutrino mass matrix : @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",

    "this value of @xmath6 is observable in the ongoing ( double chooz )  @xcite and planned ( daya bay )  @xcite experiments and should provide a test of the model .",
    "secondly we predict that the neutrinoless double @xmath109-decay experiments should observe a majorana neutrino mass at the 10 - 20 mev level which is perhaps within reach of the next round of neutrinoless double @xmath109-decay experiments . in fig .",

    "before proceeding to the discussion of how baryon asymmetry arises in this model , let us first sketch the cosmological sequence of events starting at the @xmath41 scale that leads up to this . for temperatures above the @xmath41 scale of about 100 tev , there is no @xmath2 violation .",
    "the sphalerons are active and therefore erase any pre - existing @xmath25 asymmetry in the universe .",

    "@xcite as well as from nuclear decay experiments  @xcite .",
    "our predicted value is accessible to current experiments under discussion at dusel as well as other facilities  @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) as noted in sec .",
    "2 , a crucial prediction of our quark - lepton unified model of post - sphaleron baryogenesis is that neutrinos must be majorana fermions and exhibit an inverted mass hierarchy form with large value for @xmath6 .",
    "this should be testable in long base line experiments as well as the ongoing and planned reactor experiments searching for @xmath6 and neutrinoless double beta decay searches  @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that there is indication of a non - zero @xmath6 from already existing neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) our theory is also testable in collider experiments such as the lhc since we have colored diquark scalar fields with masses in the tev range .",
    "it is clear from the form of the @xmath213 matrix that in a @xmath214 collision , the valence quarks in the two protons could produce the @xmath215 field which could then decay to @xmath216 jets .",
    "this could either be an @xmath217-channel single production  @xcite or drell - yan pair production  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath217-channel process will have a resonant enhancement which can give a signal above the standard model background .",
    "the drell - yan pair production could give signals of type @xmath218 missing @xmath219 .",
    "unlike the @xmath217-channel process , the drell - yan pair production has the advantage of not being dependent on the specific flavor texture of the two quark couplings @xmath35 and is promising for color sextet masses upto a tev  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be important to search for these particles at lhc . their discovery will signal a completely different direction for unification beyond the standard model than the conventional susy  gut theories .",
    "\\(iii ) in our model , since there is a mass hierarchy between the @xmath169 and @xmath98 masses i.e. @xmath220 , a one loop level box graph induced by the trilinear coupling @xmath221 will induce a quartic coupling @xmath222 coupling with a strength @xmath223 .",
    "this can lead to color breaking unless @xmath224 .",
    "this can be satisfied by lowering the @xmath40 scale to about 50 tev with @xmath225 . in order to reconcile this lower value with constraints from @xmath83",
    ", we can introduce a multiplet of type @xmath45 with a vev in the 100 tev range which gives mass to the @xmath26 and the @xmath85 .",
    "this vev decouples the @xmath2 breaking scale @xmath40 from the masses of the @xmath26 and @xmath85 fields . in this case",
    ", one can keep the @xmath2 breaking scale near 50 tev while keeping the @xmath26 and @xmath85 mass around 100 tev as required by the @xmath83 and @xmath226 constraints .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , note that a priori in the model there could be a coupling of type @xmath227 $ ] , which will induce a @xmath7 decay to two sm higgs fields .",
    "we assume that this parameter is very small .",
    "this assumption could be justified in supersymmetric extensions of the model where such terms are forbidden by holomorphy of the superpotential .",
    "in summary , we have pointed out that the post - sphaleron baryogenesis mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be naturally embedded into a 100 tev scale quark - lepton unified @xmath0 model .",
    "if we further assume that the neutrino masses in this model arise via the type ii seesaw mechanism , then the couplings responsible for baryogenesis and neutrino masses get intimately linked to one another . in this case",
    "adequate baryogenesis predicts that neutrino mass ordering must be inverted with large @xmath6 , a prediction that can be tested in ongoing neutrino experiments .",
