    "barrier option pricing is sensitive to parameters of stochastic volatility models mostly through what the model implies about the covariance between the asset spot price and the implied volatility skew ( see appendix [ bardepcorr ] for an elaboration of this intuition ) . in most markets",
    "there is indeed significant positive realized correlation between spot and volatility skew , and this dynamic can materially impact fair prices for barrier options .    in foreign exchange markets , where barrier options are a liquid  vanilla exotic \" product , this is generally implemented with some flavor of local volatility / stochastic volatility ( lvsv ) mixture model ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a typical formulation is :    @xmath0    here , @xmath1 is the asset spot price and @xmath2 represents a stochastic factor on the instantaneous variance that follows a mean - reverting square root process .",
    "@xmath3 is the normal risk - neutral drift of spot , equal to the discount rate @xmath4 minus the asset discount rate @xmath5 .    in this lvsv model the local volatility term @xmath6",
    "is calibrated to to implied volatilities and  fills in \" whatever match to implied volatilities is not handled by the pure stochastic volatility piece .",
    "this construction means that the volatility of volatility parameter @xmath7 effectively controls the mixture between local and stochastic volatility , and therefore the amount that implied volatility skew moves when the asset spot price moves . in the limit where @xmath7 goes to zero , lvsv is a pure local volatility model , where the model s implied volatility skew moves maximally as the spot price moves . in the limit where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are set such that , with constant @xmath9 , the model most closely matches the market implied volatilities , lvsv s implied volatility skew moves the least as spot moves .    therefore , in lvsv , the @xmath7 parameter controls the model - implied covariance between spot and implied volatility skew .",
    "however , it suffers from the same key problem as a pure local volatilty model : the contribution to forward skew and smile from the local volatility piece tend to zero as time progresses , which generally causes the model to misrepresent the real future market state .",
    "another approach is one by carr@xcite , where skew is modeled by jumps in spot and the frequencies of up- and down - jumps are dependent on the level of spot .",
    "this model has the benefit of quick vanilla pricing , which lets one calibrate the model quickly to market implied volatilities , an important feature of any model",
    ". it can give a stationary term structure of skew and smile , so can have more realistic forward volatilities than lvsv .",
    "however it often requires jumps in spot that are much larger than those actually experienced , which can misprice barrier option pricing if the probability of spot jumping through the barrier is significant .",
    "this paper develops a different approach to incorporating the covariance between spot and implied volatility skew .",
    "we start by recognizing that , in stochastic volatility models , implied volatility skew is closely related to ( and usually close to linear in ) the model correlation between spot and instantaneous volatility",
    ".    therefore we model this spot / volatility correlation as a separate stochastic asset , one that is correlated with spot .",
    "the correlation between spot and spot / volatility correlation , combined with volatility of spot / volatility correlation , is what determines the covariance between spot and implied volatility skew , and is the aspect of the model dynamics which most significantly impacts barrier option pricing .",
    "the end goal is a fast approximation for barrier option prices that is parameterized by only vanilla option prices and a small number of extra marked parameters that determine the term structure of the covariance between spot and implied volatility skew .",
    "this approximation will be motivated by and compared against pricing in a formal model .",
    "the full specification of the formal model that we use as a benchmark is :    @xmath10    where @xmath1 is the asset spot price , @xmath2 is the instantaneous variance ( volatility squared ) , and @xmath8 is the spot / volatility correlation , as per the heston@xcite stochastic volatility model .",
    "@xmath8 , however , is generalized to be stochastic and follows its own mean - reverting process .",
    "we name this benchmark model the stochastic volatility / stochastic correlation , or svsc , model .",
    "the nine svsc model parameters are :    @xmath11 : :    the mean reversion strength of instantaneous variance @xmath12 : :    the long - run average instantaneous variance @xmath13 : :    the initial value of instantaneous variance @xmath7 : :    the volatility of volatility @xmath14 : :    the mean reversion strength of spot / volatility correlation @xmath15 : :    the long - run average spot / volatility correlation @xmath16 : :    the initial value of spot / volatility correlation @xmath17 : :    the volatility of spot / volatility correlation @xmath18 : :    the correlation of fx spot and the spot / volatility correlation    note that the correlation between instantaneous variance and spot / volatility correlation is set to @xmath19 and is not a separate model parameter .",
    "this choice maximizes the determinant of the 3x3 correlation matrix and forces that matrix to be always positive definite .",
    "most derivative prices are only weakly dependent on this correlation , so we set it for maximal convenience .",
    "figure [ figvols ] shows an example implied volatility vs strike chart for parameters representative of a g10 foreign exchange market .",
    "a priori svsc parameters were @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath7 , and @xmath15 are calibrated to the market implied volatilities at the 25-delta and at - the - money strikes , and @xmath13 and @xmath16 are assumed to equal their long - run average values .",
    "also displayed in the same figure are the implied volatilities for the heston@xcite model - assuming that @xmath24 but otherwise using the calibrated svsc parameters .",
    "the implied volatilities we calibrate to are 10.1% for strike 0.9554 ; 9.0% for strike 1.0000 ; and 8.6% for strike 1.0438 ( the forward is equal to 1 in this example ) .",
    "the calibrated parameters are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .    , @xmath28 , and @xmath7 to three market implied volatilities .",
    "heston model implied volatilities are also displayed - note that svsc has larger volatility smile than heston because of the extra contribution from stochastic spot / volatility correlation . ]    unlike lvsv , svsc has approximately stationary forward skew and smile , and unlike carr@xcite s model , svsc has no jumps in spot .",
    "exotic derivative pricing generally involves taking market prices for forwards and implied volatilities as inputs ; calibrating a formal model to the market data ; and then using that calibrated model to price exotics consistently with prices of the vanilla hedges .",
    "a model like the benchmark svsc model above , with three stochastic factors , requires a monte carlo or backward induction numerical scheme to price even vanilla options .",
    "these numerical schemes are generally quite slow , especially when calibrating model parameters to market implied volatilities .",
    "we develop an approximation for barrier option pricing that starts with a semi - static replication for the barriers : a replication that is a good static vega hedge for the barrier , but only as long as the barrier is not touched .",
    "if the barrier is touched the replication hedge needs to be ",
    "unwound \" : that is , closed out at then - current market prices .",
    "the approximation involves deciding on the replicating portfolio for a given barrier option and then estimating the expected cost of unwinding the replication hedge if the barrier is touched .",
    "we calculate the replication cost , unwind premium , and barrier price in the heston model ( with an adjusted correlation parameter in unwind to incorporate the svsc effects ) , then divide the barrier price by the heston - model price of the underlying vanilla option to get the no touch probability in a measure associated with the underlying vanilla . the final approximation price of the barrier option equals the market price ( not the heston - model price ) of the vanilla option multiplied by that no touch probability .",
    "this final step is performed to ensure that the approximation does not suffer from inaccuracies due to slight differences in implied volatility interpolation between models .",
    "one key advantage of this approach is that no complex model calibrations to market implied volatilities are required .",
    "the approximation will require a calibration of a heston model to market implied volatilities at the barrier option expiration date , but heston has a semi - closed form for vanilla pricing and that calibration is very fast .    in the following",
    "we will assume barrier options are knockout options .",
    "knockin options of course can be priced using in - out parity , where a knockout plus the equivalent knockin equals the underlying vanilla option .      normally when calculating the expected cost of unwinding the replication hedge we would need to integrate over the three - dimensional probability distribution of first touching the barrier at time t conditioned on instantaneous volatility @xmath2 and spot / volatility correlation @xmath8 when the barrier is touched .",
    "our replication approach is chosen to simplify this calculation dramatically .",
    "first we choose a replication that is a good global vega hedge so long as the barrier is not touched , which collapses the integration in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "second , we choose a replication whose price is roughly linear in @xmath8 when spot is at the barrier , which means that we can collapse the integration in the @xmath8 direction and simply replace it by its expected value conditioned on hitting the barrier .",
    "we care that the replication is a good vega hedge because that means the price of the replication portfolio is only weakly sensitive on the level of instantaneous variance if spot touches the barrier . in that case",
    "the unwind cost mostly depends on the level of spot / volatility correlation at unwind , and therefore on what the model implies for covariance between spot and spot / volatility correlation , or in market terms , the implied volatility skew at that point .",
    "in addition the price of the replication portfolios we choose will be roughly linear in the spot / volatility correlation at unwind , so pricing depends only on the expected value of that correlation , not on the rest of its distribution .",
    "that fact lets us use the heston@xcite model as a proxy for svsc when calculating expected unwind prices , but using a time - dependent but deterministic spot / volatility correlation .",
    "the heston formulation allows for ( almost ) closed form pricing only with constant spot / volatility correlation ; to allow us to use the standard result we next develop an approximation for an  effective \" constant spot / volatility correlation that can be plugged into the standard heston result that replicates the value in the generalized heston model with a time - dependent determinist correlation of the form    @xmath29    which is of course the expected value of @xmath30 in the formal model from equation [ eqsdes ]",
    ".    in foreign exchange markets implied volatility skew is parameterized through the  risk reversal \" , normally defined as the difference in implied volatility between a call option with black - scholes delta equal to 0.25 and a put option with a black - scholes delta of -0.25 .",
    "consider an option position that is closely related to the risk reversal implied volatility difference defined above : a `` risk reversal position '' is an option portfolio that is long the 25-delta call option and short the 25-delta put option .",
    "this portfolio has a price which is close to linear in the risk reversal implied volatility difference .",
    "the expected vanna at time @xmath31 of a risk reversal position initiated at time 0 , @xmath32 , is approximately proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial time to expiration and @xmath9 is the constant black - scholes volatility ( see appendix [ secvds ] ) .",
    "this observation lets us estimate the price premium in the heston model of the risk reversal position expiring at time @xmath34 over its black - scholes value , @xmath35 , which is mostly due to cross gamma between spot and implied volatility :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the approximate expected vanna ( @xmath38 is a function of the initial delta of the risk reversal ) , @xmath39 is an assumed level of implied volatility ( roughly equal to instantaneous volatility @xmath9 , and assuming a flat term structure of atm volatility ) , @xmath40 is the standard deviation of the move in implied volatility over time @xmath41 , @xmath7 is the volatility of volatility parameter in the heston model , and @xmath11 is the mean reversion speed of volatility in the heston model .",
    "@xmath30 is the ( deterministic ) instantaneous spot / volatility correlation at time @xmath31 .",
    "note that this assumes zero contribution from `` volga '' ( second order exposure to volatility ) as a risk reversal position has close to zero volga at initiation and close to zero on average over its life .",
    "substituting @xmath30 from equation [ rhot ] , we find that the premium of the risk reversal position over black - scholes is approximately :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are functions of @xmath11 , @xmath14 , and time to expiration @xmath34 :    @xmath45    we want an approximate constant spot / volatility correlation @xmath46 which reproduces the same risk reversal premium as our time - dependent correlation term structure , so we equate the risk reversal premium with constant correlation @xmath46 with that in equation [ eqrrprem ] :    @xmath47      an  out - of - the - money barrier option \" is one where the underlying vanilla option is out of the money vs spot when the barrier is hit - for example , a down - and - out call .",
    "a good semi - static replication for an out - of - the - money barrier option involves two vanilla options : long one unit of the vanilla option underlying the barrier option ; and short a vanilla option with a strike  reflected \" through the barrier ( the  reflected strike \" @xmath48 ) .",
    "the short option is a put if the barrier option is a call , and a call if the barrier option is a put .",
    "the quantity of the short option in the replication is @xmath49 .",
    "this quantity is not simply 1 because of a constraint that if we flip the numeraire from the denominated currency to the asset and regenerate the replication , we should get the same replicating portfolio .",
    "this symmetry under switch of numeraire is important in the foreign exchange space where there is no preferred numeraire , but is good practice generally and improves the quality of the vega replication .",
    "the strike of the short option - the reflected strike @xmath48 - is set such that the initial price of the replication under the black - scholes model matches the initial price of the barrier option under black - scholes :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the black - scholes price of the reflected - strike vanilla option ( whose call / put type is opposite to that of the barrier option ) ; @xmath52 is the black - scholes price of the vanilla option with strike @xmath53 underlying the barrier option ; and @xmath54 is the black - scholes price of the barrier option with strike @xmath53 and barrier level @xmath55 . ",
    "black - scholes price \" here means black - scholes with constant volatility equal to the at - the - money volatility to the barrier option expiration date @xmath34 and constant risk neutral drift @xmath3 .",
    "this equation must be solved numerically but , since all the black - scholes prices have closed form , the root - finding is very fast .",
    "if the risk neutral drift @xmath56 , the reflected strike @xmath48 reduces to @xmath57 . for non - zero @xmath3",
    "it is similar to that value but approximately corrects for the fact that the forward will be different than the barrier level if spot hits the barrier at a time @xmath58 .",
    "this replication follows , for example , carr , ellis , and gupta@xcite , where the replication quantities are not functions of volatility .",
    "that means the replication ends up being a good semi - static vega hedge for the barrier option ( only semi - static , not static , because the hedge fails if spot touches the barrier ) .",
    "the effectiveness of the vega hedge is displayed in figure [ figbarvega5 ] , which shows the black - scholes vega of a down - and - out call option with strike 1 and barrier level 0.97 .",
    "the market corresponds to that in figure [ figvols ] , except with a risk neutral drift of -5% .",
    "even with a substantial risk neutral drift the vega hedge is a good semi - static vega hedge across different spots and times .",
    "the corresponding chart for zero risk neutral drift is not shown because the post - hedge vega is indistinguishable from zero .          in our approximation",
    "we assume the price of the barrier option @xmath59 is given as :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the price of the vanilla replication portfolio as seen at time @xmath31 and spot @xmath1 , and @xmath62 is the expected cost of unwinding it due to touching the barrier at different times before expiration @xmath34 :    @xmath63    here , @xmath64 is the denominated currency discount factor from time 0 to time @xmath31 , and @xmath65 is the probability of first touching the barrier in @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 is the expected value of the replication portfolio as seen at time @xmath31 conditioned on spot being at the barrier @xmath55 .",
    "we approximate that integral with a sum over @xmath68 equally - space time intervals :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the time to the start of the @xmath71^th^ interval ( @xmath72 ) , @xmath73 is the time to the middle of the @xmath71^th^ interval , and @xmath74 is the time to the end of the @xmath71^th^ interval ( @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ) .",
    "@xmath77 is the probability of first touch before time @xmath31 , equal to the price of a one touch expiring at time @xmath31 with no discounting .",
    "an important property of the replication portfolio is that , because it looks like a risk reversal position when spot is at the barrier , its price is relatively insensitive to the level of instantaneous volatility ; and because a risk reversal position s value is roughly linear in spot / volatility correlation , its price depends only on the expected value of spot / volatility correlation , not its variance .",
    "therefore we write :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 represents the price of the replication portfolio under the heston model , as seen at time @xmath31 .",
    "the heston model parameters are the mean reversion strength @xmath11 of instantaneous variance , the constant spot / volatility correlation @xmath80 , the volatility of volatility @xmath81 , the instantaneous variance @xmath82 , and the long term variance @xmath83",
    ".    we will estimate the appropriate heston - model parameters to use from a calibration of the heston model at @xmath84 to vanilla option prices expiring at time @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath11 is specified externally , and in the calibration we assume @xmath85 , so there are three parameters to calibrate at the start .",
    "for the instantaneous variance parameter @xmath82 we use the dupire@xcite volatility , and using heston - model option prices to time @xmath31 based on the initial calibration to vanilla options expiring at time @xmath34 .    the final parameter to estimate , and the most important , is the value for the heston spot / volatility correlation parameter @xmath80 .",
    "for this we will estimate the expected value of the instantaneous spot / vol correlation , conditioned on spot hitting the barrier at time @xmath31 , and use equation [ eqrhoa ] to get the effective constant heston correlation parameter @xmath80 .",
    "we need two additional approximations here : first , that the conditional expected correlation does not depend much on the level of volatility , so we can use an approximate constant volatility ; and second , that the stochastic term in the sde for spot / volatility correlation @xmath8 does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "that is , we simplify our system of sdes to :    @xmath86    where @xmath9 is some approximately constant volatility and @xmath87 , with @xmath88 some approximate constant correlation ( more on that at the end of this section ) .",
    "@xmath89 , the log of spot .",
    "now we replace @xmath90 with a @xmath91 , where @xmath92 has zero correlation with @xmath93 , and replace @xmath93 with its equivalent in terms of @xmath94 :    @xmath95    we want to condition on @xmath96 for some time @xmath31 in the future when spot first touches the barrier @xmath55 , so we replace the sde for @xmath97 with a brownian bridge process :    @xmath98    the expected value of @xmath99 following a brownian bridge process is just @xmath100 , and the expected value of @xmath101 is @xmath102 .",
    "we can then take the expected value of equation [ eqdrho ] to get    @xmath103    this ode solves to    @xmath104    the first two terms give the unconditional expected value of @xmath30 , and the third gives the correction from conditioning on the final value of spot .",
    "for our purpose , @xmath105 , where @xmath55 is the barrier level and @xmath106 is the initial level of spot . for convenience we also set @xmath107 , where @xmath80 is the correlation parameter from an initial heston calibration ( performed at @xmath84 ) to vanillas expiring at time @xmath34 .",
    "writing the initial forward to @xmath31 as @xmath108 , we get the final expression for conditional expected instantaneous spot / volatility correlation :    @xmath109    note that the dependence on the specific volatility choice @xmath9 is indeed somewhat weak : it appears only in the final term , and @xmath110 is order @xmath111 , much larger than @xmath112 in most cases . for @xmath113",
    "we use the value of @xmath114 from the calibration at @xmath84 to vanillas expiring at @xmath34 .",
    "earlier we left out what the best value is to use for @xmath88 in the definition of @xmath115 .",
    "an algorithm that works quite well is to make two passes : first use @xmath80 and get an initial estimate of @xmath116 from that ; then refine @xmath117 and get the final estimate of @xmath118 using that approximate average correlation over the move to the barrier .",
    "we use that second estimate of conditional expected instantaneous spot / volatility correlation to get the heston spot / volatility correlation parameter @xmath119 to use in the unwind calculation as :    @xmath120    with this we have all the parameters we need to calculate the expected conditional cost of unwinding the replication portfolio if the barrier is first touched at time @xmath31 . but to calculate the full expected unwind cost we also need to estimate @xmath77 , the probability of first touching the barrier by time @xmath31 .    the unwind value is not that sensitive to this probability ; instead the result depends mostly on the predictions for conditional spot / volatility correlation .",
    "so we do not need to be too accurate here .",
    "one approach is to use the black - scholes one touch pricing formula , but we can do somewhat better than that by again looking at an approximate one touch replication .    a reasonable replication for a one touch is a european digital with the same strike as the one touch , but twice the notional : when spot is at the barrier the one touch has value 1 and the european digital has a price of roughly 50% , as it has ( roughly ) even odds of ending in the money or out of the money . we will use a relatively crude approximation for the one touch price based on that replication :    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the black - scholes price of the one touch ; @xmath123 is the heston - model price of the european digital ; and @xmath124 is the black - scholes price of the european digital ( using the at - the - money implied volatility as the constant black - scholes volatility ) .",
    "all prices are divided by discount factors to turn them into probabilities .",
    "this lets us calculate the expected cost of unwinding the replication in equation [ eqotmunwind ] .",
    "barrier option prices in g10 foreign exchange markets have very tight bid / offer spreads , which means that model accuracy is very important .",
    "typical bid / offer spreads for out - of - the - money barriers are only slightly wider than those of vanilla options , usually on the order of a few basis points .",

    "spot is equal to 1 and risk neutral drift is zero , as is the discount rate .",
    "model and heston prices in the examples were calculated with monte carlo simulation using 1,000 time steps and 1,000,000 paths to get standard errors down to approximately 0.2bp . the unwind calculation used @xmath125 time buckets .",
    "the approximation does a very good job of matching the formal model price for out - of - the - money barrier options , in almost all cases landing within 1bp of the benchmark svsc model price .",
    "differences between the full model and heston prices for barrier options are usually a few basis points , and the accuracy of the approximation is better than that difference .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabitmbarsrf5 ]",
    "the pricing of barrier options in the approximation above depends on market implied volatilities and the model parameters ; but a limited set of model parameters .",
    "in addition the approximation does not require a calibration of model parameters to implied volatilities : instead it requires a heston model calibration which is much more efficient .",

    "would be expected to mark those three parameters , which gives them the ability to calibrate ( in an ad hoc way ) to market prices of barrier options they see in the market .",
    "however , those marks can also be motivated by an estimation from historical dynamics , and this section explains how to estimate these parameters historically .",

    "since the expected move in @xmath8 given a spot return in this model is    @xmath154    we can write the risk reversal @xmath11 , @xmath155 , in terms of @xmath153 as :    @xmath156    figure [ figrrbetahistory ] shows the historical 1 m and 1y risk reversal @xmath11 for eur / usd from july 2007 to july 2013 , using a one year rolling window for a regression of daily change in risk reversal against spot return .",
    "typical values range from 0.05 to 0.15 .",
    "the term structure of the risk reversal @xmath11 is determined by @xmath157 which is a function of the model parameters @xmath11 and @xmath14 , already determined in earlier sections .",
    "we will therefore use just one tenor s value of risk reversal @xmath11 to estimate @xmath153 . for a given tenor @xmath34 we use the level of the market risk reversal @xmath138 to determine the proportionality constant @xmath158 and then the measured risk reversal @xmath11 to calculate @xmath153 . in this analysis",

    "an important market dynamic for pricing barrier options is the covariance between spot and implied volatility skew , and the svsc model developed in this paper captures that dynamic through a stochastic spot / volatility correlation that is itself correlated with spot .",
    "we consider many variations of barrier options and one touches and show that the price impact of stochastic spot / volatility correlation is often comparable to or larger than the typical market bid / ask spreads for these products , and therefore is an important dynamic to consider - not surprisingly , as many market makers already use some flavor of lvsv model to approximately capture this effect . we discuss why the svsc model is a more natural way of capturing the covariance between moves in spot and moves in implied volatility skew .",
    "we also develop an approximation for barrier option pricing under the model that is both accurate and very fast , requiring only heston model vanilla pricing and calibration .",
    "the approximation is accurate to a tolerance that is within the market bid / ask spread for barrier options in markets where the risk neutral drift is modest : a few percent or less .",
    "a similar approximation for one touch prices was developed that is also accurate to a tolerance that is within the market bid / ask spread for one touches , again for markets where the risk neutral drift is modest .",
    "in addition to market vanilla option prices the approximation requires three marked model parameters : @xmath11 , the mean reversion strength of instantaneous variance ; @xmath14 , the mean reversion strength of instantaneous spot / volatility correlation ; and @xmath153 , a parameter that controls the covariance between moves in spot and moves in the spot / volatility correlation . those parameters can be marked to approximately calibrate pricing to market barrier options and one touches , or can be estimated historically .",
    "we demonstrate historical estimations of these three parameters .",
    "future work could include developing replications for barrier options and one touches that are better semi - static vega hedges in markets where risk neutral drift is significant .",
    "a key intuition about barrier option pricing is that their fair values depend mostly on what the model implies for covariance between spot and implied volatility skew , and not much on other aspects of the model .",
    "this is a good approximation for models where spot is diffusive - that is , does not allow for jumps in spot ( though jumps in volatility are allowed ) .",
    "this of course is not exact - it merely is an intuition pump to help modelers decide what aspects of the market dynamics to include in a model when pricing barrier options .",
    "consider barrier options which are out of the money when the barrier is hit : for example , a down - and - out call option .",
    "the boundary conditions that determine its value are the payout at expiration if the barrier was not hit ( a call option payoff ) and the value at the barrier level for times less than expiration ( zero ) .",
    "as described in section [ secotmbar ] these boundary conditions can be replicated fairly accurately with a simple vanilla option portfolio : long a call option with the same strike and expiration date as the barrier option ; and short a put option with the same expiration date as the barrier option , but a strike equal to the call option strike reflected through the barrier level .",
    "if spot does not touch the barrier by expiration , the call option replicates the barrier option terminal payout .",
    "if spot is touched at some time before expiration , the two - vanilla replication roughly has a price of zero , as the long call and the short put are roughly the same amount out of the money and offset .",
    "this is not an exact replication of course , even under black - scholes , especially when the risk - neutral drift is large .",
    "however , in practice the two - vanilla portfolio provides a good semi - static vega hedge for the barrier option - only semi - static because the hedge fails if the barrier is touched .",
    "if the barrier is touched then the vanilla portfolio needs to be unwound , which is where model implications for dynamic hedging costs matter . at that point",
    "the long call and short put are roughly the same distance out of the money , and look like a risk reversal position .",
    "a risk reversal position has very little vega , so its value on unwind does not depend ( much ) on the model s prediction for at - the - money volatility when spot moves to the barrier .",
    "it also has very little sensitivity to the level of the implied volatility smile .",
    "to a good approximation the risk reversal position s value is linear in the implied volatility skew .",
    "so the unwind cost - conditioned on hitting the barrier at some future time - depends on the model s prediction for the implied volatility skew at that point . and",
    "because the value of the risk reversal position is close to linear in implied volatility skew , only the expected value of the implied volatility skew , conditioned on hitting the barrier at that future time , is important - not the variance of that future implied volatility skew .",
    "the expected value of the implied volatility skew , conditioned on spot moving to the barrier , is going to be mostly defined by the covariance between spot and implied volatility skew .",
    "therefore , the expected cost of unwinding the two - vanilla hedge depends mostly on that covariance , and not on other features of the model .    a similar argument",
    "be made about an up - and - out put option , where the replication is a put option with the same strike @xmath53 as the barrier option , and a call option with strike @xmath162 .",
    "note that the assumption of no jumps in spot is particularly important for this explanation ; if spot jumps far enough through the barrier then the two - vanilla replication will not look like a risk reversal position at unwind .",
    "in section [ sechestoncorr ] we use the fact that , in the black - scholes model , the vanna of a risk reversal position is approximately proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath31 is the future date , @xmath34 is the expiration date of the vanilla option , and @xmath9 is the constant volatility .",
    "we derive that relationship here , and note that the approximation is valid when @xmath163 .        where @xmath165 is the vanna of the option , taken here for simplicity to be the derivative of the vega with respect to the forward ( rather than spot ) , and we assume zero discount rates to simplify the expressions ( that simplification has no material impact on the result ) .",
