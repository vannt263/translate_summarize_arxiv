    "the understanding of the @xmath0-process contribution to the isotopic abundances of heavy elements in the solar system is fundamental to disentangle between several nucleosynthesis processes that have competed during the evolution of the milky way .",
    "the @xmath0-process abundances observed in the solar system are the result of a complex galactic chemical evolution process , which mainly accounts for the pollution of several agb generations with different initial masses and metallicities .",
    "it was shown that agb stars with low initial masses ( @xmath4 = 1.5 and 3 @xmath5 ) , half solar metallicity , and a specific @xmath6c - pocket choice ( called case st ) reproduce the @xmath7 component of the @xmath0-process ( arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) , which synthesized about half of the elements from sr to pb .",
    "this approximation still provides strong information about the @xmath0-process contribution to isotopes in the region between @xmath8ba and @xmath9pb ( see discussion in bisterzo et al .",
    "+ two additional @xmath0-process components should be considered to reproduce the solar abundances of light neutron capture isotopes up to sr ( the @xmath10 component ) and the stable isotopes at the termination point of the @xmath0-path , @xmath11pb and @xmath12bi ( the @xmath13 component ) .",
    "the @xmath10 process occurs in massive stars during core he and shell c burning and partly produces neutron capture isotopes lighter than a @xmath14 90 ( @xmath15sr @xmath1410% ; lower contribution to y and zr isotopes ; see e.g. , pignatari et al .",
    "agb stars with low metallicity and low initial mass synthesize about half of solar @xmath11pb , the so called @xmath13 component ( see gallino et al .",
    "1998 ; travaglio et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath6c in the pocket is primary , which means it is directly synthesized in the star independently of the initial composition .",
    "therefore , by decreasing the metallicity , the number of free neutrons per iron seed becomes so large to overcome the first and the second @xmath0-peaks ( sr - y - zr and ba - la - ce , respectively ) , to feed directly @xmath11pb ( and @xmath12bi ) .    actually , the understanding of the origin of light @xmath0-process isotopes sr , y and zr is more enigmatic .",
    "gce models by travaglio et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that agb yields underestimate the solar abundance of sr , y , zr , and the solar composition of isotopes from @xmath16sr to @xmath17xe by about 2030% ( including the @xmath0-only @xmath18mo , @xmath19ru , @xmath20pd , @xmath21cd , @xmath22sn , @xmath23te and @xmath17xe ) .",
    "the @xmath10 process can not compensate the missing solar abundance , because it mainly produces isotopes up to sr , with a negligible contribution up to @xmath17xe .",
    "spectroscopic observations of peculiar metal - poor stars showing large enhancement in @xmath24-process elements neutron capture process is ascribed to explosive nucleosynthesis phases of massive stars . ]",
    "suggest that @xmath1410% of solar sr - y - zr is due to the @xmath24-process .",
    "however , both @xmath0- and @xmath24-processes are not sufficient to explain the solar observations of light neutron capture elements .",
    "travaglio et al .",
    "( 2004 ) hypothesized the existence of an additional process of unknown origin , called by the authors lepp ( light element primary process since it was supposed to be of primary origin ) .",
    "several scenarios have been recently explored , both involving the secondary @xmath0-process in massive stars ( e.g. , @xmath25-component by pignatari et al .",
    "2013 , which may explain the missing @xmath0-process component ) or primary @xmath24-process during the advanced phases of explosive nucleosynthesis ( see review thielemann et al . 2011 , which may account of complementary @xmath24-contributions ) . therefore , even if promising theoretical improvements related to the explosive phases of massive stars and core collapse supernovae , as well as recent spectroscopic investigations ( roederer et al . 2012 ; hansen et al .",
    "2012 ) have been made , a fully understanding about the origin of the neutron capture elements from sr up to xe is still lacking .",
    "we aim to investigate the effects of a new set of agb yields ( with updated nuclear cross section network and solar abundances ) on the solar @xmath0-process composition ( section  2 ) .",
    "we focus the analysis on the variations of the solar - system @xmath0-process gce predictions by adopting updated agb yields , and by testing the effects of different prescriptions on nuclear cross sections .",
    "the galactic evolution is computed as function of time up to the present epoch ( @xmath26 = 13.73 @xmath27 0.12 by wmap ) , following the three zones of the galaxy , halo , thick and thin disk .",
    "we adopted the yields by rauscher et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and travaglio et al .",
    "( 2004b ) for sne ii and ia , respectively .",
    "major revisions involve the solar system meteoritic abundances by lodders , palme and gail ( 2009 ) , a neutron capture cross section network with the most recent published measurements , as well as a larger set of agb yields that extend toward lower initial mass ( down to @xmath4 = 1.3 @xmath5 ) .",
    "we started from the agb models presented by bisterzo et al .",

    "a series of thousands of new agb models have been run , for a total of 28 metallicities from [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 down to @xmath283.6 ( most of them focused on the metallicity range between solar and [ fe / h ] = @xmath281.6 , where the isotopes of the three @xmath0-peaks are largely produced , see travaglio et al . 1999 , 2001 , 2004 ;",
    "serminato et al .",
    "yields of a set of five agb models with low initial masses ( @xmath4 = 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5 , 2 , and 3 @xmath5 ) and two agb models with intermediate initial masses ( @xmath4 = 5 and 7 @xmath5 ) have been interpolated / extrapolated over the whole metallicity and mass range ( hereafter lms refers to the mass range between 1.3 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 4 , and ims to 4 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 8) .",
    "this assures a sufficiently high accuracy in the agb mass and metallicity ranges .    particularly challenging for the @xmath0-process",
    "is the understanding of the formation of the @xmath6c - pocket , specifically the mass fraction of @xmath6c and @xmath32n in the pocket and the mass involved .",
    "both uncertainties largely affect the @xmath0-yields ( see e.g. , straniero et al .",
    "2006 ; herwig 2005 ) .",
    "current full evolutionary agb models still adopt a free parametrization to reproduce the @xmath6c - pocket , by means of overshooting ( e.g. , herwig 2000 , herwig et al .",
    "2011 ; karakas 2010 ) or other better physically justified prescriptions ( e.g. , new fruity models by cristallo et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 , and references therein ; or mixing produced by magnetic fields , busso et al .",
    "as suggested by the @xmath0-process spread observed at a given metallicity in different stellar populations ( e.g. , post - agb , ba , ch and cemp - s stars ; sneden et al .",
    "2008 ; kppeler et al 2011 ) , a range of the @xmath0-process efficiency strengths is needed .",
    "the theoretical reason of this spread observed among @xmath0-elements is still under investigation ( agb initial mass , magnetic fields , gravitational waves , or rotation , see piersanti , cristallo and straniero 2013 ) . + as discussed by bisterzo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we artificially introduce the @xmath6c - pocket in our post - process agb calculations , and we treated it as a free parameter kept constant pulse by pulse .",
    "starting from the @xmath6c - pocket st case , similar to that adopted by gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we multiply or divide the @xmath6c ( and @xmath32n ) abundances in the pocket by different factors .",
    "we considered an accurate weighted average of the @xmath6c - pocket efficiencies in order to reproduce @xmath14100% of solar @xmath33sm and the other @xmath0-only isotopes heavier than @xmath34 @xmath14 90 .",
    "note that @xmath33sm has well defined solar abundance , and it is the @xmath0-only isotope less affected by branchings and nuclear cross section uncertainties as well . a second reaction , the @xmath1ne(@xmath2 , n)@xmath3 mg , starts to partially burn at @xmath35 = 3 during thermal pulses and produces an efficient neutron burst mainly affecting isotopes close to the branching points .    results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the @xmath0-only isotopes are indicated by solid circles .",
    "different symbols have been used for isotopes that receive additional contributions : @xmath36xe , @xmath37gd , and @xmath38er ( open squares ) , which have a non - negligible p contribution ; @xmath39lu ( open triangle ) , a long - lived isotope ( 3.8 x 10@xmath40 yr ) , which decays into @xmath39hf ; @xmath41os ( open triangle ) , which is affected by the long - lived decay of @xmath41re ( 4.1 x 10@xmath40 yr ) ; @xmath42ta ( open circle ) , which also receives contributions from the p process and from @xmath43-nucleus interactions in massive stars ; @xmath11pb ( filled big square ) , half of which is produced by the strong-@xmath0 component .",
    "we compare the @xmath0-process predictions , calculated with the gce model at the epoch of the solar system formation ( @xmath44 = 9.17 gyr from the beginning of the birth of the universe ) , with the meteoritic abundances by lodders et al .",

    "the total @xmath0-percentages ( lms + ims ) is represented by blue symbols .",
    "ims agbs play a minor role in the galactic enrichment , because their he - intershell is smaller than in lms by one order of magnitude , with an uncertain formation of the @xmath6c - pocket and a less efficient third dredge - up .",
    "the @xmath1ne(@xmath2 , n)@xmath3 mg neutron source is efficiently activated in ims due to the high temperature reached at the bottom of the thermal pulses ( @xmath35 = 3.5 ) .",
    "the peak neutron density reached in ims easily allows a strong overproduction of @xmath16kr , @xmath47rb , and @xmath18zr , three neutron rich isotopes affected by the branchings at @xmath48kr and @xmath49zr , which are very sensitive to the neutron density .",
    "+ particularly large is the abundance of @xmath18zr ( big asterisk ) .",
    "note that @xmath18zr is strongly sensitive to the number of thermal pulses experienced by the agb models , as well as to the @xmath1ne(@xmath2 , n)@xmath3 mg rate adopted . in general , an over - prediction of @xmath18zr may suggest a low number of thermal pulses for ims . as discussed by bisterzo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we assume a strong mass loss for ims , which allows a total of 24 thermal pulses . under this hypothesis ,",
    "ims produce about 30% of solar @xmath18zr , while an additional 70% comes from lms ( figure 1 , @xmath45 @xmath46 ) .",
    "@xmath18zr is the most neutron rich stable zr isotope , and a contribution of 100% from agb is surely overestimated .",
