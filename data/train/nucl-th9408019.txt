    "flux tubes are one of the most elementary systems of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "they are the idealized configurations of heavy quark - antiquark pairs at large separation @xmath2 such that the region between can be assumed to possess axial - cylindrical symmetry .",
    "they play a central role in lattice qcd calculations and in models of qcd , as well as in the phenomenology of qcd processes , such as jets produced in heavy ion collisions or the  spaghetti \" connecting the separating heavy ions .    from the spectroscopy of heavy quarkonia and regge trajectories , it has been possible to extract a reliable measurement of the string tension by assuming the two body potential for heavy quarks to be of the form @xmath3 the  experimental \" value is@xcite @xmath4 mev / fm = 0.18 gev@xmath5=4.63/fm@xmath5 . in fact the linear region of the flux tube potential",
    "is not directly explored by quarkonia or by lattice qcd calculations :    the wave functions in quarkonia calculations tend to be centered near the  knee \" of the potential although high - lying states do explore more deeply into the linear region .",
    "however other forms of the heavy quark potential ( including a logarithmic term ) have also achieved some success in reproducing quarkonia spectra .",
    "lattice qcd calculations on flux tubes are generally limited to the quenched approximation ( no massless quarks ) and allow for a separation of the heavy quark - antiquark of only about 1 fm , which do not reproduce a cylindrical region    static flux tubes are unstable at separations greater than 1 fm , since the energy required to stretch the tube by 1 fm is nearly 1 gev , which is about the energy difference between a quarkonium , @xmath7 , and a pair of heavy - light mesons , @xmath8 .",
    "lattice calculations without light quarks can not explore this instability .",
    "recently there have been several papers   @xcite which have explored the creation of light quark - antiquark pairs as a mechanism for flux tube breaking .",
    "they employ a variation of the schwinger@xcite parallel plate capacitor model in which the infinite transverse geometry is replaced by the mit boundary condition @xmath9 at the cylindrical tube surface for the light quarks . the electric field @xmath10 is constant over all space in the longitudinal ( @xmath11 ) direction , with @xmath12 equal to @xmath10 inside the tube and zero outside .",
    "it is found that pair production in the cylinder is suppressed relative to the schwinger formula due to transverse confinement which gives the quarks an effective mass proportional to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radius of the flux tube .    in the present work ,",
    "we make some simplifying assumptions , the most significant are :    we consider infinite flux tubes .",
    "this means that the tube is long compared with its radius . for a jet , this means that the characteristic tube lifetime , @xmath15 , since the quark producing the jet travels near the speed of light .",
    "we use the mit bag model for the tubes .",
    "although some contact is made with color su(3 ) , we perform our calculations in u(1 ) . the extension to abelian su(3 )",
    "is not a serious complication .",
    "we adopt one dimensional debye screening for the quark - quark interactions used in the boltzmann collision term .",
    "this is further simplified to an effective @xmath16-function potential .    with these approximations ,",
    "our results depend on only one parameter , the initial ( static ) flux tube radius .",
    "we utilize the framework of the mit model because it is so very simple .",
    "it is the prototype of color dielectric models .",
    "some features of various models of flux tube are discussed in sec .",

    "the calculation of the flux tube configuration is straightforward since it involves no quarks .",
    "the flux through the tube is equal to the color charge @xmath17 , where the @xmath18 are the gell - mann color matrices .",

    "@xmath20 is the charge at one end ( say , the left ) of the flux tube ( @xmath21 at the other ) .",

    "we distinguish it from the charge @xmath22 of the light quarks being created in pairs , although for the static model @xmath23 .",
    "the energy per unit length is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , with @xmath14 the cylinder radius , and @xmath26 is the bag constant .",

    "the rate of pair creation in the schwinger mechanism with mit boundary conditions has been calculated by several groups   @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the point of departure is the qed schwinger problem of infinite parallel plate capacitors infinitely far apart@xcite .",
    "the rate of pair production per unit time per unit volume is @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fermion mass and @xmath37 .    in the mit model , @xmath38 ( with @xmath39 )",
    "is just the string tension @xmath40 . in which case @xmath41",

    "( for reference , we note that those authors denote the string tension by @xmath43 whereas we use @xmath40 . )",

    "henceforth we will assume @xmath49 .",
    "in the following , we work in qed , which is to say , charge is a scalar quantity , plus or minus .",
    "we now consider @xmath52 , since the charge at the ends is shielded due to the flow of opposite charge into the ends",
    ". we will calculate it more carefully in the next section , but it is a good approximation to calculate the current by using the initial radius of the flux tube and the electric field for short times . the number of pairs is proportional to the time , and the mean velocity of a quark is proportional to the time .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the current carried by positive quarks ; negative quarks carry an equal current , including the same sign .",
    "hence the factor of 2 .",
    "we have used the average velocity of quarks @xmath55 , we make the identification @xmath56 .",
    "again we note that @xmath14 is the tube radius at @xmath57 .",

    "here we still employ the adiabatic mit model to follow the dynamics of the flux tube wall by assuming that the tube radius is in instantaneous equilibrium .",
    "in addition to the electric field , the light quark plasma also exerts a pressure on the tube wall .",
    "we assume that only the lowest transverse eigenmode is excited ( @xmath50 ) , so that the tube radius , now denoted by @xmath63 instead of @xmath14 , is determined by minimizing the transverse energy @xmath64 which yields @xmath65 @xmath66 is the number of _ pairs _ per unit length , @xmath67 with @xmath68 the momentum density per unit length for either @xmath22 or @xmath69 . note that we distinguish between the shielded heavy quark charge @xmath70 and the elementary light quark charge @xmath22 , where @xmath71 .",
    "the pair production rate ( per unit length ) is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 .    the transverse motion of the quarks",
    "is now treated relativistically but classically .",
    "thus the relativistic mass is taken to be @xmath74 the rate of change of @xmath68 is governed by the coupled integro - differential equations : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the rate of change of the momentum distribution due to collisions .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath80    we wish to point out the very interesting fact that * no magnetic fields * are produced !",
    "this is because , in maxwell s famous fourth equation , the convection current is exactly cancelled by the displacement current .",
    "one valuable check on the numerics is provided by the agreement between the two forms of eq .",
    "[ eq : n ] .",
    "excellent agreement is attained until numerical instability sets in , when the two values diverge dramatically , in which case time or momentum steps were changed until equality was achieved .",
    "these equations have been solved numerically first without the collision term for several parameter sets .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig2 ] ; the thin lines are for the collisionless solutions .",
    "we note here oscillations with negligible damping . in the absence of damping",
    ", the current continues to flow even when the charge at the end caps ( and hence @xmath10 goes through zero .",
    "consequently the charge at the end caps changes sign , tending to reverse the current .",
    "the number of pairs increases with time .",
    "the energy per unit length also increases ; there is no energy conservation within a segment of the tube .",
    "the problem is simplified by the one - dimensional nature of the dynamics : we assume that the transverse motion can be handled by the adiabatic mit model . scattering between quarks ( charge @xmath22 ) or between quarks and anti - quarks ( charge @xmath81 )",
    "is like that of beads on a string .",
    "the colliding particles exchange momentum with some probability to be computed below .",
    "collisions between identical particles does not alter the momentum distribution ",
    "it is as though no collision took place .",
    "since the interaction is independent of spin and flavor , we do not consider any quark - quark collisions , but only collisions between quarks and antiquarks .",
    "then the change in population density of quarks in momentum satisfies the equation @xmath82 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int dp_2\\,|{\\cal r}(p_1-p_2)|^2 |(v_1-v_2|[n(-p_1)n(p_2)-n(p_1)n(-p_2)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 . here",

    "this provides a useful handle for distinguishing among various flux tube models and , in particular , the appropriate size of @xmath14 .      unlike the plasmas in a fusion reactor , the _ flux _ tube is stable against the sausage instability ; the difference is due to the absence of magnetic fields .",
    "after the electric field had decayed , this stabilizing effect is removed and the _ plasma _ tube falls apart .",
