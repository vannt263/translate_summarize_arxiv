    "multiple - input , multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna systems have evoked a lot of research interest primarily because of the enhanced capacity they provide , compared with that provided by the single antenna point to point channel . moreover , for a system with @xmath11 transmit antennas and @xmath12 receive antennas ( @xmath13 system ) , the maximum _ diversity gain _ ( refer section [ sec_model ] for a definition of diversity gain ) achievable with coherent detection has been shown to be @xmath14 . for mimo systems with the channel state information available only at the receiver ( csir ) , suitably designed space - time block codes ( stbcs ) @xcite provide full - diversity .",
    "full - rate transmission is said to occur if @xmath15 independent information symbols are transmitted in every channel use .",
    "full - rate stbcs achieving full - diversity have also been proposed @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , all full - rate , full - diversity stbcs are characterized by a high ml - decoding complexity ( refer section [ sec_model ] for a formal definition of ml - decoding complexity ) . in general , decoding full - rate stbcs requires jointly decoding @xmath16 symbols .",
    "mimo systems with full channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) or partial csit have been extensively studied in literature . from an information - theoretic perspective",
    ", capacity is an important parameter for mimo systems and waterfilling @xcite can be employed to achieve the capacity with a gaussian codebook . from a signal processing point of view , the error performance of mimo systems using finite constellations is one of the important parameters , and several precoding schemes have been proposed in this regard .",
    "maximal ratio transmission was introduced in @xcite to achieve full - diversity while maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by precoding at the transmitter and equalizing at the receiver for transmission of a single symbol per channel use .",
    "subsequently , the use of precoding and equalizing matrices at the transmitter and the receiver , respectively , was proposed in @xcite to maximize the snr at the receiver , but this scheme resulted in low - rate transmission .",
    "several works on optimal linear precoders and decoders have been done for the _ minimum mean square error _ ( mmse ) criterion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "since these precoders are linear and optimal for the mmse decoding , the decoding complexity is very low and full - diversity is also achieved , but the error performance is worse than that for the ml - decoding .",
    "other non - ml - decoding techniques include lattice - reduction based techniques @xcite which provide full - rate transmission with possibly full - diversity , but lattice - reduction itself involves a high complexity for large mimo systems .",
    "extensive research has also been done on mimo systems with limited feedback to the transmitter about the channel from the receiver ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider mimo systems with full csit .",
    "the channel state information could be either sent to the transmitter by the receiver ( when there are separate frequency bands for uplink and downlink transmission ) or the transmitter could estimate the channel , if it is reciprocal ( like in a time division duplexing ( tdd ) system ) , by receiving pilot signals from the receiver . in literature , to the best of our knowledge , there is no known precoding technique to achieve all the three attributes - full - rate , full - diversity and low ml - decoding complexity ( `` low ml - decoding complexity '' is a relative term and in this paper , it is used to mean the joint decoding of at most 2 complex symbols ) .",
    "almost all the popular precoding techniques with ml - decoding at the receiver use the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the mimo channel @xcite .",
    "the e-@xmath5 precoder for @xmath2-qam @xcite , an extension of the complex - valued optimal precoder @xcite to higher number of transmit antennas , has been shown to perform very well for @xmath2-qam , beating all other linear precoding and decoding schemes based on the mmse criterion , and ml - decoding involves jointly decoding two complex symbols only . however",
    ", this precoder exists in literature for 4-qam alone and is very hard to obtain for larger qam constellations , since it involves a numerical search over 3 parameters .",
    "recently , @xmath17- and @xmath18- precoders have been proposed in @xcite as rivals for the e-@xmath5 precoder .",
    "the @xmath17-precoder has been shown to offer an ml - decoding complexity of @xmath19 ( this can be brought down to @xmath0 by the same decoding scheme as for our precoder , which is explained in subsection [ subsec_compexity ] ) , while the @xmath18-precoder has an ml - decoding complexity which is invariant with respect to the constellation size @xmath1 .",
    "the disadvantage with the @xmath17-precoder is that it loses out to the e-@xmath5 precoder in error performance for @xmath2-qam and it is not known if an explicit expression for the precoding matrix can be obtained for larger qam constellations .",
    "the @xmath18-precoder ( which uses a two - dimensional constellation ) , although explicitly obtainable for constellations of any size @xmath1 , loses out in error performance to the e-@xmath5 precoder , since it has not been optimized for error performance . in literature , all the aforementioned low ml - decoding complexity precoders have been claimed to offer a diversity gain of @xmath20 by the authors ( but the simulation results in this paper indicate that the e-@xmath5 precoder has full - diversity for @xmath2-qam ) .",
    "concerned by the limitations of each of the low ml - decoding complexity precoders , we first propose a real - valued , approximately optimal precoder ( we explain in section [ sec_proposed ] why the precoder is `` approximately optimal '' ) based on the svd of the channel for @xmath21 and then extend it to higher number of transmit antennas , an approach similar to that in @xcite . the ml - decoding complexity offered by our precoder",
    "is shown to be @xmath0 for @xmath1-qam . for @xmath2-qam ,",
    "the proposed precoder has only a marginally poorer error performance than the e-@xmath5 precoder , but has lower ml - decoding complexity . for larger qam constellations , it is easily obtainable , unlike the e-@xmath5 precoder . when compared with the @xmath17- and @xmath18-precoders , it has a much better error performance .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are -    1 .",
    "we propose a novel scheme to obtain an svd - based , real - valued , approximately optimal precoder for @xmath22 transmit antennas and any @xmath1-qam .",
    "the method of obtaining this precoder is different from the one taken to obtain the complex - valued optimal precoder for 2 transmit antennas @xcite , and is easily applicable for any @xmath1-qam , unlike that in @xcite .",
    "2 .   we extend this real - valued precoder to higher number of transmit antennas and show that our precoding scheme offers full - diversity with ml - decoding .",
    "this is a new result as the existing low ml - decoding complexity precoders have been claimed to offer a diversity gain of only @xmath20 .",
    "the simulation plots of the word error probability for @xmath23 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems support our claims about full - diversity .",
    "the ml - decoding complexity of the proposed precoder is shown to be @xmath0 for square @xmath1-qam , in general . however , for a considerable number of channel realizations , no search is required over the @xmath1 signal points . specifically for @xmath2-qam and 2 transmit antennas ,",
    "simulations reveal that for more than @xmath24 of the channel realizations , no search is needed over any of the signal points .",
    "this aspect is elaborated in subsection [ subsec_compexity ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_model ] gives the system model , the relevant definitions and some known results which are needed for our precoder design .",
    "a brief review of existing low ml - decoding complexity precoders is given in section [ sec_low ] the method to obtain the proposed precoder is presented in section [ sec_proposed ] and its ml - decoding complexity is analyzed in subsection [ subsec_compexity ] . in section [ sec_extension ] , we show how this precoding scheme can be extended to higher number of transmit antennas while section [ sec_div_gain ] deals with the achievable diversity gain with the proposed precoder .",

    "note that the above definition of the ml - decoding complexity is with respect to the _ worst - case _ ml - decoding complexity .",

    "<S> precoding for multiple - input , multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna systems is considered with perfect channel knowledge available at both the transmitter and the receiver . for 2 transmit antennas and qam constellations , an approximately optimal ( with respect to the minimum euclidean distance between points in the received signal space ) real - valued precoder based on the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the channel is proposed , and it is shown to offer a maximum - likelihood ( ml)-decoding complexity of @xmath0 for square @xmath1-qam . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed precoder is obtainable easily for arbitrary qam constellations , unlike the known complex - valued optimal precoder by collin et al . for 2 transmit antennas , which is in existence for @xmath2-qam alone with an ml - decoding complexity of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and </S>",
    "<S> is extremely hard to obtain for larger qam constellations . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed precoder s loss in error performance for 4-qam in comparison with the complex - valued optimal precoder is only marginal . </S>",
    "<S> our precoding scheme is extended to higher number of transmit antennas on the lines of the e-@xmath5 precoder for @xmath2-qam by vrigneau et al . which is an extension of the complex - valued optimal precoder for @xmath2-qam . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the recently proposed @xmath6 and @xmath7precoders , the error performance of our precoder is significantly better . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that our precoder provides full - diversity for qam constellations and this is supported by simulation plots of the word error probability for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems .    </S>",
