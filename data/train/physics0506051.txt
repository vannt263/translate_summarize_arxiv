    "_ _ blog _ _ is a diary published on the author s website . because the internet is used as a medium , authors feel free to express their opinions and views on different subjects , without fear of censorship .      as _ blogging _",
    "becomes very popular , many internet portals offer ( mostly free of charge ) blogging facilities to their customers .",
    "that causes aggregation of blogs in one `` place '' , and encourages building communities .",
    "bloggers ( as we call people who run their blogs ) very often place hypertext links to their friends and colleagues sharing similar views or describing similar subjects .",
    "such connections create what we call _ blog networks _ which are subject of our research .",
    "we examined three different polish blogging services :    1 .   *",
    "blog.onet.pl *  one of the most popular services , about @xmath1 registered blogs 2 .",
    "* blog.gery.pl *  moderately known service , about @xmath2 blogs 3 .",
    "* jogger.pl *  niche service , gathering mostly tech - savvy people , only around @xmath3 blogs    it should noted that many of blogs may be abandoned by their authors and no longer updated .",
    "they are still available however , and were taken into the account .",
    "we used standard gnu / linux tools to automate process of collecting the data :    * text - mode _ lynx _ browser for downloading the content of www pages * _ grep _ for filtering out unnecessary information * _ sort _ for sorting the blog list * _ uniq _ for removing the duplicate blog list entries * _ bash _ shell which provided a scripting framework    usually blogging services provide users with possibility of listing all existing blogs .",
    "we used this feature to create a list of all bloggers for each service .",
    "for example jogger.pl blog list has the following url :    http://jogger.pl/users.php?sort=1&start=offset    where offset is the cgi parameter for specifying position in the list .",
    "it has 100 blog links presented on each page , so it was possible to gather all the blog links by starting from offset=0 and increasing it by 100 in a loop until no more blogs were presented . in each loop",
    "iteration content of the list page was downloaded by using _ lynx _",
    "browser in html source dump mode .",
    "then _ grep _ was used to filter out all data apart from blog url addresses .",
    "we found it convenient to sort the resulting list and remove duplicate entries .",
    "when the list was ready , content of every listed blog page was downloaded and links to other blogs in the same service were filtered out in similar manner . in the result , list of all outgoing connections for each blogger in the service was created .",
    "this process was repeated for each examined blogging service .",
    "this section presents results of quantitive analysis performed on data collected from the services we examined .",
    "the terminology we used comes from the graph theory . each blog",
    "is represented by a vertex in the connection graph .",
    "average vertex degrees for each service :    1 .   * blog.onet.pl * : @xmath4 2 .   *",
    "blog.gery.pl * : @xmath5 3 .",
    "* jogger.pl * : @xmath6",
    "it s clearly seen that these graphs are very sparse .",
    "we ll try to show that the function of degree distribution is of power  law type : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents vertex degree .",
    "histograms presented in figures  [ degrees1 ] ,  [ degrees2 ] and  [ degrees3 ] are very similar , even though number of blogs in each service is different by an order of magnitude .",
    "that shows us that scaling is also very similar in these networks .",
    "@xmath0 coefficients of the vertices degree functions are presented in table  [ tabgamma ] below .",
    "@xmath9 represents the square of the correlation coefficient .",
    ".@xmath0 coefficients of the vertices degree functions [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     having given number of isolated persons from particular blog service , it is possible to establish group integration index . the integration index is calculated with the following method @xcite :    @xmath10    these are respectively : @xmath11 , @xmath12 .    as a result of computer - aided calculations",
    "we have been able to determine the number of blog pairs for blog.onet.pl and blog.gery.pl services where authors chose each other mutually ( placed links in their weblogs ) . for blog.gery.pl",
    "this was 554 of total 14861 ; in case of blog.onet.pl this value reached 21160 of total number of 141755 weblogs .",
    "connection index is given by formula @xcite : @xmath13 consequently , connection indices for these blogs are respectively : @xmath14 , @xmath15 . notice that despite a tenfold population difference between the two services , connection indices differ only about 2 times .",
    "_ idol _ is a sociometric structure which describes person who got the large number of positive choices , though making small number of choices by itself ( that means that it has small positive expansion)@xcite . with",
    "_ idol _ is connected the person of _ eminence grise _  who is the person chosen by _ idol _ ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ r4 ] ) .",
    "blog jpc ( shown in fig .",
    "[ r5 ] ) is an _ idol _ with relatively large positive expansion ( 21 choices ) .",
    "_ eminence grise _ is clearly visible ( blog antlan ) , and is chosen by jpc without mutuality .",
    "text analysis suggests that authors of both blogs are friends from university , from the `` real '' life .",
    "the more experienced user ( jpc ) promotes his friend s weblog in bloggers community .",
    "this however does not work very well  although blog jpc was established in november 2003 and is regularly updated , blog antlan is an ephemeron .",
    "for the 5 months of its existence it was updated only once .    in the fig .",
    "[ diada_triada ] the basic sociometric structures are presented  _ diad _ which is mutual positive choice between 2 persons and _ triad _ which is mutual positive choice among 3 persons @xcite .             in the left picture of fig .",
    "[ r6 ] the example of _ triad _ is shown  three mutual choices from jogger.pl service .",
    "one can see that the positive expansion of these blogs is small , despite relatively high sociometric status ( with blog _ kalma _ having the smallest number of choices within the _ triad _ ) .",
    "text analysis provides explanation of this  all three blogs belong to one family , a marriage with a 2 years old child .",
    "_ koraga _ is a blog describing events from child s life written from its `` point of view '' by his mother , _ kalma _ is a weblog of its father while _ ika _ belongs to mother .",
    "right picture of fig .",
    "[ r6 ] shows the chain structure consisting of a number of _",
    "diads_. text analysis shows that these people are connected with historical internet portal _",
    "histmag_. such choice structure has been established despite large outlook differences .",
    "sparsity is the first apparent property of examined blogs networks .",
    "the highest observed average vertex degree is @xmath16 , that means that most of the vertices are not connected with others at all ( about @xmath17 ) .",
    "@xmath0 coefficients describing power  law of the decay of the vertex degree function is below @xmath18 in all examined services .",
    "that indicates that blogs are in fact scale  free networks @xcite .",
    "we do nt observe notable increase of the average path length along with the increasing graph size .",
    "while the number of vertices of _ blog.onet.pl _ and _ blog.gery.pl _ services differs by order of magnitude , the difference between their average path lengths is only @xmath19 .",
    "it can be observed that as the graph is growing , we do nt need respectively longer paths to `` travel '' between its vertices . that property is called _ small world",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the proportion between strong and weak relations in cliques does nt change with the size of the graph . however , small graphs are dominated by very dense ( many connections ) and loose cliques(no connections at all , isolated vertices ) . that contrast could be explained by saying that in smaller communities some people are very sociable , while others do nt tend to `` connect '' with others at all .",
    "more balanced behaviour is rare .    in larger graphs ,",
    "average cliquity is much greater ( almost an order of magnitude ) than in smaller ones , so we reckon that larger structures tend to help building stronger relations between their participants . in smaller structures",
    "the border between the `` liked '' and isolated ones is much stronger .",
    "we also tried to implement a sociometric analysis method , a domain of microsociology , to analyse a large net of virtual interpersonal connections .",
    "although treating blog networks as such can be controversial , we believe that for the purpose of this analysis such interpretation can be proved valid .    in large groups",
    "it is possible to find some regular sociometric structures .",
    "structures described in this work were sociologically explainable despite vast differences of relationships among blog authors .",
