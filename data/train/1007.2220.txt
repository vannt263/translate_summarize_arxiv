    "a new era of nuclear matter research is envisaged with the @xmath5  gev upgrade of the cebaf accelerator at the jefferson lab in the usa and with the construction of the fair facility in germany .",
    "these new facilities will have the exciting potential of implanting low - momentum charmonia and charmed hadrons in an atomic nucleus , like the @xmath0 and @xmath6 mesons and heavy - light charmed mesons such as @xmath1 and @xmath2 . while at jlab charmed hadrons will be produced by scattering electrons off nuclei , at fair they",
    "will be produced by the annihilation of antiprotons on nuclei .",
    "there are several reasons for the excitement , one of the main ones being the opportunity of studying the poorly understood low - energy excitations of gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "an example where these excitations play an important role is the propagation of charmonia in matter . since a charmonium state does not have quarks in common with the nuclear medium , its interactions with the medium",
    "necessarily involve the intervention of gluons .",
    "basic interaction mechanisms discussed in the literature have been the excitation of qcd van der waals forces arising from the exchange of two or more gluons between color - singlet states  @xcite , and the excitation of charmed hadronic intermediate states with light quarks created from the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "another interesting challenge is to study the properties of charmed @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in medium .",
    "the chiral properties of the light quarks that compose these mesons are much more sensitive to the nuclear medium than their companion , heavier charm quarks and therefore they offer the unique opportunity of studying phenomena like the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter .",
    "motivated by such considerations , some very interesting phenomena involving these mesons have been predicted . amongst these",
    "we mention the possible formation of @xmath7 meson - nuclear bound states  @xcite , enhanced dissociation of @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter ( heavy nuclei )  @xcite , and enhancement of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 meson production in antiproton - nucleus collisions  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite presents a recent review of the properties of charmonium states and compiles a fairly complete list of references on theoretical studies concerning a great variety of physics issues related to these states . on the experimental side ,",
    "one of the major challenges is to find appropriate kinematical conditions to produce these hadrons essentially at rest , or with small momentum relative to the nucleus , as effects of the nuclear medium are driven by low energy interactions .",
    "the original suggestion  @xcite was that qcd van der waals forces arising from multiple gluon exchange would be capable of binding a charmonium state by as much as @xmath9  mev in an @xmath10 nucleus .",
    "the estimate was based on a variational calculation using a phenomenological ansatz for the charmonium - nucleus potential in the form of a yukawa potential . along the same lines but taking into account the distribution of nucleons in the nucleus by folding the charmonium - nucleon yukawa potential with the nuclear density distribution , ref .",
    "@xcite found a maximum of @xmath11  mev binding energy in a large nucleus .",
    "a somewhat more qcd - oriented estimate was made in ref .",
    "@xcite . using a lowest - order multipole expansion for the coupling of multiple gluons to a small - size charmonium bound state  @xcite",
    ", it is possible to show on the basis of the operator product expansion that the mass shift of charmonium in nuclear matter is given , in the limit of infinitely heavy charm quark mass , by an expression similar to the usual second - order stark effect in atomic physics , which depends on the chromo - electric polarizability of the nucleon . using an estimate  @xcite for the value of this polarizability , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained a @xmath12  mev binding for @xmath0 in nuclear matter . on the other hand , for the excited charmonium states ,",
    "a much larger binding energy was obtained , e.g. @xmath13  mev for the excited charmonium state @xmath14 , an admittedly untrustworthy number . following this same procedure , but keeping the charm quark mass finite and using realistic charmonium bound - state wave - functions , ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath15  mev binding energy for @xmath0 in nuclear matter , but still over @xmath16  mev binding for the charmonium excited states . while an increase in the qcd stark effect is expected for excited states ( because of their larger size ) , the extreme values for the binding energies for these states found in the literature are widely considered to be unrealistic .",
    "the source for such an overestimate is attributed to the breakdown of the multipole expansion for the larger - sized charmonium states .",
    "there are some other studies on charmonium interactions with ordinary hadrons and nuclear matter , in particular involving the @xmath0 meson .",
    "qcd sum rules studies estimated a @xmath0 mass decrease in nuclear matter ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 mev  @xcite , while an estimate based on color polarizability  @xcite gave larger than @xmath19 mev . in addition , there are studies of the charmonium - nucleon interaction and of @xmath0 dissociation cross sections based on a one - boson exchange model  @xcite , effective lagrangians  @xcite and the quark - model  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the charmonium - hadron interaction was studied in lattice qcd .    a first estimate for the mass shifts of charmonium states ( we denote charmonium states generically by @xmath6 ) in nuclear medium arising from the excitation of a pair of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons ",

    "these results were obtained for density - dependent @xmath1 and @xmath23 masses that decrease linearly with density , such that at @xmath22 they are shifted by @xmath24  mev .",
    "the loop integral in the self - energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] ) is divergent and was regularized using form - factors derived from the @xmath25 decay model with quark - model wave functions for @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "the positive mass shift is at first sight puzzling , since even with a @xmath24  mev reduction of the @xmath1 masses , the intermediate state is still above threshold for the decay of @xmath0 into a @xmath26 pair and so a second - order contribution should be negative .",
    "as we shall explain below , this was not realized in the calculation of ref .",
