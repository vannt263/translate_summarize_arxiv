    "the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence , which introduced by maldacena in 1998 @xcite , has provided a method to study the strong coupled field theories in a weakly coupled dual gravitational description @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "one of the significant achievements of this duality is that the gravitational physics has been connected with the condensed matter physics @xcite , which presents a tractable model governing superconductivity for non - standard dynamical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "it is found that the properties of a ( @xmath1)-dimensional superconductor can indeed be reproduced in the ( @xmath2)-dimensional holographic dual model in the background of ads black hole , which requires a system that admits black holes with scalar hair at low temperature but no hair at high temperature @xcite . along this line ,",
    "there have been accumulated interest to investigate various gravity models with the property of the so - called holographic superconductor , for reviews , see ref . @xcite and references therein .    in most cases , the studies on the holographic superconductors focus on the einstein - maxwell theory . in order to understand the influences of the @xmath3 or @xmath4 (",
    "@xmath5 is the t hooft coupling ) corrections on the holographic dual models , there have been a lot of works studying the holographic superconductors with the higher derivative correction related to the gravity @xcite and the gauge field @xcite .",
    "recently , an s - wave holographic dual model with weyl corrections has been constructed in order to explore the effects beyond the large @xmath6 limit on the holographic superconductor @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , in strong contrast to the higher curvature corrections @xcite , the higher weyl corrections make it easier for the condensation to form and change the expected relation in the gap frequency . generalizing the investigation on the holographic superconductor model in the st@xmath7ckelberg mechanism , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that different values of weyl correction term and model parameters can determine the order of phase transitions and critical exponents of second - order phase transitions .",
    "more recently , there seems to have developed increasing interest in investigation of weyl corrections on the holographic dual models @xcite .    as a matter of fact , the form of the higher derivative corrections is not unique . in ref .",
    "@xcite , myers , sachdev and singh introduced another form of higher order corrections related to the gauge field @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the @xmath10 coupling parameter .",
    "they argued that this correction term arises from the kaluza - klein reduction of five dimensional gauss - bonnet gravity and can produce second - order equations of motion for both the gauge field and metric in any general background @xcite .",
    "cai and pang studied the holographic properties of charged black holes with @xmath10 corrections and observed that this correction will affect the dc conductivity @xcite . considering this new form of higher derivative corrections ,",
