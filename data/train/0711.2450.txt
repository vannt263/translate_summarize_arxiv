    "the information about the neutrino distribution function , in the flavor basis and at a given temperature , is an essential element in the calculation of the neutron decay rate , which is a critical quantity entering bbn @xcite .",

    "this is , indeed , a severe constraint on neutrino mixing since a higher predicted abundance of @xmath1he may be in conflict with observational data @xcite .",
    "another constraint on active - sterile neutrino mixing is the neutrino mass derived from cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( cmb ) @xcite.the analysis of constraints presented in @xcite focus on the mixing scheme at the level of the neutrino mass hierarchy , and it suggests the adequacy of the non - degenerate mass hierarchy to set limits on the mass difference between active and sterile neutrinos , @xmath3 .",

    "the mixing of sterile and active neutrinos affects the leptonic fractional occupancies , which are essential quantities appearing in the expression of the weak decay rates .",
    "thus , one needs to know , as input of the calculations , the parameters of the proposed mixing scheme , the neutrino mass hierarchy and the leptonic densities @xcite . with these elements",

    "the details of the calculations have been discussed elsewhere @xcite , for the case of two neutrino mass eigenstates . the final expression for the neutron to proton decay rate is obtained by fixing the normalization @xmath61 , of eq.([lnp ] ) , from the neutron half - life @xmath62 and the result is @xmath63 \\left(\\frac{1}{y^3}+\\frac{6}{y^4}+\\frac{12}{y^5}\\right ) + \\frac{255}{4 \\tau } \\frac{\\sin^2 2 \\phi}{2}e^{\\eta } \\int_0^\\infty dq q^2 \\left(q+1\\right)^2 e^{-q y}g\\left(q , y\\right ) , \\label{lnp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in units of @xmath64 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , the neutron abundance , until the freeze - out of weak interactions , is expressed in terms of the neutron to proton decay rate , @xmath65 of eq.([lnp1 ] ) as @xmath66 the quantity @xmath67 is , therefore , a function of @xmath65 and , consequently , of the occupation factors @xmath68 , which contain the information about the mixing between active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "the next step consists on the calculation of primordial nuclear abundances .",
    "the method to calculate the bbn abundances was presented in ref @xcite .",
    "it is a semi - analytic approach based on the balance between production and destruction of a given nuclear element , which requires the knowledge of @xmath67 . for details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the above presented framework shows that the calculation of primordial abundances may indeed be taken as a tool to test leptonic mechanisms , like the mixing between sterile and active neutrinos , as it has been pointed out by kishimoto et al .",
    "to perform the calculations we have adopted the oscillation parameters determined from sno , sk and chooz measurements @xcite .",

    "we have then calculated the neutron abundance , by applying the formalism of the previous section .",
    "the primordial abundances of d , @xmath0he , @xmath1he and @xmath2li , have been calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "the baryonic density @xmath12 ( see ref.@xcite ) was varied within the limits @xmath72 . concerning the value of @xmath47",
    "we have varied it in the interval determined by the allowed values of the potential lepton number , @xmath73 , that is @xmath74 @xcite . in the present calculations we have adopted the values",
    "@xmath75 which are consistent with the densities @xmath76 @xcite .    to determine the allowed values of the mixing angle @xmath24 we have performed a @xmath8-minimization , after computing the primordial abundances .",

    "figure 1.(a ) , the absolute minimum is located at @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , both set of results have been obtained by using the solution ( [ fln ] ) for the occupations .",
    "the smallness of the mixing angle does not contradict lsnd results @xcite , but the value of the baryonic density is outside the limits determined by wmap @xcite , that is : @xmath79 .",
    "this disagreement between theory and data may be caused by large uncertainties in the @xmath2li - data . as pointed out by richard et al .",
    "@xcite , the validity of the data on @xmath2li may be questioned by the uncertainties inherent to the physics of @xmath2li in the interior of the stars , i.e ; the turbulent transport in the radiative zone of stars .",
    "in contrast , the situation improves if the data on @xmath2li are removed at the time of performing the statistical analysis ( figure 1.(b ) ) . for this case ,",
    "the best value of the mixing angle is @xmath80 , and the baryonic density corresponding to the minimum , @xmath81 , is indeed consistent with the wmap data .",
    "the anomalous feature associated with the inclusion of @xmath2li in the set of data persists if other elements are removed from the data .",
    "we have verified it by systematically removing , one at the time , the abundances of d , @xmath0he , and @xmath1he , and keeping the data on @xmath2li . in all cases",
    "the location of the minimum lies closer to the one of figure 1.(a ) . for the case of inverse mass hierarchy the occupation factor ( [ fli ] ) is strongly constrained by the value of @xmath41 and the difference with respect to the thermal occupation factor vanishes .",
    "it means that the contour plot shows , for the inverse mass hierarchy , parallel lines to the vertical axis ( @xmath82 ) , since all possible values of @xmath82 are allowed by eq .",

    "@xcite have demonstrated the sensitivity of the @xmath1he abundance on the distortion of the light neutrino spectrum produced by the mixing with a sterile neutrino . in our case , the statistical analysis of the compatibility between theoretical and observed nuclear abundances , indicates the existence of a clear sensitivity of the results upon active - sterile neutrino mixing , too . in performing our analysis ,",
