    "this paper describes an interdisciplinary effort towards developing better computational models for simulation of heterojunction interfaces in semiconductors .",
    "the motivation comes from collaborations of computational mathematicians and physicists with material scientists who build such interfaces and examine their properties for the purpose of building more efficient solar cells .",
    "ultimately the design of the devices with complicated geometries and/or new parameters must be supported by computational simulations .",
    "below we overview the relevant technological and physics concepts and summarize the computational modeling challenges addressed in this paper .",
    "the experimental and computational search for more efficient solar cells can be divided into two approaches : a ) the discovery and design of new materials on which to base the existing thin - film solar cell designs ( second generation photovoltaics ) , and b ) the minimization of loss mechanisms inherent in the design of current solar cell designs through the realization and exploitation of new physical effects ( third generation photovoltaics ) @xcite .",
    "a thin - film solar cell is built around a semiconductor layer , where the light is absorbed and charge carriers ( electron - hole pairs ) are created , sandwiched by , on one side , the electron conducting layers , and on the other side , by hole conducting layers .",
    "at least one of these conducting layers must be transparent to the solar spectrum for light to reach the central `` absorber '' layer , see figure  [ fig - cigsstack ] .",
    "each interface between two layers in a thin - film solar cell constitutes a _ heterojunction _ , which must be carefully tuned to optimize the overall performance of the solar cell .",
    "current thin - film solar cells are built around either cadmium telluride ( cdte ) or copper indium gallium selenide , cuin@xmath0ga@xmath1se@xmath2 , ( cigs ) as semiconductors for the absorber layer .",
    "large scale deployment of these established technologies is potentially impacted by the toxicity ( e.g. , cadmium ) or relative expense ( e.g. , indium ) of some of the constitutent materials .",
    "hence , the search for alternative absorber semiconductors focuses on earth abundant constituents that are nontoxic @xcite . for each new candidate material , new conducting layers ,",
    "one of which has to be transparent , must be found and matched to each other by optimizing the heterojunction interface between each pair of layers .",

    "the well known _ drift - diffusion model _ is the most widely used continuum mathematical model for semiconductor devices , and , in particular , for solar cells .",
    "we refer to @xcite for extensive background and recent extensions .",
    "it can be derived from semi - classical transport theory based on the boltzmann equation together with the poisson equation and a number of assumptions , most importantly the introduction of a phenomelogical relaxation time and thermal equilibrium for the charge carriers .",
    "even though these assumptions limit the validity of the drift - diffusion model to low energies and longer time scales , it generally provides an adequate description of the steady - state transport in solar cells , except in cases where its assumptions are explicitly violated , as is generally the case for all approaches to solar energy conversion that attempt to harvest high energy photons more efficiently ( so called third generation photovoltaics @xcite ) .",
    "more sophisticated models that includes high field and high energy effects as well as short time - scale phenomena , include hydrodynamic transport models that go beyond the boltzmann transport equation ( see for example ref . 2 in @xcite ) , as well as particle based monte carlo models @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for an example of coupling and comparison of hydrodynamic and monte carlo models .",
    "a computationally efficient approach would treat only the _ _ c__ritical regions with a more sophisticated model , which is coupled to the standard drift - diffusion model to create a complete device simulation .",
    "such an approach is the ultimate aim of our work on heterojunctions but is outside the scope of the present paper .    despite the simplifying assumptions in the drift - diffusion system ,",
    "it is quite complex , and presents challenges for analysis , numerical discretization , and nonlinear solver techniques .",
    "the difficulties include the nonlinear coupled nature of the system , the presence of boundary and interior layers , and the out - of - double precision scaling of data and unknowns , which render the model difficult to work with for computational scientists without prior experience .",
    "the presence of a heterojunction adds to that complexity . consider a 1d semiconductor region @xmath12 made of two materials , with an _ interface region _",
    "@xmath13 located near @xmath14 , as shown in figure  [ fig - domain ] .",
    "processes in @xmath8 where the two materials meet are characterized , e.g. , by steep gradients and discontinuities of the primary variables , and can not be resolved on the scale of drift - diffusion models .",
    "one way to model heterojunctions is via an atomic scale model such as density functional theory ( dft ) in @xmath8 which however can not simulate more than a few atomic layers @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use an approximation of the interface region by a lower - dimensional interface @xmath15 @xcite , as in figure  [ fig - domain ] , along with a separate mathematical model approximating the physical phenomena across the interface .",
    "this is described , e.g. , in @xcite , and heterojunction models have been implemented , e.g. , in community codes such as 1d semiconductor modeling programs amps @xcite and scaps @xcite .",

    "instead , in this paper we take a step in the direction of a future coupled continuum  discrete model by decomposing functionally the continuum heterojunction model into subdomain parts on @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the interface part @xmath15 . in simulations we use realistic interface parameters computed by the dft model on @xmath8 which is , however , entirely decoupled from the continuum model .",
    "a substantial part of this paper is devoted to the careful modeling of the interface equations elucidating the challenges and unusual features as compared to the traditional transmission conditions in which the primary variables and their normal fluxes are continuous .",
    "we also reformulate the heterojunction model using domain decomposition method ( ddm ) @xcite which , to our knowledge , has not been applied to heterojunction models .",
    "( throughout the paper we use ddm to denote concepts related to domain decomposition , in an effort to avoid confusion with the drift - diffusion equations ) .",
    "we present preliminary results of our ddm algorithm as applied to each step of the gummel loop for homojunctions as well as to the potential equation for heterojunctions , and these results are promising .",
    "ddm requires that we carefully examine the behavior of the primary variables and their fluxes across the interface .",
    "in fact , the former lack continuity , and the primary variables either have a step jump , or satisfy a nonlinear robin - like condition .",
    "we find similarities of the heterojunction model to various fluid flow models that have recently attracted substantial attention in the mathematical and numerical community .",
    "analysis in @xcite and modeling and simulations for flow across cracks and barriers in @xcite have been pursued .",

    "still , the heterojunction problem appears even more complex than ( some of ) those listed above due to its coupled nature and nonlinear form of the interface conditions as well as to the complexities of the subdomain problems .",
    "clearly nontrivial mathematical and computational analyses following @xcite as well as semiconductor - specific implementations are needed , but the formulation given here opens avenues towards applications of modern numerical analysis techniques beyond the finite differences that have been traditionally employed .",
    "in particular , the ddm solver given here can be easily extended to multiple interfaces or complex 2d geometries .",
    "in contrast , such extensions may be very difficult for monolithic solvers in which the interface equations are hard - coded .",
