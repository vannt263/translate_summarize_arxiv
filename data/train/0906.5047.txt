    "the idea of inflation is a very successful paradigm to solve the problems of the standard cosmology and it provides a basis for production and evolution of seeds for large scale structure of the universe [ 1,2 ] . from a thermodynamical viewpoint ,",
    "there are two possible alternatives to inflationary dynamics : standard picture is isentropic inflation referred to as supercooled inflation . in this picture",
    ", universe expands in inflation phase and its temperature decrease rapidly .",
    "when inflation ends , a reheating period introduces radiation into the universe .",
    "the fluctuations in this type of inflation model are zero - point ground state fluctuations and evolution of the inflaton field is governed by ground state evolution equations . in this model",
    "we have not any thermal perturbations and therefore density perturbations are adiabatic ( or curvature ) .",
    "the other picture is a non - isentropic inflation , the so called warm inflation .",
    "warm inflation has no need to introduce reheating phase since interaction between the inflaton and other fields in this scenario produces the radiation energy density . in this picture",
    ", inflation terminates smoothly and radiation regime is dominated without a reheating period .",
    "the fluctuations during warm inflation emerge from some excited states and the evolution of the inflaton has dissipative terms arising from interaction of the inflaton and other fields [ 3,4 ] which affects the inflaton dynamics through a noise term in the equations of motion [ 5,6 ] ( for a comprehensive list of the references on warm inflation , see [ 7 ] ) . the important point in the warm inflation scenario",
    "is that the density fluctuations in this scenario arise from thermal rather than vacuum fluctuations [ 3,6,8 ] and the fluctuations in the radiation produce the entropy ( isocurvature ) perturbations .",
    "the thermal fluctuations during warm inflation lead to production of necessary initial seeds for large scale structure ( lss ) formation .",
    "the warm inflation ends when the radiation is dominated in the universe and the universe enters in a standard big bang phase [ 4,9 ] .",
    "the entropy fluctuations disappear before inflation ends . + the goal of this investigation is to study cosmological perturbations in a braneworld viewpoint of the warm inflation in the presence of interaction between inflaton and modified induced gravity on the brane . among various braneworld scenarios ,",
    "the model proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) [ 10 ] predicts deviations from the standard @xmath2-dimensional gravity even over large distances . in this scenario ,",
    "the transition between four and @xmath3-dimensional gravitational potentials arises due to the presence of an induced gravity term in the brane action .",
    "existence of a higher dimensional embedding space allows for the existence of bulk or brane matter which can certainly influence the cosmological dynamics on the brane . in the dgp setup ,",
    "the bulk is a flat minkowski spacetime , but a reduced gravity term appears on the brane without tension .",
    "this model has a rich phenomenology discussed in [ 11 ] .",
    "maeda , mizuno and torii have constructed a braneworld scenario which combines the randall - sundrum ii ( rs ii ) and the dgp model [ 12 ] . in this combination ,",
    "an induced curvature term appears on the brane in the rs ii scenario which contains an ads bulk .",
    "this model has been called the warped dgp braneworld in the literature [ 13 ] .",
    "the supercooled inflation models in this scenario were studied in minimal and non - minimal cases [ 13 - 17 ] .",
    "warm inflation model on a warped dgp brane in the minimal case has been studied by del campo and herrera [ 18 ] , but here we consider the effects of the non - minimal coupling of the scalar field and modified induced gravity on the brane because one important feature of the inflationary paradigm is the fact that inflaton can interact with other fields such as gravitational sector of the theory .",
    "this interaction is shown by the non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field and modified induced curvature in the spirit of the scalar - tensor theories , which is motivated from several compelling reasons ( for a discussion on the reasons to include an explicit non - minimal coupling between inflaton and gravitational sector in a typical inflation model , see [ 19 ] ) .",
    "in fact , inclusion of the non - minimal coupling in our setup is not just a matter of taste ; it is forced upon us since as has been indicated in [ 19 ] , in most theories used to describe inflationary scenarios , it turns out that a non - vanishing value of the coupling constant can not be avoided .",
    "+ to have a complete treatment of the problem , we consider possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane in the spirit of the @xmath0-gravity .",
    "the main motivation for adopting such a framework is the fact that although inflation is an elegant scenario to resolve some shortcomings of the standard cosmology and provides a causal and predictive theory of structure formation , there are some important and yet unsolved problems in it [ 20 ] .",
    "hierarchy problem , trans - planckian problem and singularity problem are among these problems .",
    "modification of the induced gravity in the spirit of @xmath0 theories may provide a reliable framework to solve at least part of these problems .",
    "in another words , incorporation of the modified induced gravity on the brane in the spirit of higher order gravitational theories may shed more light on these problems .",
    "in fact , @xmath0-gravity is the simplest way to achieve this goal and it is also possible to obtain a nonsingular cosmology in this setup . for a review on @xmath0-gravity and also inflation and cosmic acceleration in modified gravity see [ 21 ] . in this paper",

    "this pressure controls the evolution of the curvature perturbation on large scales during inflation .",
    "in fact in the presence of entropy perturbations the primordial curvature perturbation is not constant after horizon crossing , so the relevant value to be compared with observations should be evaluated at most at the end of inflation . in this respect , this quantity should be evaluated at the end of inflation [ 45 ] . for @xmath43 ,",

    "now we pay attention to the tensorial perturbations . as it has been mentioned in ref.[48 ] , the generation of tensor perturbations during inflation period produces stimulated emission in the thermal background of gravitational waves .",

    "the number of e - folds is given by the surface enclosed between this curve and two vertical lines located at @xmath303 and @xmath304 corresponding to @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "as this figure shows , the number of e - folds increases by increasing dissipation factor .    finally , we note that the self - accelerating solution of the dgp setup is unstable due to existence of ghosts [ 51,52 ] . in our setup ,",
    "incorporation of several new degrees of freedom such as modified induced gravity , non - minimal coupling and the warped geometry of the bulk has provided a relatively wider parameter space .",
    "this wider parameter space may provide a better framework to treat instabilities of the self - accelerating solution .",
    "however this is not an easy task and lies out of our interest here ( for a recent progress in this direction see [ 53 ] ) .",

    "the cosmological perturbations are treated with complete details and the roles played by modification of the induced gravity , dissipation and the non - minimal coupling are discussed .",
    "the main results of our study can be summarized as follows : in the minimal standard theory of cosmological perturbations , when there are no dissipation effects , all perturbations are adiabatic and there is no trace of the non - adiabatic perturbations .",
    "but , as we have shown here , in a dgp - inspired non - minimal setup with modified induced gravity , in the absence of dissipation there is a non - vanishing contribution of the non - adiabatic perturbations . in this setup",
    ", this effect is mainly as a result of dgp ( with modified induced gravity ) than the non - minimal coupling .",
    "the effect of the non - minimal coupling tends to increase the contribution of the entropy perturbations .",
    "the numerical analysis of the parameter space ( which is wide enough due to incorporation of several new degrees of freedom ) shows that it is possible to have both red and blue spectrum and relatively large running of the spectral index depending on the sign of the non - minimal coupling . however , negative values of the non - minimal coupling give results that are not supported by observations and therefore should be excluded from our considerations .",
    "the effect of dissipation is so that the slow - roll parameter @xmath94 decreases by increasing the dissipation factor .",
    "however , the number of e - folds increases by increasing the dissipation factor .",
    "modification of the induced gravity and its coupling to the inflaton field in a warm inflation framework brings a variety of new possibilities which constraint our model in comparison with the recent observations . in other words ,",
    "this wider parameter space provides much more freedom than single , self - interacting scalar field inflation to fit with the observational data .",
