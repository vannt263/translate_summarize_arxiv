    "inflation well explains the origin of primordial density fluctuations , as well as flatness and homogeneity of our universe .",
    "the general idea is so far quite successful , and inflationary models are confronted with precise observational data  @xcite . since inflation is a high - energy phenomenon , it is important to study it in a more fundamental framework such as supergravity  @xcite which is well motivated by particle physics and string theory . in particular , should tensor perturbations be detected in a near future , it would imply large ( trans - planckian ) excursions of the inflaton field  @xcite . then the planck - suppressed corrections can not be neglected .",
    "even if supersymmetry is broken at a higher scale than that of inflation , supergravity corrections have substantial impact on the scalar potential .",
    "as is well known , a generic scalar potential in supergravity tends to be very steep in the large - field region , because of the exponential factor of the khler potential .",
    "accordingly , it is hard to achieve flatness of the scalar potential along the whole inflationary trajectory in the case of large - field models .",
    "therefore , some symmetries are usually imposed in the inflationary model building in supergravity .",
    "a good example is the axion - like shift symmetry in the non - susy model  @xcite and in the supergravity - based models  @xcite .",
    "the similar approach , assuming the global u(1 ) symmetry and the related monodromy structure of the superpotential , is known as the helical - phase inflation , because its inflaton is identified with the phase component of a complex scalar field rolling down a helicoid potential  @xcite .",
    "like in the more conventional shift - symmetric approach , a stabilizer superfield is used in the all known helical - phase inflationary models .",
    "actually , the inflationary models with the non - compact u(1 ) and those based on the shift symmetry ( with or without a stabilizer superfield ) are equivalent , being related by the inflaton superfield redefinition @xmath7 .",
    "still , it makes sense to study them separately because adding a simple symmetry - breaking or stabilizing term in one approach often leads to a complicated structure in the other approach .    in the shift - symmetric approach",
    ", a stabilizer superfield is needed to ensure positivity of the potential . in our previous work",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we proposed the alternative framework to achieve the same goal by stabilizing the scalar superpartner of the inflaton . in our approach ,",
    "a number of the physical degrees of freedom was reduced , while a quartic shift - symmetric term was added to the khler potential .    in this letter",
    ", we study the helical - phase inflation without a stabilizer superfield . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stabilize ] the radial part is stabilized by employing a higher - order ( polynomial ) term in the khler potential , similarly to refs .",
    "the inflaton is identified with the pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson of the approximate u(1 ) symmetry of the khler potential .",
    "a few particular models are studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the natural ( reduced ) planck units , @xmath8 .",
    "should the inflationary trajectory be along the phase direction in the helical phase inflation , the radial direction has to be constant during inflation .",
    "for example , in the lln model it is achieved by taking the superpotential proportional to a negative power of the inflaton .",
    "balancing the superpotential contribution diverging at the origin with the exponentially rising contribution due to the khler potential results in the stabilization of the radial part at a value of the order of the planck scale .",
    "in our case without a stabilizer superfield , the inflaton potential includes both the superpotential itself and its derivative , and the formulae become rather complicated .",
    "therefore , instead of dealing with a numerical minimization of the radial part , we employ the strong stabilization mechanism by using a higher order term in the khler potential , @xmath9 the first term is the usual ( minimal ) khler potential .",
    "the constant term is added so that the expectation value of the khler potential approximately vanishes .",
    "the second term is introduced for the purpose of stabilization .",
    "thanks to that term , the radial part is stabilized at @xmath10 and minimizing it .",
    "we assume the potential can be approximated as @xmath11 , and neglect derivatives of the superpotential since they are proportional to the slow - roll parameters .",
    "as expected , the stabilized value of the radial part approaches to @xmath12 as @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 of order one or smaller is sufficient for the truncation to be consistent in the case of @xmath14 .",
    "more general khler potentials with similar features may exist , but we find the above example to be simple and efficient .",
    "our stabilization mechanism is similar to those considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the stabilization parameter @xmath13 in eq .   should be real and positive .",
    "some comments about its magnitude are in order . when @xmath13 becomes large at a fixed @xmath15 , the khler metric ( the coefficient at the kinetic term ) may change its sign before reaching the symmetric phase , @xmath16 .",
    "it occurs when @xmath17 for the khler potential in eq .  .",
    "then the above khler potential should be regarded as the effective description of the higgsed phase around @xmath18 .",
    "it is enough for our purposes , since the radial part is stabilized throughout the process of inflation so we do not have to consider its dynamics .",
    "when using the terms @xmath19 with @xmath20 , also allowed by the symmetry , in eq .  , dynamics of the radial part can not be predicted once its distance from @xmath15 is more than that of the order one .",
    "it may cause the typical problem of initial conditions for inflation .",
    "we just assume here that the radial part is within the order - one distance from @xmath15 at the onset of inflation . ]",
    "conversely , if @xmath13 becomes small at a fixed @xmath15 , the stabilized position of the radial part shifts inwards , @xmath21 , and eventually moves to the origin for @xmath22 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath13 , it is caused either by classical inflaton dynamics , quantum fluctuations , or quantum tunneling .",
    "to avoid such situations , we take the value of @xmath13 to be of at least the same order as that of the critical value @xmath23 .",
    "the stabilization strength can be measured by the mass of the radial part . when @xmath12 , the canonically normalized squared mass of the radial part is given by @xmath24 under the same conditions used for deriving eq .  .",
    "in the last inequality we also assume that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , it is not difficult to strongly stabilize the radial part , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 . as long as the radial component is stabilized with its mass much larger than the hubble scale ,",
    "the considerations in the next sections are independent upon the detailed mechanism of the stabilization .",
    "after inflation , we can not neglect the derivatives of the superpotential , so that eqs .   and are no longer valid .",
    "the model - independent expression for the shift of the radial value from @xmath15 is very complicated , but it vanishes in the limit @xmath28 .",
    "the radial component is not protected by any symmetry , contrary to the phase component .",
    "we expect the mass of the radial component to be of at least the same order as the mass of the phase component . as will be clear in section  [ sec : models ] , susy is generically broken spontaneously .",
    "there is a susy breaking mass contribution @xmath29 near the vacuum , which becomes dominant in the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "thus , the radial part is kept fixed near @xmath15 after inflation for a sufficiently large value of @xmath13 .",
    "having stabilized the radial mode at @xmath30 , let us consider typical inflationary models , without introducing a stabilizer superfield .",
    "let us parametrize the inflaton field as @xmath31 .",
    "the phase is scaled so that it is canonically normalized .",
    "the superpotential breaks the u(1 ) symmetry in the khler potential , and generates the inflaton ( scalar ) potential .",
    "we study chaotic inflation with the quadratic potential , the starobinsky - like plateau potential , and a sinusoidal potential in this section .",
    "the logarithmic singularity in the superpotential is the heart of the helical phase inflation , which is needed to realize a nontrivial spiral shape .",
    "let us take the simplest ansatz @xmath32 where @xmath33 sets the scale of inflation , and @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 and @xmath36 real ) is the dimensional parameter controlling the cosmological constant .",
    "after stabilization , the inflaton potential becomes @xmath37 with @xmath38 thus , the positive quadratic scalar potential is obtained under the condition @xmath39 .",
    "the cosmological constant can be eliminated by choosing @xmath40 the full potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadratic ] for a limited field range . as is clear from the figure ,",
    "the radial part is strongly stabilized , while its mass increases with the potential .",
    "this is also implied by eq .  .    , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the complex scalar is parametrized as @xmath43.,width=400 ]    in this model , susy is not restored after inflation .",
    "the gravitino mass at the vacuum is @xmath44 on the one hand , in the case of @xmath45 , the inflaton becomes much lighter than the gravitino , @xmath46 .",
    "on the other hand , in the large @xmath15 limit , the inequality is reversed , @xmath47 .",
    "the inflationary predictions of the model are well - known , and they do not change in our embedding .",
    "nevertheless , a few comments are in order . by using the observed value of the amplitude of scalar perturbations , @xmath48 ,",
    "the inflaton mass is determined as @xmath49 gev at the @xmath50-foldings @xmath51 .",
    "the gravitino mass is roughly of the same order .",
    "susy breaking is then supposed to be mediated to the mssm sector by the anomaly mediation , and is not compatible with the traditional low - energy susy scenario .",
    "it is the typical consequence of removing a stabilizer field , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the last case ,",
    "susy breaking at the intermediate scale  @xcite can be motivated _",
    "e.g. _ , by noticing that it stabilizes the electro - weak vacuum .",
    "though the quadratic potential is already excluded by planck observations , some modifications or coupling to other sectors may make the quadratic model consistent with the data ( see _ e.g. , _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . instead of studying such possibilities",
    ", we directly construct some viable inflationary models in the next subsections .      in the previous subsection",
    ", the logarithm @xmath52 in the superpotential leads to the quadratic potential .",
    "a plateau - type potential consists of the exponential factors like @xmath53 , so let us consider the exponential of the logarithm , @xmath54 which is equivalent to the imaginary power of the superfield . in other words , let us take the following superpotential : @xmath55 where @xmath33 and @xmath56 are the constant parameters that determine the scale of inflation and the cosmological constant ( see below ) .",

    "there exists a solution of @xmath59 such that @xmath64 is negative and , moreover , the cosmological constant vanishes .",
    "though it is fully straightforward , the solution itself is not very illuminating and , hence , is not shown here .",
