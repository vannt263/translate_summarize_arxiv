    "the renormalization group ( rg ) method has proved one of the most important tools in refined perturbative analysis .",
    "the concept of the rg - improved perturbation theory was originally introduced long ago within the context of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in the landmark work of gell - mann and low @xcite . in the expression of an rg - improved quantity , whether it be the green s function , the effective potential , or any other quantity predictable from feynman diagram perturbation theory , the bare parameters in the corresponding expression are replaced with their scale - dependent running forms which are usually calculated to some given order in the perturbation theory .    in one of the early applications of the rg method , coleman and weinberg@xcite considered the effective potential @xmath10 for a spacetime - independent scalar field @xmath11 in the context of massless models . in the massive case , it has been demonstrated that this treatment also works provided one takes into account a nontrivial running of the vacuum energy @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the earlier work of the present authors @xcite , in which the next - next - to - leading logarithm resummation of the effective potential for a single - component massive @xmath12 theory was obtained , to the next - next - next - to - leading logarithm order . in sec .",
    "ii , without discussing the technical details of how the effective potential is computed , a summary of the @xmath13 three - loop effective potential is given . in sec .",
    "iii , the perturbation solutions for the running parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are obtained , and the result for the next - next - next - to - leading logarithm resummation is reported .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    ", we quote the previous result given in ref .  8 for the next - next - to - leading logarithm resummation of the effective potential .",
    "let us consider a ( single - component ) massive @xmath12 theory defined by the following lagrangian : & = & 12()^2-m^22 ^2-^4-n4!^4- + & & + z2()^2-m^22 ^2 -^4-n4!^4- .",
    "[ lg ] here , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the so - called counterterms of the wave function , mass , coupling constant , and vacuum energy density , respectively .",
    "the three - loop effective potential of this theory was calculated @xcite in the framework of the dimensional regularization @xcite , in which an arbitrary constant , @xmath23 , with mass dimension is introduced inevitably for a dimensional reason . the subtraction done in ref .",
    "9 is nonminimal .",
    "this means that various counterterms of each loop order contain mass - dependent arbitrary finite terms , as well as @xmath24-pole terms .",
    "these finite parts of counterterms are determined by imposing the renormalization conditions on the effective potential at a given renormalization scale .",
    "we stress that the dimensional regularization is perfectly possible _ with _ renormalization conditions ; the renormalized quantities , such as effective potentials or green s functions , would then be identically the same as those found by regularization with a cutoff : they depend only on the renormalization conditions , and not on the regularization procedure .",
    "the calculations of effective potential in ref .  9 and in refs .  11 and 12 are done in the dimensional regularization scheme , with a specific set of renormalization conditions .",
    "the same calculations at a lower - loop level , in the cutoff regularization , with the same renormalization conditions can be found in ref .  13 and ref .  14 , respectively .",
    "we see that the results agree with each other . therefore , in the mass - dependent scheme",
    ", we do not need to calculate finite parts of three - loop diagrams .",
    "knowledge of pole terms is sufficient .",
    "however , in a mass - independent scheme , such as the ms or @xmath1 scheme , we have to calculate three - loop diagrams to the @xmath25 order . without imposing renormalization conditions at a specific scale , we just leave @xmath23 unspecified , as in eq .",
    "( [ v0123 ] ) below .",
    "this has the drawback that it does not involve true physical parameters measured at a given scale .",
    "though it normally takes some effort to express physically measurable quantities in terms of the parameters in the mass - independent scheme , the rg equation in this scheme is dealt with much easier and the calculations in complicated theories are much more convenient .",
    "finite parts , as well as @xmath24-pole parts , of all genuine three - loop integrals  genuine in the sense that they can not be factorized into lower - loop integrals  needed for the computation of the @xmath1 effective potential of the massive @xmath12 theory were calculated _ analytically _ recently @xcite .",
    "once all values of the diagrams needed for the three - loop effective potential are known , the renormalization of the three - loop effective potential is straightforward , albeit long .",
    "thus , we simply summarize the renormalized result : v&=&v^(0)+v^(1)+^2 v^(2)+^3 v^(3)+o(^4 ) , + v^(0)&=&m^2 ^22+^44!+ , + v^(1)&=&(4)^2 , + v^(2)&=&^2(4)^4 , + v^(3)&=&^3(4)^6 , [ v0123 ] where @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 , and the two transcendental numbers @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the clausen s dilogarithm and the generalized log - sine integral respectively , whose numerical values are @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "in the usual loop expansion , the @xmath32-loop quantum correction to the effective potential for a single - component massive @xmath12 theory has the following structure @xcite : v^(l)(, , x , y)=^l+1 ^ 4_m=0^l-1_n=0^l a_lmnx^m-2y^n , [ vl ] where x ,  y.

    "the concept of the leading - logarithm expansion can be explained best by the diagram given in fig .  1 . the coefficients @xmath36 of @xmath37 in fig .",
    "1 are defined as follows : g_n^(l)=(4)^2l^4_m=0^l-1a_lm(l - n)x^m-2 .",
    "the zeroth - to - leading ( i.e. , leading ) logarithm term , @xmath38 , and the first - to - leading ( i.e. , next - to - leading ) logarithm term , @xmath39 , were obtained in ref .",
    "the second - to - leading logarithm ( i.e. , next - next - to leading ) logarithm term , @xmath40 , was obtained in ref .",
    "8 . now in the present paper , we calculate the third - to - leading , i.e. , next - next - next - to - leading , logarithm term , @xmath41 . in order to obtain a renormalization - group - improved effective potential which is exact up to @xmath42th - to - leading logarithm order , we need @xmath43-loop rg functions together with the @xmath42-loop effective potential @xcite . the various @xmath44 and @xmath45 functions ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 )",
