    "although this asymmetry is thought to be related to gould s belt , there is no evidence of the same asymmetry in low galactic latitude snrs , which should not be statistically different @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified several snr candidates at high galactic latitude based principally on morphology at 4.85 ghz @xcite and the absence of 60-@xmath5 m far - infrared emission , which is a strong discriminant against thermal sources .",
    "one of the most intriguing candidates found was g332.55.6 , a region with three patches of filamentary emission and a total size of about @xmath6 , that does not appear at all like a canonical snr ( a filamentary shell or a centrally - peaked source ) .",
    "the unusual appearance of this source meant a more comprehensive study would be needed , with spectral index and polarization measurements , to confirm the identification .",

    "in this paper we present high resolution observations of g332.55.6 carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at two frequencies , 1384 mhz and 2432 mhz , including full stokes parameters at the higher frequency .",

    "the first run was on january 11 2003 over 12 hours , with the array in the 1.5b configuration ( baselines varying from 30.6 to 1286  m ) , using the correlator configuration of two 128 mhz bands ( over 32 channels ) centered at 1384 mhz and 1704 mhz . because of the large angular size of the source ,",
    "observations were made in mosaicing mode with three pointings to completely cover the extended radio emission . to optimize the sampling according to the nyquist theorem ,",
    "the pointings were separated by @xmath8 .",
    "the remaining two sessions were conducted on april 12 and 23 2003 , for 5 hours each day , with the atca in the ew 352 configuration ( baselines from 30.6 to 352 m ) .",
    "the two continuum bands were centered this time on 1384 mhz and 2496 mhz in the first session , and 1384 mhz and 2368 mhz in the second session , to avoid likely interference .",
    "the largest angular scales sampled by these datasets are @xmath9 and @xmath10 at 20 cm and 13 cm respectively . the primary beam is smaller at 13 cm , so the observed mosaic consisted of 4 pointings separated by @xmath11 from one another .",
    "unfortunately , both these runs were substantially overlapped in hour angle , so the resulting synthesized beam is rather elongated .",
    "the source pks 165756 was used to calibrate phase , while pks 1934638 was used for flux density and bandpass calibration .",
    "the data were processed with the miriad software package @xcite . to construct the image at 20 cm , all pointings at 1384 mhz and 1704 mhz",
    "were merged together in the @xmath12plane .",
    "the image was constructed with a cell size of @xmath13 and uniform weighting which minimizes the sidelobe levels .",
    "a gaussian taper was applied to the visibility data by setting the _ fwhm _ parameter equal to 24 arcsec in the miriad task invert .    to deconvolve a dirty mosaic image ,",
    "two miriad routines can be used : mosmem and mossdi . according to the miriad user s guide ,",
    "the former is generally superior , except for images containing point sources .",
    "therefore , the deconvolution was performed in two steps : firstly , point sources were cleaned using mossdi , and then mosmem was used for the residual image .",
    "the synthesised beam was @xmath14 , with a position angle ( measured clockwise from north ) of @xmath15 .",
    "however , to improve the signal to noise ratio , the image was smoothed to a @xmath16 beam .    due to the strong artifacts introduced by the bright compact source pmn j16435418 , close to the western edge of the n - e filament of g332.55.6",

    "most of the small - scale structure observed in the 20 cm image is also found in the sumss image , including the central component , although some of the smooth emission has been resolved out .",

    ".,width=302,height=340 ]      the average fractional polarization of g332.55.6 at 13 cm is @xmath31% .",
    "there is little variation over the face of the snr .",
    "the polarization level is rather high but @xcite also found high percentages of polarization in g326.31.8 using the atca , and they discuss how the polarization might be artificially increased in aperture synthesis observations .",
    "this occurs because the polarized intensity probably has more fine structure than the total intensity and the absence of short spacings resolves out some of the total intensity emission .",
    "the compact source pmn j16435418 was found to be unpolarized .          to obtain the spectral index of g332.55.6 , we used a standard flux - flux plotting technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method compares the point by point flux densities of two images at different frequencies which have been constructed from datasets with the same @xmath32 range .",
    "the slope of a linear regression is then used to compute the spectral index , independently of possible differences in the zero level of each image .",
    "the resolution limit of the filtered maps is determined by the 13 cm observations .",
    "the visibilities of the two datasets overlap between 0.3 and 1.47 k@xmath33 . using only @xmath32 data within this range ,",
    "two images were constructed following the same procedure as described in section 2 .",
    "the resulting beam was @xmath34 , with a position angle of @xmath22 .",
    "flux - flux plots were constructed for the three filaments separately . in all cases ,",
    "the point sources were excluded except for source number 4 in table 1 , which was not resolved in the filtered maps .",
    "however , since this is a faint source , the result is not expected to be markedly different .",
    "in fact , the s - w filament shows the best correlation . for the other two components , the correlation was poor ( just above 0.8 ) .",
    "the flux - flux plots are shown in figure  [ fluxfluxplot ] .",
    "for correlations very close to one , the slope of the linear fit is independent of which of the two frequencies is taken to be the abscissa . in general , this is not true .",
    "therefore it is necessary to compute two different slopes with each frequency being alternately the abscissa .",
    "the spectral indices obtained using the average of both slopes are @xmath35 for the n - e filament , @xmath36 for the central one , and @xmath37 for the s - w filament , where the errors enclose the values obtained for the two different slopes .",
    "the poorest correlation is found for the central filament .",
    "the departures from a straight line may indicate that regions with different spectral indices , and hence electron populations with different acceleration mechanisms , are coexisting .",
    "the regions used in the flux density calculations were varied for a range of cutoff levels , to establish a measure of the uncertainty in the estimates .",

    "pointings are not expected to be optimal . however , since g332.55.6 is about twice as large as the parkes beam , it is likely that the profiles used are substantially independent . in spite of some drifts in the zero level due to uncertainties in the method",

    "two of them , near 0 , are related to local gas , and the broader one includes a secondary minimum at about @xmath41  corresponding to the sagittarius arm ( * ? ? ? * with r@xmath42 kpc ) .",
    "the emission excess at 0  can be explained as background   from the far side of the scutum - crux arm .",
    "the third absorption feature is centred at approximately @xmath43 , with a fwhm of  7 , and represents the near side of the scutum - crux arm .",
    "adopting a lower limit of @xmath44  for the systemic velocity of the snr ( allowing for the width of the 45  feature ) , the galactic rotation model of @xcite produces distances of 3.4 and 12 kpc .",
    "the emission excess at the tangent point , near @xmath45 , resolves the ambiguity in favor of the closer distance .",

    "all velocities are referred to the lsr . ]    to confirm our absorption result , it would be useful to observe this source with the atca in the  21 cm line , since interferometers filter extended emission and thus the absorption profile is directly observed .",
    "in addition , the high angular resolution that can be achieved with the atca will distinguish between absorption from g332.55.6 and that produced by the brighter compact source pmn j16435418 . at present ,",

    "we have smoothed the image with a @xmath49 gaussian . in figure [ rosat ]",
    "we show the x - ray emission in the direction of the snr with radio contours at 20 cm overlaid .",
    "contours of the snr at 20 cm are overlaid.,width=8,height=8 ]    there is strong x - ray emission coming from the center of the remnant , while no significant x - ray emission is found at the outer filaments except for a small source in the northern filament , in the center of two radio peaks .",
    "this source is catalogued as j164422.2542221 in the second rosat pspc catalog .",
    "however , the association between this x - ray source and the snr is uncertain .",
    "the central component and the x - ray emission are morphologically very similar .",
    "there is a weak finger in x - rays extending approximately @xmath50 to the se beyond the radio outermost contour .",
    "the pspc image covers the frequency range from 0.1 to 2.4 kev . from the rosat",
    "all sky survey ( rass3 ) images , it is clear that most of the x - ray emission arises in the frequency range from 0.5 to 2.4 kev , while the emission between 0.1 and 0.5 kev is negligible .    the central component does not have a flat spectral index , compared with the two outer filaments , which would be characteristic of recent energy injection .",
    "hence , our result does not support a model where the central x - ray emission is associated with a nebula driven by the winds of a central pulsar , a `` pulsar wind nebula '' ( pwn ) , which is characterized by flat spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    however , as noted in section 3.2 , the poor correlation between the emission at 13 and 20 cm for the central component may imply that different electron populations on smaller scales are coexisting , and thus a pwn can not be definitely ruled out . to investigate this possibility , we searched the atnf pulsar catalogue @xcite .",
    "no pulsars were found in the vicinity of g332.55.6 .",
    "hence , we believe that the central x - ray emission is produced by an alternative mechanism , such as cloud evaporation in the hot snr interior @xcite or by thermal conduction , when the shell becomes radiative and only the hot interior persists in x - ray ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an improved rosat x - rays image which may help to discriminate between the different scenarios is presented by @xcite .",
    "additionally , since the parkes multibeam pulsar survey only extends to @xmath51 , a search for a pulsar towards g332.55.6 should be pursued .",
    "the morphology of g332.55.6 and its linear size of @xmath52 pc , estimated for a distance of 3.4 kpc , indicates a more evolved snr .",
    "the source resembles bilateral snrs , like g350.002.0 and vro 42.05.01 .",
    "this class of snrs is characterised by a clear axis of symmetry with two bright limbs and occasionally low levels of emission along the axis @xcite .",
    "several explanations have been proposed to account for such morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most plausible appears to be that these remnants are expanding into elongated cavities in the interstellar medium , which may have been created by the ambient magnetic field @xcite .    in general",
    ", the symmetry axes of bilateral snrs are oriented nearly parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "the axis of g332.55.6 , on the contrary , is almost perpendicular to this direction .",
    "the same `` anomalous '' orientation is seen in the two bilateral snrs : g296.5 + 10.0 and g327.6 + 14.6 ( sn 1006 ) .",
    "these two remnants are also exceptional in their height above the galactic plane . using the distance estimated by @xcite based on  observations , g296.5 + 10.0 lies @xmath53 pc above the galactic disk , while sn 1006 has a height of @xmath54 pc based on the distance derived by @xcite combining proper motions of optical filaments and radial velocities .",
    "at a distance of 3.4 kpc , g332.55.6 would be located at a height of 330 pc above the plane .",
    "@xcite explains the orientation in these cases as due to perpendicular structures such as chimneys and `` worms '' , which occur frequently at high galactic latitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution between about @xmath43 and 50 , which encompasses the systemic velocity of the remnant , shows a protrusion of enhanced density that extends from the galactic plane to the halo .",
    "the n - e filament of the snr appears roughly aligned , near this protrusion .",
    "figure [ himap ] shows the average  emission within 10  around @xmath55 , where the density enhancement is well defined .",
    "it is not clear whether the match between the n - e filament and the  emission is due to absorption effects or to a physical interaction between the snr shock front and the ism .",
    "there is no evidence of an association between the s - w filament and the  gas .",
    "in fact , rather than a bilateral snr , g332.55.6 resembles a trident like g291.00.1 @xcite .",
    "both snrs are composed of three roughly parallel ridges , perpendicular to the galactic disk , and both have a bright x - ray core coincident with the central radio component . for g291.00.1 this central region is a pwn @xcite and there is also a circular region of fainter emission .",
    "however , for g332.55.6 , which has a larger angular size , there is no indication of extended underlying emission although a smooth component could have been filtered out because interferometry was used for the observations .",
    "single dish measurements will be needed to address this question .",
    "another difference between these two snrs is that for g291.00.1 , the central component is more intense and extended than the outer filaments , while for g332.55.6 all three components are roughly equal in size and intensity .",
    "although the outer filaments may be part of a shell structure , @xcite propose that all the components of g291.00.1 are subsidiary peaks of a filled - centre snr .",
    "nevertheless , we believe despite the differences described , the morphological radio and x - rays coincidences between these remnants are so striking that they may well be members of a new , trident - shaped , subclass of composite snrs .",
    "we have observed the radio source g332.55.6 with the atca at two radio continuum frequencies , 1384 mhz and 2432 mhz .",
    "our observations confirm that this source is a snr . on average ,",
    "the emission from the source is about 35% polarized . using these two frequencies , the global spectral index for the snr",
    "was found to be @xmath0 .",
    "all of the three main components of the snr have essentially the same spectral characteristics .",
    "however , the departures from a linear correlation in the flux - flux plots for the central filament indicate that probably more than one population of electrons is present .",
    "therefore , the existence of a pulsar wind driven nebula can not be ruled out at this stage .",
    "the central component is coincident with extended x - ray emission .",
    "a more detailed spectral study of this x - ray component would be helpful in determining the origin of this emission .",
    "we have used  archival data to analyze the absorption spectrum towards this source . based on this spectrum",
    ", we found that the distance to the snr is @xmath2 kpc . at this distance ,",
    "the height above the galactic disk is 330 pc .    from its peculiar radio and x - ray morphology ,",
    "g332.5 - 5.6 should be classified as a composite snr , and we suggest that it belongs to a trident - shaped subclass with g291.00.1 .",
    "the orientation of the three components is perpendicular to the galactic plane , similar to that found for the bilateral snrs g296.5 + 10.0 and sn 1006 , which also lie well above the galactic plane ( heights @xmath56 pc ) .",
    "this orientation could be related to chimneys and `` worms '' in the halo .",
    "we found an  feature extending towards the halo at a distance of 3.4 kpc ( systemic velocity of @xmath57 ) which appears aligned with the snr , but the evidence for an association is weak .",
