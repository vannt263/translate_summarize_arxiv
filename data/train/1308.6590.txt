    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are the oldest known stellar systems and their study has contributed fundamental knowledge to our understanding of stellar evolution and galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet their origin remains poorly understood .",
    "the discovery of multiple stellar populations with a range of chemical compositions in milky way ( mw ) gcs revolutionized our understanding of gc formation , as these systems were previously believed to form in a single rapid star formation event .",
    "several scenarios were proposed to explain the observed complexities of the stellar populations in gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but all fail to match all the observations of galactic gcs . in common to most models is the following triad of features : 1 ) gcs underwent internal chemical evolution ; 2 ) more massive gcs self - enriched more efficiently due to an increased ability to hold on to enriched gas for subsequent star formation ; and 3 ) gcs have lost _ most _ of their primordial mass .",
    "it is difficult to use resolved observations of galactic gcs to submit the above predictions to quantitative scrutiny , as this requires the determination of detailed abundance patterns for statistically significant samples of individual gc stars spanning a wide range of gc masses .",
    "such determinations are very costly , as they rely on high - resolution spectroscopy based on 8 - 10  m telescopes .",
    "integrated spectroscopy can provide important supplementary information to constrain models , in the form of mean abundances of elements such as nitrogen , which indicate the presence of self - enrichment in gcs . based on a sample of 72 old gcs belonging to the andromeda ( m31 ) galaxy",
    "we study the correlations between gc mass and the mean abundances of fe , mg , c , n , and ca . for the first time , we find evidence for the presence of a correlation between gc mass and the mean abundance of nitrogen .",
    "this result challenges the notion that gcs have lost most of their masses since formation , and may help constrain the source of chemical enrichment in these systems .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows : the data are described in section  [ data ] , the results are presented in section  [ results ] , and our conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the m31 gc spectra employed in this analysis @xcite were obtained with the mmt / hectospec spectrograph , at mount hopkins , arizona , whereas the spectra of mw gcs were collected with the boller & chivens spectrograph attached to the blanco 4  m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory @xcite .",
    "absorption line indices , measured in the lick system , as well as internal and systematic uncertainties , are discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "lick index measurements are converted into abundance and age estimates , along with associated uncertainties , using the ez_ages code @xcite , which implements a method developed by @xcite . for more details on abundance error estimates , including extensive monte carlo simulations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "nitrogen abundances are based on the cn@xmath0 and/or cn@xmath1 indices , and because the cn band measured by these indices is too weak to be detected in our medium resolution integrated spectra of gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 1.0 @xcite , only gcs more metal - rich than that limit are considered .",
    "thus , our initial sample includes 175 gcs with iron abundance within the range 1.0 @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 + 0.2 .",
    "the sample is further restricted to gcs for which our spectra have s / n@xmath4100/@xmath5 , for which our abundances , particularly for nitrogen , are most reliable",
    ". the final sub - sample of 72 gcs spans masses between 10@xmath6 and 10@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that m31 gcs are about as old as their mw couterparts , thus the two gc systems can be compared on the same footing .",
    "mass is a key parameter in our analysis , and we note that elemental abundances and masses are based on independent data and methods . within the sample of 72 gcs studied in this _ letter _",
    ", dynamical masses ( @xmath9 ) from @xcite are available for 53 objects and , for the remaining gcs , photometric masses ( @xmath10 ) are adopted , estimated assuming @xmath11 and m / l@xmath12=1.5 or m / l@xmath13=0.8 , depending on available photometry .",
    "masses for mw gcs were taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we next check for the presence of systematic effects on @xmath10 due to the impact of age and/or chemical composition on mass - to - light ratios . in figures",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , v band- and k band - based @xmath10s are compared with @xmath9 as a function of @xmath9 and [ fe / h ] , for a larger gc sample from @xcite .",
    "both sets of photometric masses are in good agreement with @xmath9 and in figure  [ fig1 ] the residuals show at most a very slight correlation with gc mass , which is negligible for the purposes of this _",
    "letter_. in figure  [ fig2 ] a trend can be seen with [ fe / h ] , particularly in the case of k band - based photometric masses .",
    "the effect is very small , however , especially considering the [ fe / h ] range of the sample ( @xmath14 } \\leq + 0.2 $ ] ) , and the fact that photometric masses were adopted for only @xmath151/4 of those gcs .",
    "therefore , systematics on the k band - based photometric masses is at most of the order of 0.2 dex , and half of that in the case of v band - based masses .",
    "considering the dynamic range ( in mass ) of our correlations , this effect is negligible .",
    "in fact , the statistics on the correlations studied in this _",
    "letter _ is unaffected regardless of whether we employ only v - band or k - band photometric masses .",
    "we conclude that our analysis incurs no important systematic effects due to the adoption of photometric masses for part of the sample . for an in depth discussion of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ,",
    "see @xcite .        .",
    "photometric masses are slightly smaller at higher [ fe / h ] , but the effect is negligible . ]",
    "resulting [ fe / h ] and abundance ratios ( [ x / fe ] ) are plotted as a function of gc mass in figure  [ fig3 ] , where gcs are color coded according to [ fe / h ] .",
    "squares ( open stars ) represent data for m31 ( mw ) gcs .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient ( @xmath16 ) and the probability associated with the null hypothesis ( p ) for a correlation between data pairs are shown in the upper left corner of each panel .",
    "the only quantity correlating significantly with gc mass is [ n / fe ] ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "we note that [ n / fe ] correlates even more strongly with gc absolute magnitude , m@xmath12 , which is a more directly measurable quantity , more reliable than mass ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , not shown ) .",
    "the numbers suggest the presence of a weak anti - correlation between [ c / fe ] and mass , although that is not confirmed by visual inspection of the data .    most of the scatter in the [ n / fe]-mass relation is due to a ( stronger ) correlation between [ n / fe ] and [ fe / h ] , which can be perceived in figure  [ fig3 ] , where higher [ fe / h ] gcs have systematically higher [ n / fe ] at fixed mass . a similar ,",
    "although steeper , correlation was found in early - type galaxies @xcite , which was confirmed independently by @xcite .",
    "no such correlation can be seen in solar neighborhood field star data compiled by @xcite , although this may be due to inhomogeneous abundance data . because gcs in the high [ fe / h ] bin span a limited mass range , they only contribute vertical scatter to the [ n / fe]-mass relation at 5.5@xmath216.0 , leading to a spurious degradation of the correlation .",
    "therefore , an accurate assessment of the [ n / fe]-mass correlation requires restricting the sample to gcs with 1.0 @xmath22 [ fe / h ] @xmath22",
    "-0.4 ( 61 gcs ) , as shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the statistical significance of the [ n / fe]-mass ( [ n / fe]-m@xmath12 ) increases in this case , with @xmath16=0.49 ( @xmath16=0.51 ) . figure  [ fig4 ] also shows linear fits to the relations of [ n / fe ] with mass and [ fe / h ] for m31 gcs ( left panels ) .",
    "the residuals from the [ n / fe]mass relation correlate with [ fe / h ] ( upper right ) , whereas those from the [ n / fe][fe / h ] relation correlate with mass ( lower right ) , providing additional evidence to the presence of a [ n / fe]-mass relation .    for a small sample of galactic gcs ,",
    "abundance studies of main sequence stars show a large spread in [ n / fe ] and [ c / fe ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the atmospheres of dwarf stars are not affected by internal mixing from evolutionary effects , this spread is usually interpreted as resulting from chemical evolution within the gcs stellar populations , with the first generation stars having an abundance pattern similar to that of field populations of same [ fe / h ] , and stars formed subsequently being enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon .",
    "while observational challenges prevent abundance measurements in individual m31 gc stars , they are likely to be present there as well , thus our abundance ratio measurements should be interpreted as _",
    "mean _ values .",
    "evidence from mw gcs suggests that second generation stars represent a significant , approximately constant , fraction of gc masses today ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore mean abundances based on integrated light spectroscopy provide a reliable indication of the amount of chemical enrichment undergone by gcs .",
    "thus , the correlation between gc mass and mean [ n / fe ] is evidence for the occurence of a feedback - regulated history of star formation and chemical enrichment in gcs .",
    "a somewhat loose correlation between gc absolute magnitude and the range of [ o / na ] in gc stars in a smaller sample of mw gcs was found before @xcite . however , the correlation presented in this _ letter _ is more robust , based on a larger sample , and for the first time for nitrogen , which is difficult to measure in large samples of individual stars .",
    "average formal uncertainties in abundances ( lower right corner of each panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) are small , but zero point uncertainties may be larger .",
    "systematic effects may affect [ n / fe ] values , especially for [ n / fe ] @xmath23 + 0.3 , where they rely on extrapolations of the cn@xmath0 index sensitivity calculations @xcite .",
    "further uncertainties stem from [ n / fe ] being derived from the strengths of cn bands , which are also sensitive to [ c / fe ] , although the latter are well constrained by modeling of the c@xmath14668 index .",
    "most importantly , although model uncertainties may render the absolute values of [ n / fe ] in figure  [ fig3 ] somewhat uncertain , the correlation between [ n / fe ] and gc mass seems robust .",
    "a substantial expansion of the data on [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] towards large samples of individual mw gc stars would help validate the existence of this trend and uncover its origin .     and",
    "gc mass ( bottom right panel ) , which is consistent with the presence of self - enrichment in m31 gcs .",
    "the correlation is more obvious at fixed [ fe / h ] , due to a concurrent correlation between [ n / fe ] and [ fe / h ] ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the absence of a correlation in heavy elements such as fe , mg , and ca indicates that n enrichment can not be caused by explosive nucleosynthesis .",
    "the numbers suggest the presence of a weak anti - correlation between [ c / fe ] and mass , which is not confirmed by visual inspection of the data . ]     and gc mass ( top , repeated from figure  [ fig3 ] ) and [ fe / h ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the right panels plot the residuals from each of these fits as a function of mass ( bottom ) and [ fe / h ] .",
    "symbols as in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    ". the residuals from the fit to the [ n / fe]mass relation correlate with [ fe / h ] .",
    "conversely , the residuals from the [ n / fe][fe / h ] relation correlate with mass .",
    "the correlation between mass and the residuals from the [ n / fe][fe / h ] relation provides further evidence for the presence of self - enrichment in gcs . on the other hand , the correlation between the residuals from the [ n / fe]mass relation and [ fe / h ] accounts for most of the large scatter in that relation .",
    "the correlation between [ n / fe ] and [ fe / h ] argues for the presence of secondary n - enrichment , which may help constrain the source of chemical enrichment in gcs . ]",
    "additional , model independent , evidence comes from correlations between line indices and gc mass .",
    "the correlations are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , where selected line indices are plotted against gc mass , for the same sample from figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "we find statistically significant correlations between gc mass and cn indices , including lick cn@xmath0 ( and cn@xmath1 , not shown ) and cn3883 @xcite .",
    "the cn bands are sensitive to the abundances of nitrogen and carbon , but since there is no correlation between c@xmath24 and gc mass , one concludes that the correlations are driven by nitrogen . a statistically significant correlation is also found between gc mass and the nad index , which is sensitive to sodium abundance  the elemental abundance whose variations constitute most of the evidence for self - enrichment in galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of correlations between mass and indices such as @xmath25 and mg @xmath26 ( not shown ) , which are mostly sensitive to the abundances of iron and magnesium , respectively , further corroborates our conclusion that only the abundances of specific elements , such as nitrogen , and possibly sodium , correlate with gc mass .",
    "the correlations between gc mass and line indices are unsurprisingly noisier than that between [ n / fe ] and gc mass , since line indices are not uniquely determined by the abundance of the target elements , being also affected by other parameters , such as age , metallicity , hb morphology , and other elemental abundances .",
    "the strength of the correlation is weakest for cn3883 index , for unclear reasons , which may be associated with lower s / n blueward of 4000 @xmath5 and possibly the influence of a spread in horizontal branch morphology at fixed chemical composition and age .",
    "the latter effect should impact more strongly the violet cn3883 index than its counterpart at 4170 @xmath5 .",
    "correlations between cluster mass and mean abundances of n and ( possibly ) na have the following implications for our understanding of the formation of gcs and the mw halo .",
    "first , they are consistent with the occurrence of a feedback - regulated history of star formation and chemical enrichment in m31 gcs .",
    "one would thus expect that the correlation breaks down at some low mass limit , below which the gravitational potential would be too shallow to retain chemically enriched ejecta .",
    "no such effect is detected , which may be due to the relatively high low - mass limit of our high s / n sample , m  @xmath27  10@xmath6m@xmath28 , which is higher than the low mass threshold for gc self - enrichment in m31 , @xmath1510@xmath29m@xmath28 , proposed by @xcite on the basis of modeling of pressura balance in intracluster gas in the early galaxy environment .",
    "better data are required for lower mass old gcs , to test that prediction .",
    "second , many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposed that mw gcs were as much as 10 - 100 times more massive in the past , with most of their stellar masses being lost through two - body relaxation and tidal stripping during interactions with the galactic gravitational potential .",
    "the discovery of cn - strong stars in the mw halo field led to the suggestion that a substantial fraction of the stellar halo results from gc dissolution @xcite .",
    "however , one intuitively expects that copious mass loss erase pre - existing correlations between chemistry and mass , unless , on the one hand , most mass loss happened _ before _ the bulk of internal chemical evolution took place in gcs or , on the other , mass loss physics establishes a smooth relation between primordial and current gc masses .",
    "on the one hand , numerical simulations by @xcite show that most stellar mass loss takes place over timescales of @xmath30  yr , which implies higher stellar age spreads than allowed by observations of turnoff stars in both mw and lmc gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , simulations suggest that mass loss is proportional to a power of cluster mass @xcite , so that mass loss should preserve a pre - existing mass - chemical composition relation , provided it depends more strongly on gc mass than on other variables such as orbital characteristics and environment .",
    "yet the latter dependencies may be important enough to account for the observed scatter in the [ n / fe]-mass relation .",
    "third , our results help constrain the nature of stars responsible for chemical enrichment in gcs .",
    "four mechanisms have been proposed : winds from intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rapidly rotating massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mass - transfer binary massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and explosive nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* only for the most massive gcs ) .",
    "the correlation between [ n / fe ] and mass , and the absence of correlations for by - products of explosive nucleosynthesis , such as mg ( and ca , not shown ) suggests that the enrichment of the intracluster medium was caused by low energy ejecta . to first order",
    ", the velocity of retained stellar ejecta should be comparable to typical gc escape velocities , which range between a few and @xmath15 100 _ km s@xmath31 _ @xcite .",
    "this is in relatively good agreement with typical wind velocities of agb stars @xcite and interacting - binary winds @xcite .",
    "likewise , these escape velocities rule out winds from massive stars , with typical velocities of order 10@xmath32 km s@xmath31 @xcite , although physical mechanisms such as wind - wind interactions in binary systems @xcite and slow winds from fast - rotating massive stars @xcite were proposed to address this tension . while our results for fe , mg , and ca rule out enrichment by explosive nucleosynthesis it is conceivable that it plays a role in the most massive gcs in m31 , since the theoretical expectation is for supernovae ejecta to be retained by clusters with m  @xmath33  m@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "those clusters are the analogs of massive mw gcs , such as @xmath34 cen and m  54 , whose stellar populations present a range of [ fe / h ] @xcite .",
    "the existence of a correlation between [ n / fe ] and [ fe / h ] is interesting .",
    "@xcite also suggest the existence of a correlation between the amount of cluster self - enrichment ( in al ) and a combination of [ fe / h ] and m@xmath12 .",
    "there is no evidence for a correlation between [ n / fe ] and [ fe / h ] in galactic field stars , suggesting that it is an imprint of gc chemical evolution .",
    "this may be a clue to the source of chemical enrichment in these systems , possibly indicating the presence of secondary n enrichment .     and [ fig4 ] .",
    "statistically significant correlations are found for indices sensitive to the abundances of nitrogen ( cn@xmath0 and cn3883 ) and sodium ( nad ) , whereas indices mainly sensitive to age ( @xmath35 ) or the abundances of iron ( @xmath25 ) and carbon ( @xmath36 ) do not correlate with mass .",
    "cluster mass correlate more weakly with line indices than with abundance ratios because the former are sensitive to other parameters , such as age , metallicity , and horizontal - branch morphology ( especially in the case of cn3883 ) .",
    "these plots corroborate our conclusion that gcs are self enriched in light elements , but not in by - produts of explosive nucleosynthesis . ]    finally , from chemical evolution models based on enrichment from material processed through hot bottom burning in massive agb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one would expect the [ n / fe]-mass correlation to be accompanied by a [ c / fe]-mass anti - correlation .",
    "statistics suggests the possible presence of a weak anti - correlation ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , but that is not confirmed by visual inspection of the data .",
    "however , the variation in mean [ c / fe ] may be small enough that it would require more accurate data for its detection .",
    "the existence of a mass - chemical composition relation is a strong clue to the chemical evolution history of gcs , which can constrain gc formation theory .",
    "the data discussed here provide a proving ground to test _ quantitative _ model predictions , including a chemical evolution prescription based on state - of - the - art yields and a star formation history grounded on a realistic account of the physical conditions prevailing in primordial clusters .",
