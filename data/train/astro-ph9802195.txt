    "we aim to estimate the effects of the the induced raman scattering of the strong electromagnetic wave propagating in pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "raman scattering may be considered as a parametric decay of the initial transverse electromagnetic wave in the another electromagnetic wave and plasma wave .",
    "the probability of this process is greatly enhanced if there many waves present in the final states .",
    "this is induced raman scattering .",
    "another type of induced scattering - induced brullion scattering , i.e. the decay of the initial transverse electromagnetic wave in the another electromagnetic wave and ion sound is prohibited in electron - positron plasma , since pair plasma does not support low frequency , density perturbing waves ( like ion sound wave in electron - ion plasma ) .",
    "strong nonlinear coupling occurs when two waves beat together and the sum or difference frequency and wavelength match the frequency and wavelength of the third wave : @xmath0 in quantum language these relations may be interpreted as conservation of energy and momentum along the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "( the transverse components of the momentum are not conserved ) .",
    "the probability of the induced scattering depends on the number of waves in the final state , which , in turn , depends on the damping or escape rate of the daughter waves .",
    "the energy transfer between the modes will be efficient if the energy of the pump wave is strong enough to overcome the damping losses or escape of the generated waves .",
    "thus , the induced raman scattering is a threshold process : if the intensity of the pump wave exceeds the threshold value , the initial electromagnetic wave would start converting energy into the decay waves decreasing its amplitude exponentially .",
    "induced raman scattering may be important in the pulsar environment in two ways .",
    "first , it may provide en effective damping of the existing electromagnetic wave , that has been generated by some emission mechanism at the lower altitude in the pulsar magnetosphere , where the resonant conditions for the induced raman scattering were not satisfied .",
    "this may result in a short time variability which is generally observed in pulsar radio emission .",
    "secondly , it may provide an effective saturation mechanism for the growth of the electromagnetic wave provided that the conditions for the wave excitation by some mechanism are satisfied in the region where an effective raman scattering takes place .",
    "the first possibility , i.e. the scattering of the existent wave , is simpler to consider . as a first approximation , we can treat the intensity of the pump wave as a constant .",
    "then the nonlinear equations describing the wave coupling become linear in amplitudes of the decayed waves .",
    "the exponentially growing solutions will imply an effective energy transfer from the pump wave .",
    "as the intensities of the decay waves grow , this approximation breaks down in two cases : when the amplitudes of the decay waves become comparable to the pump wave or when the amplitude of the decay waves enter nonlinear stage and the waves start loosing energy due to some nonlinear process ( like particle trapping and acceleration ) .",
    "the net effect of any energy loss by the decay wave is the depletion of the original pump wave . for the practical estimates",
    ", we can neglect the nonlinear stages of evolution ( like cyclic energy transfer between the pump and the daughter waves ) and assume that if the intensity of the pump wave begins to decrease exponentially in the linear stage , then the wave decays completely .    the second possibility , e.g. when the induced raman scattering provides a nonlinear saturation mechanism , is more complicated , since the intensities of all waves may be of the same order .",
    "a considerable simplification in this case may be obtained if the damping of one of the decay modes is very strong or if it leaves the region of the resonant interaction fast enough .",
    "then , after a short period of time ( when the intensities of the other weakly damped waves grow considerably ) the intensity of this damped mode is much smaller than the intensities of the two other modes and can be neglected .    in what follows",
    "we neglect the possible nonlinear stages of the development of langmuir turbulence ( particle trapping or quasilinear diffusion ) .",
    "we also assume that the pump wave is broadband .",
    "this is quite different from the conventional laboratory case of a monochromatic laser - plasma interaction .",
    "the condition of a broadband pump wave implies that its band width @xmath1 is much larger than the typical growth rate of the decay instability @xmath2 : @xmath3 if this condition is satisfied , then we can use a random phase approximation for the statistical description of the interacting waves . on the other hand",
    ", the condition of weak turbulence allows one to calculate the matrix elements of the interaction in the approximation of stationary phases .    the general expression for the third order nonlinear current in plasma in a magnetic field has been written down by @xcite . an extremely complicated form of the corresponding expressions makes the general case of raman scattering very difficult to consider .",
    "several important simplifications can be done when considering induced raman scattering in the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "first , the superstrong magnetic field allows an expansion of the currents in @xmath4 .",
    "second , in the pair plasma with the same distributions of electrons and positrons some of the nonlinear currents cancel out since they are proportional to the third power of the electric charge ( this cancellation is exact in the unmagnetized electron - positron plasma ) .",
    "the third , less justified approximation , is that we will make is that all the three interacting waves propagate along magnetic field .",
    "this is an important assumption .",
    "it allows us to simplify the consideration considerably and to obtain some analytical estimates of the effects of induced raman scattering .    a short overview of the work on the nonlinear process in the pulsar magnetosphere will be appropriate here .",
    "the possible decay processes for the transverse waves and the corresponding references are ( @xmath5 denotes transverse wave , @xmath6 denotes longitudinal wave and @xmath7 denotes a charged particle ) : ( i ) a decay of a transverse wave into two transverse wave @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , ( ii ) a decay of a transverse wave into two lagmiur waves @xmath9 ( @xcite ) , ( iii ) a decay of a transverse wave into another transverse and lagmuir wave @xmath10 ( @xcite ) ( iv ) induced scattering of transverse waves @xmath11 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "when treating the nonlinear process involving transverse waves , the matrix elements in above works have been calculated in the drift approximation - the expansion in parameter @xmath4 was done in the very beginning ( @xmath15 is magnetic field , @xmath16 is mass of an electron and @xmath17 is the speed of light ) .",
    "normal modes of relativistic pair plasma for the case of parallel propagation consist of two transverse waves with the dispersion relation @xmath18 and a plasma langmuir wave with a dispersion relation @xmath19 where in eq .",
    "( [ lliafs3 ] ) the wave vectors should not be much larger than cross - over point : @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have introduced here a plasma frequency in the plasma frame @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the pulsar rotation angular velocity , @xmath23 is the multiplicity factor , @xmath24 is the lorentz factor of the plasma frame , @xmath25 is lorentz invariant temperature of plasma , @xmath26 is lorentz factor of a particle and @xmath27 is a characteristic ( dimensionless ) thermal velocity of particles , @xmath28 is ( dimensionless ) velocity .",
    "the brackets denote averaging over the distribution function .    at the point",
    "@xmath29 the dispersion curve of plasma waves intersect that of waves in vacuum , so that for @xmath30 the plasma waves become subluminous .",
    "the necessary requirement for that is that the distribution function falls fast enough at large values of momentum ( faster than @xmath31 ) ( @xcite ) .    in the subluminous region ,",
    "the plasma wave dispersion relation may be written as @xmath32        induced raman scattering is closely related to the induced compton scattering of waves by the plasma particles . in the conventional treatment of induced compton scattering in pulsar setting ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) the collective effects of the plasma are ignored . in the case of",
    "induced raman scattering collective effects play a major role .",
    "raman scattering is a limit of the induced compton scattering of waves by particles in a medium when the beat wave of the incoming and scattered wave becomes a normal mode of the medium ( equivalently , it falls on the `` mass surface '' of the medium dispersion equation ) .    in the nonrelativistic plasma the collective treatment of the wave scattering by plasma particles",
    "is justified if the following condition is true : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the change in the wave number of the scattered wave and @xmath42 is the debye length . condition ( [ n3 ] ) states that the wave number of the oscillations of the electron on the beat of the two scattered waves be much less than the inverse of the debye length .",
    "if condition ( [ n3 ] ) is not satisfied , then the beat wave will either experience a strong cherenkov damping ( if @xmath43 ) or the beat wave will not feel the presence of a medium ( if @xmath44 ) , so that the scattering process will be described as induced compton scattering .",
    "in the relativistic plasma with the characteristic lorentz factor of the particles @xmath45 the condition ( [ n3 ] ) is modified . to find the the generalization of condition ( [ n3 ] ) to the case of relativistic plasma we note",
    ", that condition ( [ n3 ] ) may be rewritten in therm of the phase velocities of the beat wave @xmath46 ( which is a plasma wave in case of raman scattering ) and the thermal velocities of the plasma particles @xmath47 .",
    "condition ( [ n3 ] ) then can be rewritten @xmath48    using ( [ n5 ] ) , we find that the phase velocity of the subluminous plasma waves becomes equal to the thermal velocity of plasma particles approximately at @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the following condition should hold for the wave - particles scattering in relativistic pair plasma to be considered as a raman scattering : @xmath50 when @xmath51 the plasma waves are strongly damped and when @xmath52 the wave - particles scattering is described as single particle compton scattering . as we will see later",

    "if , on the other hand , the instability that produces radio emission is intrinsically narrow band with the central frequency of the instability falling into the operational range of the induced raman scattering and changing with radius to mimic the observed broadband spectrum , then the induced raman scattering can be an effective saturation mechanism for a larger range of frequencies .",
