    "star formation is thought to be induced by the gravitational collapse of the dense cores of molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . during this process , angular momentum conservation results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force , a process that eventually halts the infalling matter and leads to the development of a central mass ( protostar ) surrounded by a rotationally supported , gaseous disc . in the presence of an angular momentum transport mechanism , mass accretion on to the protostar",
    "proceeds through this disc , and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of their mass .",
    "a common feature of accreting protostellar systems is their association with energetic bipolar outflows that propagate along the rotation axis of the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the outflows from low - bolometric - luminosity objects ( @xmath4 ) have velocities in the range @xmath5 km s@xmath6 ( of the order of the escape speed from the vicinity of the central protostar ) and are typically well collimated ( opening half - angles @xmath7degrees on scales of @xmath8au ) . the connection between accretion discs and outflows , which extends smoothly from very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ) all the way up to protostars with masses of at least @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is manifested by the observed correlations between accretion diagnostics ( e.g.  inverse p - cygni profiles and excess emission in uv , ir and millimeter wavelengths ) and outflow signatures ( e.g.  p - cygni profiles , optical forbidden lines , thermal radio radiation and the presence of molecular lobes ) in these objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also relevant are the correlations of the type @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) that have been inferred for both accretion and outflow rates in low- and high-@xmath12 objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the joint decline in outflow activity and disc frequency ( as well as in the inferred accretion rate ) with stellar age ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these features point to an underlying physical link between accretion and outflow processes in these systems .",
    "a natural explanation for this connection is that outflows provide an efficient means of transporting away the excess angular momentum and of tapping the liberated gravitational potential energy of the accreted matter . in this scenario ,",
    "disc material is centrifugally accelerated by the torque exerted by a large - scale , ordered magnetic field that threads the disc ( @xcite , hereafter bp82 ; see also the reviews by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a dynamically significant , ordered field component is indicated by the hourglass field morphology detected by polarization measurements in several pre - collapse molecular cloud cores on sub - parsec scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these interstellar field lines are expected to be advected inward when the core undergoes gravitational collapse and could naturally give rise to an ordered field in the resulting protostellar discs .",
    "alternatively , an ordered field component could be generated locally in the disc ( and star ) by a dynamo process .",
    "the comparatively high momentum discharges inferred in protostellar outflow sources are consistent with this interpretation , as alternative wind driving mechanisms would fall far short of the indicated requirements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the centrifugal wind picture can also naturally account for the comparatively high ratio ( @xmath13 ) of the mass outflow to the mass accretion rate that is inferred in both the quiescent and the outburst phases of low - mass protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    vertical angular - momentum transport by a large - scale , ordered magnetic field",
    "is expected to dominate radial angular - momentum transport via turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when the disc is threaded by a comparatively strong magnetic field , corresponding to the ratio @xmath14 of the alfvn speed @xmath15 ( where the subscript 0 denotes the midplane ) to the isothermal sound speed @xmath16 being not much smaller than unity .",
    "note that vertical angular - momentum transport can also be mediated by additional mechanisms ( not considered in this paper ) , including magnetic braking ( the launching of torsional alfvn waves into the ambient interstellar medium ; e.g. @xcite ) , `` failed '' winds ( which do not become supersonic or super - alfvnic ) and non - steady phenomena .",
    "] when this condition is satisfied , angular momentum transport by a small - scale , disordered magnetic field is suppressed because the wavelength of the most unstable mri perturbations exceeds the magnetically reduced disc scale - height ( ( e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hereafter wk93 ) .",
    "on the other hand , when the magnetic field is comparatively weak ( @xmath17 ) , mri - induced radial transport should dominate .",
    "previous studies have considered the aforementioned radial and vertical angular - momentum transport mechanisms under a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "the mri has been analyzed in both its linear and non - linear stages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and through numerical simulations that utilize resistive - mhd codes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is , however , likely that both the radial and vertical modes of angular momentum transport play a role in real accretion discs .",
    "while quasi - steady disc models in which both mechanisms operate had been considered in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they did not specifically link the radial transport of angular momentum with its origin in mri - induced turbulence . in a first attempt in this direction",
    ", @xcite explored the possibility that radial and vertical transport could operate at the same radial location in a protostellar disc .",
    "they derived an approximate criterion for identifying the vertical extent of a wind - driving disc at the given radius that is unstable to mri - induced turbulence and obtained a quantitative estimate ( based on the numerical simulations of @xcite ) of the amount of angular momentum that is removed radially from that region .",
    "an important consideration for the analysis of magnetic angular momentum transport in protostellar discs is that these discs are generally weakly ionized over most of their extents , so magnetic diffusivity effects are significant .",
    "this is a critical issue because both the centrifugal - wind and mri - turbulence transport mechanisms require a minimum level of field ",
    "matter coupling to be effective .",
    "a complete model therefore needs to take into account the detailed ionization and conductivity structure of the disc / wind system . at low densities ( near the disc surfaces and at large radii )",
    "the disc is typically in the _ ambipolar diffusion _ regime . as the density and the shielding column increase ( closer to the disc midplane and the central source ) , the fluid passes successively through the _ hall _ and _ ohm _ diffusivity regimes ( see section  [ sec : formulation ] ) .",
    "note , however , that the disc parameters may well be such that the gas does not clearly correspond to any one of these limiting cases and must instead be described more generally using either the conductivity - tensor ( section  [ subsec : model ] ) or the multi - fluid - decomposition ( section  [ subsec : multi ] ) formulations .",
    "most previous treatments have simplified the problem by focussing on a single conductivity regime .",
    "in particular , wk93 and @xcite concentrated on the ambipolar diffusion limit ( although wk93 also discussed hall - current effects ) .",
    "wk93 were able to obtain simple analytic constraints on the parameter values for physically viable wind - driving disc solutions in this limit by modelling the vertical structure of the disc under the _",
    "( negligible vertical velocity ) approximation .",
    "one of their derived constraints yielded the minimum required degree of field ",
    "matter coupling , and they proceeded to verify their analysis by obtaining numerical solutions for discs in this _ strong coupling _ regime .    although it is in principle possible to seek a self - similar solution for the global disc / wind configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , wk93 adopted a somewhat simpler approach in which they obtained a solution for the vertical structure of a radially localized ( radial extent @xmath18 at a cylindrical radius @xmath19 ) region of the disc and matched it to a self - similar ( in the spherical radial coordinate @xmath20 ) global wind solution of the type originally constructed by bp82 .",
    "this approach facilitated the derivation of viability and consistency constraints involving exclusively the disc model parameters , and subsequently @xcite demonstrated that the basic features of this solution are consistent with those of a fully global disc / wind similarity solution .",
    "our aim in this paper is to generalize the parameter constraints derived in wk93 for the ambipolar diffusion regime to the other basic diffusivity regimes , namely hall and ohm . in each of the latter regimes we identify parameter combinations that yield different sets of constraints , which correspond to solutions with distinct physical properties , and we use these constraints to delineate the hall and ohm sub - regimes in parameter space where one can derive viable , strongly coupled , wind - driving disc solutions . in a follow - up paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper",
    "ii ) we test the results for the hall regime ",
    "derived by using the hydrostatic approximation  against full numerical solutions obtained in the radially localized disc approximation of wk93 .",
    "as noted above , the hall and ohm diffusivity regimes are likely to apply near the midplane in the inner regions of real protostellar discs .",
    "typically , the surface regions from which the wind is driven would be sufficiently well ionized by cosmic rays and by the protostellar radiation field ( see section  [ subsec : model ] ) to lie in the ambipolar diffusion regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , we adopt the approximation that the entire disc cross section between the midplane and the base of the wind lies in a single diffusivity sub - regime in order to bring out the distinct properties of the solutions for each parameter range .",
    "this approximation is less appropriate for the ohm regime , both because _ two _ additional regimes ( ambipolar diffusion _ and _ hall ) would be encountered on the way up to the disc surface in this case and because the column densities of wind - driving discs are relatively small ( especially in comparison with those typically implied by radial - turbulent - transport models ) and are therefore likely to contain only limited regions ( if any at all ) where the ohm diffusivity dominates .",
    "we have nevertheless chosen to include the ohm regime in our analysis of weakly ionized discs for completeness as well as for possible comparisons with resistive - mhd numerical simulations .",
    "the results of this analysis could potentially be applicable also to the collisionally ionized innermost region of the disc , where anomalous resistivity ( the enhanced drag between ions and electrons due to scattering off electromagnetic waves generated by current - driven plasma instabilities ) might develop . to obtain explicit solutions in the different diffusivity regimes ,",
    "we have generalized the wk93 model setup by implementing a conductivity - tensor scheme that can be applied to any given vertical ionization structure . in paper",
    "ii we use a simplified version of this scheme to mimic the single - diffusivity conditions adopted in the present work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : formulation ] summarizes the formulation , including the disc model and the governing equations .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] describes the methodology we employ to reduce these equations to a set of ordinary differential equations in the vertical coordinate @xmath21 and to express them in a dimensionless form ; it also lists the parameters of the problem .",
    "section  [ sec : constraints ] derives the constraints that characterize the parameter space where physically viable solutions exist and explicates them for the hall regime , with the corresponding constraints for the ohm regime presented in section  [ sec : ohm_constraints ] .",
    "the key findings of the paper are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] and summarized in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we model the disc as being in a steady state , geometrically thin , vertically isothermal , nearly keplerian and in dynamical equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the central protostar .",
    "since we expect all the physical variables to exhibit smooth spatial variations , the assumption of geometrical thinness enables us to neglect the radial derivative terms ( @xmath22 ) in our equations in comparison with the vertical derivative terms ( @xmath23 ) , where @xmath19 and @xmath21 are cylindrical coordinates and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the disc pressure ( or density ) scale - height at the radius @xmath19 .",
    "( see wk93 ) . ]",
    "the disc material is assumed to be weakly ionized , with the abundances of charged species being so low that ( i ) the effect of ionization and recombination processes on the neutral gas can be neglected and ( ii ) the inertial , gravitational and thermal forces on the ionized species are negligible in comparison with the electromagnetic force exerted by a large - scale , ordered magnetic field . under these approximations ,",
    "separate equations of motion for the charged species are not required , and their effect on the neutrals can be incorporated via a conductivity tensor @xmath26 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , which is a function of position @xmath27 .",
    "this formulation makes it possible to systematically incorporate different ionized fluid components as well as the three basic field ",

    "the above equations can be used to treat charged species with a wide range of masses and degrees of coupling with the neutral gas . however , to simplify the analysis and make it more transparent , we henceforth specialize to a fluid with only two charged species , one with positive charge ( which we refer to as `` ions '' and denote by a subscript i ; @xmath45 ) and the other with negative charge ( `` electrons , '' subscript e , satisfying @xmath46 ) .",

    "the spatial variation of the latter quantities in protostellar systems results in different diffusion mechanisms dominating in different regions of the disc .",
    "we now briefly outline the main properties of these different regimes , although it must be borne in mind that some regions of the disc will inevitably correspond to the transition zones between two such regimes ( or between any of the sub - regimes that we identify ) and hence can not be so simply classified .    1 .   _",

    "electron plasma is dominated by the electrons , which drift perpendicularly to the magnetic and electric fields ( thereby minimizing the electromagnetic force acting on them , with the electron ",
    "neutral drag force typically remaining negligible ) .",

    "3 .   _ ohm diffusion _ ( @xmath74 ) . in this case",
    "all the ionized species are uncoupled from the field by collisions with the neutrals , so the magnetic field can not be regarded as being frozen into any of the fluid components . in this parameter regime",
    "one can formulate the problem in terms of a simple scalar conductivity , corresponding to the familiar ohmic resistivity .",
    "however , as we show in section  [ sec : ohm_constraints ] , one can not in general neglect the hall term in ohm s law in classifying the physically viable disc solutions in this regime .",
    "the ohm diffusivity may dominate in the most shielded inner regions of particularly massive protostellar discs ( but outside the radius where collisional ionization of alkali metals sets in ) . as we noted in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] , it is also conceivable that _ anomalous _ ohm diffusivity dominates in the collisionally ionized zone further in .",
    "in fact , certain models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) link the formation of a higher ionization zone in the innermost region of the disc to the development of fu orionis - type outbursts , during which most of the accretion on to the central protostar may take place ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this factor can be either @xmath2 or @xmath78 for a @xmath79 two - component plasma in the hall regime .",
    "this suggests that in the latter case one can distinguish between the ambipolar diffusion - modified hall regime , in which the inequalities @xmath80 are satisfied , and the ohm diffusion - modified hall regime , in which the inequalities @xmath81 .    in the fiducial minimum - mass solar nebula model @xcite the ambipolar , hall , and",
    "ohm diffusivity regimes dominate at the disc midplane on scales @xmath82au , @xmath83au and @xmath84au , respectivley , for likely magnetic field strengths and when the effect of grains is neglected .",
    "if sufficiently small ( @xmath85 m ) grains are present at @xmath86 and the density is large enough that they carry a significant fraction of both the negative _ and _ the positive charges then the extent of the midplane hall regime is strongly reduced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "wind - driving accretion - disc models typically have lower column densities and midplane densities than either the minimum - mass model or standard viscous disc models ( a reflection of their comparatively high inward drift speeds ; see section  [ sec : discuss ] ) : this has the effect of pushing both the inner and outer edges of the midplane hall regime inward . in practice ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the different diffusivity regimes depends on the mass accretion rate , the dust content and the nature of the ionization mechanisms that affect the disc , and it could vary from source to source and during the evolution of any particular system .    evaluating the conductivity tensor in a real disc involves calculating the ionization balance and associated abundances of charged species at",
    "any given location .",
    "this balance is , in turn , the result of a delicate equilibrium between ionization and recombination processes acting both in the gas phase and on the surfaces of dust grains ( if present ) .",
    "the most relevant ionization sources outside the central @xmath87au of the disc are nonthermal : x - rays and uv radiation , emanating from the magnetically active young star and its magnetosphere , as well as interstellar cosmic rays and radioactive decay inside the disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , as noted above , some of the distinct parameter sub - regimes that we identified are defined by the inequality @xmath512 . however , even in the latter cases @xmath309 remains bounded from below by a numerical factor that typically is not @xmath77 ( @xmath590 and @xmath591 in the hall and ohm regimes , respectively , from the wind launching condition ; see tables  [ table : constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints ] ) .",
    "the lower bounds on @xmath309 reflect our assumption that the modelled discs are strongly coupled , which implies , in particular , that the transverse magnetic field component starts to grow already at @xmath592 ( see the solution curves presented in paper  ii ) . as was first demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite , viable solutions of discs",
    "in which the bulk of the matter is not well coupled to the field can also be constructed . in these solutions ,",
    "significant field - line bending that enables a centrifugally driven wind to be launched from the disc surface only starts well above the midplane .",
    "although the basic disc properties above the height where @xmath330 starts to increase rapidly are similar to those of strongly coupled configurations , this location depends on the detailed density and ionization structure of the disc and can not be readily determined a priori .",
    "it roughly coincides with the height where @xmath593 ( estimated using equation  [ eq : b_rbb_phib ] ) , which is typically @xmath550 at the midplane under these circumstances , has grown to a value @xmath594 .",
    "however , disc material already moves inward below this height on account of the fact that @xmath595 becomes @xmath596 when @xmath330 is still @xmath77 , which means that a significant magnetic torque ( of density @xmath597 ) can be exerted even at lower elevations .",
    "the magnitude of the field - strength parameter @xmath14 is bounded from below by the sub - keplerian rotation constraint ( the first inequality in tables  [ table : constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints ] ) and from above by the wind - launching constraint ( the second inequality in tables  [ table : constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints ] ) .",
    "if the magnetic field is too weak it will not drive an outflow but instead mediate a `` two - channel '' flow within the disc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , if the field is too strong it will not bend out sufficiently to drive a centrifugal wind .",
    "our typical solutions are characterized by @xmath598 .",
    "we have found that the ratio @xmath599 of the radial to azimuthal magnetic field amplitudes at the disc surface is @xmath78 in the ambipolar diffusion regime ( wk93 ) as well as in all the hall sub - regimes ( section  [ subsec : base ] ) .",
    "however , in the ohm regime this is true only for case  ( @xmath377 ) , whereas in the other two ohm sub - regimes @xmath600 ( see table  [ table : ohm_constraints1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , even in the latter two cases @xmath601 is required to exceed a certain lower bound ( which is at least @xmath602 ; see section  [ subsec : ohm_launching ] ) to satisfy the wind launching condition .",
    "it is also worth noting in this connection that , even if the magnetic field at the disc surface is not bent strongly enough to satisfy the wind launching requirement , vertical magnetic angular - momentum transport along a large - scale field that threads the disc could potentially still take place by other means , such as magnetic braking ( see footnote  [ fn : braking ] ) .        by combining the wind - launching and wind - loading constraints ( the second and third inequalities , respectively , in tables  [ table : constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints ] ) and using the expression for @xmath475 in the fifth column of tables  [ table : constraints1 ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints1 ] , one finds that @xmath603 , i.e. that the vertical confinement of the disc is primarily magnetic ( due to the vertical gradient of ( @xmath604 ) rather than tidal for all the cases in the hall and ohm regimes . this result , which was previously shown by wk93 to apply to ambipolar diffusion - dominated discs , is corroborated by the full solutions presented in paper  ii .",
    "predominantly magnetic confinement is thus seen to be a generic property of our wind - driving disc model .",
    "the generality of this result was , however , questioned by @xcite , who suggested that it might be a consequence of the simplification @xmath605const adopted in our treatment of the mass conservation relation . in addressing this question it is interesting to note that the inequality @xmath606 was inferred in this paper already on the basis of the hydrostatic approximation , which does not make use of the continuity equation . on the other hand ,",
    "our argument involved an estimate of @xmath466 , the normalized height of the disc surface , which corresponds to a disc region where the hydrostatic approximation may no longer be accurate .",
    "a definitive resolution of this issue would require using a more elaborate model in which the above simplification is not made .",
    "the wind - loading and energy dissipation constraints ( the third and fourth inequalities , respectively , in tables  [ table : constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints ] ) provide lower and upper bounds , respectively , on the radial velocity parameter @xmath284 .",
    "the lower bound reflects the fact that the height of the disc surface scales as @xmath475 whereas the scale height scales as @xmath607 , so that @xmath608 , which is required to be @xmath78 , scales as @xmath609 ( see the fifth and sixth columns in tables  [ table : constraints1 ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints1 ] ) .",
    "the upper bound is a consequence of the fact that both the electric field and the current density scale as @xmath284 ( see the seventh column in tables  [ table : constraints1 ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints1 ] ) , so that the joule dissipation ( which scales as @xmath609 ) might exceed the rate of gravitational energy release ( @xmath610 ) if the inflow speed were too high .",
    "the solutions presented in paper  ii have values of @xmath284 in the range @xmath611 . with these parameters",
    "one infers a nominal emptying time @xmath612 for a representative protostellar disc , which is consistent with the mean duration of the earliest ( class  0 ) phase of protostellar evolution but is very much shorter than the total age of accreting protostars .",
    "this is the essence of the `` short evolution time '' critique of pure - wind angular - momentum transport models of protostellar discs , which has led to the argument that alternative angular - momentum transport mechanisms must dominate in such systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .. ] note , however , that even if a centrifugally driven wind does not control the overall evolution of the disc throughout its lifetime , it might still dominate the angular momentum transport in regions of the disc from which strong outflows are launched , which may be especially pertinent during the fu orionis - type rapid accretion episodes that are thought to account for most of the mass deposition on to low - mass protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , wind - mediated angular momentum transport could in principle also contribute in regions where a radial transport mechanism dominates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is also worth noting that significantly lower mean inflow speeds could be attained in more realistic , vertically stratified wind - driving disc models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in particular in _ weakly coupled _ discs ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "further work is , however , required to determine the extent to which this effect would increase the predicted disc evolution time .",
    "we have been careful to use the absolute values of @xmath613 and @xmath614 in delineating the various sub - regimes in the hall and ohm domains in view of the fact that our definition ( equation  [ eq : hall_parameter ] ) of the hall parameters has an explicit dependence on the magnetic field polarity and thus allows them to have both positive and negative values . however , in our table entries for the hall cases  ( @xmath394 ) and  ( @xmath311 ) and for the ohm case  ( @xmath310 ) we implicitly treated the ion and electron hall parameters as _ positive _ quantities .",
    "this can be readily justified by observing that these cases correspond to @xmath615 being @xmath616 and taking note of the inequality @xmath617 ( equation  [ eq : beta ] ) that all viable solutions must obey .",
    "these two inequalities can be simultaneously satisfied only if @xmath618 . in other words , for these parameter sub - regimes a self - consistent wind - driving disc solution can be obtained only if the field has a positive polarity but not if @xmath619 .",
    "the sensitivity to the field polarity reflects the explicit dependence on the hall conductivity in these cases ( see sections  [ subsec : model ] and  [ subsec : ohm_conductivity ] ) and is a specific prediction of our model that is checked in the numerical work presented in paper  ii .",
    "we emphasize that our discussion here concerns the nature of certain sub - regimes , in which _ only _ solutions with @xmath618 are predicted to exist .",
    "this property is distinct from the dependence of wind - driving wind solutions on the field polarity in other parameter sub - regimes in which _ both _ positive and negative values of @xmath335 are allowed but in which changing the sign of @xmath335 modifies the behaviour of the solution ( see wk93 ) .",
    "an example of the latter dependence is given in paper  ii for the hall case  ( @xmath310 ) , which admits @xmath335 values in the range @xmath620 ( see equation  [ beta_eta ] ) .",
    "our analysis has concentrated on discs with a charged - particle composition that can be represented as a two - component plasma consisting of electrons and comparatively massive ions , with the parameter @xmath336 ( equation  [ eq : q ] ) being @xmath77 .",
    "this composition is appropriate to relatively low - density disc regions or even to denser zones that do not contain dust ( see footonote  [ fn : dust ] ) .",
    "weakly ionized disc regions that have densities @xmath621 and contain dust may be better approximated by a two - component , @xmath52 plasma corresponding to oppositely charged grains of equal mass ( see section  [ subsec : model ] ) . in this case",
    "the hall regime is not present ( see equation  [ eq : sigmaratio1 ] ) and the parameter space of viable solutions consists of only two regimes ( ambipolar diffusion and ohm ) .",
    "one can readily verify that , under these circumstances , the ohm domain contains only two sub - regimes , the analogues of the ohm cases  ( @xmath377 ) and  ( @xmath394 ) for a @xmath126 plasma.)-([eq : sigmaratio3 ] ) that the parameter @xmath622 always appears in the conductivity tensor in the combination @xmath623 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath570 in the expressions for the @xmath126 cases  ( @xmath377 ) and  ( @xmath394 ) in tables  [ table : ohm_constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints1 ] is replaced by @xmath624 in the corresponding expressions for @xmath52 . ]",
    "this finding is not surprising in view of the fact ( see section  [ subsec : ohm_conductivity ] ) that the ohm case  ( @xmath310 ) for a @xmath126 plasma arises from the hall - current term in ohm s law , which is missing when @xmath52 .",
    "the viability constraints that we derived on diffusive accretion discs in which the entire excess angular momentum is transported by a centrifugally driven wind can be useful also for generalizing the model to incorporate other modes of angular momentum transport",
    ". in particular , one can argue ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that radial angular - momentum transport through mri - induced turbulence could operate at disc locations where the sub - keplerian rotation constraint ( expressed by the first inequality in tables  [ table : constraints ] and  [ table : ohm_constraints ] , in which the various parameters are taken to have their _ local _ , density - dependent values ) is violated . for example , in the ambipolar diffusion case ( as well as in the hall cases  @xmath377 and  @xmath394 and the ohm cases  @xmath377 and  @xmath394 ) this corresponds to @xmath625 being @xmath362 .",
    "as this quantity is expected to increase with height on account of the increase in the fractional ionization of the gas on going away from the disc midplane , one can envision a situation in which @xmath626 is @xmath362 ( with both radial and vertical angular - momentum transport taking place ) in the vicinity of the midplane but becomes @xmath78 ( with only vertical transfer into a wind remaining relevant ) closer to the disc surfaces .",
    "this criterion can be employed for constructing a `` hybrid '' disc model in which both vertical and radial angular momentum transport take place ( through a large - scale , ordered magnetic field and a small - scale , disordered field , respectively ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we have investigated a protostellar accretion disc model in which the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism is a centrifugally driven wind launched along a large - scale , ordered magnetic field that threads the disc .",
    "the basic assumptions we adopted are the same as those of the radially localized disc model constructed by wk93 , and our main purpose has been to extend the analysis presented in that paper , which focussed on discs in which ambipolar diffusion dominates the magnetic diffusivity inside the disc , to a general diffusivity regime . in particular , we included also the hall and ohm diffusivities , which are relevant to higher - density disc regions than those covered by the wk93 treatment .",
    "we employed a tensor - conductivity scheme that , in conjunction with an ionization - balance calculation , can be used to determine realistic vertical conductivity profiles for protostellar discs in the context of this model .",
    "however , in this paper and its follow - up , paper  ii , we adopt a simpler treatment and assume that the three model parameters that are needed to identify the distinct solution regimes for an ion ",
    "electron plasma remain constant with height in the disc .",
    "the three variables employed for this purpose in the current paper are the electron and ion hall parameters ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , with @xmath627 ) and the neutral  ion coupling parameter @xmath90 ( equation  [ eq : eta ] ) . in paper",
    "ii we use instead two independent ratios of the conductivity tensor components as well as the elsasser number @xmath91 ( see items ( @xmath310 ) and ( @xmath311 ) in section  [ subsec : param ] ) .",
    "we determined the parameter regimes where physically viable disc solutions could be found by employing the hydrostatic approximation and imposing the following requirements ( originally applied in the ambipolar diffusion regime by wk93 and @xcite ) on `` strongly coupled '' systems ( discs in which the magnetic field is dynamically well coupled to the bulk of the matter already at the midplane ) : ( i ) the disc ( in contradistinction to the wind ) rotates at sub - keplerian speeds ; ( ii ) a wind launching condition ( which yields a lower limit on @xmath628 ) is satisfied at the disc surface ; ( iii ) most of the disc material is located below the wind - launching region ; and ( iv ) the rate of joule dissipation does not exceed the rate of gravitational energy release in the disc .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * in addition to the ambipolar diffusion regime considered in wk93 , there are four distinct sub - regimes in the hall diffusion - dominated parameter domain and three distinct sub - regimes in the ohm domain .",
    "( a fourth potential ohm sub - regime was found not to be consistent with the wind - launching requirement . )",
    "the four hall sub - regimes naturally divide into two ambipolar diffusion - like and two ohm - like parameter regions : in the former pair one of the sub - regimes has the same structural properties as the ambipolar diffusion regime , whereas in the latter pair the solution characteristics of one of the sub - regimes are identical to those of one of the ohm sub - regimes . in the case (",
    "not treated in detail in this paper ) of a high - density disc plasma dominated by oppositely charged grains of equal mass , only an ambipolar diffusion regime and an ohm regime ( with two sub - regimes corresponding to our ohm cases  @xmath377 and  @xmath394 ) are present . *",
    "all viable solutions , irrespective of the diffusivity regime , are found to satisfy @xmath304 .",
    "the physical requirement expressed by this condition , that the neutral  ion momentum exchange time be shorter than the disc orbital time , is thus indicated to be a fundamental constraint on wind - driving discs of this type . *",
    "viable solutions are also characterized by the parameters @xmath14 ( midplane alfvn - to - sound speed ratio ) and @xmath284 ( midplane inflow - to - sound speed ratio ) being @xmath596 . however , weakly coupled discs , characterized by values of @xmath309 ( the midplane value of the elsasser number ; see section  [ subsec : param ] ) that are @xmath77 , could have @xmath629 and @xmath630 . in such systems",
    "a significant bending of the magnetic field away from the rotation axis ( required for driving a centrifugally driven wind ) takes place only above some finite height in the disc , although vertical angular momentum transport along the large - scale field typically occurs already at lower elevations .",
    "although our analysis does not directly apply to weakly coupled discs , our results should be useful for understanding the basic qualitative aspects of their behaviour . * the wind - launching and wind - loading conditions ( the aforementioned requirements  ( @xmath394 ) and  ( @xmath310 ) , respectively ) together imply that magnetic squeezing ( by the gradient of the magnetic pressure force associated with the transverse field components @xmath174 and @xmath185 ) dominates the gravitational tidal compression of the disc .",
    "a more elaborate model is , however , needed to verify the full generality of this result .",
    "* the transverse magnetic field at the disc surface is dominated by the radial component in all the hall parameter sub - regimes ( including their `` twins '' in the ambipolar - diffusion and ohm domains ) , and by the azimuthal component in the remaining two ohm sub - regimes . however , even in the latter two cases the poloidal surface magnetic field must be sufficiently strongly bent to satisfy the wind launching requirement .",
    "centrifugally driven winds are not the only means of vertical angular momentum transport in a protostellar disc ( magnetic braking is an example of another option ) , and there are also alternative mechanisms that involve radial transport along the plane of the disc .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to investigate the limiting case in which wind transport dominates at a given radius in view of the ubiquity of energetic outflows in protostellar systems and the inferred association of disc winds with fu orionis - type high - accretion - rate events .",
    "the constraints considered in our model can also be useful for identifying the parameter regimes where other mechanisms ( such as mri - induced turbulence ) are likely to operate , possibly even at the same radial location as wind - mediated angular momentum transport @xcite .",
    "the parameter regimes that we identified were determined under the assumption that the values of the parameters used in the classification scheme did not vary with height in the disc .",
    "this approximation becomes less accurate as one moves from the ambipolar - diffusion regime to the hall regime and then ( at even higher disc densities and column densities ) to the ohm regime .",
    "in particular , in the latter case it can be expected that if a real disc could be described as being in this regime at the midplane then it would transit to the hall regime further up and would likely be ambipolar diffusion - dominated at the surface .",
    "for this reason ( and also because wind - driving discs might not be massive enough to harbour an ohm regime within their weakly ionized zones ) we have emphasized the hall regime in our discussion and do not consider the ohm domain in paper  ii .",
    "however , our findings for the ohm regime could still be applicable to the innermost , collisionally ionized regions of protostellar discs ( and possibly also to disc regions participating in an fu orionis - type outburst ) , in which an anomalous ohmic resistivity might dominate .",
    "the actual parameter regime that characterizes a given section of an accretion disc of the type that we have modelled will be determined by the global magnetic flux distribution , the density structure ( which depends in part on the mass accretion rate ) and the ionization profile ( which depends in part on the nature of the ionization sources as well as on the disc composition ) .",
    "it is conceivable that some of the sub - regimes that we have identified are not commonly realized in nature or that they correspond to unstable configurations .",
    "more insight into these questions would likely emerge from comparisons with observations as well as from additional analytic and numerical work .",
    "our study has , however , indicated that , if such wind - driving accretion flows are indeed present in real protostellar systems , they will exhibit certain generic properties ( including good neutral  ion coupling , subthermal alfvn and inflow speeds and magnetic squeezing within the field - line bending region ) irrespective of the particular parameter regime to which they correspond .",

    "in their consideration of a weakly ionized disc containing a two - component plasma , wk93 noted the qualitative similarity of solutions characterized by the same value of the parameter combination @xmath631 .",
    "they attributed this result to the fact that the only change in the underlying system of equations introduced by switching to a reference frame that moves with the radial velocity @xmath632 of the poloidal flux surfaces involves the magnitude of the torque that is required to remove the excess angular momentum , so that all radial - velocity terms ( except in the angular momentum equation , which remains unchanged ) are modified simply by subtracting @xmath633 from the radial velocity component .",
    "we appealed to this result in section  [ subsec : param ] to motivate setting @xmath634 in our analysis .",
    "one could however question this approach on the basis of the following consideration .",
    "starting from ohm s law in the form @xmath635 , where @xmath636 is the diffusivity tensor , we rewrite it in terms of normalized quantities as @xmath637    where @xmath638 and where @xmath639 , @xmath640 and @xmath641 are obtained by multiplying the expressions in equations  ( [ eq : etao])([eq : etaa ] ) , respectively , by @xmath642 .",
    "we have also written @xmath643 and @xmath644 for the normalized midplane radial and azimuthal velocities , respectively , of the poloidal flux surfaces . by inspecting equation  ( [ app_eq1:matrix ] ) one",
    "may be induced to infer that , since the off - diagonal terms of the diffusivity tensor dominate in the ambipolar - diffusion and ohm regimes whereas the diagonal terms are dominant in the hall limit , one should retain the latter terms when considering the hall regime and the former terms when treating the other limits .",
    "this inference could be carried over to the analysis of equation  ( [ eq1:matrix ] ) in the text , in which the matrix is related to the inverse of the matrix that appears in equation  ( [ app_eq1:matrix ] ) .",
    "specifically , specializing to the midplane ( where @xmath645 ) and assuming @xmath79 for simplicity , one can use equations  ( [ eq : sigmaratio1])([eq : sigmaratio3 ] ) to deduce that @xmath646 ( with the factor @xmath365 in equations  [ eq : a1 ] and  [ eq : a4 ] representing the ratio @xmath647 ) .",
    "one can similarly deduce that the term @xmath335 in the expressions for @xmath648 and @xmath649 is @xmath650 ( with the term involving @xmath334 in equations  [ eq : a2 ] and  [ eq : a3 ] arising from the advective contribution to the electric field ) . adopting the above reasoning",
    ", it would appear that one should retain the diagonal terms @xmath651 and @xmath652 in the ambipolar - diffusion and ohm regimes and the off - diagonal terms @xmath648 and @xmath649 in the hall limit .",
    "however , this procedure can not be implemented if one sets @xmath165 to be identically zero in equation  ( [ eq1:matrix ] ) , as we have done in our analysis , which casts doubt on the validity of the approach followed in the text .    in addressing this question",
    "it is important to keep in mind the basic attributes of the system that we wish to model .",
    "we are primarily interested in the quasi - steady behaviour of a disc in which mass and poloidal magnetic flux that were originally part of a large - scale equilibrium configuration of a molecular cloud core are carried in by the accretion flow . in this picture",
    ", the accretion is enabled in large measure by the vertical magnetic transport of angular momentum , and the inward motion of the matter is , in turn , responsible for the radial transport of the field lines ( which , however , generally lag behind the matter because of the disc s diffusivity ) .",
    "the vertical magnetic transport of angular momentum implies that @xmath653 and hence that @xmath654 ( see equation  [ eq : phi_alg ] ) , whereas the inward bending of the magnetic field lines by the inflowing gas implies that @xmath655 and hence that @xmath656 ( see equation  [ eq : r_alg ] ) .",
    "the fact that the motion of the field lines is controlled by that of the gas implies that @xmath657 would also be @xmath369 ( see section  [ subsec : dimensionless ] ) . in a similar vein",
    ", we expect the radial velocity of the poloidal field lines ( described by the parameter @xmath658 ) to satisfy @xmath659 ( or , equivalently , @xmath660 ) . and @xmath284 could have opposite signs , but such a situation would likely only arise in the context of a localized , time - dependent phenomenon .",
    "an example of this possibility is provided by the cyclical behaviour exhibited by the core - collapse solutions of @xcite near the boundary of their computational `` central sink . ''",
    "this behaviour is indeed localized ( in both space and time ) and clearly does not correspond to the global , quasi - steady accretion process analyzed in this paper . ]",
    "we now proceed to examine the consequences of the alternative formulation outlined above in light of the just - discussed constraints . to this end , we substitute for @xmath661 and @xmath662 in equation  ( [ eq1:matrix ] ) from equations  ( [ eq : phi_alg ] ) and  ( [ eq : r_alg ] ) , respectively , to obtain @xmath663 @xmath664 in the ambipolar - diffusion and ohm regimes we retain only the @xmath651 and @xmath652 terms . in the ambipolar diffusion limit @xmath665 and @xmath666 ( since @xmath334 is equal in this case to the midplane value of the neutral  field coupling parameter @xmath91 , which is expected to be @xmath78 ) , so equation  ( [ app_eq : a3a4 ] ) implies @xmath667 , which is inconsistent with our expectation that @xmath668 .",
    "similarly , in the ohm limit @xmath669 and @xmath670 , so equation  ( [ app_eq : a3a4 ] ) implies @xmath671 , which is again inferred to be @xmath369 , contrary to our physical expectation . in a similar vein , we retain only the @xmath648 and @xmath649 terms in the hall regime . using equations  ( [ eq : a2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : a3 ] ) and focussing on the case @xmath126 , we infer from equations  ( [ app_eq : a1a2 ] ) and  ( [ app_eq : a3a4 ] ) that @xmath672 and @xmath673 one can readily verify that equations  ( [ app_eq : epsb_eps ] ) and  ( [ app_eq : wer_wphi ] ) can not be simultaneously satisfied while also respecting the constraints @xmath674 and @xmath675 .",
    "these arguments indicate that a formulation based simply on the dominant terms in the conductivity tensor is not physically self - consistent for the problem under consideration .",
    "in contrast , one can verify that the formulation adopted in the text is self - consistent  in the sense that the neglected terms in equations  ( [ app_eq : a1a2 ] ) and  ( [ app_eq : a3a4 ] ) never come to dominate the ones that were retained  under the assumption @xmath676 .",
    "in particular , using the expression  ( [ eq : er ] ) for @xmath458 and equations  ( [ eq : a1])([eq : a4 ] ) , it is straightforward to ascertain that the ratios @xmath677 and @xmath678 remain @xmath679 in this case for all the viable - solution parameter regimes identified in sections  [ sec : constraints ] and  [ sec : ohm_constraints ] ."
