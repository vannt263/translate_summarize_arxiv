    "dissipation due to electron transport in a conductor is an important issue for both fundamental and applied physics [ ] . according to electron transport theory [ ] ,",
    "the conductivity of the electron becomes finite because of impurity scattering inside the conductor , which leads to joule heating @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the electric current density and electric field , respectively . motivated to reduce power consumption due to joule heating , as well as because of a fundamental interest in its quantum mechanical nature , the generation of a pure spin - current by spin pumping , spin - seebeck effect , or spin - hall effect has been extensively investigated [ ] .",
    "dissipation is associated with the production of entropy .",
    "spin - flip processes and spin - dependent scatterings within a bulk ferromagnet ( f ) or nonmagnet ( n ) and at an f / n interface mix the spin - up and spin - down states , leading to a change of the entropy",
    ". therefore a physical system , such as a f / n metallic multilayer , carrying a pure spin - current , still dissipates energy even in the absence of an electric current . a quantitative evaluation of the dissipation due to pure spin - current therefore is a fundamentally important problem .",
    "in 1987 , johnson and silsbee [ ] studied the surface and bulk transport coefficients for spin conduction , and the associated entropy production rates , without considering the rate of interface heating .",
    "more recently , sears and saslow [ ] used irreversible thermodynamics to study interface heating due to electric current in a magnetic system , and tulapurkar and suzuki [ ] used the boltzmann equation to investigate bulk and interface heating for spin conduction . reference [ ] shows that , roughly speaking , the dissipation due to spin current is proportional to the square of the spin polarization of the conduction electrons , indicating that the heating associated with the spin current is much smaller than that due to the electric current .",
    "however , these works consider only a collinear alignment of the magnetizations in a f / n multilayer , so only the longitudinal components of the spin current and spin accumulation ( i.e. , spin chemical potential , proportional to the nonequilibrium spin density ) appear .",
    "( _ longitudinal _ and _ transverse _ will be used to mean that the direction of the spin polarization is collinear or normal to the local magnetization . ) on the other hand , in many physical phenomena , such as spin torque switching [ ] and spin pumping [ ] , a non - collinear alignment of the magnetizations generally appears , in which transverse spin current and spin accumulation exist .",
    "for example , spin pumping is a generation of the transverse spin current by the transfer of spin angular momentum from the ferromagnetic layer to the conduction electrons [ ] .",
    "bulk heating due to spin pumping in a magnetic wire within a domain wall ( driven by @xmath3 ) has also been studied [ ] , but was not extended to include interface heating . in these works ,",
    "the main contribution to the dissipation arises from the electric current .",
    "the present work develops a unified theory of dissipation which enables the simultaneous evaluation of both bulk and interface heating in a ferromagnetic system , with the spin current having arbitrary alignment of the magnetizations .",
    "also , an evaluation of the dissipation due to a pure spin - current is indispensable for comparison with experiments that determine the rate of heating .",
    "this paper develops a general theory of dissipation in the presence of spin current based on the spin - dependent transport theory and thermodynamics .",
    "it is found that , along with the conventional joule heating , the spin current @xmath4 ( or its density @xmath5 ) and spin accumulation @xmath6 contribute to the bulk and interface dissipations , as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dissipation_volume ] ) and ( [ eq : dissipation_area ] ) .",
    "we apply the theory to evaluate the dissipation due to a pure spin - current generated by spin pumping in the ferromagnetic ( f@xmath7 ) / nonmagnetic ( n ) / ferromagnetic ( f@xmath8 ) multilayer .",
    "spin pumping provides an interesting example to study the dissipation problem of pure spin - current . in spin pumping",
    ", electric current is absent throughout the system .",
    "the electron transport is described by a one - dimensional equation , and an external temperature gradient is absent , which makes evaluation of the dissipation simple compared with the spin - seebeck effect or spin - hall effect .",
    "it is found that the dissipation is proportional to the enhancement of the gilbert damping by spin pumping .",
    "the amount of the dissipation due to the spin pumping is maximized for an orthogonal alignment of the two magnetizations . for the conditions we study ,",
    "the maximum dissipation is estimated to be two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the dissipation due to the electric current when there is spin torque switching .",
