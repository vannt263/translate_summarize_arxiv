    "<S> prompted by intriguing events observed in certain particle - physics searches for rare events , we study light and acoustic emission simultaneously in some inorganic scintillators subject to mechanical stress . </S>",
    "<S> we observe mechanoluminescence in ,  and , in various mechanical configurations at room temperature and ambient pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the temporal and amplitude correlations between the light emission and the acoustic emission during fracture . </S>",
    "<S> a novel application of the precise energy calibration of  provided by radioactive sources allows us to deduce that the fraction of elastic energy converted to light is at least @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> rare - event searches in particle physics , like those looking for particle dark matter  @xcite , employ draconian measures to reduce all forms of background that could hide their signal . </S>",
    "<S> the main background is usually of radioactive nature , however other forms are possible . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the first , calorimetric phase of the cresst experiment measured phonons in sapphire crystals cooled to around @xmath1 to detect particle interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initially , thermal contraction of the holders caused fractures in the crystals , limiting sensitivity of the experiment by three orders of magnitude in rate above the radioactive background until the problem was identified  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> certain more recent experiments use a coupled measurement of phonons and scintillation to determine the nature of the interacting particles and reject the radioactive background  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , mechanoluminescence , i.e. the emission of light by a solid subject to mechanical stress , occurs in many materials  @xcite , including plastic scintillators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , correlated acoustic emission ( ae ) and visible - photon emission have been observed during mechanical deformation of colored alkali halides  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other types of emission , including electrons  @xcite , positive ions  @xcite , and x - rays  @xcite , have also been studied in various materials under mechanical stress . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there is an opinion that fracture events in scintillation - phonon detectors would produce little or no light ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> prompted by recent intriguing events observed by the cresst  ii dark matter search using cryogenic scintillation - phonon  detectors  @xcite , we study mechanoluminescence as a form of photon - producing background in such devices . we also argue that photon emission can help characterize the rupture dynamics in a manner analogous to ae  @xcite , and can provide complementary information about the fracture energy . </S>",
    "<S> to investigate these two points , we have carried out what we believe are the first experiments to correlate the acoustic and light emission from common scintillators under mechanical stress , and to quantify the conversion of elastic energy into light .    </S>",
    "<S> our studies involve the measurement of acoustic phonons and luminescence as a piece of scintillating crystal is stressed to the point of rupture . </S>",
    "<S> the inorganic scintillators studied here are widely used in particle detection  @xcite : bismuth germanate ( , a.k.a . </S>",
    "<S> bgo ) , zinc tungstate ( ) and cadmium tungstate ( ) . except where specified </S>",
    "<S> , all samples were kindly supplied by crystal manufacturing  lab  ltd . , novosibirsk . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested two loading geometries , at room temperature and ambient pressure . </S>",
    "<S> initially , @xmath2 rectangular prisms were indented by a steel bead driven by a manual screw , causing the material to break in multiple fragments . in order to better control the rupture process </S>",
    "<S> , we subsequently adopted the double cleavage drilled compression ( dcdc ) geometry  @xcite ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_fig_1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these samples were @xmath3 rectangular prisms , polished to optical quality , with a @xmath4 diameter circular hole drilled perpendicularly in the middle of the @xmath5 face . under compression along the long axis , </S>",
    "<S> cracks formed reproducibly on either side of the hole in the plane parallel to the @xmath6 face . unlike bgo , tungstates have a cleavage plane  @xcite ; orientation of the crystals was chosen so that this plane was parallel to the dcdc fracture direction . </S>",
    "<S> the dcdc samples were pressed against a backstop by a pushrod that was driven by an actuator ( controlled manually in early experiments , and by computer in later ones ) . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry provides some control of crack velocity via the applied compressive stress , up to a critical length at which point the sample cleaves abruptly  @xcite . a force gauge in the pushrod measured the load imposed by displacements of the actuator . </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic activity was recorded by two piezo - electric pinducers in contact with opposite sides of the crystal via ultrasound gel . </S>",
    "<S> light emission was recorded by a standard bialkali photomultiplier ( pm ) covering the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the output of the pm was integrated with a time constant ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 depending on the sample to produce a signal that could be digitized more slowly than the raw pm output . </S>",
    "<S> all four channels ( force , 2 ae , pm ) were digitized at a rate of @xmath9 samples per second in a continuous stream . </S>",
    "<S> the setpoint of the computer - controlled actuator was also recorded .    </S>",
    "<S> the fracture procedure involves advancing the actuator by small steps ( down to @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> each step is followed by a waiting time of at least @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the whole procedure lasts @xmath12@xmath13 during which we continuously monitor ae and pm activity . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_mainresult ] shows typical observations for the tungstate crystals .    </S>",
    "<S> spurts of activity on the ae and pm channels are correlated to drops in the force . </S>",
    "<S> these abrupt force relaxations are a direct consequence of crack growth in the samples . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a regime in which the force decreases slowly , and during which other processes , such as rearrangements and dislocations , produce ae and pm signals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar correlations have been observed for other materials , such as colored  @xcite , composites  @xcite , and silica glass  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indentation of bgo samples ( from fibercryst , france ) also produces correlated ae and light signals . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations can be analyzed more quantitatively by looking at the statistical properties of individual acoustic and light events . </S>",
    "<S> in this analysis , individual events have been determined on each channel by requiring that the signal surpass a threshold , and that it be separated from the previous event by at least a minimum time . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_wait_extra ] shows that the distributions of waiting times between events are similar for ae and light over two decades . for light events , it is possible to obtain a much smaller minimum separation time ( @xmath14 ) than for ae ( @xmath15 ) , since the former pulses are shorter than the latter .    to quantify the amount of light emitted and to investigate the emission mechanism , we next compared the spectra of light emitted by bgo ( sample from fibercryst ) during fracture and during scintillation stimulated by x - rays . to avoid afterglow from the high dose of x - rays , </S>",
    "<S> the fracture spectrum was measured first , and then one of the fragments was measured while being irradiated by x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of the light spectra were carried out with a monochromator and a ccd camera . in the x - ray excitation configuration , a generator provided x - rays with a broad spectrum up to a few tens of  . over the recorded range of wavelengths , both resulting spectra ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_spectra ] ) show a very similar shape ( as is the case for many materials  @xcite ) , indicating a common underlying luminescence mechanism , at least for the last stages of light emission .    </S>",
    "<S> the likeness of our spectra to previous work on bgo indicates this last stage involves @xmath16 electronic transitions of the  luminescence centers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement does not determine if the fractures excite the luminescence centers directly . </S>",
    "<S> it can not be excluded that the crystal is indirectly excited by particles produced by fracto - emission  @xcite interacting in the scintillator . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if x - rays or electrons are produced , the bgo sample would be quite efficient at detecting them itself ( attenuation length @xmath17 for @xmath18 x - rays  @xcite ) , as opposed to needing an external x - ray detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , any uv light ( potentially from arcs in the atmosphere near the fracture ) might be re - absorbed in the scintillator since bgo absorbs wavelengths below @xmath19  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we then calibrated the light channel for a dcdc bgo sample using radioactive @xmath20-ray sources as we would calibrate a regular scintillator used for particle detection . </S>",
    "<S> calibration was carried out in the main dcdc setup and with the standard daq ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_fig_1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis involves extracting individual events as described earlier , and then building the distribution of the event integrals . </S>",
    "<S> the integral of an event , like its amplitude , is a proxy for the energy deposited by the @xmath20 , so we can identify the peaks in the distribution corresponding to the energies of the radioactive sources and of backscattering  @xcite , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_calibr ] .    over the energy range available with these sources , </S>",
    "<S> the crystal and readout behave in a linear manner with respect to the energy deposited in the scintillator , and we extrapolate this calibration to higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> calibrations before and after the fracture are compatible to within @xmath21 . from the standpoint of the scintillation mechanism , @xmath20-rays and x - rays can interact in inorganic scintillators via the photoelectric effect or through compton scattering , creating a primary electron - hole pair which eventually transfers a portion of the deposited energy to the luminescence centers (  for bgo ) . for a given light signal , </S>",
    "<S> calibrations provide the equivalent amount of energy deposited by a @xmath20-ray . </S>",
    "<S> this can be converted to the actual energy of the emitted light by knowing the light yield of the scintillator ( @xmath22 for @xmath20-rays in bgo  @xcite ) , and the energy of individual scintillation photons ( @xmath23 c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig  [ fig_spectra ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the calibrated bgo crystal was then fractured in the main dcdc setup , using the protocol described earlier . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the last drop in force , occurring when the crack splits the sample in two . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig_bgobreak ] shows that the overall behavior is similar to that observed for the tungstates .    </S>",
    "<S> the photon channel displays a wide distribution of event amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> they in fact reach up to the saturation level of the integrator , equivalent to @xmath20-ray energy deposits of @xmath24  a testimony to the amount of light emitted . </S>",
    "<S> there is also a hint of increased photonic activity before the main fracture occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations are better quantified in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_corr_extra ] illustrating the cumulative number of events on the acoustic channels and those on the photon channel .    </S>",
    "<S> minimum separation time required between photon events was @xmath8 , and @xmath25 between ae events . </S>",
    "<S> on all three channels , the cumulative number of events rises steadily with a slight increase in slope until the fracture , as determined by the drop in the force . </S>",
    "<S> this drop marks a sharp increase in the slope of cumulative events that eventually peters out . </S>",
    "<S> when normalized to the total number of events on each channel , all curves are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , event amplitudes for all channels are power - law distributed ( fig .  [ fig_hist_spectra ] ) . for both ae channels , </S>",
    "<S> the exponents are @xmath26 ( errors are one standard deviation ) . assuming the ae energy is proportional to the amplitude squared </S>",
    "<S> , the power - law distribution of the energy would have as exponent @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the exponent obtained for the light channel , @xmath28 , for which amplitude is proportional to energy . </S>",
    "<S> a more precise measurement might check if the absolute value of the ae exponent is in fact larger than that of the light channel , an indication of dissipation in the acoustic channel  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also use our technique to estimate certain contributions to the energy budget of the rupture process in bgo . </S>",
    "<S> elastic energy is converted into broken bonds , phonons ( that are either measured as acoustic emission or decay into heat ) and light . </S>",
    "<S> for the emitted light , the calibrations with @xmath20-ray sources establish that the total amount of emitted light is equivalent to that caused by @xmath20-ray energy deposits of at least @xmath29 , in other words a total energy converted to light greater than @xmath30 . only a lower bound </S>",
    "<S> is set because of integrator saturation mentioned previously . </S>",
    "<S> eighty - five percent of this light is emitted in a @xmath31 window centered on the main fracture . </S>",
    "<S> we next estimate the drop in elastic energy of the crystal during the main fracture . neglecting the hole in the dcdc geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the elastic energy in the crystal of section @xmath32 ( perpendicular to the force @xmath33 ) and of volume @xmath34 is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is young s modulus . applying a standard acoustic measurement of longitudinal and shear waves  @xcite to bgo </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath37 , somewhat above the range of published values ( up to @xmath38  @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the loaded volume and surface vary little , the drop in force of @xmath39 is equivalent to a drop in elastic energy of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> since the surface created during the fracture is roughly @xmath41 , this amounts to a surface creation energy of the order of @xmath42 , consistent with the scales typically found for crystals ( e.g. @xmath43 for  , @xmath44 for  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the conversion efficiency of elastic to luminous energy is therefore at least @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> . a fuller understanding of the energy budget requires knowledge of the energy transformed into phonons , or heat . </S>",
    "<S> the standard room - temperature technique to study brittle fracture only involves measurement of acoustic phonons using acoustic emission . </S>",
    "<S> we are not aware of any work quantifying the fraction of energy going into acoustic phonons , or calibrating the energy scale of acoustic phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the harder - to - implement technique of cryogenic calorimetry would allow measurement of all the phonons and would therefore provide more insight into the energy budget  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have evidenced correlated mechanical - stress - induced emission of photons and of phonons in several common inorganic scintillators used for particle detection ( ,  and ) , at room temperature and in a normal atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> at least for bgo , both emissions share similar distributions of waiting times over several decades . also for bgo , </S>",
    "<S> the two energy distributions are similar , and the wavelength of fractoluminescence is the same as that of scintillation . in a mechanically - stressed scintillation - only detector , the power - law distribution of mechanoluminescence energies means that spurious low - energy events may mimick dark matter ones . </S>",
    "<S> it seems reasonable to assume our results apply to other tungstates , and it would be interesting to study the light - phonon correlations of individual fracture events in cresst  ii - like conditions of vacuum and low - temperature ( other background - based explanations of the intriguing cresst  ii events have been proposed  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the re - absorption of products of fracto - emission could affect other types of solid - state particle detectors ( e.g. ionization or ionization - phonon ones  @xcite ) . from the standpoint of fracture physics , in contrast to previous studies by acoustic emission or by spectrally - resolved luminescence ( e.g.  @xcite ) , our use of the light channel offers a precisely calibrated energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to quantify the amount of elastic energy converted into light , and is a step towards a better fundamental understanding of fracture mechanisms . </S>"
