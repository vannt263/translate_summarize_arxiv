    "the cosmic acceleration is realized with negative pressure and positive energy density that violate the strong energy condition .",

    "measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today .",
    "the de model has been characterized in a conventional manner by the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath8 which is not necessarily constant , where @xmath9 is the energy density and @xmath10 is the fluid pressure ( carroll and hoffman 2003 ) .",
    "the present data seem to slightly favour an evolving dark energy with eos @xmath11 around the present epoch and @xmath12 in the near past . obviously , @xmath2 can not cross @xmath13 for quintessence or phantom alone .",
    "some efforts have been made to build a dark energy model whose eos can cross the phantom divide .",
    "the simplest de candidate is the vacuum energy ( @xmath14 ) , which is mathematically equivalent to the cosmological constant ( @xmath4 ) .",

    "the cmb radiation is also considered to be a major experimental evidence on which the most commonly accepted theory about the origin of universe , i.e. `` big - bang '' cosmology , is based .",
    "statistical isotropy ( si ) is usually assumed in almost all cmb studies .",
    "but , now , there exist many indications which suggest that cmb may violate this assumption .",
    "apart from the cmb there are some other indications of violation of si which suggest the existence of a preferred direction in the universe .",
    "these indications include distributions of polarizations from radio galaxies ( birch 1982 ; jain & ralston 1999 ; jain et al .",
    "2004 ) and statistics of optical polarizations from quasars ( hutsem@xmath25kers 1998 ; hutsem@xmath25kers & lamy 2001 ; jain et al .",

    "polarization of electromagnetic waves coming from distant radio galaxies and quasars measured at radio and optical frequencies respectively are not consistent with the assumptions of si , rather radio polarizations are organized coherently over the dome of the sky and optical polarizations are aligned in a preferential direction on very large scales , violating the assumed isotropy of the universe .",
    "these study confirmed strong significance of anisotropy and also claimed that the statistics are not consistent with isotropy at @xmath26 confidence level .",
    "it has also been observed that the quadrupole and the octopole have almost all their power perpendicular to a common axis in space pointing towards virgo cluster ( tegmark et al .",
    "2003 ; de oliveira - costa 2004 ) .",
    "the dipole , which is commonly attributed to our motion relative to the cmb rest frame , also aligns in the same direction as quadrupole and octopole which is not expected under the condition of statistical isotropy .",
    "another indication of anisotropy in cmb data is the presence of a cold spot with improbably low temperature .",
    "it was found by cruz et al .",

    "2007 ) along with the possibility of anisotropic inflation ( hunt & sarkar 2004 ; buniy et al . 2006 ; donoghue et al . 2009 ) .",
    "+ the possible violation of global isotropy in the cmb has been a subject of intense research after the publication of wmap data .",
    "the possible alignment of axes corresponding to several diverse data sets in the direction of the virgo cluster makes this extremely interesting . in recent years ,",
    "there have been a large number of studies which claim the cmb temperature fluctuations are not consistent with statistical isotropy and thus questioning the cosmological principle .",
    "the cmb is considered to be a major experimental evidence which supports the current / present models of the observed universe and from this cmb observations several people found significant of anisotropic scenario .",
    "based on these studies one may not preclude the possibility that our universe is anisotropic . + there is a general agreement among cosmologists that cosmic microwave s background anisotropy in the small angle scale holds the key to the formation of the discrete structure . the theoretical argument ( misner 1968 ) and the modern experimental data support the existence of an anisotropic phase , which turns into an isotropic one .",
    "the anisotropy of the de within the framework of bianchi type space - times is found to be useful in generating arbitrary ellipsoidality of the universe , and to fine tune the observed cmbr anisotropies .",
    "koivisto and mota ( 2008a , 2008b ) have investigated cosmological models with anisotropic eos and have also shown that the present sn ia data allows large anisotropy . recently ,",
    "akarsu and kilinc ( 2010c ) have described some features of the bianchi type - i universes in presence of fluid that wields an anisotropic eos .",
    "hence , for a realistic cosmological model one should consider spatially homogeneous and anisotropic space - times and then show whether they can evolve to the observed amount of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "the only spatially homogeneous but anisotropic models other than bianchi type models are the kantowski - sachs locally symmetric family .",

    "this ensures that the model is spatially homogeneous .",
    "+ the simplest generalization of eos parameter of perfect fluid may be to determine the eos parameter separately on each spatial axis by preserving the diagonal form of the energy momentum tensor in a consistence way with the considered metric .",
    "therefore , the energy momentum tensor of fluid can be written , most generally , in anisotropic diagonal form as follows : @xmath42\\ ] ] allowing for anisotropy in the pressure of the fluid , and thus in its eos parameter , gives rise to new possibilities for the evolution of the energy source . to see this , we first parametrize the energy momentum tensor given in ( [ eq2 ] ) as follows : @xmath43\\ ] ] @xmath44\\rho\\ ] ] @xmath45\\rho.\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is the proper energy density , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the pressures , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the directional eos parameters along the @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath23 axes , respectively ; @xmath2 is the deviation - free eos parameter of the fluid .",

    "+ the spatial volume for the model ( [ eq1 ] ) is given by @xmath63 we define @xmath64 as the average scale factor so that the hubble s parameter is anisotropic and may be defined as @xmath65 the deceleration parameter @xmath66 , the scalar expansion @xmath67 , shear scalar @xmath68 and the average anisotropy parameter @xmath69 are defined by @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",

    "two additional constraints relating these parameters are required to obtain explicit solutions of the system .",

    "2011 ; kumar and yadav 2011 ; yadav 2011 ) , as it duly gives a power law for metric function or corresponding quantity .",
    "the motivation to choose such time dependent dp is behind the fact that the universe is accelerated expansion at present as observed in recent observations of type ia supernova ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; tonry et al . 2003 ; riess et al . 2004 ; clocchiatti et al . 2006 ) and cmb anisotropies ( bennett et al . 2003 ; de bernardis et al . 2000 ; hanany et al .",

    "now for a universe which was decelerating in past and accelerating at the present time , the dp must show signature flipping ( see the refs .",
    "padmanabhan and roychowdhury ( 2003 ) , amendola ( 2003 ) , riess et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ) .",
    "so , in general , the dp is not a constant but time variable .",
    "this motivates to choose such a scale factor which yields a time - dependent dp . at this juncture",
    "it should be stated that some authors first choose the scale factors in power law , exponential or in other form and then find out other variables with some conditions under these solutions .",
    "+ in this paper , following saha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and pradhan & amirhashchi ( 2011b ) , we take following _ ansatz _ for the scale factor , where increase in term of time evolution is @xmath81 where @xmath3 is a positive constant .",

    "( 2011 ) and pradhan & amirhashchi ( 2011b ) examined the relation ( [ eq20 ] ) in studying two - fluid scenario for dark energy models in an frw universe and accelerating de models in bianchi type - v space - times respectively .",

    "( 2011b ) .",
    "if we put @xmath82 in eq .",

    "this choice of scale factor yields a time - dependent deceleration parameter ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) ) such that before de era , the corresponding solution gives inflation and radiation / matter dominance era with subsequent transition from deceleration to acceleration .",
    "thus , our choice of scale factor is physically acceptable . + it is worth mention here that one can also select many to many _ ansatz _ other than eq . ( [ eq20 ] ) which mimic accelerating universe but one should also be careful to check the physical acceptability and stability of their corresponding solutions",
    "otherwise does not prove any relation of such solutions with observable universe .",
