    "the first magnetization plateau at lower magnetic fields is of the same origin as described previously , i.e. the doping with the mobile electrons causes a gradual onset of the antiferromagnetic spin order of the localized ising spins due to the effective antiferromagnetic coupling mediated by the bonds occupied with two hopping electrons with an opposite spins . on the other hand ,",
    "the additional intermediate plateau observed at moderate magnetic fields emerges owing to a mutual competition between the magnetic field and the quantum - mechanical hopping process .",

    "[ entropy ] displays typical isentropic dependences of temperature on the magnetic field for the hopping term @xmath102 and three different electron densities @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "a vigorous drop of the temperature upon the adiabatic demagnetization observable slightly above zero magnetic field implies an intriguing refrigeration potential of the studied spin - electron system , which is capable of reaching ultra - low temperatures down to the absolute zero temperature .",
