    "in fact , the stellar content can be neglected at all radii without greatly affecting the fit .",

    "this lower limit is reached for @xmath10  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 , while the limited extent of the circular velocity curve prevents the derivation of a proper upper limit .",
    "although @xcite s ( @xcite ) measurement using @xcite method is plagued by uncertainties , it is consistent with the idea that bars in dense halos should be slow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "because is isolated , gravitational interactions can not be invoked as an exciting mechanism either @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed two alternatives : i ) the disk is embedded in a massive and extended triaxial dark halo with a rotating figure , forcing the bar and spiral pattern at a certain frequency , or ii ) ( some ) dark matter is distributed in a disk closely following the distribution , rendering the disk gravitationally unstable .",
    "although both solutions lack direct observational support ( but see @xcite for the latter ) , they offer a way forward .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether either ( or both ) of these mechanisms works in practice . the rotating halo shall be modeled by external forcing from a rotating triaxial potential ( which could be due to a rotating triaxial halo , bulge , central bar , or a mixture of those ) , and the massive disk will be modeled by simply scaling up the gaseous surface density of the disk .",
    "we test the models by running a simple two - dimensional ( hereafter 2d ) hydrodynamic code , exploring the available parameter space , and comparing with the observations . in   [ sec : method ] , we first present the relevant parameters for both sets of models and describe suitable observational constraints .",

    "the circular velocity rises within @xmath15  kpc and levels out at @xmath16  km  s@xmath7 at larger radii .",
    "the velocity dispersion is the usual @xmath17  km  s@xmath7 outside 5  kpc but is much higher in the central regions , justifying the use of an asymmetric drift correction to the rotation curve by @xcite .",
    "we note however that the velocity dispersion in the central regions may be overestimated due to beam smearing effects ( although @xcite argue against this ) , and that in turn the circular velocity may be over - corrected ( i.e.  overestimated ) within @xmath18  kpc .",
    "the toomre @xmath19 parameter @xcite estimated from this data is high everywhere ( @xmath20 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that gravitational instabilities such as swing @xcite can not grow if one assumes that the observed gas surface density accounts for the entire disk mass . as mentioned above , to force the emergence of spiral arms , one can then study the response of the disk to an external forcing potential or artificially increase the disk mass .    to fit the models to the observations , one needs to identify the relevant constraints provided by the data and the parameters one can adjust to improve the match .",
    "the basic constraints are provided by the first three moments of the data cube , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iv_images][fig : ivs_profiles ] , but we refine these below .",
    "although the disk response in is likely non - linear , it is instructive to look at the dispersion relation for an @xmath21-folded density wave in a thin isothermal disk of sound speed @xmath22 , in the wkb limit @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the radial wave vector , @xmath26 is the pattern frequency of the bar and spiral arms ( i.e.  the pattern frequency of the forcing potential ) , @xmath27 is the orbital frequency ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "we shall neglect hereafter the possibility that the spiral arms have a different ( slower ) pattern speed than the bar , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "inspection of the amplitude spectra ( or periodograms ) of the @xmath30 perturbations which appear in our runs shows that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "more precisely , one could think of a halo with a slow figure rotation , the ilr of which would coincide with the disk spiral corotation .",
    "we have performed early runs with halo pattern speeds down to @xmath31  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 , and the power spectra of the disk response show no trace at all of any response at any other frequency than @xmath26 .",
    "this is not entirely a surprise however : on the contrary to what happens for a massive collisionless disk , the spiral density waves propagate _ inwards _ from the ilr and _ outwards _ from the olr , while most of the [ ilr , olr ] band is a forbidden band for density waves propagation . the wave that a slow halo linearly excites at its ilr ( at large radius ) can therefore naturally propagate inwards , and one does not need to invoke non - linear coupling to account for a disk response in the disk .",
    "furthermore , non - linear coupling efficiency is weakened in the present situation with respect to a stellar disk .",
    "indeed , non - linear coupling can be shown to be efficient whenever the resonances of partner waves coincide ( for instance corotation and lindblad resonance ) .",
    "a simple argument for that is that the waves spend a lot of time there , since their group velocities vanish , and they therefore have a large amount of time to exchange , non - linearly , a significant amount of energy and angular momentum . in a collisionless system",
    "the integral @xmath32 diverges , where @xmath33 is a lindblad resonance location and @xmath34 is the wave group velocity , which makes non - linear coupling a very efficient process in stellar disks @xcite . in a non or weakly self - gravitating gaseous disk however",
    ", this integral is finite , and the non - linear coupling efficiency is therefore much lower with respect to a collisionless situation .",
    "we shall assume hereafter that the dynamics of the disk of can be adequately modeled with an isothermal gas disk in which the sound speed is equal everywhere to the observed velocity dispersion , assumed to be isotropic : @xmath35 .",
    "( [ eq : disp_rel ] ) shows that once @xmath26 is fixed , @xmath36 ( and therefore @xmath25 ) follows , as @xmath27 , @xmath29 , @xmath37 , and @xmath22 are all observables .",
    "more precisely , @xmath36 is given by a second - order polynomial equation admitting two roots , corresponding to the so - called long and short waves .",
    "in the regime where @xmath19 is high ( i.e.  when the term @xmath38 is negligible ) , the two roots are very close to each other , and one can consider only the short wave .",
    "@xmath25 is related to the pitch - angle @xmath39 of the spiral pattern by @xmath40 therefore , given the observations and a guess at the pattern frequency of the perturber ( and thus , in a forced regime , of the wave ) , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : disp_rel ] ) and ( [ eq : pitch ] ) directly yield the pitch angle of the spiral pattern .",
    "one thus only needs to adjust the perturber frequency to match the observed pitch angle , which can be estimated observationally by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 traces the spiral arms and @xmath43 is the azimuthal angle in a deprojected map of the galaxy .",
    "the deprojected surface density of in @xmath44 coordinates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : i_logrtheta_obs ] for an inclination @xmath45 ( see below ) . from this image , we obtain @xmath46 for the main feature at @xmath47 ( mod .",
    "@xmath48 ) , @xmath49  kpc , and @xmath50 for the secondary features such as @xmath51 ( mod .",
    "@xmath48 ) , @xmath52  kpc .    in the linear regime ,",
    "the wave amplitude ( which does not appear in the dispersion relation ) is independent of its pitch - angle .",
    "one can thus successively adjust the perturber pattern frequency and strength in order to match , respectively , the spiral pattern pitch - angle and arm - interarm contrast . in , however , the arm - interarm contrast is comparable to unity , the disk response is likely non - linear , and one can not fit the perturber parameters ( @xmath26 and strength ) by simply exploring the wave pitch - angle and arm - interarm contrast independently .",
    "the fit thus needs to be undertaken through numerical simulations .",
    "the constraints discussed above can be used to estimate the best set of parameters for an external tidal perturber . in the second part of this paper ,",
    "in which we investigate the behavior of a @xmath53 disk , the parameter space to be explored is different .",
    "it should also be noted that most of the torque from the perturbing potential is received by the disk at the inner and outer lindblad resonances , where @xmath54 .",
    "the radial profile of the perturbing potential should thus only have a minor impact on the disk response .",
    "this greatly simplifies the exploration of parameter space , as it is not required to have a precise prescription of the perturber s shape and potential ( unavailable anyway ) , and its strength can be adjusted simply by an adequate scaling ( e.g.  scaling the mass of a bar - like perturber or the triaxiality of a triaxial halo ) . unfortunately",
    ", this simultaneously prevents any attempt to reach a detailed knowledge of the perturber s structure .      for an infinitely thin disk , the observed ( i.e.  line - of - sight ) velocity field of the gas flow",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath55\\sin i,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the radial and azimuthal components of the velocity in the galactocentric rest frame , @xmath58 is the inclination , and @xmath43 and @xmath59 are , respectively , the azimuth of the fluid element under consideration and of the observer .",
    "the notation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : notation ] .",
    "although the origin of azimuth can be chosen arbitrarily , it is traditionally chosen along the major axis of the galactic disk , on the receding side .",
    "for this choice of origin , @xmath60 . as the velocity field associated with an @xmath21-folded density wave has an intrinsic @xmath61 dependence in azimuth , one can easily see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vrad ] ) that it will lead to @xmath62 and @xmath63 folded signatures in the deprojected perturbed velocity field .",
    "thus , the perturbed velocity field associated with an @xmath30 spiral will have @xmath64 and @xmath65 signatures when deprojected , and these can in principle be used to constrain the models .",
    "@xcite showed that the weights of the @xmath65 to @xmath64 deprojected components increase steeply across corotation .",
    "this is true if the @xmath64 component of the observed velocity field comes only from the @xmath30 spiral pattern .",
    "however , in the case of , which is likely warped , this property does not hold and , as we shall see , we prefer to discard the @xmath64 information .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the observed velocity information to reconstruct the velocity field of , and they underlined the important role of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 coefficients .",
    "the @xmath64 component of the deprojected velocity field can come from an @xmath30 perturbation to the velocity , but also from the @xmath66 component , i.e.  the unperturbed circular rotation of the galactic disk .",
    "as soon as the inclination of the disk varies with radius , it is not possible to disentangle which fraction of the @xmath64 deprojected velocity comes from an @xmath30 density wave and which fraction comes from a warp .",
    "this corresponds to the infamous bias introduced in warped tilted ring models by so - called streaming motions , in this case horizontal @xmath30 perturbed velocities .",
    "since the disk of may be warped @xcite , the @xmath64 component of the deprojected velocity field is not a suitable constraint for the simulations , and we will rather focus on the @xmath65 component .",
    "we thus neglect the possible warp of , but this not expected to alter significantly our conclusions , either qualitatively or quantitatively .",
    "the @xmath65 component of the deprojected velocity field can come from an @xmath30 perturbation to the velocity , such as an @xmath30 spiral density wave , as well as from an @xmath67 wave ( which has @xmath65 and @xmath68 signatures ) .",
    "it can also arise from a wrong evaluation of the inclination ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "an error @xmath69 on the inclination will lead to a @xmath70 @xmath64 residual , but also to a weak @xmath71 @xmath65 residual .",
    "although the @xmath65 residual coming from an inclination error is weak ( @xmath72 ) , it is important to compare it with the @xmath65 residual coming from the bar or spiral perturbation , which is also small .",
    "[ fig : m=3_raverage ] shows the radius - averaged value of this component as a function of the assumed inclination of the disk of ( @xcite used @xmath73 ) .",
    "the solid line represents a second order polynomial fit to the data .",
    "one can easily check that the fit scales as @xmath74 , as expected .",
    "[ fig : m=3_rprofiles ] shows the amplitude of the @xmath65 component of the deprojected velocity field ( hereafter called @xmath75 ) as a function of radius , for three special values of the assumed inclination : 550 ( corresponding to the lowest data point in fig .",
    "[ fig : m=3_raverage ] ) , 539 ( corresponding to the fit minimum ) , and 527 ( corresponding to the shape of the outermost isodensity contours , assuming circularity ) .",
    "these profiles do not markedly differ from each other , showing that the small uncertainty on the disk inclination has little impact on @xmath76 .",
    "a warp could affect this profile in a similar fashion to inclination uncertainty , but again the impact on the profile s shape should be minimal .",
    "we thus consider @xmath76 an appropriate constraint for the simulations , where the equivalent profile @xmath77 is easily constructed .",
    "the @xmath76 constraint is implemented as follows : we define the scalar product between two radial functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 as @xmath80 and then search for the maximum of the function @xmath81^\\frac12 } \\label{eq : chi}\\ ] ] in both time @xmath82 and observer azimuth @xmath59 ( @xmath83 depends on @xmath59 ) , while keeping the inclination fixed at @xmath84 . by construction",
    ", @xmath85 is always smaller than one , and it is exactly one if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are proportional ( schwarz s theorem )",
    ". the closer @xmath85 is to unity , the more similar @xmath76 and @xmath77 are . in the linear regime",
    ", @xmath86 is independent of the amplitude of the perturbing potential , which can thus be optimized in a second step , matching @xmath87 to @xmath76 in both shape and absolute value .",
    "it must be noted that the perturber s amplitude can be adjusted either by matching the amplitude of the perturbed velocity ( i.e.  @xmath87 ) or by matching the amplitude of the perturbed density ( i.e.the arm - interarm contrast ) . as indicated above",
    ", we adopted the first procedure .",
    "naturally , the disk response should also match the perturbed density amplitude or the model must be discarded .",
    "the ratio of the perturbed velocity amplitude to the perturbed density amplitude depends not only on the wave frequency but also on the disk parameters .",
    "given the simplifying assumptions made , we do not require a perfect simultaneous match , but simply that the arm - interarm contrast resembles the one observed .",
    "we also note that the @xmath88-weighting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar_product ] ) corresponds to a uniform weighting of the 2d deprojected map , and that the deprojected beam is elongated parallel to the minor axis at all points .",
    "the effect of beam smearing s resulting @xmath30 modulation on @xmath76 is not taken into account by our analysis , but it is likely to be small compared to the @xmath65 component we are interested in .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar_product ] ) should also have a lower limit at approximately one beam width . in practice ,",
    "@xmath88-weighting and beam smearing tend to quash any @xmath89 component at the center and thus make the integrand negligible for @xmath90 .",
    "one can therefore adopt either choice of lower limit .",
    "we have now outlined how to take into account the constraints arising from the zeroth and first moments of the data cube ( i.e.the column density and velocity fields ) .",
    "the second moment ( i.e.  the velocity dispersion field ) is directly imposed to the model as the ( azimuthally averaged ) sound speed profile .",
    "we have also performed runs with a uniform sound speed @xmath91  km  s@xmath7 , as often observed in the outer parts of dwarfs , because the large central velocity dispersion could be partly due to beam smearing .",
    "the hydrodynamic code used is a simple 2d eulerian finite difference program on a polar mesh written from scratch by one of us , and formerly used in another astrophysical context ( protoplanet  protoplanetary disk tidal interactions ) .",
    "the mesh is staggered , that is to say the vertically integrated pressure and the surface density are zone centered , while the radial ( resp .",
    "azimuthal ) velocity is defined at the interface between two radially ( resp .",
    "azimuthally ) neighboring zones .",
    "the code solves discrete versions of the continuity and euler equations , the different terms of which are treated sequentially through an operator splitting technique in much the same way as is done in zeus @xcite .",
    "the algorithms used enforce mass and angular momentum conservation ( for an isolated system ) up to the computer accuracy .",
    "the advection is based on a second order upstream difference @xcite .",
    "there is no energy equation as the closure relation is provided by the observed velocity dispersion , treated here as the sound speed .",
    "this ensures that at any instant the simulated disk has a sound speed coinciding with the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "the drawback is that the disk quickly fragments into clumps at low @xmath19 .",
    "this does not happen in our externally forced disks , however , as the surface density is low .",
    "for our heavy disk models , where the gas surface density is scaled up , a work - around is discussed in   [ sec : heavy_disks ] .",
    "as mentioned above , since beam smearing can result in an overestimated dispersion near the center , several velocity dispersion profiles have been tried with central values lower than observed .",
    "they all gave very similar results , except for the disk response near the center , which displays a relatively smooth but complex behavior at large @xmath13 and relatively strong shocks and a higher accretion rate onto the center for @xmath92  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "these differences are of negligible importance , however , both in term of the @xmath86 value ( our scalar product gives a small weight to the central parts by construction ) or in terms of the beam convolved - synthetic maps . to relieve the courant condition and",
    "increase the time step , azimuthal advection is treated so as to get rid of the average azimuthal velocity at each radius @xcite . in our case , however , the gain provided is relatively small since we have to deal with strong radial streaming at the center , where the disk response is bar - like .",
    "as we use a 2d code , we effectively neglect the galaxy warp .    for our external perturber models ,",
    "the forcing is provided either by a bar or by a triaxial halo .",

    "@xmath98 is the bar density profile along its major axis , given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the bar central surface density and @xmath101 its scalelength .",
    "the bar potential is thus entirely determined by the set of parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath97 , and the total mass of the bar @xmath103 while its time behavior is determined by the pattern speed @xmath26 .",
    "the exponential bar profile does not have a cut - off radius and the quadrupole term arising from it has a power - law rather than an exponential behavior .",
    "the bar elements located at @xmath104 nevertheless contribute negligibly to the bar potential itself , which is dominated by the contribution of the inner parts .",
    "we reemphasize that the detailed characteristics of the bar are unimportant for the disk tidal response ( see   [ sec : method_i ] ) . the crude bar description provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : barsd ] ) is thus sufficient for our purposes .",
    "in addition to the axisymmetric part of the bar potential , another @xmath66 potential is applied to the disk in all of the bar forcing runs , so as to match the circular velocity curve . it can be interpreted as due to a spherical halo ( which can not drive a wake in the disk ) .",
    "the triaxial halo models are characterized by the halo pattern speed @xmath26 and the ratio of the tangential to radial acceleration of an embedded test particle .",
    "the tangential acceleration has an @xmath30 dependence in azimuth and the acceleration ratio was chosen either constant in radius or with dependences similar to the ones shown in fig .",

    "we have adopted the latter .",
    "this is not a problem , however , as the simulations are not demanding on modern , cheap platforms , and the flow remains symmetric .",
    "contrary to our standard procedure ( see   [ sec : method_s ] ) , the velocity dispersion for these runs was set to @xmath130  km  s@xmath7 everywhere . as discussed above , a first series of runs using the observed velocity dispersion profile showed a non bar - like response and complex spiral structures in the center .",

    "[ fig : barruns1][fig : barruns3 ] .",
    "the observed rise of the velocity dispersion in the central part of the galaxy could then be assigned to beam smearing , as the beam there intercepts kinematically independent regions , but this is rather unlikely ( see   4.2 and 5.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the high central dispersion is almost certainly due to the burst of star formation .",
    "it may thus be that the central gas dynamics can not be properly modeled with an isothermal gas , the sound speed of which corresponds to the observed velocity dispersion , or simply that the gas dynamics near the center is not dominated by the tidal forcing of a relatively slow , large - scale perturber .",

    "the nature of this unseen perturber is problematic , however , as a triaxial halo is unlikely to precess that fast , and the nature of a hypothetic bar that would otherwise act as a driver is unclear .",
    "because the good agreements between the arm - interarm contrast , the @xmath65 velocity perturbation amplitude and shape , and the bar position angle strongly support the observed spiral structure being a coherent grand - design pattern , and because the pattern speed of this spiral is both observationally and numerically constrained to have its corotation relatively close to the disk edge , it is tempting to suggest a global disk instability as an alternative explanation for the observed spiral structure .",

    "the underlying idea of their work is that most of the matter in disks is in the form of unseen cold molecular hydrogen .",
    "the disks are close to the threshold of jeans instability and can develop some global disk gravitational spiral instability endowing them with a spiral structure at large scale , while at small scale they fragment into clumps inside which smaller scale fragmentation occurs , recursively , until a cut - off scale is reached ( the `` clumpuscule '' scale ) .",

    "the spatial and temporal dynamic ranges required from the simulations make it far beyond access of present computing resources , and one can only address the problem partially . here , we tackle the problem of the global structure of a massive disk by starting with an axisymmetric disk at equilibrium , to which a small @xmath30 seed is added .",

    "we stress that any @xmath67 spiral density wave would have an effect on the @xmath65 deprojected velocity field , so that the simulated @xmath267 profile could arise from a mixture of @xmath30 and @xmath67 waves . in this run , however , we find that the outer spiral structure is the superposition of two @xmath30 spiral density waves with different pattern speeds .",
    "the main wave has @xmath132  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 , consistent with the direct measurement of @xcite , and corresponding to a corotation close to the disk edge .",
    "the second wave has @xmath268  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 but is not well determined , as the perturbed density power spectrum deduced from the simulation is relatively noisy .",
    "not surprisingly given our motivations for doing so , we find that scaling up the gas surface density of gives rise to a well - developed spiral pattern .",
    "our heavy disk model also provides a satisfactory fit to s column density map and velocity perturbations .",
    "the corrected scaling factor @xmath269 we obtain is in good agreement with those derived for a variety of spiral galaxies , where typical values are @xmath270 with a tail at larger values ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xmath271 ) .",
    "@xcite obtains slightly lower factors for his sample of ( gas - rich ) late - type dwarfs , but again a tail of high values is present .",
    "we note however that the above values are normally determined by attempting to fit the circular velocity curve only ( with a scaled - up + he disk and a stellar component with free @xmath221 ) , while our goals here differ and we allow for an extra dark halo .",
    "such circular velocity curve fitting would yield a scaling factor of about @xmath272 for ( neglecting the stellar component , which is safe here ) , but as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : massfraction ] it would poorly reproduce the total circular velocity .",
    "wiggles in the predicted circular velocity curve are not present in the observed one , requiring a smoother dark disk material distribution for improved fitting .",
    "furthermore , in , the scaling factor obtained from the circular velocity curve is much higher than that obtained from the requirement of spiral structure sustainability , and the resulting disk would be violently unstable to axisymmetric perturbations ( see below ) .",
    "this strongly argues for the presence of a classical ( i.e.  spherical or near - spherical ) dark matter halo in addition to any realistic massive disk . a similar argument could be made based on the number of spiral arms in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , a circular velocity curve remaining flat significantly outside of the observed range would normally make the fit of a scaled - up gaseous disk alone progressively more difficult , but this is not the case here as the circular velocity curve predicted from the is still slightly rising in the outer parts .",
    "the adopted scaling of the gas surface density brings the disk of close to the critical value of the toomre parameter , for which the disk is unstable to axisymmetric modes and fragments ( @xmath273 for a vertically resolved disk ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the surface density profile of with @xcite s ( @xcite ) threshold for the onset of star formation , as the disk is not observed to form stars .",
    "kennicutt s critical surface density is defined by @xmath274 where @xmath275 .",
    "this critical surface density corresponds to the marginal stability of a thin gas layer embedded in a more massive , thicker stellar disk to two - component ( fluid and collisionless ) axisymmetric instabilities ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if we adapt this criterion ( marginal stability ) to the present situation , for which @xmath276 and @xmath273 , the critical surface density becomes @xmath277 we note that although our scaling adds another fluid to the disk of , it is indistinguishable from the as the same sound speed is assumed , and we recover the one - fluid stability criterion .",
    "indeed ( see e.g.  the @xmath278 dotted line in fig .  3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the stability criterion reads @xmath279 ( where we replaced @xmath234 by @xmath280 to account for the vertical thickness ) , leading to @xmath281 and to eq .",
    "( [ eq : keni2 ] ) , where @xmath282 refers to the _ total _",
    "( i.e.  dark matter + ) disk surface density .",
    "the two critical surface densities given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : keni1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : keni2 ] ) are compared with that inferred from our best match heavy disk model in fig .",
    "[ fig : keni ] , where we use the observed velocity dispersion profile @xmath283 . according to the standard criterion",
    "( also used by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the disk would be expected to form stars at almost all radii , whereas according to the modified criterion it is not expected to form stars at all .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , however , since the modified criterion comes from the same marginal stability argument underlying our massive disk models , where we simply scaled up the observed gas surface density , approaching the limit of gravitational instability without ever reaching it .",
    "the correction factor @xmath126 used to infer the surface density of a vertically resolved disk is the same as the marginally ( un)stable @xmath19 value for a vertically resolved gaseous disk , explaining why the heavy disk surface density profile is everywhere close to but smaller than @xmath284 .",
    "the non - prediction of star formation within @xmath285  kpc , even with the standard threshold , should not be taken too seriously since we have neglected the stellar component of , which extends to about 3  kpc @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the scaling factor @xmath269 inferred from our heavy disk models depends on the assumed distance @xmath286 to .",
    "since the observed toomre @xmath19 parameter scales as @xmath287 , a smaller scaling ratio would be needed if the galaxy were further than estimated by @xcite ( @xcite ; our adopted distance of @xmath288  mpc ) .",
    "however , an order of magnitude increase in the distance would be needed to reach @xmath289 , which seems highly unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , an improved distance determination would be helpful , for example from cepheids or the tip of the red giant branch with hst .",
    "@xcite discussed in detail the issue of s distance .",
    "while she considers an increase of the distance by a factor of @xmath144 unlikely but possible , her arguments would completely reject an increase by a factor of @xmath1 .",
    "we also stress that @xmath19 , and thus @xmath233 , also depend on the assumed velocity dispersion of the additional disk material . for the sake of simplicity and in order to keep our parameter space as small as possible , we have assumed that the unseen material is tightly linked to the observed and has the same velocity dispersion and ( consistently ) the same vertical extent .",
    "less additional material would be needed if it had a lower velocity dispersion .",
    "indeed , the ratio @xmath290 ( or @xmath291 ) is degenerate in the expression of @xmath19 . a change of order unity in @xmath292",
    "would also be expected to account for two - component axisymmetric ( in)stability , and other two - components instabilities may develop @xcite .",
    "we have performed 2d hydrodynamic simulations of the galaxy in order to find a plausible explanation for the spiral structure observed in its extended disk .",
    "we have explored two main hypotheses : i ) the observed bar / spiral structure is excited by an external driver , which we assume to be either a rotating bar or triaxial halo , and ii ) the observed structure is due to a gravitational instability in the disk , which would contain an important unseen component and be much more massive than currently inferred from observations . in the first case , the free parameters are the external driver pattern frequency and strength ( bar mass or halo triaxiality ) .",
    "our results constrain the pattern frequency to @xmath131  km  s@xmath7  kpc@xmath7 and the bar mass and halo axis ratio to @xmath293  @xmath123  and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "however , based on current structure formation simulations , it is unlikely that a triaxial halo would have such a fast figure rotation ( the spin parameter @xmath0 is too large ) , while the mass required for the bar is at least an order of magnitude larger than the optical mass of the central galaxy .",
    "all our external driver models also fail to reproduce the small spiral arms pitch angle observed in the outer disk .",
    "the external perturber model is thus implausible and we do not favor it . in the heavy disk case , the only free parameter is the disk surface density scaling ratio .",
    "we found that a ( corrected ) scaling ratio of about @xmath1 leads to a spiral instability adequately accounting for the disk spiral structure and non - circular motions : the spiral pitch angle and arm - interarm contrast are accurately reproduced .",
    "the scaling ratio is well constrained by the simulations and the main uncertainty arises from the correction factor of the perturbed potential ( to account for finite thickness ) . a scaling ratio of @xmath1 yields roughly the same amount of disk matter and halo dark matter over the disk radius while the halo dominates further out .",
    "this is consistent with recent @xmath161cdm structure formation simulations .",
    "furthermore , given that the heavy disk model reproduces the perturbed velocities and leads to a redistribution of angular momentum , an external triaxial potential is not required to explain the fueling of the central bcd starburst .",
    "even for such a heavy disk , @xcite s ( @xcite ) star formation criterion is valid and accounts for the absence of star formation in the disk of , provided it reads as @xmath294 , where @xmath223 is the critical value of the toomre parameter for the onset of jeans instability .",
    "as the disk of does not lie in the equatorial plane of a more massive , thicker stellar disk , the expression of @xmath223 is different from that of standard galactic gaseous disks .    throughout this work ,",
    "we have neglected a possible warp in , we have assumed that the observed velocity dispersion could be adequately modeled as the sound speed of an isothermal gas , and we have not considered the small - scale clumpy structure present at the beam scale in the observations .",
    "we have also assumed , respectively , a unique external driver pattern frequency and a uniform disk surface density scaling ratio , in order to keep the dimensionality of our parameter space as small as possible . as such",
    ", our study is exploratory in nature .",
    "this might in turn lead to too crude a description of , and relaxing one or several of these assumptions may be required to improve the fit . for our heavy disk models",
    ", we also assumed a non - responsive spherically symmetric halo , whereas the disk mass is comparable to the halo mass within its radius . considering a live halo thus appears a priority for any further similar modeling .",
    "it should in particular improve the fit to the observed central bar - like structure , where our current model fails .",
    "although we favor the heavy disk model over an external perturber , both models fail to reproduce satisfactorily the gas response in the center .",
    "perturber models can loosely reproduce the bar - like feature observed but are unable to account for the kinematic twists , while heavy disk models simply fail to generate bar - like structures .",
    "the complexity of the central dynamics is in any case probably much greater than our models allow , and it is likely for instance that a different forcing frequency has to be considered for the central regions . in addition , the heavy disk models do not include any interaction or feedback from the stars , which could initiate the bar - like response . despite a poor description of the central regions , we emphasize that a satisfactory description of the outer disk ( @xmath295  kpc ) is obtained , simultaneously in terms of perturbed velocity and perturbed density , with a very restricted set of adjustable parameters ( @xmath144 in the forced runs , @xmath234 for the heavy disks ) .",
    "furthermore , only the heavy disk models properly account for the observed small pitch angle of the spiral arms .",
    "this strong constraint thus favors this latter set of models .",
    "if one adopts the massive disk interpretation , appears as an aborted optical grand - design spiral because its gas layer has not reached the critical surface density for star formation .",
    "the spiral pattern is nevertheless present because the surface density is _ just _ under this threshold .",
    "we recall however that there is a degeneracy between the surface density and velocity dispersion of the dark disk material .",
    "a long - standing and possibly related issue is how the velocity dispersion can remain at @xmath296  km  s@xmath7 in the outer disk , without any obvious thermal or mechanical energy source .",
    "in particular , the question whether the observed spiral density wave could constitute a sufficient heating source for the disk material should be addressed ( whether due to an external driver or to a gravitationally unstable massive disk ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that if , in any isolated object , the increased disk surface density required to explain the existence of a spiral pattern were to over - predict the observed circular velocity curve , then disk dark matter ( exclusively ) could be ruled out as the source of that pattern , leaving a rotating triaxial halo as the most likely source .",
    "undisturbed lsb galaxies which are not dark matter dominated and show a clear spiral structure would be ideal candidates for such a test . however , it is not clear whether such objects exist .",
    "spiral - based scaling factors in lsb galaxies generally produce maximum disk velocities that are high but still within the maximum allowed by the circular velocity curve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
