    "at zero temperature , the properties of a quantum many - body system are dictated by the structure of its ground state .",
    "the degree of complexity of this structure varies from system to system .",
    "it ranges from exceptionally simple cases e.g . when an intense magnetic field aligns all the spins of a ferromagnet along its direction , producing a product or unentangled state to more intricate situations where entanglement pervades the ground state of the system .",
    "thus , entanglement appears naturally in low temperature quantum many - body physics , and it is at the core of relevant quantum phenomena , such as superconductivity  @xcite , quantum hall effect  @xcite and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "there are several good reasons to study entanglement in quantum many - body systems . on the one hand , over the last decade entanglement",
    "has been realized to be a crucial resource to process and send information in novel ways @xcite .",
    "it is , for instance , the key ingredient in quantum information tasks such as quantum teleportation and superdense coding , and it also appears in most proposed algorithms for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "this has triggered substantial experimental efforts to produce entanglement in engineered quantum systems @xcite .",
    "consequently , one may want to investigate and characterize entanglement in those systems where it appears in a natural way , with a view either to extract it to process quantum information or else to gain insight into physical mechanisms that can be used to entangle a large number of quantum systems .",
    "but one can also motivate these studies without referring to potential applications of entanglement as a resource in quantum information processing .",
    "the ground state of a typical quantum many - body system consists of a superposition of a huge number of product states . understanding this structure is equivalent to establishing how subsystems are interrelated , which in turn is what determines many of the relevant properties of the system . in this sense , the study of multipartite entanglement offers an attractive theoretical framework from which one may be able to go beyond customary approaches to the physics of quantum collective phenomena @xcite .",
    "most promisingly , a theory of entanglement in quantum many - body systems may also lead to the development of new numerical techniques . in particular",
    ", recent results @xcite show how to efficiently simulate certain quantum systems through a suitable parametrization of quantum superpositions .",
    "in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of entanglement in several one - dimensional spin models , expanding and complementing the results of ref .",
    "the models we discuss fulfill a convenient combination of requirements : they are solvable the ground state can be computed by using well - known analytical and numerical techniques and at the same time they successfully describe a rich spectrum of physical phenomena , which include ordered and disordered magnetic phases connected by a quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the paper has been divided into five more sections .",
    "a brief summary of them follows .",
    "the study of entanglement in a system with many particles can be approached in several complementary ways @xcite . in section [ sec : measure ] we briefly review some of them and explain the specific aspect on which we focus here .",
    "we consider a quantum spin chain in its ground state .",
    "our aim is to determine the degree of entanglement between a _",
    "block _ of spins and the rest of the chain , as measured by the von neumann entropy of the block , and to investigate how this entanglement grows with the size of the block .",
    "sections [ sec : xy ] and [ sec : xxz ] are devoted , respectively , to computing the entropy of a spin block for the xy model and for the xxz model .",
    "the calculation is divided into two parts .",
    "first , we need to construct the ground state of the spin chain , which for general chains is a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "fortunately , the xy model can be treated analytically in the limit of an infinite chain @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the xxz model there are known techniques @xcite ) to easily cope with chains consisting of up to twenty spins .",
    "then , from the ground state of each model we extract the entropy of a spin block . for the xy model",
    "this is shown to build down to diagonalizing a matrix whose dimensions grow only quadratically with the size of the block . in this way we compute the entanglement for blocks of up to several hundreds of spins . in the xxz model ,",
    "instead , we only consider blocks of up to ten qubits , but the results can already be convincingly interpreted as an independent confirmation of the conclusions drawn from the xy model .    in section [ sec : scaling ]",
    "we discuss the findings of the previous two sections , that can be summarized as follows :    * off a critical point , the entanglement of a block of spins with the chain a function that turns out to grow monotonically with the number of spins in the block achieves a finite _ saturation _ value for sufficiently large blocks .",
    "* at a _ quantum phase transition _ , instead , the entropy of a block of spins grows unboundedly .",
    "more specifically , the entropy for a critical chain grows logarithmically in the size of the spin block , with a multiplicative coefficient that depends only on the universality class of the phase transition .",
    "that is , at the critical point entanglement obeys a _",
    "universal scaling law_.    interestingly , the behavior of the entanglement in a critical spin chain matches well - known results in conformal field theory , where the geometric entropy analogous to the spin - block entropy , but defined in the continuum has been computed for 1 + 1 dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "the geometric entropy grows logarithmically with the size of the interval under consideration and with a multiplicative constant given by the _",
    "central charge _ of the theory .",
    "as described in section [ sec : cft ] , a consistent picture arises . at a critical point",
    "the large - scale behavior of a spin chain is universal , with the quantum phase transition belonging to a given universality class .",
    "all long - range properties of the chain are then described by the conformal field theory associated with that universality class .",
    "in particular the entanglement between a large block of spins and the rest of the chain follows the same law as the geometric entropy .",
    "the above connection between entanglement and the geometric entropy of conformal theories has several implications .",
    "previous calculations of the entropy in higher dimensions indicate that in 2- and 3-dimensional spin lattices the entropy of a spin block grows as the size of the boundary of the block the same law holding both for critical and non - critical lattices .",
    "the lack of saturation of the entropy as a function of the size of the block explains the failure of the dmrg technique @xcite .",
    "thus , we interpret in terms of entanglement why this numerical technique so successful for non - critical spin chains deteriorates in critical one - dimensional lattices and fails to work properly both for critical and non - critical chains and in 2- and 3-dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "the scaling law obeyed by the entanglement of a critical ground state implies that the greater a spin block is , the more disordered or mixed its density matrix .",
    "thus , the entropy indicates an ordering of the reduced density matrices , according to how mixed they are .",
    "this ordering can be further refined and shown to actually emerge from majorization relations between the reduced density matrices .    finally , we translate the results related to the c - theorem @xcite to quantum information .",
    "entanglement is argued to decrease along renormalization group trajectories .",
    "a number of numerical and analytical results are consistent with the idea that irreversibility of renormalization group flows may be rooted on a majorization ordering of the vacuum density matrices along the flow .",
    "a major difficulty in studying the entanglement in a many - body quantum system comes from the fact that the number of degrees of freedom involved grows exponentially with the number of interacting subsystems . in particular , the task of computing explicitly the ground state of a chain consisting of a large number of spins , to then analyze its entanglement properties , turns out to be very difficult , if not insurmountable .",
    "fortunately , for some specific spin models the ground state has been previously computed .",
    "one can then try to characterize entanglement in these models .",
    "this is again a rather ambitious enterprise . on the one hand",
    ", it entails serious computational difficulties , since the corresponding ground states , when expressed in a local basis , still involve exponentially many coefficients . on",
    "the other hand such characterization is also challenging from a conceptual viewpoint .",
    "the study of entanglement of a large number of particles is a relatively unexplored subject and it has not yet even been established what aspects of a ground state a sensible characterization should consider .",
    "therefore , an important part of the problem is to actually identify which quantities may be of interest .",
    "this section is devoted to describe and motivate our particular approach , which attempts to characterize the ground state of the spin chain through the spectral properties of the reduced density matrix for a block of spins , and in particular through its entropy .",
    "we start by presenting some generalities and reviewing previous work .",
    "a state @xmath0 of @xmath1 spins is entangled if it can not be written as the tensor product of single - spin states , .",
    "product states depend on @xmath2 parameters and are therefore just a subset of zero measure in the set of states of @xmath1 spins . a generic entangled state , when expressed in a local basis ,",
    "depends on @xmath3 parameters .",
    "characterizing entanglement is about identifying a reduced subset of parameters that are particularly relevant from a physical or computational point of view .      in recent years",
    "a quantitative theory of bipartite entanglement has been developed . as proposed in the pioneering work by bennett , bernstein , popescu and schumacher @xcite , this theory",
    "is based on the possibility of converting one entangled state @xmath4 into another entangled state @xmath5 by applying local operations on each of the subsystems and communicating classically , a set of transformations denoted as locc ( see @xcite for extensive reviews ) .",
    "the basic idea is that if the state @xmath4 can be converted into the state @xmath5 by locc , [ eq : psipsi ] then @xmath4 can not be less entangled than @xmath5 , since locc can only introduce classical correlations between the subsystems .",
    "local convertibility can in this way be used to compare the amount of entanglement in different states .    following these ideas two remarkably simple characterizations of pure - state entanglement",
    "are possible for systems with @xmath6 subsystems :    ( @xmath7 ) bennett et al .",
    "@xcite showed that , in an asymptotic sense , any entangled state @xmath8 of two particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 is equivalent ( that is , reversibly convertible by locc ) to some fraction @xmath11 of an epr state , ( _ a_b + _",
    "a_b ) . here",
    "entropy of entanglement _",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath12 for any one of the systems , e ( ) -(_a_2 _ a ) .",
    "[ eq : entofent ]    ( @xmath13 ) nielsen @xcite subsequently showed that deterministic conversions of a single copy of @xmath4 into @xmath5 by locc are ruled by the majorization relation ( to be introduced later in eq .",
    "( [ eq : majo ] ) ) .",
    "more general locc transformations are similarly ruled by a finite set of _ entanglement monotones _ @xcite .",
    "the optimal local manipulation of a bipartite system in a pure state is presently well understood .",
    "bipartite pure - state entanglement can be characterized by a single measure @xmath11 in the asymptotic regime and by a small set of entanglement monotones in the single - copy case . however",
    ", none of these results has been successfully generalized to systems with @xmath14 subsystems subsystems has a simple explanation , at least for single - copy conversions .",
    "the most allowing scenario for local manipulation of entanglement in the single - copy regime is that of stochastic local operations slo , where the conversion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psipsi ] ) is only required to succeed with some non - vanishing probability . clearly , if a conversion is not possible by slo , then it is also not possible by locc .",
    "but for systems with @xmath15 subsystems ( and with the exceptional case of three qubits ) , two randomly chosen states @xmath4 and @xmath5 are generically unconnected by slo @xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the total number of parameters accessible to local manipulation grows linearly with the number @xmath1 of subsystems ( the most general slo operation can be implemented by a single measurement on each subsystem ) , whereas @xmath4 and @xmath5 depend on exponentially many parameters . ] . in spite of the remarkable success achieved for bipartite systems",
    ", locc transformations do not seem to be a good a guidance to comprehensively characterize multipartite entanglement ( or a series of quantum states @xmath16 involving an increasing number of particles @xmath1 ) by only two - particle unitary operations .",
    "the entanglement of states @xmath17 and @xmath18 would be comparable if , say , it only takes poly(@xmath1 ) two - particle operations to interconvert them .",
    "parameter counting shows that one can then distinguish between the class of states that can be produced with poly(@xmath1 ) two - particle operations and , for instance , those requiring exp(@xmath1 ) operations .",
    "alternatively , one can study the computational cost of classically simulating the state of a many - body quantum system and its dynamics @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is to consider how entanglement is affected by a change of scale in the system . ] .",
    "nevertheless , the above results can still be used to characterize any _ bipartite _ aspects of the entanglement in a multipartite system , and therefore will be sufficing for the purposes of this paper .",
    "the study of entanglement in condensed matter systems was initiated by nielsen @xcite .",
    "he originally analyzed two interacting spins in the heisenberg model with an external magnetic field and studied how entanglement depends on the temperature and the intensity of the spin - spin interaction and magnetic field .",
    "in his calculations , nielsen used wooters concurrence @xcite , a measure of mixed - state entanglement defined for two - qubit systems .",
    "more recently , several other authors have also studied the concurrence in spin systems .",
    "wooters @xcite has studied the maximal nearest neighbor concurrence that an infinite , translationally invariant spin chain can have , a result extended by oconnor and wooters @xcite to finite spin rings .",
    "furthermore , concurrence in the two - spin heisenberg model has been reanalyzed by arnesen , bose and vedral @xcite .",
    "gunlycke , bose , kendon and vedral @xcite have considered a ring of several spins with ising interaction and external magnetic field , and studied how two - spin entanglement depended on the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "wang , fu , solomon @xcite have studied the anisotropic heisenberg model with three spins . for a heisenberg ring of @xmath1 spins , wang and zanardi",
    "@xcite have expressed the nearest neighbor concurrence in terms of the internal energy of the ring and analyzed the violation of bell inequalities , and wang @xcite has investigated the concurrence in the xx model . ref .",
    "@xcite contains some other related works .",
    "osterloh , amico , falci and fazio @xcite and osborne and nielsen @xcite have recently studied entanglement in the ground state of an infinite xy and ising spin chains and its relation to quantum phase transitions .",
    "more specifically , they have computed the concurrence between pairs of spins , for different choices of the pair . for the ising model with transverse magnetic field",
    ", the concurrence at nearest and next to nearest neighbors has a maximum near the critical point .",
    "osterloh et al .",
    "have suggestively noticed that there seems to be some form of universal scaling in the derivative of the concurrence of nearest neighboring spins , and similarly for the second derivative of the next to nearest neighbors .",
    "a notable fact is that the concurrence seems to disappear at third nearest neighbors .",
    "as pointed out by osborne and nielsen , this can be interpreted in terms of the monogamy of entanglement @xcite . in practice , it can also be understood as a shortcoming for using a two - qubit measure in order to capture the global distribution of entanglement along the chain .      the approach we follow here has been proposed by vidal , latorre , rico and kitaev @xcite and , as previous works based on the concurrence , it is focussed on bipartite entanglement . but instead of analyzing the entanglement between two of the spins of the system , we consider a whole block of adjacent spins and study its entanglement with the rest of the chain .",
    "we are particularly interested in how the entanglement between the block and the chain depends on the size of the block . in this way",
    ", we expect to be able to explore the behavior of quantum correlations at different length scales and to capture the emergence of universal scaling at a quantum critical point . later on in this section",
    "we will further motivate our choice by referring to the relationship between entanglement and the efficiency of numerical schemes for the simulation of spin chains .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the ground state of a chain of @xmath1 spins and let @xmath20 , _ l_n - l , be the reduced density matrix for @xmath21 contiguous spins . in the models we shall discuss , the ground state @xmath19 is translationally invariant , so that @xmath20 does not depend on the position of the block of spins but only on its size @xmath21 . because the chain is in a pure state , all the information about the entanglement between the block of spins and the rest of the chain is contained in the eigenvalues of @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath20 is a pure state itself , then the block is unentangled from the chain .",
    "instead , if @xmath20 has many non - zero eigenvalues , this roughly indicates a lot of entanglement between the block and the chain . as a matter of fact , the whole spectrum sp@xmath22 is of interest , as we shall discuss shortly . for concreteness",
    ", however , we will mainly use a single function of the spectrum of @xmath20 , namely the von neumann entropy s_l- ( _ l _ 2_l ) , as a measure of entanglement .",
    "this choice corresponds to the _ entropy of entanglement _",
    "@xcite ( recall eq .",
    "( [ eq : entofent ] ) ) between the block and the rest of the chain .",
    "let us discuss some general properties of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath23 is positive by construction , s_l 0 ,   l=0,1 , , n , where for convenience we define @xmath24 . because the chain is in a pure state @xmath19 , the spectrum sp(@xmath20 ) of the reduced density matrix for a block of spins and the spectrum for the rest of the chain are the same . in particular",
    ", the two parts will also have the same entropy .",
    "recalling that the ground state @xmath19 is translationally invariant , we have s_l = s_n - l ,   l=0,1 , , n. in addition , @xmath23 is a concave function @xcite , s_l , [ eq : concavity ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this can be proved with the help of the strong subadditivity of the von neumann entropy  @xcite , s(abc ) + s(b ) s(ab ) + s(bc ) , [ eq : strongsub ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath27 are three subsystems and , say , @xmath28 denotes the entropy of @xmath29 , the joint state of systems @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath27 correspond to three adjacent blocks of our translational invariant spin chain , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 spins respectively .",
    "then we have s(abc ) & = & s_l+m + s(ab)=s(bc)&=&s_l + s(b)&=&s_l - m , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : strongsub ] ) reads s_l+m+s_l - m2s_l , from where eq .",
    "( [ eq : concavity ] ) follows .",
    "finally , we note that the above properties imply that @xmath23 does not decrease as a function of @xmath21 in the interval @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "in particular , in the limit of an infinite chain , @xmath33 , @xmath23 becomes a non - decreasing , concave function for all finite values of @xmath21 .",
    "it is possible to get extra insight into the properties of @xmath23 as a measure of entanglement by analyzing some particular cases , as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : entstates ] ) .",
    "we note first that @xmath23 is upper bounded by s_l \\{l , n - l } , [ eq : bound ] since @xmath20 is supported in a local space of dimension @xmath34 , whereas @xmath23 vanishes for all @xmath21 _ only _ for product ( i.e. unentangled ) states .",
    "the paradigmatic ghz state of @xmath1 spins or qubits , ( ^n + ^n ) , is often regarded as a maximally entangled state . however , from the present perspective it is only slightly entangled .",
    "indeed , the entropies of a block of spins are @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and are therefore far below the upper bound ( [ eq : bound ] ) .    here",
    "we will be concerned with the ground state @xmath19 of spin chains that are invariant under discrete translations by any number of sites .",
    "[ for finite chains , we will assume that the extremal spins are connected ( spin rings ) and will require invariance under circular translations .",
    "] one could expect that translational symmetry of @xmath19 implies a more restrictive bound for the values @xmath23 can achieve .",
    "however this is not the case , since stelmachovic et al .",
    "@xcite have found a translationally invariant state that saturates ( [ eq : bound ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of states that are invariant under all possible permutations of the spins .",
    "there the dimension @xmath37 of the symmetric subspace leads to the upper bound @xmath38 .",
    "finally , at a critical point the ground state may have some extra symmetries .",
    "in particular , it is known that in the large scale limit ( that is , for scales much larger than the distance between neighboring spins ) a critical spin chain is _",
    "conformal invariant_. we will explore the implications of this additional symmetry in section [ sec : cft ] .",
    "the ground state entropy for critical chains will turn out to grow as @xmath39 for some universal constant @xmath40 .      as mentioned above , the entanglement between a block of spins and the rest of the chain is a function of the spectrum sp@xmath22 of the reduced density matrix of the block .",
    "our ultimate aim is to characterize how this entanglement depends on the number @xmath21 of spins in the block .",
    "a main motivation for this is that in this way we hope to capture the emergence of universal scaling for entanglement at a quantum phase transition .",
    "therefore we would like to be able to compare the spectrum sp(@xmath20 ) for different values of @xmath21 .",
    "the entropy @xmath23 can be used for this purpose , for it establishes an order in the set of probability distributions equivalently , in the set of spectra of density matrices .",
    "for instance , we have mentioned above that the entropy @xmath23 is non - decreasing in the interval @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "we can now use this result to say that , according to the entropy , the entanglement of a block of spins and the rest of the chain monotonically increases with the size of the block ( for blocks smaller than half of the chain ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are other powerful tools to compare probability distributions , and by using them one may obtain a finer characterization of entanglement . in particular , a far more tight sense of ( partial ) ordering between probability distributions is established by the majorization relation @xcite , a set of inequalities that control the conversion of bipartite entanglement by locc in the single - copy scenario @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall that a given probability distribution @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 ) is majorized by another probability distribution @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 ) , denoted @xmath46 , when the following series of inequalities are simultaneously fulfilled : x_1 & & y_1 + x_1 + x_2 & & y_1 + y_2 + & & + x_1 + x_2 + + x_n & = & y_1 + y_2 + + y_n .",

    "we shall explore whether a majorization relation underlies the scaling behavior of the entropy @xmath23 at critical points .",
    "there are many aspects of the ground state of a spin chain that could be taken as a guide to characterize its entanglement .",
    "our choice can be motivated by the role the reduced density matrix @xmath20 of a block of spins plays in some numerical schemes .",
    "we finish this section by explaining how the spectrum sp@xmath22 of @xmath20 determines the efficiency of white s density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite and of a recently proposed simulation scheme for the simulation of quantum spin chains @xcite .",
    "white s dmrg method @xcite is a numerical technique that has brought an enormous progress in the study of one - dimensional quantum systems such as quantum spin chains .",
    "it allows to compute ground state energies and correlation functions with spectacular accuracy for non - critical spin chains .",
    "the dmrg method , however , loses its grip ( as many other methods ) near a critical point and fails to work for quantum spin lattices in two or three dimensions even away from the critical point @xcite . as recently explained by osborne and nielsen @xcite in the language of quantum information , the degree of performance of this method",
    "is directly related to the way it accounts for entanglement .",
    "let us consider a large spin chain and its ground state @xmath19 .",
    "the dmrg method is based on computing properties of @xmath19 by constructing an approximation to the reduced density matrix @xmath20 for a block of @xmath21 spins , for an increasing value of @xmath21 .",
    "this is done by retaining only the relevant degrees of freedom of the hilbert space associated to the block of spins .",
    "such degrees of freedom are given by the eigenvectors of @xmath20 with greatest weights or eigenvalues @xmath52 , that we assume decreasingly ordered , @xmath53   @xmath54 .",
    "notice that the spectrum sp(@xmath20 ) typically contains as many as @xmath55 relevant eigenvalues , in which case the computational cost of the dmrg method explodes as the block size @xmath21 grows .",
    "however , not all eigenvalues have the same weight , and a good approximation to @xmath20 may be significantly cheaper to achieve than the exact reduced density matrix .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the number of eigenvalues such that _ i=1^_l^ p_l^i 1 - ,  0 1 .",
    "that is , @xmath57 is an effective rank of @xmath20 , resulting from ignoring all the smallest eigenvalues that sum up less than @xmath58 .",
    "then , if we are willing to accept a degree of accuracy @xmath58 , the dmrg method need only retain @xmath57 eigenvectors of @xmath20 .",
    "the efficiency of the dmrg depends on how small @xmath57 is . in turn , @xmath56 depends on how fast the eigenvalues @xmath59 decay with @xmath7 or , relatedly , on the entanglement between the block of spins and the rest of the chain .",
    "a very spread spectrum , roughly equivalent to a lot of entanglement , translates into a large @xmath56 and a large computational cost . if , instead , the eigenvalues @xmath52 decay very fast with @xmath7 , implying that there is not much entanglement , then @xmath56 is small and so is the computational cost of the dmrg method .",
    "therefore , by studying the spectrum of @xmath20 , and in particular the effective rank @xmath56 , we may be able to assess how well the dmrg will perform for given values of the parameters ( external magnetic field , spin - spin interaction ) defining a particular spin model .    on the other hand the effective rank @xmath56 appears also as a decisive parameter in a recently proposed numerical scheme for the classical simulation of quantum spin chains @xcite .",
    "in this scheme the cost of the simulation is linear in the number @xmath1 of spins in the chain and grows as a small polynomial in @xmath60 , ^ _ l _ l^ , that is , polynomial in the maximal effective rank achieved for blocks of adjacent spins .    summarizing ,",

    "relatedly , correlations between increasingly distant spins decay exponentially , - ~(-l/ ) , where @xmath83 is the correlation length ( we take the distance between nearest spins as unit of distance ) . for non - critical chains , we find that the entropy @xmath23 , a growing function with the block size @xmath21 , is upper - bounded by a saturation value @xmath221 .",

    "we can conclude , therefore , that the entanglement between a block and the rest of an infinite spin chain has a fixed value for blocks larger than the correlation length @xmath83 .",
    "recall from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) that @xmath23 could in principle grow as much as @xmath21 .",

    "finally , in section [ sec : cft ] it will be argued that in @xmath229 dimensions , the entanglement between a @xmath230-dimensional block of @xmath231 spins and the rest of a critical spin lattice grows as @xmath232 .",
    "the same scaling is expected to apply to non - critical spin lattices .",

    "the study of entropy in systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom has received quite some attention in the context of quantum field theory and black hole physics .",
    "historically , the thermodynamics of a black hole lead to the bekenstein - hawking entropy ( see for instance @xcite .",
    "this entropy is associated to the counting of microscopic degrees of freedom inside the horizon and scales as the area of the black hole .",
    "some authors suggested that the origin of this entropy might be rooted in the loss of information forced upon an external observer by the existence of a horizon .",
    "although this point of view is no longer pursued , its analysis comes naturally due to the combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity which underlies the holographic principle .",
    "the field theoretical definition of entropy faces the traditional problem of renormalization in quantum field theory and receives the name of fine - grained entropy as well as geometric entropy .",
    "three computations of genuine quantum field theory entropy are worth recalling .",
    "first , srednicki  @xcite considered a properly regularized massless bosonic field theory in a universe which is divided by an imaginary sphere of radius @xmath234 into its inside and outside parts .",
    "he then numerically constructed the density matrix of the reduced outside system and found that its entropy scaled with an area law in 3 + 1 dimensions . for 1 + 1 dimensions , the scaling behavior of the entropy",
    "was found to be logarithmic .",
    "second , callan and wilczek  @xcite put forward the concept of geometric entropy in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "there , the power of conformal symmetry was used at full steam in order to compute the entropy of a conformal field theory when reduced to a finite geometry .",
    "we shall come back to this result shortly .",
    "finally , the third relevant computation was carried out by fiola , preskill , strominger and trivedi  @xcite who mapped a regularized field theory in 1 + 1 dimension to the rindler coordinates and recovered the logarithmic behavior of the microscopic entropy .",
    "all these computations needed an explicit ultraviolet regulator since quantum field theory contains infinitely many degrees of freedom .",
    "note that in our case spin chains come equipped with the intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff of the lattice spacing .",
    "although more restrictive in scope , the computation of the geometric entropy of a 1 + 1 dimensional field theory brings the advantage that the result is casted in terms of the parameters that classify conformal field theories .",

    "the central charge plays many roles in a conformal field theory .",
    "it was introduced above as the coefficient of a correlator of energy - momentum tensors , which means that it is an observable .",
    "the central charge also characterizes the response of a theory to a modification of the background metric where it is defined .",
    "specifically , the scale anomaly associated to the lack of scale invariance produced by a non - trivial background metric is 0t^_0 = - r where @xmath234 is the curvature of the background metric .",
    "this anomaly can also be seen as the emergence of a non - local effective action when the field theory modes are integrated in a curved background .",
    "the results we have found in our analysis match perfectly the geometric entropy computation . in the case of the xx and heisenberg critical spin chains the central charge is @xmath246 and the model falls into the free boson universality class .",
    "the critical ising model corresponds to a free fermion , thus @xmath247 .",
    "the central charge of the theory is seen to play the role of a measure of entanglement .",
    "the vacuum of a theory of free bosons is more entangled than the one corresponding to a theory of free fermions .",
    "scaling of entanglement is just another manifestation of the ubiquitous organizing principle orchestrated by conformal symmetry .",
    "the amount of surprise ( or entropy ) obtained when in a given theory a new degree of freedom ( a new spin in the block ) is added must follow scaling as dictated by the representation of conformal symmetry corresponding to that theory . because the entropy of the reduced density matrix of the ground state is not attached to any particular operator ,",
    "it is natural that the central charge is the parameter in control of this measure of entanglement .",
    "due to the relation between entanglement and the central charge a number of further connections appear .",
    "the central charge quantifies quantum correlations as well as _",

    "more relevant is how the theorem on irreversibility of renormalization group flows translates to entanglement in a way that will be discussed shortly .",
    "entanglement in spin chains obeys logarithmic scaling .",
    "this result was seen to emerge from conformal symmetry .",
    "it is then possible to apply similar arguments in higher dimensions and complete them with standard arguments based on the schmidt decomposition .",
