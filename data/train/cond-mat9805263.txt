    "systems in which polymerization takes place under condition of chemical equilibrium between the polymers and their respective monomers are termed `` equilibrium polymers '' ( ep ) . an important example is that of surfactant molecules forming long flexible cylindrical aggregates , so - called _ giant micelles _ ( gm)@xcite , which break and recombine constantly at random points along the sequence ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketchep ] ) .",
    "similar systems of ep are formed by liquid sulfur@xcite , selenium@xcite and some protein filaments@xcite . in the surfactant literature (",
    "e.g. @xcite ) giant micelles are often referred to as  living polymers \" although this is potentially confusing since they are distinct from systems that reversibly polymerize stepwise , in the presence of fixed number of initiators , for which this term has previously been reserved @xcite . as direct imaging methods clearly demonstrate@xcite gm , which behave very much like conventional polymer chains@xcite , may become very long indeed with contour lengths up to @xmath12",
    "however , the constant reversible scission of the chains offers an additional stress relaxation mechanism in comparison with conventional  quenched \" polymers whose identity is fixed for all time @xcite .",
    "ep are intrinsically polydisperse and their molecular weight distribution ( mwd ) in equilibrium is expected @xcite to follow an exponential decay with chain length .",
    "so far , we are not aware of any _ direct _ experimental measurements of the mwd in such systems .",
    "of central interest is the mean chain length , and for gm there has been experimental and theoretical controversy @xcite concerning its dependence on volume fraction , described by the growth exponent @xmath13 .",
    "a scaling theory ( summarized below ) gives @xmath14 ; although this is consistent with some data on ionic micelles at intermediate or high salt levels @xcite , a much larger exponent @xmath15 is suggested by experiments on lecithin - in - oil reverse micelles and some nonionic aqueous surfactants @xcite .",
    "thus the experimental evidence concerning the equilibrium growth law of gm remains controversial .",
    "given the shortcomings of any approximate analytical treatment and the difficulties with the laboratory measurements , numerical experiments , being exact within the framework of the respective model and able to account explicitly for various factors that influence experiments , should help much in understanding the thermodynamic behavior and the properties , both static and dynamic , of ep .",
    "however , up to now only a small number of simulational studies @xcite exist , in contrast to numerical experiments with conventional polymers .",
    "indeed , while the connectivity of polymer chains and the resulting slow dynamics render computer simulations a demanding task in its own terms , the scission - recombination processes , which are constantly underway in ep , impose additional problems for computational algorithms , mainly in terms of data organization and storage . since chains constantly break while other fragments unite into new chains , objects can lose their identity or gain new ones at each step of the simulation .    in earlier monte carlo ( mc ) simulations on ep@xcite",
    "the systems of polydisperse polymer chains were mapped onto an asymmetric potts model , in which different spin values were taken to represent bonded and nonbonded monomers as well as vacancies in a lattice .",
    "such models are very efficient for studying static properties of ep since at each update of the lattice all sites are assigned new spin values subject to a boltzmann probability ; dynamically however this violates the _ connectivity _ of the chains .",
    "accordingly this approach faithfully reproduces static properties , but since the kinetics of such models is fictitious these can not be extended to study dynamics which is one of our goals .    in a recent work by y.",
    "rouault and one of us , a dynamical monte carlo algorithm ( dmc ) was proposed@xcite , based on the highly efficient bond fluctuation model ( bfm)@xcite which is known to be very accurate in reproducing both static and dynamic properties ( rouse behavior ) of polymer chains in melts and solutions@xcite .",
    "however , the data structure used was based on a quenched polymer algorithm and was therefore rather slow and memory consuming ; a radical new approach is required .",
    "below we present a method to deal with these problems efficiently and are thereby able to study much larger systems .    in several ep systems ,",
    "the behavior is strongly affected by the presence of polymeric rings@xcite . for",
    "reasons that are not entirely clear however , ring - formation seem to be negligible in other cases , included that of gm .",
    "( this does not necessarily exclude a small number of closed loops in gm systems as may sometimes be seen using directimaging methods@xcite . )",
    "since the latter are among the most widely studied examples of ep , our results on the ring - free case are presented here .",
    "( this elaborates a brief previous discussion@xcite . )",
    "corresponding results on ep systems containing rings will be presented elsewhere@xcite . under some conditions gm systems",
    "can also contain branch points @xcite ; we forbid these in the present work .",
    "after recalling some analytical predictions in section  [ sec : theory ] we discuss our new approach in detail in section  [ sec : simulation ] . with this algorithm",
    "we are able to vary the volume fraction over nearly three orders of magnitude and we obtain equilibrated systems with average chain length up to about @xmath16 ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : phie ] ) .",
    "we present our computational results on static properties of ep without rings in section  [ sec : results ] . a complete crossover scaling analysis ranging from the dilute regime of swollen ep up to the dense gaussian limit",
    "is performed ; for systems with large enough chains ( @xmath17 ) we obtain close agreement with recent analytical predictions@xcite .",
    "a delicate issue concerns finite - size effects which arise if one works at too low a temperature for any given system size .",
    "these force the breakdown of the ( essentially ) exponential mwd as one enters a state where a large fraction of the monomers reside in a single chain .",
    "particular care is taken in this regard in section  [ sec : fs ] . in the final section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we summarize our findings . extension and development of these investigations to dynamic properties of ep ( without rings )",
    "will be reported in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "before describing our computational investigation we define the physical model , and recall some essential analytical predictions concerning various properties of equilibrium conformations of ep .    on a coarse - grained level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchep ] ) systems of ep are characterized by the monomer volume fraction @xmath2 , the energy difference @xmath18 between saturated and unsaturated bond states , the height of the activation energy barrier @xmath19 , the persistence length @xmath20 and the excluded volume size @xmath21 of the monomer ( related to the cross sectional diameter of a giant micelle ) . additionally , parameters for the non - bonded interactions may be defined .    as approproate to the gm case",
    "we do not allow closed rings or branching points and suppose that all scission energies are independent of @xmath2 and position of the monomer within the chain .",
    "hence , the rates for scission and recombination @xmath22 and @xmath23 are taken to be constant . for gm simplification ( iii )",
    "is expected to become accurate at high salinity where electrostatic effects may be neglected@xcite .    for ep that are long compared to the persistence length @xmath20",
    ", the main departure from conventional theory of polymer solutions@xcite is that in micellar systems , the reversibility of the self - assembly process ensures that the mwd @xmath24 of the worm - like polymeric species is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this contrasts with ordinary quenched polymers for which the mwd is fixed a priori , and equilibrium only applies to the remaining ( configurational ) degrees of freedom . for ep , only the total volume fraction of the system @xmath25 is a conserved quantity , rather than the entire distribution @xmath24 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the normalized probability distribution @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "the maximum chain length , given by the total number of monomers in the system , becomes of relevance in the context of finite - size effects ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fs ] ) .    at the level of a flory - huggins mean - field approximation ( mfa )",
    "the grand potential density @xmath28 for a @xmath29-dimensional system of ep may be written as @xmath30 \\label{eq : fmfa}\\ ] ] where we choose energy units so that @xmath31 .",
    "the first term is the entropy of mixing , the second the scission energy @xmath18 of a bond and the last term entails the usual lagrange multiplier for the conserved monomer density eq .",
    "( [ eq : conserv ] ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we have suppressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) the part of the free energy linear in chain length . minimizing with respect to the mwd , paying attention to the constraint of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conserv ] ) , yields the exponential size distribution @xmath32 where the chemical potential defines a scaling variable @xmath33 .",
    "this distribution has @xmath34 , i.e. the scaling variable @xmath35 is given in the mfa by the reduced chain length @xmath36 .",
    "using again eq .",
    "( [ eq : conserv ] ) we then obtain the mean - chain length @xmath37 with a ( nonuniversal ) amplitude @xmath38 and the mfa - exponents @xmath39 . this result is expected to be a good approximation near the @xmath40-temperature and in the melt limit where chains become free random walks uncorrelated with themselves and their neighbors@xcite .",
    "note that the chain stiffness may in principle be incorporated in the above description of flexible chains by adding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmfa ] ) a _ free _ energy term for the higher probability of trans - states .",
    "it is straightforward to work out , that for reasonable bending energies this renormalizes the scission energy @xmath18 by a constant of order unity ( that is , of order @xmath41 ) .",
    "here we do not pursue stiffness effects and instead choose a persistence length @xmath20 comparable to the monomer size @xmath21 .",
    "it is relatively simple to extend the above analysis to dilute and semi - dilute solutions of ep .",
    "we recall@xcite from standard polymer theory that the correlation length  for chains of length @xmath42 in the dilute limit is given by the size of the chain @xmath43 .",
    "when the chains ( at given number density ) become so long that they start to overlap at @xmath44 the correlation length of the chain levels off and becomes the ( chain - length independent ) size of a ` blob ' @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the dimension of space , and @xmath47 is the swollen chain ( self - avoiding walk ) exponent .",
    "the mean - field approach remains valid@xcite so long as the basic ` monomer ' is replaced by a blob of length . across the entire concentration range",
    "we may write the grand potential density as @xmath48 .",
    "\\label{eq : f}\\ ] ] we have taken into account here of the free energy change resulting from the _ gain in entropy _ when a chain breaks so that the two new ends can explore a volume @xmath49 .",
    "this gain is enhanced by the fact that the excluded volume repulsion on scales smaller than  is reduced by breaking the chain ; this is accounted for by the additional exponent @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( as we will confirm in sec .",
    "[ sec : mwd ] ) . in mfa @xmath52,@xmath53 , and eq .  ( [ eq : f ] ) simplifies to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmfa ] ) , but this ignores correlations arising from excluded volume effects . in the dilute regime eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath54\\ ] ] so that the relation to the well - known partition function of self - avoiding walks ( with an effective coordination number @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 , is recovered .",
    "note that in concentrated and semidilute systems there are minor corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmfa ] ) from the small fraction of chains that are too long for their excluded volume interactions to be screened by the surrounding chains ( under melt conditions , this applies@xcite for those chains whose length exceeds @xmath57 ) .",
    "this contribution is exponentially small and will be neglected .",
    "note however that the contribution of short chains ( smaller than or comparable to the blob size ) in the semidilute regime is properly included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , so long as the @xmath42-dependence of @xmath58 is taken into account .",
    "in general , this dependence is contained in a scaling function @xmath59 where the scaling variable @xmath60 was already introduced above , and @xmath61 .",
    "this function asymptotes to the radius of gyration and the blob size at large and small @xmath35 respectively .",
    "minimization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) at fixed @xmath2 yields the mwd @xmath62 which depends via  on @xmath63 .",
    "we see that the effective exponent @xmath64 is not in general equal to unity .",
    "hence , the scaling variable @xmath35 is not necessarily given by the reduced chain length @xmath65 as in mfa and as supposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but by @xmath66 . in the two limits far away from the crossover line one",
    "can readily calculate the integrals . in the semi - dilute limit ( @xmath67 ) we obtain @xmath68 , i.e. as in the mfa @xmath69 , but in the dilute limit ( @xmath70 ) we get @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 . substituting everything we obtain finally the distributions @xmath73 we remark that any observed breaking of the scaling @xmath74 is an indication of either crossover between both density regimes ( @xmath75 ) or finite - size effects ( @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) .",
    "one expects for semi - dilute configurations close to the crossover line some reminiscence of the dilute behavior , which should show up in a slightly higher .    as in the mfa - case",
    "we obtain a mean chain length @xmath78 which may be cast in the generic form eq .",
    "( [ eq : lav ] ) , but with the exponents @xmath79 in the dilute and @xmath80 , @xmath81 in the semi - dilute limit .",
    "thus the concentration dependences of the mean molecular weight in the dilute and semidilute limits differ slightly form the one predicted by simple mean - field theory . here",
    "finally we _ define _ ( @xmath82 )",
    "quantitatively as the coordinates of the intercept of the dilute and semidilute asymptotes on a plot of vs. @xmath2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : l ] below ) .",
    "accordingly we may write @xmath83 with exponents @xmath84 and @xmath85 . the amplitudes @xmath86 and @xmath87 are similary related to the prefactors @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the mean chain length ( as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lav ] ) in each density regime ( see also eq .",
    "( [ eq : pq ] ) below ) .",
    "we consider finally the specific heat capacitly of the system .",
    "this offers a possible experimental measure of the typical scission energy @xmath18 . assuming this to be purely enthalpic and independent of temperature , the internal energy density @xmath90 given by the density of end monomers @xmath91 . from this",
    "we get the specific heat per monomer @xmath92 one verifies that @xmath11 has a maximum at @xmath93 which shifts slightly to higher values at lower densities ( from 4 above  to 4.4 below ) .",
    "in ep systems bonds between monomers break and recombine constantly and the chains are only transient objects ( fig .  [ fig : sketchep ] ) .",
    "therefore it is relatively inefficient to base the data structure on the _ chains _ ( such an approach penalized either by sorting times or waste of memory ) .",
    "rather , one has to base it on the _ monomers _ , or even better on the two saturated or unsaturated _ bonds _ of each monomer .",
    "this brings the algorithm as close as possible to what actually happens in systems of ep and makes it possible via pointers between bonds to avoid all sorting procedures , time consuming nested loops and arrays , at the expense of only one additional list required .",
    "our chosen data structure is explained for three initial chains in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchalgo ] , one of which is actually a free monomer with two unsaturated bonds .    using the assumption that no branching of chains is allowed , the two ( possible ) bonds of each monomer @xmath94 are called @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "no specific meaning ( or direction ) is attached to the sign : this is merely a convenience for finding the monomer from the bond list ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "pointers are taken to couple independently of sign , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchalgo ] . in the proposed algorithm",
    "the bonds are coupled by means of a pointer list in a completely transitive fashion ( @xmath98 ) to make recombinations and scissions as fast as possible ; only two simple vector operations are required for breaking bonds or recombination as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchalgo ] . note that this would be impossible in any algorithm involving only one bond per monomer ; the latter requires an implicit sequential order of segments in the chains , forcing sorting operations of the order of the mean - chain length for every recombination .",
    "unsaturated bonds at chain ends point to .",
    "only these bonds may recombine . with this algorithm , no explicit distinction between end - monomers , free monomers or middle monomers is required .    as a work - horse , harnessed to this new data organization",
    ", we exploit the _ bond - fluctuation model _ ( bfm)@xcite for the dmc simulation of polymers .",
    "this choice was mainly motivated by its efficiency , and the large amount of existing data available on monodisperse conventional polymers which can serve as a reference against which to compare the present work .",
    "however , we emphasize that a different choice , such as an off - lattice mc algorithm@xcite , could equally well be combined with our data structure .    in the bfm an `` effective monomer '' consists of an elementary cube",
    "whose eight sites on the hypothetical cubic lattice are blocked for further occupation@xcite .",
    "we consider the formulation of the bfm on a dual lattice , i.e. the center of an effective monomer is represented by _",
    "one _ site on a simple cubic lattice as introduced by m.  mller @xcite . excluding all @xmath99 neighboring sites from occupancy renders the model equivalent to the original model proposed by carmesin and kremer@xcite .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath2 is the fraction of lattice sites blocked by the monomers .",
    "the monomers of a polymer chain are connected via bond vectors @xmath100 , which are taken from the allowed set @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , where @xmath86 stands for all permutations and sign combinations of coordinates .",
    "a bond corresponds physically to the end - to - end distance of a group of @xmath103 successive monomers and can therefore _ fluctuate _ within some range of lengths .",
    "all length are measured in units of the lattice spacing @xmath104 .",
    "the algorithm combines typical advantages of the lattice mc methods with those from the continuous brownian dynamics algorithm .",
    "as defined above , it corresponds to good solvent conditions without hydrodynamics ( but respecting entanglement constraints)@xcite .    as explained above ( sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ) the ends of a given ep are not allowed to bind together in the presented study ; before every recombination we have therefore to check that both monomers do not belong to the same chain . because there is no direct chain information in the data structure this has to be done by working up the list of links ( which adds only four lines to the source code ) . in physical time units",
    "the simulation becomes _ faster _ for higher @xmath18 : the number of recombinations per unit time goes down like @xmath105 , but the chain length only up as @xmath106 .",
    "the barrier energy @xmath107 is taken into account by setting an attempt frequency  for scissions and recombinations .",
    "this is a convenient tool for testing dynamic behavior of the system at different lifetimes of the chains@xcite , although for static properties as studied in this paper , the choice of @xmath19 is immaterial . therefore in almost all runs reported here we set @xmath108 .",
    "those sites of the lattice that are not occupied by monomers are considered empty ( vacancies ) and contribute to the free volume of the system .",
    "we may in principle assign an energy @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) for the nonbonded interaction between monomers in the system@xcite , and a bending energy @xmath111 with @xmath112 being the angle between consecutive bonds@xcite . in the present investigation , however , we focus exclusively on the process of equilibrium polymerization of entirely flexible chains in an athermal solvent setting @xmath113 .",
    "time is measured , as usual , in monte carlo steps ( mcs ) _ per monomer_.",
    "each mcs is organized as follows :    *   a monomer is chosen at random and allowed to perform a move according to the bfm algorithm@xcite . * with a frequency @xmath114 , i.e. every @xmath115 mcs , one of the bonds is chosen at random ( remember that there are twice as many bonds as monomers ) . if one of the bonds happens to be a saturated @xmath116-bond an attempt is made to break it , otherwise if it is unsaturated , i.e. the monomer is at the end of a chain or a free monomer , an attempt is made to create a bond with another monomer that might be present on _ any _ of the 6 neighboring @xmath116 sites .",
    "applying the metropolis algorithm@xcite a scission is performed whenever the value of a random number between 0 and 1 is smaller than @xmath105 .",
    "on the other hand , with the bond energy being positive ( @xmath117 ) , recombination is always accepted so long as a ring is not thereby created .",
    "note that @xmath116-bonds are broken irrespective of which particular bond vector , i.e. which of the @xmath118 possibilities , they stand for , and that , therefore , detailed balance requires that for recombination _ all _ ( and not just _",
    "one _ as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) of these sites have to be checked for possible unsaturated bonds .",
    "these neighboring sites have to be checked _ randomly _ ; a typewriterlike search along the list of possible bond vectors creates correlations in violation of the detailed balance requirement .",
    "( this has subtle but measurable consequences . ) note finally that our decision to restrict the breaking and recombination to the 6 shortest ( @xmath116 ) bonds avoids ergodicity problems arising from crossed pairs of bonds that can result in immobile monomers.@xcite    in the presented study the volume fraction was varied over nearly three orders of magnitude from @xmath119 ( @xmath120 monomers per box ) to @xmath121 ( @xmath122 monomers per box ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phie ] . for densities smaller than @xmath123 cubic lattices with linear dimension @xmath124 were used , for higher densities a smaller box with @xmath125 .",
    "this should be compared to ref .",
    "@xcite where a @xmath126-box with @xmath127 particles ( @xmath128 ) was the largest achievable .",
    "one should bear in mind that densities around @xmath129 correspond to extremely dense systems ( melt conditions ) in the bfm , since at higher densities the blocking of neighboring sites by other monomers leaves no room for movement and the system goes effectively into a glassy state@xcite .",
    "the starting configuration consists of randomly distributed and nonbonded monomers which we cool down step by step ( a sequence of so - called ` t - jumps ' ) each step sampling a higher scission energy up to the maximum @xmath130 . as mentioned above , for the static results we usually set @xmath131 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath132 . due to the constant breaking and recombining of the bonds the equilibration is then much faster than in systems of quenched polymers .",
    "following rouault et al@xcite we have checked this explicitly by monitoring the evolution of mean - chain length @xmath133 and radius of gyration @xmath134 after every t - jump .",
    "measurements of static properties such as the mean - square end - to - end distance , the radius of gyration  or the specific heat ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : phie ] ) were performed in intervals of roughly @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the terminal relaxation time of the system for the parameters @xmath137 considered@xcite .",
    "typical runs ( with @xmath131 ) covered easily up to @xmath138 .",
    "the melt density @xmath139 was a particular focus for our study of dynamical properties@xcite , requiring better statistics .",
    "hence , for this @xmath2 we have sampled over 128 independent configurations . however , for all static properties other than the specific heat  and , for the largest @xmath18 values some mwd data , a long run from a single starting configuration was quite sufficient .",
    "indeed , statistical errors are generally within the symbol size in the data presented below .",
    "there are two different kinds of  finite - size effects \" in this simulation .",
    "the first , and most important , arises from chains that are too small .",
    "not surprisingly , we found in configurations with @xmath140 ( below the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phie ] ) non - universal behavior . for clarity",
    "these data points are omitted in most of our plots .",
    "second , for systems with ( essentially ) exponential mwd one has to worry about the system size whenever  becomes of the order of the total number of monomers in the box .",
    "this important issue will be addressed in section  [ sec : fs ] where we present results of a systematic finite - size study summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : fs ] confirming unambiguously that the systems reported are indeed sufficiently large .",
    "most of the simulations on static properties were performed on two single dec alpha workstation over a period of year . a parallel version of the algorithm ,",
    "however , was also developed and some of the computations at melt density mentioned above have been carried out on the facilities of epcc , edinburgh .",
    "the latter computations focused mainly on the dynamics of equilibrium polymers as we report elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in what follows we examine the influence of density @xmath2 and scission energy @xmath18 on mean chain length , mwd @xmath24 , specific heat per monomer  and the size of the chains , as measured e.g. by the radius of gyration .      in fig .",

    "[ sec : simulation ] and elaborated further in sec .",
