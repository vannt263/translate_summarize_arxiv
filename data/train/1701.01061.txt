    "software vulnerabilities are still a predominant issue for application security . over 2000 software vulnerabilities",
    "were newly reported within just three months  @xcite . as distributed",
    ", networked computing becomes omnipresent in the internet of things  ( iot ) , the risk of damage even increases , allowing remote exploits on a large scale .",
    "a major reason for this fact is code complexity , which makes traditional secure design paradigms like software verification or testing reach its limits .",
    "hence , research focuses on securing sensitive code only and executing it in architecturally isolated containers , often referred to as enclaves .",
    "since an enclave is protected against all non - enclave code , the whole os stack can safely be considered untrusted without reducing security of the enclave .",
    "the evolution of isolated execution is long and diverse  @xcite .",
    "intel sgx  @xcite deserves particular attention since it not only provides comprehensive enclave protection but is also available to the broad intel x86 community .",
    "sgx targets high - performance cloud computing , where the cloud provider is entirely distrusted , as well as digital rights management  ( drm ) .    in order to protect not only enclave execution but also user i / o , one requires trusted paths between enclaves and i / o devices .",
    "currently , sgx only works with proprietary trusted paths like intel protected audio video path  ( pavp ) which rely on the intel management engine  ( me )  @xcite .",
    "however , proprietary trusted paths are hard to analyze regarding security .",
    "moreover , they are not generic and address specific devices and scenarios only . unfortunately , sgx lacks support for generic trusted paths .",
    "* contributions . * in this work we present sgxio , which is , to our knowledge , the first generic trusted path architecture for sgx .",
    "sgxio protects secure user applications as well as associated trusted paths against an untrusted os .",
    "user applications benefit from sgx protection while trusted paths are established via a small and trusted hypervisor . to that end",
    ", we identify and solve several challenges in linking the security domains of sgx and the trusted hypervisor .",
    "this allows a remote party to attest not only enclave code but also the whole trusted path setup .",
    "also , sgxio allows human end users to verify trusted paths without requiring additional hardware .",
    "sgxio improves upon existing generic trusted paths for x86 systems with an easier and more intuitive programming model .",
    "furthermore , we show how sgxio can tweak debug enclaves to behave like production enclaves .",
    "therefore , the trusted hypervisor selectively disables enclave debug instructions .",
    "finally , we give a novel zero - overhead , non - interactive key transport scheme for establishing an 128-bit symmetric key between two local sgx enclaves .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows : section  [ sec : related ] gives related work , followed by an overview of sgx in section  [ sec : sgx ] .",
    "section  [ sec : problem ] discusses the threat model and challenges .",
    "section  [ sec : arch ] presents our sgxio architecture while section  [ sec : security ] gives a thorough security analysis .",
    "section  [ sec : sgx_debug ] shows how sgxio can apply the debug enclave tweak .",
    "it is followed by further considerations in section  [ sec : implementation ] and a conclusion in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this section discusses prior work on isolated execution and trusted paths .",
    "specifically , we compare to arm trustzone , which is arm s counterpart to sgx .",
    "traditionally , security kernels are used to achieve strong process and resource isolation .",
    "one soon realized that security kernels itself are the achilles heel of the whole system security and need complexity reduction .",
    "this paved the way for microkernels , for which sel4 is a prominent example .",
    "the developers of sel4 reduced kernel code size to 8700 lines of c code and conducted formal verification to proof correctness  @xcite . even with a secure microkernel in place , designing a fully - featured , secure os on top of it is still an unmet challenge  @xcite .",
    "hence , one has to live with a feature - rich but untrusted os .",
    "isolating an application from such an untrusted os is essential for any trusted path .",
    "there exist various techniques for isolated execution , which range from pure hypervisor designs  @xcite over hardware - software co - designs  @xcite to pure hardware extensions  @xcite .",
    "sgxio uses intel sgx  @xcite , which , from a functional perspective , cumulates previous work in software isolation , attestation and transparent memory encryption .",
    "others isolate sensitive code by keeping it entirely in the cpu cache  @xcite or by migrating it to system management ram on x86  @xcite",
    ". often , dedicated security co - processors are used  @xcite .",
    "the trusted platform module  ( tpm )  @xcite is a security co - processor which does not directly offer software isolation on its own .",
    "however , it can be used in conjunction with intel txt  @xcite to set up an isolated execution environment  @xcite .",
    "any communication with the untrusted os is problematic and needs careful validation  @xcite .",
    "et al .  _",
    "therefore reduce the untrusted syscall interface to a bare minimum and shift a whole windows 8 library into an sgx enclave , which tremendously increases the tcb  @xcite .",
    "there exist various attempts for integrating trusted paths directly into existing commodity oses .",
    "however , they usually suffer from a bloated tcb , covering the whole os  @xcite .",
    "more sound trusted paths consider the os untrusted .",
    "one can distinguish between generic trusted paths and specific trusted paths .",
    "latter are limited to specific devices or scenarios .",
    "* generic trusted paths . * zhou _ et al .  _",
    "build a generic trusted path on x86 systems in a pure hypervisor - based design  @xcite .",
    "they show the first comprehensive approach on x86 systems , protecting a trusted path all the way from the application level down to the device level .",
    "they consider pci device misconfiguration , dma attacks as well as interrupt spoofing attacks .",
    "however , pure hypervisor - based designs come at a price .",
    "they strictly separate the untrusted stack from the trusted one .",
    "hence , the hypervisor is in charge of managing all secure applications and all associated resources itself .",
    "this includes secure process and memory management with scheduling , verified launch and attestation .",
    "also , communication between both security domains might be non - trivial due to synchronization issues or potentially mismatching application binary interfaces  ( abi ) .",
    "in contrast , sgxio uses the comparably easy programming model of sgx enclaves , in which the untrusted os is in charge of managing secure enclaves .",

    "second , while waiting for secure input from the user , the os is suspended .",
    "in contrast , sgxio supports full parallelism between the untrusted os and secure applications .",
    "another way of establishing a trusted path is via dedicated i / o devices  @xcite .",
    "the i / o device natively supports cryptography , which allows an application to directly open a cryptographic channel to it .",
    "this bypasses any untrusted software or hardware , making a trusted hypervisor unnecessary .",
    "however , this concept does not generalize to other i / o devices , especially legacy devices .",
    "many trusted paths build on proprietary hardware and software like intel s protected audio video path  ( pavp ) as well as its successor , intel insider  @xcite .",
    "both rely on intel s proprietary management engine  ( me ) .",

    ", ruan describes a protected transaction display  ( ptd ) application running on the me , which makes use of pavp to securely obtain a one - time pins from the user .",
    "however , me - related code is proprietary and kept under wraps .",
    "this not only strongly limits potential use cases but also hinders transparent security assessment .",
    "arm trustzone combines secure execution with trusted path support .",
    "a trustzone compatible cpu provides a secure world mode , which is orthogonal to classical privilege levels .",
    "the secure world is isolated against the normal world and operates a whole trusted stack , including security kernel , device drivers and applications .",
    "in addition , trustzone is complemented by a set of hardware modules , which allow strong isolation of physical memory as well as peripherals .",
    "also , device interrupts can be directly routed into the secure world .",
    "trustzone can be combined with a system mmu , similar to an iommu , which can prevent dma attacks .",
    "thus , trustzone not only allows isolated execution  @xcite but also generic trusted paths  @xcite , which is a significant advantage over sgx .",
    "in contrast to sgx , trustzone does not distinguish between different secure application processes in hardware .",
    "it requires a security kernel for secure process isolation , management , attestation and similar .",
    "intel software guard extensions  ( sgx ) have been rolled out with skylake in october 2015  @xcite .",
    "sgx comprises a new set of x86 instructions , enabling user applications to declare parts of its virtual address space as secure enclave .",
    "the enclave can access its hosting application s memory while the host can not touch enclave memory .",
    "in general , any non - enclave access into the enclave is prohibited by the cpu .",
    "the os is entirely distrusted and is supervised by the cpu in all enclave management operations .",
    "in addition , sgx encrypts all enclave memory on the fly when written to dram using a dedicated hardware encryption module .",
    "sgx provides verified enclave launching , attestation and sealing . as such",
    ", sgx encourages a small trusted computing base  ( tcb ) , only consisting of enclave code and the cpu itself .    in the following we outline verified enclave launch , attestation and sealing before discussing enclave debugging and licensing . for more details",
    "we refer to available literature  @xcite .",
    "especially dynamic enclave page management , which is not covered here , can be looked up in  @xcite .",
    "* verified enclave launch.*[sec : enclave_startup ] when loading an enclave into memory , the cpu measures its content in a chained cryptographic hash log , stored in a register called ` mrenclave ` .",
    "this is comparable to a platform configuration register  ( pcr ) in a tpm  @xcite . before running the enclave , the cpu verifies ` mrenclave ` against a vendor - signed version and aborts on a mismatch",
    "hence , ` mrenclave ` vouches for integrity of the enclave startup .",
    "* attestation and sealing . * in order to assess enclave security , sgx provides attestation mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "local attestation enables an enclave to verify another enclave running on the same physical cpu .",
    "remote attestation can be used by a remote party to check if the attested enclave is indeed running on a genuine intel cpu .",
    "it allows initial provisioning of keys and secrets .",
    "this is required since enclave code is public , not allowing to embed secrets directly in the code .",
    "attestation is based on a cpu - generated , signed report structure containing ` mrenclave ` .",
    "the report structure is able to hold additional user data .",
    "one can use this to authentically exchange information between enclaves via local attestation and agree on an encryption key , for example .",
    "sgx also allows an enclave to obtain a sealing key which is bound to the local cpu .",
    "sgx permits making the sealing key dependent on ` mrenclave ` .",
    "hence , the same sealing key can only be queried from exactly the same enclave , if loaded correctly on the same , genuine intel cpu .",
    "the enclave can use the sealing key to encrypt arbitrary data for offline storage , preserving its state among multiple system reboots .",
    "* debugging .",
    "* sgx distinguishes between debug and production enclaves .",
    "debug enclaves can be accessed by the os via ` edbgrd ` and ` edbgwr ` instructions while production enclaves can not . moreover , debug enclaves can opt - in to ordinary x86 breakpoint handling and performance monitoring  @xcite .",
    "this supports the enclave development process . in a production setting",
    ", however , enclaves have to run in production mode to protect against an untrusted os . during initialization of an enclave",
    ", one can set a debug mode flag , specifying whether the enclave shall be run in debug or production mode .",
    "this choice yields different ` mrenclave ` values for either option , making a debug enclave distinguishable from a production enclave",
    ".    * enclave licensing .",
    "* sgx has a controversially discussed `` feature '' , called launch enclave  @xcite . during enclave initialization",
    ", the cpu verifies a so - called ` einittoken ` , which contains several enclave attributes to enforce , including the debug mode flag .",
    "the ` einittoken ` has to be signed by a special launch key , which is owned by so - called launch enclaves , issued by intel .",
    "hence , by issuing proper launch enclaves , intel has full control over which enclaves are to be executed in debug or production mode .",
    "the sgx evaluation sdk is shipped with a launch enclave issuing ` einittoken`s for debug enclaves only  @xcite . in order to run an enclave in production mode",
    ", one needs to obtain a proper license from intel  @xcite .",
    "sgxio utilizes sgx as one building block to provide isolated execution",
    ". however , the threat models of pure sgx and sgxio differ .",
    "this section elaborates on the threat model of sgxio and shows that , in contrast to pure sgx , physical attacks do nt have to be considered for trusted paths .",
    "furthermore , the challenges arising from the combination of sgx with a trusted hypervisor are discussed .",
    "* sgx * has been designed as isolated execution technology with a minimal trusted computing base  ( tcb ) .",
    "the tcb only contains the processor itself , which acts as trust anchor , and the code running within enclaves .",
    "everything else is considered potentially malicious .",
    "this not only includes all other software components ( e.g. ,  os , hypervisor ) but also the hardware environment it operates in .",
    "therefore , sgx not only considers logical attacks but also physical attacks .",
    "this threat model perfectly fits the requirements for secure cloud computing in which a customer wants to protect enclave code and data against an untrusted cloud provider , controlling the software stack and the hardware . in this use case",
    ", all communication with an enclave can be performed using securely encrypted and authenticated channels .",
    "also , content providers can use sgx to enforce a drm scheme on an untrusted consumer pc .    in a local",
    "setting , however , a user wants to benefit from sgx by protecting user - centric applications against a potentially compromised os .",
    "especially , the communication between user apps and the user via i / o peripherals needs protection from the os via a trusted path .",
    "this setting somehow contradicts the threat model of sgx , which considers the physical environment , and therefore also the local user , a threat .",
    "currently , in order to achieve a trusted path with sgx , one has to rely on encrypted interfaces like pavp .",
    "however , the prevalence of unencrypted i / o devices in todays computers and the lack of support to securely communicate with these devices demands other , more generic mechanisms .",
    "* sgxio * fixes this shortcoming by extending sgx with a generic trusted path .",
    "many user - centric applications can profit from this additional feature .",
    "this covers pure local applications like confidential document viewers , anti - spoofing password prompts , secure password generators and password safes but also internet scenarios like secure conferencing and chat applications as well as secure online banking . to take latter as example",
    ", online banking can not only be secured up to the user s browser via tls , for example , but up to the i / o devices via trusted paths , as depicted in figure  [ fig : banking ] .",
    "moreover , sgxio allows both the user and the online bank to verify the trusted path .",
    "this means that sensitive information like login credentials , the account balance , or the transaction amount can be protected even if other software running on the user s computer , including the os , is infected by malware .",
    "additionally , sgxio provides attestation mechanisms to enable the bank as well as the user to verify that trusted paths are established and functional .",
    "having a trusted path has implications on the threat model of sgxio .",
    "a physical attacker has direct access to i / o devices and can impersonate the user without subverting trusted paths .",
    "thus , trusted paths can only protect against logical attacks but can not provide physical security at all .",
    "the following section explains the threat model of sgxio in detail .      in general , the adversaries attacking sgxio attempt to subvert a trusted path between a user app and an i / o device .",
    "subsequently , they succeed if they are able to break the confidentiality or authenticity of such a trusted path .",
    "* logical attacks * are the main concern of sgxio .",
    "attackers are assumed to have full control over the os and know the whole software configuration including all enclave code .",
    "this is a realistic scenario , addressing both local and remote software attacks which might even yield kernel privileges to attackers .",
    "attackers can therefore directly attack enclave interfaces visible to the os by running enclaves in a fake environment within the os .",
    "also , attackers can dynamically load and execute custom user apps and drivers and open other trusted path sessions .",
    "moreover , indirect attacks on a trusted path can be performed by misconfiguring devices under os control , as outlined by zhou _",
    "et al .  _",
    "the idea of such attacks is to manipulate noninvolved devices to interfere with a trusted path .",
    "for example , a pci devices could be configured such that its address range overlaps those of the user device .",
    "also , malicious direct memory access  ( dma ) requests could be issued and interrupts could be spoofed .",
    "all code in the trusted computing base ( e.g. , secure user applications , secure i / o drivers and the hypervisor ) is assumed to be correct and not vulnerable to logical attacks . using a formally verified hypervisor such as sel4",
    "@xcite supports this assumption .    * physical attacks *",
    "are not considered in sgxio , as already explained , since the user interacting with the system has to be trusted anyway . as with sgx ,",
    "denial - of - service  ( dos ) as well as side channel attacks are also out of scope for sgxio .",
    "note that sgxio requires a modern intel platform with sgx support as well as support for tpm - based trusted boot .",
    "all hardware ( cpu , chipset , peripherals ) is expected to work correctly .",
    "sgxio combines sgx with a trusted hypervisor to provide a generic trusted path .",
    "however , the hypervisor and sgx form two disjoint security domains with two different trust anchors , which are not designed to collaborate .",
    "subsequently , connecting both domains is a non - trivial task .",
    "this essentially breaks down to two major challenges which had to be solved : first , the security domains of the hypervisor and sgx enclaves have to be linked .",
    "more concretely , we need a way for sgx enclaves to check the presence and the authenticity of the hypervisor .",
    "we name this problem _",
    "hypervisor attestation_. once the hypervisor is attested , it extends trust to any trusted path it establishes .",
    "second , the sgxio architecture relies on multiple sgx enclaves which communicate using keys based on local attestation , as discussed in the following sections .",
    "these enclaves are executed in different security contexts ( trusted hypervisor vs. untrusted os ) . however , in sgx enclaves are unaware of their context , making them vulnerable to _ enclave virtualization attacks_. sgxio prevents such attacks via a careful interface design between both contexts .",
    "this section presents our sgxio architecture and elaborate on its isolation guarantees .",
    "we discuss design of secure user applications , secure i / o drivers as well as the hypervisor .",
    "sgxio is composed of two parts : a trusted stack and a virtual machine  ( vm ) , as seen in figure  [ fig : sw_stack ] .",
    "the trusted stack contains a small security hypervisor , one or more secure i / o drivers , which we simply call _ drivers _ , as well as a trusted boot  ( tb ) enclave .",
    "the vm hosts an untrusted commodity os like linux , which runs secure user applications , also abbreviated with _ user apps_.    user apps want to communicate securely with the end user .",
    "they open an encrypted communication channel to a secure i / o driver to tunnel through the untrusted os .",
    "the driver in turn requires secure communication with a generic user i / o device , which we term _",
    "user device_. to achieve this , the hypervisor exclusively binds user devices to the corresponding drivers .",
    "note that any other device is directly assigned to the vm .",
    "i / o on those unprotected devices directly passes through the hypervisor without performance penalty .",
    "the trusted path names both , the encrypted user - app - to - driver communication and the exclusive driver - to - device binding . it is indicated with a solid line in figure  [ fig : sw_stack ] .",
    "drivers use the tb enclave to get assured of correct trusted path setup by attesting the hypervisor , which is indicated by a dotted line .",
    "sgxio establishes a trusted path all the way from a user app to the user device .",
    "this requires isolation on several layers .",
    "first , all trusted stack memory needs to be isolated from the untrusted os and direct memory access  ( dma ) .",
    "second , the trusted path itself requires isolation from the os .",
    "third , the user device needs isolation from all other devices which are under control of the os .",
    "this section outlines how sgxio meets these isolation requirements .",
    "* trusted memory isolation * is a prerequisite for securely executing trusted code in an untrusted environment .",
    "this affects user apps as well as the trusted stack . to achieve memory isolation of the user app",
    ", it is executed within an enclave .",
    "sgx isolates all enclave memory from the untrusted os . to achieve memory isolation for the trusted stack , the hypervisor confines the untrusted os in a vm",
    "moreover , the hypervisor implements a strict memory partitioning by configuring the memory management unit  ( mmu ) appropriately .",
    "this prevents the os from escaping the vm and tampering with the trusted stack .",
    "direct memory access  ( dma ) is a more subtle threat to memory isolation  @xcite .",
    "a dma - capable device can directly access memory , bypassing any mmu protection and potentially violating integrity and confidentiality of trusted memory .",
    "sgx prevents dma from accessing enclave memory , hence the user app is safe against dma attacks  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the trusted stack has to be protected against such attacks .",
    "modern chipsets typically incorporate an i / o memory management unit  ( iommu ) , also termed on intel systems .",
    "the iommu restricts device dma to specific portions of ram only . by properly configuring the iommu",
    ", the hypervisor can protect the whole trusted stack against device dma attacks",
    ".    * trusted path isolation . *",
    "the trusted path has to be protected on two layers , namely the communication between user app and driver as well as the interaction between driver and user device .",
    "the user app communicates with the driver via the untrusted os stack , hence encryption is necessary .",
    "the interaction between driver and user device is protected by the hypervisor .",
    "therefore , the hypervisor establishes an exclusive binding between a driver and the corresponding user device .",
    "moreover , the hypervisor mutually isolates all drivers .",
    "thus , an attacker , loading arbitrary driver code at will , can not interfere with trusted paths established by other drivers .",
    "* user device isolation .",
    "* as outlined before , a malicious os could misconfigure devices to interfere with the trusted path . in that way",
    ", os - controlled pci devices could be forced to overlap their mmio region or i / o port range with those of the user device or issue forged interrupts on behalf of the user device . to protect against these attacks ,",
    "zhou _ et al .",
    "_ implement several policies in the hypervisor to detect and prevent malicious device configurations .",
    "this effectively isolates a user device from other os - controlled devices .",
    "their approach is also applicable to sgxio .",
    "secure user applications play a central role in concrete use case scenarios like secure online banking .",
    "this section outlines principles for designing user apps and shows how user apps securely communicate with drivers . in the end , we elaborate on the enclave programming model .    * design principles . *",
    "key to any secure user - centric application is a trusted path which protects user i / o against advanced malware like keyloggers and likewise . without trusted path , an attacker could impersonate the user and act on its behalf , even if the user app itself is not compromised . to provide its service , a user app might communicate with other user apps or exchange sensitive data with a remote server using tls , for example .",
    "any operation on sensitive data is carried out within an enclave .",
    "unproblematic code is kept outside the enclave .",
    "this covers glue code to the os and untrusted libraries like file management , network socket access and likewise .",
    "all interaction with untrusted code needs careful validation inside the enclave  @xcite . to keep state among multiple invocations ,",
    "the user app can encrypt sensitive data for offline storage using sgx sealing , for example .    * encrypted channel . * to open a trusted path , the user app sets up an encrypted channel to a secure i / o driver .",
    "an encrypted channel protects sensitive user i / o against the untrusted os . to open such a channel , the user app needs to share an encryption key with the driver via some form of key exchange .",
    "sgx local attestation can assist in key exchange by providing means to authentically exchange information between user app enclaves and driver enclaves",
    ". a straight - forward implementation uses diffie - hellman key exchange , as suggested by  @xcite .",
    "however , local attestation inherently provides a much faster way of exchanging key material .",
    "we give a novel , lightweight key transport scheme , which comes with just a single uni - directional invocation of local attestation .",
    "we reuse the already pre - shared report key to derive random 128-bit encryption keys .",
    "the scheme works as follows : the user enclave generates a local attestation report over a random salt , targeted at the driver enclave .",
    "however , instead of delivering the actual report to the driver enclave , the user enclave keeps it private and uses the report s mac as symmetric key .",
    "it then sends the salt and its identity to the driver enclave , which can recompute the mac to obtain the same key .",
    "details of this scheme are given in the appendix .",
    "once a key is established , one can use any authenticated encryption to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data stream between user app and driver .",
    "use of an authenticated encryption scheme ensures confidentiality and integrity of the data stream . by doing key exchange via sgx local attestation , the user app and the driver can mutually authenticate each other",
    "this is also referred to as origin integrity .",
    "* enclave programming model . *",
    "sgxio benefits from sgx s easy enclave programming model  @xcite .",
    "user app enclaves are executed directly on a host application running within the untrusted os .",
    "hence , secure user applications are treated similar to ordinary application processes .",
    "the os has control over memory management , process management and scheduling of enclaves , although sgx carefully validates any action that might affect enclave security .",
    "also , integration of multiple enclaves into a bigger user application stack is easy since enclaves share parts of the register set and the virtual address space with their host for communication purposes .",
    "moreover , sgx supports multithreading as well as enclave debugging .",
    "also , sgx natively provides verified launch and attestation of enclaves , which is tedious to implement in software . to support enclave development",
    ", intel provides a software development kit  @xcite as well as a comprehensive enclave developer guide  @xcite .      secure i / o drivers are responsible for connecting user apps and user devices .",
    "drivers are hosted and protected by the hypervisor .",
    "although hypervisor protection is sufficient to isolate drivers from the untrusted os , actual driver logic is in addition executed in an enclave .",
    "this helps in setting up an encrypted communication channel with user apps , as previously described .",
    "also , driver enclaves are subject to attestation , allowing identification via their ` mrenclave ` values .    when designing a driver one has to make certain design choices .",
    "we opt for two strategies , namely domain multiplexing and portability , targeting commodity operating systems .",
    "note that sgxio supports other choices as well .",
    "_ domain multiplexing _ allows the same driver and thus the same user device to be shared across security domains . _ portability _ refers to drivers being compatible to different operating systems .",
    "* domain multiplexing . *",
    "a driver handles the data stream from and to a user device and forwards it to the os or a user app , respectively .",
    "since many user devices like human interface devices or graphic cards are potentially shared between the untrusted os and user apps , the driver has to multiplex the data stream between those security domains . in our example",
    "( see figure  [ fig : sw_stack ] ) , the driver offers its service to the os via two separate virtual devices . during normal operation",
    ", the driver simply routes the unmodified data stream to the first virtual device , which matches the device class of the user device .",
    "this gives the os transparent access to the user device .",
    "if the user app requests a trusted path , the driver redirects all traffic to the second virtual device , however in an encrypted fashion .",
    "the user app , knowing the proper decryption key , can access this second virtual device to tunnel through the untrusted os .",
    "this second virtual device can be any standard character device , for example , which just forwards the encrypted data stream . in this example , the driver implements strict temporal multiplexing between the os and the user app .",
    "however , one could enforce arbitrary security policies .",
    "for example , the driver could implement spatial partitioning of a graphic card s frame buffer to allow secure screen overlays . or it could intercept and mask certain keystrokes to react on secure attention sequences  @xcite and encrypt password entry , for example .    * portability . *",
    "in our example we encourage virtual devices as communication interface between drivers and the os , _ cf .",

    "sgxio rebuilds similar mechanisms for the hypervisor .",
    "isolation of trusted memory has already been discussed in section  [ sec : isolation ] .",
    "verified launch is implemented via _ trusted boot _ of the hypervisor with support for _ hypervisor attestation_.    with trusted boot and hypervisor attestation in place , sgxio can bind the sgx and the hypervisor domain .",
    "the binding needs to be bidirectional , allowing both the hypervisor and sgx enclaves to put trust in the other domain .",
    "one direction is easy : the hypervisor can extend trust to sgx by running enclaves in a safe , hypervisor - protected environment .",
    "these enclaves can in turn use local attestation to extend trust to any other enclaves in the system .",
    "however , the opposite direction is challenging : on the one hand , enclaves need confidence that the hypervisor is not compromised and binds user devices correctly to drivers .",
    "effectively , this requires enclaves to invoke hypervisor attestation .",
    "sgxio achieves this with assistance of the tb enclave . on the other hand ,",
    "sgx is not designed to cooperate with a trusted hypervisor .",
    "recall that sgx considers all non - enclave code untrusted .",
    "in fact , sgx explicitly prohibits use of any instruction inside an enclave that might be used to communicate with the hypervisor  @xcite .",
    "even if hypervisor attestation succeeds , an enclave can not easily learn whether it is legitimately executed by the hypervisor or virtualized by an attacker in a fake environment .",

    "this notification needs to be unforgeable to prevent the os from faking it .",
    "moreover , it needs to help the user distinguish different user apps , not least because an attacker might also run arbitrary user apps under his control .      trusted boot",
    "allows verifying integrity of the hypervisor by doing a measured launch over all booted code . without it ,",

    "if the attacker compromises the hypervisor image , the pcr will yield a wrong value during trusted boot , which is detected by the tb enclave .",
    "however , the attacker can make hypervisor attestation work again by diverting tb enclave communication to an attacker - controlled tpm .",

    "as already mentioned , hypervisor attestation vouches for security of trusted paths and serves as basis for remote attestation .",
    "this section describes the whole trust hierarchy involved in remote attestation , as shown in figure  [ fig : trust_chain ] .",

    "it is up to a remote verifier and individual enclaves to build a trust hierarchy among `` good '' enclaves .",

    "the entrusting party does not only verify validity of an sgx attestation report but also check for a correct ` mrenclave ` value , which uniquely identifies an enclave codebase .    in a typical scenario ,",
    "a remote verifier wants to establish a trusted path to a user .",
    "it therefore extends trust to a specific user app  ( ua ) under its control , which in turn entrusts appropriate secure i / o drivers  ( drv ) .",
    "drivers extend trust to the tb enclave , which does hypervisor attestation as previously outlined .",
    "if hypervisor attestation succeeds , trust is implicitly extended to the tb host and all driver host processes together with all trusted paths to user devices . if at any point in the trust hierarchy attestation fails , the affected entities will terminate trusted path attestation .",
    "sgxio allows a user to locally assess if he is talking with the correct user app via a trusted path .",
    "this does not require additional hardware such as an external handheld verification device  @xcite or similar .",
    "instead , we stick to sharing a secret piece of information between user and user app , similar to  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we discuss the common scenario of a trusted screen path and a trusted keyboard path .",
    "when the user starts the user app , the user app requests a trusted input path to the keyboard and a trusted output path to the screen from the corresponding drivers .",
    "if for any reason one or both trusted path setups fail , the user app terminates with an error . in the case of success",
    ", the user app displays the pre - shared secret information via the screen driver to the user .",
    "the user verifies this information to get assured of a valid trusted path setup for this user app . since an attacker",

    "supports several configurable bitmaps , making certain instructions trap into the hypervisor when executed from withing a vm .",
    "these bitmaps are configured by the hypervisor via so - called virtual machine control structures  ( vmcs ) . with the release of sgx",
    ", intel added a new bitmap for sgx encls instructions , called encls - exiting bitmap .",
    "this allows the hypervisor to selectively intercept encls instructions .",

    "since the hypervisor is trusted , we can consider sgx debugging features as disabled .",
    "hence , we have effectively turned all debug enclaves inside the vm into production equivalents .",

    ", one has to opt for real production enclaves .",
    "nevertheless , honest server administrators could use the tweak to obtain sgx protection without licensing .",
    "this would help in strongly isolating server code and reducing the tcb from the whole system down to the hypervisor and the enclave code .",
