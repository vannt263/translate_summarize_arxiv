    "this seemingly simple setup can be described by an anderson model coupled to a fermionic bath with a nonconstant density of states ( dos ) .",

    "_ the kondo resonance appears when the dos shows a sharp peak at the fermi energy , while the kondo singlet itself is preserved .",
    "the proposed dqd setup also allows for the appearance of a pseudogap in the effective dos , leading to a critical transition between kondo and non - kondo phases .",
    "these phenomena substantially modify the spectral function of the interacting dot .",
