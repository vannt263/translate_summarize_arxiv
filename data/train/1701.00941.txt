    "a new class of intrinsically bright supernovae , labelled superluminous supernovae ( slsne ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , was unveiled during last decade .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "those exhibiting hydrogen - free ejecta are grouped together as slsne  i , while those showing hydrogen as slsne  ii .",
    "slsne  i , although intrinsically rare @xcite are the most commonly studied and usually found in dwarf , metal poor galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". at about 30 days after peak , these sne tend to show strong resemblances to normal or broad - lined type ic sne at peak luminosity @xcite and thus are also usually referred to as slsne ic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their light curves show significant differences in width and temporal evolution with the rise times being correlated with the declines rates @xcite .",
    "whether or not there are two distinct groups , and two different physical mechanisms for the fast - evolving ( e.g. sn  2010gx ) and slow - evolving ( e.g. sn  2007bi ) explosions remains to be seen .",
    "in addition , thanks to modern imaging surveys we have been able to differentiate between two groups of hydrogen rich slsne , which are rarer by volume than slsne  i. the first is that of strongly interacting sne such as sn  2006gy @xcite of which the enormous luminosity is undeniably powered by the interaction of supernova ejecta with dense circumstellar ( csm ) shells and hence usually referred to as slsne iin to highlight the similarity with normal type iin .",
    "whereas , the second group is that of bright , broad lined h - rich sne labelled slsne ii , such as sn  2008es @xcite , which have shallow but persistent and broad balmer lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "they show spectroscopic evolution that is similar , in some ways to type ii - l supernovae , but the evolution happens on a longer timescale .",
    "the mechanism responsible to power the luminosities of slsne i & ii is still debated . however , the most favoured is that of a magnetar as a central engine , depositing additional energy into the supernova ejecta @xcite .",
    "the popularity of this scenario is due to its ability to reproduce a variety of observables for all the types ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , alternative scenarios such as the accretion onto a central black hole @xcite , the interaction with a dense circumstellar medium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or between two massive shells ( pulsational pair instability , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a pair instability explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are still feasible alternatives .    due to their intrinsic brightness ,",
    "slsne  i are emerging as a high redshift probes and might be a new class of distance indicators @xcite . to use them with the new generation of telescopes such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) or euclid",
    "we need novel approaches to better understand their progenitor scenario , reveal the mechanism powering the light curve and investigate on the nature of their differences .",
    "these new approaches include analyses of large dataset ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , spectropolarimetric studies @xcite or devoted spectroscopic modelling of photospheric @xcite and nebular spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the slowly evolving group of slsne i , of which the first to be discovered was sn  2007bi @xcite , is small in number but of particular interest because the light curves decline at a rate consistent with powering by @xmath3co during first 100 - 200 days after maximum .",
    "a very large amount of explosively produced @xmath3ni is required to power the peak through @xmath3co decay ( to produce stable @xmath3fe ) . with estimates in the region of 4 - 6m@xmath4",
    "this led @xcite to propose a pair - instability explosion origin for sn  2007bi ( in combination with spectral analysis ) from a very massive progenitor star above @xmath5150m@xmath4 .",
    "hence any new objects with similar light curve and spectra behaviour are of interest to study over long durations .",
    "here we present an extensive dataset for , a slow - evolving slsne  i discovered by the la silla quest survey and studied by the public eso spectroscopic survey for transient objects . to draw a meaningful comparison , we compare it with a sample of slow - evolving slsne  i at low redshift ( z@xmath00.2 ) .",
    "there are three objects that share very similar characteristics that make up this comparison - sn  2007bi @xcite , ptf12dam @xcite , sn  2015bn @xcite .",
    "these objects all have rest - frame spectra coverage up to at least 8000   and late time spectroscopy and photometry up to 400 days .",
    "we will also discuss the higher redshift , and perhaps more extreme ps1 - 14bj @xcite .",

    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of lines were determined after spectrum normalisation .",
    "however , we caution that the normalised continuum has sn flux contamination and therefore the ew of each line is a minimum value ( rather than a real line strength compared to the galaxy continuum ) .",

    "we believe the discrepancy is due to the low s / n of the lines with a large sn flux contamination and hence we do not use the @xmath43[o  ii ] .",
    "we used the open - source python code pymcz from @xcite to alternatively calculate metallicity of the host of lsq14an with different strong line calibrations , and we listed them as follows : 12 + @xmath44(o / h ) = @xmath48 from the n2 method @xcite and 12 + @xmath44(o / h ) = @xmath49 of the o3n2 method @xcite . the r23 value of 0.9 is at an insensitive regime , so we do not use this scale here .",
