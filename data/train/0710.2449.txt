    "normally functioning system appears to be in a steady nonequilibrium state characterized by a given deviation from equilibrium and the entropy production .",
    "each state of a system has its own lifetime related to fluxes magnitudes and sources strengths and therefore its deviation from equilibrium .",
    "raising lifetime to the realm of the macroscopic observables in @xcite means more than the extension of the set of macroscopical , reflects possible complication of the structure of the phase space that can contain domains of different behaviour ( for example , attractors with anomalously big lifetimes etc ) . from the random processes",
    "theory it follows that the existence and finiteness of a lifetime is provided by the existence of stationary states , physically meaning the existence of stationary structures . in the theory of random processes by defining concept of which it is possible to construct the theory of random processes , the concept of the moments of a stop to which a lifetime concerns also serves .",
    "the events bearing the information on system , - from the outside or outside , - create a stream of time in system . the moments of a birth and death are allocated .    a number of the important phenomena ( in the theory of phase transitions , in chemical reactions , in research of dynamics of complex biomolecules , calculation of factor of superficial diffusion in semiconductors , in researches of nucleus , elementary particles , in spin glasses , spectroscopy , in systems with traps , in the theory of metastable states , etc . )",
    "it is physically caused by finiteness of a lifetime of system , opportunities of those greater fluctuations in behaviour of the statistical system , having small probability , which , as a rule , are not considered at the description of evolution of system .",
    "the lifetime is the time period till the moment of the first ( random ) achievement @xcite a certain level ( for example , zero level ) by a random process @xmath0 for macroscopical parameter of system ( for example , its energy or number of particles ) .",
    "lifetime is the subordinated random process in terminology of the theory of random processes @xcite ; the behaviour of lifetime @xmath1 is defined by behaviour of random process @xmath0 :",

    "we do not consider ideal system of the infinite sizes , we do not do thermodynamic limiting transition .",

    "the parameter @xmath61 , connected with value @xmath123 , depends on a specific task .",
    "so , for prompt neutrons in a nuclear reactor @xcite @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is multiplicative factor of neutrons , @xmath126 is average lifetime of neutrons without perturbation , in not making multiple copies environment . in problems of phase synchronization @xcite @xmath127 } { \\exp\\{\\pi d_{0}\\}|i_{id_{0}}(d)|^{2}}$ ] , where @xmath128 is a strip of synchronization ( keeping ) of the connected generators ,",

    "too it is possible to consider value @xmath132 as parameter of distribution , having assumed , that this value represents average value of a random variable @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath134 . to prove introduction of value @xmath133 it is possible , for example , following work @xcite , where the operator of time ( fair and for a classical case ) , representing fluctuating time is entered ; `` usual '' time enters the name in @xcite as average value of the operator of time .",
    "one more opportunity of a ground of introduction of a random variable @xmath133 is connected with the initial moment @xmath9 . if value @xmath9 is already average on some parameters , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "thus , in expressions ( [ life ] ) , ( [ con2 ] ) , @xmath137 , instead of value @xmath83 as average value appears value @xmath1 , and the random variable @xmath1 is replaced with a random variable @xmath133 . as in a stationary case , at @xmath138 and @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "thus @xmath142 ( this correlation gives expression for a thermal capacity ) , @xmath143 .",
    "for lifetime in a method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator @xcite the past which has been last lifetime @xmath144 , age of system , figure 1 , where @xmath11 is the moment of a birth of system , @xmath8 is a present moment of time , @xmath145 is the moment of destruction of system , @xmath146 is number of particles in system during the moment @xmath8 , @xmath147 is future lifetime , is considered .",
    "full lifetime , the period of employment in terminology of the theory of queuing , is equal @xmath148 is the sum of the past and the future .",
    "averaging on the last lifetime known unlike the uncontrollable future , communicates in @xcite with causality , a sign on a source in the equation for nso and signs on local entropy production .",
    "it is shown , that quasi - equilibrium distribution ( [ relev ] ) , depending on parameter @xmath1 , it is possible to write down in exponent a kind ( [ exp2 ] ) , ( [ life ] ) . generally distribution ( [ life ] ) is entered irrespective of distributions ( [ relev ] ) and ( [ onepar ] ) and from nso , and argument @xmath1 in it can be the value which is distinct from @xmath149 . therefore it is difficult to tell , what distribution more the general : ( [ life ] ) or nso ( [ nso ] ) .    in @xcite",
    "it is marked , that the nonequilibrium state is characterized by additional macroscopical parameter in the description of system . in works @xcite it was marked , that the state of system in a present situation of time depends on all previous evolution of the nonequilibrium processes developing it and , accordingly , from time of the last life of system , its age . in works",
    "@xcite dynamics of behaviour of system and the contribution of correlations during all past of system is considered .",
    "therefore we choose random lifetime of system as thermodynamic parameter .",
    "the structure of phase space generally accepts rough ( fractal ) a kind caused by explosive spasmodic character of stochastic dynamics in it .",
    "lifetime is macroscopical value . as the open systems",
    "for which during their interaction with an environment there is the `` exchange '' in dynamic values breaking their conservation and doing them random , introduction of lifetime as a basic random variable , it is obviously important also a necessary element of the correct description of the nonequilibrium phenomena are considered .",
    "it is mean explaining what is understood under the notion of a first - passage time or lifetime .",
    "arbitrary systems are formed from elements , particles , or elementary objects .",
    "these elements enter any system and leave it .",
    "it is possible to formulate the notion of a lifetime with mathematical strictness ; one thus understands the time period at which the elements are present in a system .",
    "for example , if we consider a small volume cell of a gas , its lifetime is the period till all molecules occasionally leave this cell .",
    "are examples borrowed from chemical kinetics are times at which the number of molecules of certain kind becomes zero , time of the dissociation of a two - atom molecule , the age of a ( biological ) system , residence times of grains in sand - pile models etc .",
    "stratonovich in @xcite used the term `` lifetime '' as terminus techniques with respect to the number of phenomena considered .",
    "following synonyms are encountered by us : the first passage time ( for some given level ) , escape time , first - exit time , busy period ( in the queuing theory ) etc . the physical value of lifetime of system , as an interval of time during which at system there is a nonzero number of elements of which the statistical system is made is entered into consideration .",
    "this value depends both on internal properties of system , and from external influences and is generally a random variable .",
    "the lifetime is connected with characteristic time intervals of system ( time of collisions , time of mixture , time of a relaxation , etc . ) and with fluxes ( also time characteristics ) .",
    "the theory with lifetime generalizes approaches @xcite , r.l.stratonovich @xcite and the extended nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite . the analogy to internal time",
    "@xcite is spent .",
    "introduction of lifetime opens opportunities for strict studying the nature of time and allows to receive the description of transfer processes and other nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "so , in works @xcite lifetime of finite mods of laser systems connection with correlation time of amplitudes of mods .",
    "average lifetime of laser mods is determined experimentally on spectra of absorption .",
    "the connection of value @xmath1 is formally essential to a developed method , as subordinated process , with the basic random process @xmath59 .",
    "but the concept of lifetime has as well deep physical sense , uniting newton the approach by absolute time and ideas about a matter generating time .",
    "the parameter of lifetime unites the features inherent in usual dynamic variables like energy , number of particles , and to coordinate variables of type of time .",
    "the mathematical party of introduction of lifetime consists in reception of the additional information on stochastic process , except for knowledge of its stationary distribution , on stationary properties detailed of it the subordinated process .",
    "irreversibility in this approach appears as consequence of the assumption of existence and finiteness of lifetime of system , detailed the moments of a birth and destruction of system .",
    "physical values , for example , a thermal capacity of system , can essentially depend on lifetime .",
    "so if to assume , that in system it is realized lifetimes belonging only some area @xmath150 ( it , for example , it is fair for metastable states ) the contribution to the measured value is given with values @xmath151 , those areas of phase space , where @xmath152 are accessible only ( or , on the contrary , @xmath153 are accessible only ; instead of time of supervision @xmath154 there can be other characteristic scale ) average value , for example , energy is given by expression @xmath155 .",
    "thus as @xmath150 , and expression under last integral , can depend on temperature as on a regular basis , and with features , characteristic for phase transitions , when jump the whole areas of phase space become accessible ( or inaccessible ) system .",
    "dependence @xmath150 from temperature is connected with nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "detailed mesoscopical description can be received with use of obvious stochastic models of system , for example , diffusion type @xcite or stochastic processes of storage @xcite .",
    "the last can be considered as the models of the system raised by generalized noise . in them",
    "interaction with thermostat ( reservoir ) , and also the moments of degeneration and loss stationarity is considered at performance of the certain conditions .",
    "introduction of lifetime as thermodynamic parameter speaks that real systems possess finite lifetime that essentially influences their properties and properties of their environment .",
