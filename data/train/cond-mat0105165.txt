    "various experimental results for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 indicate a more complicated transition at @xmath15 : the bcs ratio of @xmath16 for the dimerization gap @xmath17 at zero temperature has the anomalously high value of @xmath18 .",
    "the phase transition consists of two very close transitions,@xcite and two inequivalent v sites were detected by nmr,@xcite and attributed to v@xmath10 and v@xmath11 .",
    "this has motivated both theoretical and experimental work , proposing a pure charge ordering ( co ) instability@xcite or co coupled to sp distortion.@xcite recently , the space group @xmath19 for the low - temperature crystal structure was determined from x - ray scattering data,@xcite and three inequivalent v sites in the v@xmath10 , v@xmath11 , and v@xmath20 oxidation states were proposed.@xcite since this space group is incompatible with the nmr measurement the low - temperature crystal structure and the charge ordering pattern are still under discussion.@xcite    charge ordering can be viewed as a wigner - crystallization on a lattice,@xcite which is caused by long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "thus different models with nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsions were studied@xcite and an in - line@xcite and a zig - zag structure@xcite for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 were proposed .",
    "the calculation of excitation spectra is a powerful test for these models , as they can be directly compared with experimental data .",

    "lda band structure calculations@xcite and estimations based on empirical rules@xcite lead to similar values of the hopping amplitudes @xmath61 , @xmath62 perpendicular to and along the ladders . however , there are significantly different estimations of the interladder hopping @xmath63 .",
    "a small value of @xmath64ev is found in lda calculations.@xcite additional evidence for a small @xmath63 follows from the weak magnetic dispersion along the @xmath7-axis as observed by neutron scattering.@xcite on the other hand , a much larger value of @xmath65ev was found from an estimation in ref .",

    "the lanczos approach is limited to small systems , and a cluster consisting of two ladders with four rungs [ cluster ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "[ ebene ] ] has been used in ref .  .",
    "however , when a calculation is restricted to finite systems , finite - size effects may distort the results .",
    "finite - size effects affect delocalized excitations , which are important if the hopping parameters @xmath27 are large , and/or the momentum transfer @xmath41 is small .",
    "for that reason , the loss function @xmath67 for small @xmath41 is sensitive to finite - size effects .",
    "the calculation of the optical conductivity @xmath53 is even more problematic , as it is obtained from @xmath52 in the limit @xmath68 [ see eq .  ] . since the importance of delocalized excitations",
    "can be decreased by increasing @xmath41 , we first study finite - size effects of the loss function @xmath67 ( sec .  [ finite ] ) .",
    "already at finite @xmath41 we observe large effects even when a rather small value of the interladder hopping @xmath63 is used .",
    "this also means that the optical conductivity for the same cluster with a larger value of @xmath63 is even more affected by finite - size effects ( see sec .",
    "[ optic ] ) .",
    "consequently , we can show that the results for the optical conductivity from ref .   are not converged and can not be used to support a large value of @xmath63 .    in the following",
    ", we shall use the hopping parameters ( @xmath69ev , @xmath70ev , @xmath64ev ) and the on - site hubbard interaction ( @xmath71ev ) from ref .",
    "up to now the values of the intersite coulomb interactions @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are not known exactly .",
    "therefore we choose moderate values for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , so that the system is close to the quantum critical point caused by charge ordering.@xcite",
    "to investigate finite - size effects , one has to use clusters of different size .",
    "however , the cluster consisting of two ladders with four rungs [ ( 1 ) in fig .  [ ebene ] ] is the largest to which the standard lanczos algorithm can be applied at present .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to enlarge the cluster in the direction of the momentum transfer , and to reduce it in perpendicular direction ( so that the number of sites is kept constant ) . of course , first one has to check that one does not distort the results by reducing the cluster perpendicular to the momentum transfer . to show this we use the effective @xmath29-@xmath14-@xmath30 model with the above values of @xmath27 and @xmath26 from ref .",
    "the intersite coulomb interactions are chosen @xmath75ev , @xmath76ev , and @xmath77ev .",
    "first we compare the loss function of the original cluster [ indicated by ( 1 ) in fig .",

    "the first consists of two ladders with two rungs for momentum transfer @xmath41 parallel to @xmath7 direction .",
    "the second cluster is an isolated ladder with four rungs for @xmath41 parallel to @xmath8 direction .",
    "note that periodic boundary conditions for these two smaller clusters make only sense in direction of the momentum transfer .",
    "therefore we choose open boundary conditions perpendicular to the momentum transfer .",
    "moreover , for the first of the two smaller clusters ( momentum transfer in @xmath7 direction ) one has to use renormalized intersite coulomb interactions @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this follows from a straightforward analysis of the influence of adjacent rungs on the same ladder .",
    "the results for the different clusters are shown in fig .",

    "( note that we use a small interladder hopping @xmath63 . )",
    "now we can study finite - size effects by increasing the two smaller clusters in the direction of momentum transfer . in this way we obtain clusters ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in fig .",

    "this clearly demonstrates that the original cluster ( 1 ) in fig .",
    "[ ebene ] , which is formed of two ladders with four rungs , is not large enough to allow reliable conclusions .    to test",
    "if there are still finite size - effects for clusters ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we next compare the spectra for closed and open boundary conditions in direction of momentum transfer . in the case of open boundary conditions",
    "one has to make sure that electrons on the edges of the cluster are still embedded in the local coulomb potential that results from a zig - zag ordered state . for this purpose , sites on the edge of cluster ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ ebene ] are assigned an additional on - site energy @xmath74 .",
    "sites on the edges of cluster ( 3 ) that are not occupied in a zig - zag charge ordered state need an additional on - site energy @xmath73 .",

    "<S> we calculate the electron - energy loss spectrum and the optical conductivity for nav@xmath0o@xmath1 using the standard lanczos algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the vanadium ions in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 form a system of coupled ladders which can be described by a quarter - filled extended hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> since this system has a large unit cell , one has to be very careful to avoid finite - size effects in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show this by performing exact diagonalization of different clusters with up to 16 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated loss function for the extended hubbard model shows good agreement with experimental spectra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a qualitative description of the optical conductivity is obtained with the same hamiltonian , and the same set of model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the experiment shows that interladder hopping is of minor importance for a realistic description of charge excitations in nav@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the character of the excitations depends strongly on the direction of momentum transfer .    2 </S>"
