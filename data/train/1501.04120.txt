    "during both world wars the baltic sea was a scene of intense naval warfare and became a `` container '' for almost whole nazi chemical munition arsenal . in accordance with the provisions of the potsdam conference ,",
    "germany was demilitarized but only a small part of their arsenal was neutralized on land .",
    "technologies for safe and effective disposal of chemical weapons were not known shortly after the war .",
    "thus , till 1948 about 250000 tons of munition , including up to 65000 tons of chemical agents , were sunk in baltic sea waters by both germans and allies .",
    "the main known contaminated areas are little belt , bornholm deep ( east of bornholm ) and the south - western part of the gotland deep  @xcite .",
    "apart from known underwater stockyard there is unknown amount of dangerous war remnants spread over the whole baltic , especially along maritime convoys paths and in vicinity of coasts .",
    "it is not clear how dangerous are these underwater arsenals . at the bottom of the sea ( in approx .",
    "5 - 7@xmath0c ) the chemical agents take a form of oily liquids hardly soluble in water .",
    "thus , the sunk ammunition does not release hazardous substances .",
    "it becomes dangerous however , if the rusted tanks and shells are raised from the bottom of the sea .",
    "chemical munitions , containing mostly mustard gas , was fished several times by fishermen on the baltic sea over the last fifty years . moreover , already in 1952 and 1955 the contamination was found at the polish coast causing serious injuries to people .",
    "it was estimated that if only @xmath1 of the sunk chemical agents was released into baltic the life in the sea and at its shores would be entirely ruined for the next 100 years  @xcite .",
    "high economic and environmental costs have been preventing so far any activities aiming at extraction of these hazardous substances , but it is clear that we are about to face a very serious problem in the baltic sea .",
    "appropriate actions for preventing the ecological catastrophe demand a precise knowledge of location and amount of sunk munitions .",
    "+ presently used methods for underwater munition detection is based on sonars which show only a shape of underwater objects , like e.g. sunk ships or depth charges . to estimate the amount of dangerous substances and to determine the exact location of sunk munition it is still necessary that people are diving and searching the bottom of the sea .",
    "this operation is always very dangerous for divers since the corrosion state of the shells is usually not known .",
    "moreover , these methods are very expensive and slow , thus they can not be used in practice to search big sea areas .",
    "the above mentioned disadvantages can be to large extend overcome by using devices based on neutron activation analysis techniques ( naa ) which will be discussed in more details in next sections of this article .",
    "most of the commonly used explosives or drugs are organic materials . therefore , they are composed mostly of oxygen , carbon , hydrogen and nitrogen .",
    "war gases contain also sulfur , chlorine , phosphorus and fluorine .",
    "thus , these substances can be unambiguously identified by the determination of the ratio between number of c , h , n , o , s , p and f atoms in a molecule , which can be done noninvasively applying neutron activation analysis techniques .",
    "the suspected item can be irradiated with a flux of neutrons produced using compact generators based e.g. on deuteron - tritium fusion , where deuterons are accelerated to the energy of 0.1 mev and hit a solid target containing tritium . as a result of the fusion an alpha particle",
    "is created together with the neutron , which is emitted nearly isotropically with a well defined energy equal to about 14.1 mev  @xcite .",
    "such energy is sufficient to excite all nuclei composing organic substances and the resulting @xmath2 quanta from the de - excitation of nuclei are then detected by e.g. a germanium detector providing a very good energy resolution . counting the number of gamma quanta emitted by nuclei from the examined item",
    "provides information about its stoichiometry .",
    "devices using naa to detect explosives on the ground were already designed and are produced , e.g. in usa  @xcite and poland  @xcite . in the aquatic environment however we encounter serious problems since neutrons are strongly attenuated by water . moreover , as in the case of ground detectors , an isotropic generation of neutrons induces a large environmental background , in this case from oxygen .",
    "this noise can be significantly reduced by the requirement of the coincident detection of the alpha particle , which allows for the neutron tagging  @xcite .",
    "the attenuation of neutrons can be compensated by decreasing the distance between generator and examined item  @xcite .",
    "there are also solutions based on low energy neutrons which are moderated in water before reaching the tested object .",
    "the detector is then counting the gamma quanta from thermal neutron capture and secondary neutrons originating from the irradiated object .",
    "the identification is done by searching for anomalies in the observed spectra of gamma quanta and neutrons  @xcite .",
    "however , these methods do not allow to detect explosives buried deeply in the bottom of the sea .",
    "moreover , the device has to approach the suspected item very close and the strong attenuation of neutrons and gamma quanta significantly increases the exposure time and make the interpretation of results difficult .",
    "therefore , we propose to build a detector which uses naa technique and special guides for neutrons and emitted gamma rays  @xcite .",
    "the device allows for detection of dangerous substances hidden deep in the bottom of the sea with significantly reduced background and provides determination of the density distribution of the dangerous substance in the tested object .",
    "scheme of the proposed device is presented in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "quanta , while registration of an @xmath3 particle in anti - coincidence with gamma quanta detector allows to reduce background .",
    "b )  demonstration of how changing of the relative position between neutron and @xmath2 quanta guides provides a tomographic image of the interrogated object.,width=340 ]    neutron generator collides deuterium ions with a tritium target producing a neutron and an @xmath3 particle . because of the much higher energy released in this reaction compared to the energy of deuterium , both particles are produced almost isotropically and move back - to - back .",
    "the @xmath3 particle is detected by a system of position sensitive detectors , e.g. silicon pads or scintillation hodoscope , disposed on the walls of the generator .",
    "neutrons emitted towards the subject of interrogation fly inside a guide built out of a stainless steal pipe filled with low pressure air or some other gas having low cross section for neutron interaction .",
    "neutrons after leaving a guide may be scattered inelastically on atomic nuclei in the tested substance .",
    "the nuclei deexcite and emit gamma quanta with energy specific to the element .",
    "part of the emitted @xmath2 quanta fly towards a dedicated detector within an analogous guide which decrease their absorption and scattering with respect to gamma quanta flying in water",
    ". the @xmath2 ray detector could be again a position sensitive detector measuring the energy , time and impact point of impinging particles .",
    "if the diameter - to - length ratio of both guides is small the depth at which @xmath2 quanta excite nuclei can be determined by measuring the time @xmath4 elapsed from the @xmath3 particle registration until the time of the @xmath2 quantum registration .",
    "generated neutrons travel with known velocity @xmath5 the distance @xmath6 from the tritium target to the point of interaction .",
    "similarly the gamma emitted from the tested object fly over a distance @xmath7 with a speed of light @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath4 can be expressed as : @xmath9 if we know the positions of the generator target and @xmath2 ray detector and lengths of both guides the distance @xmath10 covered by neutrons from the end of the guide to the point of interaction can be calculated as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the length of guides for neutrons and @xmath2 quanta , respectively .",
    "additional information on the depth of interaction is given by changing the relative position of the guides and the angle @xmath14 between them . as it is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a ) and b ) changing the distance between the guides provides registration of gamma quanta emitted from different parts of the object .",
    "this allows one to determine the density distribution of elements building the suspected object . in order to remove background resulting from interaction of neutrons emitted in other directions only signals registered by the @xmath2 quanta detector in coincidence with signals from @xmath3 particle detectors mounted in - line with the neutron guide",
    "are saved , while the other coincidences are discarded .",
    "taking into account cross section for neutron inelastic scattering with different nuclides and the detection efficiency of @xmath2 quanta we can reconstruct the number of atoms of each element building the object and compare them with the known stoichiometry of hazardous substances stored in the database .",
    "the whole detection unit can be mounted on a small submarine steered remotely from a ship .",
    "in order to optimize the dimensions and relative positions of detectors and guides we have developed dedicated open source software package written in the c++ programming language and based on the monte carlo simulation methods .",
    "our goal is to create a fast and user - friendly tool using novel methods of geometry definition and particle tracking based on hypergraphs  @xcite .",
    "the simulation framework is written using the c++11 standard and open mpi library  @xcite supporting parallel computing and it is destined for unix - like operating systems . the application needs to be configured with input file defining scene description ( location and shape of all objects included in simulation , as well as substances building them ) , and neutron source parameters ( location , number of generated neutrons and their energies ) .",
    "the parameters of neutron interaction with selected nuclei , e.g. total cross sections , neutron and @xmath2 quanta angular distributions and multiplicities , are parametrized as a function of neutron energy using data from the endf database  @xcite .",
    "similarly , gamma quanta energies were taken from the evaluated nuclear structure data files ( ensdf )  @xcite .",
    "this information is stored in an sqlite database and recalled during the simulation only for elements specified by user .",
    "so far we have implemented only main processes induced by 14.1  mev neutrons which we are interested in , i.e. elastic and inelastic scattering and radiative capture , but in the near future the simulations will be supplemented with other processes , e.g. fission . at present neglected processes are taken into account effectively as one process after which neutron is no longer tracked .",
    "cross section for this process is calculated in a way that the sum of all processes induced by neutron is equal to the total cross section for a given nuclei with which the reaction occurred .",
    "neutrons are tracked according to the algorithm presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] until they reach the scene boundary or their energy goes below the lowest included in the database  10  kev . ] , i.e. @xmath15  ev  @xcite . the reaction place is randomly generated with exponential probability distribution taking into account total cross section values from the database and concentrations of all the isotopes building the substance  .",
    "user can choose to calculate concentrations for a single chemical compound or a mixture of substances for a specified density .",
    "selection of an isotope with which the interaction took place is also random and it is done again based on neutron total cross sections and known stoichiometry of the material in which the reaction is simulated . next",
    "the reaction type is drawn according to cross section values for each process from the list specified by user in the input file .",
    "the direction of neutron after the reaction is generated using angular distributions parametrized with legendre polynomials or using uniform distribution if there is no relevant data in the database .",
    "it is first determined in the center of mass system and then the four - momentum is transformed back to the laboratory coordinate system . in case of inelastic scattering neutron energy in the laboratory is calculated taking into account the nuclei excitation energy . in the current version of simulations",
    "we take into account up to tenth excited nuclei level .",
    "directions of gamma quanta coming from the nuclei deexcitation are currently generated uniformly in the laboratory frame .",
    "+ as a starting point for design of the device for underwater threats detection we have defined a simple setup with point - like source generating 14.1  mev neutrons uniformly in space .",
    "the scheme of the simulated setup with superimposed points of of neutrons interaction are shown in figs .",
