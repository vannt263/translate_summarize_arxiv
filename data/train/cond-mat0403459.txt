    "indeed , a theory of spin and orbital states in cubic vanadates predicted quasi 1d spin - orbital correlations due to a spontaneous breaking of the cubic symmetry in the se model.@xcite    it is our aim to outline a unified picture that links optical and magnetic properties at orbital degeneracy .",
    "starting from the low - energy spin - orbital model we derive _ partial sum rules _ for the different excited states .",

    "the se interaction in a cubic mott insulator with ions having orbital degrees of freedom has a generic form , @xmath9 and consists of separate spin ( @xmath10 ) and orbital ( @xmath11 ) interactions , and of a dynamical coupling between them ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "the first equality in eq . ( [ central ] ) follows from the optical sum rule for a given transition @xmath17 , and relates the kinetic energy @xmath22 to the optical conductivity @xmath23 for this band , while the second equality relates the associated kinetic energy to the se energy via the _ hellman - feynman theorem_.@xcite    experimental data is often presented in terms of an effective carrier number [ see , e.g. , eq . ( 2 ) of ref . ] , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the free electron mass , and @xmath26 is the volume per magnetic ion .",
    "this gives an _ optical sum rule _ as follows : @xmath27 each level @xmath17 of the multiplet represents an upper hubbard band with its own spin and orbital quantum numbers .",
    "the key point is that while full kinetic energy and corresponding total intensity may show only modest @xmath6-dependence and almost no anisotropy , the behavior of the individual transitions is much richer , and directly reflects the ground state correlations via the spin and orbital selection rules .",
