    "in the wake of the recent evidence for atmospheric @xmath0 oscillations by super - kamiokande @xcite , one of the crucial issues is to clarify whether the observed effect is due to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 ( sterile ) oscillations .",
    "the pure @xmath4 case is strongly disfavoured @xcite by chooz  @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite , while pure @xmath3 and @xmath5 oscillations are equally possible  @xcite . within the restrictions imposed by chooz",
    ", complicated mixtures of the three cases can also not be excluded experimentally @xcite@xcite .",
    "in fact , most models favouring the sterile neutrino interpretation @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite do suggest some ( small ) contribution from standard flavour oscillations . due to the fundamental implications of the existence of a sterile neutrino for new physics",
    ", we will assume that a separation power of 3 to 5 @xmath6 is desired to rule out the mainly sterile oscillation scenario , and that a significance of at least 5 @xmath6 is required to establish it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , we will review the current experimental status of the active versus sterile oscillation hypothesis .",
    "we will then give some arguments why it is likely that future improvements on these measurements by atmospheric and long baseline neutrino experiments will leave important loopholes in the confirmation of either of the two hypotheses , and how a modest admixture of @xmath3 to mainly @xmath5 oscillations can mimic the pure @xmath3 oscillation case .",
    "finally , we will show how these loopholes can be closed by using the ( positive or negative ) results from short or intermediate baseline @xmath1 appearance ( sibta ) experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will argue that this conclusion does not depend strongly on whether the lsnd observation of @xmath4 oscillations @xcite will be confirmed or not .",
    "if lsnd would be confirmed , a negative result in a sibta experiment would also unambigously exclude the interpretation of lsnd as indirect @xmath2 oscillations , therefore ruling out all oscillation scenarios invoking this option @xcite .",
    "this includes essentially all models trying to reconcile lsnd with the atmospheric and solar neutrino result in the standard 3-neutrino framework @xcite .",
    "results of neutrino oscillation experiments are often expressed in terms of an effective two flavour oscillation scheme with a mixing angle @xmath7 between the two flavours and a mass difference @xmath8 between the two relevant mass eigenstates .",
    "the most popular interpretation of the super - kamiokande results is to invoke maximal or close to maximal @xmath3 oscillations with a @xmath8 in the @xmath9 ev@xmath10 range .",
    "clearly , if this interpretation is correct , the low @xmath8 excludes any observation of a @xmath3 oscillation signal in current @xcite@xcite and future @xcite short baseline experiments .",
    "however , a significant @xmath4 contribution to the angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino result is not completely excluded , and even suggested by some of the models @xcite trying to reconcile the atmospheric neutrino anomaly with lsnd . in this case the constraint on @xmath11 could be considerably diluted , and @xmath1 appearance signals in short or intermediate baseline experiments could be possible .    alternatively , several theoretical models suggest the interpretation of the super - kamiokande results as @xmath5 oscillations . in this case",
    ", the sterile neutrino could either be the right - handed ( sterile ) partner of the left - handed ( active ) muon neutrino ( or its antiparticle ) , leading to maximal @xmath12 oscillations analogous to @xmath13 oscillations @xcite@xcite , or the light remnant of very massive neutrinos in gut extensions of the standard model usually involving extra neutrino multiplets @xcite@xcite .",
    "in most of these models the observation of @xmath5 oscillations could be further complicated by non - negligible admixtures of @xmath3 or @xmath4 oscillations .    since ,",
    "due to the high @xmath1 mass threshold , neither @xmath14 nor @xmath15 produce a visible charged current ( cc ) signal in super - kamiokande , the two cases are experimentally almost indistinguishable in the standard super - kamiokande analysis of e - like and @xmath16-like events @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , @xmath14 s do produce neutral current ( nc ) interactions while sterile neutrinos do not .",
    "this could lead to a visible distinction in two kinds of measurements : in the @xmath5 case the up / down asymmetry observed in the cc sample should also be present for nc events , while no nc up / down asymmetry should occur in the @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) case @xcite .",
    "this effect also yields differences for the up / down asymmetry in inclusive event samples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nc suppression in the @xmath5 case modifies the predicted nc / cc ratios @xcite .",
    "unfortunately a clean nc / cc separation is experimentally difficult , and the expected effects are diluted by the ( supposedly ) unaltered contribution from @xmath17 nc events .",
    "the cleanest way to identify nc events in super - kamiokande is to require a single @xmath18 from the process @xmath19 , with n being either a neutron or a proton below erenkov threshold .",
    "the @xmath18 is detected via its decay into two photons which convert and yield two electron - like ( double ) rings whose invariant mass is consistent with the @xmath18 mass .",
    "this procedure reduces statistics by so much that currently no significant measurement of the up / down asymmetry can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the ratio of two ring ( @xmath18-like , nc ) to single ring ( e - like , cc ) events compared to the prediction for the no oscillation case is measured to be @xcite @xmath20 where the systematic error is dominated by the poorly known single @xmath18 cross section , and the statistical error is based on 535 days ( 2 years ) of running .",
    "assuming an initial @xmath21 ratio of 2.0 , using the measured average @xmath21 ratio suppression of 0.63 @xcite , and assuming no background , the ratio in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is expected to be 1.00 for @xmath3 oscillations ( neither of the two contributions is affected ) , 0.75 for @xmath5 oscillations ( the @xmath18 contribution is suppressed ) , 0.75 for @xmath4 oscillations ( the @xmath22 contribution is enhanced ) , and 0.94 for mainly @xmath3 oscillations with a 10% @xmath4 contribution . if there is significant background contamination these differences will be further reduced .    in order to disentangle @xmath3 from @xmath5 at the 3 @xmath6 level , the combined statistical and systematic error",
    "must therefore be reduced to 8% or less .",
    "if a 10% @xmath4 contribution is allowed , the required maximal uncertainty is reduced to 6% . arbitrarily assuming 2140 days ( 8 years ) of running",
    ", the statistical error will be about 4% . in order not to exceed the 6% total error",
    "this implies a systematic uncertainty of the order of 5% or less .",
    "even with the planned measurement of the @xmath18 production cross section in the near detector of the k2k experiment @xcite this seems to be very hard to achieve .",
    "we therefore conclude that this measurement will probably yield a useful indication , but is unlikely to firmly establish one of the two options .",
    "similar arguments hold for the @xmath18 up / down asymmetry . from a simple extrapolation of existing data @xcite",
    ", it looks unlikely that this method will distinguish the two cases by more than about 2  standard deviations .    the possibility to separate @xmath14 and @xmath15 from the measurement of the inclusive up / down asymmetry of multiring events , which also depends on the suppression of the nc contribution ,",
    "is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here ,",
    "the statistical and systematic errors are smaller , but the differences are also small , again yielding a potential effect of about 2 @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 oscillations with a significant @xmath4 admixture could yield the same asymmetry as pure @xmath3 oscillations .",
    "none of the currently planned atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite has a @xmath1 detection efficiency which is sufficiently large to see a significant pure charged current oscillation signal .",
    "in addition to the small cross section ( @xmath1 mass threshold ) , the unknown direction of the incoming neutrino makes a significant kinematical analysis ``  la nomad '' @xcite impossible .",
    "emulsion techniques ``  la chorus '' @xcite can not be used due to the inherently small target mass .    as in super - kamiokande , any efforts to distinguish between @xmath15 and @xmath14 must therefore focus on neutral current events or on inclusive event rates . in a detector like nice @xcite",
    "there is a small window at @xmath23 ev@xmath10 where the oscillation pattern could actually be resolved , opening the possibility of comparing the energy dependence of the cc and nc event rates .",
    "in addition , such a low @xmath8 would in itself be an indication for oscillations into active neutrinos , since the sterile case is somewhat disfavoured for such low @xmath8 values due to earth matter effects which start to play a role @xcite .    ref .",
    "@xcite outlines an atmospheric neutrino detector concept which would allow to measure @xmath14 appearance via an enhancement of muon - less events from @xmath1 decays at the highest accessible neutrino energies , where @xmath1 production is least suppressed .",
    "the nice feature of this concept is that @xmath17 events are effectively filtered out , therefore removing most of the @xmath17 background and the @xmath3/@xmath4 ambiguity .",
    "combined with the nc suppression for @xmath15 this yields a @xmath3/@xmath5 separation of several standard deviations for @xmath24 ev@xmath10 or larger @xcite .",
    "for @xmath25 the sensitivity is significantly reduced ( oscillations of high energy @xmath0 s are suppressed ) , while for even lower @xmath8 the difference becomes marginal .    for the super - kamiokande most favoured case of @xmath26 ev@xmath10",
    "it is not clear at present whether the difficulties outlined above will allow to draw any firm conclusions concerning the distinction of active and sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "furthermore , no detector of the types discussed above has been endorsed or approved so far .    in principle",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath5 oscillations can also be distinguished through the distortion of the momentum spectra of upward going muons due to matter effects @xcite .",
    "no conclusion has been reached so far from ongoing experiments @xcite due to large systematic errors .",
    "it is not clear at present whether these measurements can be improved sufficiently well to eventually allow a clear distinction .",
    "the best way to establish the @xmath3 interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino result obviously seems to be the detection of @xmath14 appearance in long baseline accelerator experiments @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . here , appearance could be established either directly through the observation of @xmath1 production , or indirectly via an enhancement of the nc / cc ratio , together with the non - observation of a large electron appearance effect .",
    "but , it turns out that a positive @xmath1 signal in e.g. icarus @xcite , opera @xcite , or minos @xcite would _ not _ automatically prove the @xmath3 hypothesis for atmospheric neutrinos , unless the corresponding @xmath8 can be measured directly from this signal .",
    "the basic argument is that , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] , even a small @xmath3 contribution ( @xmath27 or larger ) at large @xmath8 ( order ev@xmath10 ) can yield a signal in long baseline experiments ( for both appearance and disappearance ) that is similar in size or even larger than the expected effect from maximal @xmath5 oscillations , and can therefore mimic maximal @xmath3 oscillations at small @xmath8 .",
    "this argument is discussed in detail below .",
    "one of the most general arguments brought forward in favour of @xmath5 oscillations in the context of some models @xcite@xcite is the possibility to combine a neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing pattern which are similar to the one observed in the quark and charged lepton sector ( i.e. third generation is heaviest , mixing angles are small ) with maximal @xmath5 oscillations , while retaining a significant contribution to hot dark matter . in mixed dark matter models",
    ", this would suggest a @xmath14 mass of order ev .",
    "similarity with the ckm matrix ( @xcite ) would suggest a @xmath30 of order @xmath31 ( e.g. test point 2 in fig . [",
    "fig : numunutau ] ) .",
    "once sterile neutrinos are considered at all this is in some sense a `` natural '' possibility which should not be dismissed a priori , although it is by no means a necessity . without requiring mass hierarchy , similar arguments for",
    "a possible @xmath32 admixture apply for the models of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if lsnd @xcite would be confirmed this argument would be strengthened further , since the observation of @xmath4 oscillations in the range @xmath33  ev@xmath10 , combined with the hierarchy assumption , would again suggest a @xmath14 mass in the ev range .",
    "in addition , it would make the sterile scenario more attractive , since the lsnd result is hard to combine with the evidence from atmospheric and solar neutrinos in a three neutrino scheme .",
    "however , the argument given in the previous paragraph does _ not _ vanish if lsnd would be disproven . instead",
    ", @xmath4 oscillations might play a significant role at lower @xmath8 , either as an admixture to mainly @xmath5 atmospheric neutrino oscillations or as the solution of the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "finally , let us digress and consider the case of indirect @xmath2 oscillations in lsnd @xcite@xcite .",
    "assuming mass hierarchy and denoting the dominant mass components of @xmath17 , @xmath0 and @xmath14 by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 yields the mass relation @xmath37 known as one mass scale dominance @xcite . in order for indirect oscillations to be detectable",
    ", @xmath38 must be in the range relevant for lsnd , i.e. of order 1 ev@xmath10 , and the rate proportional to @xmath39 must be sufficiently large . here , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the relevant matrix elements of the general 3 neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "bounds on @xmath40 from bugey @xcite combined with the lsnd measurement of the rate in eq .",
    "( 2 ) yield a prediction for @xmath41 as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "all possible solutions are close to the limit from cdhs @xcite .",
    "two ( marginally ) allowed solutions , translated into @xmath30 , are shown as test points 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] .    test point 3 corresponds to a scenario very similar to that of test point 2 , where @xmath29 oscillations happen in addition to the @xmath28 oscillations responsible for the atmospheric neutrino deficit .",
    "it is therefore also relevant outside of the lsnd context .",
    "test point 4 represents the region of very large @xmath29 mixing used , among others , for the cardall / fuller , acker / pakvasa and thun / mckee schemes @xcite without the need for sterile neutrinos .      for the purpose of this study we will consider close to maximal @xmath0 disappearance of atmospheric neutrinos to be an established fact , and anticipate that this will be confirmed through a positive effect in the ratio of the @xmath0 cc rate in near and far detectors of the long baseline programme ( k2k @xcite , minos @xcite , nice @xcite , ... ) .",
    "whenever atmospheric @xmath3 or @xmath5 oscillations are mentioned in the next few paragraphs , it is understood that there could be a small ( up to 10% ) contribution from @xmath4 .",
    "a potentially even larger @xmath17 contribution is assumed to be measured and corrected for . finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] implies that very similar conclusions can be obtained from short and intermediate baseline experiments",
    ". we will therefore often refer to a generic short or intermediate baseline @xmath1 appearance ( sibta ) experiment in the discussion .",
    "* case ( a ) : long baseline experiments do not observe @xmath14 appearance . *    a positive signal in a sibta experiment would then _ establish _ that @xmath3 oscillations are outside of the range accessible to long baseline experiments , but within the range relevant to mixed dark matter ( e.g. test point 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] for the short baseline case ) , and _ force _ the @xmath5 interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino result .",
    "the measured long baseline disappearance rate would yield a measurement of the @xmath8 for @xmath5 oscillations , to be compared to the super - kamiokande result .",
    "a negative result in a sibta experiment would _ exclude _ any @xmath3 contribution to the long baseline signal from the cosmologically relevant range .",
    "it would therefore _ strongly suggest _ the @xmath3 interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations at the low end of the super - kamiokande allowed @xmath8 range , provided the observed long baseline disappearance signal ( from a low energy beam ) is consistent with this low @xmath8 hypothesis .",
    "* case ( b ) : long baseline experiments observe a small @xmath14 appearance signal .",
    "*    since the appearance signal is small ( e.g. a handful of events in the case of direct @xmath1 appearance ) , it would supposedly _ not _ be possible to reliably measure the @xmath8 from the energy distribution of the appearance signal alone .",
    "again , a positive signal in a sibta experiment would _ establish _ that @xmath3 oscillations occur in the cosmologically relevant range ( e.g. test point 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] ) , and _ force _ the @xmath5 interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino result .",
    "the combination of the sibta and long baseline results would unambigously fix the @xmath3 oscillation parameters .",
    "if the @xmath5 oscillations would occur at the super - kamiokande best fit point of @xmath42 ev@xmath10 ( sk ) , they would be partially masked by the @xmath3 signal in the long baseline disappearance search .",
    "on the other hand , if the disappearance rate would turn out to be significantly larger than the appearance rate ( @xmath43 ev@xmath10 ) , the former could be used to measure the @xmath8 of the @xmath5 oscillations .",
    "a negative sibta result would again _ exclude _ any @xmath3 contribution to the long baseline signal from the cosmologically relevant range , and therefore _",
    "strongly suggest _ the @xmath3 interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations with parameters close to the super - kamiokande best fit point .",
    "this can be cross - checked by requiring the appearance and disappearance rates to agree .",
    "the combination of the long baseline with the atmospheric neutrino results then yields a precise measurement of the @xmath3 oscillation parameters .",
    "* case ( c ) : long baseline experiments observe a large @xmath14 appearance signal .",
    "*    given a large @xmath3 appearance signal , it might be possible to extract @xmath8 from the energy distribution of the appearance signal alone , or at least to exclude a significant fraction of the available parameter space .",
    "however the example of the lsnd experiment @xcite shows that this possibility can not be taken for granted : despite a claimed excess of 50 events over a small background , lsnd is not able to differentiate the low and high @xmath8 cases for their @xmath4 oscillation signal .",
    "definitely , a low / high @xmath8 distinction at the 5 @xmath6 level would not be obvious for the long baseline results .",
    "the preference of the low @xmath8 case could e.g. suggest the @xmath3 interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino deficit with a @xmath8 in the kamiokande / super - kamiokande overlap region ( @xmath44 ev@xmath10 ) .",
    "the requirement of _ not _ observing a sibta signal would essentially _ eliminate _ the whole large @xmath8 range , including the regions suggested by dark matter and/or lsnd ( test point 3 ) , and therefore strongly enhance the confidence in the low @xmath8 result .",
    "compatibility of the observed long baseline appearance and disappearance rates , although required , would _ not _ yield any further separation power , since a large @xmath1 appearance signal from e.g. test point 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] would completely mask the atmospheric oscillation effect , and also yield a consistent appearance / disappearance rate .",
    "the preference of the high @xmath8 case would imply the interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly as mainly @xmath5 oscillations .",
    "if lsnd would be confirmed , it could in addition imply the compatibility of the @xmath3 oscillation parameters with the indirect oscillation hypothesis for lsnd ( test point 3 ) .",
    "given the importance of such a result , the cross - check from the requirement of a positive sibta result would be absolutely _",
    "essential_.    * case ( d ) : long baseline experiments observe a close to maximal ( @xmath45 ) @xmath14 appearance signal .",
    "*    such a signal would be really spectacular , and inconsistent with the analysis of the super - kamiokande data in terms of two flavour oscillations . since it would point to a @xmath8 larger than @xmath31 ev@xmath10",
    "it would either indicate a serious flaw in the super - kamiokande analysis , or require a three ( or more ) flavour scheme with significant contributions from two different @xmath8 , one high and one low .",
    "the energy distribution of the observed @xmath1 spectrum could already give a serious indication of the relevant high @xmath8 .",
    "the rate of a positive sibta signal would however unambigously fix the @xmath8 for @xmath3 oscillations , and could decide whether it corresponds to the cardall / fuller or thun / mckee solutions ( test point 4 ) or to some lower @xmath8 value",
    ".    a negative sibta result would _ constrain _ the @xmath8 to about @xmath46 ev@xmath10 .    in either case the up / down asymmetry pattern of the super - kamiokande data suggesting a significant low @xmath8 contribution would either have to be disproven , attributed to @xmath4 oscillations through a corresponding observation in long baseline experiments , or attributed to a complicated mixture of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 oscillations .",
    "as outlined in the cases discussed above , none of the scenarios discussed essentially requires the confirmation of lsnd . on the other hand",
    ", a confirmation of lsnd would significantly enhance the interest in the @xmath3/@xmath5 distinction , since the addition of one or more sterile neutrinos might then be the only solution to simultaneously describe all the data . also , the question whether the lsnd signal is caused by direct or indirect oscillations becomes very relevant . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : numunutau ] , a negative sibta signal would unambigously exclude the indirect oscillation possibility ( test points 3 and 4 ) , while a positive signal might allow it . a positive @xmath3 signal of kind ( c ) or ( d ) in the long baseline experiments could confirm this scenario , while a signal of kind ( b ) or ( a ) ( no signal ) would again exclude it .",
    "finally , reversing the argument , the observation or non - observation of a signal in a sibta experiment before the lsnd case is settled could , depending on the context of the results of other experiments , indirectly contribute to the lsnd verification .",
    "it has been shown that , whatever the outcome of future atmospheric and long baseline neutrino experiments , the complementary information from a short or intermediate baseline @xmath1 appearance experiment could be crucial for the unambigous interpretation of the long baseline results . such an experiment is therefore needed to distinguish cleanly between the @xmath3 and @xmath5 interpretations of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , and even a negative result is very relevant in this context . in the absence of this cross - check , a small @xmath3 contribution at high @xmath8 could mask the long baseline @xmath5 signal , therefore yielding a false confirmation of the interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in terms of @xmath3 oscillations .",
    "this conclusion does not depend on whether lsnd is confirmed or not , although a confirmation of lsnd would enhance the interest in resolving this ambiguity .",
    "if lsnd would be confirmed , a negative signal in such a short or intermediate baseline experiment would definitively rule out the indirect oscillation interpretation of the lsnd result .",
