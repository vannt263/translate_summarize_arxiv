    "planets are born from disks of gas and dust that surround newly formed stars .",
    "these disks exist around stars covering a wide range of masses and even have been found around objects at substellar masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the least massive brown dwarf discovered with a disk @xcite has a mass near the upper limit of extrasolar planetary companions ( @xmath9  @xmath4 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these measurements raise the question of whether even smaller brown dwarfs at planetary masses possess disks out of which planets might form .    the chamaeleon  i star - forming region is a prime location in which to search for planetary - mass brown dwarfs with disks .",
    "because of its close proximity to the sun ( @xmath10 - 170  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , substellar members of this cluster have relatively bright apparent magnitudes .",
    "in addition , the cluster is compact enough that it can be mapped in a reasonable amount of observing time .",
    "taking advantage of these attractive characteristics , we have obtained deep broad - band images of the southern subcluster in cha  i from 0.8 to 8  with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , the 4  m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory , and the _ spitzer space telescope_. in this letter , we describe these imaging observations , use the resulting photometry to identify a promising candidate brown dwarf with a disk , confirm it as a young brown dwarf with near - infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy , estimate its extinction , luminosity , and mass , and compare its mid - ir excess emission to our model predictions for emission from a circumstellar disk .",
    "we used the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard _ hst _ to image a @xmath11 area centered at a @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( j2000 ) during several dates in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "acs provided a plate scale of @xmath14  pixel  @xmath15 and a field of view of @xmath16 .",
    "the target area was imaged with a @xmath17 map of contiguous fields of view . at a given cell in the map",
    ", we obtained one 850  s exposure in the f775w filter ( 0.775  ) and one 350  s exposure in the f850lp filter ( 0.85  ) at each position in a 2-point dither pattern .",
    "the resulting images were processed and calibrated by automated software at the space telescope science institute . on the nights of 2004",
    "april 28 and 29 , we obtained images of a @xmath18 area centered at @xmath12 , @xmath19 ( j2000 ) with the infrared side port imager ( ispi ) at the 4  m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "ispi provided a plate scale of @xmath20  pixel  @xmath15 and a field of view of @xmath21 .",
    "the target area was imaged with a @xmath22 map of contiguous fields of view through the @xmath23 , @xmath1 , and @xmath24 filters ( 1.25 , 1.6 , 2.2  ) .",
    "at each cell in the map , short exposures were obtained at closely separated dither positions such that a total exposure time of 24  min was achieved in each filter .",
    "these data were processed using standard image reduction methods and were calibrated with photometry from the two micron all - sky survey . as a part of the guaranteed time observations of the instrument team for the infrared array camera ( irac ;",
    "* ) , we obtained images of two overlapping @xmath25 areas in cha  i at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  with irac aboard the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "the details of these observations and the analysis of the resulting data are provided by @xcite .",
    "we measured photometry for all point sources appearing in the acs , ispi , and irac images .",
    "we then searched these data for objects exhibiting the colors and magnitudes expected of brown dwarfs with disks .",
    "this was done by first identifying objects that appeared to be cool and faint according to diagrams of @xmath26 versus @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 versus @xmath29 @xcite . for these candidate brown dwarfs",

    "this process produced one promising candidate for a planetary - mass brown dwarf with a disk .",
    "the coordinates of the candidate are @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( j2000 ) and we assign to it the name cha  110913 - 773444 ( hereafter cha  1109 - 7734 ) . for this object ,",

    "the errors are 0.02 and 0.04 for the former seven and the latter two measurements , respectively .",
    "to determine if cha  1109 - 7734 is a young brown dwarf , we observed it spectroscopically with the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) at gemini south observatory during the nights of 2005 march 23 and 25 .",
    "the observing and analysis procedures were the same as those used for the chamaeleon brown dwarf ots  44 @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum of cha  1109 - 7734 is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the spectrum exhibits strong h@xmath41o absorption bands , demonstrating that cha  1109 - 7734 is a cool object rather than an early - type field star or an extragalactic source .",
    "both young brown dwarfs and low - mass field stars have cool atmospheres , but their surface gravities differ significantly .",
    "therefore , we can distinguish between these two possibilities for cha  1109 - 7734 by examining spectral features that are sensitive to gravity , such as the shapes of the @xmath1- and @xmath2-band continua that are induced by the h@xmath41o absorption bands and the strengths of na  i and k  i absorption lines @xcite . to do this ,",
    "we compare in figure  [ fig : spec ] the spectrum of cha  1109 - 7734 to gnirs data for the young brown dwarf ots  44 and the cool field dwarf lhs  2065 .",
    "cha  1109 - 7734 has a sharply peaked , triangular continuum and weak na  i and k  i lines like ots  44 rather than the broad plateau and strong absorption lines that characterize lhs  2065 . based on this comparison , we conclude that cha  1109 - 7734 is a young member of cha  i rather than a field dwarf in the foreground or the background of the cluster .",
    "further evidence of the youth and membership of cha  1109 - 7734 will be provided later in this work when we demonstrate that it has a disk .",
    "in addition to surface gravity , the spectral type of cha  1109 - 7734 is constrained by the h@xmath41o absorption bands .",
    "the strengths of these bands for cha  1109 - 7734 are similar to those of ots  44 , which was classified as @xmath0m9.5 through a comparison to an optically - classified young brown dwarf @xcite .",
    "we therefore apply this spectral type to cha  1109 - 7734 as well .",
    "because the variation of h@xmath41o absorption with optical spectral type is unknown for young objects later than m9 , we can place only a limit on the spectral type .",
    "now that cha  1109 - 7734 has been spectroscopically confirmed as a young brown dwarf , we estimate its extinction , luminosity , and mass . by comparing the near - ir spectrum and colors of cha  1109 - 7734 to those of the known brown dwarfs ots  44 ( @xmath42 , * ? ? ? * ) and kpno  4 ( @xmath43 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we derive an extinction of @xmath44 .",
    "we estimate a bolometric luminosity of log  @xmath45 for cha  1109 - 7734 by combining our measurement of @xmath1 , a distance modulus of 6.05 , an @xmath1-band bolometric correction of bc@xmath46 @xcite , and an absolute bolometric magnitude for the sun of @xmath47 .",
    "the combined uncertainties in @xmath48 , @xmath1 , bc@xmath49 , and the distance modulus ( @xmath50 , 0.02 , 0.2 , 0.13 ) correspond to an uncertainty of @xmath51 in log  @xmath52 .",
    "we convert the luminosity estimate to a mass using theoretical relationships between luminosity , mass , and age . for the age of cha  1109 - 7734",
    ", we adopt the median value of 2  myr exhibited by the known members of cha  i @xcite .",
    "these members are spread across a range of luminosities at a given temperature , which could reflect either a range of ages ( @xmath53 - 10  myr ) or other phenomena , such as extinction uncertainties , unresolved binaries , and variability .",
    "regardless of the source of this luminosity spread , we can account for it in our mass estimate by adopting lower and upper limits of 0.5 to 10  myr for the age of cha  1109 - 7734 . in diagrams of luminosity versus age in figure  [",
    "fig : lbol ] , we plot cha  1109 - 7734 with the luminosities predicted as a function of age for masses of 5 , 10 and 15  @xmath4 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cha  1109 - 7734 has a mass of @xmath3  @xmath4 according to both sets of evolutionary models .",
    "mass estimates of this kind are prone to systematic errors within the models @xcite , but these errors do not appear to be large if the models are used properly @xcite .",
    "thus , considering that the observed upper limit of extrasolar planetary companions is near 15  @xmath4 @xcite , the mass of cha  1109 - 7734 is very likely in the planetary regime . for comparison",
    ", we also include in figure  [ fig : lbol ] the young brown dwarfs kpno  4 and ots  44 .",
    "we have revised the previous luminosities of these objects @xcite using the values of bc@xmath49 and @xmath54 adopted in this work for cha  1109 - 7734 , arriving at log  @xmath55 and -2.85 for kpno  4 and ots  44 , respectively .",
    "cha  1109 - 7734 is more than twice as faint as ots  44 , which is the least massive brown dwarf known to have a disk prior to this study @xcite .",
    "cha  1109 - 7734 was originally identified as an object that might have a disk on the basis of mid - ir colors that were suggestive of excess emission from cool dust .",
    "we now examine this evidence of a disk in more detail .",
    "as done in our previous analysis of the disk - bearing brown dwarf ots  44 @xcite , we use the young brown dwarf kpno  4 to represent the stellar photosphere of cha  1109 - 7734 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we plot the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , @xmath56 , for cha  1109 - 7734 after an extinction correction of @xmath42 .",
    "the sed of kpno  4 is scaled to match the @xmath1-band flux of cha  1109 - 7734 and is included in figure  [ fig : sed ] . as in the case of ots  44 @xcite ,",
    "the fluxes of cha  1109 - 7734 are photospheric in the optical and near - ir bands , while significant excess emission is present at wavelengths longer than 5  .",
    "we compared this excess emission from cha  1109 - 7734 with the predictions of a model of an irradiated accretion disk .",
    "for these calculations , we adopted a stellar mass of @xmath57  @xmath4 , a stellar radius of @xmath58  @xmath59 , a uniform grain size distribution characterized by the standard power law @xmath60 with minimum and maximum grain sizes @xmath61  and @xmath62  @xcite , a uniform mass accretion rate , and a disk inclination of @xmath63 .",
    "standard disk models include a vertical wall at the dust destruction temperature of 1400  k. however , because of the low luminosity of cha  1109 - 7734 , the dust destruction radius is @xmath64  @xmath65 . under the assumption that magnetospheric accretion is taking place in this object ,",
    "we have truncated the disk and placed the wall at a typical magnetospheric radius of @xmath66  @xmath65 @xcite , which corresponds to a temperature of 1300  k. for the height of the disk wall we have used @xmath67  @xmath65 , which was derived from equations in @xcite .",
    "descriptions of the method used to calculate the disk structure and emergent intensity are provided in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we find that models with accretion rates of @xmath68  @xmath8 produce too much mid - ir excess emission .",
    "meanwhile , we can place only an upper limit of @xmath7  @xmath8 on the accretion rate because irradiation rather than accretion dominates the heating of the inner disk for @xmath69  @xmath8 . in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we show the disk sed produced by the model with @xmath70  @xmath8 , which fits the observed excess emission reasonably well .",
    "we have presented the discovery of the faintest brown dwarf known to harbor a circumstellar disk .",
    "our best estimate of the mass of this object ( @xmath71  @xmath4 ) places it within the mass range of extrasolar planetary companions ( @xmath72  @xmath4 ) . thus , the basic ingredients for making planets are present around free - floating planetary - mass bodies .",
