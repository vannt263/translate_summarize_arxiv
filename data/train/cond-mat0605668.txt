    "relaxation of spins in a paramagnetic solid is a problem of fundamental interest .",
    "it is also related to important applications such as spin resonance and the use of spin as a qubit . in a paramagnet ,",
    "the decay of a spin state is due to the interactions with phonons , nuclear spins , dipolar fields , etc . in principle",
    ", one could suppress the interaction with nuclear spins and dipolar fields but the interaction with phonons always remains .",
    "often it dominates spin relaxation .",
    "thus , spin - lattice interactions provide the most fundamental upper bound for the lifetime of spin states in paramagnets .",
    "the spin relaxation due to interaction with the lattice can occur by various mechanisms .",
    "the most studied and often the dominant ones are direct processes , in which a single quantum is exchanged between the spin system and the lattice .",
    "it was pointed out by waller in studying the modulation of the spin - spin interaction by the lattice waves that , unlike in electromagnetic phenomena , the inelastic scattering of a phonon combined with a transition in the spin system could be very important @xcite .",
    "this is a two - phonon process consisting of the absorption of one phonon and the emission of another phonon with different frequency .",
    "the mechanism is analogous to the raman effect in optical spectroscopy and it is often referred to as a raman process .",
    "spin - lattice relaxation mechanisms based on dipolar interactions ( waller ) were insufficient , however , to account for the transition rates measured in experiment .",
    "heitler and teller @xcite considered raman processes based on a more potent mechanism based upon modulation of the crystal electric field under the action of the lattice vibrations .",
    "their theory was further developed by kronig @xcite and van vleck @xcite .",
    "they obtained a spin - phonon coupling based on the spin - orbit interaction that permitted calculation of relaxation rates that were of the same order of magnitude as the experimental ones . later on",
    ", orbach @xcite managed to simplify the treatment of the problem by expanding the crystal electric potential in powers of the fluctuating strain caused by the lattice vibrations .",
    "recently , this problem has received new attention in connection with spin relaxation of molecular clusters .",
    "the spin of many such clusters is formed inside a relatively rigid magnetic core that can rotate in the presence of the deformation field but is more resistant to distortions of the core itself .",
    "it has been noticed that the spin relaxation of such a cluster can be obtained within a model that is parameter free , that is , it gives the relaxation rates in terms of the known crystal field hamiltonian of the magnetic core @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "even for non - rigid clusters , calculation of the effect of rotations is meaningful .",
    "it has been theoretically established that spin - phonon relaxation rates due to both , one - phonon and multi - phonon processes , are inversely proportional to some high powers of the sound velocity . since longitudinal phonons have a larger sound velocity than the transverse phonons , processes involving longitudinal phonons can be safely neglected .",
    "the effects of the transverse phonons can be split into shear deformations of the lattice cell and local rotations of the lattice that preserve the symmetry of the crystal field . to describe deformations of the first kind",
    "one needs to employ terms in the hamiltonian containing phenomenological coupling constants , whereas the local rotations can be described by a parameter - free spin - phonon hamiltonian that is defined solely by the form of @xmath0 . in general , processes due to the shear distortion of the lattice and those due to the local rotation of the lattice should result in comparable relaxation rates . even in this case , the latter are of a fundamental importance because they provide a parameter - free lower bound on the decoherence of any spin - based qubit . for rigid spin clusters ,",
    "interaction of the spin with rotations of the crystal field is the only source of spin - lattice relaxation .",
    "the angle of rotation of the crystal field axes @xmath1 due to the action of the phonon field @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 because @xmath4 is a scalar , the rotation of @xmath5 is equivalent to the rotation of the vector @xmath6 in the opposite direction .",
    "as it is known , the rotation of the operator @xmath6 can be performed by the @xmath7 matrix in the spin space , @xmath8 then , the total hamiltonian in the presence of phonons can be written in the form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the crystal - field hamiltonian in the absence of phonons , @xmath11 is the zeeman hamitonian and @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of harmonic phonons . in these formulas",

    "+ for one - phonon processes , relaxation rates of spin - phonon transitions have been recently computed with the help of the above formalism in ref . .",
    "such processes dominate spin - phonon relaxation at zero temperature when no thermal phonons are present in the system . at finite temperature ,",
    "however , two - phonon processes may take over . in this paper",
    "we study two kinds of two - phonon processes .",
    "the first kind consists of an inelastic scattering of phonons by the spin - system , or spin - phonon raman processes .",
    "it corresponds to the annihilation of an incoming phonon of frequency @xmath20 and the creation of an outgoing phonon of frequency @xmath21 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being the corresponding wave vectors .",
    "the second kind involves emission of two phonons .",
    "note that the conservation of the energy in spin - phonon interactions requires @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy difference between the spin - states and @xmath26 are the frequencies of the phonons involved in the transition .",
    "the plus sign applies to processes involving the emission of two phonons and the minus sign applies to raman processes . when @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 being the debye frequency ) , eq.([energycons ] ) causes the phase space of phonons to be much greater for raman processes than for processes involving the emission of two phonons .",
    "consequently , the spin - phonon raman scattering usually dominates over the processes involving the emission of two phonons .",
    "however , the same condition ( [ energycons ] ) implies that the energy of the phonon emitted in the raman scattering process , @xmath29 , must satisfy @xmath30 , whereas in the process involving the creation of two phonons their energy must be smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath31 , the total number of phonons available to carry out the spin transition may be much greater in the two - phonon emission case than in the raman case , so that the former case can become dominant . in both cases the matrix element of the transition is a sum of two terms .",
    "the first term , @xmath32 , comes from the first order of the perturbation theory on the spin - phonon coupling containing a product of two phonon displacement fields .",
    "the second term , @xmath33 , comes from the second order of the perturbation theory on the spin - phonon coupling that is linear in the phonon displacement field . in some cases these two terms",
    "interfere , so that the resulting transition rate , based upon @xmath34 , is different from the one obtained by adding up the rates , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that each term would produce by itself , as was incorrectly done in the past .",
