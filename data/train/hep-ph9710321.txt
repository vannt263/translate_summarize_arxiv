    "<S> the factorization theorem predicts that @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks are produced with the same distributions and then fragment independently . </S>",

    "<S> alternatively , the final interaction of charm quark with spectator quarks may be responsible for the large asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the lund string fragmentation model implemented with this mechanism , pythia monte carlo program , reproduces the trends of increasing asymmetry with feynman @xmath8 , but the asymmetry is too large @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , vogt and brodsky took account of an intrinsic @xmath9 in projectile hadron state and predicted an asymmetry from coalescence of charm quarks with the comoving spectator quarks , in agreement with the data @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> a constituent quark ( diquark ) is a quark - gluon cluster consisting of the valence quark ( diquark ) , sea quarks and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> constituent quarks and diquarks play important roles in soft hadron interactions in contrast with parton quarks and gluons in hard interactions . </S>",

    "<S> two cascade chains are exchanged between the constituents in the beam and target hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the leading particle effect results from the first cascade step of the energetic valence constituents </S>",

    "<S> the model is found to be able to explain the strong asymmetry between leading and non - leading charmed meson productions . </S>",
