    "a variety of calibrations have been developed @xcite , enabling sfr estimations from  to a reasonable accuracy for star - forming galaxies .",

    "does  also indicate star formation in these galaxies ? it has long been realized that star formation is not the only possible source of  emission in galaxies .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agn - especially liners ) , fast shockwaves , post - agb stars , and cooling flows might also produce  emission .",
    "thus , before we use  as a universal star formation indicator , we need to know how often and to what degree  emission is contaminated by sources other than star formation , especially in red , elliptical galaxies .",
    "the assumption that  measures star formation has been fundamental to many studies .",
    "for instance , the lack of  is often used as a criterion for post - starburst galaxy identification .",
    "post - starburst galaxies , as their name suggests , are galaxies that underwent a strong recent star formation epoch but have stopped forming stars . their spectra can be modeled by a combination of an old stellar population ( similar to that of a k giant star or an early - type galaxy ) and a young population which is dominated by a stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , these galaxies are commonly known as ` k+a ' or ` e+a ' galaxies . with time",
    ", these galaxies will display an early - type galaxy spectrum after all the a stars die out in 1 gyr .",
    "thus , the study of these galaxies is important for understanding galaxy evolution , given the current uncertainty in how elliptical galaxies form .",
    "the identification of these post - starburst galaxies requires a total lack of emission lines , to be certain that star formation has truly stopped .",
    "most works on post - starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have used  as the marker , either because it is the only emission line diagnostic available at high redshifts or for the sake of facilitating comparisons between low and high redshifts and among different authors . recently ,",
    "several groups @xcite have employed  emission as the marker for star formation , rather than , for samples of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "usually , a low equivalent width ( ew ) threshold on , e.g. , 2.5 , is used as the criterion for non - detection of such emission lines , according to the sensitivity in each survey .",
    "this reflects an underlying assumption that any emission line would be coming from starforming regions .",
    "if this assumption fails to hold  for instance , if the contribution of  from agn is significant  the post - starburst sample defined by such a method would be incomplete because agn would be mistakenly discarded as star - forming galaxies .",
    "thus , using  in post - starburst galaxy studies requires a better understanding of the many origins of  in all types of galaxies .    in many studies of agns ,",
    "the opposite question is asked : what fraction of  emission in agn spectra comes from star formation ?",
    "a variety of studies of high - ionization agn ( qsos and seyferts ) have attempted to separate the contributions from agn and star formation to line emission .",
    "it is of special interest to the understanding of the coevolution of the nuclear black holes and the bulges .",
    "@xcite found by measuring the baldwin effects @xcite that most  emission in qsos might be from the host galaxies instead of the agn .",
    "@xcite found that dust - reddened qsos have stronger  emission than normal qsos .",
    "one of the many possible explanations is that the host galaxies of those qsos with higher extinctions have higher star formation rates .",
    "in contrast , studies by @xcite show that in quasar spectra there is very little  emission beyond that expected from the agn itself , indicating a supressed star formation efficiency in quasar host galaxies .",
    "unlike the controversy in type i qsos , the picture is a little clearer for seyfert 2s and type ii qsos .",
    "@xcite found that /  and /  ratios are lower in those seyfert 2 galaxies with significant star formation , which indicates that star formation could contribute substantially or even dominate the  and  emission .",
    "consistently , @xcite found that type ii qsos exhibit significantly enhanced /  ratios relative to type i qsos .",
    "combined with their high  luminosities , the high /  ratio is best explained by a high level of star formation .",
    "however , the problem is far from settled .",
    "although the  emission in qso spectra could be a combination of two or many origins , we still have no idea of their proportions .",
    "in addition , qso hosts are rare among galaxies .",
    "narrow - line , low - luminosity agn and liners ( which may or may not be agn ) are much more abundant .",
    "the dominant origin of  emission among these galaxies is still unknown .",
    "a variety of approaches can help to distinguish emission lines having different origins .",
    "one commonly used method , which is relatively reliable , is emission - line diagnostics ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ") , as also used by many authors mentioned above in qso studies .",
    "this method is effective in distinguishing the two major origins of emission : star formation versus agn .",
    "we will focus on using this method to investigate the origin of  emission in red galaxies in this paper .",
    "the large sdss redshift survey provides a perfect sample for such a study .",
    "its wide wavelength coverage covers many emission lines from  to , from which many line ratio diagnostics can be created . at the same time",
    ", moderate resolution still allows reasonable line profile fitting to be conducted , giving good control of errors in the line strength measurement .",
    "finally , its unprecedented huge sample size produces reliable statistics .",
    "previous studies of line ratio diagnostics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) used much smaller datasets with less uniform sampling .    in this paper , we present the discovery of a bimodality in /  ratio among galaxies .",
    "one mode is largely associated with star - forming galaxies .",
    "galaxies in the other mode generally have line ratios similar to liners , with  emission produced by a mechanism not associated with ordinary star formation .",
    "narrow - line seyferts and transition objects mostly fall in between the two dominant populations , consistent with the picture that both star formation and agn ( or some other source ) might contribute substantially to the emission in these objects .",
    "the /  bimodality we find also has important implications for post - starburst studies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the data used .",

    "the redshift ranges of these samples are chosen for several reasons .",
    "first , selecting very nearby galaxies is unfavorable because sloan spectra are taken with a 3 \" fiber which only covers a small fraction of each galaxy at low redshifts .",
    "secondly , objects at redshifts greater than @xmath16 are disfavored because blue galaxies drop out the @xmath15-band selected sample quickly with increasing @xmath17 .",

    "see appendix [ sec : contsub ] and [ sec : line ] .",
    "before diving into line comparisons , we recall that the color distribution of galaxies is highly bimodal , as have been shown repeatedly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : cmd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for all sdss galaxies within @xmath14 .",
    "we use this sample rather than the volume - limited sample simply to display a wider range in galaxy luminosity .    in color - magnitude space ,",
    "galaxies fall mainly into two categories .",
    "one category is the tight sequence between color and magnitude at the red end ( larger value of @xmath20 ) , commonly called the `` red sequence '' ; the other is the swath of points at bluer colors , which is sometimes referred to as the `` blue cloud '' .",
    "empirically , blue galaxies mostly have disk - dominated morphologies and are actively forming stars ; while red galaxies mostly have bulge - dominated morphologies and are relatively quiescient in terms of star formation .",
    "although the bimodality is obvious , it is impossible to entirely separate the two populations by color .",
    "one possibility is that color provides a poor measurement of some more fundamental property that cleanly distinguishes galaxies into two distinct populations .",
    "alternatively , the absence of a clean separation in color may simply reflect the smooth evolution of one population into the other .",
    "it is also likely that both possibilities are involved . for",
    "now , we use conservative color cuts to define the samples of red and blue galaxies , as shown with the two solid lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : cmd ] and desribed by the following inequalities .",
    "we leave a gap in color between the two samples to reduce the importance of color errors and galaxies with ambiguous status .",
    "we define these color cuts by : @xmath21      in this paper , we will use both equivalent width ( ew ) and flux / luminosity measurements of emission lines . for line intensity ratios and sfr measurements ,",
    "the use of flux is necessary , but fluxes are much more sensitive to dust extinction than equivalent widths .",
    "furthermore , ew will not be affected by imperfect flux calibration . on the other hand , to interpret the ew ratio between two lines , the continuum shape ( i.e. , the color of the galaxy ) needs to be taken into account .",
    "in addition , line luminosity and ew describe different sorts of physical quantities : line luminosity describes the total amount of emission , while ew reflects the strength of emission compared to the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "we will primarily employ ew in this paper because it is not subject to variations in galaxy size ( in contrast , line luminosity tends to scale with the total luminosity of a galaxy ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the correlations in ew are often tighter than those in luminosity , for all these reasons .",
    "figure [ fig : o2haew ] compares [ oii ] ew with h@xmath22 ew for galaxies in the volume - limited sample ( @xmath12 , @xmath23 ) which have both  and  positively detected .",
    "clearly , there are two -  sequences .",
    "one has a shallow slope and extends to very high  ew .",
    "the other sequence has a rather steep slope and very high concentration of points at low  ew , with  ew spanning a wide range .",
    "the bimodality in the -  diagram becomes even more obvious if plotted on a logarithmic scale , as shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : o2haew ] . here",
    "the shading reflects the density of points in units of number per square dex .",
    "the  ew distribution can be well fit by two log - normal distributions , one centered around 1  and the other centered around 14 .",
    "in linear space , the high - ew population spans a wide range of ews , but it becomes much more concentrated in log space .",
    "the bottom two panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2haew ] show  ew vs.  ew for the red galaxies and blue galaxies separately .",
    "the clear difference between the two populations shows immediately that most red galaxies reside on the steep - slope sequence , while most blue galaxies are on the shallow - slope sequence .",
    "clearly , the bimodality in /  ratio echoes the color bimodality .",
    "since most blue galaxies are actively forming stars , this is telling us that the shallow - slope sequence must have an /  ratio consistent with that produced in hii regions photoionized by o and b stars in star - forming galaxies .",
    "what mechanism gives rise to the different ratio seen in red galaxies ?    before addressing this question , we detour briefly to consider another issue .",
    "since we are thus far using equivalent width instead of line luminosity , one might imagine that the bimodality has little to do with emission strength ; rather , differences in eqivalent - width ratio might reflect only the different continuum ratios between stellar continua near  and  in red galaxies versus that of blue galaxies . since red galaxies have higher continuum ratios of @xmath24}})$ ] , they will have a higher value of @xmath25}})/\\mbox{ew}({\\mbox{h$\\alpha$}})$ ] for the same emission line luminosity ratio .",
    "this possibility can be checked by comparing l ( ) to l ( ) directly .    as shown by @xcite , however , such a plot of luminosity versus luminosity can be quite misleading because of the size effect : for a given class of galaxies , we expect both l ( ) and l ( ) to each have a significant correlation with the stellar mass of the galaxies , especially at the low - mass end , which would veil the true relationship between  and .",
    "this hidden variable can be easily removed by using specific line luminosity ; here we divide the line luminosity by the sloan @xmath26 band luminosity , which is a coarse proxy for the stellar mass .",
    "this effectively creates an ew , but one that does not include the continuum color variation between red and blue galaxies . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2haflux](a ) , the same separation between the two sequences persists in a plot of l()/l(@xmath26 ) vs. l()/l(@xmath26 ) , but with a smaller opening angle between them .",
    "the wider opening angle in the equivalent width plot indeed reflects the different continuum ratios between blue and red galaxies , but this is not the whole origin of the bimodality . in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : o2haflux ] , we plot l()/l(@xmath26 ) vs. l()/l(@xmath26 ) in logarithmic scale , analogous to the upper right panel in fig .",

    "we omit the plots for subsamples separated in color , due to their close resemblance to the bottom panels of fig .",

    "can the difference between line ratios for blue and red galaxies in /  ratio arise from reddening or metallicity dependences for star - forming regions ?",

    "<S> we investigate the emission - line properties of galaxies with red rest - frame colors ( compared to the @xmath0 color bimodality ) using spectra from data release 4 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> emission lines are detected in more than half of the red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the relationship between two emission lines commonly used as star formation rate indicators :  and . since  is the principal proxy for  at @xmath1 , the correlation between them is critical for comparison between low - z and high - z galaxy surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong bimodality in /  ratio in the sdss sample , which closely corresponds to the bimodality in rest - frame color . based on standard line ratio diagnostics , </S>",
    "<S> most ( nearly all of the ) line - emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of active galactic nuclei ( agn )  most commonly `` low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions '' ( liners ) , a small fraction of `` transition objects '' ( tos ) and , more rarely , seyferts . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath2 of red galaxies have line ratios resembling star - forming galaxies . a straight line in the -  ew diagram separates liner - like galaxies from other categories , provides an effective classification tool complementary to standard line ratio diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines and those galaxies with liner - like line ratios combine to form a single , tight red sequence in color - magnitude - concentration space . </S>",
    "<S> other than modest differences in the luminosity range they span , these two classes are only distinguished from each other by line strength . we also find that  equivalent widths in liner- and agn - like galaxies can be as large as that in star - forming galaxies . thus , unless objects with agn / liner - like line ratios are excluded ,  emission can not be used directly as a proxy for star formation rate ; this is a particular issue for red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> lack of  emission is generally used to indicate lack of star formation when post - starburst galaxies are selected at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply , however , that these samples have been cut on agn properties as well as star formation , and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets of post - starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , post - starburst galaxies identifed in sdss by requiring minimal  equivalent width generally exhibit weak but nonzero line emission with ratios typical of agns ; few of them show residual star formation . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that most post - starburst galaxies may harbor agns / liners . </S>"
