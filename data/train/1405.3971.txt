    "if we can guess the mechanism of the generation of ( pseudo-)random numbers used by a casino , then we can efficiently cheat in gambling@xcite . however , most of the so - called random number generators has a deterministic algorithm inside .",
    "it is very difficult to develop a reliable pseudo - random number generation ( prng ) method .",
    "although there are tests@xcite that allow to check whether a sequence of numbers conforms to a particular probability distribution , we can never be sure its security without the knowledge how the sequence was generated .",
    "one of the measures of randomness is so - called min - entropy@xcite . in particular , in the context of authentication , min - entropy is the probability of guessing the easiest key in a given distribution of keys@xcite .",
    "if we know the pseudo - random generating algorithm and the initial seed ( or some sequence of generated numbers ) , then the randomness of such a source is equal to zero .",
    "all classical prngs have this drawback .    on the other hand",
    ", quantum physics confuses philosophers with randomness on its deepest level .",
    "this randomness is unavoidable . we know",
    "that if certain observables ( _ bell operators _ , which are linear functions of observed probabilities occurring in the experiment ) attain certain thresholds , then the process must be intrinsically random , or we would have to abandon some ideas that are fundamental to all physical theories .",
    "thus , values of these observables guarantee that the results of performed measurements are indeed random , no matter how does the measuring apparatus work .",
    "this way the idea of the quantum randomness certification emerged@xcite .",
    "if we want to be sure that the device we are using does really produce random numbers , we perform _ bell experiment _ , which is a kind of self testing .",
    "such an experiment involves at least two separated parties that perform subsequent measurements with different settings without any communication between them .",
    "after series of such measurements , the collected data is used to estimate the joint probabilities of the outcomes conditioned on the settings used .",
    "the most prominent example of bell operator is so - called clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh)@xcite .    because such self testing works independently of the internal workings of the device used ( in particular ,",
    "the exact form of the performed measurements is not important ) , if the bell inequality attains some value , we are sure that the generated results are indeed random , even if the device has been construed by a malevolent party . the amount of the obtained secure randomness is precisely quantified by means of min - entropy@xcite .",
    "this approach , in which we do not trust the vendor of our devices and draw conclusions only from the observed results , is called _ _ device - independent__@xcite , referred further as _",
    "di_.    still , bell experiments are very difficult to do .",
    "they require a high degree of precision and extremely high detection efficiencies . so far loophole - free bell experiment has not been successfully performed .",
    "but when we allow to send a state from one part of the device to another , then we do not have any non - locality , which is crucial for that way of certification .",
    "it was shown that , if we can bound the dimension of the communicated system , we still may use this _ prepare and measure scheme _ to certify the randomness@xcite . since we have to know something about the construction of the device ,",
    "this approach is called _ _ semi - device - independent__@xcite ( denoted hereafter _ sdi _ ) .",
    "this offers a good compromise between security and experimental feasibility .",
    "currently all commercial quantum random generators are based on the prepare and measure scheme , _",
    "e.g. _ the _ i d  quantique_s@xcite device _ quantis _ , or the _ qstream _ by _ _",
    "quintessence labs__@xcite .",
    "these devices do not perform any self testing , so we are forced to trust their vendors . for this reason ,",
    "methods for certifying randomness in the prepare and measure scheme with the semi - device - independent approach should be investigated . in this framework analogs of bell inequalities , called _ dimension witnesses _ @xcite , are used .",
    "before we proceed we should stress that what we call random number generation is in fact randomness _ expansion _ , the process that starts with some amount of initial randomness and uses it to obtain more of it .",
    "the presented self testing procedure of the device also requires some amount of randomness ( in order to choose the measurement settings in rounds of testing experiments ) .",
    "strictly speaking , all quantum random number generators that use bell inequalities or dimension witnesses to certify the randomness are randomness expanders .",
    "after generation of a string of bits with a certain amount of min - entropy , it is possible to _ extract _ its randomness what means using a certain algorithm to produce a shorter string with a larger min - entropy per bit@xcite .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite we have investigated the relation between random number expansion protocols based on correlations occurring in the scenario where two parties share an entangled state , and on protocols relying on the prepare and measure scheme . in this paper",
    "we develop these ideas .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the section [ sec : motivation ] we present",
    "scenario in which we are working .",
    "next , in sections [ sec : bi ] and [ sec : dw ] , we give basic information about bell inequalities and dimension witnesses .",
    "then , in the section [ sec : bitodw ] , we recapitulate a heuristic method of obtaining a dimension witness from a bell inequality .",
    "this method was introduced in @xcite . in sections",
    "[ sec : dwtobi ] and [ sec : binarydw ] we precisely state the conditions when the randomness certified by the violation of a bell inequality lower - bounds the randomness certified by a certain value of dimension witness in the semi - device - independent scenario . in the section [ sec : symdw ] we investigate the properties of a certain class of dimension witnesses and introduce a procedure of dimension witness reduction , which can be used to obtain from an existing witness a new one with higher amount of certifiable randomness . in the section",
    "[ sec : explicitexamples ] we give examples of application of the presented methods .",
    "the aims of this paper are as follows .",
    "we clarify the methods from our previous paper @xcite and give a tighter lower bound on randomness . using these methods we obtain better dimension witnesses , in particular the one based on the braunstein - caves bell inequality @xcite .",
    "we also extend the applicability of the methods from @xcite to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "suppose we are a developer of a random number generating device .",
    "since consumers do not trust us , we are interested in finding a way of certification for our device .",
    "common method for the certification of quantum random number generators that are based on measurements on entangled particles is to estimate the value of a certain bell inequality that is attained in this device .",
    "still , it is too difficult to observe a loophole - free violation of bell inequality .",
    "thus we prefer prepare and measure protocols .    both for prepare and measure protocols in the semi - device - independent approach , and for correlation protocols in the device - independent scheme",
    ", we would like to define a value that measures how reliable is its particular realization . as this value",
    "we take the expectation value of the relevant dimension witness or bell inequality , respectively , attained in the relevant protocol .",
    "this value is called a _ security parameter_.    it is possible to consider several relations .",
    "one may ask whether , having a protocol of one type , we can relate it to some protocol of another type , in such a way that for the same value of their security parameters the min - entropy certified in one of them , is upper or lower bounded by min - entropy certified by the other one . one may start with a protocol based on a bell inequality and construct out of it a prepare and measure protocol certifying a reasonable amount of min - entropy .",
    "this is useful since there are many randomness expansion protocols based on bell inequalities@xcite and it is easy to obtain new ones @xcite .",
    "another situation is when we begin with some sdi protocol and want to lower bound the certified randomness using efficient numerical methods from @xcite , that works in the device - independent approach",
    ". we present a way to obtain a new bell inequality with the property that the di protocol using it certifies at most as much randomness as the sdi protocol .",
    "as mentioned above , sdi protocols are much easier to implement than the protocols based on entanglement .",
    "for this reason it is useful to have a method that allows to develop devices of the first kind with the help of the well established knowledge about the devices of the second type .",
