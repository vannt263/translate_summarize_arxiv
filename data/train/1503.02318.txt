    "developing group - level image features that can reason about such higher - order phenomenon has not been well studied in the vision community .",
    "visual search or saliency has been studied to identify which images or image regions pop out .",
    "but models of change in relative orderings of the same set of images based on presence of other images have not been explored .",
    "such models may allow us to select the ideal set of images to surround an image by to increase its chances of going viral .",
    "having examined the effect of images in the spatial vicinity on image virality , we now study the effects of temporal aspects .",
    "in particular , we show users the same pairs of images used in the relative virality experiment in section  [ sec : relative_virality ] at 4 different resolutions one after the other : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( original ) .",
    "we choose blurring to simulate first impression judgements at thumbnail sizes when images are ` previewed ' . at each stage",
    ", we asked them which image they think is more likely to be viral .",
    "virality prediction performance was @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "virality prediction is reduced to chance even in @xmath74 images , where humans have been shown to recognize semantic content in images very reliably  @xcite .",
    "subjects reported being surprised for 65% of the images .",
    "we found a -0.04 correlation between true virality and surprise , and a -0.07 correlation between predicted virality and surpise .",
    "perhaps people are bad at estimating whether they were truly surprised or not , and asking them may not be effective ; or surprise truly is not correlated with virality .      as a first experiment to evaluate the role of the title of the image",
    ", we show workers pairs of images and ask them which one they think is more likely to be viral .",
    "we then reveal the title of the image , and ask them the same question again .",
    "we found that access to the title barely improved virality prediction ( @xmath79 vs. @xmath80 ) .",
    "this suggests that perhaps the title does not sway subjects after they have already judged the content .",
    "our second experiment had the reverse set up .",
    "we first showed workers the title alone , and asked them which title is more likely to make an image be viral .",
    "we then showed them the image ( along with the title ) , and asked them the same question .",
    "workers prediction of relative virality was worse than chance using the title alone ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "interestingly , having been primed by the title , even with access to the image performance did not improve significantly above chance ( @xmath82 ) and is significantly lower than their performance when viewing an image without being primed by the title ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "this suggests that image content seems to be the prime signal in human perception of image virality .",
    "however , note that these experiments do not analyze the role of text that may be embedded in the image ( memes ! ) .",
    "we studied viral images from a computer vision perspective .",
    "we introduced three new image datasets from reddit , the main engine of viral content around the world .",
    "we defined a virality score using reddit metadata .",
    "we found that virality can be predicted more accurately as a relative concept .",
    "while humans can predict relative virality from image content , machines are unable to do so using low - level features .",
    "high - level image understanding is key .",
    "we identified five key visual attributes that correlate with virality : animal , synthetically generated , ( not ) beautiful , explicit and sexual .",
    "we predict these relative attributes using deep image features .",
    "using these deep relative attribute predictions as features , machines ( svm ) can predict virality with an accuracy of @xmath0 ( higher than human performance : @xmath1 ) . finally , we study how human prediction of image virality varies with different `` contexts ''  intrinsic , spatial ( vicinity ) , temporal and textual .",
    "this work is a first step in understanding the complex but important phenomenon of image virality .",
    "we have demonstrated the need for advanced image understanding to predict virality , as well as the qualitative difference between our datasets and typical vision datasets .",
    "this opens up new opportunities for the vision community .",
    "our datasets and annotations will be made publicly available .",
    "this work was supported in part by aro yip 65359nsyip to d.p . and nsf iis-1115719 .",
    "we would also like to thank stanislaw antol , michael cogswell , harsh agrawal , and arjun chandrasekaran for their feedback and support .",
    "machine performance using different metrics for virality are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : machine_score_prediction_app ] . we see that current vision models have a hard time differentiating between these viral and non - viral images , under any criteria .",
    "the svm was trained with both linear and non linear kernels on 5 random splits of our dataset of @xmath4310k images , using 250 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , 4000 images for training , and 1039 images of each class for testing .",
    "recall that we define our virality score for image @xmath6 across all resubmissions @xmath12 as    @xmath15    where @xmath3 is the number of times image @xmath6 was resubmitted , and @xmath16 is the average number of times any image has been resubmitted .",
    "@xmath11 is a normalized score based on the metric of  @xcite .",
    "the other metrics we experimented with included maximum upvotes @xmath83(fig .",
    "[ fig : up_metric_app ] ) across submissions and number of resubmissions @xmath3(fig .",
    "[ fig : sh_metric_app ] ) .",
    "the confusion matrices in figure  [ fig : subreddit_exem_app ] depict how a human and computer perform at identifying categories / topics ( subreddits ) in viral images ( section  [ subreddit_disc ] ) .",
    "a computer achieves @xmath33 accuracy using svm + decaf6 after training on 60 images , while a human achieves @xmath32 on the same test images ( chance is @xmath84 ) . recall that this group of amt workers had to undergo training to learn how to identify the categories just like the computer , with the same exemplars ( 55 on training + 5 for validating that the workers paid attention during training ) .",
    "both humans and machines tend to confuse gaming images with funny ones .",
    "they are also both remarkabely good at identifying the aww category .",
    "while for a human it might be trivial , we suspect that it is also easy for the machine , since texture ( animal fur , feathers , skin ) plays an important role that decaf6 is encoding .",
    "atheism on the other hand is very simple for a human , but complex for a machine .",
    "we are inclined to believe that since identifying whether an image contains religious content or not involves high - level semantics and often text , the task of detecting atheism is challenging for a machine .",
    "the machine as a result tends to confuse it with funny or gaming , as some of these images also contain text .",
    "examples from all 5 categories are shown in fig  [ fig : montage_family_app ] .",
    "[ fig : reddit_mini_app ]    potential applications for subreddit classification include a recomendation system for a human to know to what category to submit his image for marketing / personal purposes .",
    "automatically identifying a subreddit ( or topic ) of the image can also provide context when generating image descriptions  @xcite .",
    "viral images are very different from standard images analyzed in different computer vision datasets . in figure",
    "[ fig : sun_mini_app ] , we see how the sun dataset images favors open spaces in outdoor and indoor environments",
    ". images from flickr ( figure  [ fig : flickr_mini_app ] ) have more variation than sun images , yet the images still follow many traditional and photographic rules : rule of the third , principal subject(s ) in picture , all co - occurring objects are in context , and they are colorful just like the sun dataset . recall that flickr has become an online platform for photographers and amateurs to share their most beautiful pictures , an attribute that correlates _ inversely _ with virality .",
    "viral images , on the other hand , seem non - sensical , chaotic , and very unpredictable .",
    "they do not follow photographic rules .",
    "they can have cartoons , text , and ( non)photorealistic content embedded separately or together , yet they still express an idea that is easily understandable for humans .",
    "we hope that the vision community will study automatic image understanding in these kinds of images ( figure  [ fig : reddit_mini_app ] ) ."
