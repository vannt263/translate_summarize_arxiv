    "recently , considerable interest has been focused on the interaction of atoms with metal and dielectric plates ( walls ) at separation distances @xmath0 from about 100 nm to a few micrometers where the retardation effects of the electromagnetic field play an important role .",
    "the relativistic description of the fluctuating interaction of atoms with an ideal metal plate at zero temperature was pioneered by casimir and polder @xcite who obtained the interaction energy in the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the static atomic polarizability , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the planck constant and the velocity of light .",
    "lifshitz @xcite developed the general theory of dispersion forces between two dielectric semispaces at a temperature @xmath5 in thermal equilibrium with plane parallel boundary surfaces separated by a gap @xmath0 of arbitrary width much larger than interatomic distances .",
    "this theory describes material properties with a dielectric permittivity that depends only on frequency .",
    "it includes both nonrelativistic ( when @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the characteristic absorption wavelength of the semispace material ) and relativistic ( when @xmath8 ) limiting cases .",
    "if the material of one of the plates is rarefied , the general formula for the energy of the atom - wall interaction is obtained .",
    "for an ideal metal plate at @xmath9 it leads to the casimir - polder result . in the high temperature ( large separation )",
    "limit the interaction free energy of an atom with an ideal metal plate is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant . for a dielectric plate with the static dielectric permittivity @xmath12",
    ", the free energy acquires an additional factor @xmath13 which goes to unity when @xmath14 .    in the last few years",
    "the casimir - polder and lifshitz formulas have been used for the interpretation of many experiments on quantum reflection and bose - einstein condensation of ultra - cold atoms near a variety of surfaces ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the lifshitz theory was also extensively applied for the interpretation of measurements of the casimir force between two macrobodies made of metals and semiconductors ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all these experiments have attracted widespread attention from diverse fields ranging from condensed matter physics and nanotechnology to atomic physics , elementary particle physics , gravitation and cosmology .",
    "however , the application of the lifshitz theory to the real material bodies used in experiments has resulted in a puzzle .",
    "it was found that for metallic test bodies with perfect crystal lattices the calculational results are in contradiction with thermodynamics @xcite and experimental data @xcite if the relaxation processes of conduction electrons are included into the model of the dielectric response used in the lifshitz theory . for semiconductor and dielectric materials",
    "whose conductivity goes to zero with vanishing temperature , the calculational results using the lifshitz theory were also shown to be in contradiction with thermodynamics @xcite and experiment @xcite when the dc conductivity of a dielectric or a high - resistivity semiconductor plate is included .",
    "an interesting attempt to find the physical explanation for some of these puzzling results is undertaken in @xcite .",
    "it takes into account the debye screening of the electrostatic field by free charge carriers in the conductor leading to a modified reflection coefficient for the transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode at zero frequency in comparison to the lifshitz theory ( the above mentioned puzzles arise only in the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula ) .",
    "the reflection coefficient for the transverse electric ( te ) mode at zero frequency for dielectric materials is equal to zero regardless of the dc conductivity .    in this paper",
    "we find the low - temperature behavior of the entropy of the casimir - polder atom - plate interaction both in the framework of the commonly accepted lifshitz theory and its generalization taking into account the screening effects .",
    "we demonstrate that if the dc conductivity of dielectrics is disregarded the casimir - polder entropy goes to zero when the temperature vanishes , i.e. , the nernst heat theorem is satisfied .",
    "thus , we show that in this case the standard lifshitz theory of atom - wall interaction is in agreement with thermodynamics .",
    "if the dc conductivity is included , the standard lifshitz theory violates nernst s theorem .",
    "the generalization @xcite is in agreement with nernst s theorem for dielectrics whose charge carrier density vanishes when @xmath5 goes to zero . however , for dielectrics whose charge carrier density is temperature - independent ( for such materials conductivity goes to zero with @xmath5 not due to the vanishing @xmath15 but due to the vanishing mobility of the charge carriers ) the generalization of the lifshitz theory taking into account the screening effects is shown to violate the nernst theorem .",
    "finally we demonstrate that the suggested generalization of tm reflection coefficient at zero frequency is inconsistent with the measurement data of the difference casimir force between a metal sphere and a semiconductor plate @xcite .",
    "we start with the standard lifshitz formula for the free energy of an atom - plate interaction @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the matsubara frequencies , @xmath19 , prime indicates that the @xmath20 term has to be multiplied by 1/2 , and @xmath21\\right\\}. \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] the reflection coefficients are defined through the frequency - dependent permittivity @xmath22 @xmath23 the atomic dynamic polarizability can be represented with sufficient precision using the single - oscillator model @xcite @xmath24 with a dimensionless constant @xmath25 .    using the abel - plana formula @xcite , the free energy ( [ eq1 ] ) can be equivalently represented in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the casimir - polder energy at zero temperature , @xmath28 and",
    "the effective temperature is defined from @xmath29 .      as a result , from ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath44 then from ( [ eq5 ] ) the casimir - polder free energy is given by @xmath45 and the casimir - polder entropy by @xmath46 as can be seen from ( [ eq10 ] ) , the entropy goes to zero when @xmath5 vanishes in accordance with the nernst heat theorem .",
    "thus , the lifshitz theory of the atom - plate interaction is thermodynamically consistent if the dc conductivity of dielectric plate is disregarded .    in electrodynamics the inclusion of the dc conductivity",
    "is equivalent to the replacement of @xmath47 with @xmath48 in the lifshitz theory this leads to only negligible additions to all the terms at @xmath49 with @xmath50 in the free energy and entropy .",
    "these additions exponentially decay to zero with vanishing temperature @xcite .",
    "however , the term with @xmath20 is modified because according to ( [ eq3 ] ) @xmath51 is replaced with @xmath52 . as a result , with",
    "dc conductivity included the free energy of the atom - plate interaction at low temperature is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is defined in ( [ eq9 ] ) . from ( [ eq12 ] ) one immediately arrives at the violation of the nernst heat theorem @xmath55",
    "now we apply the above thermodynamic test to the generalization of the lifshitz theory taking into account the screening effects .",
    "as is well known , such effects arise when a static electric field penetrates into a medium with a nonzero concentration of charge carriers . in this case , the reflection coefficient @xmath56 , as given in ( [ eq3 ] ) ( the standard lifshitz theory ) , is modified to @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath15 is the total density of free charge carriers , while all the coefficients @xmath59 with @xmath50 and also @xmath60 remain unchanged @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath61 is connected with the so - called _ debye radius _ , @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath63 , ( [ eq14 ] ) leads to the same result as ( [ eq3 ] ) . for @xmath64 , at fixed @xmath65 , @xmath66 , as in the case of the standard lifshitz theory when the dc conductivity is included .",
    "the existence of dielectric materials for which @xmath15 does not go to zero but @xmath79 does go to zero when @xmath5 vanishes demonstrates that the reflection coefficient ( [ eq14 ] ) is ambiguous .",
    "in reality , for such materials @xmath75 when @xmath5 and @xmath79 simultaneously vanish . this is because @xmath74 when @xmath76 in disagreement with physical intuition that there should be no screening at zero mobility . in the conclusions ,",
    "this ambiguity is linked to the break in continuity of the more general reflection coefficients at the point @xmath81 , @xmath9 .",
    "the reflection coefficient ( [ eq14 ] ) can be formally obtained from the standard lifshitz theory with dissimilar permittivities @xmath82 and @xmath83 commonly used for the description of uniaxial crystals @xcite . in this case the transverse magnetic reflection coefficient at zero frequency is given by @xmath84 then ( [ eq14 ] ) follows from ( [ eq17a ] ) if one puts @xmath85 however , an important difference of ( [ eq17a ] ) , ( [ eq17b ] ) from permittivities used in the case of uniaxial crystals is that ( [ eq17b ] ) depends on the wave vector .",
    "this is in fact an extension of the lifshitz theory with the inclusion of spatial dispersion .",
    "such an inclusion is controversial and has been debated for long in the literature ( see the negative conclusions regarding such an inclusion in @xcite and the recent discussion @xcite ) .    the question of whether there is a possibility to compare the theoretical predictions of @xcite with experimental data should be considered .",
    "this could be done with regard to the experiments on measuring the casimir - polder interaction between an atom and a sio@xmath40 plate @xcite and the casimir interaction between an au - coated sphere and a si plate @xcite .",
    "in both cases the te reflection coefficient at zero frequency does not contribute to the theoretical result .",
    "the experiment @xcite was successfully used @xcite to demonstrate that the inclusion of the dc conductivity of sio@xmath40 in the standard lifshitz theory is inconsistent with the data .",
    "this is in support of our result in section 2 that such an inclusion leads to a contradiction between the lifshitz theory and thermodynamics . in this connection",
    "the phenomenological prescription was formulated @xcite that for dielectric materials the conductivity arising at nonzero temperature should be disregarded in the calculation of the casimir force using the lifshitz theory .",
    "recently one more experiment has been performed on measuring the difference of the casimir forces between an au sphere and b doped p - type si plate illuminated with laser pulses @xcite . in the absence of laser pulse",
    "the concentration of charge carriers in a si plate was @xmath86 and in the presence of pulse @xmath87 or @xmath88 for two different absorbed powers @xmath89mw and @xmath90mw .",
    "the directly measured quantity was @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the casimir forces in the presence and in the absence of laser light on the plate , respectively .",
    "the experimental data were compared with the lifshitz theory with neglected or included dc conductivity of the high - resistivity si in the dark phase . in the latter case",
    "the theoretical model was found to be inconsistent with the data . here , we compare the measurement data of this experiment ( shown as crosses in fig",
    ".  1 with experimental errors in force measurement determined at 70% confidence level ) with computations on the basis of the standard lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity neglected in the dark phase ( solid lines ) and on the basis of its generalization taking into account the screening effects @xcite ( dashed lines ) .",
    "figs .  1(a ) and 1(b )",
    "are related to the absorbed powers @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the experiment was performed in a high vacuum at @xmath95k ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the solid lines were computed using the standard lifshitz formula for the casimir force with si in the dark phase described as dielectric , i.e. , by @xmath96 with @xmath97 . in the presence of light the dielectric permittivity",
    "@xmath98 has been used with the values of plasma frequencies for electrons and holes determined in @xcite for different absorbed powers .",
    "almost the same results are obtained if the drude description of charge carriers is used in the presence of light @xmath99}+ \\frac{\\omega_{p(p)}^2}{\\xi_l[\\xi_l+\\gamma^{(p ) } ] } \\label{eq19}\\ ] ] ( see @xcite for the values of all parameters at different absorbed powers ) .",
    "the dashed lines are obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) for the zero frequency tm reflection coefficient with different concentrations of charge carriers @xmath100 in the dark phase and @xmath101 or @xmath102 in the presence of light . at all nonzero matsubara frequencies , in accordance with @xcite ,",
    "the standard terms of the lifshitz formula were used .",
    "the gold coated sphere was described by the commonly used dielectric permittivity along the imaginary frequency axis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have verified that for au the use of expression ( [ eq14 ] ) instead of the standard zero - frequency term , as given by the lifshitz theory , leads to numerically the same results up to five significant figures .        as is seen in figure  1(a ,",
    "b ) , the experimental data are consistent with the theoretical results computed on the basis of the standard lifshitz theory with the dc conductivity of dielectric si neglected in the dark phase ( the solid lines ) .",
    "the theoretical results computed on the basis of the generalized lifshitz theory @xcite with the modified tm reflection coefficient at zero frequency are excluded by data at a 70% confidence level .",
    "the same conclusion follows from the third data set obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath103mw absorbed power .",
    "to conclude , we have found the low - temperature behavior of the casimir - polder free energy and entropy in atom - plate configuration on the basis of the lifshitz theory . for a dielectric plate with",
    "the dc conductivity of the plate material neglected , the lifshitz theory was shown to be thermodynamically consistent . with the dc conductivity included , the standard lifshitz theory of atom - plate interaction violates the nernst heat theorem .",
    "the thermodynamic test was also applied to the recent generalization of the lifshitz theory taking into account the screening effects .",
    "the proposed generalization is shown to be in violation of the nernst theorem for a wide range of dielectric materials including doped semiconductors with doping concentration below critical and ionic conductors .",
    "this generalization is also inconsistent with the measurements of the difference casimir force between a metal sphere and si plate illuminated with laser pulses .",
    "recently , the generalization of the lifshitz theory @xcite was extended using the boltzmann transport equation @xcite .",
    "this approach , in addition to the standard drift current @xmath104 , takes into account the diffusion current @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the diffusion constant . in the quasi - static limit @xmath107 the reflection coefficient ( [ eq14 ] )",
    "was reproduced . however ,",
    "if one takes the limit @xmath76 first , keeping @xmath108 , the standard fresnel reflection coefficients ( [ eq3 ] ) on the dielectric surface with no screening are obtained .",
    "this property is preserved in the subsequent limiting transition @xmath107 .",
    "the calculation of the difference casimir force in the experimental configuration @xcite using the reflection coefficients @xcite defined at all matsubara frequencies leads to precisely the same results , as shown by the dashed lines in figure  1(a , b ) .",
    "thus , the theoretical approach @xcite is also inconsistent with experiment .",
    "this is in line with the above phenomenological prescription stating that conductivity arising in dielectric materials at @xmath65 should be disregarded .",
    "one may attempt to explain the physical reason of why the lifshitz theory does not allow the inclusion of real conductivity processes as follows .",
    "lifshitz derived his famous formulas under the condition of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this means that not only @xmath109 , but also all irreversible processes connected with the dissipation of energy into heat have already been terminated @xcite .",
    "the drude - like dielectric function ( [ eq11 ] ) is derived from the maxwell equations with a real drift current of conduction electrons @xmath110 initiated by the external electric field @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the drift current is an irreversible process which brings a system out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the characteristic of this irreversible process , the drude type of dielectric function , can be also derived within the kubo formalism @xcite using the correlation function of the electric field averaged over the thermodynamic state functions which are assumed to have the same values as they would have in an equilibrium situation .",
    "this allows a theoretical description of irreversible processes under the assumption that there is local equilibrium .",
    "the real current leads to joule s heating of the casimir plates ( ohmic losses ) @xcite . to preserve the temperature constant",
    ", one should admit that there exists an unidirectional flux of heat from the medium to the heat reservoir @xcite .",
    "such interactions between a system and a heat reservoir are prohibited by the definition of thermal equilibrium .",
    "although the screening and diffusion effects really occur in an external electric field , they are also related to physical situations out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the reason is that the diffusion current is determined by a nonzero gradient of charge carrier density , whereas for homogeneous systems in thermal equilibrium the charge carrier density must be homogeneous .",
    "our conclusion is that the standard lifshitz theory of both atom - wall and wall - wall interactions is in a very good agreement with both thermodynamics and all available experiments .",
    "violations of the nernst theorem and contradictions with the experimental data arise when the theory is applied to physical phenomena involving electric current , be it of drift or diffusion type .",
    "such an application seems to be in violation of thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory .",
