    "an immense number of recent experiments on high @xmath13 superconductors aims at a determination of the form of the bcs gap function in momentum space.@xcite josephson junction experiments,@xcite measurements of the london penetration depth,@xcite and of the cu nmr relaxation rate @xcite are consistent with a @xmath11-gap . particularly interesting",
    "are the arpes data which provide rather precise information about the detailed angular dependence of the amplitude of the gap function .",
    "the experiments on the bi2212 compound show that the order parameter is maximal along the @xmath14 direction @xcite and that its amplitude in the @xmath15 direction seems to attain a nonzero value at a new critical temperature below @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    the @xmath16 symmetry of the gap function is generally considered to be a sign of a pairing interaction of electronic origin , implying the absence of the standard phononic mechanism for superconductivity .",
    "the idea of a superconducting state induced by fluctuations of purely electronic origin in systems of electrons with coulomb repulsion is originally due to kohn and luttinger @xcite for the case of the three dimensional electron gas .",
    "similar effects exists in a two - dimensional electron gas , and generally they depend strongly on the form of the fermi surface .",
    "perturbative calculations of the four point vertex for a weakly filled band in the hubbard model show that the model is instable against @xmath9 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations on the same model , in the vicinity of metal - insulator transition , show that the attractive pairing interaction of @xmath11 symmetry is dominant,@xcite , in agreement with the earlier arguments that antiferromagnetic fluctuations are the mediator of pairing interactions @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for @xmath11 superconducting ordering has however not yet been found in quantum monte carlo studies .",
    "antiferromagnetic fluctuations become stronger and stronger as one approaches half - filling . for weakly interacting electrons ,",
    "these fluctuations are associated with the @xmath17-divergence of the electron ",
    "hole ( e - h ) loop diagram , caused by the nesting property of the fermi surface and the van hove singularities . on the other hand the bcs fluctuations , characterized by the electron - electron ( e - e ) loop , normally only linear in logarithms , crosses over to a @xmath17 form in the vicinity of half - filling .",
    "the perturbative treatment of an interacting system of electrons should thus be based on the summation of all iterations of these two types of loops .",
    "the renormalization group is one way to do this .",
    "applied to interactions between electrons placed at the van hove points it gives an antiferromagnetic instability at half - filling and superconductivity of @xmath11 symmetry if the deviation of the chemical potential @xmath18 from its value at half - filling becomes of the order of critical temperature of the antiferromagnetic state.@xcite the equivalent parquet approach has been used for half - filling and also finds the antiferromagnetic state.@xcite a direct calculation of the zero temperature free energy @xcite up to the second order in the bare interaction @xmath19 confirms that at half - filling the antiferromagnetic order is stable , but finds no finite superconducting order parameter at any filling .    in the present analysis",
    "we search to know whether the hubbard model with repulsive on - site interaction can lead to superconductivity , and if it does , to what form of the gap function .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the dependence of the results on the density of electrons .",
    "it is hoped that the results can help us to clarify the origins of the existence of a highly anisotropic bcs gap function in the cuprates .",
    "the renormalization group technique for fermionic systems in two and three dimensions has recently been developed , but with very drastic limitations .",
    "the wilsonian mode - elimination technique was applied by shankar @xcite only to systems with an either isotropic or open , perfectly nested fermi surface .",
    "weinberg @xcite has written the flow equations for a general case of an anisotropic fermi surface , but taking into account only the electron - electron channel of the flow . moreover , a common tendency is to do the renormalization group procedure only for a thin ring of degrees of freedom around the fermi surface and to linearize the spectrum in the radial direction , taking as a starting model the low - energy effective action .",
    "this makes it difficult or impossible to make statements about the phase diagram of lattice models like those relevant for the description of the cuprates , due to the absence of a proper description of high - energy degrees of freedom , the elimination of which may considerably affect the effective low  energy action .",
    "we formulate the renormalization group starting from the hubbard model , with the whole brillouin zone involved in renormalization .",
    "we do no tree level scaling before the energy shell @xmath20 of available states around the fermi surface contains no van hove singularity .",
    "once @xmath0 has become the smallest energy scale , performing a tree level analysis and deriving the renormalization group equations , we show that the effective coupling function contains some relevant contributions with the origins in the regime with higher @xmath0 , i.e. from the electronic degrees of freedom not included in the low energy effective action .",
    "we must add that our renormalization group , since perturbative in interaction , can provide uniquely the information whether the fermi liquid is a fixed point or not .",
    "if the coupling flows to strong coupling , we can say in which direction it flows , for example in the @xmath16type superconducting direction , but we can not say whether another fixed point with finite superconducting order parameter with @xmath16 symmetry exists or not . this kind of problem is well known e.g. from the renormalization group in quasi - one - dimensional compounds , where the most divergent flow in some direction is always associated with the corresponding long  range order ( lro ) because already infinitesimal interchain coupling suffices for its stabilization.@xcite similarly , the dimensionality reason for the non - existence of lro in two dimensions at finite temperature can be ignored as soon as small hopping in the third direction exists .",
    "this , however , does nt mean that lro and fermi liquid fixed points are the only possible , on this question the one - loop renormalization group simply can not give an answer .",
    "the problem is formulated in section 2 in terms of the effective action and the corresponding renormalization group flow equation for the coupling function . in section 3 , after calculation of the crossover energy to the purely electron - electron ( e - e ) part of the flow , we derive the renormalization group equation for the pairing function @xmath5 . in section 4 .",
    "we diagonalize the pairing @xmath5 for the case of a non - divergent electron - hole ( e - h ) channel and determine the most attractive eigenfunction and the resulting critical temperature as functions of the chemical potential @xmath18 . in section 5 we give our picture of the gap viewed by arpes experiments .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "the hubbard model for a two - dimensional system of electrons on a square lattice is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the momenta are within the first brillouin zone .",
    "for this model we introduce now the action in terms of fermion coherent states represented by grassmann variables@xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "we will write it in the form @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 constrains all four momenta to run within the energy shell @xmath29 around the fermi surface . the energy and momentum",
    "are conserved so that @xmath30 .",
    "note that the size of the cutoff is equal to the bandwidth , i.e. the whole brillouin zone is available for integration .",
    "thus , the @xmath31 functions have no meaning yet : they become important when the cutoff , reduced by the renormalization group , become lower than a tilt from the fermi level to the band boundary .",
    "note that for a non - half filled band the effective phase space is not particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the renormalization group transformation that we will use , known as the field theory approach , is defined as the mapping @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath1 depend on @xmath34 in a way so that the physical properties of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the same for energies lower than @xmath37 .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled if all one - particle irreducible vertices are invariant under reduction of the cutoff from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "the renormalization group can be thought of as a set of successive , infinitesimally small steps @xmath40 .",
    "this allows us to formalize the renormalization group requirement in a set of equations @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "up to second order in @xmath1 , it suffices to consider only @xmath43 and @xmath44 , because all higher vertices are of higher order in @xmath1 . the solutions of the equations @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath45 give us the renormalization group flow for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "conservation of spin allows us to write the interaction part of the action as a sum of the singlet @xmath48 and triplet @xmath49 parts : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the variables of annihilation of the singlet and triplet states @xmath53 @xmath54 the singlet state is symmetric and the triplet antisymmetric under exchange of the momenta of two particles .",
    "correspondingly , the coupling function @xmath55 can be taken to be symmetric and @xmath56 to be antisymmetric under the momentum exchange operation @xmath57 , defined as @xmath58 @xmath59 being a function of four energy ",
    "momenta which conserves energy and momentum . if @xmath59 possesses time - reversal symmetry @xmath60 which certainly is a property of the vertex , then it is equivalent whether @xmath57 exchanges @xmath61 and @xmath62 or @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "formally , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by @xmath68 on the other hand , the interaction can also be written as a sum of one term with equal @xmath69 and one with opposite @xmath70 spin quantum numbers , with corresponding coupling functions named @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . from two equal - spin electrons",
    "one can build only a triplet state , which make us conclude that @xmath73 while @xmath74 containing the singlet and the triplet interactions .",
    "another way to write the interaction is in terms of a charge and a spin part @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are @xmath78 the charge and spin coupling functions are @xmath79 in first order of perturbation theory , these functions determine the renormalization of the charge - charge and the spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "we proceed now with the derivation of renormalization group equations . for simplicity",
    ", we will ignore the renormalization flow of @xmath46 , which follows from conservation of @xmath43 , renormalizing the form of the fermi surface , the effective mass , etc .",
    "this approximation is justified in the case of the circular fermi surface @xcite . in the anisotropic case ,",
    "the diagrams for @xmath43 have a dependence on the direction of * k*. moreover , even a small renormalization of the fermi energy can give important changes of the form of the fermi surface if one is close to half  filling , because of van hove singularities .",
    "for filling not too close to one - half we can expect that the essential of the physics is given by just the renormalization of the coupling @xmath1 using the bare dispersion relation @xmath80 , which we will call @xmath46 from now on .",
    "the feynman diagrams for @xmath43 and @xmath81 are given in fig .",
    "the first loop in the expression for @xmath44 is of the electron - electron ( e - e ) and all others of the electron - hole ( e - h ) type . making use of the relations ( [ upar ] ) , ( [ uper ] ) , and ( [ as ] )",
    ", we get the expression for @xmath44 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath82 .",
    "if we write the integration measure of the loop diagrams in the form @xmath83 @xmath51 being the curves of constant energy @xmath84 , then @xmath85 corresponds to the integration of the two energy shells of width @xmath86 with @xmath87 the functionals @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath34 of the e - e and e - h loops and both are bilinear forms in @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "they read @xmath92 and @xmath93 with @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 the index @xmath98 symbolizes two energy shells at @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; @xmath101 stands for @xmath102 ; @xmath103 ; @xmath104 ; @xmath105 ; @xmath106 ; @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the momentum running along the path @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 are non - analytic functions of the momenta , given by @xmath112 their origin is in the derivatives over @xmath0 of the products like @xmath113 when @xmath114 .",
    "a particularity of the renormalization group approach treating e - e and e - h fluctuations in more than one dimension is the absence of self - similarity of the problem .",
    "in fact , there is an intrinsic energy scale which is a function of the band filling .",
    "it is associated with charge and spin fluctuations coming from the e - h term .",
    "we will proceed by estimating the characteristic energy scales which appear in @xmath115 and @xmath116 , when all four particles are at the fermi surface , with zero energy .",
    "if we are exactly at half - filling , it is known that in the limit @xmath117 both e - e and e - h loops scale like @xmath118 , which corresponds to the square - logarithmic divergence in both channels .",
    "this gives an explicit @xmath119 dependence in the @xmath120-functionals .",
    "let us suppose now that the filling is slightly lower than one - half , i.e. that @xmath121 is small and negative .",
    "we expect two regimes .",
    "one is for @xmath122 , where the flow is still unaffected by the small changes of the fermi surface due to nonzero @xmath121 and remains proportional to @xmath34 . in the second regime ,",
    "where @xmath123 , the e - e flow is just a constant ( i.e. only a @xmath124-divergence ) , while the e - h flow decays exponentially due to disappearance of nesting . even far from half - filling it",
    "is possible to define a crossover @xmath125 , beyond which the flow in the e - h channel disappears exponentially .",
    "we can summarize saying that for any filling , @xmath125 is a crossover from a regime where both e  e and e  h loops contribute to a regime where @xmath116 starts to behave like @xmath126 . here",
    "@xmath127 is positive for all values of the momentum transfer @xmath128 .    to estimate the dependence of @xmath125 on the filling @xmath129 , we consider the static limit of the partially integrated e - h loop @xmath130 with the momentum transfer * q * equal to @xmath131 in the direction @xmath132 .",
    "note that the energy integration is performed over @xmath133 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath134 with respect to @xmath34 gives the explicit @xmath34-dependence in the @xmath135 functional .",
    "2 shows @xmath136 and @xmath137 for two different values of @xmath18 .",
    "it is reasonable to define @xmath125 as the point where @xmath137 starts to decrease . in the exponential regime",
    "the function @xmath137 decays like @xmath138 ( i.e. @xmath139 , valid for any orientation of @xmath140 ) , while the regime @xmath141 remembers the @xmath142 divergence of @xmath143 at half filling .",
    "if we consider @xmath136 for some large momentum transfer different from @xmath131 ( giving intersection rather than touching of the initial- and final - state fermi surface ) we get a shape like @xmath144 ( i.e. @xmath145 ) . the dependence @xmath146 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "near @xmath147 there is a divergence of the form @xmath148 because of nesting , while the increasing @xmath125 as the filling goes to zero mirrors the fact that , for low density , the fermi energy appears as the new scale instead of the band - width being used .",
    "the insert shows the function @xmath149 .",
    "once in the exponential regime , @xmath116 can be neglected after it becomes smaller than @xmath150 of its value at @xmath151 .",
    "putting @xmath152 , this defines the crossover @xmath153 corresponding to the crossover temperature @xmath154 .",
    "suppose that we now integrate the flow equation ( [ flowu ] ) from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "once @xmath34 has reached @xmath157 , only the term @xmath158 remains in the flow equations , and one has a partially renormalized @xmath159 as initial condition .",
    "now we use the fact that @xmath160 is a small parameter , i.e. the inequality @xmath161 determines a thin ring of degrees of freedom , containing no van hove points , as one can conclude looking at fig.3 .",
    "this allows us to rescale the momenta @xmath162 , where @xmath163 is the unit vector normal to fermi surface , dependent on direction of * k*. to clarify the reason for which a tree - level scaling is not allowed for energies higher than the deviation of the fermi level from van hove singularity , let us write the phase space integration measure in terms of energy @xmath164 and polar angle @xmath165 variables @xmath166 with @xmath167 , @xmath168 being the radial wave number and @xmath169 the group - velocity .",
    "zeroth order ( tree level ) scaling tells us via power counting argument to consider @xmath170 as function of @xmath171 , neglecting any @xmath84 dependence about @xmath172 , which is possible if @xmath170 is an analytic function of @xmath84 at the whole shell @xmath173 which , consequently , should contain no singularity .",
    "we can also rescale the frequencies if @xmath174 is an analytic function of @xmath175 in the interval @xmath176 about the fermi surface , which we assume to be the case@xcite . in the scope of this tree - level scaling , as it has already been shown by shankar @xcite , the slope of the electronic dispersion around the fermi surface is irrelevant and the two marginal interactions correspond to two different constraints on the four - momenta in @xmath1 .",
    "since any @xmath177- and @xmath178-dependence in @xmath1 is irrelevant , both marginal interactions depend only on coordinates of the zero frequency particles placed at the fermi surface .",
    "for the first , `` fermi liquid '' or forward interaction , the momenta satisfy the equation @xmath179 , where the meaning of momenta can be seen from the equation ( [ act ] ) .",
    "this interaction is slightly @xmath180 renormalized by the high - energy - modes ( @xmath181 ) , and is not involved in further renormalization .",
    "the second interaction is the pairing potential @xmath5 , where the momenta satisfy the condition @xmath182 .",
    "the pairing @xmath5 depends only on angular coordinates of annihilated and created pairs .",
    "keeping in mind the above remarks , we can write the action for the electrons in the ring @xmath176 around the fermi surface as @xmath183 @xmath184 where @xmath185 , closed loop integrations are over the the fermi surface and @xmath186 stands for the effective fermi liquid interaction .",
    "@xmath187 is the energy - integrated number of pairs defined as @xmath188 note that the integration measure over small momentum @xmath189 goes to zero as @xmath190 .",
    "a form similar to ( [ hlin ] ) has been used by weinberg@xcite , but taking @xmath191 phenomenologically and not as the partially renormalized pairing interaction which we get from @xmath192 putting incoming particles 1 and 2 to @xmath193 and @xmath194 and outgoing 3 and 4 to @xmath195 and @xmath196 . note that the loop integration over @xmath51 can be understood as the scalar product over `` vector components '' of a `` spin '' , where the number of components @xmath197 corresponds to @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "the integrations have the weight factor @xmath199 , @xmath200 being the anisotropic fermi velocity , what suggests to introduce a new angular coordinate @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the function @xmath203 is shown in fig.4 for few different values of @xmath18 .",
    "starting from the new hamiltonian ( [ hlin ] ) we can calculate now the function @xmath204 in @xmath205-space and obtain the flow - equation    @xmath206    where the coordinate @xmath205 appears instead of @xmath207 .",
    "for initial condition we take @xmath208 .",
    "to make the differential equation ( [ flowv ] ) solvable one has to diagonalize the pairing potential @xmath209@xcite since it is invariant under all symmetry elements of the @xmath210 point group , its most general form in @xmath205-space can be written as @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the function @xmath214 is the @xmath215 basis state of the @xmath216representation of the point group @xmath210 .",
    "it is proportional to the function @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 $ ] , for @xmath222 , and @xmath223 respectively . using ( [ decomp ] ) ,",
    "the flow equation ( [ flowv ] ) becomes @xmath224 with the initial condition @xmath225 to solve exactly the equation ( [ flowdec ] ) one has to diagonalize five infinite dimensional matrices @xmath226 , thus decoupling completely the flow ( [ flowdec ] ) into a set of differential equations whose solution is @xmath227 here @xmath228 labels the eigenvalues within the representation @xmath216 .",
    "if @xmath229 is negative , the denominator has a zero at @xmath230 and an instability occurs .",
    "the renormalization group calculation of the pairing interaction @xmath231 is an extremely difficult problem because of the interplay between the cutoff @xmath0 and the geometry of the two - dimensional shells @xmath232 .",
    "however for some range of @xmath233 and @xmath19 ( essentially small @xmath19 and @xmath234 not too close to half - filling ) the problem can be reduced to only one simple integration , i.e. @xmath235 with @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the partially integrated e - e loop , defined in a same way as @xmath136 in eq.([bubble ] ) .",
    "@xmath136 comes just from the last diagram in the expression for @xmath44 in fig . 1 , because the other three e - h loops cancel exactly for any @xmath1 symmetric under exchange .",
    "the approximation ( [ vco ] ) is allowed if @xmath238 is a small parameter . a good estimate of the magnitude of this parameter is given by the @xmath239-part of @xmath240 , giving the criterion for the validity of our approach in @xmath241-space .",
    "the line @xmath242 is shown in fig .",
    "5 . below the line",
    "the approximation ( [ i0 ] ) is justified .    by definition of @xmath157 , @xmath243 .",
    "moreover , @xmath244 has no dependence on @xmath205 and @xmath245 , since it depends on external momenta only through @xmath246 , which we put to zero .",
    "consequently , its only nonzero component is @xmath247 .",
    "thus , for the calculation of all other components of @xmath248 we use just the bubble @xmath249 with the momentum transfer @xmath250 .",
    "fig.6(a ) shows @xmath249 as a function of @xmath205 and @xmath245 for chemical potential @xmath251 .",
    "the minimal eigenvalues of @xmath231 in all five channels , named @xmath252 , are shown in fig.6(b ) as functions of @xmath18 .",
    "these curves indicate which kind of superconducting symmetry becomes critical at some given @xmath18 .",
    "the eigenvalues for each channel are calculated taking only the first four harmonics for @xmath239 , @xmath253 , @xmath10 and @xmath8 , and the first six harmonics for the @xmath223 representation .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors determine the fourier spectrum of the gap function .",
    "a very important result is that the relevant harmonic of the superconducting fluctuations in the @xmath10 channel occurs very close to just @xmath254 , being thus determined only by the structure of the fermi surface and not by the interaction .",

    "the critical temperature decreases extremely fast as we go away from the half - filling .",
    "an increase of @xmath19 could save the situation , but in that case our perturbative method ceases to be sufficient ( see fig .",
    "5 ) . since the cuprates are superconductors for fillings quite far from one electron per site ( @xmath267 )",
    ", this result means that the small-@xmath1 hubbard model can not describe these systems quantitatively .",
    "however , the model gives very precious informations about the form of the gap function in the @xmath10instable regime , which will not change considerably with increasing @xmath19 , as long as @xmath268 is the dominant attractive harmonic in @xmath231 .",
    "once the renormalization flow has been integrated for @xmath181 , assuming that the interaction did not diverge earlier in the antiferromagnetic channel , the detailed angular dependence of the superconducting gap function can be easily found . in general , a superconducting state with the symmetry corresponding to the lowest of the eigenvalues @xmath269 will be formed .",
    "however , when two of the @xmath269 are close to each other , a more complicated situation can occur : for definiteness , consider the region @xmath270 in fig.6(b ) , where the @xmath8 eigenvalue is the most attractive after the @xmath10 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath10 order of the simplest form @xmath271 has formed and that the temperature is close to @xmath13 . among the remaining symmetry channels ,",
    "@xmath8 is the only one which can give a large gap function in the node - points of @xmath259 and zero in the points where @xmath259 is maximal .",
    "consequently , we expect that the flow of the type ( [ solution ] ) with @xmath272 will not be strongly affected by the existing @xmath10 order .",
    "considering to a first approximation the two flow equations ( @xmath273 and @xmath272 ) as independent , and taking only the first harmonics of the @xmath10 and @xmath8 representations , we can construct the relevant part of the pairing interaction which gives two phase transitions , one with @xmath10 and the other with @xmath8-symmetry : @xmath274 where all details of the fermi surface are contained in the dependence of @xmath205 on @xmath171 . from eq.([solution ] ) one finds that the ratio between two critical temperatures is given by @xmath275 $ ] . from fig.6(b ) note that the ratio @xmath276 is very sensitive to the variation of the chemical potential .",
    "the gap function resulting from ( [ vapr ] ) has the form @xmath277 where @xmath259 , @xmath255 , @xmath278 and @xmath279 are real .",
    "these parameters can be determined minimizing the mean - field expression for the free energy per site@xcite @xmath280 where @xmath281 and the theta function constrains the momentum summation to run only over the states within the energy shell @xmath176 about the fermi surface .",
    "the minimization of @xmath282 with respect to @xmath283 gives @xmath284 i.e. the resulting gap function is of the type @xmath285 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the same kind of gap function has been obtained by laughlin using the anyon picture.@xcite the particularity of this gap function ( and of any gap consisting of two different symmetry terms with a phase difference of @xmath286 ) is that it breaks time reversal symmetry .",
    "we can now try to understand recent arpes measurements by jian ma and coworkers @xcite on the bi2212 compound . from their experiment",
    "it appears that two superconducting instabilities occur ; the first one is at @xmath287 and has probably the @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "the second instability occurs at @xmath288 ; it introduces a nonzero gap at the points @xmath289 , i.e. halfway between the corners of the half - filled fermi .",
    "the function measured by arpes is @xmath290 and in the picture discussed above has no zeros and minima on the diagonals of the brillouin zone if both @xmath259 and @xmath255 are finite , @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "this is in agreement with the experiments because the gap in the diagonal direction is just equal to @xmath255 , introduced at @xmath293 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath290 on the diagonals is in agreement with other arpes experiments@xcite as well .",
    "one should of course notice that in our model closeness of two different @xmath228 s only occurs in very narrow parts of the parameter space and therefore to a certain degree is accidental .",
    "we have formulated the one - loop renormalization group for a two - dimensional system of interacting electrons on a square lattice , described by the hubbard model . for band filling different from one - half , the renormalization flow for @xmath34 superior to some crossover @xmath157 comes only from the contribution due to the electron - electron bubble - diagram , while the electron - hole contribution decays exponentially as @xmath294 , where @xmath157 depends on band filling , but is independent on the strength of the interaction .",
    "we decompose the bcs pairing interaction @xmath5 for electrons in the vicinity of the fermi surface in fourier components of the five irreducible representations of the @xmath210 point group , defined at the fermi surface .",
    "diagonalizing @xmath231 in each representation , we get five sets of decoupled bcs flow equations .",
    "the minimal ( i.e. the most negative ) eigenvalue of @xmath231 determines the critical temperature and the eigenvector gives the form of the gap function . unlike the usual approach,@xcite",
    "the characteristic of the procedure presented here to obtain the symmetry of the gap function is that only the axial coordinates at the fermi surface is relevant , while the radial dependence is `` scaled out '' .",
    "moreover , the renormalization group treatment of the whole brillouin zone , and not only of the narrow belt about the fermi surface has allowed us to show that the origin of the attractive part of the pairing interaction in the hubbard model is in electron - hole fluctuations on rather high energy scales , up to the bandwidth .",
    "we have calculated @xmath231 for the case where the flow due to the electron - hole channel can be treated perturbatively , i.e. when the filling is far enough from one - half .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath5 in terms of angular harmonics gave us the type of superconducting instability : for weak filling , the instability occurs in the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) singlet channel , while for filling close to one - half , the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) singlet instability strongly overwhelms all others , what are the results in agreement with previous work.@xcite particularly interesting is the fact that the order parameter @xmath295 can be very well approximated by the function @xmath261 , where the function @xmath203 depends only on the anisotropic fermi velocity and on the geometry of the fermi surface .",
    "this gives for @xmath295 a function that has peaks in the directions of the van hove singularities .",
    "the slope of the peaks increases as we approach half - filling .",
    "this can be a justification to consider the interaction only between electrons in the close vicinity of the van hove points as relevant if we are very close to half - filling @xcite .",
    "we believe that the form of @xmath295 does not depend considerably on the strength of interaction , and recent t - matrix calculations @xcite for realistic values of the interaction @xmath19 give a gap function in accord with our assumptions .",
    "we find a superconducting instability at any electron concentration away from half  filling .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism , namely exchange of spin or charge density fluctuations , is the same as in previous approaches.@xcite we do however feel that our present results are on a more solid footing than the previous work because the present one  loop renormalization group scheme does not make any a priori assumptions about important or unimportant diagrams and provides a more systematic way of handling the dynamics of the fluctuations being exchanged .",
    "the only restrictions come from ( i ) the limitation to one  loop order , necessitating weak coupling , and ( ii ) the requirement that the e - h diagram are a perturbation with respect to the e - e diagrams , implying that we can not be too close to half  filling .",
    "the region of validity of the approach is shown in fig.5 .",
    "further , self ",
    "energy diagrams have been neglected , however , these are expected to produce important effects only at two  loop order , and therefore are expected to be negligible in weak coupling .    in our weak coupling model",
    "the superconducting critical temperature is negligible ( but it exists , for any filling ! ) if we are not in the immediate vicinity of half - filling , which means that the hubbard model with small @xmath19 and small ( perturbative ) antiferromagnetic fluctuations does not suffice to describe the high critical temperature ( @xmath296 ) of the cuprates .",
    "there exist two possible ways ( related to two restrictions of our calculations ) to increase the critical temperature .",
    "the first is to simply increase @xmath19 and to remain far from the half - filling , keeping the e - h channel non - singular . to treat this case ,",
    "an approach perturbative in @xmath19 is possibly only of limited use .",
    "ideally , renormalization should be done exactly , and not using a simple one - loop ( or @xmath297-loop ) scheme ( which is actually just an `` intelligent '' version of the perturbative summation ) .",
    "we can speculate and suppose that even in the case of strong coupling there exists the crossover @xmath298 , above which the flow is of the bcs type .",
    "it is to expect that @xmath298 is not very different from @xmath157 that we have calculated .",
    "this means that the cutoff @xmath299 for the effective bcs theory is @xmath300 ( see fig.3 . and eq.([co ] ) ) , where @xmath38 is the initial cutoff of the theory , equal to @xmath301 .",
    "the second possibility to increase @xmath13 is to approach half - filling very closely , making fermi surface nesting important but remaining in a weak - coupling regime . for that case , a simplified one - loop renormalization group calculations",
    "@xcite has shown that superconductivity wins over antiferromagnetism only if the e - h contribution to the flow decays before the divergence in the antiferromagnetic channel takes place .",
    "thus , we can say that here too , the effective theory is of bcs type . the difference with the first scenario is that the effective cutoff is very small ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and that the coupling constant is very strong , due to the strong flow in both e - e and e - h channels at all scales @xmath181 .",
    "a very important feature of the nested case with a small @xmath19 is that it can be treated in terms of the one - loop renormalization group , renormalizing @xmath1 as a function only of three angular variables .",
    "this is allowed because all important physics ( i.e. the majority of the e - e and e - h flow ) is contained in the vicinity of the fermi surface , making the effective phase space to be a rather narrow square ring @xmath302 ; @xmath303 where the marginally relevant interaction is a function only of the angular position of the particles on the ring .",
    "finally , we have discussed the possibility of a superconducting state with a mixed symmetry . in the presence of @xmath10 order , the flow in the @xmath8 channel ( which is the second most attractive one for @xmath304 )",
    "will be only weakly affected by a nonzero order parameter of @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "this gives rise to two superconducting instabilities , with the critical temperatures @xmath13 for the @xmath10 and @xmath305 for the @xmath8 channel , and @xmath306 .",
    "we have given the form of the pairing function for the effective bcs theory .",
    "at @xmath307 the relative phase of two order parameters is @xmath292 .",
    "the resulting form of the energy gap @xmath308 has no zeros and minima are in diagonal directions , providing a possible qualitative explanation of arpes experiments by shen@xcite and the decrease of the anisotropy with decreasing @xmath309.@xcite      for recent short overview see : j. r. schrieffer , solid state commun . *",
