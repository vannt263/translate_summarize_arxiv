    "cepheids are important standard candles in determining the extra - galactic distance scale .",
    "the results of the hipparcos  mission allow , in principle , a calibration of the period - luminosity relation based on the available parallaxes .",
    "feast & catchpole ( 1997 ; hereafter fc ) did just that for the @xmath12-relation based on pre - released hipparcos  data of 223 cepheids available to them at that time .",
    "now that the entire catalog has become available ( esa 1997 ) it is timely to analyse the full sample of cepheids in it .    in a recent paper , lanoix et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter l99 ) presented a study similar to ours and they derived the zero points of the @xmath13- and @xmath14-relations , without , however , discussing the distance to the lmc .",
    "we will indicate where the two studies agree and differ .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "2 the sample considered in the present paper is presented , and compared to that in fc and l99 . in sect .",
    "3 several aspects involved in the analysis of parallax data are described , and the method of `` reduced parallaxes '' is outlined , together with all necessary recipes to obtain the reddening . in sect .",
    "4 the zero points of the @xmath4-relations in @xmath15 and the reddening - free `` wesenheit - index '' ( e.g. tanvir 1999 , and eq .  ( 11 ) ) are presented for different selections of the sample , which are discussed in sect .",
    "5 . in sect .",
    "6 we construct and present the zero points for volume complete samples of stars . in sect .",
    "7 we describe numerical simulations that are first of all tuned to fit the observed properties of the cepheids  in the hipparcos  catalog , and then are used to show that the method of `` reduced parallaxes '' introduces a bias which is of the order of 0.01 mag or less .",
    "based on these results we discuss in sect .  8 the distance to the lmc , and elaborate on the various uncertainties .",
    "the number and some properties of the cepheid population in the hipparcoscatalog were discussed by groenewegen ( 1999 , hereafter g99 ) .",
    "to summarise : by cross - correlating the general hipparcos  database , the hipparcos``resolved variable catalog '' and the electronic database of fernie et al .",
    "( 1995 ; hereafter f95 ) , a total of 280 cepheids  was identified . then",
    ", 9 type ii cepheids , 1 factual rr lyrae variable , 1 ch - like carbon - rich cepheid , 10 double - mode cepheids , 7 cepheids with an unreliable hipparcossolution and 4 cepheids  with no or unreliable optical photometry were excluded .",
    "note that for ry sco and y lac we use the new determinations for the parallax and its error from falin & mignard ( 1999 ) .",
    "this leaves 248 stars , of which 32 are classified as overtone pulsators by f95 , antonello et al .",
    "( 1990 ) or sachkov ( 1997 ) .",
    "luri et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have classified cepheids  in fundamental and overtone pulsators using the hipparcos  lightcurves , but did not yet publish the results for individual stars . for the sample ,",
    "g99 calculated intensity - mean @xmath3 ( on the cousins system ) and @xmath16 magnitudes for 189 stars , and collected magnitude - mean colours for additional 14 stars , and provided @xmath17 intensity - mean magnitudes on the carter system for 69 stars . + by comparison , the fc dataset consisted of 223 stars of which 3 were discarded .",
    "these were dp vel for lack of photometric data , and aw per and ax cir because they are in binaries and the photometry might be affected by the companions .",
    "however , in the f95 catalog there are many more stars which are flagged for this reason . from the sample in g99",
    "are therefore excluded the stars flagged `` o c '' ( rx cam , aw per , t mon , ss cma , s mus , ax cir , w sgr , v350 sgr , u aql , su cyg , v1334 cyg ) and `` o : c '' ( vy car ) in f95 .",
    "this leaves 32 overtone pulsators and 204 fundamental mode pulsators in the sample considered here .",
    "they are listed for completeness in appendix a together with some adopted parameters .",
    "+ recently , l99 also studied the cepheids  in the hipparcos  catalog .",
    "they selected stars listed as `` dcep '' or `` dceps '' from the hipparcos  catalog .",
    "interestingly , they state that they selected 247 stars , while in reality there are 250 such stars ( g99 ) . after removing 9 cepheids",
    "for which there is no photometry listed in f95 , their final sample consists of of 238 stars ( including 31 overtones ) .",
    "they did not eliminate double - mode cepheids , cepheids  where the photometry is ( likely ) contaminated by a binary companion or cepheids  with unreliable hipparcossolutions .",
    "furthermore , they assumed all cepheids  classified as `` dceps '' to be overtone pulsators , which is not the case .",
    "their sample therefore includes stars they consider overtones which we and fc consider fundamental mode pulsators ( e.g. , sz cas , y oph , v496 aql , v924 cyg , v532 cyg ) , and stars they consider fundamental mode pulsators which are overtone pulsators ( e.g. , v465 mon , dk vel , v950 sco , see mantegazza & poretti 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , v473 lyr is considered by them to be a first overtone pulsator , while it probably is a second overtone pulsator ( van hoolst & waelkens 1995 ; andrievsky et al .",
    "1998 ; also see below ) .",
    "+ of the 236 stars in our sample there are 198 in common with the sample of fc . in other words , 22 stars in the fc sample would not have made it through the selection process outlined in g99 and here .",
    "specifically , their sample contains 7 stars with unreliable hipparcossolutions ( we use the improved parallax values for ry sco and y lac from falin & mignard ( 1999 ) , information which was not available to fc ) , 9 binaries ( in addition to aw per and ax cir ) where the photometry may be contaminated by the companions and 8 double - mode cepheids .",
    "another difference is that 7 more stars than in fc are flagged as overtone pulsators following f95 and sachkov ( 1997 ) .",
    "+ for the 198 stars in common we have compared the intensity - mean @xmath2 and @xmath18 .",
    "fc mention that they use f95 , except when the data were in laney & stobie ( 1993 ) .",
    "our photometry was at first instance taken solely from f95 , except for rw cas ( see discussion in g99 ) . in @xmath2 ,",
    "the photometry is identical for 165 stars . for 18 stars @xmath2 differs by @xmath19mag , for 8 by @xmath20mag and for 5 by @xmath21mag .",
    "the latter cases were inspected individually .    for rw cas the difference in the sense ``",
    "fernie et al @xmath22 fc '' is 0.101 mag . as discussed in g99 , there may be a typographical error in f95 .    for x pup the difference is @xmath23 .",
    "the f95 entry of @xmath2 = 8.460 is close to the value derived in g99 for the dataset of moffett & barnes ( 1984 ) .",
    "the other dataset considered in g99 gives a value of @xmath24 .",
    "the value by fc of @xmath25 is intermediate .",
    "we have kept the f95 value .    for aq pup",
    "the difference is 0.122 mag .",
    "g99 calculated @xmath26 for 3 data sets .",
    "the entry in f95 ( @xmath27 ) is identical to the moffett & barnes ( 1984 ) dataset .",
    "the fc value of @xmath28 is close to the 2 other datasets ( 8.676 , 8.686 mag ) , and one of these was the preferred one in g99 regarding the @xmath26 photometry . for aq pup",
    "we use the @xmath2 and @xmath18 from fc .",
    "for rs pup the difference is @xmath29 .",
    "the value in f95 ( @xmath2 = 6.947 ) is clearly off from both values in g99 ( 6.999 and 7.020 mag ) which both are in agreement with the value of @xmath2 = 7.028 used by fc .",
    "for rs pup we use @xmath2 and @xmath18 from fc .    for s nor",
    "the difference is @xmath30 .",
    "the value used by fc is extremely close to the value derived in g99 , and for s nor we use the @xmath2 and @xmath18 from fc .    after these changes in @xmath2 and @xmath18 , there are 164 with identical values for @xmath18 , for 12 stars @xmath18 differs by @xmath31 mag , for 9 by @xmath32 mag , and for 5 by @xmath33 mag ( rw cas , x pup , u nor , ry sco , ru sct ) .",
    "these cases have not been considered separately .",
    "it merely indicates that errors in @xmath2 and @xmath18 ( and hence reddening ) can contribute to the uncertainties in the derivation of the zero point of the @xmath4-relation , as will be discussed below .    for v1162 aql",
    ", we discovered an error in the @xmath34 value listed in f95 . from the data in berdnikov & turner ( 1995 ) that was used in g99 to calculate @xmath35 we derive and",
    "adopt an intensity weighted mean of @xmath34 = 0.879 magnitudes .    in g99 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 photometry",
    "was presented for many cepheids  in the hipparcoscatalog , based on a literature search .",
    "when possible , intensity - mean magnitudes were calculated based on the original published datasets .",
    "some magnitude - means were also presented .",
    "the @xmath36 magnitudes are taken from g99 .",
    "when there are multiple entries the first one was taken following the considerations in g99 . in total there is @xmath3-band data for 191 stars ( or 81% of the sample ) , 178 of which are intensity - mean magnitudes . in g99",
    "it was shown that there is no significant difference between the intensity - mean and magnitude - mean , and so the remaining 13 magnitude - means are used without correction .",
    "g99 also presented intensity - mean @xmath17 magnitudes in , or transformed to , the carter system . when there are multiple entries the first one is taken , following the considerations in g99 . in total there is @xmath17-band data for 63 stars , or 27% of the sample .",
    "analysing parallax data is not a trivial exercise , and has led to some confusion in the literature .",
    "part of this confusion is probably related to the fact that parallax data suffer from many types of biases ( see brown et al .",
    "for example , the most conspicuous bias , the lutz - kelker ( lk ; lutz & kelker 1973 ) bias , although known for a long time , could not be empirically investigated due to a lack of data on which it could be tested .",
    "one can visualize the lk effect by analogy with the well - known malmquist bias .",
    "malmquist bias occurs on samples of objects because due to a particular magnitude cut , objects that are brighter than the mean will be included in a sample , while objects that are fainter than the mean will be excluded .",
    "the net effect of this type of bias is that the intrinsic magnitude for a certain sample will be too bright if no corrections are applied . to investigate the presence of such biases",
    ", one can look at so - called spaenhauer diagrams , where the observed magnitude is plotted as a function of , for example , distance .",
    "in such a way it is relatively easy to find the point where the malmquist bias starts to dominate ( see e.g. sandage 1994 ) .",
    "a similar , but opposite effect , is due to the lk bias . for",
    "a given parallax cut ( or any selection based on the parallax , or its associated error ) , on average , more objects that are located far away will scatter into the sample , than stars will scatter out of the sample , as the sampled volume is larger for the former objects . because the distances to the objects scattered into the sample are then underestimated",
    ", this effectively results in a too faint mean ` intrinsic ' magnitude of the entire sample . as with the malmquist bias",
    ", the lk - bias depends on the space distribution of the sample of stars under consideration .",
    "contrary also to the malmquist bias is that although the error - bars on the parallax are symmetric , those on the derived distances and intrinsic magnitudes are a - symmetric , which seriously affects the analysis of the data . in addition , the relative error - bars on the parallax increase with distance .    the lk bias was shown to exist empirically by oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . figure  1 gives an illustrative plot , showing the magnitudes of the cepheids under consideration , derived from their photometry and observed parallax , as a function of parallax in the upper panel , and as function of relative error in the lower panel ( @xmath37 , for @xmath38  see next section for details ) .",
    "as the absolute error in the hipparcos  data is more or less constant , the two figures are equivalent .",
    "the inferred magnitude of the objects in the cepheid sample is not a random distribution around the mean , but shows a clear trend as function of parallax . for large parallaxes ( and small relative errors )",
    "the inferred magnitudes are too faint , and then , for larger distances , the objects become too bright .",
    "it was only in oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , that this was shown empirically for the first time .",
    "indeed , it is clear from this type of graph , which is a version of a spaenhauer diagram , that a selection on parallax ( or relative error in parallax ) will not return the correct answer . in most cases",
    "the result will be biased ( but see oudmaijer et al .",
    "1999 , for a counter - example ) .",
    "lutz & kelker ( 1973 ) were the first to investigate this effect , and found that the resulting bias can be substantial , increasing with increasing relative error .",
    "for a relative error of 17.5% in the parallax , the bias is 0.43 magnitudes  yet as koen ( 1992 ) later showed , the confidence intervals around these corrections are large .",
    "the 17.5% limit was taken literally by subsequent authors , and often stars with worse determinations were deleted or individual stars were corrected with the values lk derived .",
    "lk claimed that individual stars suffer from the same bias , a point they emphasize strongly .",
    "actually , it is quite a surprising result that lk concluded that individual stars are biased .",
    "lk start their calculations assuming that the observed parallax equals the true parallax with a random error , a standard procedure when investigating measurement errors and the main assumption for monte - carlo simulations as performed in e.g. sect .",
    "7 of this paper .",
    "it seems rather contradictory then that lk infer from their results that individual stars are biased if their initial conditions assume otherwise .",
    "let us first comment on whether the conjecture that the observed parallax is equal to the true parallax ( plus a random observational error ) is correct .",
    "it is actually quite hard to investigate this in a `",
    "bias - free ' manner , but the evidence provided by the hipparcos  mission swings the balance towards answering this question with a ` yes ' . measurements of stars beyond the detection limit of hipparcos , such as those in the magellanic clouds ( van leeuwen 1997 , arenou et al .",
    "1995 ) consistently give average observed parallaxes close to zero mas with a scatter of order the observational error .",
    "this indicates that the measurements are not biased , even though the relative errors on the parallax are substantial  and the results for individual stars can be widely off the true distance , but crucially , in the mean they appear to give the right answer within the errors rather than show a conspicuous bias in one direction .",
    "in addition , analyses of open clusters , for which photometric distances are known , do not show a deviation from the mean distance for increasing distances and thus lower quality data ( arenou et al .",
    "1995 , robichon et al .",
    "1999 ) . based on this",
    ", it appears that individual stellar determinations are most likely not biased .",
    "there is one exception , mentioned briefly by koen & laney ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors argue that if a single star is the result of a selection on parallax , its measurement is biased .",
    "although this sounds counter - intuitive , it is a formal implication from the fact that a selection on parallax gives rise to a bias . a final comment concerns the use of parallaxes of a sample of which one does not know that the objects should have the same intrinsic magnitude , while their distances are not known .",
    "the trend observed in fig .  1",
    "that , for a given sample , large parallaxes return in principle too faint intrinsic magnitudes , while small parallaxes return too bright magnitudes , can have serious implications in the interpretation of the data .",
    "the remaining question is how one should deal with the effects of the bias",
    ". should one , as often the case with malmquist bias , introduce a ( sample - dependent ) correction factor , or are there ways to circumvent the problem ?    in a paper dealing with this problem ,",
    "turon lacarrieu & crz ( 1977 ) discuss two different methods :    accepting that a sample selected on parallax is inevitably biased , they first considered using the better parallaxes , and investigate the resulting mean magnitudes , and provide corrections along similar lines as lk ( also see smith 1987a+b+c , koen 1992 ) .",
    "secondly they considered a full sample , and , avoiding transformations from parallaxes to distances and magnitudes , they derive the mean parallax first and use the resulting mean parallax to derive the mean magnitude of the sample . since negative parallaxes can not be incorporated into a mean magnitude , one in principle has to discard these data , in effect selecting on parallax and thus biasing the sample .",
    "therefore , turon lacarrieu & crz ( 1977 ) introduced the so - called `` reduced parallax '' ( 10@xmath39 ) , which can take into account negative parallaxes , and hence the ( weighted ) mean of the reduced parallax can be converted into a mean magnitude .",
    "this method , as will be discussed in sect .",
    "3.2 , indeed appears to be `` bias - free '' , mainly because a weighting scheme puts less weight on the larger deviations around the mean from the lower quality data , whilst not being a formal selection on parallax .",
    "the cepheids in hipparcos  were investigated previously by fc who used the second , reduced parallax method , and oudmaijer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who used a scheme based on the first method .",
    "their results were equal within the error - bars .",
    "although fc used the reduced parallax method , which formally does not suffer from lk bias ( koen & laney 1998 ) , they still suggested in a footnote that a lk correction of 0.02 mag should be applied on their final result .",
    "this is not necessary ; the result only has to be corrected for malmquist bias , as fc also pointed out , but did not actually apply , as they estimated it would essentially counteract their proposed lk correction of 0.02 mag .",
    "these , and other issues will be investigated in the remainder of this paper .",
    "first , we will outline the method for the reduced parallaxes again .",
    "the method of `` reduced parallax '' ( discussed by turon lacarrieu & crz 1977 ) was the one used by fc in analysing cepheid data . + consider a period - luminosity relation of the form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fundamental period in days .",
    "if @xmath42 is the intensity - mean visual magnitude and @xmath43 its reddening corrected value , then one can write : @xmath44 which defines the expression rhs and where @xmath45 is the parallax in milli - arcseconds .",
    "this method has the advantage that negative parallaxes can be used in the analyses as well . a weighted - mean , with error , of the quantity 10@xmath46",
    "is calculated , with the weight ( weight = @xmath47 ) for the individual stars derived from : @xmath48 with @xmath49 the standard error in the parallax .",
    "this follows from the propagation - of - errors in eq .",
    "( 2 ) . for the error ( denoted @xmath50 ) in @xmath51",
    "we follow fc s `` solution b '' and adopt @xmath52 throughout this paper . recently , l99 considered alternative weighting schemes , but concluded that the one used by fc and the present paper gives the most reliable zero point and the lowest dispersion .",
    "+ the reddening is derived as follows .",
    "the intrinsic colours follow from the relation in laney & stobie ( 1994 ) : @xmath53 which has a dispersion of 0.091 mag . the visual extinction ( @xmath54 ) is calculated using ( laney & stobie 1993 ) : @xmath55 no dispersion is given for this relation , only an error of 0.03 in the zero point .",
    "we will assume that the dispersion in eq .",
    "( 5 ) is slightly larger than this , namely 0.05 mag .    for overtone pulsators ,",
    "the fundamental period has to be estimated from the observed period .",
    "this was done , following fc , using : @xmath56 with a dispersion we estimate from the original data ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) to be of order 0.002 .    for pulsators in the second overtone ,",
    "the fundamental period is calculated , following fc , using : @xmath57 this completes the description of the method used by fc . + alternative methods which are described now , follow this description closely but are based on @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively @xmath60 and @xmath61 photometry instead of @xmath62 and @xmath58 .",
    "the rationale being that the extinction in @xmath3 and @xmath8 is less than in @xmath2 , and that the scatter in the @xmath63- and @xmath64-relations is less than in the @xmath65-relation ( tanvir 1999 , laney & stobie 1994 ) .",
    "+ first consider the case based on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the intrinsic colour is derived from ( caldwell & coulson 1986 ) : @xmath66 which has a dispersion of 0.064 mag .",
    "this relation was derived for magnitude - mean @xmath67 but we will assume it to hold for intensity - mean magnitudes as well .",
    "in a recent paper , feast ( 1999 , appendix d ) , presents a correction formula that implies that the difference intensity - mean minus magnitude - mean @xmath35 colour is of order @xmath68 mag for a typical @xmath2-band amplitude of 0.7 mag .",
    "+ there seems not to exist a relation similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) , where @xmath69 is related to @xmath70 and/or @xmath71 .",
    "we have derived such a relation from the available @xmath72 data .    for each star with @xmath72 photometry , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 8) . then , @xmath75 is calculated using gieren et al .",

    ". a least - square fit to 183 data points gives : @xmath79 with no significant dependence on @xmath67 and with a standard error of 0.19 .",
    "for @xmath50 ( in this case the error in @xmath80 ) ) we adopt a value of 0.15 mag ( tanvir 1999 ) .",
    "+ a variation on this method that treats the problem of reddening in a different way , is to use the reddening - free so - called `` wesenheit - index '' ( see for example tanvir 1999 ) , that uses the _ observed _ colours but is essentially reddening - free when defined as : @xmath81 for @xmath50 ( in this case the error in @xmath82 ) ) we adopt a value of 0.11 mag ( tanvir 1999 ) . + now consider the case based on @xmath83 and @xmath8 colours .",
    "the intrinsic color is derived from laney & stobie ( 1994 ) : @xmath84 which has a dispersion of 0.044 mag .",
    "again , there seems not to exist a relation similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) , where @xmath85 is related to @xmath86 and/or @xmath87 .",
    "we have derived such a relation from the available @xmath88 data .    for each star with @xmath88 photometry , @xmath73 and @xmath86",
    "can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "then , @xmath89 is calculated using laney & stobie ( 1993 ) : @xmath90 in fig .",
    "3 @xmath91 is plotted versus @xmath92",
    ". a least - square fit to 55 data points gives : @xmath93 with a standard error of 0.091 .",
    "for @xmath50 ( in this case the error in @xmath94 ) ) we adopt a value of 0.12 mag ( gieren et al .",
    "in tables  1 - 4 we present the results from the `` reduced parallax '' method presented in the previous section for different samples of stars , and based on different colors ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 or @xmath98 ) . to test the implementation of the method we have calculated the zero point for some of the solutions considered in fc , adopting a slope @xmath99 and working with @xmath96 colours , as they did . the data for the sample used by fc come from feast & whitelock ( 1997 ; their table  1 ) .",
    "these are our solutions 1 - 7 in table  1 , and the value for the zero point and total weight are in perfect agreement to within the listed number of decimal places in fc .",
    "the error in the zero point determination is slightly different , ours being larger by a few 1/100-th of a magnitude . using the fc sample , we also calculated the solution for the overtones only , and the overtones excluding polaris ( solutions 8 - 9 ) . +",
    "for the present sample and using a slope @xmath38 solutions 10 - 12 give the value for the zero point for the whole sample , and for fundamental mode and overtone pulsators separately . in this case , v473 lyr was considered to be pulsating in the second overtone .",
    "this interesting object is thought to be the only galactic cepheid pulsating in the second overtone ( van hoolst & waelkens 1995 and andrievsky et al .",
    "the values of @xmath100 assuming that v473 lyr is a fundamental mode , first overtone or second overtone pulsator , respectively , are @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , all with an error of 0.70 . with such a large error only fundamental mode pulsation can be excluded from the hipparcos  parallax alone .",
    "the zero point assuming second overtone pulsation is consistent with the zero point obtained for the whole sample , and we will hence assume in our zero point determinations that v473 lyr is indeed a second overtone pulsator .",
    "+ the zero point for the entire sample of @xmath104 compares to the value of fc of @xmath105 , and the value of l99 of @xmath106 ( they used a slightly different slope of @xmath107 ) .",
    "these values are all very similar , and the differences are mainly due to the different samples of cepheids , and to a lesser extent to the slight differences in the adopted photometry .",
    "we believe that the present sample is the most carefully selected sample of the three with respect to completeness , the flagging of overtone pulsators , and the removal of cepheids  that may influence the analysis for various reasons ( double - mode cepheids , unreliable hipparcos  solutions , possible contaminated photometry due to binary companions ) , as explained in the introduction .",
    "a first comment is on the different solution from the fundamental mode and overtone pulsators . in fc",
    "the difference between the solution using the fundamental pulsators or the full sample was only 0.02 mag . in our case",
    "it is about 0.08 .",
    "fc did not present the solution for the overtones only , but we have calculated it from their data ( solution 8) .",
    "the difference using only the overtones or the fundamental pulsators is 0.05 mag in their case . in our case",
    "it is 0.15 mag , which is a difference at the 1@xmath110 level .",
    "this indicates how important it is to carefully flag the overtone pulsators .",
    "l99 derive a zero point of @xmath111 ( after correcting for a bias of @xmath112 mag ) with a very small error of 0.05 , using a selection on @xmath113 .",
    "we confirm ( solutions 14 and 15 ) that the derived zero point is not significantly different from that for the whole sample , but we do not confirm such a small error .",
    "in fact , pont ( 1999 ) argues that the error of 0.10 in fc is even underestimated based on his numerical simulations .",
    "our simulations confirm this ( sect .  7 ) and so it is not clear how l99 arrived at such a small error .      for solutions 16 - 18 only positive parallaxes have been selected to highlight the effect of lk - bias .",
    "the zero points are fainter , as expected .",
    "interestingly enough , the zero point for the overtone pulsators is hardly changed .",
    "only 5 overtones ( 15% ) have negative observed parallaxes and those carry very little weight , while for the fundamental mode pulsators a selection on positive parallaxes reduces the number by 32% .",
    "fcs final choice for the zero point relied heavily on a subsample of 26 stars , selected on weight .",
    "the question arises if this introduces some bias . for solutions 19 - 24 we have made different selections on weight , in particular solutions 19 - 22",
    "have been devised such that each bin selected on individual weight has about the same total weight , so that the errors on the zero point are comparable .",
    "the differences are at the 1@xmath110 level . from numerical simulations performed in sect .",
    "7 ( see table  6 ) we confirm that there are no indications at the present level of accuracy that a selection on weight is an ( indirect ) selection on parallax , and so a sample selected on weight appears not to be subject to lk - bias .",
    "the error on the zero point determination is larger when selecting on ( individual ) weight , simply because of the smaller value of the total weight ( see table  6 ) .",
    "this is different from the result in fc , who quote a _",
    "smaller _ error on the zero point for the sample selected on weight compared to their full sample ( cf .",
    "their solution 6 and 1 ) .",
    "solutions 25 - 36 represent cases where the sample was split up in bins in @xmath114 carrying approximately equal weight , for the whole sample ( solutions 25 - 28 ) , and the fundamental pulsators only ( solutions 29 - 32 , and 33 - 36 for a slope of @xmath115 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the star with the highest individual weight was excluded in defining the bins .",
    "there is a significant dependence of the zero point on @xmath114 .",
    "this is particularly clear in the case of the fundamental mode pulsators where the zero point for stars with @xmath116 differs at the 3@xmath110 level from the shortest period bin .    to expand on this matter further",
    ", we show in fig .  4 how 10@xmath117 depends on @xmath114 for the full sample ( top panel ) , and for the 47 stars with an individual weight @xmath118 .",
    "shown are the weighted - mean values of 10@xmath46 ( solid lines ) , and weighted least - square fits to the data of the form 10@xmath119 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the ( @xmath120 ) found are ( 0.11 @xmath7 0.12 , 0.44 @xmath121 0.10 ) for the full sample , and ( 0.094 @xmath7 0.115 , 0.43 @xmath121 0.09 ) for the 47 stars .",
    "the analysis was repeated for the fundamental mode pulsators only , giving samples of 204 and 35 stars , respectively .",
    "the ( @xmath120 ) found are ( 0.17 @xmath7 0.15 , 0.35 @xmath121 0.14 ) for the full sample , and ( 0.17 @xmath7 0.15 , 0.34 @xmath121 0.14 ) for the stars with weight @xmath118 .",
    "the slopes derived are significant at the 1@xmath110 level only .",
    "+ these results depend on the adopted slope in the @xmath4-relation . for a slope @xmath122",
    "we find that the effect of the dependence of the zero point on the binning in @xmath114 is enhanced , and that the slope in the 10@xmath46 versus @xmath114 relation becomes significant at the 2@xmath110 level .",
    "we also calculated the results for a slope of @xmath123 ( bono et al .",
    "the results are listed as solutions 33 - 36 for the fundamental pulsators .",
    "the dependence on period is not significant in this case , although the shortest bin remains the brightest .",
    "least - square fits give the following results for ( @xmath120 ) : all stars ( @xmath124 0.090 , 0.45 @xmath7 0.08 ) , 56 stars with weight @xmath118 ( @xmath125 0.099 , 0.45 @xmath7 0.08 ) , all fundamental pulsators ( 0.00 @xmath7 0.11 , 0.39 @xmath7 0.11 ) , 42 fundamental pulsators with weight @xmath118 ( 0.00 @xmath7 0.13 , 0.38 @xmath7 0.12 ) .",
    "the slope derived is no longer significant . from this analysis",
    "one may conclude that there is weak evidence for the fact that the slope in the @xmath95-relation is shallower than in the lmc , or , alternatively that there is a change of slope at the short period end .",
    "a similar effect is found for the @xmath126-relation ( see next section ) .",
    "the implications are discussed further in sect .",

    "<S> we stress the importance of two systematic effects which influence the distance to the lmc : the slopes of the galactic @xmath4-relations and metallicity corrections . in order to assess the influence of these various effects , we present 27 distance moduli ( dm ) to the lmc . </S>",
    "<S> these are based on three different colours ( @xmath6 ) , three different slopes ( the slope observed for cepheids  in the lmc , a shallower slope predicted from one set of theoretical models , and a steeper slope as derived for galactic cepheids  from the surface - brightness technique ) , and three different metallicity corrections ( no correction as predicted by one set of theoretical models , one implying larger dm as predicted by another set of theoretical models , and one implying shorter dm based on empirical evidence ) . </S>",

    "<S> this would eliminate the possible bias due to the limited number of stars , and would reduce the random error estimate from 0.18 to about 0.10 mag . </S>",
