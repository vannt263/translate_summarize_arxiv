    "[ sec : plant - model - control ]    let us consider the following discrete - time , lti plant model with a scalar input : @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is reachable .",
    "we are interested in a networked control architecture where the controller communicates with the plant actuator through an erasure channel , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ncs ] .",
    "this channel introduces bounded packet - dropouts . in packetized predictive control ( ppc ) , as described , e.g. , in @xcite at each time instant @xmath6 , the controller uses the state @xmath7 of the plant to calculate and send a control packet of the form @xmath8^{\\top}\\in{{\\mathbb{r}}}^n\\ ] ] to the plant input node .    to achieve robustness against packet dropouts ,",
    "buffering is used . to be more specific ,",
    "suppose that at time instant @xmath6 the data packet @xmath9 defined in is successfully received at the plant input side .",
    "then , this packet is stored in a buffer , overwriting its previous contents .",
    "if the next packet , @xmath10 , is dropped , then the plant input @xmath11 is set to @xmath12 , the second element of @xmath9 .",
    "the subsequent elements of @xmath9 are then successively used until some control packet @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is successfully received , i.e. , no dropout occurs .",
    "in the ppc method discussed above , control packets @xmath9 are transmitted at each time @xmath4 through an erasure channel .",
    "it is often the case that the bandwidth of the channel is limited , and hence one has to compress control packets to a smaller data size . to achieve an efficient compression of packets ,",
    "we adopt a technique developed in _ compressed sensing _ @xcite that considers the _ sparsity _ of a signal ( or a vector ) .",
    "a sparse vector contains many @xmath15-valued elements and can be highly compressed by only coding its few nonzero components .",
    "based on this notion , in @xcite we presented a sparsity - inducing @xmath16 optimization for ppc which gives _ practical _ stability , i.e. , existence of a bounded invariant set . in the present work ,",
    "we embellish the approach of @xcite by showing how to find _ sparse _ control packets @xmath9 ensuring that the networked system with bounded packet dropouts is _ asymptotically stable_. for this , we propose to design the control packets via the following sparsity - promoting optimization : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of the nonzero elements in @xmath19^\\top$ ] and @xmath20 in  ( [ eq : const2 ] ) , @xmath21 is the horizon length , taken here equal to the buffer size .",
    "the matrix @xmath22 is a design parameter which allows one to shape the response of the plant state components ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are chosen such that the feedback system is asymptotically stable , as indicated in theorem  [ thm : stability ] below . to state",
    "our subsequent results , we introduce the matrices @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 by @xmath28    [ thm : stability ] assume that the number of consecutive packet - dropouts is uniformly bounded by @xmath21 .",
    "suppose the matrices @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are chosen by the following procedure :    1 .",
    "choose @xmath22 arbitrarily .",
    "2 .   solve the following riccati equation to obtain @xmath23 : @xmath32 3 .",
    "compute the constants @xmath33 and @xmath34 via @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-th column of matrix @xmath25 .",
    "4 .   choose a matrix @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "5 .   set @xmath40 .",
    "then for any choice of the control vector from the feasible set of the optimization ( which includes the sparsest control packets @xmath9 ) , the networked control system is asymptotically stable , that is , @xmath41 .",
    "the optimization can be rewritten as follows : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . to solve this combinatorial optimization",
    ", we adopt an iterative greedy algorithm called _ orthogonal matching pursuit _ ( omp ) @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is very simple and significantly faster than exhaustive search .",
    "moreover , omp always gives a vector in the feasible set of the optimization , and hence the networked control system will be asymptotically stable by theorem  [ thm : stability ] .",
    "to show the effectiveness of the proposed method , we run 500 simulations with a fixed 4-th order unstable plant ( the poles are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) . the packet size @xmath21 is 10 .",
    "we generate a packet dropout at each time @xmath6 with dropout probability @xmath48 ( if there have been @xmath49 consecutive dropouts , we set the next dropout probability to be @xmath15 , i.e. , the dropout process is markovian ) .",
    "figure [ fig : results ] compares averaged results of the proposed method with that of @xcite .",
    "two plots ( i ) and ( ii ) are displayed for the method of @xcite , with different design parameters for sparsity .",
    "we can see that the omp control exhibits asymptotic ( even exponential ) stability , whereas the @xmath16 method of @xcite is only practically stable .",
    "the @xmath16 method produces much sparser vectors as in ( i ) than the omp formulation , but the system does is not asymptotically stable even if one relaxes the sparsity constraint in the @xmath16 optimization as in ( ii ) .",
    "in fact , it is proved in @xcite that if the controlled plant is unstable , asymptotic stability is impossible by the @xmath16 method .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath16 method amounts to considering a fixed upper bound for the inequality constraint in or instead of time - varying @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to @xmath51-valued control vector when @xmath52 is sufficiently small ( note that @xmath53 is the sparsest vector among all vectors ) .",
