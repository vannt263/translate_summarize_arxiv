    ".    at low energies ( @xmath14  gev in center - of - mass system ) non vacuum exchange can give up to half of total cross sections value in @xmath15 and @xmath16 interactions .",

    "firstly this approach is more correct .",
    "secondly knowledge of quantum non vacuum exchange numbers can be essential for signatures of different processes which take place when passing of nucleus through nucleus .    in present work we will study out which `` color diagrams '' correspond to non vacuum reggeons",
    ". analysis of these color diagrams will show that at low energies baryon number increase in central region of produced particles spectrum . for nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "it means that baryon chemical potential is increased in central region of spectrum .",

    "in what follows we will construct color diagrams for non vacuum reggeons using two results , obtained from consideration of dual diagrams drm .",
    "\\1 . in @xmath40 channel of color diagrams there must exist quark string , which is not divided into several parts .",
    "this string has quarks ( antiquarks ) and diquarks ( antidiquarks ) at its endpoints .",

    "there are no dual diagrams for nucleon - nucleon collisions ( we will consider proton - proton scattering as example ) .",
    "this process is described by so - called twist diagrams , in which scattering of slowed quarks takes place , but not annihilation of quark and antiquark . in the first approximation of drm such diagrams do not contribute to imaginary part of nucleon - nucleon scattering .",
    "so non vacuum regge contributions which are present in meson - nucleon and antinucleon - nucleon interactions must not exist in case of nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "but these contributions are visible in experimental data and parameters of their regge trajectories ( intercepts and slopes ) coincide with regge trajectories parameters of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath39 , @xmath45 collisions .",
    "therefore there must exist a diagram which fulfills requirements of dual diagrams .",

    "3a quarks move forward after scattering , in diagram from fig .",
    "3b they move backward . in order to form one quark string in @xmath40 channel one of protons must be taken in configuration with slowed diquark .",
    "string in @xmath40 channel has quark and diquark at its endpoints",
    ". since this string breaks out into secondary hadrons , then slow state with three quarks also forms colorless state  some baryonic resonance .",
    "thus we can argue that leading non vacuum reggeons in nucleon - nucleon scattering ( proton - proton , proton - neutron and neutron - neutron ) result in translocating of baryons from fragmentation region to central region of secondary hadrons spectrum .",
    "the obtained result means that in nucleus - nucleus scattering at low and intermediate energies baryon number may increase in central region of secondary hadrons spectrum . this may help in discovering quark - gluon plasma effects in facilities nica and fair .",
    "we have come to conclusions by studying structure of color diagrams for non vacuum reggeons .",
    "evidently , further detailed analysis is necessary .",
    "though many important results were obtained only from structure of diagrams in @xmath46 theory . in particular , the first proof of the agk theorem was derived exactly from analysis of ladder diagram structure in @xmath46 .",
