    "nonlinearity is advantageous for observing quantum effects in vibrational systems .",

    "in addition , nonlinearity leads to an interesting behavior of vibrational systems in external periodic fields , including the onset of bistability of forced vibrations .",
    "the interest in quantum effects in modulated nonlinear oscillators significantly increased recently due to the development of high - quality microwave resonators with the anharmonicity provided by josephson junctions and to applications of these systems in quantum information @xcite .",
    "the long - sought @xcite quantum regime has been reached also in nanomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "this development has opened the possibility of measurements of a single quantum nonlinear oscillator rather than of an ensemble of oscillators .",
    "in addition , the systems are versatile and allow accessing different dynamical regimes .",
    "one of the important problems that can be addressed with strongly modulated nonlinear oscillators is quantum fluctuations far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "in addition to the standard quantum uncertainty , such fluctuations come from the coupling of a quantum system to a thermal bath .",
    "the coupling leads to relaxation of the system via emission of excitations in the bath ( photons , phonons , etc ) accompanied by transitions between the system energy levels .",
    "if the coupling is weak , the transition rates are small compared to the transferred energy . in the classical case , the transitions lead to friction .    at the quantum level , however , one should take into account that the transitions happen at random .",
    "the randomness gives rise to a peculiar quantum noise and the related quantum heating of the oscilator .",
    "its important manifestation is quantum activation in driven nonlinear oscillators @xcite , where the noise leads to activation - type transitions between the states of forced vibrations .",
    "quantum activation has been now seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "there is also an observation of the quantum heating in the spectrum of a resonantly driven oscillator .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , no direct measurements of the relaxation - induced distribution over quantum states have been made and no direct means to measure this distribution have been proposed .    in this paper",
    "we show that the distribution over the states of a modulated nonlinear oscillator can be measured spectroscopically .",
    "if the oscillator is strongly underdamped , the power spectrum of its fluctuations and the spectrum of the response to an additional weak field can display a fine structure .",
    "the intensities of the fine - structure lines are directly related to the occupation of the oscillator states , and the line shapes depend on the effective quantum temperature as well as the temperature of the thermal reservoir .",
    "we note that spectroscopy has been long recognized as a means of getting an insight into the dynamics of a strongly driven oscillator and , more recently , of using the oscillator for quantum measurements @xcite . however , the fine structure of the spectra has not been discussed earlier .",

    "classically , as a result of parametric resonance the modulated oscillator can start vibrating at frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the steady vibrational states are determined by the balance between the modulation , the dissipation due to coupling to a thermal bath , and the oscillator nonlinearity @xcite . for not too strong modulation , the oscillator has two vibrational states , which have the same amplitude and differ in phase by @xmath3 .",

    "if these were energy levels , for zero bath temperature @xmath8 the oscillator would be at the lowest level and its power spectrum would have one line that corresponds to the transition to the next level .",
    "however , because of quantum heating the oscillator occupies higher-@xmath7 states in fig .",
    "[ fig : quasienergy ] .",
    "therefore the spectrum has lines that correspond to transitions from these states as well , and the transitions not only up , but also down in @xmath7 .",

    "an interesting feature of the parametrically modulated oscillator , that does not occur in an additively driven oscillator , is the occurrence of the parameter value where the effective temperature of the quasienergy distribution coincides with the temperature of the bath , to the leading order in the distance from the stable state along the quasienergy axis . near bifurcation points where the stable state disappears",
    ", on the other hand , the effective temperature sharply increases .",
    "another important feature is the supernarrow peak at frequency @xmath2 , which emerges in the response @xcite and also in the noise spectrum , where it has been already seen in the experiment @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the supernarrow peak for additively driven oscillators @xcite , for parametric oscillators the peak has large intensity in a broad parameter range , everywhere where the period - two states are significantly populated .",

    ", the quantum - heating induced fine structure should be observable not only in the noise spectrum , but also in the spectrum of linear response to an additional weak field at frequency @xmath310 close to @xmath311 .",
