    "this concept allows one to define both ls paths and hecke paths , as well as to relate hecke paths and foldings of geodesic paths , which is discussed in the next section .",

    "we also find a necessary and sufficient condition for unfolding of a path @xmath13 which is _ local _ , i.e. it depends only on germs of the path @xmath13 at its break - points .",
    "in section [ lspolygons ] we review littelmann s path model for the representation theory of complex semisimple lie groups , in particular we discuss ls paths and generalized ls paths as well as raising and lowering operators .",
    "we use _ approximation of ls paths by paths satisfying the simple chain condition _ to unfold ls paths in @xmath14 , theorem [ lsfolded ] in section [ unfoldingls ] .",
    "although there are hecke paths which are not ls paths , since the unfolding condition is local , by restricting the root system we reduce the general unfolding problem to the case of the ls paths .",
    "we thus establish that a path in @xmath11 is unfoldable in @xmath14 it and only if it is a hecke path , this is done in section [ characterizationsection ] , theorem [ chain - unfolding ] .",
