    "the detection of cosmic ray events with energies above @xmath7 eev ( @xmath8 ) ( efimov et al . 1990 , bird et al .",
    "1995 , hayashida et al .",
    "1994a ) , beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff energy ( greisen 1966 , zatsepin and kuzmin 1966 ) , has posed a challenge for the understanding of their origin and nature .",
    "particles with energies above about @xmath9 eev will loose substantial amounts of energy through interactions with the @xmath10 k cosmic microwave background radiation , so that their sources must be within few tens of mpc ( protheroe and johnson 1995 , sigl , schramm and bhattacharjee 1994 , medina tanco , gouveia dal pino and horvath 1997a ) .",
    "an important clue to their origin can be obtained from the correlation of their arrival direction with astrophysical sources . based on events observed with the haverah park experiment ( watson 1994 ) , stanev et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have suggested that the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) observed in the northern hemisphere show a statistical preference for arrival directions close to the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) . on the other hand , a similar analysis carried out with the events detected by the sugar experiment in the southern hemisphere ( kewley , clay and dawson 1996 ) , and the agasa experiment in japan , support a more uniform distribution through out the sky , although some clustering is suggested by few groups of events in the later case ( hayashida et al .",
    "a major question that then arises about the uhecr , regards their propagation from the sources to the detector through the galactic magnetic field - what is the angular correlation between the arrival directions of the particles and the parent sources after their passage through the galactic magnetic field ?",
    "how much are they deflected in a large scale regular galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) ?    under the assumption that the uhecr are mostly composed of protons , we have examined in a previous work ( medina tanco , gouveia dal pino e horvath 1997a ) the non - diffusive propagation of uhecr through the stochastic intergalactic and an extended galactic halo magnetic fields , and found that the uhecr arriving in the galaxy seem to point to the sources more strongly than previously believed ( within error circles of at most @xmath11 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we address the propagation of the uhecr in the regular large scale galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "stanev ( 1997 ) has recently performed a similar investigation by considering different galactic magnetic field configurations .",
    "searching for a possible correlation with sources in the supergalactic plane ( sgp ) , he plotted the volcano ranch events above @xmath12 ev ( linsley 1963 , egorov 1963 , laurence , reid and watson 1991 , yoshida et al .",
    "1995 ) , after correcting their positions for deflection in the gmf , and found that some groups of events seem to be closer to the sgp after that correction . on the other hand , for a vast region of the sky ( @xmath13 )",
    ", he found that the corrected uhecr positions are further away from the sgp .    in this work",
    ", we go further in this investigation by performing 3 d simulations of proton and fe nuclei trajectories through the gmf and present full - sky maps ( in galactic coordinates ) of their arrival direction distribution in both the detector ( after deflection in the gmf ) and outside the galactic halo ( before deflection in the gmf , where they point to the real source locations ) . also , in order to make the visualization and data analysis easier , we have introduced a cube - based pixelization representation of the events in a similar way to the one employed in the construction of the cobe maps ( chan and oneill 1976 , smoot et al .",
    "1992 , tegmark 1996 ; see below ) . with this technique , the positions of the arrival directions of the yakutsk , fly s eye and akeno uhecr events ( efimov et al 1990 , bird et al .",
    "1995 , hayashida et al .",
    "1994b ) are also plotted at the detector and outside the galactic halo . as we will show below",
    ", the main advantage of this procedure is to allow a direct and transparent identification of the source for a given magnetic field configuration .",
    "we assume an axisymmetric , spiral field without reversals extending to galactocentric distances of 20 kpc in all radial directions , and with an even ( quadrupole type ) parity in the perpendicular direction ( z ) to the galactic plane .",
    "this configuration , so called @xmath14 , is described in detail by stanev ( 1997 ) and is entirely consistent with the observations ( beck et al .",
    "1996 , kronberg 1994 ) .",
    "the field is taken to be @xmath15 at @xmath16 kpc and constant at this value in the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the radial dependence is consistent with field strengths inferred from pulsar rotation measures . as in stanev ( 1995 ) , we assume an exponentially decaying magnetic field with height from the galactic plane .",
    "two scalelengths are adopeted , @xmath17 kpc for @xmath18 kpc and @xmath19 kpc for @xmath20 kpc .",
    "we have also performed some simulations of the uhecr trajectories including the presence of a constant z - component in the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath21 g ) pointing to north in the northern galactic hemisphere and to the opposite direction in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this component was superimposed to the large scale @xmath14 spiral field .",
    "there is some observational support for this component that would be associated to the existence of a galactic wind ( e.g. , stanev 1997 ) .",
    "we first assume that the uhecr are mostly ionized hydrogen atoms ( protons ) of extragalactic origin ( hillas 1984 , rachen and biermann 1993 , stanev et al .",
    "1995 , medina tanco , gouveia dal pino and horvath 1997a ) . in order to trace the particle trajectories through the gmf",
    ", we apply the @xmath22 @xmath23 ( stanev 1997 , flckiger et al .",
    "1991 , bieber , evenson and lin 1992 ) by backtracking antiprotons .",
    "an antiproton injected at the earth in a certain direction will follow the same trajectory than a proton arriving at the same direction at the earth .",
    "assuming an isotropic distribution , we inject antiprotons at different galactic longitude @xmath24 and latitude @xmath25 at the earth , and follow their propagation through the gmf until they exit the galactic halo . in this way , we can determine the particle direction outside the galaxy before its direction can be altered by the gmf .",
    "let us start discussing the lower energies .",
    "1 depicts the results for protons of energy @xmath26 ev propagating through the large scale gmf including the described @xmath2 component . about @xmath27 antiprotons",
    "uniformly distributed were injected at the earth .",
    "their positional orientation at the detector is represented by the points ( or pixels ) in the sky map of fig .",
    "1b , in galactic coordinates .",
    "they fit the arrival directions of the protons @xmath28 their passage through the gmf .",
    "the map is in galactic coordinates .",
    "1a shows the orientation distribution of the same protons at their arrival in the galaxy , before they are deflected in the gmf .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "1a , the events point to the true source locations .",
    "the uhecr positions are distributed in different shades of gray according to their deflection angles due to passage through the gmf .",
    "we find that , except for particles coming from very high latitudes , there is significant deflection of their trajectories .",
    "error boxes larger than or equal to @xmath4 are most expected at these energies .",
    "in fact , only @xmath29 of the particles present deflection angles smaller than @xmath30 in their trajectories through the gmf .",
    "when the constant @xmath2 component is set to zero , we find that the deflection is drastically decreased ( @xmath31 of the particles present deflections smaller than @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "the presence or absence of that `` wind '' magnetic field component is therefore very important to track the trajectories of the primaries inside the galaxy .    for the higher energy protons ( with @xmath35 ev ) , we find a strong reduction in the deflection angles of the particle trajectories in both situations , that is , with or without the inclusion of the @xmath2 component . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath36 of the particles show deflections smaller than @xmath37 , while in the second , more than @xmath38 of the particles are deflected by less than @xmath37 , so that the effect of the gmf on the highest energy particles is never important , as expected .",
    "dramatic changes do occur when heavy particles are considered . in this case",
    ", the uhecr would come from an extended halo ( see , e.g. , hillas 1984 , medina tanco , gouveia dal pino and horvath 1997a ) . applying the same scheme ,",
    "we have calculated the mapping detector - source for fe nuclei at an energy @xmath39 ev for @xmath40 .",
    "2 shows the deflection angle distribution for the fe nuclei . as in fig .",
    "1 , the uhecr positions are distributed in different shades of gray according to their deflection angles due to passage through the gmf .",
    "2a depicts the fe nuclei at the galactic halo border pointing to the source directions ( before deflection ) , and fig .",
    "2b depicts the particle arrival directions at the detector ( after deflection ) .",
    "we find that the large scale magnetic field component causes the arrival direction of the particles to be strongly dependent on the coordinates ( @xmath25 , @xmath24 ) of the particle source .",
    "moreover , about @xmath41 of the particles present deflection angles larger than @xmath42 in their trajectories through the gmf , and this figure increases to @xmath43 in the lower energy case ( see medina tanco , gouveia dal pino and horvath 1997b , for details ) . as a general feature , we see that in some regions , the deflection may be high enough as to make extremely difficult any identification of the sources unless the true magnetic field configuration can be determined .",
    "only the events coming from the galactic anti - center direction show deflections smaller than @xmath44 , in the high energy case , and this correlation is drastically reduced in the smaller energy case . in the particular case of the locations of the observed uhe events of yakutsk , fly s eye , and akeno ( efimov 1990 , bird et al .",
    "1995 , hayashida et al .",
    "1994b ) the deflection is not very large .",
    "finally , we notice from the empty regions at high galactic latitudes in fig .",
    "2a , that some galactic directions are virtually unobservable at the earth , so that not every incoming particle direction will be allowed between source and detector .",
    "the gmf acts as a kind of giant spectral analyser and the forbidden and allowed regions resemble the situation the dipolar magnetic field of the earth creates on the low energy cosmic rays .",
    "although calculated for a particular magnetic field geometry , the results presented here indicate how significant can be the uhecr deflections in the large scale ordered gmf if heavy nuclei are required to be the primaries . as in the stanev work ( 1997 ) , we find that the magnitude of the deflections of the uhecr in the gmf requires their arrival directions to be corrected before they are compared to astrophysical source locations .",
    "moreover , we find that the arrival directions of the incoming particles are strongly dependent on the coordinates of the parent sources . for some directions of the sky , the deflection can be so high that a source identification becomes virtually impossible , unless the true galactic magnetic field configuration can be accurately determined .",
    "this effect is larger for decreasing energy and with the inclusion of a @xmath2 component in the large scale gmf . nonetheless , for the magnetic field geometry assumed here , the observed uhe energy fly s eye , akeno , and yakutsk events , come from a region of the sky for which the deflections in the particle trajectories are not very significant .",
    "an interesting consequence of the results above ( which was also pointed out by stanev 1995 ) regards the strong dependence of the magnitude of an uhecr deflection with the viewing area of a given experiment .",
    "this dependence could lead to shifts between the arrival directions of incoming events detected by different experiments in different viewing areas .",
    "the current number of uhecr events so far detected is not large enough to delineate definite conclusions on their origin or arrival directions .",
    "nonetheless , the auger project ( 1995 ) , which proposes the construction of two air shower arrays in the northern and southern hemispheres in order to provide an all - sky coverage of the events , will not only contribute to improve the statistics of the events , but most important , will probe valuable information on the large scale structure of the galactic magnetic field thus making it possible to trace the particle trajectories and source directions .    finally , we should note that the possible existence of large scale regular extragalactic magnetic field components ( e.g. arp 1988 ) could provoke further non - negligible uhecr deflections in the mpc scales which would , of course , increase the complexity of the picture presented here .",
