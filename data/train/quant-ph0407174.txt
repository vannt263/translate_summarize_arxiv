    "quantum bit string commitment ( qbsc ) was proposed by kent@xcite , as a generalization of bit commitment ( bc ) .",
    "the fundamental goal of qbsc is the same as that of bc ; that is , the sender first sends evidence of assigned data over a communication channel without revealing the actual data .",
    "then , after an interval , the sender reveals the data and the receiver verifies that the data have not been modified .",
    "the difference in qbsc is that the sender commits a string @xmath0 with @xmath1 in a single protocol session , and a limited ( but certain ) number of its bits are accessible by the receiver before the open phase .",
    "this situation is referred to as @xmath2 _ bit string commitment _ in ref.@xcite , where @xmath3 @xmath4 is the maximum number of accessible bits .",
    "conventional bc schemes correspond to the case where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and in this sense qbsc is a generalization of bc .    in this paper , we propose a new qbsc protocol that can be implemented using currently available technology , such as single - photon sources and detectors , and then prove its security .",
    "the main difference from the previous protocol is in the quantum measurement procedure performed by the receiver to verify a commitment . in our scheme",
    ", the receiver is allowed to perform the measurements in the commitment phase using randomized bases , which means that it is not necessary to preserve the quantum state until the open phase .",
    "although qbsc is a generalization of bc , the security level that it achieves is slightly weaker than that of bc unless @xmath6 .",
    "we would like to stress that our proposal is _ not _ intended to break the no - go theorem of lo - chau@xcite and mayers@xcite , which states that if one takes full advantage of quantum computers and quantum communication channels , any type of nonrelativistic bc scheme can be attacked .",
    "our ultimate goal is to devise useful and secure quantum cryptographic schemes that do not rely on bc .",
    "the no - go theorem of bc often makes people think that it might be impossible to create any useful cryptographic protocols based on quantum theory , except quantum key distribution ( qkd ) .",
    "this is mainly because bc is one important building block in a whole list of interesting tools , such as multi - party protocols or zero - knowledge proof , rooted in classical cryptology ( see _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , we are not yet able even to characterize the range of cryptographic tasks for which perfectly secure quantum protocols might possibly exist .",
    "thus , we assume here that there must be distinct security notions that are unique to quantum cryptography , and seek protocols that do not necessarily have a classical counterpart .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : previous_method ] , we briefly review some of the results by kent@xcite , including the basic structure of qbsc and its security criteria .",
    "subsequently , we describe the proposed protocol in section [ sec : proposed_protocol ] and prove its security in section [ sec : security_evaluation ] .",
    "then in section [ sec : implementation ] , we briefly comment on the implementation and finally conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the original qbsc was proposed in ref.@xcite , with two example schemes , called protocol 1 and protocol 2 . before presenting our protocol",
    ", we briefly review the results by kent in this section .",
    "both of the example protocols share a simple basic structure , as follows . throughout this paper",
    ", we will call the sender alice and the receiver bob .",
    "alice and bob proceed as follows .       * commitment phase *    1 .",
    "alice chooses a bit string @xmath7 to be committed to and sends bob the corresponding state @xmath8 .",
    "2 .   bob preserves the received state @xmath8 .    *",
    "open phase *    1 .",
    "alice unveils @xmath9 to bob .",
    "bob verifies @xmath9 by a projective measurement on @xmath8",
    ". if the outcome is consistent with @xmath9 , he accepts the commitment , otherwise he rejects it .",
    "the exact form of the state @xmath8 differs depending on the type of protocol and will be given below .      for bc , there are two security requirements , which are called the concealing and binding conditions@xcite .",
    "similar notions are also used for qbsc , although with somewhat relaxed restrictions@xcite .    * * concealing condition .",
    "* the receiver can access only a limited number of bits in the committed string @xmath9 before the open phase .",
    "+ the number of accessible bits is referred to as @xmath3 in ref.@xcite . *",
    "* binding condition .",
    "* it is unlikely that alice will change the content of her commitment @xmath9 after the commitment phase .",
    "note that for bc schemes , bob is assumed to gain no information whatsoever regarding committed bit @xmath10 until alice unveils it , whereas in qbsc perfect concealment is dispensed with ; bob is allowed to extract a certain but limited amount of information from @xmath9 .",
    "the meaning of the term ` unlikely ' in the definition of the binding condition differs in the two protocols .",
    "this point will be discussed below .    as to the possibility of each player cheating ,",
    "alice cheating puts the binding at risk and bob cheating corresponds to concealment . throughout this paper",
    ", we consider only cases where either one of them is cheating , but not both .",
    "thus , the binding and concealing conditions can be discussed separately .",
    "when considering alice s cheating , we denote the quantum state sent to bob as a density matrix @xmath11 , since in general , alice would be likely to use a randomized strategy or send an entangled state .",
    "note here that whatever strategy alice follows , once she transmits the quantum state to bob , the density matrix @xmath11 is fixed .",
    "honest bob verifies alice s commitment by performing a projective measurement of @xmath11 using an orthonormal basis that includes @xmath8 .",
    "bob then accepts it as a correct commitment of string @xmath9 with the probability @xmath12=\\langle\\psi_a|\\rho|\\psi_a\\rangle\\ .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in protocol 1 , binding is discussed for each bit separately .",
    "let @xmath21 be the probability of bob accepting a revelation of @xmath22 for the @xmath23th bit .",
    "we have @xmath24+\\sin^2[(\\pi+2\\theta)/4]\\ , \\label{eq : kent_protocol1_2}\\ ] ] where the rhs can again be chosen arbitrarily close to 1 by choosing suitable @xmath20 . in general , the smaller @xmath20 is , the stronger the binding becomes ; simultaneously , however , concealing becomes weaker , as can be seen from inequality ( [ eq : kent_protocol1_1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath20 needs to be chosen with this balance in mind .      in protocol 1 , as @xmath3 in ( [ eq : kent_protocol1_2 ] ) is in the same order as @xmath25 , most bits from @xmath9 are accessible by bob , because the amount of data encoded per qubit is rather small .",
    "thus , another protocol at the other extreme with a much higher encoding rate is considered here .",
    "the basic idea here is that instead of using qubits , one encodes @xmath9 into a general @xmath26-dimensional vector space @xmath27 .",

    "a cheating alice might want to postpone her decision by selecting @xmath37 patterns of bit strings @xmath38 in the commitment phase .",
    "then , later in the open phase , she could unveil any desired string among them .",
    "in such a case , the maximum probability of her success is less than @xmath39 if @xmath40 , and is less than @xmath41 if @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown@xcite that if the committed states @xmath8 are chosen to be approximately orthogonal : @xmath43 the above binding condition ( [ eq : def_security1 ] ) is true for @xmath44 .",

    "although this seems impossible at first sight , interestingly , it can in fact be easily achieved by using classical error - correcting codes@xcite .",
    "one example is as follows .",
    "take an error - correcting code @xmath46 with information rate @xmath47 and minimum distance @xmath48 and let @xmath49 .",
    "next choose quantum states @xmath50 corresponding to string @xmath51 as : @xmath52 then , as @xmath53 for @xmath54 , an arbitrarily small @xmath55 can be chosen by defining @xmath8 as @xmath56 .",
    "the protocols described in the previous section are certainly significant , in that they achieve a completely new type of security by using quantum mechanics",
    ". however , it seems almost impossible to implement them using current technology .",
    "there are two main reasons .    1 .",
    "bob needs to preserve the quantum state @xmath8 as it was created by alice , until the open phase .",
    "2 .   in protocol 2 ,",
    "highly entangled states , such as @xmath57 given in ( [ eq : kent_protocol2_2 ] ) , are necessary .",
    "in particular , the first point seems the more difficult to overcome .",
    "thus , we propose a modified version of qbsc that can be implemented , and subsequently prove its security .    in kent s",
    "protocol , bob needs to preserve the quantum state @xmath11 as it was sent from alice in the commitment phase until the open phase .",
    "this is because bob verifies @xmath11 by projective measurements using an orthonormal basis including @xmath58 , after alice has unveiled string @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , we cosider here whether bob can distinguish @xmath11 sufficiently accurately without knowing @xmath9 , because if that is the case , bob does not need to preserve @xmath11 for a long period .    in order to actually do this , we change bob s verification procedure .",
    "that is , bob measures @xmath11 as soon as he receives it using randomly chosen orthogonal bases , and then stores the result until the open phase .",
    "although much less information is obtained in this way than is obtained by directly comparing @xmath11 with @xmath58 , it is enough to detect cheating by alice , as we will show in section [ sec : security_evaluation ] .",
    "first we define the quantum state @xmath8 , which is used as a commitment of the string @xmath9 .      throughout this section",
    ", we assume that string @xmath9 is not necessarily a bit string but is in general a @xmath59-ary string @xmath60 .",
    "if the original data are a bit string , one needs to transform them into a @xmath59-ary string using some appropriate surjective mapping . in this case ,",
    "@xmath9 stands for the data of @xmath61 bits",
    ".    then we fix a @xmath59-ary classical @xmath62 error - correcting code : @xmath63 the sender stretches the string @xmath9 into a @xmath59-ary string @xmath64 of length @xmath65 using this error - correcting code .",
    "the commitment @xmath8 takes the form @xmath66 where each @xmath67 is a @xmath26-dimensional vector .",
    "that is , the sender commits by sending @xmath65 ` particles ' having internal degrees of freedom in a @xmath26-dimensional vector space @xmath68 . each @xmath59-ary value @xmath69",
    "is encoded into this @xmath26-dimensional space of the @xmath70 particle .",
    "we use the same set of @xmath26-dimensional states for each particle and denote them as @xmath71 hence , eqn.([eq : define_psi_a_by_particle ] ) means that the @xmath70 particle has @xmath72 states of ( [ eq : def_particle_state ] ) .",
    "the @xmath59 states of ( [ eq : def_particle_state ] ) are all distinct but do not necessarily form an orthonormal basis .",

    ", he selects correct bases in a probabilistic way , and is therefore able to verify alice s commitment confidently .",

    "the rhs of ( [ eq : thirdterm_estimate ] ) being a constant and @xmath237 being negative , inequality ( [ eq : thirdterm_estimate ] ) can always be satisfied by choosing a large enough @xmath65 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , our protocol can be implemented using currently available technology .",
    "for example , the case of @xmath95 can be realized by single photon sources and detectors .",

    "as one can see from the theory of error - correcting codes , for sufficiently large @xmath65 , there exists a code @xmath64 with the information rate @xmath235 that is virtually equal to 1 .",
    "thus , in this case , a secure protocol can be constructed with @xmath242 , where @xmath3 is the bit number accessible by the receiver before unveiling .",
    "for example , take @xmath243 and @xmath244 , which correspond to @xmath245 .",
    "then , it is guaranteed from the gilbert - vershamov bound ( see ref.@xcite ) that there exists a linear code with @xmath239 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 , for which inequality ( [ eq : thirdterm_estimate ] ) holds . in this case",
    ", @xmath249 is satisfied",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that in real life there are problems with information losses in optical channels and with the detection rate of photon detectors .",
    "consequently , bob might end up rejecting alice s commitment even when an honest alice has sent the correct commitment @xmath8 .",
    "still , we can overcome these problems by modifying steps 3 and 4 of the open phase ( sec.[sec : proposed_protocol_procedure ] ) as follows .",
    "first take an integer parameter @xmath250 , the exact value of which is determined by the noise level of the channel and the detection rate",
    ". then change steps 3 and 4 of the open phase as follows :",
    "bob verifies the following condition for each particle @xmath93  : * if the basis he chooses is correct , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath94 , he obtains @xmath67 as a result of his measurement .",
    "+ then , he records as @xmath251 the number of particles that do _ not _ satisfy the above condition .",
    "2 .   if the above condition does not hold for more than @xmath252 particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath253 , then bob rejects the commitment",
    ". otherwise he accepts it .    in other words , bob accepts alice s commitment even when up to a certain number of particles does not meet the condition of step 3 . in this case too , the security of the protocol can be shown in almost the same way as in the previous section@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a new qbsc protocol and shown that it is secure in terms of the same security requirements as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "our protocol has the merit that it can be implemented using currently available technology such as single - photon sources and detectors .",
    "an example of future work is the optimization of the protocol presented here . as discussed in section [ sec : implementation ] , if the protocol is implemented using bb84-like states , the classical error - correcting code @xmath64 needs to be of the order of @xmath254 in length .",
    "although possible in principle , it is not very practical to calculate a generator matrix of this size using currently available computers . instead , it is much more worthwhile to optimize the protocol or the security proof so that we can ensure the same level of security for smaller @xmath65 .",
    "for example , the estimate given in section [ sec : choice_of_parameters ] is not yet tight , since there we were interested mainly in proving that the protocol is in fact possible .",
    "thus , by using a better strategy , we might be able to obtain more security for shorter bit length @xmath25 .",
    "note , in particular , that even with the ratio @xmath255 of the accessible bits being fixed , there is a variety of choices of parameters , such as @xmath59 , @xmath26 , and @xmath75",
    ". it will be interesting to see how we can better optimize the protocol , whether by making better choices for quantum states @xmath162 or by optimizing the classical error - correcting code @xmath64 .",
