    "the search for single top quark production is one of the major aims of both the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider(lhc ) @xcite , because it can probe the electroweak sector of the standard model(sm ) , in contrast with the dominant qcd pair production mechanism , and provide a consistency check on the measured parameters of the top quark in the qcd pair production process @xcite .",
    "further more , the mass of top quark is comparable to the electroweak(ew ) symmetry breaking scale , and it can play a role of wonderful probe for the ew symmetry breaking mechanism and new physics , especially the minimal supersymmetry standard model(mssm ) as a very popular model beyond the sm , via non - standard couplings @xcite , loop effects @xcite , etc .",
    ", in the processes for single top quark production",
    ".    at the lhc single top quarks are produced primarily via the t - channel @xcite , @xmath3 the quark annihilation process(s - channel ) @xcite , @xmath4 and the associated production process @xcite , @xmath5 which can reliably be predicted in the sm , and their leading order(lo ) results are summarized in table [ treelevelresult ] @xcite .",
    ".the lo results for single top production at the lhc [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as a high - luminosity lhc would run soon and allow accurate measurements of these cross sections with a statistical uncertainty of less than @xmath6 @xcite , at this level of experimental accuracy , calculations of the radiative corrections are necessary to test the predictions of the sm and to investigate loop effects arising from new physics .",
    "the qcd corrections to the total cross sections of the three channels are about @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite . for t - channel , the sm ew corrections are about @xmath9 and the supersymmetric(susy ) ew corrections are a few percent @xcite at the lhc , for s - channel , the combined effects of susy qcd , susy ew and the yukawa couplings can exceed @xmath9 for small @xmath10 but are only a few percent for @xmath11 at the tevatron @xcite , and for the associated production at the lhc , the sm ew and the susy corrections have been calculated and analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "but at the lhc , the susy qcd corrections to the three channels have not been calculated yet . as the associated production process involves the qcd coupling in initial state , obviously",
    ", the susy qcd corrections are significant for this channel . in order to fill in the blanks in the relevant radiative corrections to the channels considered here , in this paper we present the calculations of the susy qcd corrections to the three channels at the cern lhc , mainly concerning the associated production channel , and",

    "<S> we present the calculations of the supersymmetric qcd corrections to the total cross sections for single top production at the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider in the minimal supersymmetric standard model . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that for the s - channel and t - channel , the supersymmetric qcd corrections are at most about @xmath0 , but for the associated production process @xmath1 , the supersymmetric qcd corrections increase the total cross sections significantly , which can reach about @xmath2 for most values of the parameters , and the supersymmetric qcd corrections should be taken into consideration in the future high precision experimental analysis for top physics . </S>"
