    "the factorization theory of monoids has its genesis in understanding the decomposition of the positive natural numbers @xmath1 into prime numbers . in this multiplicative monoid , the fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees that any natural number greater than 1 can be written uniquely ( up to re - ordering ) as a product of prime numbers , and much of the multiplicative structure of @xmath1 is determined by this decomposition into primes .",
    "many of the nice factorization properties enjoyed by @xmath1 very quickly break down when considering other monoids , as they often contain too few primes to decompose every element .",
    "the study of factorizations in general monoids thus focuses on decomposing elements into _ irreducibles _ , which satisfy a weaker condition than primes , and these decompositions are often non - unique .",
    "the concept of a prime element still remains important in understanding the structure of these monoids , since prime elements are irreducibles that appear in every factorization of the elements they divide .    in  @xcite , geroldinger develops the notion of @xmath0-primality ( definition  [ d : omega ] ) , which measures how far a non - unit element is from being prime .",
    "this @xmath0-function assigns to every non - unit element @xmath2 in a monoid , a value @xmath3 with the property that @xmath4 if and only if @xmath2 is prime in the monoid .",
    "thus , understanding the @xmath0-function gives tremendous insight into not only which elements are prime , but also how `` far from prime '' an element is .    in any cancellative , commutative monoid ,",
    "every prime element is irreducible , but not every irreducible element is necessarily prime .",
    "in fact , the existence of non - prime irreducible elements coincides with the existence of non - unique factorizations . as such , much of the initial work in computing @xmath0-primality focused on the irreducible elements  @xcite .",
    "more recently , though , computing @xmath0-values for arbitrary elements has produced interesting algorithms , closed formulae , and asymptotic results  @xcite .    in certain settings ,",
    "the definition of the @xmath0-function becomes rather tractable , and its study can be facilitated using available algorithms in established computer packages .",
    "this makes many research questions on @xmath0-primality accessible to both strong undergraduate students and professional researchers alike .",
    "this paper focuses on providing a review of known results on @xmath0-primality , numerous examples in specific monoids , and a range of open problems .",
    "as these problems are introduced , every effort is made to include relevant background , and all are accessible to advanced undergraduates , thereby serving as potential research problems for reu students or graduate students .",
    "we begin in section  [ s : general ] by providing two equivalent definitions of the @xmath0-function ( definition  [ d : omega ] and proposition  [ p : bullet ] ) , along with some of its basic properties ( proposition  [ p : basicprops ] ) .",
    "several computational examples of @xmath0-values are also worked out in detail for different monoids , and existing results for block monoids ( and more generally for krull monoids ) are also discussed .",
    "we turn our attention in section  [ s : numerical ] to a particular class of monoids , known as _ numerical monoids _ ( definition  [ d : numerical_monoid ] ) .",
    "we review several results on the @xmath0-function for numerical monoids , including an algorithm suitable for computation ( algorithm  [ a : numerical ] ) , a closed form for the @xmath0-function in certain special cases ( theorem  [ t:2genomega ] ) , and a recent periodicity result ( theorem  [ t : quasi ] ) that gives an asymptotic description of the @xmath0-function for any numerical monoid ( corollary  [ c : asymptotics ] ) . once again",
    ", we work out several examples in detail .    even with the numerous results in sections  [ s : general ] and  [ s : numerical ] , many open questions remain .",
    "we conclude this paper with several open problems related to @xmath0-primality in section  [ s : open ] .",
    "this includes questions related to various aspects of numerical monoids ( sections  [ s : newnumerical]-[s : newalgs ] ) , as well as several other classes of monoids that are known to have interesting factorization structures , but for which little is known about @xmath0-primality ( section  [ s : newmonoids ] ) .",
    "in this section , we introduce the @xmath0-primality function and some of its basic properties , focusing on several computational examples in specific monoids .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all monoids are assumed to be commutative , cancellative , and atomic ( i.e. , non - unit elements can be written as a product of finitely many irreducibles ) . in",
    "what follows , let @xmath5 denote the set of non - negative integers , and @xmath1 the set of positive integers .",
    "recall that a non - unit element in a monoid is _ irreducible _ if it can not be written as a product of non - units .",
    "the set @xmath1 under multiplication forms a monoid in which every decomposition of @xmath6 into irreducible elements is unique up to re - ordering .",
    "example  [ e : hilbert ] provides an example of a submonoid of @xmath1 that fails to inherit this property .",
    "[ e : hilbert ] let @xmath7 denote the set of natural numbers congruent to 1 mod 4 .",
    "since @xmath8 , the monoid @xmath9 forms a multiplicative submonoid of the positive integers called the _",
    "hilbert monoid _",
    ", whose algebraic structure has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "the factorization structure of @xmath9 is heavily determined by prime factorization in @xmath5 , since multiplication in @xmath9 coincides with multiplication in @xmath1 .",
    "any positive prime @xmath10 with @xmath11 is irreducible in @xmath9 , and therefore can not be written as a product of two non - unit elements of @xmath9 .",
    "the converse of this , however , does not always hold .",
    "for instance , @xmath12 can be decomposed uniquely in @xmath1 as @xmath13 ; since @xmath14 , there is no factorization for @xmath15 in @xmath9 , and it is therefore irreducible .",
    "in fact , an element @xmath16 is irreducible if and only if either @xmath17 is prime in @xmath1 or @xmath18 for prime integers @xmath19 in @xmath1 .",
    "elements in @xmath9 can always be written as a product of irreducible elements , but these factorizations need not be unique . for example , consider @xmath20 . since @xmath21 , neither lie in @xmath9 , but @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 all lie in @xmath9 and are irreducible by the argument above .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath25 as two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements .    monoids , as algebraic objects , have a single binary operation .",
    "although the set of natural numbers @xmath5 has two binary operations , the monoid in example  [ e : hilbert ] focuses only on the multiplicative operation .",
    "it is natural to consider irreducibles and factorizations in additive submonoids of @xmath5 as well , motivating the following example .",
    "[ e : mcnugget ] let @xmath26 denote the additive submonoid of @xmath5 generated by 6 , 9 and 20 .",

    "an integer @xmath2 lies in @xmath27 if it is possible to purchase @xmath2 chicken mcnuggets using only these pack sizes .",
    "since @xmath27 is an additive monoid , divisibility in @xmath27 does not coincide with the standard notion of divisibility in @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", 6 divides 15 in @xmath27 since @xmath28 and @xmath15 lies in @xmath27 .",
    "the elements @xmath29 , @xmath15 and @xmath30 are irreducible in @xmath27 , since each can not be written as a linear combination of the other two , and every other non - zero element in @xmath27 is reducible by definition .",
    "different factorizations of an element @xmath31 can be viewed as the different ways of purchasing @xmath2 chicken mcnuggets using packs of 6 , 9 and 20 .",
    "for instance , 18 can be factored as @xmath32 and @xmath33 in @xmath27 , and one can purchase 18 chicken mcnuggets by purchasing either 2 packs of 9 mcnuggets or 3 packs of 6 .",
    "nonunique factorizations in monoids are often studied using several invariants , including elasticity , delta sets , and catenary degree , which measure how far an element is from having a unique factorization ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
