    "this paper presents a detailed study of the two - dimensional star formation , kinematics , and ionized gas properties of arp  299 , covering the two individual galaxies of the system and the interface area . at a distance of about 43 mpc ,",
    "arp  299 is one of the nearest interacting , luminous infrared galaxies , and therefore these observations provide high spatial resolution ( about 0.205 kpc arcsec@xmath8 ) and allow us to investigate in detail the structure and physical properties of this galaxy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the observations and data reduction , while the selection of regions under study is described in  3 .",
    "the next sections present a discussion of the results , with special emphasis on the stellar and ionized gas morphology (  [ sec4 ] ) , the internal dust distribution and extinction effects (  [ sec5 ] ) , the extinction estimates using optical and near - ir emission lines (  [ sec54 ] ) , the two dimensional ionization structure (  [ sec6 ] ) , the electron density (  [ electron ] ) , the origin of the liner - like ionization (  [ sec8 ] ) , the star - forming properties (  [ sec9 ] ) , and the kinematics and dynamical mass derivations (  [ sec - kin ] ) . finally ",
    "[ sec11 ] presents a short summary of the main new results .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) of arp  299 was obtained on 2004 january 15 and 17 using integral , a fiber - based integral field system ( arribas et al .",
    "1998 ) connected to the wide - field fiber optic spectrograph ( wyffos ) ( bingham et al . 1994 ) and mounted on the 4.2 m william herschel telescope .",
    "two different integral configurations were used for observing the system ( see pointings in fig .",
    "[ galaxia ] ) .",
    "the fiber bundle with the largest field of view ( fov ) , sb3 , was centered on a position equidistant from the centers of the galaxies and therefore used to map the diffuse , interface region between the two galaxies ( ic  694+ngc  3690 ) that form the arp  299 system , as well as the galaxy external regions at distances of about 4 kpc .",
    "the sb3 bundle consists of 115 fibers each 27 in diameter , covering a rectangular area of 336@xmath2294 on the sky .",
    "in addition 20 fibers , forming a circle of 450 in radius , were used to obtain a spectrum of the sky simultaneously .",
    "the sb2 bundle was used to map each of the two galaxies ( ic  694 and ngc  3690 , eastern and western galaxies , respectively on fig .",
    "[ galaxia ] ) individually .",
    "it consists of 189 fibers each 09 in diameter , covering a rectangular area of 160@xmath2123 on the sky .",
    "in addition 30 fibers , forming a circle of 450 in radius , were used to measure the sky simultaneously .",
    "the spectra were taken using a 600 lines mm@xmath8 grating , with an effective spectral resolution ( fwhm ) of approximately 6.0   and 9.8   for the sb2 and sb3 bundles respectively , and covering the spectral range @xmath214400@xmath227000  .",
    "the total integration time was 3600 s for each pointing with the sb2 bundle , split into three individual exposures of 1200 s each .",
    "the total integration time with the sb3 bundle was 5400 s divided into three individual exposures of 1800 s each .",
    "the seeing conditions were fairly stable during the two periods of observation ( about 07 the first night , when we used the sb2 bundle , and 11 the second night when we used the sb3 bundle ) .",
    "the data reduction consists of three main steps : 1 ) the basic reduction of two dimensional fiber spectra , 2 ) the line fitting , and 3 ) the generation of maps of spectral features ( such as intensity maps and velocity fields ) from the calibrated spectra .",
    "the basic reduction was performed using the iraf environment , and followed the standard procedures applied to spectra obtained with two - dimensional fiber spectrographs ( arribas et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was performed observing the standard star feige  34 with the same instrument configuration and data reduction procedures used on the galaxy . for each spectrum , the total flux ,",
    "the radial velocities and the velocity dispersions ( @xmath23 ) were measured by fitting single gaussian functions to the observed emission line profiles using the dipso package ( howarth & murray 1988 ) . for the generation of the maps ,",
    "a two dimensional interpolation was applied using the free software ida ( garca - lorenzo et al .",
    "the blue and red stellar continuum images were taken as an emission line - free filter centered at @xmath24=4475   and 6525   respectively , and with a rectangular bandwidth of 150  .",
    "the measures on the sb3 maps were done through an aperture of 30 in diameter , while for the sb2 maps the apertures diameter were 10 ( ic  694 ) and 09 ( ngc  3690 , to avoid the overlap between regions ) .",
    "three sample spectra , covering the entire used spectral range , are shown in fig .",
    "[ espectrillos ] .",
    "all the spectra show the strong ( h@xmath25 , [ o iii]@xmath214959 , 5007 , h@xmath1+[nii]@xmath216548 , 6584 , hei@xmath06678 , and [ sii]@xmath216716 , 6731 ) and the weak ( ni@xmath05199 , hei@xmath05876 , [ oi]@xmath216300 , 6364 , and hei@xmath06678 ) emission lines in different ratios , as well as interstellar absorption lines ( nai@xmath215890 , 5896 ) , that will be used to trace the neutral interstellar medium kinematics .",
    "complementary hst multiwavelength images both in continuum and emission lines are also available .",
    "these additional data include the red ( wfpc2-f814w , archive images ) and the near - infrared ( nicmos1-f110 m , nicmos2-f160w and nicmos2-f222 m , from aah00 ) continuum images . these filters are the hst equivalent to the ground - based johnson - cousins system _ i _ , _ j _ , _ h _ and _ k _ respectively ( origlia & leitherer 2000 ) .",
    "images of the ionized gas as traced by the pa@xmath1 ( @xmath26=1.875 @xmath11 m ) light ( nicmos - f190n , from aah00 ) will be used too .",
    "the archival wfpc2 image was calibrated on - the - fly with the best available reference files , while the nicmos images were reduced with routines from the package nicred ( mcleod 1997 ; see details on aah00 ) .",
    "in order to analyze the system we have selected several regions distributed over the individual galaxies , the interface between them and regions external to the galaxies ( fig . [ galaxia ] ) .",
    "the selection includes compact unresolved high - surface brightness knots , star clusters and more diffuse , extended resolved low - surface brightness areas . for ic  694 and ngc  3690 we based our selection on that done by aah00 , that includes the nuclear regions ( a and b1 respectively ) and the most important star - forming regions and bright star clusters . to identify the position of the regions under study in the lower resolution integral maps , a direct comparison of the convolved wfpc2 image with the red continuum image",
    "was performed .",
    "the following sections present the main results obtained for these different regions and discuss their implications separately for the two individual galaxies , ic  694 and ngc  3690 , and for the interface region between them .",
    "the physical properties measured for each individual region are presented in tables 1 to 3 .",
    "arp  299 is the result of a merger between the galaxies ic  694 and ngc  3690 , whose nuclei ( a and b1 respectively , see fig .",
    "[ interfaceinfo ] ) are located about 4.6  kpc apart .",
    "the system shows a morphologically disturbed structure characterized by the presence of compact high - surface knots , and a complex system of filaments and dust lanes , as already indicated by previous studies at several wavelengths ( e.g. gerhz et al .",
    "1983 ; telesco et al . 1985 ; baan et al . 1990 ; aah00 ) . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the differences in the spatial distribution of the stellar and ionized gas components .",
    "the two integral / sb3 continuum images of arp  299 , obtained at wavelengths blueward of h@xmath1 and h@xmath25 , reproduce well the overall stellar morphology detected with the hst wfpc2 f814w image ( fig .",
    "[ interfaceinfo ] ) although at a lower spatial resolution ( fiber diameter 27 , scales of @xmath160.5 kpc ) . in spite of that , the interface region between the two galaxies , and the external regions show well defined features such as the bridge to the south of region k5 connecting ngc  3690 and ic  694 , and the elongated emission connecting k1 towards k12 source as part of a tail - like structure located to the sw of ngc  3690 ( see fig .",
    "[ galaxia ] ) .",
    "the general structure of the low surface brightness ionized gas in the interface region , as traced by for example h@xmath1 ( fig . [ interfaceinfo ] ) , is similar to that of the stellar component .",
    "however , several differences exist .",
    "diffuse ionized gas is detected ne of ngc  3690 , associated with the k5 and c@xmath27 knots ; the latter region shows pa@xmath1 emission and sn activity in radio ( neff et al . 2004 ) , and is part of a bridge of ionized material ( see fig .",
    "[ interfaceinfo ] , h@xmath1 map ) to the north of the stellar bridge that connects the two individual galaxies .",
    "the [ o]@xmath05007 emission map presents an elongated structure located towards the south - east of b1 and b2 tracing an area where the ionized gas presents high excitation state ( see  [ ionizinterface ] ) .",
    "however , as showed in the next two sections , the most important morphological variations are associated to the main bodies of the galaxies when observed with the higher angular resolution sb2 bundle .",
    "previous studies have concluded that ic  694 was a spiral galaxy that due to the merging process shows a more disrupted morphology ( e.g. , gerhz et al .",
    "1983 ; standford & wood 1989 ; hibbard & yun 1999 ) . the stellar structure as seen from both the hst and the integral continuum images ( see fig .",
    "[ icinfo ] ) is divided into two main substructures : ( 1 ) the arm ( region centered around a7 ) of about 1.8 kpc in length , that could be one of the original spiral arms disrupted and deformed as a consequence of the merging - process , and ( 2 ) the main body of the galaxy , formed by the dust - enshrouded infrared nucleus a ( aah00 ) , and surrounding regions .",
    "the two structures are well separated ( distances of @xmath161 kpc ) by what seems to be a dust lane , that is clearly visible in the hst near - ir color maps ( aah00 ) .",
    "the effect of the internal extinction is remarkable in the continuum images as the relative surface brightness of the regions , in particular nucleus a and surrounding regions , changes with wavelength ( see fig .",
    "[ icinfo ] and discussion in  [ sec52 ] ) .    the ionized gas distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ icinfo ] ) shows several distinct features worth mentioning .",
    "the nucleus of the galaxy ( a ) appears as a weak optical line emitting source , whereas the regions of high surface brightness are located at different positions ( e.g. , part of the arm and towards east , and regions close to a ) and separated up to 1 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "however , in the near - ir a is the brightest pa@xmath1 and br@xmath28 source ( see aah00 and sugai et al .",
    "1999 , see also  [ sec52 ] ) , indicating that the extinction towards the nucleus is very high ( using pa@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio , a@xmath29=6.1@xmath300.7 ) .",
    "there are regions ( e.g. knot g ) that appear as a faint continuum sources , but that are clearly identified as strong optical line emitters .",
    "in addition to differences in the morphology of the ionized gas ( i.e. excitation conditions ) with respect to that of the continuum , there are also differences in the ionized gas distribution as traced by several lines .",
    "the hydrogen recombination lines and the [ nii]@xmath06584 and [ sii]@xmath216717 , 6731 emission lines show a similar distribution , dominated by the emission from regions located on the arm and towards the east , and in the regions surrounding the nucleus .",
    "however , the shock tracer [ oi]@xmath06300 line is concentrated in region h1 , while the higher excitation line [ oiii]@xmath05007 appears to be brightest in regions a7 and g. these differences in the distribution of the emission line gas are not only due to internal extinction effects , but they also reflect changes in the ionization conditions as a function of location within the galaxy ( see  [ ionizinterface ] ) .",
    "the stellar light distribution as observed with the hst shows an irregular morphology dominated by the emission coming from the high surface brightness region b2 ( identified therefore as the optical nucleus ) , and from region b1 and complex c ) . ]",
    "located at distances of 0.49 and 1.3 kpc from b2 , respectively ( see fig . [ ngcinfo ] ) .",
    "however at near and mid - ir wavelengths the true nucleus of the galaxy ( see discussion in  [ truenucleus ] ) , b1 , becomes the brightest continuum region in ngc  3690 ( see aah00 ; satyapal et al .",
    "this disordered morphology could be the combination of the original spiral structure with young star - forming regions such as the complex c , and regions d3 or c@xmath27 , newly formed as a consequence of the interaction process as suggested by several authors ( e.g. gerhz et al .",
    "1983 ; standford & wood 1989 ; baan & haschick 1990 ; hibbard & yun 1999 ) .    the distribution of the ionized gas ( fig . [ ngcinfo ] ) is simpler than that of ic  694 .",
    "the optical nucleus ( b2 ) appears as an extremely faint line emitter , and the structure of the ionized gas is dominated by two high surface brightness regions separated by 1.8 kpc , nucleus b1 and the complex c ( with the peak located towards c2 ) , as previously founded with near - ir hydrogen recombination lines ( sugai et al .",
    "1999 ; aah00 ) .",
    "the brightest emission line peak is associated to c2 for all lines but the shock tracer [ oi]@xmath06300 . for the latter ,",
    "the nucleus b1 is the brightest emitter , as also observed with the near - ir [ fe ii]@xmath01.64 @xmath11 m line ( aah00 ) . analyzing in detail the secondary emission line peaks associated to b1 and surrounding areas , it is interesting to note that the high excitation [ o iii]@xmath31 emission is dominated by b1 , while the h@xmath1 and h@xmath25 emission peaks are associated to region b16 ( which is located 0.26 kpc southwest of b1 , and identified in the @xmath04475 continuum map ) .",
    "low excitation collisional lines [ n ii]@xmath06584 , [ sii]@xmath216717 , 6731 appear to have secondary peaks in both b1 and b16 .",
    "these changes in the emission line distribution represent changes in the ionization conditions , and most likely in the ionizing source ( agn , young stellar clusters and shocks ) on scales of less than 0.3 kpc .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , part of the complex structure observed in the continuum and emission line light distributions is due to large amounts of dust producing spatially dependent internal extinction effects .",
    "the two dimensional extinction maps of the gas ( figs .",
    "[ ebvinterface ] , [ ebvic ] and [ ebvngc ] ) have been derived using the h@xmath1/h@xmath25 line ratio , a foreground dust screen model , and a mean interstellar extinction law based on that of savage & mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "no correction for the presence of underlying stellar hydrogen absorption lines has been applied .",
    "assuming an equivalent width value of ew@xmath32(h@xmath1 ) = ew@xmath32(h@xmath25 ) @xmath6 2   , the derived extinction could be overestimated by as much as @xmath33e(b - v ) @xmath6 0.6 for regions with extremely faint h@xmath25 emission ( e.g. ew(h@xmath25 ) @xmath34 20   ) .",
    "the values for the visual extinction ( a@xmath29=3.1@xmath2e(b - v ) ) in particular regions are given in tables [ infoarp ] , [ tabic ] , and [ tabngc ] .",
    "the results suggest that the highest extinguished regions are , in general , associated to the nuclei and some particular regions ( like c@xmath27 ) , while the external hii regions are mostly less affected by the presence of dust .",
    "the extinction in the whole area covered by the sb3 bundle on scales of about 30 ( i.e. 0.6 kpc ) , is relatively uniform ( see fig .",
    "[ ebvinterface ] ) .",
    "it has an average value of a@xmath29 = 1.9 mag on the selected individual regions , and ranges from a@xmath29(k2 ) = 0.9@xmath300.7 mag to a@xmath29(k5 ) = 2.9@xmath300.7 mag ( see table [ infoarp ] for specific values on all the individual regions ) .      on scales of about 10 ( i.e. 0.21 kpc ) , the internal extinction in the visual covers a wide range of values from about a@xmath29=0.6@xmath300.5 mag in the southwestern section of the galaxy to a@xmath29=3.4@xmath300.5 mag in region h2 , close to the nucleus a ( see table [ tabic ] for specific values , and fig .",
    "[ ebvic ] for the two dimensional e(b - v ) distribution ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ ebvic ] , the h@xmath1 extinction corrected light distribution shows an overall structure similar to that of the pa@xmath1 line except for the region associated with the peak of the emission . while the nucleus a , identified as the brightest near - infrared source in the hst images ( fig .",
    "[ ebvic ] , see also aah00 ) , is also the dominant pa@xmath1 line emitter , the peak of the extinction corrected h@xmath1 distribution is located in regions h1 and h2 , 0.3 and 0.5 kpc towards the east of the nucleus .",
    "also region f , located 1.58 kpc to the south - east of a , appears as a strongly absorbed region ( a@xmath29=3.2@xmath300.5 mag ) , and as a strong h@xmath1 emitter after correcting for extinction .",
    "additional secondary h@xmath1 sources are mostly associated with star - forming regions ( the arm , a region towards the west of a ) at distances of 1 to 1.6 kpc from the nucleus , and delineating what seems to be a spiral - like arm structure previously identified in the pa@xmath1 emission line map .",
    "this galaxy presents the widest range of extinction ( derived from the h@xmath1/h@xmath25 ratio ) for the entire arp  299 system with values that for the individual regions range from a@xmath29(c4)=0.5@xmath300.5 mag to a@xmath29(b2)=3.9@xmath300.6 mag ( see table [ tabngc ] ) .",
    "also , the nucleus b1 in this galaxy is the region of the arp  299 system which has associated the highest h@xmath1/h@xmath25-based extinction , a@xmath354.6 mag ( fig . [ ebvngc ] ) .",
    "the overall structure of the extinction corrected h@xmath1 line distribution agrees well with that of the pa@xmath1 line ( fig .",
    "[ ebvngc ] , see also aah00 ) not only on the high surface brightness regions such as the nucleus b1 and c1 , but also on the low surface brightness region , including b2 identified as the optical nucleus .",
    "additional line ratios involving ir hydrogen recombination lines ( e.g. , pa@xmath1/h@xmath1 , br@xmath28/pa@xmath1 , and pa@xmath1/pa@xmath25 ) , can provide better estimates of the internal extinction in highly extinguished regions as those identified in arp  299 ( see table [ palfatable ] ) .    the pa@xmath1 image of the individual galaxies ( see figs .",
    "[ ebvic ] , [ ebvngc ] , and aah00 ) has been used for measuring all the regions under study with apertures of 10 for ic  694 and of 09 for ngc  3690 to match our ground - based apertures ; the integral h@xmath1 fluxes are given in tables [ tabic ] and [ tabngc ] .",
    "in most regions extinction estimates based on only optical and optical+infrared lines agree within the uncertainties ( table [ palfatable ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are two regions , the nucleus of ic  694 ( a ) and c@xmath27 , where the use of the optical+infrared lines indicates a larger extinction than using only the optical lines , i.e. a@xmath29(pa@xmath1/h@xmath1)@xmath162@xmath2a@xmath29(h@xmath1/h@xmath25 ) .",
    "this means that the extinctions derived using the h@xmath1/h@xmath25 ratio are in general consistent with the ones derived using the pa@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio , except in highly absorbed regions , where there is an underestimate when only the optical lines are used .",
    "these extinctions are similar with those measured in the m51 nuclear hii regions ( calzetti et al .",
    "2005 ) , and in other lirgs ( alonso - herrero et al . 2006 )",
    "using the same near - ir / optical emission lines .",
    "the ionization level for the individual regions identified in arp  299 has been derived using standard optical emission line diagnostic diagrams ( bpt diagrams : baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "hii - like ionization ( i.e. star formation ) is present on the majority of the regions of the individual galaxies , except for nucleus b1 which clearly has seyfert - like ( i.e. presence of an agn ) state .",
    "liner - like ionization is mainly present on the interface ( fig .",
    "[ clasicos ] ; see also tables 1 , 2 , and 3 for specific values of the emission line ratios ) .",
    "several regions show changes in the classification depending on the specific diagram used ; these variations have been interpreted as a consequence of changes in the dominant ionizing mechanism from photoionization to shocks ( e.g. monreal - ibero et al 2006 and references therein ) . in particular , the [ oiii]@xmath05007/h@xmath25-[oi]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 line ratio is more sensitive , and therefore a more reliable tracer , to changes in the ionization conditions due to fast shocks than any of the other optical emission line ratios involving [ n ii]@xmath06584/h@xmath1 or [ sii]@xmath06725/h@xmath1 ratios ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) . in the following subsections a more detailed discussion of the two - dimensional ionization structure of the ionized gas distribution based on the [ oiii]@xmath05007/h@xmath25-[o i]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 diagram and on the [ o iii]@xmath05007/h@xmath25 , and [ oi]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 maps for the interface , ic  694 , and ngc  3690 is given .",

    "[ diaginterface ] ) .",
    "although these data include the high surface brightness nuclear regions of ic  694 and ngc  3690 , and their external regions , they also cover the area that has been identified as the interface zone , i.e. the extended low surface brightness region connecting the two galaxies up to distances of about 4 kpc from their nuclei .",
    "changes in the ionization structure traced by the [ oiii]@xmath05007/h@xmath25 and [ oi]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 two dimensional spatial distribution line ratios are also shown ( fig .",
    "[ diaginterface ] ) .",
    "three different types of ionization , hii- , liner- and seyfert - like , are identified , and the line ratio maps clearly show that the ionization structure has a well defined spatial distribution .",
    "the majority of the regions associated with the two individual galaxies ( marked with two iso - contours in the figure ) are dominated by hii - like ionization , as expected from the intense star formation taking place there ( see more details in  [ sec9 ] ) .",
    "there are some exceptions ; the nucleus b1 shows liner - like activity at this angular resolution .",
    "the seyfert - like ionization is clearly resolved with a size of about 7  ( @xmath61.5 kpc ) and has a conical morphology , with an opening angle of about 54@xmath36 and its apex located in nucleus b1 ( at a projected distance of about 1.5 kpc from the peak of the nebula ) within the angular resolution ( see fig.[diaginterface ] ) . moreover",
    ", this highly ionized gas is not associated to any particular concentration of stellar mass according to the optical ( wfpc2/f814w ; see fig .",

    "off - nuclear seyfert - like nebulae at distances of few kpc from the nucleus have already been reported in other ( u)lirgs with seyfert nucleus ( mrk  273 : colina et al .",
    "1999 ) , and interpreted as photoionization of extranuclear interstellar gas by the agn . therefore , our data strongly suggest photoionization by a radiation cone escaping from a central dust - enshrouded agn source located in b1",
    ". the highly ionized conical structure in arp  299 ( ngc  3690 ) is also detected at distances of up to 4 kpc from b1 ; however , the ionization associated to these outer regions of the cone is liner - like rather than seyfert ( fig . [ diaginterface ] ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that within the cone there are two ionization regimes well separated spatially . at projected distances from b1 smaller than about 2",
    "kpc the ionization is likely due to radiation coming from the agn located in b1 , while at larger distances liner - like ionization is dominant .",
    "this liner - like ionization is also found in other areas of the interface region , however with a lower degree of excitation , as traced by the [ o i]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 ratio measured in these regions .      over the area covered by the integral sb2 bundle ,",

    "this is the inner section of the agn - like ionization cone detected with the sb3 bundle , with its apex coincident with b1 .",
    "moreover , the region b2 presents also a high ionization state in the border line of seyfert / liner , characteristic that could indicate the presence of the counter ionization cone .",
    "the detection of seyfert - like activity based on optical emission lines represent the first evidence in the optical for the presence of an agn in b1 , and supports the recent claim of an agn based on x - ray ( della ceca et al . 2002 ) and mid - ir ( gallais et al . 2004 ) data .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies in the optical ( gehrz et al .",
    "1983 ; coziol et al . 1998 ; keel 1984 ) did not find agn emission , probably due to the large size of the slits ( 36 , 25 , and 80 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with our results , where the seyfert nature of the b1 nucleus has been diluted in the sb3 ( = 27 ) spectra , whereas in the higher spatial resolution sb2 ( = 09 ) spectra the classification is clear .",
    "hii - like ionization dominates the rest of the main body of the galaxy ( e.g. complex c ) , while liner - like is present in a few outer regions .",
    "the [ oi]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 map has its peak displaced about 07 ( 0.14 kpc ) to the north with respect to b1 .",
    "similar displacements are observed in the [ nii]@xmath06584/h@xmath1 and in the [ s ii]@xmath06725/h@xmath1 maps .",
    "these lines and in particular [ o i]@xmath06300/h@xmath1 are a good tracers of shocks , thus these shifts may indicate different ionization mechanisms around b1 on scales of 200 pc .",
    "these small scale ionization changes need further investigation with high angular resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the two - dimensional electron density maps of the ionized gas distribution have been derived for the entire arp  299 system using the standard [ s]@xmath06716/[s]@xmath06731 lines ratio ( aller 1984 ; osterbrock 1989 ) . the average line ratio for the interface and the individual galaxies show a similar value , about 1.3@xmath300.1 , indicating an average uniform electron density ( @xmath6100 @xmath37 ) over the entire arp  299 system .",
    "however , the ionization cone detected in ngc  3690 presents a well defined gradient of this line ratio value , that roughly ranges from 1.2@xmath300.15 in the higher excitation ( i.e. seyfert - like ) center of the cone , to 1.8@xmath300.15 in the lower excitation ( i.e. liner - like ) outer section .",
    "thus , the electron density seems to decrease from about 180 @xmath37 at a distance of 1.5 kpc from b1 to less than 10 @xmath37 at about 4 kpc .",

    "the velocity dispersion is clustered around log@xmath23@xmath62 , and there is a large fraction of regions with h - like ionization .    clearly the present data show a different behavior than that found in ulirgs ( monreal - ibero et al .",
    "2006 ) , and this is probably due to the fact that on each case the measurements are done over regions located at different distances to the nucleus , and with different characteristics .",
    "the original correlation was derived for diffuse extra - nuclear regions in ulirgs , which are located at distances of about 5@xmath2215 kpc from the nucleus of the galaxy . in the present case the interface region and the ionization cone",
    "have regions at distances of up to 4 kpc from the nucleus , and comparing with the original limits of the correlation ( see shaded area on fig . [ correlacion ] , _ left panel _ ) the data of the interface and both regions of the ionization cone lie in general above the ratio ,",
    "i.e. this regions show higher excitation for the same velocity dispersion . in the case of the individual galaxies",
    "observed with the actual higher resolution bundle ( fig .",
    "[ correlacion ] , _ center and right panels _ ) the present data are closer to the nucleus than in the case of ulirgs ( up to @xmath62.5 kpc ) and in most cases the regions involved are compact bright sources rather than diffuse . comparing with the original limits of the relation ( see shaded area on fig .",
    "[ correlacion ] , _ center and right panels _ ) the ic  694 data are clustered around , while the ones of ngc  3690 are below the correlation .",
    "this means that in the present case for the individual galaxies the star formation influence is still present , and that the velocity dispersion close to the nucleus traces mass rather than flows / shocks .",
    "given an ionization mechanism , the ionization state of the surrounding gas can be changed as a result of the variations in the electron density , that affect to the ionization parameter ( _ _ u__@xmath39n@xmath40@xmath8r@xmath41 ) .",
    "this appears to be the case in the outer high excitation cone associated to ngc 3690 .",
    "as already mentioned , the electron density seems to have a radial variation within the cone , and by having the exact variation of n@xmath40 with r , the radial dependence of the parameter _",
    "u _ would be described more precisely .",
    "unfortunately in the present case the exact radial dependence of n@xmath40 can not be derived ; in spite of that , the variation detected on the electron density , and therefore the liner activity could be accounted for by the influence of an agn ( if n@xmath40 @xmath39 r@xmath42 ) .",
    "the variation of n@xmath40 implies a variation on the ionization parameter ( _ u _",
    "@xmath39 r@xmath43 ) , and thus the low excitation is valid if the source is not local .    in conclusion ,",
    "for the arp  299 system studied here there are no clear evidences for tidally induced shocks as found in ulirgs .",
    "therefore , the origin for the liner ionization is unclear , and at least in some zones ( i.e. outer parts of the cone ) it could , perhaps , be due to a radiation field similar to that of a low - luminosity agn .",
    "it is well known that merging processes between gas rich galaxies can trigger star formation . as predicted by numerical simulations ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) , the process can vary depending on whether or not the parent disk galaxies have a bulge .",
    "the star - forming process at a low level ( sfr@xmath620 m@xmath14 yr@xmath8 ) consequence of the merging of two disk galaxies without a bulge is produced early on in the merging phase , and can be sustained for about 150 myr . on the other hand , in the merger of galaxies with a bulge the starburst ( sfr @xmath6 50@xmath22100 m@xmath14 yr@xmath8 )",

    ", the age of the burst , and the stellar mass for each individual region can be derived . for the present analysis we use the integral sb2 bundle with a resolution of 09 ( i.e. 0.18 kpc ) ,",
    "thus in the majority of cases the data include both the contribution from the stellar clusters and from a diffuse component .",
    "the aperture photometry as derived by aah00 , using the hst nic1 f110 m , nic2 f160w , nic2 f222 m images is used in the following analysis .",

    "the apertures used were 09 diameter for the nuclei of ic  694 and ngc  3690 a and b1 , and for the star - forming region b2 , and 05 diameter for the rest of the star - forming regions .",
    "the hst magnitudes and colors derived are shown in table [ magtable ] .",

    "regarding to the nucleus b1 , and as previously indicated , it is classified as seyfert , and the fraction of the ionizing flux coming from the buried agn in this region is not well determined .",

    "the galaxy ngc  3690 shows an average age for the individual regions of @xmath65.5@xmath210@xmath3 years , with the eldest one ( 7.2@xmath210@xmath3 years ) located towards the north of b2 .",

    "] , c1 ) the colors measured ( and corrected by extinction ) are very red . as already mentioned ( and discussed by aah00 ) one of the most plausible explanations for this color excess is the presence of hot dust ( t@xmath38600 k ) , which would mainly affect the f160w - f222 m color . in an attempt to take into account the contribution of the hot dust emission ,",
    "the @xmath46@xmath47b@xmath48 wavelength modified black - body thermal emission ( hildebrand 1983 ) has been used .",
    "the results demonstrate that depending on the temperature ( which has not necessary to be homogeneous over the line of sight ) and the amount of dust , the contribution of hot dust ( @xmath6800 k ) emission could represent , on average , about 80% of the k - band emission ( fig .",
    "[ genevamodels1 ] , _ right panel _ ) for the highly extincted regions ( a , b1 , c1 ) , and about 30% for the rest of the regions .",
    "this result supports our previous conclusion that the dust is more concentrated towards the nuclei and some particular regions , than in the extra - nuclear star forming regions .",
    "an alternative to the presence of a hot dust emission is that the structure of the dust - gas distribution does not follow the simple screen geometry , but it is closer to a clumpy foreground or a mixed dust - star distribution . assuming a model where the gas is homogeneously mixed with the stars , the effect of an a@xmath29=6 mag over the f160w - f222 m and f110m - f160w measured colors will produce bluer colors : about 0.3 and 0.4 mag respectively ( scoville et al .",

    "thus the colors modeled with this alternative dust geometry would imply that a hot dust contribution is not mandatory in the external less extincted regions , but it is still required to explain the color excess , in the highly extincted regions ( a , b1 and c1 ) .    the stellar mass of the young population has been measured using two different indicators , the h@xmath1 luminosity and the m@xmath49 absolute magnitude , and comparing with the predicted values for the ages derived using the ew(h@xmath1 ) . in both cases",
    "the h@xmath1/h@xmath25 ratio has been used for correct by extinction ( for a and c@xmath27 the pa@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio was used too ) .",

    "the masses of the young h@xmath1-emitting regions identified in arp  299 are within the range of masses founded in lirgs ( 3@xmath210@xmath3 - 10@xmath51m@xmath14 , scoville et al .",

    "when comparing the stellar masses derived with the h@xmath1 luminosity with the mass obtained from the absolute f160w magnitude , there is a good agreement in the nucleus a , but for the rest of the regions there are differences from a factor @xmath61 to 5 .",
    "one of the main reasons for this difference is that in the majority of the cases ( except a and b2 ) an aperture of 05 has been used for the hst cluster photometry , instead the 09 or 10 used for the integral data analysis ( for the ew(h@xmath1 ) and l(h@xmath1 ) estimates ) ; this difference can lead to offsets of a factor 3 in the mass estimates .",
    "factoring in the aperture effects , the two methods give the same mean value within a factor 2 .",
    "the derived ages of the young h@xmath1-emitting star - forming regions cover a range of between 3@xmath210@xmath3 years to at least 7 - 8@xmath210@xmath3 years old .",
    "this is consistent with the methodology used here : since the h@xmath1 traces preferentially the massive young ionizing stellar clusters , population older than 10 myr is difficult to be detected as h@xmath1 decreases . in any case",
    "there is further evidence that the star formation in arp  299 has persisted for at least the last 10 - 15@xmath210@xmath3 years ( aah00 ) , with high activity on the star - forming regions .",
    "on the basis of this dispersion , we consider that the overall star formation of arp  299 can be modeled by a continuous star formation . under this premise the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the ir luminosity contribution can be derived from the extinction corrected h@xmath1 luminosity , using kennicutt ( 1998 ) expressions , valid for a salpeter imf with mass cutoffs of 0.1 - 100 m@xmath14 :    @xmath52    @xmath53    that strictly speaking are only valid for starbursts with ages less than 10@xmath51 years .    without taking into account the nucleus b1 ( agn candidate ) ,",
    "the sfr of the entire system is about 43 m@xmath4 year@xmath8 , and the l@xmath12 is 9.5@xmath210@xmath54 erg s@xmath8 , whereas the luminosity derived from the iras fluxes is 2.2@xmath210@xmath55 erg s@xmath8 , thus the contribution of the studied regions to the ir luminosity is about 45% .",
    "there is a lack of about 55% in luminosity , that can be accounted for by the agn located in b1 .",
    "previous estimates based on the mid and far - ir spectra of arp  299 assign a 20% of the l@xmath12 coming from b1 and b2 ( charmandaris et al .",

    "so even considering that the majority of this contribution comes from b1 , there is still a lack of about 25@xmath2235% .",

    "the velocity dispersion shows distinct features over the entire area ; there are large differences in @xmath23 , that allow us to discriminate spatially between quiet and turbulent gas with macroscopic motions ( fig .",
    "[ kinematinterface ] _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the so - called interface has an average @xmath23 value of 45 km s@xmath8 that traces no turbulent gas .",
    "the low velocity amplitude and velocity dispersion of the interface indicates that the ionized gas could be in a close to quiescent phase or slowly rotating .",
    "larger @xmath23 values are measured on the previously defined ionization cone , with the maximum ( 160@xmath3021 km s@xmath8 ) located on the peak of seyfert - like ionization .",
    "this spatial coincidence could indicate that in that area the two contributions of the biconic surface of the cone are added , and thus the line measured is wider ( heckman et al . 1990 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum velocity dispersion would imply that the largest macroscopic motions , with approaching velocities , are taking place in that highly ionized area .",
    "the velocity field of both the ionized and neutral gas presents a similar structure ( fig . [ kinematic694 ] _ left and center panels _ ) , when observed with the sb2 bundle .",
    "it has an irregular structure , with the largest receding velocities associated with region i ( 3181@xmath3027 km s@xmath8 for the ionized gas and 3155@xmath3034 km s@xmath8 for the neutral ) , located at 0.42 kpc sw from the nucleus ( a ) .",
    "these maps show a general trend with velocities changing from nw ( receding ) to se ( approaching ) , in agreement with the pattern found with the sb3 data in this region .",
    "the systemic velocity for the ionized gas is defined as the velocity associated with the nucleus ( region a ) , and it has a value of 3121@xmath3027 km  s@xmath8 , consistent with zhao et al .",
    "( 1997 ) estimate based on the h92@xmath1 radio recombination line ( 3120@xmath3050  km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the ionized gas velocity field has a peak - to - peak variation of 290 km  s@xmath8 .",
    "the neutral gas systemic velocity is 3057@xmath3034 km s@xmath8 , and the peak - to - peak velocity is about 216 km s@xmath8 .",
    "although evident structural similarities are found between the ionized and neutral gas ( i.e. same kinematics ) , in general the velocity of the neutral gas presents a blueshift over the entire area with respect to the ionized gas ( about -30@xmath3012 km s@xmath8 over the studied regions ) .",
    "this systematic blueshift appears to be real taking into account the uncertainties . in that case",
    ", this is a marginal effect , with a lower value than the ones measured in ulirgs using a slit ( martin 2006 ; from about -60 km s@xmath8 to -300 km s@xmath8 ) . in the present analysis",
    "the value obtained is derived from ifs data , i.e. has the advantage of the two dimensional distribution versus the use of the slit , where the measurements are limited to a restricted area , probably centered on the nuclear regions .",
    "across the galaxy there are gradients of about 110 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 in the ionized gas velocity ( between regions located @xmath62.3 kpc apart i.e. @xmath611 ) , higher than the typical values founded in ulirgs ( up to 60 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 for an individual galaxy , martin 2006 ) when using a slit of 20 long . in closer regions with large velocity variations",
    "the gradients can be 150 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 ( between regions i and northern of g , located about 1.4 kpc apart ) . in spite of these gradients , and as discussed below , there are no clear evidence for virialized simple rotating motions .",
    "the two - dimensional velocity dispersion map shows a different structure than the velocity field ( fig .",
    "[ kinematic694 ] , _ right panel _ ) . for nucleus",
    "a , the @xmath23 value is 108@xmath3011 km s@xmath8 , in well agreement with the derivation of shier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) based on the co(2,0 ) near - infrared band at 2.3 @xmath11 m ( 135@xmath3021 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the maximum value for @xmath23 ( 170@xmath3020 km s@xmath8 ) is located in a region 0.28 kpc towards the north - east of a , where the [ o ] @xmath06300 emission peak is also located . since [ o ]",
    "@xmath06300 trace shocks , this high @xmath23 value is a hint of turbulence and shocks .",
    "the lowest velocity dispersion ( lower limit 25@xmath303 km s@xmath8 ) corresponds to the area dominated by hii - like ionization , towards the east of the spiral arm ( e.g. a7 , see  [ ionizic ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the velocity dispersion is likely dominated by the internal kinematics within the stellar clusters , rather than by large regions projected along the line of sight .    in this case",
    "it is not possible to state that there are clear indication of pure rotation , i.e. the photometric peak does not coincide with the velocity dispersion maximum , and neither of them coincide with the possible kinematic center .",
    "the velocity maps show that even if pure rotation does not dominate the galaxy kinematics , rotational movements can be present .      like in the previous case , at a resolution of 0.18 kpc",
    "the structure of the ionized and neutral gas velocity fields obtained with the sb2 bundle are very similar ( fig .",
    "[ kinematngc3690 ] _ left and center panels _ ) .",
    "the largest receding velocities are detected towards the north - east of the field ( c@xmath27 , c6 ) , while the largest approaching velocities are located on b2 and towards the south - west .",
    "the ionized gas systemic velocity is defined as the one of the nucleus b1 , with a value of 3040@xmath3027 km s@xmath8 .",
    "this value coincides with zhao et al .",
    "( 1997 ) measurements using the h92@xmath1 radio recombination line ( 3080@xmath3040 km s@xmath8 ) . for the ionized gas ,",
    "the peak - to - peak velocity is 257 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the systemic velocity measured with the neutral gas is 2976@xmath3032 km s@xmath8 , with a peak - to - peak variation of 217 km s@xmath8 . in both ionized and neutral gas ,",
    "the velocity variations are similar to the ones measured in ic  694 .",
    "as founded in ulirgs ( martin 2006 ) , there is a systemic blueshift of the neutral gas velocity with respect to the ionized gas ( about -24@xmath3013 km s@xmath8 in the studied regions ) . due to its value , lower than the results founded for ulirgs ( from about -60 km s@xmath8 to -300 km s@xmath8 , martin 2006 ) ,",
    "this blueshift is consider as a marginal effect .",
    "across the galaxy there are gradients of about 70 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 in the ionized gas ( between c@xmath27 and d3 ) .",
    "this result is close to the gradients derived for ulirgs using a slit ( up to 60 km s@xmath8 kpc@xmath8 for an individual galaxy , martin 2006 ) .    the two - dimensional structure of the velocity dispersion ranges between 50@xmath305 and 172@xmath3020 km s@xmath8 ( fig . [ kinematngc3690 ] _ right panel _ ) , and present different characteristics than the two dimensional velocity fields .",
    "the nucleus b1 has the maximum velocity dispersion value of the entire system ( 172@xmath3020 km s@xmath8 ) , and regions with high velocity dispersion ( @xmath6160 km s@xmath8 ) are also detected about 1 kpc towards the north and north - west of b1 .",
    "looking at the ionized gas velocity field ,",
    "this secondary peaks of the velocity dispersion are located in regions where there are high velocity variations ( from approaching to receding ) , and thus this @xmath23 would represent a convolution of a large velocity gradient .",
    "although the @xmath23-peak coincides spatially with the nucleus , and then it would be tracing the mass ( large @xmath23 implies that this is the most massive galaxy of the system ) , the presence of an agn in b1 could produce a broadening of the line width .",
    "like in the case of ic  694 there are no clear evidences for ordered rotating motions ; the photometric and velocity dispersion peaks do not coincide with the possible kinematic center . in conclusion , although the pure rotation does not dominate the kinematics of the galaxy , rotational process would be present .",
    "the galaxy ngc  3690 , shows variations on the surface brightness importance of the regions b1 and b2 with wavelength . while in the ultraviolet ( windhorst et al .",
    "2002 ) and in the optical ( this work ) b2 appears brightest than b1 , and therefore has been identified as the nucleus , the reverse is true in the near - ir ( 2.2 @xmath11 m aah00 ) and mid - ir ( gallais et al .",
    "besides , the optical kinematical analysis shows that the @xmath23 peak is located in b1 ( see  [ kinngc ] ) .",
    "this fact along with the high extinction ( a@xmath29=3.7 ) , the hot dust component needed to explain the color excess , and the presence of an agn , lead us to the conclusion that b1 is the true nucleus of the individual galaxy ngc  3690 , as previously discussed by gallais et al .",
    "( 2004 ) with mid - ir spectro - imaging , and concluded by zezas et al .",

    "until now the only mass derivation in this work has been done for the h@xmath1-emitting young star forming regions .",
    "the central ionized gas velocity dispersion is a good tracer of the dynamical mass , thus it can be used as an alternative method for mass derivation .",
    "assuming virialization , the dynamical mass of the nuclei and brightest regions can be derived as :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the half mass radius in pc and @xmath23 is the velocity dispersion in km s@xmath8 . assuming a constant value of 1.75 ( see colina et al .",
    "2005 for a detailed discussion ) , and that the effective radius ( r@xmath59 ) of the light distribution traces the half mass radius in each region , it is possible to infer the total dynamical mass .    in the present treatment",
    "we assume that h@xmath1 is traced by pa@xmath1 , that gives the real size of the emitting regions . in consequence the effective radius of the most important emitting sources",
    "is calculated over the hst pa@xmath1 image ; additional estimates using the f110 m image are done for comparison .",
    "there are some caveats related to the spatial resolution of the different set of data worth mentioning . for this mass estimate",
    "we are dealing with information at different spatial resolutions : on the one hand the velocity dispersion from the integral sb2 bundle data was measured at a 09 ( @xmath6180 pc ) resolution . on the other hand the r@xmath59 over the most relevant arp  299 regions ( i.e. the ones resolved ) was measured using the nicmos1/f110 m image ( 0043/pix , i.e. @xmath69 pc / pix ) and nicmos2/pa@xmath1 image ( 0076/pix , i.e. @xmath616 pc / pix ) .",
    "the typical size of the h regions in lirgs is 200 - 300 pc ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2002 ) , i.e. several times larger than the effective radius of the stellar clusters and about the size of a sb2 fiber . taking this into account",
    ", the clusters will be point sources for integral , and their @xmath23 will be integrated on the fiber .    for nucleus",
    "a we derive a dynamical mass of about 1.2@xmath210@xmath60m@xmath14 ( table [ tablamasic ] ) which is about 5 times smaller than the derivation done by shier et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using the velocity dispersion measured from the 2.3@xmath11 m co band ; this discrepancy is due to a different estimate of the radius ( r@xmath61/r@xmath62@xmath164 ) .",
    "the calculated m@xmath63 implies that the young stellar mass content derived from l(h@xmath1 ) in a is about 40% .",
    "the mean value for the dynamical mass of nucleus b1 is 1.5@xmath210@xmath60m@xmath14 ( in good agreement with shier et al .",
    "1996 ) , consequently the upper limit for the young stellar mass content is about 15% . for b2 the mean value of the total mass is 0.6@xmath210@xmath60m@xmath14 ( the same as shier et al .",
    "this would imply that about 100% of the mass in b2 is from young stellar population , indicating that the mass derivation done using l(h@xmath1 ) is probably overestimated . for the last two regions ( c1 and c@xmath27 ) , the r@xmath59 gives an upper limit for the dynamical mass ( 0.6 and 0.3@xmath210@xmath60m@xmath14 respectively , the latter according to the @xmath380.1@xmath210@xmath60m@xmath14 from aah00 ) , that implies young stellar mass contents of about 13% and 40% respectively .",
    "a detailed ifs study of the lirg arp  299 ( ic  694+ngc  3690 ) system covering a region of 7.0@xmath26.2 kpc has been presented .",

    "are summarized :    1 .",
    "the observed overall two dimensional stellar and ionized gas structure differs due to internal extinction effects caused by the dust , and to the different spatial distribution of the diverse ( agn , stars , shocks ) ionizing sources .",
    "the stellar continuum and emission line distribution peaks are not spatially coincident but separated up to 1.4 kpc .",
    "the peaks of the ionized gas traced by different emission lines ( e.g. hydrogen recombination , high excitation [ oiii ] , and shock - tracer [ oi ] ) are also not coincident indicating that the ionizing mechanisms change on scales of about 200 pc or less .",
    "the region b1 is identified as the true nucleus of ngc  3690 .",
    "the presence of an agn in b1 is inferred from the detection of a high - excitation seyfert - like conical structure of about 1.5 kpc in size , an opening angle of about 54@xmath36 , and its apex being located in b1 .",
    "this region also presents the additional characteristics of a dust -enshrouded nucleus with high extinction ( a@xmath29=3.7@xmath300.6 ) , red colors ( f160w - f222m=2.06@xmath300.1 ) indicating hot dust emission , and high velocity dispersion ( @xmath23=172@xmath3020 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the observed near - ir colors reveal the presence of hot dust over the entire structure . according to he f160w - f222 m color ,",
    "the upper limit for the mean hot dust contribution is about 30@xmath5 at 600 k for the majority of the star - forming regions .",
    "the nuclei a and b1 , and region c1 are the most affected by the hot dust component , with an upper limit of about 70@xmath5 , 80@xmath5 and 90@xmath5 at 600 k respectively .",
    "the high surface brightness regions are mainly dominated by star formation , while the low surface brightness regions are dominated by liner - like ionization process .",
    "the h@xmath1-emitting star - forming regions present an extinction of between a@xmath29=1@xmath226 mag , with ages between 3.3 and 7.2@xmath210@xmath3 years , and masses that range between about 6 and 680@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath14 .",
    "the total contribution ( extinction corrected ) of these sources to the bolometric luminosity is about 45% .",
    "the structure of the ionized ( h@xmath1 ) and neutral ( nad ) gas two dimensional velocity fields show similar features , indicating that both components are kinematically coupled on scales of hundreds of pc and larger .",
    "the velocity fields are very complex , and in general the galaxy does not appear to be dominated by ordered virialized simple ( e.g. rotation ) motions .",
    "the morphology of the velocity field does not correlate with the distribution of mass as traced by the continuum images , that is , no spatial coincidence between the kinematic and the photometric centers exists . + on average ,",
    "the interface region presents the lowest value of velocity dispersion ( @xmath23@xmath645 km s@xmath8 ) , ic  694 presents the intermediate values ( @xmath23@xmath665 km s@xmath8 ) , and ngc  3690 the highest ( @xmath23@xmath6120 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "this indicate that ngc  3690 is the warmest body of the entire system , and probably the most massive . on the contrary",
    ", the low velocity amplitude and velocity dispersion of the interface suggests that the ionized gas is slowly rotating or in a close quiescent phase .",
    "+ the velocity dispersion measurements over the nuclei and the brightest emitting regions , imply a mean value for the dynamical mass of about 1.2@xmath210@xmath64 m@xmath14 and 1.5 @xmath210@xmath64 for nuclei a and b1 respectively , within a mean radius of 58 pc and 28 pc . for regions",

    "<S> the large velocity dispersion measured in ngc  3690 indicates that this galaxy is the most massive of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the low velocity amplitude and dispersion of the interface suggest that the ionized gas is slowly rotating or in a close to quiescent phase . </S>"
