    "recent progress in experimental studies of hypernuclei has opened a new era of hypernuclear physics that challenges high precision understanding of hypernuclear structures and interactions .",
    "weak decays of hyperons especially provide us with rich phenomena in which nuclear many - body dynamics and nonperturbative qcd effects on hadronic weak interaction are important .",
    "nonmesonic weak decay of hypernucleus is unique as a new type of weak interaction process , which involves only baryons . in weak decays of heavy hypernuclei , pion emissions via @xmath7",
    "are hindered due to the pauli blocking on the final state nucleon .",
    "instead , the decay is mainly induced by a two - body transition , @xmath8 , and does not emit pions .",
    "this nonmesonic weak baryon - baryon interaction is analogous to the parity violating part of the nuclear force @xmath9 sector .",
    "the mechanism of nonmesonic decay of hypernuclei is a long standing problem due to some disagreements between theory and experiment .",
    "one of them is the @xmath10 ratio , i.e. , the ratio of @xmath11 and @xmath12 transitions .",
    "another , to the validity of @xmath5 rule .",
    "many studies have been done .",
    "the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) is the simplest to describe the @xmath8 transition .",
    "it has a similar structure as the ope in nuclear force and in both of them the tensor transition is strong . as it enhances @xmath13 ,",
    "the @xmath14 ratio is suppressed .",
    "typical prediction for ope is @xmath15 , while most experimental data indicate @xmath16 or larger  @xcite .    in the nonmesonic decay ,",
    "the @xmath17-@xmath18 mass difference is reflected in a high momentum transfer between the baryons , and therefore , short range interaction effects must be important .",
    "the lifetime measurements of heavy hypernuclei show saturation at large @xmath19 and therefore suggest importance of short range interactions @xcite .",
    "an attempt was made in refs .",
    "@xcite by considering the effect of the polarization of the pion propagator , which seems to enhance @xmath10 slightly .",
    "the @xmath20 meson contribution was calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , but it could not reproduce the experimental data . the two - pion exchange and the effective @xmath21 meson exchanges @xcite may play an important role because it increases the central attraction which enhances the @xmath10 ratio through the enhancement of the @xmath6 channels .",
    "the pseudoscalar and vector mesons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath22 , @xmath20 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) are considered in @xcite .",
    "the contribution of each meson comes out large , especially for kaon exchange , and significant cancellations between the different contributions are found @xcite .",
    "the final result is 4 - 6 times larger than the ope one @xcite .",
    "apart from the meson exchange model , several authors pointed out the importance of quark degrees of freedom in baryons @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed to treat the short range part using the valence quark picture of the baryon and the effective four quark weak hamiltonian .",
    "we found that the weak quark transition , called the direct quark ( dq ) process , gives significantly large contribution and shows qualitatively different features from the meson exchange mechanism , especially in its isospin structure @xcite . in this process the @xmath25 contribution is naturally involved , which is found to be important in the @xmath6 decay channels .",
    "we think that dq is a key process to solve the puzzle of @xmath14 ratio and to reveal the mechanisms of the @xmath5 rule for the weak @xmath9 decay .    in a previous paper @xcite , we proposed a quark - meson hybrid model , which includes the dq transition potential supplemented by the long - range part that comes from one - pion ( ope ) and one - kaon ( oke ) exchanges .",
    "it was shown that the model predicts fairly large @xmath14 for the decay of @xmath17 in nuclear matter . in this report",
    ", we apply this model to the weak decay of @xmath4 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "we especially concentrate on the effect of virtual @xmath3 mixing in @xmath0 system .    in sect.2",
    ", we discuss the basic ingredients of the calculation , and the weak transition potential is explained in sect.3 .",
    "the @xmath3 mixing contributions are considered in sect.4 .",
    "we show our results in sect.5 , and give the conclusions in sect.6 .",
    "light hypernuclei have advantages in order to extract pure information of the elementary process , as the emitted nucleons are less distorted than in medium and heavy hypernuclei , as @xmath28c , where final state deformations seem to be significant according to the recent data from kek @xcite .",
    "observables of the weak decay of light hypernuclei give us a clue to clear up some puzzles concerning the nonmesonic decay , the @xmath10 ratio and the @xmath5 dominance .",
    "block and dalitz  @xcite performed an analysis based on the lifetime data of light hypernuclei , which were updated by some other authors  @xcite .",
    "they tried to confirm the @xmath5 dominance in medium , but they were unsuccessful so far due to large uncertainties in the data .",
    "another advantage of the light hypernuclei is that the decay observables may give us evidence of virtual @xmath3 excitation in @xmath17 hypernuclei .",
    "this is the main interest of this paper .    for s - shell hypernuclei",
    ", the initial @xmath29 system can be assumed to be in the relative _",
    "s_-wave state , and we consider the @xmath30 transition with the six @xmath31 combinations listed in table [ tab : amp ] .",
    "note that @xmath4 may be mixed with @xmath32 , in which the @xmath33 pair induces a new decay channel with the @xmath34 final states , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "thus in table [ tab : amp ] , we have extra amplitudes @xmath36,@xmath37 , and @xmath38 , which are absent in the previous approaches .",
    "as the two proton final state does not appear without the virtual @xmath3 state , it should give a good signature of the @xmath3 mixing in @xmath39he .",
    ".possible @xmath31 combination and amplitudes for the @xmath30 transitions . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : di12 ]",
    "we calculate the nonmesonic decay rates of @xmath17 hypernuclei by using the quark - meson hybrid model . we have found that the @xmath40 part of @xmath13 is reduced by the @xmath2 exchange contribution , and the @xmath40 part of @xmath41 is enhanced both by the @xmath2 exchange and the dq contribution .",
    "thus the @xmath10 ratio becomes large , and the result is consistent with the current experimental data .",
    "we also estimate the effect of the virtual @xmath3 excitation which is known to be important when we consider the property of @xmath17 in nuclei . in this paper",
    "we add the @xmath42 amplitude to the @xmath8 amplitude by using the mixing parameter @xmath43 .",
    "we find that it changes the magnitudes of the nonmesonic decay rate significantly and our estimates of the decay rates agree with the experimental data fairly well for a negative @xmath44 .",
    "we have also pointed out that observation of final @xmath45-@xmath45 state from the decay of @xmath39he gives us a chance to show a clear evidence of the @xmath3 component in @xmath17 hypernucleus .",
    "our model predicts that the `` @xmath5 rule '' is largely violated in the @xmath6 transitions . in order to confirm the prediction ,",
    "a careful experiment of the @xmath39h decay is indispensable , which is now underway .",
    "the origin of the @xmath5 dominance in nonleptonic @xmath46 weak transitions is still under heavy discussion .",
    "the vertex corrections plus the penguin diagrams were shown to enhance @xmath5 .",
    "they alone , however , are not enough to reproduce the large ratio of the @xmath5 and @xmath25 amplitudes .",
    "there must be significant effects from the nonperturbative qcd corrections .",
    "the @xmath8 transition will be a new tool to determine the nonperturbative mechanism of the @xmath5 enhancement .",
