    "even in a collisionless stellar system , it is possible for density perturbations to grow , by inducing motions that reinforce the original overdensity .",
    "such collective instabilities typically require the unperturbed motion to be highly correlated , and they have been most thoroughly studied in thin disks , which are subject to a variety of instabilities when sufficiently `` cold . '' in elliptical galaxies , where the stellar motions are more nearly random in direction , density perturbations might be expected to rapidly attenuate as the stars move along their respective orbits .",
    "however it turns out that the motion in a variety of physically reasonable models of `` hot '' stellar systems is sufficiently correlated to induce growing modes ( as reviewed by * ? ? ?",
    "the two classes of instability that have most thoroughly been studied in this context are bending instabilities , which are driven by the centrifugal force of stars moving across a bend @xcite ; and the radial - orbit instability ( henceforth roi ) , which is caused by the tendency of eccentric orbits to clump around a bar - like distortion @xcite .",
    "bending instabilities may be responsible for the lack of elliptical galaxies more elongated than @xmath0 @xcite ; simulated dark - matter halos also appear never to exceed this degree of elongation , presumably because more flattened halos `` puff up '' due to the instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the roi , on the other hand , can be present even in precisely spherical galaxies if they contain an abundance of stars on elongated orbits .",
    "it manifests itself most naturally in collapse simulations , which produce prolate / triaxial bars if the initial conditions are sufficiently cold @xcite .",
    "the roi has also been invoked as a factor that regulates the density profiles of simulated dark - matter halos @xcite .",
    "construction of stationary models of hot stellar systems can be difficult , and this is one reason why most of the studies cited above have adopted highly symmetric models : typically spherical , in the case of the roi , and axisymmetric in the case of the bending mode studies .",
    "but there is no reason why such instabilities should be limited to spherical or axisymmetric models . here",
    ", we report on a dynamical instability in triaxial models that closely mimics in its behavior the roi of spherical models . as in the spherical case",
    ", the instability leads to a final configuration that is close to prolate .",
    "our simulations provide the first concrete evidence that dynamical instabilities may limit the permitted range of shapes of triaxial stellar systems , a result that may have implications for our understanding of elliptical galaxy and dark halo dynamics .    the self - consistent triaxial models on which our work is based were described in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe these models in  2 .",
    "the discretized models are described in  3 , and the results of @xmath1-body integrations in  4 and  5 .",
    " 6 explores the dependence of the stability properties of the models on their orbital composition .",
    " 7 discusses the implications for the dynamics of elliptical galaxies and dark matter halos .  8 sums up .",
    "the instability was discovered while testing , by @xmath1-body simulations , the equilibrium characteristics of the triaxial galaxy models constructed in clmv07 . in this section",
    "we summarize the way in which the self - consistent orbital solutions were obtained and in the next section we discuss the discretized models used in the @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "clmv07 constructed three different self - consistent solutions of triaxial , cuspy elliptical galaxies embedded in triaxial dark halos .",
    "the systems differ in terms of the shape of the dark matter halo : ( i ) one halo has the same axis ratios as the luminous matter ( 1:0.86:0.7 ) ; ( ii ) the second halo has a more prolate shape ( 1:0.66:0.5 ) ; ( iii ) the third halo has a more oblate shape ( 1:0.93:0.7 ) .",
    "our choice was to study the dynamical features of the most interesting case of maximal triaxiality ( i.e. , the model with triaxiality parameter @xmath2 ) , and to study the time evolution of the two self - consistent solutions ( mod1 and mod1-bis ) obtained in clmv07 for this case .",
    "the main difference between these two solutions was the maximum time adopted for the orbital integrations , which was , in mod1-bis , longer ( @xmath3 hubble times ) than in mod1 ( @xmath4 hubble times ) .",
    "the models were constructed by means of the orbital superposition method introduced by @xcite which relies on an optimization technique .",
    "the optimization problem consisted in minimizing the discrepancy between the model cell masses obtained by integration of the given analytical density law @xmath5 and those given by a linear combination of the orbits computed in the potential generated by @xmath6 . in our case ,",
    "the two quantities to be independently minimized were @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fraction of time that the @xmath9th orbit spends in the @xmath10th cell of the luminous - matter grid ( dark - matter grid ) ; @xmath11 is the mass which the model places in the @xmath10th cell of the luminous - matter grid ( dark - matter grid ) . @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the total mass , respectively , of the luminous and dark matter component assigned to the @xmath9th orbit ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the basic constraints were @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. , non - negative orbital weights .",
    "the departure from self - consistency was measured in clmv07 by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the average mass contained in the grid cells and @xmath19 are the quantities defined above ; thus @xmath20 represents the fractional rms deviation in the cell masses .",
    "the mass model considered in clmv07 for the luminous component was a triaxial generalization of dehnen s ( 1993 ) spherical model with a `` weak '' inner cusp , @xmath21 .",

    "in this section we explain the methods we used to discretize the self - consistent models described above and how we computed their properties for the @xmath1-body simulations .",

    "the initial conditions for the @xmath1-body integrations were set by populating the generic @xmath9th orbit with a number of particles proportional to @xmath34 and randomly choosing positions and velocities from the recorded data of the orbital integrations . in more detail :    * the values @xmath35 for both the dark matter and the luminous matter are read from model data and the following quantities are evaluated : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the total number of particles that populate the @xmath9th orbit while @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the number of stars and dark matter particles , respectively ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are free parameters that specify the mass of individual star and dark matter particles . * @xmath42 particles with masses @xmath40 , and @xmath43 particles with masses @xmath41 , are selected with positions and velocities drawn uniformly and randomly ( with respect to time ) from the stored positions and velocities of the orbit integration . *",

    "however , different values were chosen for the mass associated with dark and luminous components .",
    "we took @xmath45 and @xmath46 which gave , for instance in the case of mod1-bis , a total of @xmath47 particles , of which @xmath48 were `` stars '' and @xmath49 `` dark matter '' ; the mean number of particles per orbit was @xmath50 . with this resolution",

    "furthermore , the behavior of model @xmath157 suggests that the instability disappears when the dark halo is made isotropic , i.e. , the instability derives mainly from anisotropy in the dark component .",
    "we can draw the following conclusions from these integrations :    \\1 .",
    "the dynamical instability disappears when the fraction of semi - radial orbits in the models is decreased .",
    "the stability properties of these models are determined primarily by the kinematics of the dark matter halo .",
    "in particular , stable configurations are obtained when @xmath172 .",
    "@xmath51{fig14a.ps }   & \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3in]{fig14b.ps }                       \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath51{fig15a.ps }   & \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3in]{fig15b.ps }                       \\end{array}$ ]",
    "large - scale simulations of structure formation have shown that dark matter halos , during their evolution , develop universal properties , such as a characteristic density profile , a power - law dependence of phase space density on radius , a linear relation between the velocity anisotropy and the density slope ( @xmath173 relation ) , and a particular distribution of shapes and spins @xcite .",
    "various authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have argued that dynamical processes during mergers may be responsible for the apparent universality of these relations . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite have pointed out that many of these properties are also reproduced in a universe where halos form via monolithic collapse , suggesting that mergers are not essential for establishing the universal relations .",
    "some of the regularity in dark matter halo properties may be due to dynamical instabilities , which limit the range of allowed equilibrium states irrespective of how the halos formed .",
    "a well - established example is the effect of bending instabilities on the shapes of hot stellar systems : major to minor axis ratios are limited to @xmath174 for both oblate and prolate systems @xcite .",
    "this is a plausible explanation for the lack of elliptical galaxies flatter than hubble type e7 @xcite , and is also consistent with the maximum elongations found for simulated dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "the role of the roi in establishing such `` universal '' characteristics is less clear .",
    "the roi arises naturally in halos formed via monolithic collapse , causing otherwise spherical systems to settle into prolate / triaxial shapes @xcite .",
    "the instability also reduces the dependence of the final concentration on the initial `` temperature '' of the collapsing cloud @xcite . but formation via mergers is qualitatively different from collapse ; and since a ( spherical ) model can always be rendered stable by making its velocity distribution sufficiently isotropic , the role that the roi plays in determining the structure of dark matter halos is likely to depend somewhat on the details of the halo formation process .",
    "we nevertheless note that the halos formed in hierarchical cosmologies tend to exhibit radially - anisotropic envelopes , @xmath175 @xcite , and that these anisotropies are similar to those of unstable models formed via collapse , both before and after the roi has run its course @xcite , and consistent with the values that render our two - component models unstable .",
    "so it is plausible that the roi or something similar is active during the hierarchical formation of halos .",
    "figure  [ fig16 ] presents a weak test of this idea .",
    "axis ratios of our unstable halo models ( panel @xmath176 ) are compared with those of dark matter halos formed in various cosmological simulations ( panel @xmath177 ) and with @xmath1-body models formed via simulations of isolated collapse ( panel @xmath178 ) . as noted above",
    ", the instability has the effect of making our initially triaxial models more prolate and more elongated . in the absence of rotation ( ll ) ,",
    "the final shapes are more prolate than for typical cosmological halos .",
    "however in the models with streaming motions ( hl ) , the final axis ratios are essentially identical to the average values found in the cosmological simulations .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn from the isolated collapses in panel ( c ) , which also tend to be more triaxial ( i.e. less prolate ) when rotation is present .",
    "we stress again that our unstable models could be rendered stable by selecting different sets of orbits , in the same way that unstable spherical models can be stabilized by making their velocity distributions more isotropic . the role of the roi in structuring dark matter halos must therefore depend somewhat on the orbital composition of halos formed in the cosmological simulations .",
    "we explored the stability properties of two , self - consistent models of triaxial galaxies embedded in triaxial dark matter halos .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "both models were found to be dynamically unstable , evolving toward more prolate shapes on a time scale of @xmath131 crossing times .",
    "final shapes were approximately prolate in both components , with short - to - long axis ratios of @xmath179 .",
    "the evolution was shown not to be due to errors in construction of the equilibrium models , nor to diffusion of chaotic orbits , but rather to a collective mode . on this basis",
    "we identified the instability with the roi of spherical models .",
    "\\3 . including streaming motions in the initial models leads to final configurations that are more triaxial than when rotation is absent .",
    "these final shapes are very similar to the mean shapes of dark matter halos formed in hierarchical merger simulations .",
    "when the number of box - like orbits is reduced below a certain threshold the dynamical instability disappears .",
    "the presence or absence of the instability is most strongly affected by the number of box - like orbits in the dark matter halo ; stable configurations are obtained when @xmath180 .",
