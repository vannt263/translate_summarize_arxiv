    "appreciation of the role of quantum entanglement @xcite as a resource in quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum communication @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , and quantum metrology @xcite has stimulated intensive qualitative and quantitative research .",
    "entanglement , as the quantum correlation , can bring up richer possibilities in the various fields of modern technology .",
    "therefore , in the past few years great efforts have been done to understand and create entanglement .",
    "entanglement between two quantum systems can be generated due to their interaction only @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that , in a chain of nuclear spins @xmath0 = 1/2 , which is described by the idealized xy model for a spin system under the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions , entanglement appears at very low temperatures @xmath1 @xmath2k @xcite .    in most real quantum systems , such as dipolar coupling spin system ,",
    "specific conditions for creation of the entangled states are requested . in two - and",
    "three - spin @xcite and many - spin @xcite clusters of protons subjected to a strong magnetic field , truncated dipole - dipole interactions and multiple pulse radiofrequence irradiations , the entangled state of a spin pair emerges at temperatures @xmath3 mk . in these papers",
    "the cases were considered where the energy of interaction of the spins with the external magnetic field ( the zeeman energy ) is greater than the energy of dipole interactions by three orders @xcite .",
    "it was shown that at this condition only a non - equilibrium state of the spin system , realized by pulse radiofrequence irradiations , results in entanglement @xcite .    the present paper deals with the case opposite to those considered previously",
    "@xcite : the dipolar interaction energy is the order of magnitude or even greater than the zeeman one .",
    "we investigate entanglement of two spins coupled by the realistic dipole - dipole interactions in a low external magnetic field under the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions .",
    "we study dependence of the critical temperature and magnetic field at which entanglement appears in this system on a dipolar coupling constant .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath4 spins coupled by long - range dipolar interactions and subjected to an external magnetic field , @xmath5 .",
    "the total hamiltonian of this interacting system can be written as @xmath6 where the hamiltonian @xmath7 describes the zeeman interaction between the nuclear spins and external magnetic field ( here we used @xmath8 ) @xmath9 @xmath10 is the energy difference between the excited and ground states of an isolated spin , @xmath11 is the gyromagnetic ratio of a spin , @xmath12 is the projection of the angular spin momentum operator on the @xmath13- axes .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 describing dipolar interactions in an external magnetic field @xcite : @xmath15   -\\nonumber\\\\ &   \\frac{3}{4}\\sin2\\theta_{jk}\\left [   e^{-i\\varphi_{jk}}\\left (   i_{j}^{z}% i_{k}^{+}+i_{j}^{+}i_{k}^{z}\\right )   + e^{i\\varphi_{jk}}\\left (   i_{j}^{z}% i_{k}^{-}+i_{j}^{-}i_{k}^{z}\\right )   \\right ]   -\\frac{3}{4}\\sin^{2}\\theta _ { jk}\\left [   e^{-2i\\varphi_{jk}}i_{j}^{+}i_{k}^{+}+e^{2i\\varphi_{jk}}i_{j}% ^{-}i_{k}^{-}\\right ]   \\ } \\tag{3}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the spherical coordinates of the vector @xmath19 connecting the @xmath20th and @xmath21th nuclei in a coordinate system with the @xmath13-axis along the external magnetic field , @xmath22 , @xmath23and @xmath24 are the raising and lowering spin angular momentum operators of the @xmath25-th spin .",
    "we consider the situation when it is necessary to take into account all the terms of the hamiltonian of the dipole - dipole interactions , and not trusnckete any ones .    in the thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "the considered system is described by the density matrix @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the partition function , @xmath28 is the boltzamnn constant , and @xmath29 is the temperature",
    ". we will analyze entanglement in the spin system described by the density matrix ( 4 ) .    in order to quantify entanglement ,",
    "the concurrence @xmath30 is usually used @xcite . for the maximally entangled states , the concurrence is @xmath31 , while for the separable states @xmath32 .",
    "the concurrence between the quantum states of two spins presented in the hilbert space as a matrix @xmath33 is expressed by the formula @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the product @xmath38 with@xmath39 where @xmath40 the complex conjugation of the density matrix ( 4 ) and @xmath41 is the pauli matrix @xmath42",
    "we examine dependence of the concurrence , @xmath30 , between states of the two spins 1/2 on the magnetic field strength and its direction , dipolar coupling constant , and temperature .",
    "the numerical calculation of _ _ entanglement of the spins at arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field are performed using the software based on the mathematica package .",
    "the results of the numerical calculation show that concurrence reaches its maximum at the case of @xmath43and @xmath44 ( fig . 1 ) and we will consider this case below .",
    "this orientation of the spins allows us to obtain for concurrence as an exact analytical function of the temperature , magnetic field and dipolar coupling constant @xmath45 . using the exact diagonalization of the density matrix ( 4 )",
    "we obtain the concurrence in the following form : @xmath46 where@xmath47 @xmath48with @xmath49 and @xmath50    at high temperature and low magnetic field @xmath51 and/or small dipolar coupling constant ( @xmath52 the expression in the figure brackets ( 9 ) becomes negative and , therefore , entanglement is zero . equating this expression to zero we",
    "obtain the critical parameters : temperature @xmath53 , strength of magnetic field @xmath54 , and dipolar coupling constant at which the entanglement appears in a spin pair .",
    "_ _ figure 2 presents the phase diagram in which the boundary between the entangled and separated states is determined from equation : @xmath55 for example , at @xmath56 entanglement can be achieved at @xmath57 .",
    "to  estimate the critical temperature let us consider fluorine with @xmath58 and the dipolar interaction energy typically of order of a few khz ( in frequency units ) @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath59 @xmath60 g we have @xmath61 khz , which leads to @xmath62 @xmath2k .",
    "the estimated value of temperature is in good agreement with those reported early for the spin system @xmath63 with the @xmath64 hamiltonian in absence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "both models give also qualitatively similar dependences of concurrence on temperature but the model considered by us predicts appearance of entanglement in an external magnetic field higher than the critical value .",
    "it is interesting that the ordered states , such as antiferromagnetic , of nuclear spins were observed in a calcium - fluoride @xmath65 single crystal at @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath2k  @xcite .",
    "this structure is characterized by domains in the form of layers perpendicular to the external magnetic field .",
    "the magnetization inside the crystal is parallel to the external field and reverses its sign from a layer to a layer , while the total magnetization is zero .",
    "it is well know that when the magnetization reaches the maximum , all the spins are aligned along the field and entanglement is absent _ _ @xcite .",
    "entanglement can appear if magnetization is less than its maximum .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that simultaneously with the transition to the ordered state there arises entanglement of spins from different layers .",
    "figure 3 shows concurrence as a function of both parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 at @xmath43and @xmath44 . at large temperature and",
    "low magnetic field concurrence is zero .",
    "one can see that the concurrence increases with the magnetic field and inverse temperature and reaches its maximum .",
    "then the concurrence decreases .",
    "figure 4 shows the concurrence as a function of the magnetic field at a constant temperature , ( fig .",
    "4a ) and as a function of the inverse temperature at a constant magnetic field _ _ ( fig .",
    "4b ) . in the both cases concurrence remains zero up to a certain value of the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "4a ) or of the inverse temperature ( fig .",
    "4b ) , which depends on the coupling constant .",
    "the following increase of the magnetic field or inverse temperature leads to eventually rising . in the case of increasing",
    "the magnetic field concurrence increases up to the maximum  and then decreases as a magnetic field _",
    "_ increases ( fig.4a ) .",
    "another behavior is observed at an increase of the inverse temperature ( fig .",
    "4b ) : concurrence monotone grows with @xmath70  up to a _ _ steady _ _ value depending on a magnetic field and the following increase of the inverse temperature does not cause any change of concurrence .",
    "it was obtained that in zero magnetic field the system is in a separable state .",
    "the system becomes entangled when the interaction energy of spins with the magnetic field are of the order of the dipolar interaction energy .",
    "then , with increasing magnetic field the spin state tends to separable one . at a small dipolar coupling constant @xmath71 from the exact analytical solution ( 9 )",
    "we obtain the following expression for the concurrency @xmath72 therefore , at these conditions the states of the system are always separable , @xmath32 .",
    "entanglement appears in the course of increasing the dipolar coupling constant . to distinguish an entangled state from separable ones ,",
    "it is important to determine an entanglement witness ( ew ) applicable to the _ _  _ _ considered quantum system @xcite .",
    "the determination of ew is one of the main problems of the experimental study of the entangled states .",
    "internal energy @xcite , magnetic susceptibility @xcite , magnetization @xcite , and intensity of mq coherences @xcite were used as ew in different quantum systems . with the aim to obtain the correlation between the nuclear magnetization and concurrence , using ( 4 ) and the definition of nuclear magnetization @xmath73 , we obtain the exact expression for magnetization as a function of parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 at @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76  as example , at @xmath77 , the relation between the concurrence and magnetization can be fitted by @xmath78 ( figure 5 ) .",
    "concurrence , the measure of entanglement between the states of the two spins , depends on the orientation of the magnetic field relative to vector @xmath79 connecting the nuclei . at @xmath80 and @xmath81 the states are separable and the concurrence reaches its maximum at the case of @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this effect can open a way to manipulate with the spin state by a rotation of the magnetic field or a sample .",
    "in conclusion , investigation of entanglement in a spin 1/2 system under the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions showed that the entangled state can be achieved by application of a low external field when the zeeman interaction energy is the order of or even less than the dipolar interaction one .",
    "it was estimated that for magnetic field @xmath59",
    "@xmath60 g , the entangled state in a two - spin system arises at temperature @xmath83 @xmath2k .",
