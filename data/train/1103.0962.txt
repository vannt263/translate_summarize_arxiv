    "the triangulum - andromeda ( triand ) star cloud was identified as a low - latitude overdensity of m giant stars in the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) by rocha - pinto et al .",

    "( 2004 , hereafter m04 ) .",
    "rp04 and m04 found the structure to extend across at least @xmath0 of the halo at a heliocentric distance of 15 - 30 kpc .",
    "the mean heliocentric radial velocity of the structure is @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , and its mean [ fe / h ] is @xmath3 dex based on calcium infrared triplet measurements by rp04 . though a subsequent megacam survey of msto stars in this sky region ( martin , ibata , & irwin 2007 ) confirmed a @xmath4 kpc distance for this stellar structure , to date little additional attention has been given to triand , including determining its properties at any level of detail useful for ascertaining the origin of the structure .    in contrast , significantly more attention has been given to the galactic anticenter stellar structure ( gass ) , also called the `` monoceros stream '' or `` monoceros ring '' , which was discovered only two years before triand as several overdensities of presumed msto stars ( newberg et al .",
    "2002 ) in the same general region of the galactic anticenter as triand but at a closer mean @xmath5 kpc heliocentric distance .",
    "subsequent study of this ring - like structure with the isaac newton telescope wide field camera ( ibata et al .",
    "2003 ; conn et al . 2005 ) , sloan digital sky survey spectroscopy and photometry ( yanny et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter y03 ) , and as traced by 2mass m giants ( crane et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter c03 ; majewski et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter m03 ; rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter rp03 ) has shown that the low latitude gass ring spans at least the second and third galactic quadrants and has a wide metallicity spread , from [ fe / h]= @xmath6 ( y03 ) to @xmath7 ( c03 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the origin of gass remains controversial .",
    "principal scenarios include those where gass is a piece / warp of the galactic disk ( momany et al .",
    "2006 ; kazantzidis et al . 2008 ; younger et al . 2008 ) versus those where it represents tidal debris from the disruption of a milky way ( mw ) satellite galaxy ( ibata at al . 2003 ; y03 ; c03 ; rp03 ; helmi et al . 2003 ; frinchaboy et al .",
    "2004 ; martin et al . 2004 ; pearrubia et al . 2005 ; conn et al . 2005 ; rocha - pinto et al . 2006 ) .",
    "a comparison of chemical patterns between the gass and other dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies has recently been made in chou et al .",
    "( 2010b , hereafter c10b ) .",
    "their gass sample reveals similar abundance patterns for ti , y and la as in the sagittarius dwarf+stream system and other satellite galaxies , which suggests that stars in gass likely formed in a dwarf galaxy - like environment .",
    "however , this chemical observation does not in itself conclusively resolve the debate over the _",
    "dynamical _ origin of gass because theoretical models show that galactic disks grow outward by accretion of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "2003 ; yong , carney , & teixera de almeida 2005 ) , and whether gass represents an intact tidal stream versus some other galactic structure generated from a previously hierarchically - formed , outer disk is not clarified by this chemistry .    the lack of a definitive origin model for gass notwithstanding , soon after the triand discovery it was proposed by pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that this structure may simply be an outlying piece of gass / mon , which these authors hypothesized to be a structure formed from the dissolution of a mw satellite galaxy .",
    "both structures are at similar galactic latitudes , and pearrubia et al . were able to find an @xmath8-body simulation that could incorporate triand as a dynamically older , earlier - stripped piece from the putative mon progenitor galaxy , under the assumption that the position of this progenitor is in canis major ( the latter aspect motivated by the claim of a canis major overdensity interpreted as the core of a disrupting dsph by martin et al .",
    "2004  itself a greatly debated issue ; see rocha - pinto et al .",
    "2006 , mateu et al .",
    "2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "if triand and gass / mon are parts of the same dwarf galaxy system , then the stars in these two structures share a common chemical enrichment history and should in principle show similar enrichment patterns  e.g. , those seen by c10b for gass / mon . in effect",
    ", one could apply `` chemical fingerprinting '' to determine whether the stars in triand belong to the gass / mon system .",
    "this technique was recently applied by chou et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter c10a ) to show that a group of m giant stars in the north galactic hemisphere ( the `` ngc moving group '' ) are likely older pieces of the sagittarius ( sgr ) tidal stream .",
    "a comparison to the sgr system is quite apropos in the study of mon and triand , since sgr exhibits many similar properties to both , including a relatively high metallicity with the presence of m giant stars in all three cases ( m03 ; rp03 ; rp04 ) that suggest the progenitor systems of all three substructures may have been somewhat similar .",
    "therefore , following the above precedents from our previous chemical studies of halo substructure , in this paper we make the first high resolution spectroscopic assessment of the chemical abundance patterns in the triand system , and use these abundance measurements to investigate the hypothesized connection between the triand and gass / mon systems .",
    "our analysis of triand stars is identical to that used for sgr and gass m giants described in c07 , c10a and c10b .",
    "we use spectra from echelle spectrographs mounted on the apache point observatory 3.5-m and kitt peak national observatory 4-m telescopes , with resolutions @xmath9 and 35,000 , respectively .",
    "we measure equivalent widths ( ews ) of eleven lines , two lines , and one line , and use spectral synthesis for one line in the spectral region 7440 - 7590   previously studied by smith & lambert ( 1985 ; 1986 ; 1990 ) .",
    "we use the lte code moog ( sneden 1973 ) to derive abundances of these elements following the same procedures as in c07 , c10a and c10b , and adopt the same model atmospheres , generated by linear interpolation from the grids of atlas9 models in castelli & kurucz ( 2003 ) .",
    "our analysis used their odfnew models without convective overshooting .",
    "we observed six triand m giants selected to have the photometric parallax and radial velocity of that system from the sample described in rp04 .",
    "observed gass stars range from @xmath10 , while the triand stars span a narrower , @xmath11 range .",
    "nevertheless , both samples have the same @xmath12 blue limit and about the same intrinsic rgb luminosity , as evidenced by a comparison to the fitted isochrones ( see  3 ) .",
    "the primary difference is that the gass sample includes more very red , presumably asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars so that the red limits are @xmath13 for triand and @xmath14 for gass ; this yields mean @xmath15 colors of 1.05 and 1.09 dex for the full triand and gass samples , respectively .",
    "the apparent @xmath16 magnitudes and dereddened @xmath15 colors ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) for our target triand stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "the same information for gass stars is found in c10b .",
    "the derived abundances are also summarized in table 1 .",
    "table 1 columns give the derived effective temperature using the houdashelt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) color - temperature relation applied to the 2mass @xmath15 color , and the derived values of the surface gravity ( @xmath17 ) , microturbulence ( @xmath18 ) , abundance @xmath19(x ) , and abundance ratios [ fe / h ] or [ x / h ] for each element x as well as the standard deviation in the abundance determinations .",
    "the latter represent the line - to - line scatter ( for fe , ti and y ) for the ew measures , or different continuum level adjustments ( for la ) , as discussed in c07 and c10a .",
    "uncertainties in abundance ratios are derived as in c10b .",
    "briefly , we account for both uncertainties in measured ews as well as propagated uncertainties from the adopted stellar parameters .",
    "the latter mainly come from the color - calibrated effective temperatures and imprecise knowledge of the proper isochrones to use for each star .",
    "the net uncertainties are estimated to be 0.14 , 0.20 , 0.19 , 0.16 for [ fe / h ] , [ ti / fe ] , [ y / fe ] and [ la / fe ] , respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the triand and gass m giant candidates . based on our derived [ fe / h ] for each star ( indicated by the color scale )",
    "we roughly matched these distributions with a set of marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) isochrones for 8 gyr , [ @xmath20/fe]=0 , rgb / agb stars . the choice of 8 gyr matches the approximate age of sgr stars of [ fe / h ] @xmath21 ( siegel et al .",
    "2007 ) ; analogy with sgr is the only information available to inform such a decision for the systems of interest here .",
    "the corresponding isochrone distances are @xmath2212 kpc ( gass ) and @xmath2222 kpc ( triand ) ; these are consistent with previous estimates of the distances to these structures .",
    "however , due to the age - metallicity degeneracy of rgb isochrones , other combinations of age and metallicity also fit reasonably well  e.g. , 5 gyr old isochrones at 25 kpc and 14 kpc also fit the triand and gass distributions , respectively . the wider cmd spread of gass stars having similar metallicities to each other ( e.g. , [ fe / h]@xmath22@xmath23 ) suggests a potentially larger relative distance spread ( @xmath2211 - 22 kpc ) for gass stars compared to triand if we assume tight , monotonic age - metallicity relations in the two systems .",
    "figure 2 compares derived distributions of [ ti / fe ] , [ y / fe ] , and [ la / fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] for our triand , gass / mon ( from c10b ) and sgr stars ( from c07 , c10a ) .",
    "a strength of the following comparison of triand , gass / mon and sgr stars is that not only are our abundances for all three systems derived homogeneously using the same methodology ( same lines , same model atmospheres , same derivation of stellar parameters , etc . ) , but the stars selected for comparison span a very narrow range of stellar atmospheric parameters ( @xmath24k in temperature and @xmath25 dex in @xmath17 ) so that the lines under study are forming under similar atmospheric conditions .",
    "linear fits to the mw distributions ( see c10a ) are also shown in figure 2 .",
    "in contrast to the general chemical similarity of gass and sgr ( except for [ la / fe ] at the highest metallicities ; see c10b ) , we note some larger differences between triand and these other two systems ( fig .",
    "2 ) . while the mean trend of [ ti / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for the triand stars is somewhat similar to the mean trends for sgr and gass ( though the three of six sampled triand stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath26 fall well below stars of similar metallicity in sgr and gass ) ,",
    "the s - process element patterns reveal more obvious differences .",
    "the mean level of [ y / fe ] ( middle panel ) for triand stars is about 0.2 dex higher ( or about 2.5 times the error in the mean for triand ) than that for either sgr or gass stars at the same [ fe / h ] , and almost at the solar enrichment level and near the mean for mw stars . and",
    "while the [ la / fe ] pattern of triand stars closely resembles that of sgr stars ( including one star at [ fe / h ] = @xmath27 with enhanced [ la / fe ] , hinting at a possible upturn at high metallicity ) , it is less similar to , and slightly enhanced compared to , the gass pattern , at least in the mean .    to put this comparison on a more quantitative footing ,",
    "we apply the statistical method of bootstrap sampling ( e.g. , efron 1979 ; efron & tibshirani 1993 ) to judge the differences between triand and gass . for a more conservative test , we combine the @xmath28 data points of triand+gass stars for [ ti / fe ] and [ y / fe ] , and @xmath29 for [ la / fe ] as if all stars are from one dsph system .",
    "we then randomly pick six stars from the 27 triand+gass star sample , and compute and compare the mean values for [ ti / fe ] , [ y / fe ] and [ la / fe ] for the six selected and 21 non - selected stars ( or , in the case of [ la / fe ] , five from 24 stars ) .",
    "this process is repeated with 10,000 random selections of six ( five ) stars .",
    "the derived distributions of the bootstrap samplings for ti , y and la are approximately normally distributed , and we find that there are only @xmath30 with mean [ ti / fe ] less than the mean value of triand stars in the 10,000 bootstrap samples , and @xmath31 with mean [ y / fe ] and @xmath32 with mean [ la / fe ] more than those in triand stars .",
    "if the bootstrap sampling is repeated with the same procedure as above but for only gass stars , we find only @xmath33 with mean [ ti / fe ] less than triand in the 10,000 bootstrap samples , and only @xmath34 with mean [ y / fe ] and 0 with mean [ la / fe ] more than triand .",
    "if we restrict the gass stars to the same color range spanned by the triand stars ( @xmath35_o \\le 1.07 $ ] ) to minimize metallicity selection biases , we find the mean [ fe / h ] for eight gass stars to be @xmath36 dex with a dispersion ( standard deviation ) of 0.26 dex , compared with a mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath37 dex with a dispersion of 0.19 dex for the six triand stars . applying the bootstrap method for the more conservative test we described above",
    ", we find that there are only @xmath38 with mean [ ti / fe ] less than the mean value of triand stars in the 10,000 bootstrap samples , and @xmath39 with mean [ y / fe ] and @xmath40 with mean [ la / fe ] more than those in triand stars for the combination of @xmath41 data points of triand+gass stars for [ ti / fe ] and [ y / fe ] , and @xmath42 for [ la / fe ] .",
    "if we repeat the bootstrap sampling for the eight gass stars only and compare results with the mean values in triand , we find only @xmath43 with mean [ ti / fe ] less than triand in the 10,000 bootstrap samples , and 0 with mean [ y / fe ] and [ la / fe ] more than triand , respectively .",
    "given the marked degree to which the mean values of _ all three _ of the [ ti / fe ] , [ y / fe ] and [ la / fe ] ratios for triand stars are different from corresponding means for the various bootstrap samples , we conclude that there might be significant chemical differences between the two systems , sufficient to suggest that triand is not likely a part of the gass system .",
    "as discussed in c10a , distinctive abundance patterns in stars reflect the unique enrichment history of their parent system , and therefore `` chemical fingerprinting '' can help identify tidally stripped and captured stars in the galactic field .",
    "the chemical patterns of @xmath20-elements ( e.g. , ti ) and s - process elements ( e.g. , y and la ) may indicate differences in the ( early ) star formation rate ( sfr ) between the progenitors of the triand , sgr , and gass systems , as well as the mw . for example , @xmath20-elements are mainly produced from type ii supernovae ( sn ii ) while iron is synthesized largely by type ia ( sn ia ) .",
    "so [ @xmath20/fe ] is high in the early enrichment of a stellar system until sn ia occur after the first @xmath44 gyr .",
    "a shift to a lower [ @xmath20/fe ] trend compared to the mw at some particular [ fe / h ] indicates a relatively slower initial sfr in that system , a feature seen in many dsph galaxies as well as the lmc ( e.g. , smith et al .  2002 , shetrone et al .  2003 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2003 ; venn et al .",
    "2004 ; geisler et al .  2005 ; pompia et al .  2008 ; c10a ) .",
    "triand follows the same @xmath20 trends as dsph galaxies , consistent with an origin in a dwarf galaxy - like environment and , like other mw satellites , a low early sfr compared to the mw .",
    "the s - process elements are primarily generated in low mass agb stars . in more metal - poor environments",
    "agb stars produce heavier s - process elements like la more efficiently than lighter species such as y ( see review by busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 ) .",
    "c10a found underabundant trends in [ y / fe ] for all sgr stars compared to the mw , and an upturn in [ la / fe ] for sgr at [ fe / h]@xmath45@xmath46 .",
    "the latter trend also can be seen in mcwilliam & smecker - hane ( 2005 ) , and is an indication of a slow enrichment history , so that the yields from low - metallicity agb stars have enough time to contaminate the interstellar medium and leave their signature on the metal - rich populations ( venn et al .",
    "2004 ; pompia et al.2008 ) .",
    "the [ y / fe ] trends in triand stars are slightly higher than those in either sgr and gass and somewhat closer to mw trends , whereas triand shows a slightly lower [ la / fe ] pattern compared to sgr .",
    "this suggests that agb stars in the triand progenitor produced heavy s - process elements less efficiently than in sgr  i.e. , that low metallicity agb progenitors in triand contributed relatively less heavy s - process enrichment than those in sgr . this may also indicate that the triand progenitor was more metal - rich than the sgr progenitor . on the other hand ,",
    "the one triand star with [ fe / h]@xmath45@xmath46 shows slightly supersolar [ la / fe ] ( like the sgr [ la / fe ] pattern , only less extreme ) , but above the gass [ la / fe ] pattern at these metallicities .",
    "this may suggest that the triand system enriched more slowly than the progenitor(s ) that generated the gass stars , but more similar in rate to the sgr dsph , to allow expression of the high la yields from those relatively fewer low metallicity agb stars that it did contain ; but this conclusion must be regarded as quite tentative , given the errors on individual abundances and that this is based on only a single high metallicity triand star .",
    "the @xmath8-body simulations from pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that triand may be an older piece of the mon tidal stream . according to the sgr paradigm ,",
    "older debris should be more metal - poor than younger debris , but share the same chemical pattern trends if from the same parent system .",
    "indeed , pearrubia et al .",
    "associate older model stream wraps with lower metallicity stars , but these data derive from lower resolution spectroscopic measures of ca ii line indices for gass and triand stars ( c03 , rp04 ) . though our study here has focused on better precision , high resolution abundance determinations , including [ fe / h ] derived from eleven individual fe line measures , unfortunately the sample of stars is still too small to make definitive conclusions about the relative metallicity of the two systems . on the other hand , the sample of triand and gass stars in hand does offer tantalizing evidence that , at least at the metallicities that were sampled , triand does not reveal the same chemical pattern trends as gass and that therefore the triand star cloud is not part of an extended gass system .",
    "that said , larger samples of gass and triand stars having precisely determined metallicities and chemical abundance patterns would certainly provide a more conclusive chemical test of the possible connection between these two systems , as well as more insights into the origin and evolution of their respective progenitors .",
