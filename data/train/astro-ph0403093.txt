    "two - dimensional simulations of compressible convection have shown that it is possible to excite internal gravity waves ( igw ) in radiative zones of solar - type stars from the downward penetrating plumes ( hurlburt et al . , @xcite , hereafter htm86 ; hurlburt et al . , @xcite ; kiraga and jahn , @xcite ) .",
    "however , detecting igw with confidence is challenging given the stochastic nature of the excitation mechanism .",
    "we propose here a new detection method which allows us to measure rigorously both the spectrum and amplitude of excited @xmath0-modes .",
    "this method is first applied to the @xmath0-mode oscillations of an isothermal atmosphere and then , to igw generated in a 2d - simulation of a convective zone embedded between two stable ones .",
    "in hydrosimulations , wave fields are commonly measured using two main methods : _ ( i ) _ the simplest one consists in recording the vertical velocity at a fixed point and then performing the fourier transform of the sequence ( see , e.g. , htm86 ) ; _ ( ii ) _ a more complicated method consists in taking two fourier transforms , in space and time , of the vertical mass flux ( stein and nordlund , @xcite ) . however ,",
    "these two methods are not well adapted to detect igw in our problem because the fourier transforms are calculated over the _ whole _ simulation while igw are _ stochastically _ excited by penetrating plumes .",
    "our new detection method takes into account the random nature of this excitation .",
    "indeed , it is based first , on projections of the simulated velocity field @xmath1 onto the anelastic eigenvectors @xmath2 as    @xmath3    and second , on time - frequency diagrams of the complex coefficients @xmath4 . as a consequence ,",
    "the immediate spectrum ( the set of frequencies @xmath5 ) and amplitudes ( defined as @xmath6 ) of stochastically excited @xmath0-modes are reached and not only their `` mean '' values over the whole simulation .",
    "it is instructive to consider the simplest possible case , that is , the propagation of a single gravity mode with horizontal wavenumber @xmath7 through the computation domain : applying eq .",
    "( [ projec ] ) leads in this case to a projection coefficient @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the frequency of the anelastic eigenmode of degree @xmath7 and order @xmath10 .",
    "( here @xmath11 is in units of @xmath12).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   ( here @xmath11 is in units of @xmath12).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]      as a first test , we apply our method to detect igw excited by an oscillating entropy bubble embedded in an isothermal atmosphere of depth @xmath13 ( see fig . 1 , left panel ) .",
    "in this case , the building of the anelastic subspace is simplified since we found analytic solutions for the eigenfrequencies and their associated eigenvectors ( dintrans et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "1 ( right panel ) , we show the real part of the projection coefficient @xmath14 , i.e. we projected the left panel velocity field onto the first anelastic eigenmode of the isothermal atmosphere at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "as expected , we found that @xmath17 behaves like @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the constant adiabatic sound speed ) whereas the mode amplitude @xmath21 decreases as @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 being the constant kinematic viscosity of the simulation ) .",
    "once our method validated , we study the excitation of igw by overshooting convection using high - resolution two - dimensional simulations of a three - layer polytropic model . that is , we solve the following equations :      where @xmath26 denotes the velocity , @xmath27 the internal energy , @xmath28 the density , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radiative conductivity and @xmath31 the specific heat at constant volume , @xmath32 the stress tensor and , finally , @xmath33 is a cooling time ( see brandenburg et al .",
    ", @xcite for more details ) .",
    "figure 2 ( left panel ) shows an example of such a simulation of a convective zone of depth @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) embedded between two stable ones ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "igw are excited in the bottom radiative zone by penetrating downward plumes and the evolution of the projection coefficient @xmath14 is now more chaotic ( see right panel ) .",
    "however , by applying a time - frequency diagram on this sequence , we extracted three igw events ( with @xmath38 ) , emphasized as thick lines in the figure .",
