    "solvable models of coulomb systems have attracted attention for quite some time . very recently the two - dimensional two - component plasma , a model of two species of point - particles with opposite charges @xmath1 at inverse temperature @xmath2 , has been solved in its whole range of stability @xmath3 by using a mapping of this system into a sine - gordon field theory . with this mapping",
    "the grand - partition function and other bulk properties of the system can be computed exactly .",
    "also some surface properties near a metallic wall and an ideal dielectric wall have been investigated .",
    "however this mapping into a sine - gordon model does not give ( yet ) any information on correlation functions .    when the coupling constant @xmath0 the corresponding sine - gordon model is at its free fermion point and additional information on the system can be obtained .",
    "this fact is well known and much work has been done on the two - component plasma at @xmath0 since the pioneer work of gaudin on this model . in particular",
    "the two - component plasma at @xmath0 has been studied in different geometries : near a plane hard wall and a dielectric interface , a metallic wall , in a disk with hard walls and in a disk with metallic walls  .",
    "however it was not until very recently that the special case of ideal dielectric boundaries ( that is neumann boundary conditions imposed on the electric potential ) has been studied by jancovici and amaj for a system near an infinite plane wall or confined in a strip .",
    "the technical difficulty with this kind of boundary conditions is that the two - component plasma must be mapped into a four - component free fermi field instead of a two - component free fermi field as in all other cases of boundary conditions .",
    "a very interesting result of reference  [ @xcite ] is that when the system is confined in a strip of width @xmath4 made of ideal dielectric walls , the grand - potential per unit length exhibits a universal finite - size correction equal to @xmath5 which is the same finite - size correction for a system confined in a strip made of ideal conductor walls .",
    "these finite - size corrections have been explained by noting that if one disregards microscopic detail the grand - partition function of a coulomb system is the inverse of the partition function of the gaussian model .    due to this analogy with the gaussian field theory , a coulomb system in a confined geometry",
    "is expected to exhibit logarithmic finite size - corrections , for instance in a disk of radius @xmath6 the grand - potential should have a correction @xmath7 .",
    "for the analogy with the gaussian field theory to be complete one should impose conformally invariant boundary conditions to the electric potential , for instance dirichlet boundary conditions ( ideal metallic walls ) or neumann boundary conditions ( ideal dielectric walls ) .",
    "the case of dirichlet boundary conditions was treated in reference  [ @xcite ] .    in this paper",
    "we study the two - component plasma at @xmath0 in a disk with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "one of the main motivations for this work is to show that the systems exhibits in fact the expected logarithmic finite - size correction .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in section 2 , we present the model and adapting the method of reference  [ @xcite ] we map the two - component plasma into a four - component free fermi field . in section 3 ,",
    "we compute the grand - potential and its large-@xmath6 expansion .",
    "we also compute the large-@xmath6 expansion of the free energy of the one - component plasma which was solved some time ago . in section 4 , we compute densities and correlation functions .",
    "the system is composed of two species of point - particles with opposite charges @xmath1 .",
    "the particles are confined in a disk @xmath8 of radius @xmath6 .",
    "it will be very useful to work with the complex coordinate @xmath9 of a point @xmath10 .",
    "the material outside the disk is supposed to be an ideal dielectric .",
    "this imposes neumann boundary conditions on the electric potential : the interaction potential @xmath11 between two charges located at @xmath10 and @xmath12 is the solution of poisson equation @xmath13 with neumann boundary conditions .",
    "however , it is well - known that any solution of poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) in a closed domain @xmath8 can not satisfy homogeneous neumann boundary conditions @xmath14 for @xmath15 , since gauss theorem implies that @xmath16 .",
    "a natural choice is to impose inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions to the potential @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the perimeter of the domain @xmath8 . in the case of the disk of radius @xmath6",
    "this gives @xmath19 this impossibility for the electric potential between pairs to obey homogeneous neumann boundary conditions is not a problem for a system globally neutral in which the total electric potential will satisfy homogeneous neumann boundary conditions if the pair potential satisfies  ( [ eq : neumannbc ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that for an infinite wall boundary it is possible for the electric potential between pairs to obey homogeneous neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the solution of poisson equation  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) with boundary conditions  ( [ eq : neumannbc ] ) in a disk can be obtained obtained by usual methods of electrostatics ( images , etc  ) .",
    "the solution is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some irrelevant length scale .",
    "it can be easily checked that solution  ( [ eq : potential ] ) can also be obtained as the limit of the boundary value problem where outside the disk there is a dielectric with dielectric constant @xmath22 ( up to some constant terms )",
    ".    it will be useful to introduce the image @xmath23 of a point @xmath10 by @xmath24 .",
    "the electric potential between pairs can then be written as @xmath25 and can be interpreted as the potential in @xmath10 due to a charge in @xmath12 and a image charge with equal sign and magnitude located at @xmath26 .    if the temperature is not high enough the two - dimensional two - component plasma is not well defined , this is due to the collapse between pairs of opposite sign .",
    "if the coupling constant @xmath3 the system is stable . here",
    "we will study the case @xmath0 . in order to avoid the collapse we will work initially with two interwoven lattices @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "positive particles with complex coordinates @xmath29 live in the sites of lattice @xmath27 and negative particles with complex coordinates @xmath30 live in the sites of @xmath28 .",
    "we shall work in the grand - canonical ensemble and will only consider neutral configurations .",
    "the boltzmann factor of a system with @xmath31 positive particles and @xmath31 negatives particles at @xmath0 is @xmath32 the first product corresponds to the self - energies of the particles and the other terms to the interactions between pairs . introducing the images this",

    "to compute explicitly the grand - potential from equation  ( [ eq : grand - potential ] ) we must find the eigenvalues of @xmath66 . from now on we will consider the continuum limit where the spacing of the lattices @xmath27 and @xmath28 goes to zero . in this limit",
    "it is natural to work with the re - scaled fugacity @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the area of a lattice cell .",
