    "for centuries physicists have wondered what happens at the origin of the reciprocal potential @xmath4 , which is ubiquitous and for example occurs in electromagnetism and gravitation . for a minimal scalar field obeying @xmath0 the situation is worse because @xmath5 where @xmath2 is a suitable differentiable function of the null coordinate @xmath3 , is a solution allowing creation of a reciprocal singularity out of nothing at the origin of the coordinates @xmath6 .",
    "the easiest way to avoid this problem is to say that minimal scalar theory breaks down and another theory is applicable to the problem at hand .",
    "there are a huge number of theories to choose from , for example born - infeld theory @xcite was created partially to avoid singularities at the origin . in quantum field theory",
    "the scalar field is usually quantized directly so it is hard to compare with the exact solution ( [ firsteq ] ) . in general relativity ( [ firsteq ] )",
    "was generalized in 1985 @xcite to a solution of the scalar - einstein equations : one can have solutions with @xmath7 of the same form",
    "but then one needs a compensating null radiation field , if the null radiation field is taken to vanish then one ends up with a simple scalar - einstein solution ; again one has a scalar field singularity at the origin of the coordinates and there is also a singularity of the spacetime curvature , and in this sense the situation is worse that ( [ firsteq ] ) because spacetime has also broken down .",
    "the scalar - einstein solution has at least six related applications . _",
    "firstly _ to cosmic censorship : it is known that in most cases static scalar - einstein spacetimes do not have event horizons @xcite and the existence of the solution shows that this is also the case in one particular instance in dynamic spacetimes .",
    "whether event horizons actually exist is now a matter of astrophysical observation @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ secondly _ to numerical models of gravitational collapse @xcite where it is a critical value between different behaviours .",
    "_ thirdly _ to quantum field theories on curved spacetimes where the scalar field can be equated to the field of the quantum field theory : whether this is an allowable method or not is undecided , in any case it turns out that there are many technical problems concerning whether objects such as the van vlech determinate converge fast enough . _",
    "fourthly _ to the hawking effect @xcite , can the exact solution scalar field be equated to scalar fields created in this , a related paper is @xcite , _ fifthly _ annihilation and creation operators , perhaps these in some way correspond to imploding and exploding fields ; usually these are defined on a fixed background however as geometry is related to matter there must be a simultaneous change in the gravitational field and perhaps a preferred graviton configuration , _ sixthly _ to canonical quantum gravity which is the subject of the present paper .",
    "it is common in physics to let algebraic expressions to become functions : however there is not an established word to describe this .",
    "when the algebraic expression is just a constant this is sometimes referred to as letting the object run , but here sometimes the algebraic expression is a constant times a variable .",
    "the words functionify and functionification do not appear in dictionaries so here the word relax is used to describe this process .",
    " [ ses ] describes the properties of the scalar - einstein solution needed here , in particular the original single null and double null forms are presented , brute force methods applied to these forms leads to two variable problems .",
    "the solution has two characteristic scalars : the scalar field and the homothetic killing potential , expressing the solution in terms of these leads to one variable problems . section ",
    "[ relaxk ] describes how to get a hamiltonian and quantize the system when the homothetic killing vector is relaxed , this can be pictured as what happens when there is one quantum degree of freedom introduced into the system corresponding to fluctuations in the homothetic killing vector away from its classical properties , classical fluctuation have been discussed by frolov @xcite",

    "the aharanov - bohm @xcite , @xcite not only shows the existence of the vector potential it also shows that the wavefunction is smooth rather than discontinuous at boundaries , and this justifies the preference of a smooth wavefunction here .",
    "_ secondly _ no boundary conditions on the quantum system are applied , these would cut down on the large number of constants in the solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ whittakersol ] ) , for present purposes these are unlikely to make a difference as we require existence not uniqueness . _",
    "thirdly _ no method of extracting information from the wavefunction has been given , so there is no method of recovering the curvature singularity from it , it might happen that any such method must itself be in some sense singular , _ fourthly _ the wavefunctions in the two regions can be combined and furthermore done so without considerations of phase . for large distances the wavefunctions ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ whittakersol ] ) are approximately trigonometric but it is not clear whether they peak and dip at the same time or not .",
    "the hamiltonian which is a linear combination of ( [ ham1 ] ) and ( [ rsham ] ) has a separable solution which is a product of ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ whittakersol ] ) ; explicitly @xmath100 has solution @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an amplitude constant , note ( [ solution ] ) is independent of @xmath103 .",
    "the above systems @xmath104 are not restricted to be either exploding or imploding , such restrictions might come from additional physical assumptions .",
    "the particle content corresponding to the above wave picture is not clear , it is not even clear if it at best corresponds to one or many particles : presumably the content is of a scalar field so configured that it cancels out the energy of gravitons , giving no overall energy which would agree with the classical case . for microscopic application to annihilation and creation operators",
    "the above hamiltonians @xmath104 could be the first step in finding out how spacetime changes .",
    "for macroscopic application to black holes and white holes again the hamiltonians could be a first step in solving the back reaction problem .",
    "our conclusion is that in the specific case studied here where classical spacetime has curvature singularities the quantum mechanical wavefunction can be finite , and that furthermore this is an indication of general behaviour .",
