    "in recent papers , we have deeply investigated the pulsational properties of classical cepheids on the basis of nonlinear , nonlocal and time - dependent convective pulsating models where the coupling between pulsation and convection is properly taken into account . from computations with three different chemical abundances ( @xmath8=0.25 , @xmath9=0.004 ; @xmath8=0.25 , @xmath9=0.008 ; @xmath8=0.28 , @xmath9=0.02 ) , chosen to properly cover cepheids observed both in the magellanic clouds and in the galaxy , the pulsation amplitude and the average magnitudes of the pulsators are obtained and several predicted relations , e.g. period - luminosity ( pl ) , period - color ( pc ) , period - luminosity - color ( plc ) and color - color ( cc ) , in the @xmath12 bands are provided . the discussion on the input physics and computing procedures , and the whole set of predicted relations , have been already presented ( see bono , marconi , & stellingwerf 1999a ; bono _ et al . _ 1999b ; bono , castellani , & marconi 2000a ; caputo , marconi & ripepi 1999 ; caputo , marconi , & musella 2000a ; caputo _ et al . _",
    "2000b ) and are not repeated . here",
    "we wish only to remark that both the slope and zero - point of the predicted pl relations turn out to depend on metallicity in the sense that metal - rich pulsators follow shallower pl relations and are on average fainter , for fixed period , than metal - poor ones .    on this basis ,",
    "the metallicity correction to a true distance modulus @xmath13 determined from cepheid pl relations at the lmc has been evaluated ( caputo _ et al . _",
    "2000b ) as given by @xmath14log@xmath150.27 mag dex@xmath16 , where @xmath2log@xmath9 is the difference between the metallicity of the cepheids whose distance we are estimating and the lmc value ( @xmath17 0.008 , see luck _ et al .",
    "this result disagrees with earlier observational clues based on the analysis of cepheids in different fields of m31 ( freedman & madore 1990 ) and m101 ( kennicutt _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , which suggest an opposite metallicity effect on distance determinations ( see also kochanek 1997 ; sasselov _ et al .",
    "following kennicutt _",
    "( 1998 ) , the metallicity correction is @xmath14[o / h]@xmath3 + 0.24 mag dex@xmath16 , where @xmath2[o / h ] is the difference between the oxygen abundance of the cepheid field and the lmc value ( [ o / h]@xmath18.40 , see pagel _",
    "et al . _ 1978 ) .",
    "more recently , the revised procedures of the hst key project ( freedman _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) adopt a correction of @xmath190.2 mag dex@xmath16 .",
    "it should be noted that the empirical corrections have been estimated by forcing the slope of the cepheid pl relations at different wavelengths to be that observed for the lmc . since the pulsating models suggest that also the slope depends on the pulsator metallicity , we might suspect some systematic errors in the attempt of disentangling reddening from metallicity effects .",
    "we add that recent empirical studies on galactic cepheids seem to support the theoretical results . according to groenewegen & oudmaijer ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 data of 236 cepheids from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue do not exclude shallower pl relations than that observed for lmc cepheids .",
    "moreover , the @xmath20 and @xmath22 data of cepheids in the galactic open clusters with main sequence fitted distances ( hoyle , shanks , & tanvir 2000 ) do suggest pl@xmath23 and pl@xmath24 slopes of @xmath252.1 and @xmath252.82 , respectively , significantly flatter than the canonical lmc values of @xmath262.76 ( freedman _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) and @xmath263.44 ( laney & stobie 1994 ) .    in any case , even though the lmc distance is the benchmark of the cepheid - calibrated distance scale , it would be reasonable to expect that the next most important role might be played by the metallicity of the observed cepheids .",
    "we note that the oxygen abundance of distant galaxies with hst observations of cepheids is on average @xmath30.5 dex higher than that of lmc .",
    "thus , ignoring the metallicity effect might lead to neglect corrections of @xmath270.1 mag ( theoretical ) or @xmath280.1 mag ( empirical ) to lmc - based distance moduli , with not dramatic but significant consequences on the value of the hubble constant @xmath29 .",
    "in this context , hst observations of cepheids in the spiral galaxy ngc 4258 ( maoz _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) appear of great importance since the distance to this galaxy has been accurately determined from direct measurements of the orbital motions of water maser sources ( herrnstein _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , providing a stringent geometrical test for both the hst key project calibration and the pulsation models .    in the following sect .",
    "2 we derive the distance to ngc 4258 relative to lmc , adopting the results of pulsating models , and we compare our _ `` pulsational '' _ estimates with those based upon empirical cepheid relations .",
    "the discussion on the absolute distance to ngc 4258 and lmc is presented in sect .",
    "3 , while some final comments on future work close the paper .",
    "the revised key project method ( freedman _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) is based on the pl relations of fundamental cepheids    @xmath30 @xmath31    where the slopes are inferred from the huge sample of lmc cepheids in the ogleii catalogue ( udalski _ et al . _ 1999 ) , @xmath32 is the period in days , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are intensity - averaged mean absolute magnitudes for an assumed lmc true distance modulus of 18.50 mag .    in the key project methodology , the difference in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 apparent distance moduli derived by fitting the above equations to the observed magnitudes of cepheids gives the average value of @xmath35 .",
    "adopting for the absorption in the @xmath20-band @xmath36=2.45@xmath35 from the cardelli _",
    "( 1989 ) reddening law , the extinction - corrected distance modulus @xmath13 is derived . according to newman _",
    "( 2001 , hereafter n2001 ) , @xmath20 and @xmath21 data of cepheids in ngc 4258 lead to @xmath37=29.40@xmath10.09 mag ( total random error ) , namely to a distance modulus larger than the lmc value by 10.90 mag .",
    "the key project method is equivalent to combining @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes to form the reddening - free wesenheit quantities @xmath38 , and fitting them with a linear relation to the period .",
    "( 1999 ) , using a slightly different extinction curve which yields @xmath36=2.55@xmath35 , find that the wesenheit - pl ( hereafter wpl ) relation of lmc cepheids in the ogleii catalogue is    @xmath39 with a standard deviation of 0.08 mag .",
    "using this empirical wpl relation for the hst magnitudes of ngc 4258 cepheids listed in n2001 and adopting @xmath5=18.50 mag , we derive that the cepheid distance to this galaxy is @xmath37=29.42 @xmath10.09 mag ( random error)@xmath10.08 mag ( standard deviation on wpl relation ) , in agreement with the key project result .",
    "let us now consider that the oxygen abundance adopted by n2001 for the hst fields in ngc 4258 is [ o / h]=@xmath400.06 , which is 0.35 dex higher than that for the lmc cepheids . in accordance with freedman _",
    "( 2001 ) , the correction to the cepheid distance modulus , as based upon current observational results , is 0.2@xmath10.2 mag dex@xmath16 .",
    "this yields that the distance modulus we have derived for the cepheids in ngc 4258 must be increased by 0.07@xmath1 0.07 mag .",
    "in conclusion of this part of discussion , given the well known debate on the lmc distance ( see later ) , we can state that the cepheid distance to ngc 4258 , as inferred from lmc - based pl or wpl relations and _ empirical _ metallicity correction on the cepheid distance scale , is given by    @xmath41      concerning the results of pulsating models , let us first compare the above empirical pl and wpl relations with the predicted ones for fundamental pulsators with @xmath9=0.008 and @xmath9=0.02 .    in previous papers ( e.g. bono _ et al .",
    "_ 1999b ; caputo et al .",
    "2000a ) , we have already shown that moving toward the shorter wavelengths the @xmath42-log@xmath32 distribution of fundamental pulsators with mass larger than 5@xmath43 , i.e. period longer than @xmath3 3 days , is much better represented by a quadratic relation ( @xmath44 ) . however , if only periods shorter than log@xmath32=1.5 ( as observed in the lmc ) are considered in the final fit , then reliable linear solutions may be obtained . as for the @xmath45 quantities , the predicted distributions with period",
    "are well represented by linear solutions over the whole range 0.5@xmath46log@xmath472.0 .",
    "the values of the coefficients of the theoretical @xmath48 pl and wpl relations are given in table 1 .",
    "one finds that the slope of the predicted linear pl@xmath23 and pl@xmath49 relations with @xmath9=0.008 ( @xmath500.02 and @xmath510.01 , respectively ) are in very good agreement with that provided by lmc cepheids [ see eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) ] .",
    "a fair agreement is also present between the empirical ( @xmath52 ) and the predicted slope ( @xmath530.04 ) of the wpl relation with @xmath9=0.008 .",
    "concerning the zero - points , one finds a very close agreement in the @xmath21-band [ @xmath540.01 versus @xmath550.01 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] , whereas the predicted linear pl@xmath23 relation with @xmath9=0.008 is fainter by @xmath3 0.09 mag than eq .",
    "( 1 ) . following the key project procedure , this yields that the theoretical pl relations would give a larger @xmath13 than 18.50 mag .",
    "this results also if the wesenheit quantities are considered : at log@xmath32=1 , the predicted wpl relation with @xmath9=0.008 gives a reddening - corrected magnitude of @xmath560.11 mag , whereas from eq .",
    "( 3 ) one has @xmath570.08 mag , with @xmath5=18.50 mag .",
    "in fact , when the predicted wpl relation with @xmath9=0.008 is applied to the lmc cepheids provided by the ogleii microlensing survey ( udalski _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , we find @xmath5=18.71@xmath10.10 mag ( random error)@xmath10.10 mag ( intrinsic dispersion of the theoretical wpl relation , caputo _ et al . _",
    "2000a ) , which is 0.2 mag larger than the key project adopted value .",
    "such a difference of 0.2 mag in the true distance modulus remains when the observed @xmath20 and @xmath21 data of cepheids in ngc 4258 are taken into consideration .",
    "based on the predicted wpl relation with @xmath9=0.008 , we get @xmath580.09 mag ( random error)@xmath10.10 mag ( intrinsic dispersion of the theoretical wpl relation ) .    in conclusion , both empirical lmc - based and theoretical wpl relations confirm that the true distance modulus of ngc 4258 is larger than the lmc value by 10.92 mag , _ on condition that the cepheids in ngc 4258 have the same metallicity as for the lmc .",
    "_    however , the pulsating models suggest that for fixed period the metal - rich pulsators are generally fainter than metal - poor ones , with the difference in luminosity increasing towards the longer periods . as a consequence ,",
    "if a higher metal content is adopted , then the true distance modulus inferred from the predicted relations should decrease , with the effect of metallicity increasing as the average period of the cepheid sample moves towards longer periods .",
    "in fact , for the typical value of galactic cepheids , i.e. @xmath9=0.02 , we determine @xmath590.14 mag ( total error ) and @xmath600.14 mag .",
    "eventually , in accordance with the current oxygen abundance estimates for lmc ( [ o / h]@xmath250.4 ) and ngc 4258 ( [ o / h]=@xmath400.06 ) , adopting @xmath2log@xmath9=@xmath2[o / h ] and interpolating between the @xmath9=0.008 and @xmath9=0.02 results for ngc 4258 , we derive that the predicted _ metallicity - corrected _ cepheid distance modulus of ngc 4258 is given by    @xmath61    which is 0.17 mag lower than the value determined with the empirical metallicity correction [ see eq .",
    "( 4 ) ] , _ for any adopted lmc distance .",
    "according to herrnstein _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) , very - long - baseline - interferometry observations of the ngc 4258 maser provide the way to determine a metric distance of 7.2@xmath10.5 mpc , as inferred from simple geometric considerations of the speed and motions of the maser .",
    "this number , corresponding to a true distance modulus @xmath37=29.28@xmath10.15 mag , appears the most accurate distance to faraway galaxies so far measured .    as for the cepheid distance , its determination via eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq . ( 5 ) requires the knowledge of the absolute distance to the lmc .",
    "given the well known controversy between _ short _ and _ long _ distance scale , let us refer to the excellent reviews by walker ( 1999 ) and carretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) which provide a synthesis of lmc distance determinations .    as a whole",
    "( see also fig . 1 in clementini et al . 2000 ) , the various distance indicators suggest a distance modulus in the range of @xmath3 18.3 mag to @xmath3 18.7 mag and , according to the authors , they seem to converge on 18.54@xmath10.07 mag ( carretta et al .",
    "2000 ) or 18.50@xmath10.07 ( clementini et al",
    ". 2000 ) .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 we show how any change in the lmc distance will affect the determination of the cepheid distance to ngc 4258 . by inserting @xmath100.10 mag into eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we derive a cepheid distance of 7.9@xmath10.6 mpc ( empirical metallicity correction ) and 7.3@xmath10.6 mpc ( theoretical metallicity correction ) , which are 1.2 @xmath6 and 0.2@xmath6 , respectively , from the maser determination .",
    "since asserting the true distance to the lmc is a tricky matter to handle , also in consideration of the consequent calibration of secondary distance indicators and measurement of the hubble constant , let us turn the problem around , so that the maser distance to ngc 4258 is used to recalibrate the cepheid brightness .",
    "as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "1 , the agreement within 1@xmath6 between the cepheid and the maser distance to ngc 4258 requires @xmath5 in the range of 18.15@xmath2618.45 mag or 18.35@xmath2618.60 , depending on whether the empirical or theoretical metallicity correction is adopted .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that , if the maser distance to ngc4258 is adopted to recalibrate the cepheid pl relations , then the predictions of pulsation models appear more suitable , in comparison with the results of empirical pl relations and metallicity correction , to account for our current knowledge of the lmc distance , supporting a distance modulus close to 18.50 mag",
    ".    however , we can not fail to mention that such a value appears lower than the number ( 18.7@xmath10.1 mag ) suggested both by _ hipparcos _ parallaxes of galactic cepheids ( see feast 1999 ) and the pulsating models with @xmath9=0.008 ( see sect .",
    "2 ) .    on the observational side",
    ", we can note that the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes could not fix the star magnitudes to the few percent accuracy that is desirable .",
    "moreover , groenewegen & oudmaijer ( 2000 ) find that the pl relation in the @xmath62band gives a shorter lmc distance than @xmath48 relations , and the difference can be as large as @xmath3 0.2 mag .    on the theoretical side",
    ", even though our pulsating models adopt the most updated physics , there are still several systematic uncertainties due to the adopted ratio @xmath63 , adopted mass - luminosity relation , bolometric corrections and temperature - color transformations .",
    "the chemical compositions of the models were fixed following a primordial helium content @xmath64=0.23 and @xmath65 2.5 . in order to scrutinize the effect of helium , new computations",
    "have been performed adopting a higher ratio ( @xmath3 4 ) .",
    "preliminary results with @xmath8=0.31 and @xmath9=0.02 ( fiorentino 2001 , degree thesis ) show that an increased @xmath63 might reduce the metallicity effect on cepheid pl relations .",
    "the adopted mass - luminosity relation for pulsation models is based on the canonical ( no overshooting ) evolutionary computations by castellani , chieffi , & straniero ( 1992 ) .",
    "taking into account the most updated canonical mass - luminosity relation provided by bono _",
    "( 2000b ) , the expected bolometric magnitude differences , at fixed mass , range from 0.08 to 0.25 mag depending on the stellar mass .",
    "however , as discussed in bono _",
    "( 1999b ) , the mild overshooting models , which are brighter by 0.62 mag than the canonical ones , at fixed mass , would give rather similar pl relations , at least with log@xmath47 1.8 . as a whole ,",
    "the adopted mass / luminosity relations seem to play a minor role in determining the pulsational properties of cepheids .",
    "concerning model atmospheres , the results presented in this paper rely on bolometric corrections and colors by castelli , gratton , & kurucz ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "the comparison of the adopted @xmath66 colors for solar metallicity with the more updated evaluations by bessell , castelli , & plez ( 1998a , b ) shows that differences are negligible .    the remaining source of uncertainty in pulsation models deals with the treatment of convection and in particular the mixing length parameter ( @xmath67 ) adopted to close the non linear equation system ( see bono & stellingwerf 1994 for details ) .",
    "the topology of the instability strip is affected by the @xmath67 parameter in the sense that the strip narrows as @xmath67 increases , with a larger effect on the red boundary ( up to 300 k for an increase of 0.3 in the @xmath67 parameter ) . since the pl relations sensitively depend on the edges of the pulsation region ( i.e. the distribution of pulsators within the instability strip ) , variations of the @xmath67 parameter could in principle affect the pl relation coefficients , but with minor effects on the wpl relation ( see fig . 12 in caputo",
    "_ et al . _",
    "however , the dependence of convective efficiency on metal abundance might alter the metallicity effect on the cepheid pulsation properties .",
    "important clues on this critical issue are expected from the comparison between observed and modeled morphology of light and radial velocity curves ( bono _ et al . _ in preparation ; see also bono , castellani , & marconi 2000c ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we can not exclude that future refinements in pulsating models and more accurate parallaxes of galactic cepheids might lead to a lmc true distance modulus close to 18.50@xmath10.10 mag , the value which is suggested by empirical non - cepheid methods .",
    "one agrees that all the above discussion is based upon the assumption that the maser distance to ngc 4258 is correct .",
    "as presently we can rely on this unique maser distance , we hope that in the next future such a promising technique would increase the number of distance determinations to external galaxies with cepheid observations .",
    "this seems fundamental for testing the whole pulsational scenario , as well as for setting the distance to lmc .",

    "<S> one might argue that these results are suggesting that a smaller distance to the lmc , @xmath7 18.3 mag , should be used to calibrate the cepheid brightness ( see , e.g. , paczynski 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , even though the well known controversy between _ short _ and _ long _ distance scale is far from being settled and current determinations of the lmc distance modulus are spanning @xmath3 0.4 mag , it seems that the various empirical methods converge on the value adopted by the key project ( see carretta et al . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the metallicity correction on cepheid distance determinations , as suggested by pulsation models with three different chemical abundances ( @xmath8=0.25 , @xmath9=0.004 ; @xmath8=0.25 , @xmath9=0.008 ; @xmath8=0.28 , @xmath9=0.02 ) , might provide the natural way of reaching a close agreement between cepheid and maser distance to ngc 4258 for a wide variety of lmc distance determinations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , by adopting @xmath100.10 mag we derive a cepheid distance of 7.3@xmath10.6 mpc which is only 0.2@xmath6 from the maser determination , while using @xmath110.10 mag or 18.40@xmath10.10 the cepheid and maser distances are 0.8@xmath6 and 0.4@xmath6 , respectively , apart . </S>"
