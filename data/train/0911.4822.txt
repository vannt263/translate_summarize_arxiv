    "distributions of matter in form of shells have been a useful tool in astrophysics and general relativity , often providing simplified but analytically tractable models in cosmology , gravitational collapse and supernovae . in general relativity ,",
    "the pioneering work on constructing solutions of the einstein field equations representing shells was done by israel @xcite . in his formalism , the shells are constructed by joining two manifolds across a three - dimensional time - like surface , and the matter representing the shell is interpreted as a discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature on the surface .",
    "this formalism has been used to study several models of relativistic shells . @xcite",
    "give a brief review of some of these models and also discuss shells which admit closed equations of state , including non - linear polytropic models .",
    "an exact solution of a static shell surrounding a black hole was obtained by @xcite , and the stability of such a configuration against radial perturbations was studied by @xcite , while non - radial perturbations were analysed by @xcite .",
    "non - radial perturbations of self - gravitating static fluid shells in the newtonian gravity were studied by @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a newtonian analytical potential - density pair that represents a family of spherical shells with varying thickness .",
    "for this potential , we calculate the rotation curves of test particles and make a first study of stability of the shells by considering the stability of circular orbits of the test particles .",
    "this is done in section [ sec_ns ] . in section [ sec_gr ]",
    ", we consider a general relativistic version of the newtonian shells . for this task , we employ a particular isotropic form of a metric in spherical coordinates .",
    "we calculate the components of the energy - momentum tensor of the shell s matter and also analyse the geodesic circular motion of test particles and discuss their stability .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_dis ] we summarize our results .",
    "in this section , we present a simple potential - density pair that describes a family of spherical shells of matter",
    ". we shall consider the following potential : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a parameter with dimensions of length and @xmath2 is a non - negative integer . by using the poisson equation in spherical coordinates ,",
    "@xmath3 one obtains a mass density given by @xmath4 for @xmath5 , the pair ( [ eq_phi_n ] ) and ( [ eq_rho_n ] ) is reduced to the plummer model @xcite that has a monotone decreasing density profile .",
    "however , for @xmath6 the density vanishes on @xmath7 and thus we have a shell - like distribution of matter . fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows some curves of the dimensionless mass density @xmath8 as function of @xmath9 for @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for higher values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the mass density becomes more concentrated ( thinner shell ) , with maximum at @xmath13 for large values of @xmath14 , the density ( [ eq_phi_n ] ) decays as @xmath15 , thus very fast for large @xmath2 , as can be seen in fig .",

    "the stability of circular orbits can be determined using the rayleigh criterion of stability for a rotating fluid ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and that can be adapted to study circular orbits of test particles in self - gravitating systems ( see e.  g.   @xcite for an application of the rayleigh criterion of stability in general relativity ) .",
    "the condition for a stable orbit is @xmath21 using equation ( [ eq_h_n ] ) , it is straigthforward to check that the orbits are always stable .",
    "it is instructive to consider the limit @xmath22 . in this case",
    ", we have an infinitesimal thin shell on @xmath23 , and the limits of the potential ( [ eq_phi_n ] ) and circular velocity ( [ eq_vc_n ] ) are @xmath24 thus , for @xmath25 the potential is constant and a test particle is at rest inside the shell , and if @xmath26 the shell exerts on the test particle the same gravitational force as a point mass located on @xmath7 , in agreement with newton s shell theorem .",
    "now , we study a general relativistic version of the newtonian potential - density pair discussed in the previous section . for this , it is convenient to choose a particular metric in isotropic form in spherical coordinates @xmath27 , which we write as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . in this particular form of metric",
    ", the schwarzschild solution is given by @xmath30 .",
    "a similar form of the metric ( [ eq_metric ] ) in cylindrical coordinates was used by @xcite to construct general relativistic versions of newtonian models for distributions of matter in galaxies .    for metric ( [ eq_metric ] ) ,",
