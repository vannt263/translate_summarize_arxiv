    "<S> graber , harris and starr proved , when @xmath0 , the irreducibility of the hurwitz space @xmath1 which parametrizes degree @xmath2 coverings of a smooth , projective curve @xmath3 of genus @xmath4 , simply branched in @xmath5 points , with full monodromy group @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we sharpen this result and prove that @xmath1 is irreducible if @xmath7 and in the case of elliptic @xmath3 if @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> we prove that the corresponding hurwitz space is irreducible if the number of simply branched points is @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we study also simply branched coverings with monodromy group @xmath10 and when @xmath5 is large enough determine the corresponding connected components of @xmath11 . </S>",
