    "regular satellites of giant planets have nearly circular and coplanar prograde orbits , and are thought to have formed in circumplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "gas and solids are supplied into the circumplanetary disk from the vicinity of the giant planet s orbit in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "@xcite proposed the so - called gas - starved disk model for the formation of regular satellites of giant planets , where the satellites are formed in a waning circumplanetary disk at the very end stage of giant planet formation . @xcite",
    "performed n - body simulation of satellite formation based on the above model , and showed that mass fraction of satellite system relative to the host planet is regulated to @xmath0 , which is consistent with observations .",
    "later studies revised this model and tried to explain the difference between the satellite systems of jupiter and saturn @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called solid enhanced minimum mass disk model proposed by @xcite considers a circumplanetary disk consisting of two different parts of surface density in order to explain the rock - ice ratio of the galilean satellites .",
    "recently , satellite formation based on this model was examined semi - analytically @xcite . although growth and orbital evolution of satellites in the circumplanetary disk have been investigated in detail by these works ,",
    "the distribution of solid materials that are building blocks of satellites in circumplanetary disks has been poorly understood .",
    "there are two kinds of processes for the supply of solid materials into circumplanetary disks .",
    "if incoming bodies are sufficiently small to be coupled with the gas flow , they are brought to the circumplanetary disk with the gas inflow from the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined capture process of solid materials with various sizes , using results of hydrodynamic simulations of gas flow around a growing giant planet @xcite and three - body orbital integration .",
    "they found that accretion efficiency of dust - size particles initially on circular orbits is rather low when the gas surface density of the protoplanetary disk is that of the minimum mass nebula model .",
    "they also found that such small solid bodies can be supplied to the circumplanetary disk when the gas surface density becomes smaller as a results of disk dispersal .",
    "another process for the supply of solid bodies is capture of planetesimals by gas drag from the circumplanetary disk @xcite . in the case of large planetesimals that are decoupled from the gas flow ,",
    "effects of gas drag on their orbits become significant only when they pass through the dense part of the circumplanetary disk in the vicinity of the planet . @xcite",
    "performed three - body orbital integrations and examined capture of planetesimals from their heliocentric orbits into the circumplanetary disk .",
    "they found that planetesimals approaching the circumplanetary disk in the retrograde direction ( i.e. , in the direction opposite to the motion of the gas in the disk ) are more easily captured by gas drag owing to the larger velocity relative to the gas .",
    "they also found that capture rates decrease with increasing size of planetesimals because strong gas drag is needed to capture large ones ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite examined orbital evolution of planetesimals in the vicinity of jupiter s orbit , using global orbital integration including gas drag , disruption via ram pressure , and mass loss through ablation .",
    "they found that planetesimals are captured from both interior and exterior orbits .",
    "although they also show the distribution of orbital elements of captured planetesimals in the circumjovian disk , they did not examine their orbital evolution in the disk .",
    "recently , we examined the capture and subsequent orbital evolution of planetesimals that are decoupled from the gas flow in circumplanetary gas disks using three - body orbital integration . in @xcite , we investigated the orbital evolution and the distribution of orbital elements of planetesimals captured by relatively strong gas drag , where planetesimals lose sufficient amount of energy to become captured in a single encounter with the planet . on the other hand , in @xcite , we examined the capture and subsequent orbital evolution of irregular satellites in waning circumplanetary gas disks .",
    "we found that irregular satellites are easily captured and are likely to survive when the gas drag is strong and the disk dispersal takes place in a short timescale .",
    "however , in these works , radial distribution of solid materials in the circumplanetary disk was not studied in detail .",
    "furthermore , the abundance of captured planetesimal - size bodies relative to dust - size particles in the circumplanetary disk is important to understand which solid materials mainly contribute to the growth of regular satellites . the distribution and size of solid materials in the circumplanetary disk would also influence the timescale of satellite accretion and their chemical composition such as the ice - rock ratio @xcite .    in the present work , as an extension of our recent works",

    "we obtain distribution of the surface number density of captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk . in section  [ sec : num ] , we describe basic equations , disk model , and numerical methods used in the present work .",
    "we show dynamical evolution and distribution of planetesimals captured from heliocentric circular orbits in section  [ sec : cir ] . in section  [",

    "section  [ sec : sum ] summarizes our results .",
    "we consider a local coordinate system ( @xmath1 ) centered on a planet ( figure  [ fig : simu ] ) .",
    "we assume that the planet ( @xmath2 ) is on a circular orbit with semi - major axis @xmath3 , and is embedded in a disk of planetesimals .",
    "also , the planet is assumed to have a circumplanetary gas disk , whose mid - plane coincides with the planet s orbital plane . in the present work ,",
    "we assume a disk of equal - mass planetesimals ( @xmath4 ) , and neglect gravitational interaction among them . at azimuthal locations far from the planet ,",
    "planetesimals are assumed to have uniform radial distribution .",
    "planetesimals are supplied through the azimuthal boundaries at @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the planet s hill radius ; @xmath7 ) , which is sufficiently far from the planet to neglect its gravitational effect .",
    "supplied planetesimals are assumed to be distributed radially uniformly in the protoplanetary disk ; we examine the effect of non - uniform radial distribution in section [ sec : eigap ] .",
    "we integrate the orbits of planetesimals by solving hill s equation with the effect of gas drag from the circumplanetary disk .",
    "the motion of the planetesimal is expressed as @xcite , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the planet s orbital angular frequency , and @xmath10 is the distance between the centers of the planet and the planetesimal .",
    "@xmath11 is the acceleration due to the gas drag force @xmath12 given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the drag coefficient ( we assume @xmath15 ; appendix a ) , @xmath16 is the radius of the planetesimal , @xmath17 is the gas density , and @xmath18 is the velocity of the planetesimal relative to the gas .",
    "we scale the distance by mutual hill radius @xmath6 and time by @xmath19 .",
    "then , we can express the above equation of motion in a non - dimensional form as @xmath20 where tildes denote non - dimensional quantities .",
    "the non - dimensional acceleration due to gas drag can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the internal density of planetesimals .",
    "when the gas drag can be neglected , we can confirm from equation  ( [ eq : hillgas_non ] ) the conservation of energy given as @xmath23 with @xmath24 we remove planetesimals when their distance from the planet becomes sufficiently large or when collision with the planet is detected .",
    "we assume that the physical size of the planet ( @xmath25 ) relative to its hill radius , @xmath26 , is @xmath27 , which corresponds to the physical size of a planet at jupiter s orbit .    the number of planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk increases due to capture by gas drag and decreases due to collision with the planet after orbital decay .",
    "however , as we will show below , the number reaches an equilibrium state by a balance between continuous capture of planetesimals and loss to the planet due to orbital decay .",
    "since the timescale needed to reach a quasi - steady state depends on the dynamical properties of planetesimals and the strength of gas drag , we perform orbital integration for a sufficiently long period of time ( @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the orbital period of the planet ) .",
    "unperturbed surface number density of the planetesimal disk @xmath30 is one of the important parameters in order to determine the distribution of captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk .",
    "thus , we briefly estimate the value of @xmath30 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath30 when we set the solid surface density in the protoplanetary disk @xmath31 and the mass of the planetesimal @xmath32 ( recall that we assume equal - sized planetesimals ) . if we adopt the minimum mass solar nebula model @xcite , the surface density of solids in the protoplanetary disk is @xmath33 g@xmath34 g@xmath35 at the orbit of jupiter ( @xmath36 is the hill radius of jupiter ) . in the present work",
    ", we will examine the distribution of captured planetesimals in circumplanetary disks for cases with a wide range of planetesimal sizes ( @xmath37 m ) .",
    "if we assume that the size of the planetesimal is @xmath38 m , the surface number density scaled by the hill radius of jupiter can be written by @xmath39 @xmath35 . however ,",
    "if we adopt such a realistic surface number density , the number of orbits to integrate per one timestep is @xmath40 ( even if we assume a large size of planetesimals to reduce the surface number density to be @xmath41 , we have to integrate @xmath42 orbits ) . here , we should recall that we neglect mutual gravity between planetesimals , thus their orbits are not influenced by the choice of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we adopt a value of @xmath43 feasible for our simulation ( typically , @xmath44 ) , and discuss the enhancement of the surface number density in the circumplanetary disk relative to the background value . for the case of planetesimals initially on circular orbits , and is @xmath45 orbits for the case of planetesimals initially on eccentric and inclined orbits . we confirmed that the surface number density of captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk is unchanged when @xmath43 is increased to 1000 .",
    "therefore , the above value of @xmath43 is sufficiently large to accurately obtain the distribution of captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk . ]      for those planetesimals that are large enough to be decoupled from the inflowing gas , gas drag from the circumplanetary disk becomes important only when they pass through the dense part of the disk in the vicinity of the planet , where the gas distribution can be approximated to be axisymmetric @xcite .",
    "thus , in the present work , we assume that the radial distribution of the gas density of the circumplanetary disk is axisymmetric , its radial dependence is given by a power law , and its vertical structure is isothermal . under these assumptions , the gas density can be written by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the scale height of the circumplanetary disk ( @xmath48 is the keplerian orbital frequency around the planet ) , and @xmath49 are the gas surface density and sound velocity , respectively , with @xmath50 being the horizontal distance from the planet in the mid - plane . in the above",
    ", @xmath51 is a typical length scale roughly corresponding to the effective size of the circumplanetary disk , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the surface density and sound velocity at that radial location . in our calculations",

    "because the gas density decreases rapidly with increasing distance from the planet , this assumption on gas drag does not affect results of our calculations .",
    "gas elements in the disk are assumed to rotate in circular orbits around the planet with a velocity slightly lower than the keplerian velocity due to radial pressure gradient , i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the keplerian velocity around the planet at the radial location considered . using equations ( [ eq : rhodis ] ) and ( [ eq : snum_svelo ] )",

    "this leads to smaller capture rates , while the lifetime of captured bodies in the circumplanetary disk becomes longer . as a result",
    ", the influence of the material density on the radial distribution of captured bodies is expected to be small . ]",

    "for the above fiducial values of @xmath14 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , the relation between @xmath66 and the planetesimal size @xmath16 can be written as ( see * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ fig : xy_flow](a ) shows the distribution of planetesimals in the vicinity of the planet .",
    "most of planetesimals are scattered by the gravity of the planet or pass by the planet s hill sphere , while some of them enter the hill sphere .",
    "planetesimals that enter the planet s hill sphere are affected by gas drag from the circumplanetary gas disk , and those planetesimals that lose a sufficient amount of energy become permanently captured ( figure  [ fig : xy_flow](b ) ) . in figure",

    "figure  [ fig : xy_flow](c ) and ( d ) show blow - ups of the distribution in the vicinity of the planet . typically , those captured into retrograde orbits tend to have larger velocity relative to the gas than those on prograde orbits .",
    "thus , planetesimals in retrograde orbits spiral into the planet more quickly , and the innermost part of the circumplanetary disk is dominated by planetesimals captured into prograde orbits ( figure  [ fig : xy_flow](d ) ) . also , free planetesimals rarely exist in the vicinity of the planet ,",
    "because they become permanently captured by strong gas drag in such a dense part of the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : tncap_6 ] shows evolution of the number of planetesimals permanently captured within the planet s hill sphere for the case shown figure  [ fig : xy_flow ] .",
    "the red curve represents the total number of captured planetesimals .",
    "the number of captured planetesimals @xmath79 can be determined by a balance between the increase by the capture of planetesimals and the decrease due to collision with the planet after orbital decay .",
    "we find that the total number first increases gradually until @xmath80 due to capture of planetesimals .",
    "after @xmath81 , the system reaches an equilibrium state with @xmath82 . in an unperturbed state without the planet and the circumplanetary disk , the number of planetesimals passing within the planet s hill sphere is @xmath83 when @xmath44 . also , the number of free planetesimals within the hill sphere is about 1200 in this case .",
    "thus , the number density of planetesimals within the hill sphere is significantly enhanced due to the effects of the planet and the disk .",
    "the blue and green lines represent the number of planetesimals permanently captured in the prograde direction and the retrograde direction , respectively .",
    "we find that the number of planetesimals captured in retrograde orbits is significantly smaller because of their rapid orbital decay into the planet .    on close inspection of figure",
    "[ fig : tncap_6 ] , we find that the number of bodies captured in prograde orbits increases very rapidly at the very beginning ( @xmath84 ) , and then its growth rate slows down and continues gradual increase at @xmath85 .",
    "the rapid increase in the first stage is due to capture of bodies in a single encounter with the planet ( figure  [ fig : cap_orbit ] ; red and green lines ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the gradual increase in the second stage comes from a different type of capture orbits , which maintain larger pericenter distance and survive longer in the disk ( figure  [ fig : cap_orbit ] , blue line ) . dynamical behavior of these orbits is described in more detail in appendix b.      figure  [ fig : rns_6 ] shows the surface number density of captured planetesimals @xmath86 scaled by the background surface number density @xmath30 , as a function of their radial distance from the planet .",
    "these plots are created by averaging the distributions at different times after the system reached the equilibrium state .",
    "the distribution of planetesimals captured into prograde orbits ( blue line ) show different slopes depending on the radial distance . in the outer region with @xmath87 , the distribution can be roughly approximated by a power law @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "then , with decreasing distance , the slope becomes steeper ( @xmath90 ) at @xmath91 , and then the distribution levels off at @xmath92 . with further decreasing distance",
    ", it increases again and , finally , levels off again at @xmath93 .",
    "we find that the above behavior of the surface number density distribution reflects dynamical evolution of captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk .",
    "those captured by a single encounter with the dense part of the gas disk accumulate in the vicinity of the planet and are short - lived because of rapid orbital decay , while those captured in the outer part are typically long - lived , with their pericenter avoiding penetration into the dense part of the disk . captured bodies in the outer part ( @xmath94 ) are dominated by the latter long - lived ones . immediately after being captured , their orbits decay rather rapidly due to large orbital eccentricities ; this corresponds to the region with @xmath89 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "then , their eccentricities are damped by gas drag and orbits become nearly circular .",
    "then the rate of orbital decay decreases @xcite ; the region with the steeper slope with @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) corresponds to such slowly migrating bodies on the relatively long - lived orbits . with further decreasing radial distance",
    ", the rate of orbital decay increases because of higher gas density , which leads to the nearly flat distribution at @xmath95 .",
    "on the other hand , the increase of the surface number density in the inner region ( @xmath96 ) is caused by planetesimals captured into short - lived orbits ( the red and green lines in figure  [ fig : cap_orbit ] ) .",
    "in fact , the outer boundary of this region roughly corresponds to the prograde capture radius where planetesimals can be captured by a single passage through the gas disk @xcite .",
    "since such captured planetesimals spiral into the planet quickly due to strong gas drag ( appendix b ) , the surface number density distribution becomes nearly flat at @xmath97 .",
    "the distribution of planetesimals captured into retrograde orbits can be divided into two regions : the outer region at @xmath94 , where the distribution can be approximated by a single power - law with @xmath98 , and the inner region with nearly flat distribution . in the outer region , bodies are captured into relatively long - lived orbits but migrate inward more rapidly than the prograde ones in the same region due to strong headwind . owing to rapid orbital decay , the distribution levels off inside the critical radius for capture into retrograde orbits by a single encounter ( @xcite ; green vertical dashed line ) .",
    "we also plot the distribution of free planetesimals for comparison . although its surface number density is slightly enhanced due to the effect of the planet s gravitational focusing , it is comparable to the surface number density of the background unperturbed planetesimal disk ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the surface number density of free planetesimals vanishes inside the prograde capture radius ( @xmath99 ) , because planetesimals become permanently captured in that region due to gas drag .",
    "next , we examine the dependence of the distribution of captured planetesimals on the size of planetesimals , by changing the values of the gas drag parameter ( @xmath75 )",
    ". figures  [ fig : tncap_578 ] show the evolution of the number of captured planetesimals for @xmath100 ( corresponding to @xmath101 m for the gas - starved disk model ) , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 km ) , and @xmath104 @xmath105 km ) , respectively .",
    "general behavior is similar to the case with @xmath76 ( figure  [ fig : tncap_6 ] ) , but , the timescale to reach the equilibrium state increases with deceasing strength of gas drag because the rates of capture and orbital decay are reduced .",
    "we find that the number of planetesimals captured in prograde orbits in the case of @xmath106 ( @xmath101 km ) is significantly smaller than the other cases , because the capture radius for prograde orbits in this case is smaller than the physical size of the planet . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of planetesimals captured in retrograde orbits in this case is somewhat larger , because the lifetime of planetesimals in retrograde orbits becomes longer under such weak gas drag .",
    "figure [ fig : nave ] shows the number of captured planetesimals in the disk in the equilibrium state as a function of @xmath66 ( or @xmath16 ) .",
    "we find that the number hardly depends on the planetesimal size for the intermediate values of @xmath66 , while it decreases for small and large values of @xmath66 for the reasons described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : rns_578 ] shows the surface number density distribution for various values of @xmath66 .",
    "the general features of the distribution are similar to the case of @xmath76 shown in figure  [ fig : rns_6 ] , which suggests that these features are common for a wide range of gas drag parameters . in the case of @xmath100 , planetesimals can be captured by gas drag even in the outer parts of the disk where the gas density is rather low .",
    "thus , the surface number density of captured planetesimals shifts radially outward . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath107 , planetesimals need to pass through the denser part of the disk in order to be captured , thus , the distribution shifts radially inward . in the case of @xmath106 shown in figure",
    "[ fig : rns_578](c ) , the inner region corresponding to single - encounter capture into prograde orbits disappears because the prograde capture radius is smaller than the planet s physical radius .    in some cases ,",
    "captured planetesimals change their direction of orbital motion from retrograde to prograde due to strong headwind after they become permanently captured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of a planet at jupiter s orbit , the change of the orbital direction takes place before planetesimals spiral into the planet when @xmath108 @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig : rst ] shows the surface number density of planetesimals captured into retrograde orbit as a function of radial distance for the cases with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the number density vanishes in the vicinity of the planet because planetesimals captured in retrograde orbits change the direction of orbital motion .",
    "we confirmed that the surface number density of captured planetesimals on prograde orbits increases due to this effect in the innermost region of the disk when @xmath110 .",
    "so far , we have examined capture of planetesimals that are initially on heliocentric circular orbits with uniform radial distribution in the protoplanetary disk . here , we examine effects of dynamical states of incoming planetesimals , i.e. , eccentricities and inclinations of their initial heliocentric orbits , and non - uniform radial distribution in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "we assume that eccentricities and inclinations follow a rayleigh distribution with given rms values ( we assume @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the eccentricity and inclination scaled by @xmath115 ) , and that orbital phase angles are randomly distributed in [ 0 - 2@xmath116 . as for the radial distribution of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk ,",
    "a sufficiently massive planet opens a gap both in the gas and solid component of the disk , and interactions between solid bodies and the gas near the edge of the gap is important for the supply of solids into the circumplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "exact treatment of such interactions requires global simulation of such a system , which is beyond the scope of the present work . instead ,",

    "we find that the surface number density in the inner region that corresponds to capture by a single encounter ( @xmath121 ) decreases significantly with increasing velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "the bump that we find in the case of initially circular orbits and corresponds to the capture radius is smoothed out in the case with non - zero velocity dispersions , because the capture radius depends on the planetesimals velocity dispersion and those with various eccentricities and inclinations are captured in the cases with non - zero velocity dispersions .",
    "we find that the dependence of the distribution in the outer region ( @xmath122 ) on the velocity dispersion is rather weak .",
    "as we mentioned above , the distribution in this region is determined by a balance between capture into relatively long - lived orbits whose types depend on the velocity dispersion @xcite , and rather rapid orbital decay due to large eccentricities of planet - centered orbits .",

    ", the planetesimal - dominated region becomes extended almost to the outer edge of the circumplanetary disk ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "however , the planetesimal - dominated region shrinks when incoming planetesimals have non - zero velocity dispersions in the protoplanetary disk ( figure  [ fig : r_sigma_ecc ] ) .",
    "the region further shrinks if there is a wide gap in the radial distribution of planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk ( figure  [ fig : com_all6 ] ) . from these results , we conclude that the contribution of captured planetesimals would become comparable to or even larger than that of dust particles as building blocks of regular satellites when the velocity dispersion of planetesimals and the width of their gap in the protoplanetary disk are rather small , while their contribution becomes small in the case of larger velocity dispersions and/or a wide gap .      using the surface density distribution of captured planetesimals that we obtained in the previous sections , we can evaluate the timescale of collision among them and examine whether they grow by accretion before spiraling into the planet .",
    "for this purpose , first , we estimate the relative velocity between captured planetesimals , assuming that it is determined by damping due to gas drag and enhancement due to viscus stirring among the planetesimals .",

    "captured planetesimals migrate inward before they grow by accretion . on the other hand , in the inner region where the surface density rapidly increases ( @xmath186 ; figure  [ fig : com_all6 ] ) , @xmath187 and their mutual collision becomes important .",
    "figure  [ fig : tcol](b ) shows the impact velocity @xmath188 between captured planetesimals as a function of the radial distance in the above case .",
    "although the impact velocity is higher than the escape velocity , it is rather low ( @xmath189 ms@xmath190 ) .",
    "recent impact simulations with the effect of material strength show that bodies can accrete and grow in such low - velocity collisions @xcite .",
    "thus , we can expect collisional growth of captured planetesimals in the inner region of the circumplanetary disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface density of captured planetesimals largely depends on the random velocity of the planetesimals disk . as a result , @xmath182 increases with increasing velocity dispersion , and is comparable to or larger than @xmath183 when @xmath191 , even in the inner part of the disk . in this case ,",
    "captured planetesimals would spiral into the planet before they grow significantly by accretion .    in the case of @xmath76 ( @xmath77 m ; figure  [ fig : tcol](c ) ) , the collision timescale in the inner region of the disk becomes somewhat longer than the case with @xmath100 ( @xmath101 m ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion becomes lower also due to the lower surface density of captured planetesimals ( figure  [ fig : tcol](d ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital decay timescale becomes longer , because of weaker gas drag . as a result , @xmath182 becomes shorter than @xmath183 in the vicinity of the planet in the inner region of the disk , and growth of planetesimals by accretion can be expected there . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : eigap ] , the surface number density of captured planetesimals is significantly enhanced in the regions corresponding to the current radial location of regular satellites of giant planets .",
    "our results suggest that once a significant amount of planetesimals are captured in such regions , they would contribute to the growth of regular satellites of giant planets .",
    "further studies including mutual gravitational interactions between captured planetesimals are desirable to quantitatively examine their effect on the growth of satellites .",
    "in the present work , we examined the distribution of planetesimals captured in circumplanetary disks using orbital integration .",
    "we found that the number of captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk reaches an equilibrium state as a balance between continuous capture from their heliocentric orbits by gas drag and orbital decay into the planet .",
    "typically , the number of planetesimals captured into retrograde orbits is much smaller than that on prograde orbits , because those captured on retrograde orbits experience strong headwind and spiral into the planet rapidly . using our numerical results , we obtained surface number density distribution of permanently captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk in the equilibrium state .",
    "we found that the surface number density of captured planetesimals is significantly enhanced at the current location of regular satellites , and that it depends on the dynamical states of planetesimals , i.e. , their initial velocity dispersion in the protoplanetary disk and the presence of a gap in their radial distribution ; larger velocity dispersions and a wider gap both reduce the efficiency of planetesimal capture , thus decreases their surface number density in the disk .",
    "we also examined the surface density ratio of dust and captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk .",
    "we found that solid material at the current location of regular satellites is dominated by captured planetesimals when the random velocity of planetesimals is rather small and a wide gap is not formed in the protoplanetary disk . in this case ,",
    "captured planetesimals can grow by mutual collision before they spiral into the planet due to gas drag .",
    "therefore , captured planetesimals would significantly contribute to the growth of regular satellites .",
    "further studies including mutual gravitational interactions between captured planetesimals are necessary to quantitatively examine their effect on satellite accretion .",
    "also , their importance on satellite accretion relative to dust particles depends on dust - to - planetesimal ratio in the protoplanetary disk and in the circumplanetary disk .",
    "although , the influence of the material density on the radial distribution of captured bodies is expected to be small , mass of captured planetesimals would be reduced by ablation during the passage through the circumplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we examined the effect of ablation during capture of planetesimals by a waning circumplanetary gas disk .",
    "we found that the effect of ablation in the case of planetesimals captured into planet - centered orbits with large semi - major axes ( @xmath192 ) is insignificant , because the mass loss due to ablation mostly occurs during a short period of time when the bodies pass through the dense part of the circumplanetary disk near their pericenter . on the other hand ,",
    "when their semi - major axes become sufficiently small due to orbital decay by gas drag , the captured planetesimals constantly pass through the dense part of the disk , and their mass loss would be significant .",
    "further studies of the influence of ablation of captured planetesimals on satellite accretion would also be desirable .",
    "we thank takayuki tanigawa and toshihiko kadono for discussion , and the anonymous reviewer for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by jsps grants - in - aid for jsps fellows ( 12j01826 ) and scientific research b ( 22340125 and 15h03716 ) .",
    "part of numerical calculations were performed using computer systems at the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "in the present work , we examine cases with @xmath193 m. the assumption of @xmath15 is reasonable for large planetesimals , but the dependence of @xmath14 on the mach number and the reynolds number would be important for small bodies . in order to check the validity of the above assumption , we examined values of the drag coefficient of planetesimals orbiting in the circumplanetary gas disk based on the gas - starved disk model @xcite , and taking account of its dependence on the mach number and the reynolds number following @xcite . for planetesimals captured into retrograde orbits",
    ", we found that @xmath194 regardless of their sizes , because of their large velocity relative to the gas .",
    "for those captured into prograde orbits , @xmath14 can become as large as @xmath195 in the outer part of the disk with @xmath196 , but the values become smaller and close to unity in the inner part of the disk ; even in the case of @xmath197 m , we found @xmath198 at @xmath199 , which corresponds to the current radial locations of the galilean satellites .",
    "therefore , we think that the above assumption is reasonable for the size range considered in the present work , although a more exact treatment is required for still smaller bodies .",
    "in the case of capture of planetesimals initially on heliocentric circular orbits into planet - centered prograde orbits shown in figure  [ fig : tncap_6 ] , the number of captured planetesimals rapidly increases for @xmath200 , and its growth slows down for @xmath201 .",
    "this can be explained by the difference in the manner of orbital decay after capture .",
    "figures  [ fig : cap_orbit ] show orbital behavior of planetesimals captured from heliocentric circular orbits when @xmath76 , for three cases with slightly different initial conditions .",
    "the red and green lines show the case of rapid orbital decay after permanent capture , while the blue line shows the case of slow decay .",
    "the time evolution of several quantities for these orbits are shown in figure  [ fig : time_aer ] . in the case of long - lived orbits shown by the blue line ( figures  [ fig : cap_orbit ] , [ fig : time_aer](a ) and [ fig : time_aer](b ) ) , first",
    ", semi - major axis of the planet - centered orbit @xmath202 decreases rapidly , then the body experiences a phase of rather slow orbital decay before spiraling into the planet .",
    "this is because the body maintains a rather large pericenter distance after permanently captured , in contrast to the case of the other short - lived orbits ( figure  [ fig : time_aer](c ) ) . figure  [ fig : time_aer](d ) shows the evolution of the stokes number @xmath203 .",
    "the evolution of the stokes number strongly depends on the eccentricity of the planet - centered orbit , @xmath204 .",
    "when @xmath204 is large , the radial region swept by the planetesimal is very wide , and the relative velocity between the planetesimal and the gas significantly changes depending on the distance from the planet .",
    "this causes the large variation of the stokes number in figure  [ fig : time_aer](d ) .",
    "after @xmath204 becomes sufficiently small , the oscillation in the stokes number ceases because the radial distance from the planet becomes nearly constant .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of gas accretion onto a forming giant planet show the formation of circumplanetary disk , whose gas density distribution is nearly axisymmetric in the vicinity of the planet .",
    "although detailed structure of the disk depends on the parameters adopted in simulations , here we consider a simple model on the basis of recent high resolution simulations @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that the size of the circumplanetary disk is given by @xmath205 with @xmath6 being the planet s hill radius , and the gas surface density at this disk edge is approximately 10 times enhanced compared to the unperturbed surface density of the protoplanetary disk , @xmath139 .",
    "we assume that @xmath139 at this last stage of giant planet formation is depleted by a factor @xmath135 compared to the gas surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula model , @xmath134 ; @xmath206 . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical value of the gas surface density at the outer edge of the circumplanetary disk in the gas - starved disks model is about 1 g@xmath71 @xcite , while the gas surface density at jupiter s orbit is on the order of 10@xmath207 g@xmath71 in the minimum mass solar nebula model .",
    "therefore , if @xmath136 , the gas surface density of the protoplanetary disk at jupiter s orbit at the time of satellite accretion is @xmath208 g@xmath71 , which gives the surface density of the circumplanetary disk roughly consistent with the gas - starved disk model .",
