    "the lhc is expected to directly probe possible new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) up to a scale of a few tev . while its data should provide answers to several of the major open questions in the present picture of elementary particle physics",
    ", it is important to start examining how this sensitivity can be further extended at a next generation of colliders .",
    "today we have a number of indications that new physics could be of supersymmetric nature .",
    "if this is the case , the lhc will have a variety of signals to discover these new particles and the linear collider ( lc ) will be required to complement the probe of the susy spectrum with detailed measurements .",
    "however , beyond supersymmetry there is a wide range of other scenarios invoking new phenomena at , and beyond , the tev scale .",
    "they are aimed at explaininig the origin of electro - weak symmetry breaking , if there is no light elementary higgs boson , at stabilising the sm , if susy is not realised in nature , or at embedding the sm in a theory of grand unification .",
    "many of such scenarios predict the existence of new particles that would be manifested as rather spectacular resonances in @xmath0 collisions , if the achievable centre - of - mass energy is sufficient .",
    "a high energy lc represents an ideal laboratory for studying this new physics  @xcite .",
    "it also retains an indirect sensitivity , through a precision study of the virtual corrections to electro - weak observables , when their mass exceeds the available centre - of - mass energy .",
    "this paper summarises the results of a series of studies aimed at quantifying the potential of a high energy , high luminosity @xmath0 lc in extending to high scales the probe for new physics .",
    "while a significant activity has already addressed the issues related to a tev - class collider , we now review the potential of a multi - tev lc , such as clic .",
    "the analysis of the lep and slc data has provided a significant experience in the extraction of electro - weak observables , optimising their statistical sensitivity and controlling their systematic uncertainties . at larger centre - of - mass energies ,",
    "the relevant @xmath1 cross sections are significantly reduced and the experimental conditions at the interaction region need to be taken into account in validating the anticipated accuracies on the cross section @xmath2 , forward - backward asymmetries @xmath3 and left - right asymmetries @xmath4 determination at @xmath5 = 1  tev - 5  tev . since the two - fermion cross section is of the order of only 10  fb , it is imperative to achieve high luminosity by reducing the beam - spot sizes . in this regime",
    "the beam - beam effects are important and the primary @xmath0 collision is accompained by several @xmath6 interactions .",
    "being mostly confined in the forward regions , this @xmath7 background reduces the polar angle acceptance for quark flavour tagging and dilutes the jet charge separation using jet charge techniques .",
    "these experimental conditions require efficient and robust algorithms to ensure sensitivity to flavour - specific @xmath8 production .",
    "the statistical accuracy for the determination of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 has been studied , for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , taking the clic parameters at @xmath5 = 3  tev .",
    "the simdet parametrised detector simulation has been used and the @xmath6 background , corresponding to 10 overlayed bunch crossings , has been added to @xmath11 , @xmath10 events .",
    "@xmath10 final states have been identified using an algorithm based on the sampling of the decay charged multiplicity of the highly boosted @xmath12 hadrons at clic energies  @xcite .",
    "similarly to lep analyses , the forward - backward asymmetry has been extracted from a fit to the flow of the jet charge @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the particle charge , @xmath16 its momentum , @xmath17 the jet thrust axis and the sum is extended to all the particles in a given jet . here the presence of additional particles , from the @xmath18 background , causes a broadening of the @xmath13 distribution and thus a dilution of the quark charge separation .",
    "the track selection and the value of the power parameter @xmath19 needed to be optimised as a function of the number of overlayed bunch crossings .",
    "the results are summarised in terms of the relative statistical accuracies @xmath20 in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "another important issue is the accuracy on the luminosity determination , that needs to be controlled to 0.5% , or better .",
    ".relative statistical accuracies on electro - weak observables , obtained for 1  ab@xmath21 of clic data at @xmath5 = 3  tev , including the effect of @xmath6 background .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     fermion compositeness or exchange of very heavy new particles can be described in all generality by four - fermion contact interactions @xcite .",
    "these parametrise the interactions beyond the sm by means of an effective scale , @xmath22 , @xmath23 the strength of the interaction is set by convention as @xmath24 and models can be considered by choosing either @xmath25 or @xmath26 as detailed in table  ii .",
    "the contact scale @xmath27 can be interpreted as effect of new particles at a mass @xmath28 , @xmath29 .    in order to estimate the sensitivity of electro - weak observables to the contact interaction scale @xmath27",
    ", the statistical accuracies discussed in section  ii have been assumed for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 final states .",
    "the systematics of the assumed 0.5% include the contributions from model prediction uncertainties .",
    "results are given in terms of the lower limits on @xmath27 which can be excluded at 95% c.l .",
    ", in figure [ fig : ci ] .",
    "it has been verified that , for the channels considered in the present analysis , the bounds for the different @xmath22 are consistent .",
    "high luminosity @xmath0 collisions at 3  tev can probe @xmath27 at scales of 200  tev , and beyond . for comparison , the corresponding results expected for a lc operating at 1  tev are also shown .",
    "beam polarisation represents an important tool in these studies .",
    "first , it improves the sensitivity to new interactions , through the introduction of the left - right asymmetries @xmath32 and the polarised forward - backward asymmetries @xmath33 in the electro - weak fits .",
    "if both beams can be polarised to @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , the relevant parameter is the effective polarisation defined as @xmath36 . in addition to the improved sensitivity , the uncertainty on the effective polarization , can be made smaller than the error on the individual beam polarization measurements .",
    "secondly , in the case of a significant deviation from the sm prediction would be observed , @xmath37 and @xmath38 polarization is greatly beneficial to determine the nature of the new interactions .",
    "this has been studied in details for a lc at 0.51.0  tev @xcite and those results also apply , qualitatively , to a multi - tev collider .",
    "extending the sensitivity to new physics beyond the anticipated reach of the lhc , is a prime aim of future colliders . by accurately measuring electro - weak observables , a lc able to achieve @xmath0 collisions at and beyond 1  tev , with high luminosity ,",
    "can indirectly probe scales extending from tens to several hundreds tev .",
