    "it has been argued that heavy nuclei will disassociate for a @xmath5 increase in the sum @xmath6",
    "one can anticipate that before this happens , the deuteron will become unbound .",
    "this is because the deuteron binding energy is less than the average binding energy per nucleon . here , we study this problem quantitatively and provide details about how the deuteron would respond to variations in its potential induced by changes in @xmath6  .",
    "the deuteron is an example of a hadronic molecule .",
    "such a two - hadron composite , bound by the strong interactions and whose mass lies slightly below the associated two - hadron threshold , should be describable with a nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .",
    "we can picture the two hadrons as interacting via a meson exchange potential  @xcite .",
    "hadronic , as opposed to quark , degrees of freedom should be appropriate for these situations . in this paper",

    ", our focus will be on the form of the potential energy function @xmath10 , especially as regards the contributions from multi - pion exchanges . in section  iii ,",
    "we carry out a numerical study of how varying the potential energy affects deuteron binding .",
    "our conclusions and plans for future study are presented in section  iv .",
    "although the deuteron state , and more generally the two - nucleon potential , are long - studied areas of research , they continue to attract theoretical attention .",
    "there has been much recent activity about how the nuclear potential behaves in the chiral limit of zero light quark mass  .",
    "this work has motivated our interest in deuteron binding . by design",
    "our description is simple , _",
    "e.g. _ we omit tensor interactions and thus our ` deuteron ' has no d - wave component  @xcite .",
    "we comment further on this aspect of our work in the conclusion .",
    "spatial potential energy functions for nonrelativistic calculations are obtained from particle exchange diagrams in quantum field theory .",
    "a nonrelativistic reduction of the exchange amplitude is followed by fourier transformation from momentum to position space ( see eqs .  ( [ vq])-([vr ] ) below ) . for example , photon exchange between an electron and a proton leads to a number of separate effects ( collectively the _ breit - fermi _ interaction  @xcite ) starting with the long range coulomb potential .",
    "in addition to generating long range potentials , such exchange amplitudes also generally give rise to short range or even local contributions . in this paper , we restrict our attention to only the long range part .      for convenience , we shall cast the potential energy in a dispersive form  @xcite .",
    "the strongest components of the two - nucleon potential arise from the isoscalar ( @xmath11 ) two - pion and three - pion exchange channels .",
    "a smaller isovector two - pion component must also be included .    for isoscalar ( i=0 ) potentials ,",
    "the two - pion ( scalar ) exchange gives rise to an attractive interaction while the three - pion ( vector ) interaction is repulsive .",

    "[ vr ] the above unsubtracted dispersive forms are taken from refs .  , where behavior at relatively low energies ( @xmath16  gev ) is studied .",
    "the issue of high energy behavior and subtractions is considered in ref .",
    "however , the choice of a subtraction scale at sufficiently high energy is not expected to alter the basic conclusions of refs .  , which are anchored by the constraints of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "for the isoscalar vector channel , it is a good approximation to take @xmath17 , where @xmath18  mev .",
    "this is also appropriate for the isovector two - pion exchange channel , where now @xmath19 , with @xmath20  mev . in these two cases ,",
    "the association between an exchanged vector meson of mass @xmath21 and a spatial yukawa potential @xmath22 is natural and obvious .",
    "the isoscalar two - pion exchange channel is more subtle .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon potential is known to have a strong attractive contribution of intermediate range .",
    "this arises from an exchange potential in the scalar , isoscalar channel , due to the exchange of a pair of pions in the @xmath24 channel .",
    "there is now a description of this which , although not explicitly given in terms of quark interactions , does nonetheless respect the underlying qcd dynamics .",
    "the approach is ( i ) to use chiral perturbation theory to describe the low energy part of the momentum - space potential , and ( ii ) to invoke two - pion rescattering via the omnes function at higher energies in order to include the constraint of unitarity .",
    "the chiral component of @xmath25 turns out , as is generally the case in chiral perturbation theory , to depend on a small number of low energy constants whose numerical values are obtained phenomenologically . to the extent that these constants depend on any meson , it is actually @xmath26 that contributes",
    "the chiral form of @xmath25 grows with energy and at some point requires modification in order to respect unitarity .",
    "such a modification can be accomplished  @xcite by introducing the omnes function , & & ^(i=0 ) ( ) =  , [ omnes ] where @xmath27 is the s - wave two - pion phase shift in the @xmath11 channel .   in this manner ,",
    "the two ingredients of chiral perturbation theory and two - pion rescattering provide a sound theoretical basis for understanding the two - pion @xmath28 exchange potential .    in the intermediate energy range @xmath29  mev , the @xmath28 two - pion phase shift does not pass through @xmath30 and thus ( unlike @xmath2 and @xmath26 ) has no obvious association with a resonant state . the dispersive spatial potential of eq .",
    "( [ vr ] ) would seem to require a broad spectral function in this case .",

    "we stress that our use of ` @xmath1 ' is simply a convenient shorthand and not meant to commit us to any specific model of this state  @xcite .",

    "we use this approach because a precise fit will allow us to study the effect on @xmath38 of modifying the potential energy function .",

    "it is mainly the interplay of the large @xmath2 repulsion and @xmath1 attraction that results in the deuteron binding .",
    "although the coefficient of the @xmath2 potential is larger than that of the attractive @xmath1 , the lighter mass of the @xmath1 allows it to dominate over @xmath2 at intermediate distance scales .",

    "the @xmath54 channel has a virtual bound state , as evidenced by the large scattering length @xmath55  fm .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 are isoscalars , a potential energy with only these exchanges would imply equal binding in both the @xmath56 and @xmath54 channels .",
    "however , the @xmath3 contribution is attractive in the deuteron channel but repulsive ( at one third the strength ) in the @xmath54 channel .",

    "for example , it is estimated that taking @xmath60 produces a @xmath61 increase in @xmath49 while increasing @xmath62 to twice its physical value decreases @xmath49 by @xmath63 .",
    "the source of this sensitivity to @xmath64 ( and ultimately to @xmath6 ) lies mainly in the threshold contribution in the dispersive integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ vq]),([vr ] ) .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath65nn and @xmath66nn couplings are relatively unaffected by such changes in the light quark masses because their spectral functions are large only well above threshold .    1",
    ".   _ unbinding of the deuteron via weakening of @xmath45 _ : in our description , the two - nucleon potential is mainly the competition between the attractive @xmath67 and the repulsive @xmath68 .",
    "it is not hard to upset this balance and thus unbind the deuteron by varying some combination of the potential energies , _",
    "e.g. _ by reducing @xmath45 ( keeping all other interactions fixed ) , increasing @xmath69 ( again keeping all other interactions fixed ) , _",
    "etc_. however , the former is the only variation associated with the mass values of the light quarks . to help keep track of how the deuteron binding energy responds to the variation in @xmath70 , we find it useful to define the following ratios , [ ratio ] r^(coup)[g_nn ] r^(be)[be_deut ]  . from the numerical values in table  [ tab : rstab ] , we see that the deuteron becomes unbound if @xmath45 is reduced in strength by about @xmath4 .",
    "this is to be compared with the @xmath71 required to disassociate heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "2 .   _ alternative variations _ : there can , in principle , be other parameter variations . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we briefly consider a few of these .",
    "it is obvious that increasing @xmath45 will increase the deuteron binding energy .",
    "however , there is another consequence , which turns out to somewhat alter the physical world .",
    "we find that an increase of about @xmath72 in @xmath45 , with other potentials held fixed , suffices to first produce binding the @xmath54 nn channel .",
    "varying the @xmath66 and @xmath65 potentials would likewise have physical consequences , _",
    "e.g. _ with @xmath45 fixed , an increase in strength of @xmath69 by about @xmath73 would result in unbinding the deuteron , this kind of variation is not associated in any obvious way with the fundamental parameters of the standard model and thus has no connections with our anthropic analysis .",
    "our aim in this paper has been to explore the dependence of deuteron binding on variations in @xmath6 in terms of a simple model involving just central potentials .",
    "the central potentials were constructed with care , by exploiting up - to - date results from studies of nuclear binding .",
    "this description is admittedly in contrast with the traditional approach which uses the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) tensor potential  @xcite .",
    "we feel that these two procedures are not incompatible .",
    "consider a description containing the huge @xmath74 and @xmath66 potentials along with the tensor ope .",
    "if the @xmath74 and @xmath66 effects cancel even more than in our calculation ( which would involve a slight change in @xmath67 ) , the deuteron binding would be given largely in terms of the tensor ope .",
    "even so , deuteron binding would still feel the changes induced by @xmath6 largely via the effect on @xmath67 ( as described in this paper ) .",
    "we leave for future study a more ambitious description which includes all these elements in a schrdinger equation context , plus insights from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "thus , given the deuteron potential energies of eq .",
    "( [ deutpotl ] ) , we have shown ( _ cf _ table  [ tab : rstab ] ) that a slight reduction in @xmath67 results in unbinding the deuteron .",
    "even a slight weakening of the attractive component results in a large effect . as a result",
    ", the deuteron is a sensitive system for studying how physics would respond to changes in @xmath6 .",
    "the crucial links in the chain of logic which connects these are ( i ) the chiral relation , @xmath75 , which relates the pion mass to the light quark masses and ( ii ) the dispersive formula eq .",
    "( [ vq ] ) which relates @xmath67 to the pion mass  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 decrease in @xmath67 needed to unbind deuterons is less than the estimated @xmath71 needed to unbind heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is abundantly clear that if conditions forbade atoms or nuclei from existing , then there would be no universe as we know it .",
    "the absence of the deuteron , although itself just a solitary quantum particle , would likewise be dramatic .",
    "the deuteron first appears in cosmology as part of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) in the early universe , [ bbn0 ] p + n   d +  . before deuteron formation ,",
    "free neutrons are copious ( about one neutron per five protons ) , but after formation free neutrons are absent ( the number of free neutrons equals the number of deuterons at about 200 seconds after the big bang ) .",
    "once deuterons are formed , they take part in a number of additional bbn reactions , such as fusion with protons and neutrons , [ bbn1 ] d + p  ^3he + d + n  ^3h +  , or with each other , [ bbn2 ] d + d  ^3h + p d + d  ^3he + n  .",
    "these lead to the production of @xmath76 , [ bbn3 ]        although trace amounts of heavier nuclei are formed , the above relations display the basic yield of bbn once the deuteron is formed .",
    "it is clear that , although just a solitary particle , the deuteron occupies a central role in bbn .",
    "there are some additional issues , not yet mentioned , which we leave for further study . as regards bbn , it would be interesting to study more carefully what happens under conditions where the deuteron becomes slightly unbound . in a different direction , by using a modification of the meson exchange approach described in this paper , we can consider the possibility of molecular structures in the meson sector",
    ". of particular interest are the states @xmath77 and @xmath78 , whose nearness to the @xmath79 threshold has suggested a molecular interpretation  @xcite .",
