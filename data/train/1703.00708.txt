    "magnetic relaxation is the process by which a magnetic field in a highly conducting fluid seeks a minimum energy state subject to pertinent topological constraints ( moffatt 1985 ) . in the perfect conductivity limit ,",
    "the lines of force ( ` @xmath10-lines ' ) are frozen in the fluid , a topological constraint represented by the family of magnetic helicity invariants @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is any lagrangian volume on whose surface @xmath16 ( with unit normal @xmath17 ) @xmath18 . these invariants represent the conserved degree of linkage of @xmath10-lines within @xmath15",
    ". of particular importance is the global magnetic helicity @xmath19 , integrated over the whole domain @xmath20 of fluid .",
    "the magnetic energy @xmath21 then has a lower bound ( arnold 1974 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant that depends on the scale and geometry of @xmath20 .",
    "the particular problem addressed in this paper concerns relaxation in a plasma of extremely low - density @xmath24 , in which the fluid pressure @xmath25 is negligible compared with the magnetic pressure @xmath26 , i.e.  @xmath27 .",
    "flow of the plasma is then driven solely by the lorentz force @xmath28 .",
    "the low density implies further that inertia is negligible compared with the viscous force in the navier - stokes equation , the viscosity @xmath29 being essentially independent of @xmath24 in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "these approximations have been adopted in a cartesian model by bajer & moffatt ( 2013 ) who treated relaxation of a single - component field , and by moffatt ( 2015 ) who considered the case of a two - component field with non - zero helicity . here",
    "we shall consider the situation in a cylindrical geometry , for which the lorentz force includes the ` hoop stress ' associated with curvature of the @xmath10-lines .",
    "we consider a two - component helical field in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath32 of the form @xmath33 the associated current distribution is given by in the definition of @xmath34 . ]",
    "@xmath35 the first objective is to determine how the relaxation of this field is constrained by the initial magnetic helicity distribution .",
    "the component @xmath36 of the field is responsible for the classic ` pinch effect ' ( bennet 1934 ) . in this scenario , it is natural to suppose that the initial @xmath37-component of field is uniform , and that the initial @xmath38-component is concentrated near the outer cylindrical boundary , such a field then providing a radial lorentz force that tends to drive the plasma inwards .",
    "we shall suppose that the resulting radial motion @xmath39 is controlled by viscosity , which , as indicated above , dominates over inertia when the plasma density is sufficiently small .",
    "we further suppose that the fluid pressure is negligible compared with the magnetic pressure , i.e.  this is a ` low-@xmath31 ' plasma .",
    "of course , the fluid pressure increases in the inner region where the density increases ; the effect of this increase can be included without difficulty in the numerical treatment .    in the perfect conductivity limit @xmath40 , the magnetic field evolves according to the ` frozen - field ' equation @xmath41 and , with the neglect of inertia and pressure gradient , the navier - stokes equation degenerates to @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the shear and bulk viscosities . from ( [ induction0 ] ) and ( [ ns0 ] ) ,",
    "an equation may easily be derived for the magnetic energy : @xmath45 \\ , { \\textnormal d}v.\\ ] ] thus @xmath46 is monotonic decreasing and bounded below by ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "equilibrium is attained only when @xmath47 , and then from ( [ ns0 ] ) , @xmath48 , i.e.  the field is ` force - free ' .",
    "hence @xmath49 for some pseudo - scalar function @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 .    for the particular one - dimensional geometry considered in this paper ,",
    "it is therefore to be expected that , when the magnetic diffusivity @xmath1 is sufficiently weak , the field will relax rapidly during an initial stage to a force - free state ( with here @xmath52 ) that has minimum energy compatible with its initial ( conserved ) topology .",
    "minimising energy subject to the _ single _ topological constraint of conserved global helicity yields a force - free field structure with @xmath53cst . ,  a condition that provides reversed axial field near the outer boundary ( taylor 1974 )",
    "however , the dynamical process through which such a reversed field may spontaneously appear is not revealed by the simple process of seeking a minimum - energy state .",
    "such a reversal can not in fact appear for so long as the pinching motion is purely radial .",
    "however , it seems possible that instabilities of the basic relaxing field may lead to an @xmath2-effect , which could conceivably achieve reversal .",
    "we shall explore this possibility in  8 ; first however , we treat simple radial relaxation neglecting any instabilities that may be present .",
    "we suppose that the plasma is contained in the cylindrical annulus @xmath54 , where @xmath55 ; we shall scale all lengths so that , in effect , @xmath56 . the boundaries @xmath57 and @xmath58 are assumed to be thin perfectly conducting cylinders , separating the plasma from the internal and external regions ; these boundaries can therefore support current sheets with both @xmath37- and @xmath38-components .",
    "the electric field is given by @xmath59 , and we suppose that @xmath60 in the internal and external regions , assumed insulating , i.e.  for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",

    "it is now convenient to introduce dimensionless variables @xmath107 and dimensionless parameters @xmath108 we assume that both these parameters are small : @xmath109 ( i.e.  small diffusivity ) ; and @xmath110 ( i.e.  low density ) . with the variables ( [ dimensionless_variables ] ) , and immediately dropping the hats , eqn .",

    "the panels of the figure show ( a ) the inward movement of the density field @xmath121 in response to the negative radial lorentz force ( b ) , which collapses rapidly to near zero ; ( c , d ) the corresponding evolution of the magnetic field components ; ( e ) the rise of both field components at the inner boundary ; ( f ) the decay of magnetic energy ; ( g ) the pseudo - scalar coefficient @xmath122 when the nearly force - free state has been established ; and finally ( h ) the fluxes @xmath123 and @xmath99 which , as expected , remain constant to within numerical error throughout the whole computational period @xmath124 .",
    "the following points are particularly worth noting .",
    "first , there are clearly two phases to the evolution : an initial phase ( here @xmath125 ) during which magnetic diffusion is negligible and the magnetic energy decreases relatively rapidly on the ( dimensional ) time - scale @xmath126 ; and a slow diffusive stage @xmath127 , during which @xmath80 slowly relaxes back to its initial uniform value ( its flux remaining constant ) ; during this phase , @xmath128 also slowly decays to a constant @xmath129 , implying ultimate concentration of axial current as a current sheet on the inner boundary @xmath57 .",
    "second , although not shown in the figure , the energy @xmath130 of the @xmath80-field actually _ increases _ during the initial phase ( reaching a maximum at @xmath131 ) , but this increase is more than compensated by the decrease of energy of the @xmath85-field .",
    "later , during the slow diffusive stage , both contributions to energy slowly decrease .",
    "[ fig_relaxation00](f ) shows the decay of energy for @xmath132 as well as for @xmath133 ; as expected , the diffusive effect is less apparent in the former case , but the initial ( non - diffusive ) stage is quite similar .",

    "[ fig_relaxation00](g ) , is far from uniform in @xmath136 , so this is certainly not a taylor state ( for which @xmath12 would necessarily be uniform ) .",
    "the weak time - dependence of @xmath12 results from slow continuing evolution during the diffusive stage .",
    "this stage is interesting because the field components continuously adjust themselves in such a way that the force - free condition is maintained ; in other words , this is not a pure diffusive process , but one that is still constrained to remain nearly force - free through the dynamics encapsulated in eqn .",

    "it is obvious that purely radial flow can not lead to local reversal of an axial field that is initially uniform , even in conjunction with diffusion .",
    "however , the situation considered by taylor ( 1974 ) in the context of the reversed - field pinch was that of a fully turbulent plasma in which more complex processes must be present .",
