    "change point detection is the problem of detecting an abrupt change or changes arising in a sequence of observed samples . a common problem of this type involves detecting shifts in the mean of a temporal process .",
    "this problem has found a variety of applications in many fields , including audio analysis  @xcite , eeg segmentation  @xcite , structural health monitoring  @xcite and environment sciences  @xcite . despite advances in the development of algorithms  @xcite and asymptotic theory  @xcite for a number of contexts ,",
    "such studies are mainly confined to the setting of ( conditionally ) independently distributed data .",
    "existing works on optimal detection of shifts in the mean in temporal data with statistically dependent observations are far less common .",
    "incorporating dependence structures into the modelling of random processes is a natural approach .",
    "in fact , this has been considered in detecting changes of remotely collected data  @xcite .",
    "for instance , chandola et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a gaussian process based algorithm to identify changes in normalized difference vegetation index ( ndvi ) time series for a particular location in california . despite such statistical modelling considerations , to our knowledge , most researchers have not exploited the dependence structures of the underlying temporal process , e.g. , its covariance function and spectral density , in designing a ( minimax ) optimal detection method .    in this paper , we focus on the detection of a single change in the mean of a gaussian process data sequence .",
    "our main contribution is to show that neglecting the dependence structures in the data samples leads to suboptimal detection procedures , particularly in the presence of strong correlation among samples .",
    "moreover , it is possible to exploit the underlying dependence structures to design asymptotically optimal detection algorithms .",
    "consider a simplified setting in which we let @xmath0 be a gaussian process in a domain @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the finite index set of sampling points .",
    "denote the observed samples by @xmath3 in which @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath6 ( the parameter @xmath7 is a positive scalar which will be introduced in section [ dtctprocedure ] ) and @xmath8 represents the point of sudden change and the jump / shift value , respectively .",
    "namely , there is @xmath9 ( which will be assumed to be 0 for now ) such that @xmath10 to analyze the performance of a detection procedure as sample size @xmath11 grows to infinity , one is confronted with two fundamentally different theoretical frameworks : _ increasing domain asymptotics _ and _ fixed domain ( infill ) asymptotics _ ( @xcite , chapter 13 ) . the former arises naturally in time series analysis , which is distinguished by the constraint that the distance between consecutive sampling _ time _",
    "points are bounded away from zero .",
    "the simplest instance of the sampling scenario in this regime arises when the diameter of @xmath12 is of order @xmath11 and @xmath13 for some strictly positive , fixed scalar @xmath14 . in our notation",
    "the index set for the gaussian process represents the sampling time points .",
    "typically we set @xmath15 and @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "see , @xcite for examples of works studying change point detection via increasing domain asymptotics .",
    "fixed domain asymptotics , one the other hand , is a more suitable setting when the index set of sampling points @xmath18 is bounded , so that the observations get denser in @xmath18 as @xmath11 increases . particularly for @xmath19 , we have that @xmath20 for positive integers @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and it can be extended to multidimensional domains in a straightforward way .",
    "this is the case for spatially distributed data @xcite , where the domain of the index set is typically of one , two or three dimensions .",
    "but there are also other examples : a particularly useful approach to change point detection in non - stationary processes widely adopted in speech processing and finance can also be cast in this framework .",
    "in fact , this approach involves _",
    "piecewise locally stationary ( pls ) processes _ , which can be interpreted as processes that are approximately piecewise stationary , due to the gradual and smooth change of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "abrupt change detection in pls processes has been considered in , for instance , @xcite .",
    "since the future samples of a pls process may not carry any information about the current state of the process , the increasing domain setting can not suitably capture the dependence structure of the observed data sequence . as a result ,",
    "the theory of change detection and inference in pls processes is also based upon fixed domain asymptotics .",
    "our goal in this work is to derive a computationally efficient detection procedure that effectively accounts for the underlying dependence structures of the observed sequential data . for the analysis of such a procedure we shall adopt both aforementioned asymptotic frameworks .",
    "obviously , specific applications ultimately determine which one among the two is more suitable .",
    "there are also several motivations for this dual treatment .",
    "first , we are not aware of any established detection algorithm and accompanying asymptotic theory under the fixed - domain setting .",
    "second , although there is a vast literature on the change point detection in the increasing domain scenario , existing work focus mostly on independent ( or conditionally independent ) data sequences , so our analysis in this setting still carries some notable novelty .",
    "third , there is a fundamental difference in the behavior of the same detection algorithm when applied to the two asymptotic settings .",
    "this point is worth highlighting : we will show that in the fixed domain setting , ignoring the underlying dependence structure may result in suboptimal detection performance , but this is not the case for the increasing domain setting .",
    "finally , we note that the fixed domain minimax detection problem considered in this paper also serves as a useful starting point in the study of optimal detection of discontinuities in gaussian spatial processes , as considered recently by @xcite .",
    "the amount of correlation between the nearby samples is one of the differences among the two asymptotic frameworks that will plays a crucial role in our results . in the fixed domain regime , regardless of how large the sample size is , if @xmath23 is of order @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , the correlation among @xmath26 and @xmath27 is still so close to one . roughly speaking ,",
    "the effective sample size is much smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "however , in the increasing domain setting , even for long range dependent processes the correlation among samples at time points @xmath28 is small when @xmath23 is large .",
    "accordingly , the asymptotic behavior of a statistical method applied to the fixed - domain regime is expected to be distinct from that of the increasing domain regime . moreover ,",
    "new techniques are needed to address the statistical dependence intrinsic in the former .    from here on , for fixed domain asymptotic results , we assume that @xmath0 is a one dimensional gaussian process in @xmath29}$ ] with @xmath11 regularly spaced samples , i.e. @xmath30 . under the increasing domain asymptotics framework , we let @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the remaining notations are the same for both .",
    "[ [ previous - works . ] ] previous works .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the earliest attempts to study shift in mean detection was perhaps that of chernoff et al .",
    "more general settings of this problem have been studied in subsequent works , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for instance it is assumed in @xcite that the sequence of @xmath33 s are independent gaussian variables .",
    "they proposed a detection method based on generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) , also known as the _ cumulative sum ( cusum ) _ test , and given by @xmath34 cusum compares the maximum of a test statistic over @xmath35 with a critical values @xmath36 .",
    "non - asymptotic upper bounds on the error probabilities of this simple test were obtained by the authors under the gaussian and i.i.d",
    ". assumptions .",
    "interestingly , due to test s simplicity , when such assumptions do not hold , one can still apply the same test statistic to the data sequence .",
    "most subsequent works appeared to follow this direction , in addition to adhering to the increasing domain asymptotic framework , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we wish to mention rencova ( @xcite , chapter 4 ) , who studied the same cusum test as @xcite , but working with the assumption that @xmath37 be a strong mixing time series .",
    "kokoszka  @xcite also analyzed the cusum test , but working with a different dependent observation model with sub - squared growth of the variance of partial sum , i.e. there is @xmath38 such that for any @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "horvth et al .",
    "@xcite and antoch @xcite studied the performance of the cusum test for the detection of a sudden change in the mean in linear processes , i.e. @xmath41 , in which @xmath42 are i.i.d .",
    "and zero mean random variables and the weights @xmath43 satisfy some properties such as absolute or square summability .    at first sight",
    ", it may seem puzzling how the cusum test continues to admit nearly optimal detection performance even as its test statistics apparently ignore the dependence among data samples .",
    "a high - level explanation can be made regarding this phenomenon : when @xmath0 is a gaussian process with @xmath44 and the covariance function @xmath45 as @xmath46 grows to infinity , the percentage of pairs @xmath47 whose covariance is non - negligible tends to zero as @xmath48 . as a result , there is very little gain in accounting for the dependence structures underlying the sequence , and so the cusum statistic provides a good approximation of the likelihood ratio test for large @xmath11 , leading to the asymptotic optimality of @xmath49 in the increasing domain setting .",
    "this is of course not the case for the fixed domain setting . indeed ,",
    "one of the contributions of this paper is to show that the cusum test is suboptimal when applied to the fixed domain setting of the detection problem .",
    "moreover , to achieve mimimax optimal detection performance we shall develop a new test statistic that account for the underlying dependence structures in the data sequence .",
    "we also note in passing that in comparison to the increasing domain analysis typically encountered in the literature , the theoretical analysis for the fixed domain setting is considerably more challenging , as one needs to take into account the statistical dependence in the data sequence in a more fundamental way .",
    "cusum test also applied to one dimensional processes with highly correlated samples , after a proper standardization .",
    "for instance , horvth et al .",
    "@xcite used a different normalizing factor for applying cusum to one dimensional gaussian time series with long range dependence .",
    "however apart from standardizing factor , they do not directly incorporate the correlation structures of the data in the formulation of the test statistic . note that , the proposed test in this paper achieve consistency under weaker condition on minimal detectable jump .",
    "furthermore , lai @xcite adjusts cusum test for detecting abrupt changes in the mean of a stochastic process .",
    "however we are not aware of the analysis of change point problem , for the case of unknown before and after distribution parameters , in the infill regimes and its comparison with the increasing domain setup .",
    "there are also some notable works ( see e.g. , @xcite ) on estimating the volatility parameter of non - stationary time series using the change point models .",

    "we show when it is important to account for the dependence structure in the data sequence , and analyze a number of detection algorithms based upon a generalized likelihood ratio test .",
    "more specifically , our contributions are as follows",
    ".    1 .   given an @xmath11-sample drawn from a one dimensional gaussian process data with a known covariance structure , we propose a generalized likelihood ratio test for detecting a sudden shift in the mean .",
    "this method requires the knowledge of the dependence structure ( via the covariance matrix ) , and will be shown to achieve asymptotically optimal detection performance in both fixed and increasing domain settings .",
    "our theory holds for a variety of covariance structures , such as the matern class , powered exponential class , and several others specified in terms of the covariance kernel s spectral density .",
    "the smoothness parameter for the gaussian process ( which determines how fast the corresponding spectral density decays ) plays a central role in characterizing the minimax optimal detection performance  but this is shown to be the case only in the fixed domain setting , _ not _ in the increasing domain setting . 2 .",
    "we provide an upper bound guarantee for the cusum detection method .",
    "this result confirms that the cusum is asymptotically optimal in the increasing domain setting , but it also suggests that the cusum is suboptimal in the fixed domain setting .",
    "the suboptimality is confirmed in our simulation study , which demonstrates a wide gap between the cusum and our method .",
    "this result makes sense , in light of the minimax result described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "3 .   in practice ,",
    "the covariance structure is not known a priori , and often has to be estimated from the data . to address this scenario ,",
    "we propose a plug - in glrt method , and analyze its performance . in particular , we derive detection performance bounds which also account for the quality of a particular covariance estimation method ( such as mle based methods with dense or tapered covariances ) used in the plug - in glrt .",
    "most surprisingly , we show that as long as a consistent covariance estimate is employed ( the notion of consistency will be defined in section [ dtctrateunknwnspden ] ) , regardless of its estimation rate , the plug - in glrt achieves asymptotically optimal detection performance .",
    "moreover , in some situations a plug - in glrt with an inconsistent covariance estimate is shown to perform almost as well as the case of known covariance .",
    "in addition to the above contributions , our proof methods contain several useful techniques .",

    "<S> we study the problem of detecting a change in the mean of one - dimensional gaussian process data . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is investigated in the setting of increasing domain ( customarily employed in time series analysis ) and in the setting of fixed domain ( typically arising in spatial data analysis ) . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a detection method based on the generalized likelihood ratio test ( glrt ) , and show that our method achieves nearly asymptotically optimal rate in the minimax sense , in both settings . </S>",
    "<S> the salient feature of the proposed method is that it exploits in an efficient way the data dependence captured by the gaussian process covariance structure . </S>",
    "<S> when the covariance is not known , we propose the plug - in glrt method and derive conditions under which the method remains asymptotically near optimal . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the standard cusum method , which does not account for the covariance structure , is shown to be asymptotically optimal only in the increasing domain . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithms and accompanying theory are applicable to a wide variety of covariance structures , including the matern class , the powered exponential class , and others . </S>",
    "<S> the plug - in glrt method is shown to perform well for maximum likelihood estimators with a dense covariance matrix . </S>"
