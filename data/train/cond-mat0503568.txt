    "during the last two decades significant progress has been made regarding novel microscopy techniques , that are mainly based on the observation of single or few molecules . with the aid of single particle tracking , photonic force microscopy , or fluorescence - based single - molecule microscopy",

    "diffusion coefficients extracted from experimental data usually correspond to projected diffusion in a flat plane .",
    "the fluctuations of the membrane , however , lead to a three - dimensional motion of the diffusing protein , but unlike free three - dimensional diffusion the particle is confined to the membrane . since the fluctuation spectrum of the membrane can be affected by external parameters , like e.g.  temperature , osmotic pressure or ph differences  @xcite , these high accuracy methods should make the apparent change in diffusion experimentally measurable .    in this paper , we are interested in how big the difference between the actual intramembrane and the measured projected diffusion constant is .",

    "surprisingly the weakest influence on the diffusion constant is found for small rigidity @xmath44 and small effective tension @xmath45 , i.e.  for membranes with strong fluctuations .",
    "this follows from a partial compensation of the two effects discussed in this paper : while the curvature - coupled interaction between membrane and protein enhances diffusion , the fluctuations reduce the projected diffusion in the @xmath18-@xmath19-plane , cf .",

    "this becomes especially visible , in the case of constant @xmath44 and increasing @xmath45 : initially , an increase in the diffusion constant is observed followed by a subsequent decrease .",
    "in summary , we have found that thermal fluctuations of biomembranes have considerable influence on the diffusion of proteins .",
    "when the protein is free to diffuse within the membrane , the projected diffusion constant , which corresponds to the quantity typically measured , is up to 15% smaller than that of the true intramembrane diffusion . the lower the bending rigidity or the effective tension and the larger the membrane , the stronger is this effect .",
    "experimentally , it could be studied by observing the change in the projected diffusion constant upon osmotically induced swelling of an initially flaccid vesicle , which increases the effective tension  @xcite . to gain insight into the influence of protein - membrane interactions",
    ", we studied the diffusion of an inclusion with a spontaneous curvature and found that this enhances diffusion significantly .",
    "when the projected diffusion constant is measured this leads to an interesting interplay : on the one hand fluctuations can lead to enhanced intramembrane diffusion , while on the other hand stronger fluctuations lead to a smaller projected diffusion constant .",
    "it is therefore possible that the measurement of the diffusion coefficient at constant rigidity and increasing effective tension reveals a maximum for a certain effective tension .",
    "future experimental studies should analyse the effect of changing membrane fluctuations on the lateral diffusion of proteins , since they could shed light on the local coupling mechanisms between proteins and lipids ."
