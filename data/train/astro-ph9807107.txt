    "the origin and nature of the diffuse x - ray background ( dxb ) in the 0.5  2.0 kev band has been a puzzle for the last three decades . in the galactic plane , study of the 0.5  2.0 kev band dxb",
    "is complicated by the presence of discrete galactic emission features ( e.g. , supernova remnants ) which must be accounted for in any investigation of the diffuse component . despite the difficulties",
    "it can be safely assumed that the 0.5  2.0 kev dxb in the plane is galactic in origin since extragalactic emission is completely absorbed and contributions due to unresolved stellar sources have been shown to be small ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . provided that the contribution from galactic discrete emission features can be effectively removed , the galactic plane is , then , a useful laboratory for the study of the galactic component of the dxb .",
    "one way to study the 3-dimensional spatial structure of this galactic component is to search for `` shadows '' cast by absorbing molecular gas at various distances and directions .",
    "the  xrt / pspc is an ideal tool for this type of study with its large field of view ( 2@xmath6 diameter ) , good angular resolution ( 25@xmath7 on - axis ) , and soft x - ray bandpass ( 0.1  2.4 kev ) .",
    "previous studies at high galactic latitudes utilizing the  pspc ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have demonstrated the utility of the `` shadowing '' technique , which is enhanced when the absorbing cloud is at a known distance .",
    "recently , x - ray shadows in the dxb cast by distant molecular gas in the galactic plane have been detected in the direction of _ l _",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath6 with a mosaic of  pspc pointed observations ( @xcite , pfsd hereafter ) .",
    "pfsd detected a shadowing depth in both the @xmath4  kev and 1.5 kev bands of @xmath543% and the derived background intensity ( beyond the absorbing molecular gas ) is more than an order of magnitude brighter than the nominal high latitude intensity .",
    "this striking result implies the existence of an x - ray emitting galactic bulge . this observation is consistent with analysis of  all - sky survey data in the general direction of the galactic center ( @xcite ) where excess emission observed at high galactic latitudes",
    "was extrapolated down to the galactic plane .",
    "pfsd determined that the de - absorbed background spectrum of the tentative galactic x - ray bulge is consistent with an @xmath510@xmath8 k thermal plasma , also in good agreement with the all - sky survey results . here",
    "we report the detection of x - ray shadows cast by distant molecular clouds in the direction of _ l _",
    "@xmath5 25@xmath6 in the galactic plane .",
    "there is probably a much more complicated mixture of x - ray emission and absorption along the line of sight toward _",
    "@xmath5 25@xmath6 than toward the _",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath6 region studied by pfsd . toward _",
    "@xmath5 10@xmath6 , the line of sight passes through the molecular ring and then through a long section of the galactic center region where the density of both atomic and molecular gas is very low and the x - ray emission , presumably , originates ( the x - ray bulge ) .",
    "most of the neutral and molecular gas therefore lies in front of most of the x - ray emission , and clouds are seen clearly in silhouette . toward _",
    "@xmath5 25@xmath6 , molecular clouds are more widely distributed along the line of sight , which passes nearly tangent to the inner edge of the molecular ring and through a shorter chord of the x - ray bulge .",
    "the data used for this study are described in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the analysis and results are presented in ",
    "[ sec : results ] and the implications are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "previous studies of the dxb using x - ray shadows cast by nearby molecular clouds have utilized the anticorrelation between the x - ray intensity and the  100 @xmath9 m intensity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the  100 @xmath9 m data are a reasonable gas tracer and the utility of these data has been demonstrated with high - latitude molecular clouds with _ known",
    "_ distances ( e.g. , draco cloud at @xmath5300 pc , @xcite , @xcite ; mbm12 at @xmath565 pc , @xcite ) or nearby low - latitude dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , coalsack at @xmath5200 pc from the sun , @xcite ) .",
    "however , to search for 0.5  2.0 kev band x - ray shadows cast by `` distant '' ( @xmath101 kpc ) molecular clouds in the galactic plane , the  100 @xmath9 m data are of limited use , since there are generally many clouds overlapped along the line of sight and with no velocity information there is no way to determine their individual distances .",
    "the  100 @xmath9 m data can also be confused by emission from hii  regions in the plane .",
    "these difficulties with the  100 @xmath9 m data can be overcome by studying the x - ray anticorrelations with co spectral line data , a standard tracer of interstellar molecular gas . although co data also have their own complications such as the conversion between co intensity and h column density , they clearly provide better information regarding absorbing molecular clouds in the plane .",
    "this work is thus based upon information derived from such data .",
    "the soft x - ray data utilized in this study consist of 5  ( @xcite ) pspc pointed observations ( see table  [ tbl : observations ] ) .",
    "data from all 5 pointings were obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc )  public archive .",
    "the r4 , r5 , r6 , and r7 band data ( cf .",
    ", @xcite for band definitions ) are utilized in the study of the 0.5  2.0 kev band dxb in the galactic plane .",
    "the r1l and r2 band emission , comprising a @xmath11  kev band , is assumed to have a completely different origin ; i.e. , the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , a region of @xmath510@xmath12 k plasma surrounding the sun with an average extent of @xmath5100 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "this emission is thus not considered in this study .    since non - cosmic contamination must be carefully handled when studying the dxb , all identified non - cosmic contributions to the counting rate",
    "must be excluded by time selection or modeled and subtracted from the data .",
    "we modeled and subtracted the particle background , scattered solar x - ray background , and long - term enhancements from the data .",
    "a detailed description of the non - cosmic background subtraction methods can be found in the literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also eliminated contamination due to short - term enhancements including auroral x - rays , solar flares , and enhanced charged - particle rates encountered near the south atlantic anomaly and particle belts by excluding all observation time intervals which display anomalous peaks in their light curves .",
    "for these 5 pointings , the mean contribution of the modeled non - cosmic contamination to the counts is @xmath513% in the 0.5  2.0 kev band .",
    "we removed the detected point sources and extended discrete emission features ( e.g. , snrs ) from the data prior to the dxb analysis .",
    "unresolved point sources are expected to provide only a minor contribution to the surface brightness .    after all identified non - cosmic contamination , detected point sources , and discrete extended emission features are removed ,",
    "the individual pspc pointings are merged into large - area mosaics in two bands : the @xmath4  kev band ( r4+r5 ) and the 1.5 kev band ( r6+r7 ) .",
    "the determination of the relative offsets in the zero level between the individual observations is performed by comparing the average count rates in the overlapping regions between all pairs of observations .",
    "the contribution from this correction is typically small ( @xmath52% and @xmath53% of the total counts in the @xmath4  kev band and the 1.5 kev band , respectively ) for the entire field of view .",
    "the software for this task ( @xcite ) was provided by the us  science data center ( usrsdc ) at nasa / gsfc .",
    "the final  pspc mosaics of the @xmath13 direction of the galactic plane are displayed in figure  [ fig : xr]a ( the @xmath4  kev band ) and figure  [ fig : xr]b ( the 1.5 kev band ) . for the purpose of display , the data were smoothed to 7.5@xmath14 resolution in order to match the resolution of the co data used .",
    "the circles in figure  [ fig : xr]a indicate the 10 regions where detected bright point sources and discrete extended emission features have been removed .",
    "combined as a mosaic , the average exposure for this field is @xmath15  ks yielding @xmath16% ( 1.5 kev band ) and @xmath17% ( @xmath4  kev band ) statistical errors for individual 5@xmath14 pixels .",
    "the co data used in the present study were obtained with the cfa 1.2 m telescope as part of a large on - going survey of the first galactic quadrant ( @xcite ) . at 115 ghz ,",
    "the frequency of the j = 1  0 rotational transition , the telescope has a beamwidth of 8.4@xmath14 ( fwhm ) and its 256-channel spectrometer provides a velocity resolution of 0.65 km s@xmath18 and total bandwidth of 166 km s@xmath18 .",
    "observations were spaced roughly every beamwidth ( 7.5@xmath14 ) on a galactic grid , and the rms sensitivity of 0.14 k ( t@xmath19 ) was more than adequate for the present purpose .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrco ] compares the 1.5 kev band x - ray image with contours of co intensity integrated over 3 different ranges of velocity . for the clarity of the presentation of the co intensity variation ,",
    "gray - scale co images for the same 3 velocity intervals are displayed in figure  [ fig : co ] .",
    "the overall anticorrelation between the x - ray and the co intensities , as presented in figure  [ fig : xrco ] , reveals several x - ray shadows .",

    "@xmath5 23.5@xmath6,0@xmath6 appears to arise mainly from a molecular cloud at a velocity of @xmath5 54 km s@xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : xrco]b ) for which the near kinematic distance is @xmath53.8 kpc . despite the clear shadowing feature in this region , a detailed analysis of shadow a is unwarranted due to the difficulty in extracting a meaningful off - cloud surface brightness ( see below for more discussion ) .",

    "this intense co feature is believed to be a large star - forming cloud at the far kinematic distance ( d @xmath5 13 kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the bulk of the detected diffuse x - ray emission is originating from within or foreground to the galactic x - ray bulge , no detected shadow by this co enhancement is reasonable since this cloud should be located behind the 0.5  2.0 kev band x - ray emitting region .",

    "@xmath5 24.6@xmath6,0@xmath6 seems to be associated with the molecular clouds in the velocity interval v = 30  55 km s@xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : xrco]b ) which corresponds to a near kinematic distance of @xmath53 kpc .",
    "the molecular clouds in the velocity interval 55  130 km s@xmath18 , however , seem to contribute substantially to this shadow as well ( figure  [ fig : xrco]c ) .",
    "this complexity may arise from the existence of numerous molecular clouds along this line of sight due to the galactic structure in this direction . as a matter of fact , the velocity - integrated co intensity in the region of shadow b ( _ l , b _",

    "the origin of shadow c is unclear .",
    "the co intensity in this region is relatively strong in the velocity range of 30  130 km s@xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : xrco]b and figure  [ fig : xrco]c ) , but figure  [ fig : xrco]a suggests that lower - velocity gas may also contribute to the shadow , which would be reasonable as at least some of the gas is likely to be nearby .",
