    "graph embeddings and linear layouts of graphs play an important role in graph drawing , parallel processing , matrix computation , vlsi design , and permutation sorting .",
    "a linear layout prescribes the order in which the vertices are processed and the embedding of the edges reveals structural properties of the given graph .",
    "a particular example is a book embedding in which the edges are assigned to pages such that edges in the same page nest and do not cross .",
    "equivalently , the vertices are visited in the linear order and the edges are processed in stacks .",
    "the concept of a book embedding of a graph was introduced by ollmann  @xcite and by kainen  @xcite and can be formalized as follows .",
    "a @xmath1-page book embedding of a graph @xmath2 is defined by a linear order of the vertices of @xmath0 and a partition of the edges into @xmath1 sets @xmath3 , so that the vertices of @xmath0 are placed on a line in the given order and edges in @xmath4 are drawn on page @xmath5 ( typically with circular arcs ) , so that no two edges on the same page cross .",
    "the book thickness of the graph @xmath0 is the smallest number of pages needed , also known as stack number or page number .",
    "the book thickness of planar graphs has been studied for over 40 years .",
    "bernhart and kainen  @xcite characterized the graphs with book thickness one as the outerplanar graphs and the graphs with book thickness two as the sub - hamiltonian planar graphs . deciding whether a general planar graph has book thickness two is np - hard  @xcite .",
    "it is known that planar graphs require 3 pages and a series of improvements brought down the upper bound from 9  @xcite , to 7  @xcite , and 4  @xcite .",
    "although in an earlier version of his 1989 paper yannakakis in 1986  @xcite claimed 4 pages are necessary , and later dujmovic and wood in 2007  @xcite also conjectured the same lower bound , there is still no conclusive evidence that this is indeed the case .",
    "more recently there has been a greater interest in studying non - planar graphs which extend planar graphs by restrictions on crossings .",
    "a particular example are _ 1-planar graphs _ which can be drawn in the plane with at most one crossing per edge .",
    "such graphs were first defined by ringel in the context of simultaneously drawing a planar graph and its dual  @xcite . in many respects ,",
    "1-planar graphs generalize planar graphs .",
    "there are 1-planar embeddings as witnesses of 1-planarity , in which the crossings are treated as special vertices of degree four , and which then result in planarizations .",
    "like @xmath6-vertex planar graphs which have at most @xmath7 edges , @xmath6-vertex 1-planar graphs have at most @xmath8 edges  @xcite .",
    "both planar and 1-planar 3-connected graphs admit straight - line drawings in @xmath9 area ( with the exception of one edge in the outer face for the densest 1-planar graphs )  @xcite",
    ". however , there is a major difference in the complexity of the recognition of planar and 1-planar graphs , which can be done in linear time for planar graphs while it is @xmath10-hard for 1-planar graphs  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is a cubic time recognition algorithm for hole - free map graphs  @xcite , which for 3-connected graphs coincide with _ planar - maximal _ 1-planar graphs ( i.e. , where no edge can be added without creating more crossing ) .    in this paper",
    ", we address the problem of book embedding of 1-planar graphs .",
    "recently bekos _ et al . _",
    "@xcite gave a constant upper bound of 39 on the book thickness of 1-planar graphs .",
    "here we prove that 1-planar graphs have book thickness at most 16 and 3-connected 1-planar graphs have book thickness at most 12 . if the planar skeleton is hamiltonian , then four pages suffice , and we have found 1-planar graphs which need four pages .",
    "a _ drawing _ of a graph @xmath0 is a mapping of @xmath0 into the plane such that vertices are mapped to distinct points and edges are jordan arcs between their endpoints .",
    "a drawing is _ planar _ if the edges do not cross and it is _ 1-planar _ if each edge is crossed at most once . hence in a 1-planar drawing the crossing edges come in pairs .",
    "for example , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are 1-planar graphs",
    ". an _ embedding _ of a graph is planar ( resp .",
    "1-planar ) if it admits a planar ( resp .",
    "1-planar ) drawing .",
    "an embedding specifies the _ faces _ , which are topologically connected regions .",
    "the unbounded face is the _",
    "outer face_. accordingly , a 1-_planar embedding _",
    "@xmath13 specifies the faces in a 1-planar drawing of @xmath0 including the outer face . a 1-planar embedding is a witness for 1-planarity . in particular",
    ", @xmath13 describes the pairs of crossing edges , the faces where the edges cross , and the _ planar _ edges .",
    "augment a given 1-planar embedding @xmath13 by adding as many edges to @xmath13 as possible so that @xmath0 remains a simple graph and the newly added edges are planar in @xmath13 .",
    "we call such an embedding a _ planar - maximal _ embedding of @xmath0 and the operation _ planar - maximal augmentation_. then each pair of crossing edges is augmented to a @xmath14 .",
    "the _ planar skeleton _ @xmath15 consists of the planar edges of a planar - maximal augmentation .",
    "it is a planar embedded graph , since all pairs of crossing edges are omitted .",
    "note that the planar augmentation and the planar skeleton are defined for an embedding , not for a graph .",
    "the _ normal form _ for an embedded 3-connected 1-planar graph @xmath13 is obtained by first adding the four planar edges to form a @xmath14 for each pair of crossing edges while routing them close to the crossing edges and then removing old duplicate edges if necessary .",
    "such an embedding of a 3-connected 1-planar graph is a normal embedding of it .",
    "a _ normal planar - maximal augmentation _ for an embedded 3-connected 1-planar graph is obtained by first finding a normal form of the embedding and then by a planar - maximal augmentation .",
    "given a 1-planar embedding @xmath13 , the normal planar - maximal augmentation of @xmath13 can be computed in linear time  @xcite .",
    "we say that an embedded 3-connected 1-planar graph is a _",
    "normal planar maximal _",
    "1-planar graph if a normal planar maximal augmentation of the graph yields the same graph . in a 3-connected normal planar - maximal 1-planar graph ,",
    "each pair of crossing edges @xmath16 and @xmath17 crosses each other either inside or outside the boundary of the quadrangle @xmath18 of the planar edges , and these define the so - called _ augmented x- _ and _ augmented b - configurations _  @xcite .    for a 3-connected 1-planar graph @xmath0 ,",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proved the following :    @xcite [ lem : embedding ] let @xmath0 be a 3-connected 1-planar graph with a 1-planar embedding @xmath13 .",
    "then the normal planar - maximal augmentation of @xmath13 gives a planar - maximal 1-planar embedding @xmath19 of a supergraph @xmath20 of @xmath0 so that @xmath19 contains at most one augmented b - configuration in the outer face and each augmented x - configuration in @xmath19 contains no vertex inside its skeleton .",
    "if a graph can be embedded in a given number of pages , the same is true for its subgraphs . given an embedded 3-connected 1-planar graph @xmath0 , we therefore assume that @xmath0 is a normal planar maximal 1-planar graph . lemma  [ lem : embedding ] implies that the planar skeleton of a normal planar maximal 3-connected 1-planar graph @xmath0 contains only triangular and quadrangular faces .",
    "furthermore if we remove exactly one crossing edge ( arbitrarily ) from each pair of crossing edges in @xmath0 , then the resulting graph is a maximal planar graph .",
    "our algorithm uses the a `` peeling technique '' similar to yannakakis  @xcite and iteratively removes the vertices on the outer cycle of the planar skeleton @xmath15 of @xmath0 .",
    "this partitions the vertices of @xmath0 into _ levels _ according to their `` distance '' from the outer face of the planar skeleton @xmath15 .",
    "vertices on the outer face of @xmath15 are at level 0 .",
    "deleting these vertices from @xmath15 yields the level 1 graph ; the vertices that lie now on the outer face are at level 1 . in general , the level @xmath21 graph is obtained by deleting all vertices at levels less than @xmath21 ; the vertices that lie on the outer face of this graph are at level @xmath21 .",
    "the edges of @xmath0 ( including the crossing edges ) are partitioned into _ level edges _ at level @xmath5 , edges that connect vertices at the same level @xmath5 , and _ binding edges _ , edges that connect vertices at different levels .",
    "the fact that a level @xmath5 vertex is not on the outer face after deleting the first @xmath22 levels implies that every level @xmath5 vertex lies in the interior of some cycle composed of level @xmath23 vertices .",
    "this means in particular that a level @xmath5 vertex can not be adjacent to a level @xmath24 vertex with @xmath25 and binding edges connect only consecutive levels .",
    "similar to yannakakis  @xcite we first place level 0 vertices in the clockwise order ( cw - order ) as they appear on the outer cycle , assigning the edges on the outer cycle on the same page .",
    "then we place the level 1 vertices and assign the following edges to some pages : ( i ) the level edges of each cycle on the outer boundary of the level 1 graph ( ii ) the binding edges between levels 0 and 1 ( iii ) the crossing edges either at level @xmath26 or binding between level 0 and 1 . level 1 vertices",
    "are placed in such a way that the vertices on each level 1 cycle are in the counterclockwise order ( ccw - order ) around the cycle .",
    "now the rest of the graph is in the interior of level 1 cycles .",
    "the algorithm takes each level 1 cycle in turn and lays out its interior in a similar way .",
    "we therefore next consider a _",
