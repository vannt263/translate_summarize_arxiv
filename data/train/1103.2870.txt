    "elliptic flow is one of the most important observables in relativistic energy heavy ion collisions .",

    "finite elliptic flow in a non - central collision is now regarded as a definitive signature of collective effect in relativistic energy nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , elliptic flow is best explained in a relativistic hydrodynamical model , rescattering of secondaries generates pressure and drives the subsequent collective motion . in a non - central collision , the reaction zone is asymmetric ( almond shaped ) , and pressure gradient is large in one direction and small in the other .",
    "the asymmetric pressure gradient generates the elliptic flow . as the fluid evolve and expands , asymmetry in the reaction zone decreases and a stage arise when reaction zone become symmetric and system no longer generate elliptic flow .",
    "elliptic flow is an early time phenomena .",
    "it is a sensitive probe to , ( i ) degree of thermalisation , ( ii ) transport coefficients and ( iii ) equation of state of the early stage of the fluid @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been successfully applied to analyse various experimental data in au+au collisions at rhic energy ( @xmath0=200 gev ) .",
    "hydrodynamical evolution of near ideal qgp fluid , with shear viscosity to entropy ratio @xmath40.1 , initialized to central energy density @xmath5 30 @xmath6 at initial time @xmath70.6 fm / c , is consistent with experimental elliptic flow in central and mid - central collisions @xcite .",
    "small viscosity is consistent with string theoretical calculation based on ads / cft correspondence @xcite that viscosity of a strongly interacting matter is bounded by the kss bound @xmath8 .",
    "one wonders about the viscosity to entropy ratio ( @xmath9 ) at lhc energy .",
    "present paradigm is that @xmath9 has a minimum , possibly with a cusp , around the critical temperature @xmath10 @xcite . since , at lhc , produced fluid will be at a higher temperature than the fluid at rhic , one expects higher value of @xmath9 at lhc .",
    "recently , alice collaboration measured charged particles elliptic flow in 10 - 50% pb+pb collisions at lhc energy , @xmath2=2.76 tev @xcite .",
    "differential elliptic flow in 10 - 50% collisions at lhc is also rather similar to that at rhic .",
    "integrated elliptic flow on the other hand increased by @xmath1130% .",
    "alice collaboration also measured charged particles multiplicity @xcite , @xmath1 spectra @xcite in pb+pb collisions . at lhc multiplicity increase by a factor of @xmath112.2 , though the centrality dependence is rather similar to that in @xmath2=200 gev au+au collisions .",
    "high @xmath1 suppression is also more at lhc energy . in 0 - 5% collisions , @xmath1 spectra of charged particle s",

    "increase of elliptic flow at lhc energy collisions has been predicted in several hydrodynamical and hybrid models . in @xcite",
    "it was predicted that flow will increase by 20 - 30% .",
    "some models also predicted decreased elliptic flow in lhc energy @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xcite , one of the present author predicted that at @xmath2=5 tev pb+pb collisions , elliptic flow will decrease by @xmath1115% .",
    "the prediction was based on several assumptions , which are incorrect as of now .",
    "for example , contrary to the present understanding that multiplicity increases with energy by a power law , in @xcite a logarithmic dependence was assumed .",
    "this led to much reduced multiplicity than observed experimentally .",
    "also , in @xcite , confinement - deconfinement transition was assumed to be 1st order , contrary to the present understanding that the transition is a cross - over .    in the present paper , in a viscous hydrodynamic model , we have analysed the alice data for the centrality dependence of the charged particles multiplicity , @xmath1 spectra in 0 - 5% collisions , centrality dependence of integrated and differential elliptic flow and extracted viscosity to entropy ratio for the fluid produced in @xmath2=2.76 tev pb+pb collisions .",
    "analysis indicate that the alice data on the centrality dependence of charged particles multiplicity and 0 - 5% @xmath1 spectra are best explained in ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "elliptic flow data on the otherhand demand viscosity .",
    "small viscosity @xmath3 is required if all the data sets are analysed simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we briefly explain the second order israel - stewarts theory of dissipative hydrodynamics .",
    "hydrodynamics equations are closed with an equation of state ( eos ) . in section [ sec3 ]",

    "relaxation equations for the dissipative fluxes are obtained from the entropy law , @xmath14 .",
    "equation of motion of the fluid is then obtained by solving simultaneously the conservation equations , e.g. energy - momentum and the relaxation equations for the dissipative fluxes . in @xmath2=2.76 tev",
    "pb+pb collisions , the central rapidity region is approximately baryon free and dissipative effect like conductivity can be neglected .",
    "we also neglect the bulk viscosity . in general bulk viscosity is much less than the shear viscosity .",
    "but in qcd , near the transition point bulk viscosity can be large @xcite .",
    "effect of bulk viscosity on elliptic was studied in @xcite .",
    "the effect is not large .",
    "we have also extended the code azhydro - kolkata to include bulk viscosity .",
    "preliminary results are reported in @xcite .",
    "we also find that inclusion of bulk viscosity marginally modify the spectra or elliptic flow .",

    "we have used some specific initial conditions , e.g. initial time @xmath44=0.6 fm , initial zero fluid velocity , hard scattering fraction 90% , boost - invariant shear stress tensor etc .",
    "all possible initial conditions are not explored . in @xcite , systematic uncertainty in @xmath9 due to various uncertainties in initial conditions was estimated as large as 175% .",
    "the presently extracted value @xmath3 will be even more uncertain , if all possible initial conditions are accounted for .",
    "in israel - stewart s second order theory of hydrodynamics , we have analysed alice data on the centrality dependence of charged particles multiplicity , integrated and differential elliptic flow , charged particles @xmath1 spectra in 0 - 5% collisions .",
