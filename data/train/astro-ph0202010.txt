    "most of the 6.4  kev line clumps show deep absorptions in excess to that toward the gc region , similar to the xrn , sgr  b2 ( murakami et al . 2000 ) .",
    "they hence are regarded as new xrn candidates .",
    "figure  [ abamba - e1_fig : fig2 ] is the 6.07.0  kev image around sgr  c superposed on the cs j=10 contours ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of sgr  c shows the neutral iron line and deep absorption .",
    "the iron line emission is shifted toward the gc side of the molecular cloud , as is found for the first xrn , sgr  b2 .",
    "therefore , we fitted the spectrum of sgr  c region with an xrn model . since the statistics is limited , we fixed the photon index to 2.0 ( @xcite ) and the equivalent width of the 6.4  kev line to 2.0  kev ( @xcite ) , expected value for xrne .",
    "the fitting is acceptable with the best - fit parameters shown in table  [ abamba - e1_tab : tab2 ] .",
    "thus , we confirmed the @xmath1 result that sgr  c is an xrn ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 found the 6.4  kev line emission near at the molecular cloud ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 observations revealed the x - ray structure has two clumps of no 9 and 10 .",
    "the 6.4 kev lines are mainly coming from no 9 , a filament lying along the southwest half of the cloud , hence may be fluorescence irradiated by a gc side source .",
    "another candidate of xrn , but may be unrelated to sgr a@xmath3 is an @xmath36-ellipse located near the active star forming region , the arches cluster at a distance of 8.5  kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral parameters show a strong neutral iron line and deep absorption , supporting the xrn scenario .",
    "the irradiating sources , however are likely active young stars in the arches cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find three x - ray bright stars with the total luminosity of a few @xmath37 , assuming a single temperature plasma .",
    "however the required luminosity to produce the diffuse 6.4 kev flux is a few @xmath38 , 10 times larger than that of the core stars .",
    "since x - rays from young stars are more active and variable in younger age , it is conceivable that big flares and/or bursts were more frequently occurred in the recent past than in the present .",
    "the other 6.4 kev clumps no 3 , 57 are located in between sgr a@xmath3 and the radio arc , and show no clear association with molecular clouds .",
    "hence the origin of these sources is puzzling .",
    "since the 6.56.7  kev line comes from highly ionized iron , we can infer that these clumps consist of hot plasmas .",
    "an x - ray shell no 1 is associated with a non - thermal radio source `` wisp '' ( @xcite ) , suggesting to be a part of the radio snr , ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we see diffuse x - rays filling in the east half of ( dotted circle in figure 1b ) , while the west half including no 1 may be behind the molecular cloud , hence is faint and/or largely absorbed in x - ray .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is well fitted with an nei model of a temperature @xmath39 kev , significantly higher than any other young snrs , but comparable to the diffuse emission prevailing in the whole gc region .",
    "together with the @xmath0 discovery of new x - ray snrs , ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) , we suspect that many other young x - ray snrs would be found in the further deep observations .",
    "these putative snrs may significantly contribute to the large scale diffuse x - rays near the gc .",
    "no 18 has a plume - like shape lying at the northwest of sgr a@xmath3 and perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the plasma temperature is lower than that in the gc .",
    "this source may not be a single snr but is likely to be an out - flow from the gc plasma .",
    "an attractive idea is that no 18 is a thermal jet emanating from the giant black hole sgr a@xmath3 .",
    "the presence of non - thermal radio filaments is one of the the most striking features in the gc region .",
    "they are all oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane , and are considered to be synchrotron emission in a strong magnetic field of @xmath401 mg .",
    "@xmath0 discovered non - thermal x - ray filaments from sgr a east ( no 2 ) and near the radio arc ( no 10 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "a hint of possible association with a weak radio filament is suggested for these x - ray filaments .",
    "we thus infer that the x - ray filaments are due either to the synchrotron emission or inverse compton in a relatively weak magnetic field , where the radio flux is rather faint .",
    "since no 10 is located at the east rim of the molecular cloud co  0.13@xmath110.13 , where the expanding cavity is interacting with the cloud ( @xcite ) , the fermi acceleration scenario is likely to produce high energy electrons . the synchrotron energy loss of high energy electrons may not be large , hence can emit even synchrotron x - rays",
    ". if the magnetic field is moderately weak , x - rays are more likely from the inverse compton process as proposed for the x - ray filament at the radio `` thread '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "no 11 is a faint x - ray belt running parallel to the galactic plane and probably extending to the other non - thermal filament no 4 .",
    "1 .   many diffuse x - ray clumps with different morphology are found from the gc region .",
    "2 .   the x - ray spectra are full of variety in line feature : iron lines of 6.4  kev , 6.56.7  kev , and line - less clumps . 3 .   the molecular clouds sgr  c and co0.13@xmath110.13 are likely xrne , irradiated by the past active sgr a@xmath3 ( murakami et al .",
    "the diffuse 6.4 kev x - rays near the arches cluster would be due to the irradiating of flaring young stars in the cluster .",
    "some of the other 6.4 kev clumps located in between sgr a@xmath3 and the radio arc regions show no clear association with molecular clouds , hence the origin is debatable .",
    "5 .   the 6.56.7  kev clumps may be young snrs , but the temperatures are higher than the usual snrs . 6 .",
    "the line - less clumps ( filaments ) would be either synchrotron or inverse compton x - rays in weaker magnetic field than those in the radio bright filaments .",
