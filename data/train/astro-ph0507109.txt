    "-6pt most work on diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in relativistic  shocks has been restricted to the ultra - relativistic  regime with magnetic fields assumed parallel to the shock normal . however , trans - relativistic  shocks are certain to be important in some sources and , in general , relativistic  shocks will have highly oblique magnetic fields . here",

    "we consider only particle acceleration in plane , unmodified ( i.e. , test - particle ) shocks where effects on the shock structure from superthermal particles are ignored .",
    "in contrast to nonrelativistic  shocks , the details of particle scattering strongly influence the superthermal particle populations produced in trans - relativistic  and ultra - relativistic  shocks ( see @xcite@xcite@xcite for example ) .",
    "unfortunately , these details are not known with any reliability so the results of all current models of dsa depend on the particular scattering assumptions made .",
    "we use a simple , parameterized model of particle diffusion ( described in detail in @xcite ) which we believe adequately describes the main features of particle transport . until a self - consistent theory of wave - particle interactions in relativisticshocks",
    "is produced , parameterization will be necessary .    -24pt",
    "-6pt the acceleration process is modeled with a monte carlo  simulation where thermal particles are injected far upstream and followed as they diffuse through the shock ( for full details , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "scattering is elastic and isotropic in the local plasma frame and the scattering mean free path @xmath4 in the local frame is proportional to the gyroradius @xmath5 . we simulate small - angle scattering by allowing the tip of the particle s fluid - frame momentum vector @xmath6 to undergo a random walk on the surface of a sphere . after a small time @xmath7 the momentum undergoes a small change in direction of magnitude @xmath8 within a maximum angle @xmath9 .",
    "if the time in the local frame required to accumulate deflections of the order of @xmath10 is identified with the collision time @xmath11 , @xcite showed that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time between pitch - angle scatterings .",
    "we take @xmath4 proportional to the gyroradius @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the electronic charge and @xmath16 is the local uniform magnetic field in gaussian units ) , i.e. , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a measure of the `` strength '' of scattering . the strong scattering limit , @xmath19 ,",
    "is called bohm diffusion and in this limit , cross - field diffusion is important . setting @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of gyro - time segments @xmath7 , dividing a gyro - period @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 .",
    "large values of @xmath21 result in `` fine '' scattering where it is assumed that magnetic field fluctuations exist on all scales so that @xmath8 can be arbitrarily small .",
    "the dsa distribution , @xmath24 , becomes independent of @xmath21 when it is large enough such that @xmath25 , otherwise large - angle scattering ( las ) effects become important .",
    "thus , the scattering properties of the medium are modeled with the two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath21 and , along with @xmath3 and @xmath26 , this yields , in the high mach number limit , four independent parameters characterizing dsa .",

    "the heavy solid curve in the right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] shows that for @xmath2 and @xmath19 , the canonical power law  is obtained .",
    "however , even with @xmath32 , @xmath24 can be much steeper than this for larger values of @xmath26 and @xmath18 .",

    "this expression , which assumes that the shock is parallel and that @xmath43 , depends only on the shock lorentz  factor and the compression ratio . the compression ratio must be determined independently . in fig .",

    "-6pt in nonrelativistic  shocks , the test - particle  power law from dsa depends only on the shock compression ; it is independent of the details of diffusion , on the strength of scattering , and on the obliquity ( i.e. , independent of @xmath21 , @xmath18 , and @xmath26 ) . in relativistic  shocks , particularly trans - relativistic  ones ,",
    "test - particle  spectra can depend strongly on these parameters .",
    "we have shown examples with various @xmath21 , @xmath18 , and @xmath26 and , in general , the power law  steepens if @xmath46 and/or @xmath47 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 determines the fineness of scattering and if @xmath21 is small enough so that @xmath36 , large departures from a power law  can occur and the spectrum can become harder than @xmath48 even for ultra - relativistic  shocks .",
    "in addition , as have shown that the simple analytic result given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wax ] ) @xcite matches our monte carlo  results for parallel shocks and when @xmath43 .",
    "the parameterization of diffusion used in the monte carlo  technique is useful for investigating the behavior of dsa in relativistic  shocks .",
    "it makes fewer approximations than analytic models and can cover a far larger dynamic range than any current particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation .",
    "nevertheless , the actual diffusion depends on the self - consistent  generation of magnetic turbulence by the accelerated particles and is inherently complex and has not been described adequately even for nonrelativistic  shocks ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the correct form for the magnetic power spectrum in self - generated , relativisticturbulence will not be known until pic simulations can perform this calculation .",
    "unfortunately , the treatment of these problems using pic codes is beyond current computing capabilities for three basic reasons :   to correctly describe cross - field diffusion and other physics of the viscous subshock , pic simulations must be done fully in 3-d @xcite@xcite .",
    "if 1- or 2-d simulations are used , cross - field diffusion , an essential element in dsa , is unrealistically suppressed ;   if electrons are to be understood , electrons and protons must be modeled simultaneously ( except for pair plasma shocks ) , and the simulation must treat widely disparate inertial scales , greatly adding to the run time ; and   in order for nonlinear effects to become apparent or field generation to occur on large scales , simulations must be run long enough in a large enough box with enough particles for a significant population of extremely energetic particles to be produced .",
    "the combination of these three requirements means that , while pic simulations can add to our knowledge of critical aspects of the injection problem and the start of magnetic field generation process ( e.g. , @xcite ) , they will not be able to model the injection and nonlinear  acceleration of electrons and ions to energies relevant to ultra - high energy cosmic rays or grbs until computers more powerful than exist today become available .",
    "while we have only discussed test - particle  acceleration , nonlinear  effects , where the accelerated particles modify the shock structure , may be important in relativistic  shocks ( see @xcite ) , and in fact , most models of @xmath37-ray bursts  assume that relativistic  shocks efficiently accelerate electrons . if this is the case , test - particle  spectra may not be good approximations .",
    "this is certainly true for dsa in trans - relativistic  shocks , where the harder intrinsic power law  will naturally lead to a nonlinear  feedback on the shock structure .",
    "nonlinear effects will also influence the distribution of energy between electrons and protons ( e.g. , @xcite ) and modify the shape of the distribution at low energies , i.e. , near the sharp peaks at @xmath49 in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ( i.e. , @xcite ) .",
    "these issues are critical for @xmath37-ray burst  models ."
