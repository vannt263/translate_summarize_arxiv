    "charged higgs bosons appear in the particle spectrum of a general 2-higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "we are concerned here with the case of a type ii 2hdm @xcite , possibly in presence of minimal supersymmetry ( susy ) , the combination of the two yielding the so - called minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . to stay with the higgs sector of the extended model , unless two or more neutral higgs states , @xmath7 ( the first two are cp - even or ` scalars ' whereas the third is cp - odd or ` pseudoscalar ' ) and @xmath8 , as three degrees of freedom are absorbed into the definition of the longitudinal polarisation for the gauge bosons @xmath9 and @xmath10 , upon their mass generation after ewsb . ]",
    "are detected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , only the discovery of a spinless charged higgs state would unquestionably confirm the existence of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since such a field has no sm counterpart . in the mssm ,",
    "e.g. , if @xmath11 and @xmath1 is below 10 or so , the only available higgs state ( @xmath12 ) is indistinguishable from the one of the sm : this is the so - called ` decoupling scenario ' or @xmath5 , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the up - type and down - type higgs doublets ( denoted by @xmath1 ) are the two parameters that uniquely define the mssm higgs sector at tree - level . ] .",
    "not surprisingly then , a lot of effort has been put lately , by theorists and experimentalists alike , in clarifying the higgs discovery potential of the lhc in the charged higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "( this is particularly true within the mssm scenario , where one could also exploit interactions between the higgs and sparticle sectors  @xcite in order to extend the reach of charged higgs bosons at the lhc , beyond the standard channels . )",
    "results are now rather encouraging , as charged higgs bosons could indeed provide the key to unveil the nature of ewsb over a large area in @xmath5 and @xmath1 , as they may well be the next available higgs boson states , other than the @xmath12 , provided @xmath1 is rather large ( above 10 or so ) .",
    "once the @xmath8 and @xmath12 higgs bosons will have been detected , the next step would be to determine their interactions with sm particles , among themselves and also with the other two neutral higgs states , @xmath13 and @xmath7 . while the measurement of the former would have little to teach us as whether one is in presence of a general type ii 2hdm or indeed the mssm , constraints on the latter two would certainly help to clarify the situation in this respect .",
    "in fact , triple - higgs vertices enter directly the functional form of the extended higgs potential and , once folded within a suitable higgs production process , may lead to the measurement of fundamental terms of the extended model lagrangian . as the @xmath8 states have a finite electro - magnetic ( em ) charge ,",
    "the first lagrangian term of relevance would be the one involving two such states and a neutral higgs boson : chiefly , the vertices @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath13.-vertex '' .",
    "] this requires the investigation of hard scattering processes with two charged higgs bosons in the final state , as their direct couplings to valence quarks in the proton would be very small , hence inhibiting processes like : e.g. , @xmath16 .",
    "a summary of all possible production modes of charged higgs boson pairs at the lhc in the mssm can be found in ref .",
    "three channels dominate @xmath17 phenomenology at the lhc : ( i ) @xmath18 ( via intermediate @xmath19 production but also via higgs - strahlung off incoming @xmath20 pairs )  @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath21 ( primarily via a loop of top and bottom ( s)quarks )  @xcite ; ( iii ) @xmath22 ( via vector boson fusion )  @xcite .",
    "corresponding cross sections are found in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for all phenomenologically relevant @xmath1 values",
    "it is essentially the first process which dominates .",
    "one important aspect should be noted here though , concerning the simulation of the @xmath20 component of the @xmath18 process , which can become the dominant contribution to the cross section of process ( i ) at very large @xmath1 values . in fact , the use of a ` phenomenological ' @xmath2-quark parton density , as available in most parton distribution function ( pdf ) sets currently on the market , requires crude approximations of the partonic kinematics , which result in a mis - estimation of the corresponding contribution to the total production cross section .",
    "( the problem is well known already from the study of the leading production processes of charged higgs bosons at the lhc , namely , @xmath23 and @xmath24 : see , e.g. ,  @xcite . ) in practice , the @xmath2-(anti)quark in the initial state comes from a gluon in the proton beam splitting into a collinear @xmath20-pair , resulting in large factors of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the factorisation scale .",
    "these terms are then re - summed to all orders , @xmath27 , in evaluating the phenomenological @xmath2-quark pdf . in contrast , in using a gluon density while computing the ` twin ' process ( iv ) @xmath0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] for the associated feynman graphs ) , one basically only includes the first terms ( @xmath28 ) of the corresponding two series , when the @xmath2 and @xmath29 in the final state are produced collinearly to the incoming gluon directions .",
    "it turns out that , for @xmath30 , as it is the case here if one uses the standard choice of factorisation scale @xmath31 , the re - summed terms are large and over - compensate the contribution of the large transverse momentum region available in the gluon - induced case . in the end ,",
    "differences between the two cross sections as large as one order of magnitude are found , well in line with the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , if one considers that two @xmath32 splittings are involved here .",
    "one way to reconcile the large differences in the cross section for the two processes , @xmath0 and @xmath33 , is to use a significantly lower factorisation scale , as argued in  @xcite for similar processes . following the suggestion in part a.1 .  of  @xcite , we look at the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath2-quarks in the process @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fact ] , to get an indication of the most suitable factorisation scale for @xmath33 . from the figure",
    "we see that a proper choice for the latter , when @xmath34 gev , is of the order @xmath35 gev ( at this point the distribution reaches about half of its `` plateau '' value production mode @xmath24 , as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the ` threshold mass ' @xmath38 . ] ) rather than , e.g. , @xmath39 .",
    "using such a lower scale we do get a much better agreement between the leading order ( lo ) cross sections for the two processes , as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : fact ] in the case of the mssm specified below ( @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 ) if the renormalisation scale ( @xmath42 ) is also changed accordingly .",
    "however , one should also bear in mind that both processes are subject to possibly large qcd corrections and that the choice of ( factorisation and/or renormalisation ) scales that minimises the differences between the two descriptions in higher orders of @xmath17 production may alternatively be viewed as the most suitable one . or else , one may arguably choose a scale that minimises the size of the higher order corrections themselves in either process independently of the other .",
    "all such additional values may eventually turn out to be different from the one extracted from tab .  [",
    "tab : fact ] .",
    "such exercises in higher orders can not unfortunately be performed in the present context , as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the two processes of interest are unavailable . yet",
    ", some guidance may be afforded again by the study of the single charged higgs production modes already referred to .",
    "in fact , nlo corrections to @xmath43 were first computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and then later confirmed in  @xcite . following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is clear that a choice for the renormalisation scale @xmath42 as low as the one recommended for the factorisation one @xmath26 is not sustainable for @xmath44 at nlo , no matter the choice for the latter : see fig .  5 of  @xcite .",
    "besides , if one fixes , e.g. , @xmath45 but varies @xmath26 , the minimal difference between the nlo and the lo results for @xmath44 is found at large @xmath26 , at values around or even larger than @xmath46 ( again , see fig .  5 of ref .",
    "be the most suitable combination of scales as it may , we take here a pragmatical attitude and use the standard setup @xmath47 throughout , as this corresponds to the most conservative choice in terms of the overall normalisation for @xmath0 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : fact ] )  as it becomes minimal  and keeping in mind that its cross section can be up to a factor @xmath48 larger depending on the choice of factorisation and renormalisation scales .",
    ".cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath33 as functions of the factorisation ( @xmath26 ) and renormalisation ( @xmath42 ) scales ( at leading order the @xmath33 cross section does not depend on @xmath42 ) in the mssm specified below ( @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : lambda ]    to get an explicit example of the large differences between the more general 2hdm we are considering and the mssm , we compare the two using @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 as input values , as we will do below . in this case",
    "we get @xmath49 gev in the 2hdm instead of the mssm value , @xmath50 gev . with the value of @xmath51 not being much larger than @xmath52",
    "the difference in effective coupling @xmath53 is more than a factor hundred and as we will see below it has a large impact on the magnitude of the cross section .",
    "( the @xmath13 widths will of course be different too in the mssm and 2hdm just described : their effects have been included in the numerical analysis . )    as intimated already in sect .",
    "[ sec : hh ] , a non - running @xmath2-quark mass was adopted for both the kinematics and the yukawa couplings : @xmath54 gev .",
    "for the top parameters , we have taken @xmath55 gev with @xmath56 computed according to the model used ( in the limit @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 gev in both the 2hdm and mssm scenarios considered here ) .",
    "ew parameters were as follows : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 gev ( @xmath62 gev ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 gev ) .",
    "for the @xmath3-lepton mass we used @xmath65 gev , whereas all the other leptons and quarks were assumed to be massless .",
    "the integrations over the multi - body final states have been performed numerically with the aid of vegas  @xcite , metropolis  @xcite and rambo  @xcite , for checking purposes .",
    "finite calorimeter resolution has been emulated through a gaussian smearing in transverse momentum , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 for all jets and @xmath68 for leptons .",
    "the corresponding missing transverse momentum , @xmath69 , was reconstructed from the vector sum of the visible momenta after resolution smearing .",
    "furthermore , we have identified jets with the partons from which they originate and applied all cuts directly to the latter , since parton shower and hadronisation were not included in our study .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath3-lepton decay which has been taken into account using the pythia  @xcite mc event generator .    as default pdfs",
    "we have adopted the set mrs98lo(05a )  @xcite with @xmath70 as factorisation / renormalisation scale for both signal and background .",
    "the same scale entered the evolution of @xmath71 , which was performed at one - loop , with a choice of @xmath72 consistent with the pdf set adopted .",
    "in fact , we have verified that the spread in the inclusive cross sections , for both signal and background , as obtained by using the five different parameterisations of mrs98lo and also cteq4l  @xcite was within @xmath73 of the values quoted for mrs98lo(05a ) in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the signature that we are then considering is in practice : @xmath74 wherein the two @xmath2-jets from the hard process are actually defined as the two most forward / backward ones that also display a displaced vertex .    we have assumed a standard detector configuration by imposing acceptance and separation cuts on _ all _ light - quark ( including @xmath75 s ) and @xmath2-jets , labeled as @xmath76 and @xmath2 , respectively , as follows : @xmath77 the two most forward / backward @xmath2-jets ( with pseudorapidities of opposite sign ) are further required to yield @xmath78 for their invariant mass . for @xmath3-jets",
    "( we only consider hadronic decay modes ) we impose : @xmath79 the setup corresponds to the standard atlas / cms detectors .",
    "presently it is not clear to what extent this setup will also be applicable for the same apparata in the context of the super lhc ( slhc ) option  @xcite .",
    "having now excluded the two most forward / backward @xmath2-jets from the list of jets , we impose hadronic @xmath10- and @xmath80-mass reconstruction : @xmath81 where the two light - quark jets entering the last inequality are of course the same fulfilling the first one .",
    "finally , the missing transverse momentum should be : @xmath82    the combined effects of these cuts on the signal ( [ signal ] ) in the mssm and 2hdm models is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bbhh_cuts ] and [ fig : newbbhh_cuts ] respectively in the case of retaining the finite width effects using off - shell masses for the @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "( the difference when instead using the nwa is very small and this option is therefore not shown . ) as can be seen from the figures the effects of the cuts on the magnitude of the cross sections is quite severe . on the other hand the cuts",
    "are needed ( especially in case of the mssm ) in order to beat down the background as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_cuts ] . from the figure it is also clear that the signal cross section reaches its maximum around @xmath83 gev and that the magnitude of the signal varies by up to 2 orders of magnitude depending on which model we are considering .",
    "it should also be noted that in the 2hdm setup we are using it was not possible to go above @xmath84 gev ( corresponding to @xmath85 gev ) due to the unitarity contraints  @xcite . in the following we will be considering the case @xmath86 gev ( corresponding to @xmath40 gev ) in more detail .    after the above cuts have been implemented and the jet momenta assigned",
    ", one can reconstruct the would - be charged higgs boson mass , by pairing the three jets entering the equation in the right - hand side of ( [ cuts4 ] ) with the left - over central jet , a quantity which we denote by @xmath87 . the corresponding mass spectrum is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hmass_cuts ] for our two customary setups of mssm and 2hdm , assuming @xmath88 gev and @xmath41 as representative values .",
    "the figure shows clear peaks at the charged higgs boson mass for the signal on top of a combinatorial background in both models whereas for the background process there is no such peak .",
    "thus , by selecting events with @xmath89 we can get an additional discrimination against the background .    furthermore , using the visible @xmath3-jet momentum and the missing transverse one , it is possible to reconstruct the transverse mass , as @xmath90 with @xmath91 the relative angle between the two momenta , a quantity which is ultimately correlated to the actual value of the mass resonance yielding @xmath92 pairs ( @xmath93 in the signal and @xmath94 in the background ) .",
    "we show this observable in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmass_cuts ] ( where it is denoted by @xmath95 ) , again , for our two customary setups of mssm and 2hdm . from the figure it is clear that the transverse mass for the signal in the two models extends all the way out to @xmath96 . comparing with the background , which starts to drop quite drastically around @xmath97 ,",
    "we see that it is advantageous to introduce a cut on the transverse mass of the order of @xmath98 this gives a very strong suppression of the background whereas the signal is only mildly affected .    after having reconstructed the two charged higgs bosons and applied the respective cuts ( [ m4cut ] ) and ( [ mtcut ] ) we can form the ( effectively , transverse ) mass @xmath99 of the combined two charged higgs boson system , giving the possibility to look for possible resonances . as can be seen from the magnitudes of the cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : hhmass_cuts ] the selection outlined above gives a very clear signal in the 2hdm case with essentially no background , whereas in the mssm case the signal is still clear but very small .",
    "of course , the cuts could be tightend to give a very clear signal also in the mssm case , but the absolute cross section would then be even smaller . from the figure it is also clear that there is a significant difference in shape between the two models , with the 2hdm showing a clear enhancement for @xmath100 gev due to the resonant contributions .",
    "however , given the limited statistics that will be available at the lhc , it is not clear to what extent the difference in shape alone can be used to extract any information about possible @xmath101 resonances and the corresponding coupling .",
    "in addition the difference in shape will be smaller if the width of the @xmath13 higgs boson is larger and/or the detector resolution is worse than what we have assumed .",
    "as we have shown , it is possible to outline a selection procedure that enables one to extract a signal of heavy charged higgs pair production in association with two @xmath2-quarks at @xmath4 in extensions of the standard model with two higgs doublets of type ii . in a general case",
    "the mass relations in the higgs sector may be favourable such that a sizeable signal would appear already at the lhc through the resonant channel @xmath102 .",
    "however , in the mssm the resonance is not accessible over the allowed parameter region and the non - resonant contributions turn out to be very small making it difficult to extract a signal even after upgrading the luminosity at lhc by a factor ten ( slhc ) .",
    "the large difference in cross section between the mssm and a more general 2hdm shows that indeed the pair production of charged higgs production is sensitive to the @xmath103 coupling even though it will probably be difficult to reconstruct a resonant transverse mass peak mainly due to the limited statistics and possibly also due to the finite detector resolution .",
    "in our study we have not included effects of the @xmath2-tagging efficiency .",
    "on the one hand , requiring four @xmath2-tags will give a sizeable reduction ( of the order of a factor ten ) of the signal as well as the backgrounds .",
    "on the other hand , the selection procedure outlined above was designed to get a signal in the case of the mssm leading to unnecessarily tight cuts for the general 2hdm case .",
    "furthermore , being a leading order calculation , the cross section we get for the signal is also sensitive to the choice of factorisation and renormalisation scales . if we , instead of using the standard choice of the invariant mass of the hard subsystem , use the mean transverse mass of the two @xmath2-quarks in the @xmath104 process as scale , the cross section increases by a factor 5 .",
    "such a scale choice also gives a better agreement with the cross section for the ` twin ' process @xmath105 . in order to get a better handle on the uncertainties due to scale choices a next - to - leading order calculation",
    "will eventually be necessary .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that our results already call for the attention of atlas and cms in further exploring the scope of the ( s)lhc in reconstructing the form of the higgs potential in extended models through signals of charged higgs boson pairs . besides , in presence of parton shower , hadronisation and detector effects , one may also realistically attempt exploiting @xmath3-polarisation techniques in hadronic decays of the heavy lepton @xcite in order to increase the signal - to - background rates , an effort that was beyond the scope of our parton level analysis .",

    "<S> we study the process @xmath0 at large @xmath1 , where it represents the dominant production mode of charged higgs boson pairs in a type ii 2-higgs doublet model , including the minimal supersymmetric standard model . the ability to select this signal would in principle enable the measurements of some triple - higgs couplings , which in turn would help understanding the structure of the extended higgs sector . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a selection procedure that should aid in disentangling the higgs signal from the main irreducible background . </S>",
    "<S> this exploits a signature made up by ` four @xmath2-quark jets , two light - quark jets , a @xmath3-lepton and missing energy ' . while , for @xmath4 and over a significant @xmath5 range above the top mass , a small signal emerges already at the large hadron collider after 100 fb@xmath6 , ten times as much luminosity would be needed to perform accurate measurements of higgs parameters in the above final state , rendering this channel a primary candidate to benefit from the so - called ` super ' large hadron collider option , for which a tenfold increase in instantaneous luminosity is currently being considered .    </S>",
