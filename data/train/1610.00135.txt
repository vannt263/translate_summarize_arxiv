    "in the phenomenon of charge superradiance , a classical charged scalar field wave incident on a reissner - nordstrm black hole is scattered with a reflection coefficient of greater than unity if the frequency , @xmath0 , of the wave satisfies the inequality @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the charge of the scalar field and @xmath3 is the electrostatic potential at the event horizon of the black hole . by this process",
    ", the charged scalar field wave extracts some of the electrostatic energy of the black hole .",
    "if a charged scalar field wave satisfying ( [ eq : chargesr ] ) is trapped near the event horizon by a reflecting mirror of radius @xmath4 , the wave can scatter repeatedly off the black hole , and is amplified each time it is reflected .",
    "this can lead to an instability ( the `` charged black hole bomb '' ) where the amplitude of the wave grows exponentially with time @xcite , providing the scalar field charge @xmath2 and mass @xmath5 satisfy the inequality @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the radius of the event horizon and inner horizon of the black hole .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : instabcond ] ) ensures that the area of the event horizon increases as the scalar field evolves @xcite , and implies that for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath5 , the mirror radius @xmath4 must be sufficiently large for an instability to occur .",
    "physically , the scalar field wave must extract more charge than mass from the black hole , so that the black hole evolves away from extremality .    what is the ultimate fate of this charged black hole bomb instability ? to answer this question , it is necessary to go beyond the test - field limit and consider the back - reaction of the charged scalar field on the black hole geometry .",
    "recently , we studied static , spherically symmetric , black hole @xcite and soliton @xcite solutions of einstein charged scalar field theory in a cavity , in the case where the scalar field mass @xmath5 is set equal to zero . for both soliton and black hole solutions",
    ", the scalar field vanishes on the mirror .",
    "we examined the stability of these charged - scalar solitons and black holes by considering linear , spherically symmetric , perturbations of the metric , electromagnetic field , and massless charged scalar field . in the black hole case @xcite",
    ", we found that if the scalar field has no zeros between the event horizon and mirror , then the black holes appear to be stable . on the other hand ,",
    "if the scalar field vanishes inside the mirror then the system is unstable .",
    "the situation for solitons is more complex @xcite .",
    "even if the scalar field has no zeros inside the mirror , there are some solitons which are unstable .",
    "the unstable solitons have small mirror radius and large values of the electrostatic potential at the origin .",
    "in @xcite we conjectured that the stable black holes with charged scalar field hair could be possible end - points of the charged black hole bomb instability .",
    "this conjecture has been tested recently @xcite by evolving the fully coupled , time - dependent , spherically symmetric , einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon equations in a cavity .",
    "starting from a reissner - nordstrm black hole in a cavity with a small charged scalar field perturbation , the system evolved to a hairy black hole in which some of the charge of the original black hole was transferred to the scalar field .    for a massless",
    "charged scalar field , the work of @xcite confirms our conjecture in @xcite - the ultimate fate of the charged black hole bomb is an equilibrium black hole with scalar field hair .",
