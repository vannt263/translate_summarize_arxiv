    "<S> in a scenario with two almost mass degenerate heavy sterile majorana neutrinos with a mass @xmath0 gev , we present the semileptonic decay widths of heavy charged pseudoscalars such as @xmath1 mesons , either lepton - number - violating ( @xmath2 ) , or lepton - number - conserving ( @xmath3 ) , mediated by such on - shell neutrinos . it had been explained in the literature that such decays may be eventually detected , and that they can present even detectable cp violation effects . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we point out that , in addition , such decays may present detectable effects of heavy neutrino oscillation , allowing us to extract the oscillation length and thus the heavy neutrino mass difference @xmath4 , as well as a cp - violating majorana phase . </S>"
