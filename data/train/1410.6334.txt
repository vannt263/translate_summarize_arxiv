    "the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn , hereafter ) relates the abundance of the light elements created in the early universe with key cosmological parameters such as the baryon energy density @xmath2 or the number of relativistic species @xmath3 .",
    "given a set of cosmological parameters , bbn can theoretically predict the primordial abundances with great accuracy and these predictions can then be compared to the observational measurements for an overall test of the theory .",
    "the primordial abundance of light elements is generally measured with astrophysical observations ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , by looking at regions in the universe free from contamination from stellar nucleosynthesis or taking in account the depletion or accretion of the elements abundances due to these processes . in the last years several efforts were made in order to achieve a robust treatment of systematics , in order to obtain stronger and reliable constraints on these measurements  @xcite .",
    "+ most of the focus is on the primordial values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and , in general , there is a good agreement between the values of the cosmological parameters inferred from each measurement , with the exception of @xmath6 ( there is , indeed , a tension for what concerns the value of @xmath6 that needs still to be explained , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "recently ,  @xcite measured the @xmath5 abundance with impressive accuracy from a metal poor damped lyman alpha system ( dla ) , namely the qso sdss j1419 + 0892 . in this work ,",
    "the following value for deuterium abundance is given : @xmath7 ( statistical and systematic 1@xmath8 errors ) .",
    "summing in quadrature the errors , as also done in  @xcite , one obtains for the d abundance a @xmath9 c.l .",
    "constraint of @xmath10 .",
    "previous measurements of the @xmath5 abundance are listed in  @xcite , that derives a mean value from them of @xmath11 , showing an error that is almost 5 times larger than that of pettini @xmath12 cooke .    another indirect way to accurately measure the primordial elements",
    "is based on the determination of the baryon density through measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy angular power spectrum and to then derive the primordial abundances by assuming standard bbn .",
    "the recent measurements made by the planck satellite mission sampled the cmb power spectrum with very high accuracy up to very small angular scales , at multipole @xmath13  @xcite and provided new , more stringent , bounds on the baryon density , with @xmath14 .",
    "this value , under the assumption of standard bbn , as explained below , brings to a constraint on the primordial deuterium abundance of @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) , with a central value that is more than two standard deviations away from the value reported in @xcite .    the tension is therefore not highly statistically significant , taking into account small systematics that could clearly be present both in the cmb and deuterium measurements .",
    "moreover , as pointed out in @xcite , the experimental value of the radiative capture reaction @xmath16 , used in bbn codes as ` parthenope ` code  @xcite and that converts deuterium into helium , is in disagreement with ab initio theoretical calculations , based on models for the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions .",
    "systematic may therefore be also present in fits of present experimental data in the bbn energy range ( @xmath17 - @xmath18 kev ) .",
    "however , it is certainly timely and interesting to investigate if any deviation from the theoretical assumed model could better accommodate the two determinations , i.e. to consider the tension as a possible hint for new physics and assuming that systematics are under control in current experimental measurements .    the aim of this paper is to study in detail the correlations between the primordial abundance of deuterium , derived by the planck data under the assumption of standard bbn , and other , non standard , cosmological parameters .",
    "we will therefore first identify the non - standard parameters that could bring the planck @xmath5 value in more agreement with the value reported by @xcite .",
    "the subsequent , natural , step will be to include the direct @xmath5 measurement in the analysis and to derive constraints on the non - standard parameters for combined planck+@xmath5 measurements .    furthermore , planck results show some discrepancy with previous experiments as wmap  @xcite , act  @xcite , spt  @xcite on the values of key cosmological parameters ( i.e. matter density , lensing amplitude or number of relativistic species in early universe ) , as studied in  @xcite .",
    "therefore it s interesting to explore whether a change in the @xmath5 abundance can help to solve this tensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 1 we describe the data analysis method , in section 2 we report the results of our analysis , while in section 3 we draw our conclusions .",
    "our main cmb dataset consists in the planck public data release of march 2013 @xcite .",
    "we use the combination of planck temperature data plus wmap9 polarization at low@xmath19 ( planck+wp ) to evaluate the abundances of light nuclei produced during the big bang nucleosynthesis , in particular @xmath5 .",
    "these abundances are obtained using the ` parthenope ` code  @xcite , as a function of the baryon density @xmath20 and the number of relativistic species @xmath3 .",
    "this code uses values for nuclear reaction rates , fundamental constants and particle masses that leads to a theoretical error for the obtained light elements abundances .",
    "the obtained values are compared with the @xmath5 abundance measured by direct astrophysical observations made by pettini @xmath12 cooke  @xcite .",
    "+ for the analysis method we use the publicly available monte carlo markov chain package ` cosmomc ` @xcite which relies on a convergence diagnostic based on the gelman and rubin statistic .",
    "we use the latest version ( march 2013 ) which includes the support for the planck likelihood code v1.0 ( see http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/ ) and implements an efficient sampling of the space using the fast / slow parameters decorrelation @xcite .",
    "we first consider the @xmath0cdm model varying its six parameters : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath23 , the re - ionization optical depth @xmath24 , the scalar spectral index @xmath25 , and the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath26 at @xmath27 .",
    "we consider purely adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .",
    "we fix also the number of neutrinos , assumed massless , at the standard value @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "+ subsequently we study several extensions to the standard model , considering @xmath1 new parameters : the amplitude of the lensing power @xmath29  @xcite , the equation of state parameter for the dark energy @xmath30 , the ratio between tensor and scalar perturbations @xmath31 , the running of the spectral index @xmath32 , the curvature parameter @xmath33 , the mass and number of neutrinos @xmath34 and @xmath3 and the parameter for iso - curvature perturbations @xmath35 .",
    "we consider @xmath36 theoretical frameworks by combining different choices of parameters .",
    "we first consider the @xmath0cdm model to evaluate the @xmath5 abundance from the cmb temperature anisotropies . by making use of the `",
    "parthenope ` bbn code , one can obtain the value of @xmath5 in function of @xmath37 and @xmath3 . by using @xmath28 and the result for @xmath37 from planck",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath5 : @xmath38 .    comparing this value with the one obtained by direct observations of pettini @xmath12 cooke , @xmath10",
    ", we get a tension at @xmath39 . as discussed in the previous section , in order to further investigate this tension , we consider @xmath36 new models , extensions of the standard one , and determine the new distributions for @xmath40 . in table",
    "[ table:1 ] are reported the values of @xmath40 for each case considered in our analysis .",
    "we can summarize our results by identifying three different classes :    1 .   in models where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are free to vary",
    "there is no variation ( or at least a very small variation ) in the planck values of deuterium with respect to the standard model .",
    "these extensions of the @xmath0cdm model , indeed , do not affect significantly the @xmath37 value , resulting in a negligible change of the @xmath5 predicted value ( see table [ table:1 ] ) .",
    "2 .   in models with @xmath29 or @xmath43 as free parameters we see a strong variation with respect to the standard model and we obtain values of deuterium that are now in good agreement , even within @xmath44 , with the value of pettini @xmath12 cooke ; 3 .   in the two models in which @xmath45 and @xmath3 are free to vary the new deuterium distributions are even further away from the one obtained by pettini @xmath12 cooke with respect to the standard model . clearly",
    ", a planck+@xmath5 analysis does not prefer a non - zero neutrino mass or a non - standard value for @xmath3 .",
    "the posterior distributions of deuterium are reported , for all the considered models , in fig.[fig : ap1]-[fig : ap3 ] .",
    "table i +      to better understand the impact of @xmath5 on cosmological parameters we use importance sampling technique to include the pettini @xmath12 cooke @xmath46 measurement to our analysis . in this way chains are weighted imposing a gaussian prior on @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , we obtain new deuterium distributions that are more in agreement with the values of pettini @xmath12 cooke , as expected . however , the interesting part are the shifts in the values of the other parameters .",
    "we find interesting deviations and we report the mean values obtained in tables [ table:2]-[table:6 ] .",
    "in [ table:2 ] we show the results for the @xmath0cdm@xmath47 case : the lensing amplitude parameter is shifted to even higher values with respect to the standard expectation of unity , while the other parameters move towards a general better agreement with wmap results , showing in particular an higher value for @xmath37 .",
    "the same effect is seen in the @xmath0cdm@xmath48 case , reported in [ table:3 ] : also here we can see that the extra parameter @xmath49 tends to depart from the standard value of zero , although pushing the other parameters towards the wmap values .",
    "the results for the extra parameters are plotted in fig.[figure:1 ] . for what concerns",
    "the combinations of two parameters , in [ table:4 ] we report the values obtained by simultaneously varying @xmath45 and @xmath29 where we recover again a better agreement with wmap results for all the parameters but @xmath29 , which seems to move toward values even higher with respect to the case of [ table:2 ] .",
    "the extra parameters posteriors for this case are plotted in fig.[figure:2 ] . when @xmath41 and @xmath31 are free to vary we do not see particular deviations for the running of the spectral index , while the tensor to scalar ratio has a slightly higher value ( table [ table:5 ] , fig.[figure:3 ] ) .",
    "finally we report in table [ table:6 ] the mean values for the last combination , which includes as free parameters @xmath41 , @xmath31 and @xmath49 .",
    "as expected , the introduction of the deuterium prior does not alter the parameters , given the fact that the cmb estimation in this case is in perfect agreement with the pettini @xmath12 cooke measurement .",
    "the biggest variation is on the value of @xmath31 that now results different from zero at one @xmath8 .",
    "refer to fig.[figure:4 ] for the distributions of extra parameters .",
    "in this paper we analysed the hint for a tension on the current estimates of the primordial deuterium abundance obtained indirectly by the planck cmb measurements and directly by pettini @xmath12 cooke . clearly",
    "this hint disappears when taking into account the more conservative estimation for the @xmath5 abundance value from  @xcite .",
    "moreover we also warn the reader that experimental systematics in the determination of nuclear rates relevant for bbn codes could also be present as showed in @xcite .",
    "a full agreement is found when @xmath50 and @xmath49 are simultaneously let free to vary .",
    "we have found that the variation of other parameters lead to negligible modifications in the cmb constraints on primordial @xmath5 .    the current tension between the direct measurement of the d abundance and the indirect",
    ", model dependent , cmb bounds can possibly be explained by the introduction of new physics .",
    "it will be the duty of future data , as , for example , the one expected from the planck 2014 release that should provide improved constraints on the baryon density , to further confirm the presence of this tension .",
