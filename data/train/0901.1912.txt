    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix  @xcite elements @xmath6 represent the couplings of the charged current @xmath7 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks . in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions , the violation is a consequence of the irreducible phase in this @xmath10 unitary matrix .",
    "the main objective of the pep - ii -factory and the  detector  @xcite at slac is to determine the parameters in the ckm matrix at high precisions in as many ways as possible .",
    "if no single set of parameters can satisfy all measurements , one can conclude that new physics beyond the sm that contributes to violation exists .",
    "the most commonly used unitarity condition of the ckm matrix is @xmath11 , which forms a triangle on the complex plane .",
    "its angles and sides represent the more poorly known parameters of the ckm matrix . in this report",
    ", we present some recent updates on the angles ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 )  $ ] is not discussed here due to limited space . ] , and the magnitudes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the angles @xmath3 and @xmath4 are measured from time - dependent asymmetries in neutral meson decays .",
    "the asymmetry , arising from the interference between decays with and without @xmath14-@xmath15 mixing process , is proportional to @xmath16 , where is the difference between the proper decay times of the two s in @xmath5 decays , and is the @xmath14-@xmath15 mixing frequency .",
    "neutral decays to eigenstates containing a charmonium and a @xmath17 mesons , which are dominated by tree - diagram processes , provide a direct measurement of  @xcite . to a very good approximation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the sm ( @xmath20 is the eigenvalue ) .",
    "we update the analysis of these decay modes using the full  @xmath5 data set ( 465 million ) and obtain @xmath21 and @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the charmless decays dominated @xmath23 penguin diagrams provide opportunities to probe new heavy particles in the loops .",
    "we update @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite analyses , as well as @xmath26  @xcite using the full  @xmath5 data set . in all cases , @xmath27 is consistent with that from @xmath28 final state , indicating that large new physics effects in the @xmath23 penguin loops are unlikely .",
    "the angle @xmath4 can be measured by studying modes such as @xmath29 , etc .",
    "because of the sizeable contribution from penguin diagram with a different weak phase , the @xmath30 term is modified to @xmath31 .",
    "the correction @xmath32 can be resolved with an isospin analysis  @xcite .",
    "updates the @xmath33  @xcite ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and @xmath36  @xcite analyses .",
    "the branching fraction @xmath37 leads to @xmath38 at 90% confidence level . combining s @xmath39 results , we obtain @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the rates of semileptonic decays of mesons to charm and charmless final states are proportional to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . for @xmath43",
    "we exploit the partial decay rate as a function of kinematic variables to determine the decay rate and the form factor at zero recoil point , at which the form factor suffers from the least theoretical uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "we update the analysis of exclusively reconstructed @xmath44 with the second fully reconstructed in hadronic decay modes and obtain @xmath45  @xcite , where the last error is due to the theoretical uncertainty in the form factor .",
    "we also perform a global fit using @xmath46 decays to simultaneously determine the branching fractions of @xmath47 , and form factor slopes ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) in a heqt - based parameterization . from them",
    "we obtain @xmath50 using @xmath51 and @xmath52 using @xmath53  @xcite .    for @xmath1 , we measure branching fractions of @xmath54 , with the other decays semileptonically , in three bins of momentum transfer @xmath55 .",
    "we derive @xmath1 using several theoretical form factor calculations and find the value varies between @xmath56@xmath57 with total error of about 15%  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive method suffers from large @xmath43 background .",
    "experimental sensitivity comes from phase space region where @xmath43 is kinematically suppressed .",
    "however , extracting @xmath1 from a limited phase space suffers from theoretical uncertainties from nonperturbative shape functions .",
    "we update the inclusive @xmath58 measurement with the second fully reconstructed in hadronic decay modes .",
    "@xmath1 is extracted by fitting distributions of @xmath55 , mass and momentum of the @xmath59 system .",
    "the results range from @xmath60@xmath61  @xcite , depending on models .",
    "experimental uncertainty is approximate 7% .",
    "because top quark is heavier than mesons , @xmath62 is only accessible through loops in decays , either through -@xmath63 mixing , or @xmath64 penguin diagrams .",
    "we measure the branching fractions of @xmath65 using the full  data set and find @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68  @xcite .",

    "we find @xmath71 .",
    "this value is consistent with the result from @xmath72 mixing ( @xmath73 )  @xcite from cdf and d0 collaborations . even though it is less precise than the results from mixing , radiative penguin channels provide a nice independent confirmation .",
    "ended its @xmath5 program in late 2007 . within a year , has updated many measurements related to the angles and sides of the ckm unitarity triangle .",
    "there are no significant contradictions among the measurements under the ckm description of the standard model ."
