    "the heavy hadrons consisting of a charm quark are quite distinct in their properties from the light flavored hadrons composed of up ( @xmath9 ) , down ( @xmath10 ) , and strange ( @xmath11 ) quarks . the presence of the heavy quark in heavy flavor hadrons provides an additional handle for the understanding of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of the strong interaction . the large mass of the charm quark introduces a mass scale much larger than the confinement scale @xmath12 mev . in contrast , the energy scale of the lighter quarks is @xmath13 .",
    "the presence of two scales in such systems naturally leads to the construction of an effective theory where one can actually calculate a big portion of the relevant physics using perturbation theory and renormalization - group techniques .",

    "the charm hadrons are ideal candidates to test and apply the predictions of hqet .    in this context , the investigation of the production of heavy flavor hadrons is of great interest . since the discovery of @xmath14 in 1974  @xcite , the production of charmonium ( @xmath15 ) states has been extensively studied experimentally in hadroproduction ( tevatron)(see , eg . the reviews  @xcite ) , photo- and electro - production ( hera ) ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "these studies have contributed substantially to enhance our understanding of the charm meson states , their spectroscopy , and decays .",
    "the first charmed baryon states were detected in 1975 in neutrino interactions @xcite . since then , many new excited charmed baryon states have been discovered by the cleo  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite , and belle  @xcite facilities ( ref .",
    "@xcite provides a good review of the older studies ) .",
    "however , the production and spectroscopy of the charmed baryons have not been explored in the same detail as the charmonium states , although they can provide similar information about the quark confinement mechanism .",
    "in fact , due to the presence of three quarks ( two light and one heavy ) , the structure of the charmed baryon is more intriguing and complicated .",
    "in contrast to mesons , there can be more states as there are more possibilities of orbital excitations .",
    "most of the current experimental information about the production of the ground state charmed baryon [ @xmath18 has been derived from the electron - positron annihilation experiments . in the near future , charmed baryon production will be studied in the proton - antiproton ( @xmath19 ) annihilation using the `` antiproton annihilation at darmdtadt '' ( @xmath20 ) experiment at the facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) in gsi , darmstadt ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the advantage of using antiprotons in the study of the charmed baryon is that in @xmath19 collisions the production of extra particles is not needed for charm conservation , which reduces the threshold energy as compared to , say , @xmath21 collisions .",
    "the beam momenta of antiprotons in this experiment will be well above the threshold ( 10.162 gev@xmath22 ) of the @xmath23 reaction .",

    "the solid line represents their coherent sum . ]    to explore the origin of the domination of the @xmath3 exchange contributions , we note the relative strong coupling to the vector meson vertices , particularly for the tensor coupling term .",
    "as can be seen from table i , the ratio of tensor to vector coupling is 3.26 .",
    "this analogous to the large tensor coupling for the @xmath99 meson in the one - boson - exchange models of the @xmath100 interaction  @xcite , where the tensor to vector ratio is even larger ( 6.1 ) . in fig .  5 , we show the individual contributions of the vector and tensor terms to the total @xmath3 exchange cross section .",
    "clearly , the tensor coupling terms make the dominant contribution to the @xmath3 exchange part of the total cross section .",
    "the interference of vector and tensor coupling terms is destructive as the total @xmath3 cross sections are lower than the individual contribution of the tensor term . at the effective lagrangian level ,",
    "the strong tensor contribution is associated with the additional momentum dependence induced by the derivative coupling in the tensor interaction [ see eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] .",
    "a comparison of our results with those of the previous studies would be of interest in the planning of the future experiments for the charm baryon production at the @xmath20 facility .",
    "for this purpose , we chose the @xmath92 of 15 gev/@xmath8 .",
    "for this beam momentum , results for the total cross section of the @xmath82 reaction have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , which are approximately 100 , 1.2 , and 60 nb , respectively .",
    "these values are drastically lower than the corresponding cross section predicted in our study . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are in close agreement with those of refs .",
    "@xcite even though they have given predictions for the cross section only for near - threshold beam momenta .",
    "thus , even when considering the variation in values predicted in our model due to the unconstraint initial and final state distortions and the ansatz of the form factor at various vertices , the differences between our cross sections and those of refs .",
    "@xcite are substantial for beam momenta relevant to the @xmath20 experiment .",

    "the differential cross section ( dcs ) provides more valuable information about the reaction mechanism .",

    "their strongly different characteristics in different angular regions become very apparent . while the @xmath2 exchange terms are large in the backward directions , those of the @xmath3 exchange are forward peaked .",
    "we also note that , while there is destructive interference among the two exchange terms at back angles , they are strongly constructive in the forward directions . even though the individual @xmath2 exchange contributions are small at the forward angles , they play an important role in the total cross sections through the interference terms .",

    "the solid lines represent their coherent sum . ]",
    "in summary , we studied the @xmath101 reaction using a phenomenological effective lagrangian model that involves the meson - baryon degree of freedom .",
    "the detailed dynamics of the process is accounted for by the @xmath1-channel @xmath2 and @xmath3 exchange diagrams , while largely phenomenological initial and final state interactions have been used to account for the distortion effects .",
    "the coupling constants at various vertices have been taken from the @xmath49 and @xmath48 scattering studies reported in refs .",
    "the off - shell corrections at the vertices are accounted for by introducing monopole form factors with a cutoff parameter of 3.0 gev , which was taken to the same for all the cases .",
    "this ansatz for the form factor and the value of the cutoff parameter @xmath89 have been checked by fitting the data on the @xmath102 reaction measured by the isr collaboration  @xcite in ref .",
    ". a further check on the input parameters of our model is performed by taking over the same coupling constants and the form factor to describe the data on @xmath103 reaction under the assumption of su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "of course , the value of the cutoff parameter can not be taken over , as the masses of the exchanged mesons for this reaction are much smaller .",
    "we used a @xmath89 of 1.7 gev for this case in line with the choice of refs .",
    "our calculations provide a good description of the data for this reaction .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath104 vary between 1 and 8 @xmath7 at near - threshold beam momenta ( excess energy between 1 and 100 mev )",
    ". this value agrees with that reported in the coupled - channels meson - exchange model calculations of refs .  @xcite . for higher beam momenta ,",
    "the cross sections are larger .",
    "they peak around a @xmath92 of 15 gev/@xmath8 with a peak value of around 30 @xmath71 b. this value is drastically larger than the cross sections for this reaction predicted in previous calculations . since these earlier calculations have used different types of models , which by and large invoke the quark degrees of freedom in their calculations , it is difficult to locate the reason for the large difference between them and our results .",
    "this will be understood when the @xmath20 experiment performs these measurements once the fair facility is operational . if the cross sections are as large as predicted in our calculations as well as in those of refs",
    ".  @xcite , it would be relatively easy to measure them at the @xmath20 experiment .",
    "we noted that the vector meson ( @xmath3 ) exchange terms dominate the cross sections for all beam momenta except for those very close to the production threshold .",
    "the reasons for the large strength of this exchange process are the strong tensor coupling of the vector mesons ( similar to the large tensor coupling of the @xmath99 meson in @xmath100 interactions ) , and the additional momentum dependence introduced by the derivative part of the corresponding interaction .",
    "although , except for the very - close - to - threshold beam momenta , the individual contributions of the @xmath2 exchange terms are relatively weak , they contribute significantly through the interference terms .",
    "we found that different meson - exchange processes contribute in different angular reasons of the differential cross sections , which are generally forward peaked both at lower as well as higher beam momenta .",
    "it was noted that while the @xmath2 exchange terms dominate in the backward directions , @xmath3 exchange processes are relatively large in the forward angular region .",
    "the constructive interference between these two exchange processes leads to more forward peaking of the cross sections .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath2 exchange terms alone yield backward - peaked differential cross sections .",
    "the initial and final state interactions are the important ingredients of our model .",
    "we treat them within an eikonal approximation - based phenomenological method .",
    "generally , the parameters of this model are constrained by fitting to the experimental data . because of the lack of any experimental information , it has not been possible to test our model thoroughly .",
    "therefore , there may be some uncertainty in the absolute magnitudes of our cross sections . nevertheless , we reproduce the data for the @xmath105 production channel , and our near - threshold cross sections for the @xmath34 production are very close to those of refs .",
    "@xcite , where distortion effects have been treated more rigorously within a coupled - channels approach .",
    "therefore , the large cross sections obtained in our calculations at larger beam momenta as compared to those of previous authors are robust and can help in planning of the experiments to measure this channel at the @xmath20 facility .",
