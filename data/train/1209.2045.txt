    "the two - dimensional toda lattice is an important integrable system with many aspects .",
    "it is an example of a nonabelian chern - simons theory in classical field theory ( see @xcite ) , and in differential geometry it can be interpreted as the equation for primitive harmonic maps taking values in a compact flag manifold ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "such maps are closely related to harmonic maps into symmetric spaces .",
    "these in turn have many geometrical interpretations , e.g.   surfaces in @xmath1 of constant mean curvature ( see @xcite ) , or special lagrangian cones in @xmath2 ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we shall be concerned with the two - dimensional periodic toda lattice with opposite sign .",
    "this is the system @xmath3 where @xmath4 is some open subset of @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the first manifestation of the integrability of this system is its zero curvature formulation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 in other words , ( [ ost ] ) is the compatibility condition @xmath12 $ ] for the linear system @xmath13 the fact that @xmath14 involve only @xmath15 leads to holomorphic data for solutions of ( [ ost ] ) .",
    "we recall from section 4 of @xcite that the holomorphic data is a matrix of the form @xmath16 where each @xmath17 is a holomorphic function .    for radial solutions of ( [ ost ] )",
    ", i.e.  when @xmath18 depends only on the real variable @xmath19 , ( [ * ] ) reduces to @xmath20 this can be regarded as the equation for an isomonodromic deformation , which is another  perhaps more famous  manifestation of integrability , and a well known approach to studying equations of painlev type ( see @xcite,@xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "namely , if we impose the ( euler - type ) homogeneity condition @xmath21 we obtain @xmath22 which is a meromorphic o.d.e .  in @xmath23 with poles of order two at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "writing @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27 the compatibility condition of the linear system @xmath28 is the radial version @xmath29 $ ] ) of ( [ ost ] ) .    from the connection point of view",
    ", the homogeneity assumption ( [ ho ] ) extends the flat connection @xmath30 to a flat connection @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "it is well known that in this situation the @xmath33-system ( [ muequation ] ) is isomonodromic , i.e.  its monodromy data is independent of @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , starting from ( [ muequation ] ) , one may seek its isomonodromic deformations ( see @xcite ) , and this leads back to ( [ xequation ] ) .",
    "the monodromy data of ( [ muequation ] ) consists of formal monodromy and stokes matrices at each of the two poles , as well as a connection matrix relating them .",
    "locally , solutions of the radial version of ( [ ost ] ) correspond to such data .",
    "however this kind of data is in general difficult to compute explicitly , and global properties of the corresponding solution are difficult to read off",
    ".    we shall impose the following anti - symmetry condition  @xmath35 for some @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath37 ( equivalently @xmath38 ) , this means that @xmath39 for all @xmath40 ; in this case ( [ ost ] ) and ( [ as ] ) is the system studied by cecotti and vafa in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in general we call ( [ ost ] ) and ( [ as ] ) together with the radial assumption the _",
    "tt*-toda equations .",
    "_    in this article we shall identify all solutions of the tt*-toda equations which are smooth on the maximal  domain @xmath41 .",
    "they constitute a @xmath42-dimensional family . we shall give simple and explicit parametrizations of this family in terms of asymptotic data , holomorphic data , and monodromy data .",
    "in section [ interp ] we explain the important geometrical and physical motivation behind this description .    to end this section",
    ", we mention that equations ( [ * ] ) and ( [ as ] ) possess the following symmetries , which will play an important role in our computation of the monodromy data .",
    "they depend on the three automorphisms @xmath43 of @xmath44 which are defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 namely , it is easily verified that the connection form @xmath49 has the following properties .",
    "_ cyclic symmetry : _ @xmath50    _ anti - symmetry : _ @xmath51    _ reality : _",
    "@xmath52    the cyclic property expresses the shapes of the matrices in ( [ * ] ) , the anti - symmetry property is just condition ( [ as ] ) , and the reality property corresponds to the fact that every @xmath53 is real .",
    "the differential geometric or lie - theoretic meaning of the three symmetries , and the proof of the following result , can be found in section 2 of our previous article @xcite .    from any solution of the system ( [ ost ] ) and ( [ as ] ) we obtain a harmonic map @xmath54 .    more generally , it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the tt * equations are  locally  the equations for ( pluri)harmonic maps into @xmath55 , together with a homogeneity condition ( which amounts to the radial condition in our situation ) .",
    "this is the basis for the geometric interpretation of the tt * equations , as @xmath55 is the space of inner products on @xmath56 .",
    "a solution of the tt * equations can thus be regarded as a ( trivial ) vector bundle of rank @xmath57 on @xmath4 equipped with a metric satisfying various natural conditions .",
    "in fact it is a ( trivial ) harmonic bundle in the sense of @xcite with an additional real structure and homogeneity property .    such bundles ( not necessarily trivial ) have been well studied .",
    "they generalize variations of polarized hodge structures , and they appear in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite in connection with semi - infinite variations of hodge structures , pure polarised terp structures , or noncommutative variations of hodge structures .",
    "a special role is played by those bundles which arise from geometry , e.g.  from variations of polarized hodge structures on specific manifolds .",
    "the relation with the discussion of the previous section is as follows .",
    "the magical  solutions of the tt * equations predicted by cecotti and vafa are expected to be    \\(1 ) globally defined on @xmath58 ,    \\(2 ) characterized by initial / asymptotic conditions ,    \\(3 ) and have integral stokes data .",
    "we shall refer to such solutions as field - theoretic .",
    "many of them appear to be of algebro - geometric origin , i.e.  the corresponding field theories are constructed from unfoldings of singularities ( landau - ginzburg models ) or from quantum cohomology ( nonlinear sigma models ) .",
    "cecotti and vafa predicted the existence of the global solutions on the basis of the physical interpretation of the monodromy data and holomorphic data : the stokes data counts solitons at the infra - red point  @xmath59 and the holomorphic data encodes chiral charges at the ultra - violet point  @xmath60 .",
    "these are fixed points for the renormalization group flow , and it is this flow that is governed by the tt * equations . for the physical  solutions the data at @xmath60 and @xmath59 should have integrality properties .",
    "thus , it has been predicted that the tt * equations admit certain globally smooth  solutions with extremely rich geometrical meaning .",
    "our results confirm this prediction in the case where @xmath61 reduce to two independent functions ( in this situation @xmath62 , @xmath63 , or @xmath64 ) .",
    "first , in this case , we describe all solutions of the tt*-toda equations satisfying property ( 1 ) .",
    "the fact that such solutions are in one to one correspondence with asymptotic data at @xmath60 can be proved by using a monotone iteration scheme based on @xcite .",
    "this technique is well known for nonlinear scalar p.d.e . , but novel for systems .",
    "then , by computing the monodromy data and holomorphic data explicitly , we shall verify properties ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) .",
    "the solutions with integer stokes data will be discussed in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "we remark that the holomorphic data is familiar to differential geometers as the generalized weierstrass representation , or dpw representation , of a harmonic map .",
    "the link between the p.d.e .",
    "solution and the holomorphic data is given by the iwasawa factorization @xmath65 of a certain loop group valued function @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) .",
    "this is explained in detail in section 4 of @xcite .",
    "it is here that the crucial difference between the toda equations and the tt*-toda equations can be seen . for the toda equations , it is easy to construct solutions with properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , because the relevant lie group is the compact group @xmath68 , and in this case the iwasawa factorization @xmath65 holds on the entire domain of @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , for the tt*-toda equations we have the noncompact group @xmath69 , and the iwasawa factorization @xmath65 holds ( in general ) only on some open subset @xmath70 of the domain @xmath4 of @xmath66 .",
    "proving that @xmath71 is equivalent to proving that the solution of the p.d.e .",
    "has no singularities , and this is what we shall do .",
    "the same factorization problem arises in the construction of other types of harmonic maps with important differential geometric interpretations ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "as few examples are known where global existence can be proved in the noncompact case , our examples are of interest in this wider context .    a detailed statement of results",
    "is given in section [ results ] .",
    "in section [ pdetheorem ] we prove the basic existence theorem ( theorem a ) , and in section [ stokes ] we compute the monodromy data of the solutions ( theorem b ) .",
    "all methods used in this article are low - tech , and our proofs are essentially self - contained . we hope that this will contribute to a better understanding of the tt * equations , which have been treated until now only by indirect methods .",
    "this article can be read independently of @xcite , although our proof of theorem a will make reference to @xcite in order to avoid repetition . in @xcite",
    "we constructed a family of globally smooth solutions of the tt*-toda equations , and we identified a finite number of field - theoretic solutions  amongst them . in this article",
    "we complete the picture by constructing _",
    "all _ globally smooth solutions , and we describe _ all _ field - theoretic solutions .",
    "we do this only in the case where @xmath61 are equivalent to two unknown functions ; the general case will be treated in a subsequent article . in @xcite",
    "we give an independent proof of the existence of solutions , from the isomonodromy point of view .",

    ", we obtain @xmath334 thus , @xmath335 is a formal solution of the same type as @xmath336 , so it must be equal to @xmath336 .",
    "this completes the proof ( and shows that @xmath337 ) .",
    "the stokes phenomenon depends on the fact that ( [ 4ode ] ) admits a holomorphic solution @xmath338 on some region of the form @xmath339 with asymptotic expansion @xmath320 whenever @xmath340 is sufficiently small , i.e.   _ if the sector is sufficiently narrow . _",

    "_ namely , if @xmath341 are two such solutions , then @xmath342 for some constant @xmath343 , and we have @xmath344 the desired conclusion @xmath345 would follow if , for any @xmath346 , there exists a path @xmath347 in the sector such that @xmath348 since @xmath349 , a sufficient condition is that the path satisfies @xmath350 . if the sector contains a ray @xmath351 with @xmath352 , then @xmath353 can be made positive or negative within the sector , so we have both @xmath354 and @xmath355 . such a ray",
    "is called a stokes ray .",
    "stokes rays are said to have the same type if their arguments differ by @xmath356 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath345 if the sector contains _ at least _",
    "one stokes ray of each type .",
    "it is a nontrivial fact that a solution @xmath338 exists on the sector if the sector contains _ at most _ one stokes ray of each type ( this is the meaning of sufficiently narrow ) . a sector which contains exactly one stokes ray of each type",
    "is called a stokes sector .",
    "thus we have the fundamental principle ( theorem 1.4 of @xcite ) that there is a unique solution @xmath338 with asymptotic expansion @xmath320 on any stokes sector .",
    "explicitly , the condition @xmath352 means that @xmath357 , i.e.@xmath358 , @xmath359 , and this simply means @xmath360 .",
