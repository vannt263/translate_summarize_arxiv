    "the difference in peak @xmath34 values of the two observations , after scaling for exposure time , is not great enough to claim that the pulsed fraction has changed .",
    "the variance in measured power as a function of intrinsic power was treated by @xcite , and is summarized in figure  1 of that paper ( with the difference that groth s power is actually our @xmath50 ) .",

    "we used the timing parameters to combine the pulse profiles of the two observations , adjusting their relative phase to maximize @xmath34 in the combined data .",
    "the folded light curves in a range of energies between 0.5 and 10  kev are shown in figure  [ fig : pulse ] , where they are background - subtracted and normalized to 1 in each energy band .",
    "the single - peaked pulse shape and its phasing appears to be independent of energy , while the pulsed fraction increases from @xmath54 at the lowest energy to @xmath55 at the highest .",
    "however , the pulsed fractions shown in figure  [ fig : pulse ] are definitely lower limits , as the source extraction circle includes an unknown number of counts from the pwn to the northeast and , to a lesser extent , from the jet , while the circle used for background subtraction ( figure  [ fig : pnimage ] ) does not correct for this contamination .",
    "although the effect is difficult to quantify , it probably accounts for the apparent increase in pulsed fraction with energy in figure  [ fig : pulse ] , as the pwn has a softer spectrum than the pulsar ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the intrinsic pulsed fraction is therefore likely to be @xmath58 at all energies . in support of this interpretation",
    ", we find that when we decrease the radius of the extraction aperture from @xmath20 to @xmath59 , the pulsed fraction becomes @xmath55 at all energies .",
    "knowing the spin - down power of psr j1101@xmath06101 , we reexamine the structure of its apparent bow - shock nebula to obtain an independent estimate of the space velocity of the pulsar . for this purpose ,",
    "the higher resolution of _ chandra _  is more useful than _ xmm - newton_. our analysis here follows and extends that of @xcite , who used a 5  ks _ chandra_observation ( obsid 12420 ) with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer .",
    "here , we revisit the 49.4  ks _ chandra_acis - i observation ( obsid 13787 ) that was presented by @xcite . figure  [ fig : chandra ] shows the region of this image containing the pulsar and pwn , with each photon in the @xmath60  kev band indicated by a dot . because the pulsar was located only @xmath618 from the optical axis , the spatial resolution for the pulsar and its immediate surroundings is nearly optimal .",
    "6101  and its pwn from the 49.4  ks observation of @xcite .",
    "superposed is the @xcite equation of the contact discontinuity between the shocked pulsar wind and the shocked ism , fitted by eye .",
    "the parameters are the position angle of motion , @xmath62 , and the radius of the apex , or stagnation point , which is @xmath63  cm ( @xmath64 ) from the pulsar . the inclination angle @xmath65 of the velocity vector with respect to the plane of the sky is assumed to be @xmath66 .",
    "]    for the case of an isotropic wind from a star moving supersonically through a uniform ism , @xcite derived an analytic expression for the surface of contact discontinuity between the shocked pulsar wind and the shocked ism using momentum conservation , @xmath67^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath68 is the polar angle with respect to direction of motion , @xmath69 is the distance of the surface from the star , and @xmath70 is the stagnation radius , the distance of the apex of the surface from the pulsar .",
    "the shape of the contact discontinuity is thus parameterized entirely in terms of @xmath70 , which in turn is determined in this case by the pulsar wind power , assumed to be @xmath71 , the velocity @xmath72 of the pulsar , and the ambient density @xmath73 of the ism , using momentum balance : @xmath74    the assumption we make in graphing the model curve in figure  [ fig : chandra ] is that the x - ray emission comes from the shocked pulsar wind , which is bounded by the contact discontinuity and the termination shock interior to it .",
    "therefore , @xmath70 was chosen by eye so that the curve surrounds the bulk of the emission trailing the pulsar .",
    "it was assumed that the pulsar is moving nearly in the plane of the sky ( @xmath75 ) , both because of the narrow opening angle of the nebula , and the evidently large tangential velocity .",
    "the parameters of the curve are @xmath63  cm ( @xmath64 ) , where @xmath76 is the distance in units of 7  kpc , and the position angle of the motion , @xmath62 .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite . now substituting the values of @xmath70 and @xmath9 , equation ( 1 )",
    "is reduced to @xmath77  km  s@xmath2 , where @xmath78 is the ism hydrogen density in units of 0.1  @xmath79 .",
    "this velocity is @xmath80 times less than the estimates from the snr age , but they can be reconciled if the local density is @xmath81  @xmath79 .",
    "the result is largely unaffected by the unknown angle @xmath65 , because any inclination of the model would broaden the apparent opening angle of the bow shock , which would then have to be reduced by decreasing @xmath70 , thus increasing @xmath72 .",
    "however , before giving this analysis too much credence , note that there are at least two discrepancies between the simple model and the detailed properties of the data .",
    "first , there is no evidence of emission from the apex of the shocked wind , which theoretically should be the brightest part of the nebula .",
    "in fact , there is no excess emission within @xmath82 of the pulsar , a zone that is entirely consistent with a single point source @xcite .",
    "second , the faint x - ray emission just behind the pulsar does not in fact follow the model curve , but is confined to a narrower cone , while the brightest regions filling the curve are @xmath83 behind the pulsar .",
    "the appearance is of a diverging flow getting brighter with distance from the pulsar , rather than a collimated one that is fading .",
    "similar phenomena have been noted in the x - ray images of other pulsar tails ; the possible implications will be discussed in section  [ f : structure ] .",
    "various estimates of the distance to msh  11@xmath06_1_a  were reviewed by @xcite , who concluded from their own co maps that @xmath84  kpc , in agreement with 6.9  kpc from optical emission - line velocities @xcite , and @xmath17  kpc from 21  cm absorption @xcite .",
    "these are all kinematic distances , unlike the x - ray modelling of @xcite , who derived @xmath85  kpc .",
    "we have adopted 7  kpc as the most likely distance .",
    "since the characteristic age of psr j1101@xmath06101  is greater than all estimates of the age of msh  11@xmath06_1_a , we can assume that it was born in the snr and estimate its birth period @xmath86 from the relation @xmath87,\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the braking index .",
    "most pulsars have @xmath89 @xcite . for this range , and letting @xmath90 be the @xmath7  kyr age of the snr",
    ", we find @xmath8  ms .",
    "psr j1101@xmath06101  should not be confused with psr j1105@xmath06107 , a 63.2  ms pulsar with @xmath91 erg  s@xmath2 and @xmath92  kyr that is @xmath93 southeast of msh  11@xmath06_1_a .",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that psr j1105@xmath06107  was born in msh  11@xmath06_1_a , although psr j1101@xmath06101  is now a more compelling association .",
    "the dispersion measure of 271  pc  @xmath79 to psr j1105@xmath06107converts to a distance of 5.0  kpc according to the galactic electron density model of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding free - electron column of @xmath94  cm@xmath27 , assuming a typical ionized fraction of 0.1 @xcite , is accompanied by a neutral column of @xmath96  cm@xmath27 , which is consistent with the x - ray measured @xmath97  cm@xmath27 to igr j11014@xmath06103  @xcite .",
    "x - ray measurements of @xmath98 to msh  11@xmath06_1_a  are somewhat contradictory , ranging from @xmath99  cm@xmath27 @xcite to @xmath100  cm@xmath27 @xcite . allowing for this ambiguity ,",
    "all three objects are probably consistent with being at the same distance .",
    "psr j1105@xmath06107  is not detected in x - rays . using archival _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations totaling 23.7  ks ( obsids 2780 and 4380 ) , we set a @xmath101 upper limit of @xmath102 erg  cm@xmath27  s@xmath2 on its @xmath103  kev flux , corresponding to @xmath104 .",
    "this is close to the minimum of the distribution of similarly aged pulsars @xcite . a previously claimed detection of this pulsar using _ asca _ @xcite may have instead detected a neighboring star that is present in the _ chandra _  images .      with @xmath3 erg  s@xmath2 ,",
    "psr j1101@xmath06101  is the least energetic of the 15 rotation - powered pulsars detected by _ integral _  ( for the full set see @xcite ) .",
    "these are among the most energetic pulsars , comprising half of all those known with @xmath105erg  s@xmath2 , the latter value belonging to psr b1951 + 32 , which has a characteristic age of 107  kyr and was previously the least energetic of the _ integral _  pulsars .",
    "the @xmath10  kev flux of igr j11014@xmath06103  is @xmath106 erg  cm@xmath27  s@xmath2 @xcite , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath107  erg  s@xmath2 that is 4% of the spin - down luminosity of psr j1101@xmath06101 .",
    "this exceeds the combined @xmath103 kev flux of the pulsar , the pwn , and the jet as measured by _",
    "chandra _ , which total @xmath108 erg  cm@xmath27  s@xmath2 @xcite , or 0.8% of the spin - down flux .",
    "the flat spectrum of the pulsar must extend into the hard x - rays , where it is responsible for most of the @xmath10  kev flux . using equipartition arguments",
    ", @xcite estimated that a minimum power of @xmath109 erg  s@xmath2 is needed for the jet , which is @xmath110 of the spin - down luminosity .",
    "this is important evidence that a large part of a pulsar s spin - down power can be focussed into a narrow polar jet , a fraction therefore not available to power a bow shock .",
    "the absence of x - rays from the head of the putative bow shock is the principal challenge to the model in which the termination shock of the pulsar is the cause of the pwn emission .",
    "a dark region between the termination shock and the contact discontinuity is difficult to understand in the context of shock acceleration . for reasonable values of the magnetic field strength ( @xmath111  g ) and x - ray emitting electron energy ( @xmath112  ev )",
    ", the gyroradius , @xmath113  cm , is much smaller than the stagnation radius , @xmath63  cm .",
    "so the particles should be easily confined and accelerated .",
    "the cavity _ interior _ to the termination shock should be dark , so that any emission from around it should be limb brightened .",
    "the termination shock will close behind the pulsar at a distance @xmath114 , which is larger than its forward radius , @xmath115 . in analytic and numerical models at low mach number @xmath116 ,",
    "the relation between these radii is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the adiabatic index of the ambient medium , usually 5/3 @xcite .",
    "however , numerical models at high @xmath116 show that this ratio saturates at about 5 @xcite .",
    "while an area @xmath119 long behind psr j1101@xmath06101  is relatively dim in x - rays , the emission there looks like a narrow cone rather than the expected limb - brightened bow shock . nevertheless , if we ignore this detail and assume that this is the region bounded by the termination shock , then @xmath120 and @xmath116@xmath121 .",
    "the sound speed in the warm ( 8000  k ) phase of the ism is @xmath122  km  s@xmath2 , which then implies a pulsar velocity of only @xmath123  km  s@xmath2 , at odds with the other estimates . only if the ism is hot ( @xmath124  k ) do we get @xmath125  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "but this would require reducing the ambient density drastically to have a reasonable pressure , which would be inconsistent with the results from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the `` tongue''of emission just behind psr  j1747@xmath02958 ( the mouse ) and others represents the surface of the termination shock .",
    "but these are bright regions , which contradicts the theory that there should be no emission interior to the termination shock . in the case of psr j1101@xmath06101 ,",
    "this region is at least underluminous , although not limb - brightened .",
    "another system like psr j1101@xmath06101  in which trailing emission brightens with distance from the pulsar is psr  j0357 + 3205 @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in modeling that tail as a synchrotron emitting bow shock led the authors to propose shocked - heated bremsstrahlung emission instead . but",
    "that model requires a hot ism phase with an extraordinarily large pressure .    in several pulsar tails , radio and x - ray brightness",
    "are anticorrelated , with the radio increasing with distance from the pulsar @xcite .",
    "this is the case for psr j1101@xmath06101  as well @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear if this phenomenon relates to why the region closest to psr j1101@xmath06101  is underluminous in both radio and x - ray .",
    "considering that the spin axis of psr j1101@xmath06101  may be orthogonal to its velocity vector , with a large fraction of the spin - down power going into the jet , one may ask if the remaining wind is primarily polar or equatorial , and how that would affect the structure of the pwn .",
    "however , numerical models with anisotropic pulsar winds , including an equatorial one , do not significantly change the shape of the termination shock @xcite .",
    "so far , no model within the framework of ideal mhd appears to explain the features of our data and others .",
    "an alternative model @xcite in which particles are accelerated by magnetic reconnection outside the speed - of - light cylinder results in a fast `` magnetotail '' behind the pulsar , which may contain a large fraction of the energy of the pulsar wind and extend to large distances",
    ". an interesting feature of this model is the flared `` trumpet '' shape of the magnetotail ( figure 4 of @xcite ) , which does in fact resembles the pwn of psr j1101@xmath06101 .",
    "an approximation for the radiation length of the magnetotail is @xmath126 assuming @xmath127  @xmath79 and @xmath128  km  s@xmath2 , this reduces to @xmath129  pc ( @xmath130 ) , the actual length of the pwn .",
    "however , the authors only investigated the case in which the magnetic axis , the rotation axis , and the velocity are all parallel , while there is good reason to believe that the rotation axis of psr j1101@xmath06101  is nearly orthogonal to its velocity because of the orientation of the jet .",
    "it is not clear if a more realistic geometry would generate undesirable , non - axisymmetric features .",
    "we discovered the 62.8  ms  pulsar psr j1101@xmath06101  in igr j11014@xmath06103 .",
    "its spin - down luminosity of @xmath31 erg  s@xmath2  is the lowest among the 15 rotation - powered pulsars detected by _",
    "integral _ , and an order - of - magnitude less than what was anticipated from the x - ray luminosity of psr j1101@xmath06101  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a large scatter among pulsars in efficiency of x - ray emission .",
    "its 116  kyr  characteristic age is consistent with an origin in msh  11@xmath06_1_a  for any reasonable value of the braking index or snr age , with its birth period close to its present period .",
    "the velocity of the pulsar inferred from fitting the shape of its cometary nebula is compatible with estimates of @xmath131  km  s@xmath2 from the snr age and distance , if the density of the ambient ism is @xmath132  @xmath79",
    ". the density should be this low if psr j1101@xmath06101  is within a cavity blown by previous stellar winds or supernovae . because the structure of the nebula differs in important details from a basic bow - shock geometry ,",
