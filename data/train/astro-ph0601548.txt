    "paper  1 @xcite examined the ability of the fir - continuum to @xmath0 line intensity ratio to diagnose dust and molecular gas physical conditions .",
    "specifically , the _ cobe / dirbe _ 140@xmath3 and 240@xmath3 continuum data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were compared with the nagoya 4-m @xmath0 spectral line data for the orion  a @xcite and b molecular clouds .",
    "the @xmath4 ratio , or @xmath5 , was plotted against the 140@xmath3/240@xmath3 dust color temperature , or @xmath6 , for the high signal - to - noise positions ( @xmath7 for 140@xmath3 , 240@xmath3 , and @xmath0 ) in the orion clouds .",
    "this plot was modeled with lte and lvg , one - component models and lvg , two - component models ; the two - component models fit the data better than the one - component models at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "tables  1 , 2 , and 3 of paper  i list the resultant parameter values of the two - component model fits .",
    "the most noteworthy result is that the two - component models demand the dust - gas temperature difference , @xmath1 , to be zero within @xmath8 or 2@xmath2k .",
    "( note that in the case of the two - component , two - subsample models , the @xmath9k subsample still yields @xmath10 _ if _ a two - component model is fitted to that subsample .",
    "the listed results in table  2 of paper  i are those of the one - component model fitted to the @xmath9k subsample . ) this result has important consequences that were briefly mentioned in paper  i and will be discussed in detail in paper  iii @xcite . consequently , the reliability of the derived @xmath1 must be tested .    in all of the modeling mentioned in paper  i ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties of the derived parameter values were evaluated by applying scale factors to the data .",
    "these systematic uncertainties are related to uncertainties in the calibration and in certain assumptions , such as the dust optical depth to gas column density ratio .",
    "the combined effect of these uncertainties was estimated to be @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , scale factors that varied from 0.6 to 1.4 were applied to the data to see how strongly the resultant parameter values would change .",
    "also , the starting search grid for the two - component models was slightly shifted and re - run .",
    "the magnitudes of the changes in the results provided another test of the systematic uncertainties in the parameter values .",
    "these two tests gave similar estimates of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "these systematic uncertainties are demonstrated in figure  21 of paper  i , which shows that the column densities per velocity interval and densities of both components are uncertain by factors of a few or by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "( these uncertainties are orders of magnitude larger than the formal uncertainties obtained from the model fits .",
    "accordingly , the latter uncertainties can be ignored . )",
    "while the abovementioned tests provide rough estimates of the reliability of the results , they do _ not _ measure any biases inherent in the method .",
    "in other words , the range of possible parameter values that result from the modeling and from the tests _ may not even include the `` true '' or correct value .",
    "_ and we can not know that these ranges are indicative of the correct values , because we can not know the correct values in the first place .",
    "this is in stark contrast to using simulated data . with simulated data , the true , or input , values",
    "can be compared with the resultant values from the model fits .",
    "the tests that were applied to modeling the actual observed data can be repeated on the modeling of the simulated data .",
    "biases or shortcomings in the modeling technique are then clearly seen . in the following section and its subsections , the creation of the simulated data and the results of modeling these data",
    "is described .",
    "other systematics are not discussed in the current paper , but are left to paper  iii .",
    "these are the systematic effects that result when the models do not properly characterize the contributions of other phases of the ism , such as from hi and its dust or from some large - scale foreground / background emission , or when they adopt an improper value of some more basic physical parameter , such as the far - ir spectral emissivity index , @xmath12 .",
    "to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of determining gas and dust physical conditions using the ratio of the fir continuum to the @xmath0 line , simulated data were created .",
    "the simulations assumed that the real clouds are composed of two components : a component 0 and a component 1 .",
    "the former has constant physical conditions ; i.e. , they do not vary from one line of sight to another .",
    "the latter also has constant physical conditions , except for the dust and gas temperatures ( i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "the component-1 temperatures vary from line of sight to line of sight , but maintain a constant dust / gas temperature difference , @xmath15 .",
    "the simulations started with a map of beam - averaged column densities ( i.e. , column densities that are averaged over @xmath16 scales ) and component-1 dust temperatures .",
    "model parameters were specified for two subsamples and two components ( see table  [ tbl-7 ] for details ) .",
    "the two subsamples were the @xmath18k points and the @xmath19k points .",
    "this is not exactly the same as using @xmath20k ( where @xmath6 is the 140@xmath3/@xmath21 color temperature ) as the boundary ( as was done in paper  i ) , but , since @xmath22k and since the column density of component 1 within each velocity interval , i.e. @xmath23 , is factors of 4 to 10 larger than the corresponding component-0 quantity , @xmath24 ( see table  [ tbl-7 ] ) , component  1 dominates the emission near the @xmath25k boundary by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "consequently , @xmath20k is equivalent to @xmath25k for all practical purposes .",
    "the model intensity maps were then generated using the procedure below :    1 .",
    "the map of @xmath17 values determined whether a given pixel belonged to subsample@xmath21 or subsample@xmath22 .",
    "2 .   the subsample to which a pixel belongs then dictated which model parameter values belonged to that pixel . using these values in equation  ( 28 ) of paper  i gave the area filling factor within a clump velocity width , or the @xmath26 value , for that pixel .",
    "the observed velocity width , @xmath27 , adopted was 2@xmath28 , which is the the actual observed velocity width in the orion clouds in the @xmath0 line on the scale of @xmath29 .",
    "nevertheless , the expressions that give the observed intensities ( i.e. , 27 and 29 of paper  i ) are actually independent of @xmath27 . @xmath27 only determines the filling factor , @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   equations ( 20 ) , ( 27 ) , ( 31 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 29 ) of paper  i then gave the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 intensities observable from that pixel .",
    "in addition , the color corrections for bands 9 and 10 of _ cobe_/_dirbe _ converted the @xmath30 and @xmath31 values to those observable in the _ dirbe _ bands .",
    "the intensities , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , then specified the uncertainties in those intensities , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , based on the prescriptions described below and based on the observed data .",
    "these uncertainties for all the pixels represent the @xmath36 maps .",
    "5 .   for the given pixel , a random number generator with a normally distributed probability of outputs with a mean of zero and",
    "an rms dispersion of unity generated noise values in the three wavelength bands .",
    "the noise value for each band was scaled by the @xmath36 for that pixel and for that band ( i.e. @xmath33 , @xmath34 , or @xmath35 ) .",
    "these noise values for all the pixels represent the noise maps .",
    "the noise maps were then added to the noise - free intensity maps to produce the final simulated maps .",
    "the noise prescriptions mentioned above are based on the @xmath37 smoothed maps of the real observations .",
    "the uncertainties in these maps had approximately the following behavior : @xmath38 it should be mentioned that the sigma levels for the simulated 240@xmath3 and @xmath39 maps are actually half of those of the actual observed maps .",
    "this reduction of the sigma levels in the simulated 240@xmath3 and @xmath39 maps was done to ensure a sufficient number of high - sigma points . to generate the @xmath36 map for @xmath32 , a portion of the map area that would represent the lower - noise subfield within orion@xmath2a field was chosen .",
    "the simulated maps were chosen to be 51@xmath2pixels  @xmath40  51@xmath2pixels , a total of 2601 pixels and similar to that of the orion fields : 2609 .",
    "the area designated to have the lower noise of the orion@xmath2a field consisted of two separate rectangular patches with a total of 156 pixels .",
    "one of the patches included a peak in the input column density map and the other patch included areas of low column density ( see figure  [ fig36 ] ) .",
    "the patch with the column density peak also had a peak in the component-1 dust temperature .",
    "this was consistent with the actual observations .",
    "now the input column density and component-1 dust temperature maps must be specified .",
    "these maps are depicted in figure  [ fig36 ] .",
    "the maximum column density was chosen to be roughly the same as that of the observations ( i.e. , the two - component models ) : @xmath41 .",
    "the column density map has two elliptical gaussians : one with a low peak that crudely represents the orion@xmath2nebula field and one with a high peak that crudely represents the main body of the orion@xmath2a molecular cloud . in the orion@xmath2nebula field",
    ", the dust temperature rises with rising column density .",
    "consequently , the component-1 dust temperature map has an elliptical gaussian peak corresponding to the low peak in the column density map . in the main body of the orion@xmath2a cloud",
    ", however , the dust temperature declines with increasing column density .",
    "therefore , the temperature map has an elliptical gaussian _ valley _ corresponding to the high peak in the column density map .",
    "the component-1 temperatures range from 3 to 28@xmath2k . to ensure that a small minority of the pixels had sufficiently low temperature values",
    ", these values were placed in two patches on the left edge of the map ( see lower panel of figure  [ fig36 ] ) .",
    "the procedure above was then implemented using the parameter values in the first two columns of table  [ tbl-7 ] to yield the simulated maps .",
    "figures  [ fig37 ] to [ fig40 ] show the results of the simulations along with some comparisons with the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig37 ] shows the distribution of pixel intensities for the 140- and 240-@xmath42 continuum maps and for the @xmath0 line map for both the simulations and observations .",
    "the pixels represented in the histograms are only those where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are simultaneously greater than 5-@xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to 1465 pixels for the simulations and 674 pixels for the observations . even after normalizing for the factor of @xmath432 greater number of high signal - to - noise pixels in the simulations , the number of medium- and high - intensity pixels",
    "( i.e. @xmath44 for @xmath30 and @xmath45 for @xmath31 ) in the 140- and 240-@xmath42 simulated maps is about 2 to 3 times higher than for the maps of the real observations .",
    "for the @xmath32 map , the simulations have about a factor of 5 higher number of pixels of medium- and high - intensity ( i.e. @xmath46 ) than in the observations .",
    "all the simulated maps have a higher ratio of medium- and high - intensity pixels to low - intensity pixels than the observations .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath0 maps .",
    "this is partly because the simulations have roughly twice the fraction of low @xmath5 values than do the observations ( i.e. for @xmath47 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the normalized pixel distributions of the simulations agree with those of the observations to within factors of a few .",
    "exact agreement is not necessary in any case , because the purpose of the simulations is to check how well the original input parameters are recovered , whether those parameters adequately mimic the real observations or not .",
    "another check of this mimicry is given in figure  [ fig38 ] .",
    "these are the plots of @xmath5 versus @xmath6 upon which all of the modeling in the current work is based .",
    "the simulations adequately reproduce the main features of the observations : the triangular cluster of points for @xmath48k and the monotonic rise for @xmath49k . however , the simulations do _ not _ account for the observed points that fill in the center of the triangular cluster and also do _ not _ account for the points of @xmath50 .",
    "this comparison between simulations and observations suggests that the basic assumption ( see paper  i ) is not correct and that we need appropriately chosen subsamples , each with its own set of physical conditions , to account for the shortcomings in the simulations ( see the end of section  3.4 of paper  i ) .",
    "nevertheless , the simulated @xmath5 versus @xmath6 plot is an adequate representation of the observations .",
    "in fact , the noise in the simulations seems to account for the low-@xmath5 points ( i.e. the points with @xmath51 to 22@xmath2k and @xmath52 ) mentioned in section  3.1 of paper  i.    figure  [ fig39 ] further compares the simulations with the observations , and has plots of the one - component , continuum - derived gas column densities , @xmath53 , versus the dust temperature , @xmath13 , in the one - component case .",
    "since these are continuum - derived quantities , they are independent of the particular parameter values of the one - component model ( e.g. , gas density , gas column density per velocity interval , etc . ) .",
    "again , the simulations adequately imitate the observations .",
    "there are only slight differences .",
    "for example , the simulations show a hook - like feature centered at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , which is nearly , but not completely , absent from the observations .",
    "another example is a spur that extends from @xmath56 to 18 for @xmath57 in the simulations that is only hinted at in the observations .",
    "notice also that the simulations have a smaller vertical spread in the @xmath58k points than do the observations . still , these are just minor discrepancies .",
    "like figure  [ fig39 ] , figure  [ fig40 ] plots the continuum - derived gas column densities against the dust temperature ( the component-1 temperature for this figure ) , but this time for the two - component , two - subsample models . for the two - component cases ,",
    "the specific parameter values _ do _ indeed matter .",
    "specifically , the resultant parameter values from the model fits to the actual observations are those given in table  2 of paper  i. the resultant parameter values from model fits to the simulations are given in table  [ tbl-7 ] ( the model results from the data with noise ) .",
    "again , the simulations satisfactorily represent the observations and have only minor discrepancies .",
    "the most noticeable of these is the group of points with large error bars at @xmath59 to 8 for @xmath60 to 500 that occur for the real observations and are not in the simulations .    given that the simulations are reasonable , we now examine how well the models recover the inputs .",
    "we start with the most realistic models  the two - component , two - subsample , lvg models  and move towards the simplistic models  the one - component models  to see what information they can realistically recover .",
    "the best fitting model curves to the simulations for the two - component , two - subsample models are shown in figure  [ fig41 ] and the corresponding parameter values are given in the last four columns of table  [ tbl-7 ] .",
    "columns  4 and 5 of table  [ tbl-7 ] list the model results from fitting the models to the data before the noise was added  i.e. , the noise - free data .",
    "columns  6 and 7 list those results for the fits to the data that have noise added .",
    "the results in these columns can be compared with the simulation inputs in columns  2 and 3 .",
    "( column  1 gives the parameter names . )",
    "the two subsamples were chosen from those pixels for which the signal - to - noise ratio was @xmath61 in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 simultaneously .",
    "of course , the signal - to - noise ratio is not defined for the noise - free maps ; so the pixels that matched the signal - to - noise criteria in the maps with the added noise were also the pixels chosen in the corresponding noise - free maps .",
    "also , fitting the model required specifying the error bars , even for the noise - free maps .",
    "the error bars were specified to be the same as those in the corresponding maps with added noise , even though the noise - free maps had no noise and , therefore , no errors .",
    "a number of important conclusions result from comparing the results with the inputs .",
    "the most important is that * completely * _ recovering the inputs * even * in the noise - free case is * not * possible .",
    "_ this despite the model curves fitting the data extremely well ( see figure  [ fig41 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , problems like not recovering the correct values of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , or @xmath64 within an order of magnitude or more are _ intrinsic shortcomings _ of the method itself and are _ not _ entirely due to the uncertainties caused by noise in the data . also note that some results are _ more _ accurate in the noise-_added _ data than in the noise - free data .",
    "for example , @xmath62 for both the @xmath65k and @xmath66k subsamples was more accurately recovered in the model fits to the data with noise than in fits to the noise - free data .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath24 for the @xmath65k subsample .",
    "better recovery from fits to the data with noise is probably just random luck .",
    "as discussed in section  3.3 of paper  i , the fitting process itself has random elements , such as the choice of starting grid .",
    "this choice affects the final results of some parameters .",
    "consequently , a different choice of starting grid could easily result in worse recovery than better .",
    "comparing the particular model results found here with the inputs gives a crude measure of the accuracy of the modeling .",
    "the results of this comparison are summarized below :    * @xmath1 is within 1@xmath2k for the @xmath65k subsample and within 2@xmath2k for the @xmath66k subsample ( within 1@xmath2k in the noise - free case ) . *",
    "@xmath67 for the @xmath65k subsample is known within the formal uncertainty of @xmath68k .",
    "( for the actual observations this would be an order of magnitude larger . ) for the @xmath66k subsample , the value for @xmath67 is adopted .",
    "* @xmath62 is known within a factor of 2 for the @xmath65k subsample ( within a factor of 16 for the noise - free case ) .",
    "it is known within a factor of 3 for the @xmath66k subsample ( within a factor of 2 for the noise - free case ) .",
    "* @xmath24 is known within a factor of 3 for both subsamples ( within a factor of 10 for the noise - free case for the @xmath65k subsample and within a factor of 2 for the noise - free case for the @xmath66k subsample ) . *",
    "again , the product @xmath69 is more accurately recovered than either of its factors .",
    "this is known to within a factor of 2 for both subsamples ( also within a factor of 2 or exactly correct in the noise - free case depending on the subsample ) .",
    "* @xmath63 is out by 3 orders of magnitude or exactly correct depending on the subsample ( with the same behavior in the noise - free case ) .",
    "* @xmath23 is within a factor of 2 for both subsamples ( within a factor of 2 or exactly correct in the noise - free case depending on the subsample ) .",
    "* @xmath64 is within a factor of 6 for the @xmath65k subsample and within a factor of 2 for the @xmath66k subsample ( within a factor of 6 or exactly correct in the noise - free case depending on the subsample ) .",
    "we discuss these accuracies in more detail after examining the results of simple two - component models applied to the simulated data in the next subsection .",
    "one important point is the reliability of the @xmath1 result .",
    "given that the two - component model results _ always _ yield a @xmath1 value that is within 1@xmath2k , or sometimes 2@xmath2k , of zero , is it _",
    "possible _ that the two - component models _ always _ yield this result , _ regardless of the true value of @xmath1 ?",
    "_ this was tested by modeling simulated maps with inputs @xmath70k for the @xmath65k subsample and @xmath71 for the @xmath66k subsample . _",
    "the two - component , two - subsample model results were again within 1@xmath2k of the input @xmath1 values .",
    "_ therefore , @xmath1 is very likely zero for the observations as well .",
    "the best fitting model curves can find the component-1 dust temperatures and the column densities as a function of position .",
    "these are compared with the original input values .",
    "figure  [ fig42 ] shows the recovered @xmath17 values plotted against the input @xmath17 values . despite the noise in the simulated maps ,",
    "the recovered @xmath17 values match the input values to within a few percent for the majority of ( high signal - to - noise ) points .",
    "the most noticeable exceptions occur in two spurs that extend above and below the solid line plotted in the lower panel of that figure .",
    "the upper spur represents those positions where @xmath17 is between about 3 and 8@xmath2k , but has been misidentified as being between 16 and 9@xmath2k .",
    "the lower spur represents another misidentification of @xmath17 , but in the opposite sense : @xmath17 is really between 17 and 20@xmath2k , but has been assigned to be between 4 and 3@xmath2k .",
    "this mistake in assigning the correct @xmath17 value for some positions is easy to understand . in figure",
    "[ fig41 ] , the model curve for the @xmath72k sample crosses itself ; there is a vertical segment that crosses an inclined segment . at the intersection point",
    ", the vertical segment has @xmath73-@xmath74k and the inclined segment has @xmath75k .",
    "therefore , any points in the @xmath5 versus @xmath6 plot near this intersection point are easily misassigned to the vertical segment , when it really belongs to the inclined segment , and vice versa .",
    "as the noise in the data grows larger , more points will be assigned to the wrong segment . in this case , the number of misassigned points is only 8% of the total number of high signal - to - noise points .",
    "the misassignment of @xmath17 values changes the determination of column densities .",
    "this is illustrated in the panels of figure  [ fig43 ] , which are plots of the model - derived column densities ( i.e. , continuum - derived gas column densities and @xmath39 line - derived gas column densities ) versus the input column densities .",
    "as in the previous figure , the majority of positions show nearly perfect agreement ( within a few percent ) between the model - derived column densities and the input column densities .",
    "however , again as in the previous figure , there are two spurs representing strong disagreements . in this figure",
    "the disagreements are factors of @xmath434 - 6 in either direction . obviously , the spurs in the column density plots of figure  [ fig43 ] correspond to the spurs in the dust temperature plots of figure  [ fig42 ] , although in the opposite sense : the upper spur in the dust temperature plots corresponds to the lower spur in the column density plots and vice versa .",
    "the question is why the disagreements are around a factor of 5 . starting with equation  ( 40 ) of paper  i",
    ", we first consider the case where the @xmath17 of a position is 18@xmath2k , which is numerically equal to @xmath67 , and has been misassigned to 4@xmath2k .",
    "if the @xmath17 value had been correct , then the correct column density _ would _ have been given by @xmath76 which was obtained by setting @xmath77 .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath78 and ( [ mr46 ] ) simplifies to @xmath79 but , because this data point has @xmath17 misassigned to some low value , we have @xmath80_{\\hbox{$_{mod}$ } } +   c_0 \\left[{\\rm { n_{c0}({\\rm { } ^{13}{\\kern-.0800em}co})\\over{\\rm\\delta v_c}}}\\right]_{\\hbox{$_{mod}$}}\\over   c_0\\left[{\\rm { n_{c0}({\\rm { } ^{13}{\\kern-.0800em}co})\\over{\\rm\\delta v_c}}}\\right]_{\\hbox{$_{mod}$}}}\\ \\ , { f_{\\nu_{10}}({\\rm t_{dc}})\\over f_{\\nu_{10}}({\\rm t_{d0}})}\\ \\,{\\rm n_{d1}(h)}\\qquad , \\label{mr48}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 was assumed .",
    "this assumption is especially valid in the wien limit , which applies to the 240@xmath3 continuum for these temperatures .",
    "because the wien limit applies , we can also state that @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 . using this and dividing ( [ mr48 ] ) by ( [ mr47 ] ) yields @xmath84_{\\hbox{$_{mod}$ } }",
    "+   c_0 \\left[{\\rm { n_{c0}({\\rm { } ^{13}{\\kern-.0800em}co})\\over{\\rm\\delta v_c}}}\\right]_{\\hbox{$_{mod}$}}\\over   c_0\\left[{\\rm { n_{c0}({\\rm { } ^{13}{\\kern-.0800em}co})\\over{\\rm\\delta v_c}}}\\right]_{\\hbox{$_{mod}$}}}\\qquad .",
    "\\label{mr49}\\ ] ] using the parameter values in table  [ tbl-7 ] for the @xmath65k subsample for the data with noise gives @xmath85 as desired .",
    "for the real observed data , the model parameter values in table  2 again give @xmath85 .",
    "note that in the opposite case where the @xmath86k data point is misassigned to @xmath87k , the right side of expression  ( [ mr49 ] ) is changed to its reciprocal or , numerically , 0.2 . even though there are two spurs , there are many more points in the upper spur than in the lower spur ; this results in overestimate of the total mass of about 7% .",
    "the above only explains the spur locations in the continuum - derived column density plots of figure  [ fig43 ] ( i.e. , the upper panels ) .",
    "the explanation for the @xmath39-derived column densities is similar . instead of starting with expression  ( 40 ) of paper",
    "i as was done for the continuum - derived column densities , we would start with ( 34 ) of paper  i. since @xmath88 for a large area of parameter space ( see section  3.3 of paper  i ) , the arguments used above apply to the @xmath39-derived column densities as well .",
    "the only difference is that , now , the wien limit does not apply and we may not be able to approximate the @xmath89@xmath90 in the denominator with @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , such an approximation is _ still _ valid , because these radiation temperatures are with respect to the cosmic background temperature of roughly 3@xmath2k .",
    "so , for the example discussed here , where @xmath87k is mistaken for @xmath86k , @xmath92 is not @xmath93 , but closer to @xmath94 , more than 3 times smaller . consequently , equation  ( [ mr49 ] ) and its reciprocal are still valid for the @xmath39-derived column densities .",
    "the overestimate of the total mass from using the @xmath39 data is similar to that for the continuum - derived total mass : 6% .",
    "figure  [ fig44 ] shows that the two types of model - derived column densities agree with each other extremely well , _ despite _ having 7% of these wrong by factors of 5 .",
    "the total masses also agree well because the erroneous column densities are wrong by the same factors for both the continuum - derived and @xmath39-derived column densities .    in summary ,",
    "the simulations show that even modeling the noise - free data will not allow perfect recovery of the parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations show that we obtain @xmath1 to within 1 or 2@xmath2k ( even when that @xmath1 is different from zero ) , @xmath67 to better than a millikelvin for the @xmath72k subsample , the component-0 density can be off by 3 orders of magnitude , and the other parameters might be known to within about an order of magnitude .",
    "recovery of other quantities like the component-1 dust temperatures and the gas column densities is apparently accurate to within a few percent for 93% of the points .",
    "the other 7% of the points have column densities too high or too low by a factor of about 5 .",
    "this results in overestimate of 6 - 7% in the total mass .",
    "the best fitting model curve for the two - component models applied to the whole sample of high signal - to - noise points in the simulations is shown in figure  [ fig45 ] .",
    "again , these points corresponded to those pixels for which the signal - to - noise ratio was @xmath61 in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 simultaneously .",
    "as done in section  3.3 and figure  21 of paper  i , figure  [ fig46 ] shows the systematic effects on the resultant parameters when a scale factor applied to the data is changed . comparing the various panels of figure  [ fig46 ] with the corresponding panels of figure  21 of paper  i reveals strong similarities between the models applied to the simulations and those applied to the observed data .",
    "the range of parameter variations is nearly identical in the two cases .",
    "however , there is one important difference between the systematic effects on the simulated data model results and those of the observed : with the simulated data we can specify the accuracy of the recovered results by comparing the  true \" values ( i.e. , the inputs ) with the model results ; with the actual observed data we can only estimate such accuracy by comparing the results in different cases ( i.e. , with different scale factors applied to the data or with different starting grids ) with each other .",
    "the accuracy of the recovered results for the simulations can also be tested by comparing the results in different cases  as was done in figure  [ fig46 ] . by comparing this accuracy with the accuracy obtained from comparisons with the input values",
    ", we now have insights into the estimated accuracies of the actual observations .",
    "an example of such comparisons is inspecting how @xmath1 varies in figure  [ fig46 ] about the @xmath1 value for a scale factor of unity ( i.e. sf=1.0 ) and then comparing this with how those @xmath1 values vary about the original input value .",
    "this then tells us whether the variation of @xmath1 with the scale factor for the real observations ( see figure  21 of paper  i ) is a realistic measure of the uncertainty in @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fig46 ] , @xmath1 varies within 2@xmath2k of the value , i.e. @xmath95k , for sf=1.0 .",
    "the input value was @xmath95k .",
    "therefore , the variation of @xmath1 with the scale factor provides a reasonable estimate of the actual uncertainty in @xmath1 . for the models applied to the observations , figure  21 of paper",
    "i shows us that @xmath1 varies within 1@xmath2k of the value corresponding to sf=1.0 , i.e. @xmath95k .",
    "so we can say that the model @xmath1 value is within 1 or 2@xmath2k of the true @xmath1 value . using the same arguments applied to @xmath67",
    "suggests that this is known to within a 1@xmath2mk or less ; this is undoubtedly optimistic and is dependent on the basic assumption .",
    "( it is also dependent on other assumptions , such as whether the spectral emissivity index , @xmath12 , really is 2.0 or something nearby .",
    "paper  iii suggests that @xmath67 can be anywhere from @xmath4316 to @xmath4319@xmath2k . ) for the other parameters , which had different input values for the two subsamples , we will compare the model results with the geometric mean of the two inputs :    * the parameter @xmath62 can be off by a factor of 10 from the value corresponding to sf=1.0 ( for both the simulations and the observations ) , but is off by a factor of 40 from the input .",
    "in addition , the model - derived @xmath62 values for all the scale factors are systematically lower than the input . in other words",
    ", we can not rely on varying the scale factor to give us parameter values that will surround the true value .",
    "again , @xmath62 is much more reliable when combined with @xmath24 . *",
    "@xmath24 itself can be out by a factor of 100 from the value corresponding to sf=1.0 ( for both simulations and observations ) , _ and _ is _ also _",
    "wrong by this factor compared to the input .",
    "* the product @xmath69 is off by at most only a factor of 10 compared to the value corresponding to sf=1.0 , _ and _ is _ also _",
    "wrong by this factor compared to the input .",
    "also , unlike @xmath62 alone , the range of different values of @xmath69 corresponding to different scale factors does indeed include the input value .",
    "* @xmath63 is as much as a factor of 100 away from the value for sf=1.0 for the simulations , and as much as factor 1000 away for the observations .",
    "the different @xmath63 values for the simulations can be wrong by as much as a factor of 200 from the input , and the range of these values includes the input value .",
    "it would seem , then , that the observations would suggest a greater uncertainty in @xmath63 than would the simulations .",
    "* @xmath23 is as much as a factor of 10 from the value at sf=1.0 for both the simulations and observations .",
    "@xmath23 can be as far as a factor of 30 from the input , which is worse than the comparison with the @xmath23 value at sf=1.0 would suggest .",
    "the range of possible @xmath23 values for the different scale factors ( see figure  [ fig46 ] ) includes the input value .",
    "* @xmath64 can be as far as a factors of 2 or 3 from the value at sf=1.0 for both the simulations and observations .",
    "however , @xmath64 can be out by a factor of 20 from the input value , much worse than comparison with the value at sf=1.0 implies . also , another problem is that the range of possible @xmath64 values ( see figure  [ fig46 ] ) does _ not _ include the input : the model - derived densities are all systematically too low by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the most interesting conclusion is that some parameters like @xmath62 and @xmath64 have a range of values that does _ not _ include the true input value .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xmath62 is assessed more reliably as part of the @xmath69 product , whose range of values does indeed include the input value .",
    "@xmath64 still has this disadvantage , which can not be `` fixed '' as easily as for @xmath62 .",
    "based on the comparisons of the different results , the ranges of likely values of the different parameters have been listed in table  [ tbl-8 ] .",
    "the range of values for each parameter assumes the minimum and maximum values as in the case of the simple , and the two - subsample , two - component models  with some important exceptions . in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the maximum value found was @xmath96k , but the simulations suggest that @xmath97k is also possible .",
    "therefore , @xmath97k is listed .",
    "note also that even though , for simplicity , a one - component model was applied to the @xmath66k subsample , the two - component model results for that subsample represent the likely ranges listed in table  [ tbl-8 ] . for @xmath62 and @xmath24 , only the range of their product was listed , in order to provide more realistic constraints on these parameters . for the column density per velocity interval in general ,",
    "it was stated in section  3.2 of paper  i that the lower limit had to be about @xmath98 as roughly constrained by the large - scale properties of the cloud .",
    "for the two - component models , this lower limit would apply to @xmath99@xmath100 .",
    "however , @xmath101 is larger than @xmath100 by factors of 3 to 4",
    ". therefore , the first term in that expression dominates and it is sufficient to apply that lower limit to @xmath101 only , as was done in table  [ tbl-8 ] . as for the densities , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , putting upper limits on those",
    "is not possible , because the results are not distinguishable from those of lte .",
    "consequently , only lower limits are used .",
    "also the lower limit of @xmath64 has been increased by an order of magnitude , because , as stated in the previous paragraph , all the values of @xmath64 found by the simple two - component models are too low by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the best fitting model curves shown in figure  [ fig45 ] were used to find the component-1 dust temperatures and the column densities as a function of position .",
    "these are compared with the original input values .",
    "figure  [ fig47 ] shows the recovered @xmath17 values plotted against the input @xmath17 values .",
    "again , as in figure  [ fig42 ] , the majority of recover @xmath17 values match the input values reasonably well , except for the two spurs .",
    "the noticeable difference , however , is the systematic overestimate of @xmath17 for input @xmath17 values @xmath102k and a systematic underestimate of most of the @xmath17 values above this limit .",
    "these systematic effects are obviously the result of forcing a single curve to fit the two different subsamples : the curve systematically underestimates a large fraction of the @xmath72k subsample and overestimates most of the @xmath66k subsample .",
    "this results in systematically underestimating ( overestimating ) the @xmath17 values for the simulated data points in the @xmath18k ( @xmath66k ) subsample .",
    "the incorrect estimates of the @xmath17 values change the determination of the column densities .",
    "this is obvious in the panels of figure  [ fig48 ] , which are plots of the model - derived column densities versus the input column densities , analogous to those in figure  [ fig43 ] for the two - component , two - subsample models . as in figure",
    "[ fig43 ] , there are two spurs of very large disagreements ( i.e. , factors of @xmath103 in both directions ) .",
    "but , unlike that figure , figure  [ fig48 ] shows systematic disagreements of about 10% and 20% on either side of the solid line  the line that represents perfect agreement .",
    "again those disagreements follow naturally from the disagreements seen in the plot of @xmath17 values in figure  [ fig47 ] : the points that have overestimated @xmath17 values in the @xmath72k subsample will have underestimated column densities and vice versa for many of the points in the @xmath66k . despite these noticeable disagreements , the continuum - derived and @xmath39-derived column densities in figure  [ fig49 ]",
    "agree well , although with noticeably larger scatter than in figure  [ fig44 ] for the two - component , two - subsample models . also , the total mass estimated from the model results is only overestimated by about 3 to 6% .    in summary , the results of the simple two - component models applied to the simulations for different scale factors has allowed reasonable estimates of the ranges of parameter values for all the two - component models .",
    "these ranges allow for systematic uncertainties in the real observations and are listed in table  [ tbl-8 ] .",
    "there are noticeable systematic errors in the derived component-1 dust temperatures and in the derived column densities . despite these systematic errors ,",
    "the simple two - component models still give reasonable estimates of the total mass of the orion clouds .",
    "the best fitting model curve for the one - component models applied to the high signal - to - noise points in the simulations is depicted in figure  [ fig50 ] .",
    "as discussed in section  3.2 of paper  i and illustrated in figure  16 of paper  i , figure  [ fig51 ] of the current paper shows the systematic effects on the resultant parameters when a scale factor applied to the data is changed . comparing the three panels of figure  [ fig51 ] with the corresponding panels of figure  16 of paper",
    "i reveals that the models of the simulations and those of the observed data are similar .",
    "the range of variation of the parameters is nearly identical in the two cases , except in the panels of the @xmath1 values : in that panel the model results of the simulations have systematically lower @xmath1 values than those of the observations by 1 to 5@xmath2k , the larger difference applying to the @xmath104k subsample . for this subsample ,",
    "the observed data points have lower @xmath5 values on average than do the simulated data points .    also , the one - component modeling of the observed data was done a little differently from that of the simulated data .",
    "the observed data were modeled with the one - component models applied to the whole sample of points and then again for just the @xmath104k points .",
    "in contrast , the simulated data were modeled with the one - component models applied to _ just _ the @xmath105k points and then _ just _ the @xmath104k points . in short ,",
    "the @xmath106k subsample was _ not _ treated separately for the observed data points , but was indeed treated separately for the simulated data points .",
    "this different treatment is because the @xmath104k subsample only represents 12% of the high signal - to - noise points in the observed data , but represents 28% of those points in the simulated data .",
    "therefore , modeling the entire sample of observed data points yields results that are nearly identical to modeling only the @xmath106k subsample , because these points are the majority of data points .",
    "for the simulated data , this is not entirely the case , because the @xmath104k subsample is not such a negligible fraction of the complete sample ; therefore completely separating the two subsamples was more important for the simulated data than for the observed data .",
    "now the model results are compared with the inputs .",
    "the model - derived @xmath1 values are all systematically lower than the input @xmath1 values . for the @xmath107 and n(h@xmath108 ) parameters",
    ", we must find the corresponding parameters in the two - component , two - subsample models ( because these were the models used to generate the simulated maps ) .",
    "the continuum emission of the majority of points in the @xmath105k subsample are dominated by the emission of component  0 and the continuum emission of all of the points in the @xmath104k subsample are dominated by the emission of component  1 .",
    "_ however , _ since the parameters we are discussing are largely physical parameters of the molecular gas , the @xmath0 line emission is a better guide in determining which component is the more relevant .",
    "the @xmath0 line emission of component  1 dominates that of component  0 for _ all _ the points , except for the small minority of points where the component  1 temperature is less than about 4@xmath2k .",
    "therefore , the @xmath107 and n(h@xmath108 ) values of the one - component models are identified with the @xmath23 and @xmath64 values of the two - component models for both subsamples .",
    "the resultant @xmath107 values compare very favorably with the known input values : the range of @xmath107 values includes the input values of @xmath23 for the @xmath105k and the @xmath104k subsamples .",
    "also four of the five @xmath107 values for the different sf values are within a factor of 2 of the input value for the @xmath104k subsample .",
    "the densities determined from the one - component models cover ranges that include the input values . at sf=1.0 ,",
    "the model density is within a factor of 2 of the input @xmath64 value of the @xmath104k subsample . even though the one - component model curves do not characterize the data well , it is ironic that some parameter values , like the column density per velocity interval and the volume density , are obtained more accurately with the one - component , two - subsample models than with the simple two - component models .",
    "it is clear then that , for some parameters , there is a greater advantage in having two subsamples than there is in having two components .",
    "this may be an effect of using the continuum emission , because the two subsamples _ almost _ correspond to the two separate components when we consider just the continuum emission .    the best fitting model curves in figure  [ fig50 ]",
    "were used to find the dust temperatures and the column densities as a function of position .",
    "figure  [ fig52 ] shows the recovered @xmath13 values plotted against the input @xmath17 values .",
    "as expected , the model @xmath13 values do not reproduce all the input @xmath17 values , except for high @xmath17 . above @xmath109k ,",
    "the model @xmath13 values are within about 1@xmath2k of the input @xmath17 values .",
    "below this temperature , the one - component @xmath13 values increase with _ de_creasing @xmath17 .",
    "this is because , as @xmath17 decreases , component  0 and its temperature increasingly dominate the emission . also visible",
    "are two areas of larger error bars and , consequently , of heightened noise ( i.e. more scatter ) , located at @xmath110k and at @xmath111 - 21@xmath2k .",
    "this is due to the relatively larger noise at these temperatures in all three simulated maps ( i.e. , the maps of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the incorrectly determined @xmath17 values adversely affect the determination of the column densities .",
    "this is obvious in the panels of figure  [ fig53 ] , analogous to the plots in the previous subsections . to explain these plots we consider three groups of points defined in terms of the plots that appear in figure  [ fig40 ] .",
    "the separate group of points that occur between @xmath112 and 7@xmath2k for all values of @xmath53 and for @xmath17 between about 7 and 17@xmath2k for @xmath113 will be called  group  1 \" . the long descending ( as one moves left to right ) curve of points that starts at @xmath114 or 9@xmath2k ( for the simulations and observations , respectively ) with @xmath115 and runs down to @xmath116k with @xmath117 will be called  group  2 \" . the final ascending curve of points beyond @xmath118k is  group  3 \" . in the panels of figure  [ fig53 ] ,",
    "group  1 is the lower spur of points that runs from about ( 0,0 ) to about ( 100,20 ) .",
    "this spur corresponds to the lower spur in the column density plots of figures  [ fig43 ] and [ fig48 ] ; as explained previously , the strong underestimates of the column densities represented by this spur is due to the strong overestimates of the dust temperatures : component-0 emission overwhelmingly dominates over component-1 emission when this latter component is so cold . assuming a single component in the modeling",
    "will then result in a dust temperature that is the component-0 dust temperature .",
    "for the @xmath39-derived column densities , group  3 is the group of points that runs along the slope=1 line .",
    "the nearly perfect agreement here is because the dust temperatures for this group are correct to within a fraction of a kelvin .",
    "group  2 is the long curve that runs from the origin to the upper right of the plot in the panels for the @xmath39-derived column densities .",
    "as one ascends this curve ( moving from left to right ) , the column density estimates move increasingly further from the correct ( i.e. , input ) column densities . in figure",
    "[ fig52 ] , group  2 is the flattened v - shaped curve of points that extends from @xmath119k to 20@xmath2k .",
    "as one moves to lower @xmath17 , the model @xmath13 moves further from the input @xmath17 . and ,",
    "as one moves to lower @xmath17 in figure  [ fig52 ] , one is moving to higher @xmath120 in figure  [ fig53 ] .",
    "consequently , the model @xmath13 moving further from the input @xmath17 is the reason that the model @xmath120 moves further from the input n(h ) .",
    "another noticeable characteristic of the curve ( of the points in group  2 ) in the lower panels of figure  [ fig53 ] is that its slope increasingly deviates from unity when moving left to right and then , for input @xmath121 , the slope curves back in the direction of slope=1 .",
    "this is simply a reflection of the flattened v - shaped curve in figure  [ fig52 ] when moving right to left .",
    "the upper panels of figure  [ fig53 ] , which have the continuum - derived column densities , show more extreme deviations of the one - component - model column densities from the input column densities .",
    "these panels also show qualitatively similar , but more extreme , slope variations in the group  2 points than in the lower panels .",
    "this is because these continuum observations , at wavelengths close to the wien limit , are much more sensitive to errors in the temperature estimates .",
    "note also that the group  2 and group  3 points are blended in the upper panels for @xmath122 because of the higher uncertainties of some of the 140@xmath3 observations compared with some of the @xmath39 observations . because of the greater sensitivity of the continuum observations to errors in temperature , the error in the estimated total gas mass is further from the correct value than that estimated from the @xmath39 observations : the simulated continuum observations underestimate the total mass by 48% and the simulated @xmath39 observations underestimate this mass by 40% .",
    "figure  [ fig54 ] has the plots of the @xmath39-derived column densities versus the continuum - derived column densities . in these plots ,",
    "the disagreement is no worse than a factor of 2 to within about 5% for the majority of points with @xmath123 .",
    "the overall shape of the points , roughly reminiscent of the loch - ness monster , roughly reflects the points in the upper panels of figure  [ fig53 ] about a solid line with slope=1 and intercept=0 .",
    "a better description is that the points in figure  [ fig54 ] represent a reflection of the points in the upper panels of figure  [ fig53 ] about the corresponding groups of points in the lower panels of that figure .",
    "the slopes represented in figure  [ fig54 ] , again for the points with @xmath123 , range between about 0.8 and about 2 .",
    "for the one - component models applied to the real data , the slopes range from about 0.6 and 1.7 ( see figure  10 of paper  i ) .    in summary , the one - component models can provide reasonable estimates of the column density per velocity interval and volume density ( i.e. , within factors of 2 or 3 ) provided that these models are applied to the two different subsamples ( i.e. with @xmath13 below and above 20@xmath2k ) ; these reasonable numerical estimates are possible despite the poor characterization of the @xmath5 versus @xmath13 data points by the one - component models .",
    "the estimates of @xmath1 , however , can be wrong by about 20@xmath2k .",
    "the one - component models result in mass estimates that are too low by about 40 - 50% ; the continuum - derived mass estimates being worse on average than the @xmath39-derived mass estimates due to the higher temperature sensitivity of the continuum observations .",
    "the reliability of recovering physical conditions in the dust and gas of molecular clouds using the far - ir continuum and the @xmath0 line was tested by using simulated data .",
    "these data were created using input beam - average column density and dust temperature maps that crudely represented the inferred physical conditions in the orion  a and b giant molecular clouds ( see paper  i * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "input physical parameters , with values similar to those recovered from modeling the actual observed data ( see paper  i ) , in combination with the column density and dust temperature maps gave us the simulated intensity maps in the 140@xmath3 continuum , 240@xmath3 continuum and @xmath0 spectral line .",
    "the simulated maps assumed two subsamples of positions within the clouds and two components .",
    "the two components were component 0 , with constant physical conditions within each subsample , and component 1 , with constant physical conditions within each subsample , except for spatially varying dust and gas temperatures .",
    "the two subsamples were defined by the component-1 dust temperature , @xmath17 : those positions with @xmath124k represent one subsample and the positions with @xmath125k represent the other subsample .",
    "the point of the current paper was to apply the models used in paper  i to the simulated maps to see how well those models recover the input values of the physical parameters .",
    "given that the simulated maps are based on the two - component , two - subsample models , fitting such models to the simulated data in the noise - free case _",
    "might _ be expected to recover the inputs perfectly . however , even in the noise - free case some input parameters could _ not _ be recovered .",
    "the component-0 and component-1 densities , for example , were an order of magnitude or more different from the inputs .",
    "the simulated maps with noise show us that we can obtain the dust - gas temperature difference , @xmath1 , to within 1 or 2@xmath2k _ regardless of the specific value of @xmath1 . _",
    "the component zero dust temperature is apparently recovered to within a fraction of a kelvin , but see paper  iii for further discussion of this .",
    "recovery of the component-1 dust temperatures and the gas column densities is accurate to within a few percent for 93% of the points .",
    "the other 7% of the points have column densities too high or too low by a factor of about 5 .",
    "this results in overestimate of only 6 - 7% in the total mass .      1 .",
    "there are noticeable systematic offsets in the derived component-1 dust temperatures and in the derived column densities from their inputs .",
    "these offsets come from forcing a single model curve to fit through the two different subsamples .",
    "2 .   about 7% of the column densities are wrong by factors of 5 , as is the case for the two - subsample , two - component models .",
    "inspite of these systematic errors , the simple two - component models overestimate the total mass of the clouds by only 3 to 6% .",
    "3 .   despite the varying the scale factors , the inferred component-1 densities are _ all _ systematically too low by an order of magnitude or more from the input density .    keeping these shortcomings in mind gives us reasonable estimates of the parameter value ranges for all the two - component models as applied to the real observations .",
    "these ranges are listed in table  [ tbl-8 ] .",
    "the range for the component-1 density is the kind of range roughly expected for lte emission of the @xmath0 line .",
    "the range for the component-1 column density per velocity interval is given , as stated earlier , by the large - scale cloud properties at the low end and by the necessity of optically thin @xmath0 emission at the high end .",
    "for component 0 , the lower limit is nearly that of the master search grid .",
    "( note that the @xmath100 product lower limit is indeed _ equal _ to that of the master search grid , but the @xmath126 _ itself _ is still slightly larger than that . )    fitting the one - component models to the simulated data shows that these models can provide reasonable estimates of the column density per velocity interval and volume density ( i.e. , within factors of 2 or 3 ) provided that these models are applied to the two different subsamples ( i.e. with @xmath13 below and above 20@xmath2k ) .",
