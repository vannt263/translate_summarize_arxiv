    "according to the braneworld hypothesis , our observable universe can be considered as a three - dimensional space sheet ( a @xmath2-brane ) embedded in a larger spacetime with @xmath3 dimensions ( the bulk ) @xcite .",
    "brane is a concept inherited from high energy physics and unification models .",
    "testing the existence of branes or extra dimensions is therefore becoming a fundamental challenge .",
    "such evidences are expected to be obtained through high energy collisions @xcite , but it has been also demonstrated that some detectable effects could also be observed at low energy @xcite . this is the topic of the present paper .    some authors have early underlined or suggested that the particles of the standard model could be able to escape out of our visible world @xcite .",
    "many effects can be considered and have been explored until now along this line of thought .",
    "for instance , in some approaches , particles are expected to leak into the bulk through a tunnel effect @xcite . other works also considered that fluctuations of our home - brane could yield small bubbles branes , which carry chargeless matter particles ( such as neutrons for instance ) into the bulk @xcite . in another context ,",
    "other approaches consider some coupling between certain particles of the standard model and some hidden or dark sectors @xcite .",
    "it is sometimes suspected that such hidden sectors could live in other branes .",
    "it is the case with the photon - hidden photon kinetic mixing @xcite .",
    "a @xmath4  field on a hidden brane can be coupled to the @xmath4  photon field of our brane through a one - loop process in a stringy context @xcite . in the mirror world",
    "approaches , the matter - mirror matter mixing is also considered ( with neutron and mirror neutron @xcite for instance ) though , in the best of our knowledge , a full derivation through a brane formalism is still lacking . actually , ultracold neutron ( ucn ) experiments related to the neutron disappearance are then fundamental since they could allow to quantify or to distinguish among the different predicted phenomenologies @xcite .    in previous works @xcite , two of the present authors ( sarrazin and petit ) have shown that for a bulk containing at least two parallel 3-branes hidden to each other , matter swapping between these two worlds should occur .",
    "the particle must be massive , can be electrically charged or not , but must be endowed with a magnetic moment .",
    "this swapping effect between two neighboring 3-branes is triggered by using suitable magnetic vector potentials .",
    "more important , this new effect @xmath0 different from those previously described in literature @xmath0 could be detected and controlled with present day technology which opens the door to a possible experimental confirmation of the braneworld hypothesis . for charged particles , the swapping is possible though a few more difficult to achieve @xcite . as a consequence , for a sake of simplicity and in order to be able to distinguish the swapping effect with other kind of predicted phenomena , we suggested the use of neutron for a prospective experiment .    in the present work we discuss the possibility that an astrophysical magnetic vector potential could lead to such a matter swapping .",
    "the basic argument is that the astrophysical vector potentials are considerably larger than any other counterpart generated in a laboratory",
    ". a possible consequence for free neutrons would be then high frequency and small amplitude oscillations of the matter swapping probability between the two branes .",
    "ultracold neutrons stored in a vessel would therefore have a non - zero probability @xmath1 to escape from our brane toward the hidden brane at each wall collision .",
    "such a process would be perceived as a neutron disappearance from the point of view of an observer located in our brane .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to assess an upper limit on @xmath1 based on already published data in literature .",
    "this upper limit is then used to constrain the parameters of the model .",
    "on the basis of this assessment , more sensitive experiments are suggested and described .    in section [ model ] , the model describing the low - energy dynamics of a neutron in a two - brane universe is recalled .",
    "the conditions leading to matter swapping between branes are given .",
    "we discuss the origin @xmath0 and the magnitude @xmath0 of the ambient magnetic vector potential , which is required to observe matter exchange between branes . the gravitational environment that can impede the swapping to occur ,",
    "is also discussed . in section [ sec3 ] , available data from literature",
    "are analyzed and used to constrain the parameters of the two - brane universe model .",
    "finally , in section [ further ] improvements of the experimental setup are suggested .",
    "a variable - collision - rate experiment is proposed .",
    "a long timescale experiment as well as a laser - induced matter swapping experiment are also discussed .",
    "in previous works @xcite , it was shown that in a universe containing two parallel braneworlds invisible to each other , the quantum dynamics of a spin@xmath5 fermion can be described by a two - brane pauli equation at low energies . for a neutron outside a nucleus , in electromagnetic and gravitational fields",
    ", the relevant equations can be written as @xcite : @xmath6 where the indices @xmath7 are purely conventional and simply allow to discriminate the two branes . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are usual pauli spinors corresponding to the wave functions in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 branes respectively , and where @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond to the magnetic vector potentials in the branes @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the same convention is applied to the magnetic fields @xmath16 and to the gravitational potentials @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the magnetic moment of the particle .",
    "each diagonal term of @xmath19 is simply the usual pauli hamiltonian for each brane .",
    "in addition to these usual terms , the two - brane hamiltonian comprises also a new term @xmath20 fully specific of a universe with two branes @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 implies that matter exchange between branes depends on the magnetic moment and on the difference between the local ( i.e. on a brane ) values of the magnetic vector potentials .",
    "@xmath20 leads to a phenomenology which shares some similarities with the mirror matter paradigm @xcite or other approaches involving some hidden or dark matter sectors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the present approach differs in several ways :    * in the mirror ( or hidden ) matter formalism , it is often considered by implication that only one four - dimensional manifold exists and that particles split into two families : the standard and the mirror sectors . by contrast , in the present model , particles are restricted to those of the standard model but they have access to two distinct @xmath2-branes ( i.e. two distinct four - dimensional manifolds ) . as a consequence ,",
    "in the mirror matter approach , matter and mirror matter particles undergo the same gravitational fields ( i.e. @xmath21 ) whereas in the present braneworld approach , matter is subjected to the gravitational fields of each brane ( i.e. @xmath22 ) that possess their own gravitational sources . *",
    "the coupling between the particles of each brane occurs in a specific way without recourse of the coupling considered in the mirror matter concept .",
    "the coupling term @xmath20 is specific to the braneworld approach @xcite .",
    "since its value can be changed by modifying the local value of the magnetic vector potential , it can be consequently controlled by artificial means .",
    "the effects related to @xmath20 @xcite can be then distinguished from those related to coupling from other models @xcite .",
    "however , instead of considering artificial ( i.e. generated in a laboratory ) vector potentials we are now focusing on the case of an ambient magnetic potential with an astrophysical origin ( section [ magvect ] ) .",
    "let @xmath23 be the difference of ambient magnetic potentials of each brane .",
    "assuming that @xmath24 , i.e. one can neglect the magnetic fields in the branes ( especially one assumes that @xmath25 ) , then by solving the pauli equation , it can be shown that the probability for a neutron initially localized in our brane to be found in the other brane is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) shows that the neutron in the potential @xmath29 undergoes rabi - like oscillations between the branes .",
    "note that the probability does not depend on the neutron spin state by contrast with the magnetic vector potential direction in space . as detailed in previous papers @xcite , the environmental interactions ( related to @xmath17 ) are usually strong enough to almost suppress these oscillations .",
    "this can be verified by considering eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) showing that @xmath30 decreases as @xmath31 increases relatively to @xmath32 .",
    "since no such oscillations have been observed so far , we can assume that the ratio @xmath33 is usually very small .",
    "as a consequence , the oscillations present a weak amplitude and a high angular frequency of the order @xmath34 .",
    "let us now consider a neutron gas in a vessel . in the general case ,",
    "it is in a superposition of two states : neutron in our brane vs. neutron in the other brane .",
    "a collision between the neutron and a wall of the vessel acts therefore as a measurement and the neutron collapses either in our brane with a probability @xmath35 or in the other invisible brane with a probability @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider that the neutron swapping rate @xmath36 into the other brane is related to the collision rate @xmath37 between the neutron and the vessel walls , i.e. @xmath38 with @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the average flight time of neutrons between two collisions on vessel walls .",
    "the probability @xmath1 is the average of @xmath30 according to the statistical distribution of the free flight times , i.e. @xmath41    equations ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ proba ] ) are valid provided a large number of oscillations occur during a given time interval .",
    "this must be verified for @xmath42 ( i.e. @xmath43 ) but also during the duration @xmath44 of a neutron collision on a wall ( i.e. @xmath45 ) .",
    "can be estimated as the time needed for a neutron to make a round trip along the penetration depth @xmath46 of the wall ( typically @xmath47 nm @xcite ) . with @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the ucn velocity , here @xmath50 m@xmath51s@xmath52 ) , one gets @xmath53 ns . ] as shown hereafter , the lowest considered energies @xmath54 are about @xmath55 ev , i.e. @xmath56 hz , while @xmath57 hz and the greatest values of @xmath37 are about @xmath58 hz . as a consequence , the eqs .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ proba ] ) are legitimate in the present context .",
    "let us now consider that a natural astrophysical magnetic vector potential @xmath59 may have on the neutron dynamics in the vessel .",
    "the magnitude of such a potential was recently discussed in literature since it allows to constrain the photon mass @xcite .",
    "of course , in the present work , we are not concerned by such exotic property of photon , which is assumed to be massless .",
    "@xmath60 corresponds typically to a sum of individual contributions coming from astrophysical objects ( star , planet , galaxy , ... ) that surround us . indeed ,",
    "each astrophysical object endowed with a magnetic moment @xmath61 induces a magnetic potential : @xmath62 from which the magnetic field @xmath63 produced by the object can be deduced .",
    "we get @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the typical distance from the astrophysical source . in the vicinity of earth for instance , and at large distances from sources , we note that @xmath66 is then almost constant ( i.e. @xmath67 ) and can not be canceled with magnetic shields @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the main expected contributions to @xmath59 can be easily deduced .",
    "for instance , the earth contribution to @xmath29 is about @xmath68 t@xmath51 m while it is only @xmath69 t@xmath70 m for the sun @xcite .",
    "now , if we consider the galactic magnetic field * * ( * * about @xmath71 * *  * * @xmath18 g @xcite * * ) * * relatively to the milky way core * * ( * * at * *  * * about @xmath72 * *  * * m * * ) * * one gets @xmath73  t@xmath51 m @xcite . note that in refs .",
    "@xcite a value of @xmath74 t@xmath51 m was derived for the coma galactic cluster .",
    "unfortunately , other authors ( see goldhaber and nieto in ref .",
    "@xcite for instance ) , underlined that substantial inhomogeneities can exist in the field distributions such that @xmath29 may strongly vary in different regions .",
    "as a consequence , there is a lack of knowledge concerning the magnitude of contributions from extragalactic scales @xcite .",
    "therefore the value given in @xcite can not be presently considered as reliable enough to be used here .",
    "in addition , eq .",
    "( [ coupling ] ) shows that it is the difference @xmath75 between the vector potentials of the two braneworlds that is relevant .",
    "since @xmath76 depends on unknown sources in the other brane , we can not assess its value .",
    "for all these reasons , we should consider @xmath77 as an unknown parameter of the model .",
    "nevertheless , we will admit that a value of @xmath78  t@xmath51 m is probably of the right order of magnitude @xcite .      in the present context , @xmath80 and",
    "only gravitational interactions are relevant .",
    "it is difficult to specify the value of @xmath81 . indeed , since the gravitational contribution of the hidden world ( @xmath82 ) is unknown , @xmath79 must be therefore an unknown parameter of the model .",
    "however , according to the estimations given in previous works @xcite , @xmath83 could be of the order of @xmath84 ev due to the milky way core gravitational potential acting on neutron .",
    "by contrast , the sun , the earth and the moon contribute for about @xmath85 ev , @xmath86 ev and @xmath87 mev . as a consequence",
    ", one can fairly suppose that the value of @xmath79 is included in a range from few mev up to few kev .",
    "at last , one notes that @xmath79 must be also time - dependent .",
    "let us consider the significant motion of earth around the sun .",
    "owing to the sun gravitational potential only , the energy of a neutron varies from @xmath88 ev to @xmath89 ev between the aphelion and the perihelion .",
    "this corresponds to an absolute shift of @xmath90 of about @xmath91 mev per day .",
    "of course , the full time - dependence of @xmath79 could also have other origins .",
    "for instance , the relative neutron motion with respect to the unknown matter distribution in the hidden brane . nevertheless , it seems unlikely that our own solar system is  close  enough to a similar mass distribution ( in the other brane ) to induce a time - dependence on a timescale of the order of one day or one year . in this context",
    ", the most likely time - dependence will be induced by the earth motion around the sun , such that @xmath92 ev on one year . from eq .",
    "( [ proba ] ) , one can then expect a relative variation of the measured probability @xmath1 about @xmath93 .",

    "this storage time @xmath97 is measured by counting the remaining neutrons after a storage period of variable duration .",
    "the inverse of the storage time is the sum of the neutron beta decay rate and the loss rate due to wall collisions : @xmath98 here we have separated the contribution from the normal loss rate @xmath99 ( due to inelastic scattering of neutrons at the surface for example ) and that corresponding to a disappearance in the other brane @xmath100 .",
    "the purpose of trap experiments is to measure the beta decay lifetime of the neutron @xmath101 , by extrapolating the storage time to the ideal case where there is no extra losses .",

    "we reinterpret some of the performed experiments to provide an upper limit on the exotic disappearance probability @xmath1 .",
