    "systems of self - gravitating semi - degenerate fermions in general relativity were studied in @xcite and more recently with applications to dark matter in galaxies in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for a given central temperature parameter ( @xmath5 ) in agreement with the corresponding observed halo circular velocity , there are lower bounds for the central degeneracy parameter ( @xmath6 ) and particle mass ( @xmath7 kev ) above which the _ observed _ halo mass and radius are fulfilled .",
    "the density profiles solutions in this approach present a novel core - halo morphology composed by a quantum degenerate core followed by a low degenerate plateau until they reach the @xmath0 boltzmannian regime .",
    "this interesting overall morphology provides the flat rotation curves in the outermost part of the galaxies as well as a possible alternative to massive black holes in their centers ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the system of einstein equations are written in a spherically symmetric space - time metric @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath11 , together with the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions of tolman @xcite , and klein @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature , @xmath14 the chemical potential , @xmath1 the particle mass and @xmath15 the speed of light .",
    "we then write the system of einstein equations in the following dimensionless way , @xmath16 the variables of the system are the mass @xmath17 , the metric factor @xmath9 , the temperature parameter @xmath18 and the degeneracy parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the dimensionless quantities are : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 the planck mass . the mass density @xmath26 and pressure @xmath27 are given by fermi - dirac statistics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this system is solved for a fixed particle mass @xmath1 in the kev range , with initial conditions @xmath28 , and given parameters @xmath29 ( depending on the chosen central degeneracy ) , and @xmath5 .",
    "we thus construct a sequence of different thermodynamic equilibrium configurations where each point in the sequence has different central temperatures @xmath30 and central chemical potential @xmath31 , so that satisfy the @xmath6 fixed condition .",
    "defining the core radius @xmath32 of each equilibrium system at the first maximum of its rotation curve , or equivalently at the degeneracy transition point in which @xmath33 , we represent the results obtained for each sequence in a central density ( @xmath2 ) vs. core mass ( @xmath3 ) diagram ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "it is shown that the critical core mass @xmath34 is reached at the maximum of each @xmath35 curve .    ) vs. core mass ( @xmath3 ) diagram .",
    "the critical core mass is reached at the maximal value of @xmath3 .",
    "each sequence is built for selected values of @xmath36 and different values of @xmath37 varying accordingly . ]",
    "it is important to emphasize that we are not interested in follow the history of equilibrium states of one specific system .",
    "thus , the standard stability analysis as done for compact stars or in dense stellar cluster ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which is based on the constancy of the entropy per nucleon ( s / n ) along the equilibrium sequence of a given configuration , does not apply here . nonetheless , in computing the @xmath35 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we have explored the full range of @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameters ( including the critical ones ) .",
    "then the equilibrium sequences with constant specific entropy ( s / n ) , which differ from the ones with constant @xmath6 considered here , necessarily must be contained within the full ( @xmath40 ) parameter space covered in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .    in table  [ table:1 ] we show a set of central critical parameters of the model together with the correspondent critical core masses , for a very wide range of fixed central degeneracy parameters @xmath6 and @xmath41 kev@xmath42 .    .critical temperature parameter and normalized chemical potential at the center of each different critical configuration , for different fixed central degeneracies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table:2 ]",
    "the results obtained in tables i and ii imply a marked division in two different families depending on the value of @xmath34 .",
    "_ i _ ) the first family : the critical mass has roughly a constant value @xmath43 .",
    "this family corresponds to large values of the central degeneracy ( @xmath44 ) , where the critical temperature parameter is always lower than @xmath45 and the critical chemical potential @xmath46 const .",
    "physically , these highly degenerate cores are entirely supported against gravitational collapse by the degeneracy pressure . in this case the critical core mass is uniquely determined by the particle mass according the relation @xmath4 ( see also section iii ) .    _ ii _ ) the second family : the critical core mass increases from @xmath43 up to @xmath47 .",
    "this case corresponds to critical cores with a lower central degeneracy compared with the former family ( @xmath48 ) . here",
    "the critical temperature parameter ( @xmath49 ) , is closer to the relativistic regime with respect to the first family .",
    "this result physically indicates that the thermal pressure term has now an appreciable contribution to the total pressure , which supports the critical core against gravitational collapse . in this case",
    "@xmath34 is completely determined by the particle mass @xmath1 , the central temperature @xmath50 and the central chemical potential @xmath51 ( see section iii ) .    in figs .",
    "( [ fig:2 ] ) and ( [ fig:3 ] ) we show a critical metric factor @xmath52 and a critical temperature @xmath53 as function of the radius for the two different families mentioned above .     and @xmath54",
    ". the dashed line corresponds to the isothermality condition , @xmath55 . ]     and",
    "the red line corresponds to the isothermality condition , @xmath55 . ]",
    "we will now attempt to use the critical configurations obtained before to explain the dm distribution in galactic halos , as well as providing an alternative candidate to the standard central black hole paradigm .",
    "from now on , we will use a fixed particle mass of @xmath578.5 kev@xmath42 , being this choice motivated by the fact we want to deal with super massive dark objects having critical core masses of the order @xmath58 .    in figs .",
    "( [ fig:4 ] ) , ( [ fig:5 ] ) and ( [ fig:6 ] ) we show different critical density profiles , critical rotation curves and critical mass profiles respectively , for a wide range of different central degeneracy parameters .     with the correspondent critical temperature parameters @xmath59 . ]     as given in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . to note the high values of @xmath60 km / s in the flat parts of each curve due to the high critical temperature parameters @xmath59 . ]     as given in figs .",
    "[ fig:4][fig:5 ] . ]    from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and table ii we see that critical configuration of self - gravitating fermions with central degeneracies ranging from @xmath61 ( i.e. mainly thermal pressure supported cores ) up to @xmath62 ( i.e. mainly degeneracy pressure supported cores ) , have flat rotation velocities @xmath63 km / s .",
    "this is , well above any observed value .",
    "however , since larger values of @xmath6 imply lower values for @xmath59 , as shown in table i , there is a point ( at @xmath64 and so @xmath65 ) where the _ halo _ rotation curves reach the typical observed value of @xmath66 km / s . nonetheless , since even for @xmath62 we see ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) that the _ halo _ radius is larger than 10 gpc with total critical mass larger than @xmath67 , this is again well above than any observed galactic halo .",
    "we then conclude that any critical configuration belonging to this model is not able to reproduce the halo of galaxies .",
    "moving now to a completely different size scale , this is @xmath68 pc , even though at this scales the critical core masses are of the order of the more massive supermassive black holes in the center of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( see table i ) , the outer part of the system is either too large or have extremely large velocities compared to observations as explained before . even inferred maser velocities on agns , with values up to 1000 km / s on a sub - parsec scale are always below the critical velocity for any value of @xmath6 as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we conclude therefore that critical configurations of semi - degenerate self - gravitating fermions can not be used to model agns .",
    "it is useful to find an analytical formula for the critical mass to try to understand the physics behind it . for this we will use the newtonian hydrostatic equilibrium equation corresponding to the last stable configuration , where the pressure due to gravity is balanced by a high relativistic semi - degenerate fermi gas : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the ultra relativistic approximation of a highly relativistic fermi gas ( @xmath71 ) , which has been expanded up to second order in temperature around @xmath72 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have used in [ lastequil ] the fermi energy ( @xmath73 ) with the rest energy substracted - off in consistency with the theoretical formulation of our model . considering that the density in the cores is nearly constant ( see fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath74 , we can write the core radius as @xmath75 . with this",
    ", we can rewrite ( [ lastequil ] ) as follows , @xmath76 finally , we write the central mass density as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the ultra - relativistic particle number density . with this expression for @xmath79 in ( [ lastequil1 ] ) we can directly give @xmath34 in terms of @xmath6 as : @xmath80    it is clear from this equation that for high central degenerate systems ( @xmath81 ) , the critical core mass @xmath34 is independent of @xmath6 and then proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "however , for low values of the central degeneracy ( @xmath83 ) the second term in ( [ mcranalyt ] ) starts to be relevant , showing the finite temperature effects .",
    "in fact , using @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 , just a 2% difference with the numerical result of @xmath86",
    ". however , for @xmath87 we have @xmath88 , almost a factor 2 above the numerical value of @xmath89 obtained in table i. this shows that our approximation of an ultra - relativistic fermi gas in newtonian equilibrium breaks down and a fully relativistic treatment is needed ."
