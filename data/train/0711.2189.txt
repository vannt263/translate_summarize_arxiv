    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) appears in various extensions of the standard model ( sm ) . in particular",
    ", lepton - flavor - violating decays @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) are discussed in various supersymmetry models  @xcite , models with little higgs  @xcite , left - right symmetric models  @xcite , as well as models with heavy singlet dirac neutrinos  @xcite and very light pseudoscalar bosons  @xcite .",
    "some of these models with certain combinations of parameters predict that the branching fractions for @xmath4 can be as high as @xmath7 , which is already accessible in high - statistics @xmath8 factory experiments .",
    "searches for lfv @xmath0 decays into three leptons have a long history  @xcite beginning from the pioneering experiment of markii  @xcite . in previous analyses ,",
    "both belle and babar reached 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) upper limits on the branching fractions at the @xmath7 level  @xcite , based on about 90 fb@xmath9 of data .",
    "the babar collaboration has recently used 376 fb@xmath9 of data to obtain 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits in the range ( 3.7@xmath108.0 )  @xmath11  @xcite . here",
    ", we update our previous results with a much larger data set ( 535 fb@xmath1 ) collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath2 collider  @xcite , taken at the @xmath12 resonance and 60 mev below it .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) , all located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath13 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "leptons are identified using likelihood ratios calculated from the response of various subsystems of the detector . for electron identification",
    ", the likelihood ratio is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the likelihoods for electron and non - electron , respectively , determined using the ratio of the energy deposit in the ecl to the momentum measured in the svd and cdc , the shower shape in the ecl , the matching between the position of the charged track trajectory and the cluster position in the ecl , the hit information from the acc , and the @xmath17 information in the cdc  @xcite . for muon identification ,",
    "the likelihood ratio is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the likelihoods for the muon , pion and kaon hypotheses , respectively , based on the matching quality and penetration depth of associated hits in the klm  @xcite .    in order to estimate the signal efficiency and to optimize the event selection , we use monte carlo ( mc ) samples .",
    "the signal and the background events from generic @xmath22 decays are generated by kkmc / tauola  @xcite . in the signal mc , we generate @xmath22 , where a @xmath0 decays into three leptons using a 3-body - phase - space model  @xcite , and the other @xmath0 decays generically .",
    "other backgrounds , including @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) events , bhabha events , @xmath26 , and two - photon processes are generated by evtgen  @xcite , bhlumi  @xcite , kkmc and aafh  @xcite , respectively .",
    "all kinematic variables are calculated in the laboratory frame unless otherwise specified .",
    "in particular , variables calculated in the @xmath2 center - of - mass ( cm ) system are indicated by the superscript `` cm '' .",
    "we search for @xmath22 events in which one @xmath0 ( the signal @xmath0 ) decays into three leptons , and the other @xmath0  ( the tag @xmath0 ) decays into one charged track , any number of additional photons and neutrinos .",
    "candidate @xmath0-pair events are required to have four tracks with zero net charge .",
    "the following final states are considered : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the event selection is optimized mode - by - mode since the backgrounds are mode dependent .",
    "the event selection starts by reconstructing four charged tracks and any number of photons within the fiducial volume defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the polar angle relative to the direction opposite to that of the incident @xmath35 beam in the laboratory frame .",
    "the transverse momentum ( @xmath36 ) of each charged track and the energy of each photon ( @xmath37 ) are required to satisfy @xmath38 0.1 gev/@xmath39 and @xmath40 gev , respectively . for each charged track",
    ", the distance of the closest point with respect to the interaction point is required to be less than @xmath410.5 cm in the transverse direction and less than @xmath413.0 cm in the longitudinal direction .",
    "using the plane perpendicular to the cm thrust axis  @xcite , which calculated from the observed tracks and photon candidates , we separate the particles in an event into two hemispheres .",
    "these are referred to as the signal and tag sides .",
    "the tag side contains one charged track while the signal side contains three charged tracks .",
    "we require all charged tracks on the signal side to be identified as leptons .",
    "the electron ( muon ) identification criteria are @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and momentum greater than 0.3 gev/@xmath39 ( 0.6 gev/@xmath39 ) .",
    "the electron ( muon ) identification efficiency is 91% ( 85% ) while the probability to misidentify a pion as an electron ( a muon ) is below 0.5% ( 2% ) .    to ensure that the missing particles are neutrinos rather than photons or charged particles that pass outside the detector acceptance , we impose requirements on the missing momentum @xmath44 , which is calculated by subtracting the vector sum of the momenta of all tracks and photons from the sum of the @xmath35 and @xmath45 beam momenta .",
    "we require that the magnitude of @xmath44 be greater than 0.4 gev/@xmath39 , and that its direction point into the fiducial volume of the detector .    to reject @xmath46 background , we require that the magnitude of thrust ( @xmath47 ) be 0.90 @xmath48 0.97 for all modes except for the @xmath49 mode , for which it is 0.90 @xmath50 0.96 .",
    "we also require @xmath51 gev @xmath52 gev , where @xmath53 is the total visible energy in the cm system , defined as the sum of the energies of the three leptons , the charged track on the tag side ( with a pion mass hypothesis ) , and all photon candidates .",
    "since neutrinos are emitted only on the tag side , the direction of @xmath44 should lie within the tag side of the event .",
    "the cosine of the opening angle between @xmath44 and the charged track on the tag side in the cm system , @xmath54 , is required to lie in the range @xmath55 .",
    "this upper limit reduces background from bhabha , @xmath56 and two - photon background events , as radiated gammas from the tag - side track result in missing momentum if they overlap with the ecl clusters of the tag - side track  @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed mass on the tag side using a charged track ( with a pion mass hypothesis ) and photons , @xmath57 , is required to be less than 1.777 gev/@xmath58 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cut_fig ] , reasonable agreement between data and the background expectation from mc simulation is obtained in the distributions of @xmath54 and @xmath57 .",
    "conversions ( @xmath59 ) are a large background for the @xmath60 and @xmath30 modes . for these modes ,",
    "if the invariant mass of the @xmath2 pair ( @xmath61 ) is less than 0.2 gev/@xmath58 , we require that the cosine of the opening angle in the cm system between the momentum of the @xmath2 pair and the momentum of the other lepton ( @xmath62 ) be less than 0.90 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : convsersion ] for the @xmath49 mode ( two entries for each event ) , the signal efficiency is not affected by this cut , while the large background from conversions is substantially reduced .    for the @xmath49 and @xmath63 modes , the charged track on the tag side is required not to be an electron by applying @xmath64 ; this reduces large backgrounds from two - photon and bhabha processes that remain .",
    "furthermore , we reject the event if the charged track on the tag side traverses the gap between the barrel and the endcap of the ecl . to reduce bhabha and @xmath56 backgrounds",
    ", we require that the momentum in the cm system of the charged track on the tag side be less than 4.5 gev/@xmath39 for the @xmath49 and @xmath65 modes .",
    "finally , to suppress backgrounds from generic @xmath22 and @xmath46 events , we apply a selection based on the magnitude of the missing momentum @xmath66 and the missing mass squared @xmath67 for all modes except for @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we do not apply this cut for the latter two modes since backgrounds in these cases are much smaller .",
    "we apply different selection criteria according to the lepton identification of the charged track on the tag side , as the number of emitted neutrinos is two if the track is an electron or muon ( leptonic tag ) while it is one if the track is a hadron ( hadronic tag ) .",
    "the selection criteria are listed in table  [ tbl : misscut ] ; the distributions of @xmath67 and @xmath70 for hadronic and leptonic decays are shown in fig .",

    "the upper limit on the branching fraction ( @xmath75 ) is then given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of @xmath22pairs , and @xmath78 is the signal efficiency . the value @xmath79 is obtained from the integrated luminosity times the cross section of @xmath0-pair production , which is calculated in the updated version of kkmc  @xcite to be @xmath80 nb . the 90% c.l .",
