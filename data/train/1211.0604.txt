    "therefore , the solution   does not correspond to an attractor at any time .",
    "in the previous section , we show that many scalar potentials derived from the generating function of the form   leads the universe to experience a long inflating period .",
    "a natural question is  what happens to the attractor property if the scalar potential does not have the standard form   derived from the generating function ? \" in this section , we present part of the answer by studying the modification of the generating functions under a small change of the potential .    to examine this possibility , we add a small function of the field @xmath216 to the standard potential @xmath4 .",

    "once we know the generating function , the scalar field can be obtained from integrating @xmath242 and the hubble parameter is simply the same as the generating function . in this work ,",
    "we are mainly interested in the stability of the generating equation and their attractor behavior .",
    "therefore , we have analyzed the stability of the generating function and found that a ( quasi-)attractor exists if the generating function takes the form around @xmath34 @xmath243 where ",

    "interestingly , those solutions approach to the _ eternal inflation _ at later times . therefore",
    ", we do not need to bother on the choice of the initial condition for the given potential because most of the randomly chosen initial data will approach the attractor .",
    "we classify the scalar cosmology according to the stability and write down the exact solutions for each case . for the cases with @xmath67 , @xmath18 becomes a later time attractor . for @xmath247",
    ", there is no attractor . for @xmath248 ,",
    "the theory becomes unphysical because the scalar potential or kinetic energy becomes singular at a finite field value @xmath34 . to illustrate these behaviors",
    ", we develop several exact solutions of the einstein - scalar field equation for various scalar potentials .",
    "for @xmath67 , we present the cosmology with @xmath249 and @xmath136 scalar field including higher order interactions . for most cases ,",
    "the scalar potentials are very flat because there is no mass term . for @xmath195",
    ", we present the cosmology with a free scalar field .",
    "the most interesting example is the @xmath134 case , the cosmology with a massive - interacting scalar field .",
    "the generating function becomes an attractor if the mass - squared is positive definite and the system is weakly coupled , @xmath250 . if the mass - squared is negative or the system is strongly coupled , on the other hand , it develops a quasi - attractor .",
    "this implies that the scalar field fails to arrive at @xmath34 by an extremely tiny gap .",
    "the gap is so small that an exponentially long period of inflation happens during the scalar field stays around @xmath34 even though it is not eternal .",
    "we additionally examined the possibility whether small changes of the potential may modify the ( quasi-)attractor property or not .",
    "we found that a small addition on the potential wo nt change the attractor property for @xmath251 .",
    "however , we also found that the small addition on the potential dispels the quasi - attractor property for @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , if the mass - squared is negative or the coupling is strong @xmath252 , the universe will have less chance to get a long inflation unless the potential is exactly the same as eq .   satisfying eq .  .    in summary , in the presence of an attractor",
    ", the universe approaches to an eternal - de - sitter - like inflation driven by the potential energy , @xmath253 . in this model of inflation , we do not need to impose artificial conditions such as the slow - rolling which constrain the motion of scalar field to give enough @xmath254-folding for the inflation .",
    "the long period of inflation is nothing but a consequence of the evolution of the universe .",
