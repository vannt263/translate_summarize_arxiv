    "some of the most intriguing questions in low temperature physics concern the ways in which superconductors lose their superconducting properties , because of thermal or quantum fluctuations .",
    "mike tinkham has long been fascinated with these issues , and has done much to advance our understanding of the subject .    an early contribution in this area",
    "was the work of newbower , beasley and tinkham on effects of fluctuations on the superconducting transition of tin whisker crystals @xcite .",
    "experimental data were compared with theories of thermally activated phase slips , both in the linear regime and in the non - linear regime of finite current flows .",
    "more recently , tinkham and collaborators studied the loss of superconductivity in very thin wires of moge , deposited on carbon nanotubes , where quantum fluctuations are involved @xcite-@xcite .",
    "related work from tinkham s laboratory , in recent years , has elucidated the breakdown of superconductivity in ultrasmall metallic grains , measured by the even - odd alternation of coulomb - blockade energies  @xcite , vortex motion and resistance in high temperature superconductors  @xcite , and critical currents in frustrated arrays of josephson junctions .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the decay of supercurrents in liquid @xmath0he and in bose - einstein condensates of ultracold atoms has much in common with the decay of superconductivity .",
    "concepts of flux - line motion , and of phase slips due to thermal or quantum fluctuations , appear in both cases .",
    "a new dimension has been added to the subject by recent experimental advances , where cold atoms have been trapped in a region that contains a spatially periodic potential , produced by optical standing waves ( see for example [ ] ) . the ability to vary continuously the parameters of the system , by changing the strength of the periodic potential , as well as by varying the number of trapped atoms and the shape of the overall confining potential , allows one to explore new regimes of parameters and to make more precise confrontations between theory and experiment . in turn , these developments give added urgency to the theoretical study of supercurrent decay .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss similarities and differences between the decay of supercurrents in superconductors and systems of trapped atoms , and we present some new results for the latter . specifically we consider certain experimental procedures which have become standard in systems of ultra cold atoms . in the first scheme ,",
    "a condensate is prepared on a lattice with a specified intensity , when the lattice is suddenly accelerated to a finite velocity . in other words ,",
    "a moving condensate is prepared in the lattice frame , essentially fixing the phase gradient .",
    "a similar experiment in superconductors would involve threading a flux through a closed superconducting loop .",
    "such sudden lattice boosts were applied by several groups to demonstrate a dynamical instability of the superfluid when the imposed phase gradient exceeds @xmath1 per unit cell@xcite .",
    "a related experiment involves tilting the lattice , thus subjecting the atoms to a linear potential .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing a constant voltage on a superconductor .",
    "the technique was used , for example , to demonstrate bloch oscillations of a condensate@xcite . in a third experimental sequence",
    ", one can prepare a moving condensate , then continuously increase the depth of the lattice toward the superfluid- mott insulator transition",
    ".    the response of the atomic system to the perturbations , can be measured , by direct observation of the time evolution .",
    "decay of the current , for example , is observed by repeated experiments , where atoms are released from the trap after varying waiting periods .",
    "the phase gradient in the superfluid at the time of release may be inferred from a _ time of flight _ measurement of the momentum distribution .",
    "this should be contrasted with superconductors , where measurements probe i - v characteristics .",
    "besides the differences in the experimental observation procedures , there are unique features of trapped atom systems which influence the physics of supercurrent decay .",
    "first , to a very good approximation such systems can be considered perfectly clean .",
    "super - currents decay only due to breaking of galilean invariance by the periodic potential .",
    "a second feature that distinguishes the dynamics of ultra cold atoms is their nearly perfect isolation from the environment . strictly speaking they are always under - damped .",
    "however , we are usually interested in the dynamics of a subset of the system degrees of freedom , such as the super - current . how much the dynamics of the the interesting variables is damped , depends solely on the remaining system degrees of freedom rather than on external dissipation sources . in superconductors on the other hand ,",
    "the order parameter is invariably in strong contact with other degrees of freedom , and therefore its dynamics is almost always overdamped .",
    "ultra cold atoms in an optical lattice , confined to the lowest bloch band are described by the well known bose hubbard hamiltonan : h =- j_ij(a_i a_j+ ) + _ i n_i(n_i-1 ) , [ bhm ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the hopping amplitude and the on - cite repulsive interaction , @xmath4 denotes pairs of nearest neighbor sites .",
    "another implicit parameter in this hamiltonian is the average number of bosons per site , @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we shall be primarily concerned with the case where @xmath5 is a large integer .",
    "we shall address to separate regimes , the first is defined by the conditions @xmath6 , while the second regime corresponds to the superfluid near the transition to a mott insulator ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "if the condition @xmath8 holds , then the interactions are sufficiently strong to suppress amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter , and ( [ bhm ] ) can be mapped to the quantum phase model : h =- jn_(_i-_j)-_i ( ) ^2 [ qpm ] the additional condition @xmath9 ensures that the system is far from the superfluid - insulator transition , and facilitates a semiclassical approximation . in the classical limit",
    "the boson creation and annihilation operators can be treated as complex numbers subject to discrete gross - pitaevskii equations  @xcite : id_jd t =- j_ko_k+u|_j|^2_j , [ gp1 ] where the set @xmath10 contains the nearest neighbors of site @xmath11 . in the quantum rotor limit",
    "@xmath8 the number fluctuations can be integrated out leaving us with only the equations of motion for the phase @xmath12 : = -2ujn_ko(_k-_j ) .",
    "[ gp2 ] alternatively eq .",
    "( [ gp2 ] ) immediately follows from the hamiltonian  ( [ qpm ] ) . both equations ( [ gp1 ] ) and ( [ gp2 ] ) can support stationary current carrying states @xmath13 . a simple linear stability analysis of shows  @xcite that these states become unstable towards small perturbations when the phase twist exceeds @xmath1 per unit cell .",
    "the onset of this instability is signaled by appearance of imaginary frequencies .",
    "so @xmath1 is the critical phase twist above which a uniform superfluid state breaks down .",
    "this instability was recently observed experimentally  @xcite .    in principle , one can identify another type of instability , characterized by appearance of negative frequencies , in systems described by eq .",
    "( [ gp1 ] )  @xcite . in general this occurs at a phase twist @xmath14 .",
    "however , in the quantum rotor limit @xmath8 , where we work , the two instabilities coincide .",
    "while the modulational instability occurs precisely at @xmath15 for @xmath16 , we expect that the current can decay at smaller momenta due to either quantum or thermal fluctuations ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "we envision the following experimental scheme to observe this .",
    "the condensate is either boosted to a state with a certain phase gradient or gradually accelerated . following the boost or",
    "while the system is accelerating we probe the evolution of the phase gradient .",
    "if the system is sufficiently close to the modulational instability , i.e. @xmath17 is slightly below @xmath1 , the coherent motion of the condensate is expected to decay , the larger the phase gradient , the faster this decay will occur .",
    "the other regime we shall address , is that of the superfluid close to the quantum phase transition to a mott insulator at commensurate filling ( i.e. @xmath18 ) . for simplicity",
    "we also assume that @xmath19 .",
    "since the coherence length @xmath20 diverges at the transition , one can use a continuum semiclassical description , after coarse - graining the system , to describe the static and dynamic properties of the condensate . at commensurate filling",
    "the appropriate quantum action written in terms of the superfluid order parameter reads :  @xcite s = cd^d x dt |ddt|^2-||^2 + ||^2 - 12||^4 , [ gl ] where length is measured in units of @xmath20 and time in units of @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the sound velocity .",
    "@xmath23 is a numerical prefactor .",
    "the bare parameters @xmath20 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 can be found using a mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "for the cubic d - dimensional lattice they read : = 1 , c=2jn , c=12 ( 2d)^d/2(1-u)^3-d2 , where we introduced the dimensionless interaction @xmath24 with @xmath25 the critical interaction strength in the mean field approximation . the action ( [ gl ] ) correctly describes low energy dynamics of the system in the vicinity of the phase transition , only if the couplings @xmath20 , @xmath22 , @xmath26 and @xmath23 are properly renormalized .",
    "while in three dimensions the effects of such renormalization should be weak , in two and especially one dimensional cases they strongly modify the couplings and the critical exponents .",
    "the bare mean field parameters can then be used only as an estimate . note that the dimensionless part of the action  ( [ gl ] ) is general , and so are the conclusions we reach in this paper , once the renormalized , rather than mean field parameters are used in the prefactors .",
    "the action ( [ gl ] ) is obviously extremized by stationary current - carrying states : @xmath27 .",
    "it is easy to check  @xcite that these states are stable with respect to small fluctuations for @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath20 diverges at the phase transition , the critical phase twist vanishes at that point as it should .    a possible experimental procedure to measure the decay rate at low currents follows .",
    "a condensate with a specified phase gradient is prepared in a weak lattice ( small @xmath29 ) .",
    "then , the lattice potential is gradually increased in time , driving the system closer to the mott phase .",
    "this , in turn , results in the increase of the correlation length @xmath20 and in decrease of the critical momentum @xmath30 . as @xmath30 approaches @xmath17 the superfluid current",
    "is expected to decay either due to quantum or thermal fluctuations .",
    "in this section we describe how the superfluid current decays in a lattice when @xmath17 is below @xmath30 .",
    "we shall consider first the gross - pitaevskii regime @xmath16 in the quantum rotor limit @xmath31 .",
    "due to either thermal or quantum effects .",
    "we first discuss the decay of superfluid currents within the quantum phase model , well away from the superfluid insulator transition ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the action corresponding to the quantum rotor model ( [ qpm ] ) is given by s = d _ j 12u(d_jd)^2 -_j , j^ 2jn(_j-_j^ ) , [ s8 ] or after the rescaling @xmath32 : s = s , [ s5 ] where s= d _",
    "j 12(d_jd)^2 -_j , j^ 2(_j-_j^ ) .",
    "[ s9 ] to leading order in @xmath33 , which plays the role of the effective planck s constant for this problem  @xcite , the tunneling rate depends on the action @xmath34 , associated with the bounce solution of the classical equations of motion in the inverted potential  @xcite : e^-s_b , clearly the action should vanish at @xmath15 , since at this point the spectrum becomes unstable and the tunneling barrier disappears .",
    "deep in the superfluid regime @xmath35 , the tunneling is effective only if @xmath17 is close to @xmath1 , where the product @xmath36 is not too large . in this case",
    "one can make further progress in calculating the tunneling action by expanding ( [ s9 ] ) up to cubic terms in phase differences @xmath37 : s_j,*k * d. [ s6a ] here we explicitly split the site index into longitudinal ( @xmath11 ) and transverse ( @xmath38 ) components . also , for the convenience , we shifted the phase @xmath39 so that the metsatbale state now corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "note that at @xmath41 only longitudinal modes become soft , acquiring a prefactor @xmath42 in front of the quadratic term in the action .",
    "this implies that we can safely use continuum approximation for the phases along the transverse directions .",
    "then instead of ( [ s6a ] ) we derive : s_j dd^d-1 x .",
    "[ s6b ] in this equation @xmath43 denotes transverse coordinates which reside in a @xmath44 dimensional space . upon rescaling = ( p ) ,",

    ". we will provide its detailed variational derivation elsewhere  @xcite and here just quote the results : @xmath46 .",
    "> from the scaling ( [ scaling1 ] ) it is obvious that the characteristic transverse dimension of the instanton @xmath47 scales as @xmath48 , justifying the continuum approximation . above @xmath49",
    "the tunneling action would experience a discontinuous jump at @xmath15 .",
    "however , since we deal with @xmath50 , the action always continuously vanishes at @xmath41 . in this way we derive the asymptotic decay rate of a uniform current state near the modulation instability : e^-s_d with s_ds_d(/2-p)^6-d2 .",
    "[ sd ]      to calculate the exponent , characterizing the thermal decay rate one has to compute the difference of energies of the metastable state and the saddle - point , which separates two adjacent metastable minima  @xcite . both saddle - point and metastable configurations are the stationary solutions of the equations of motion ( [ gp2 ] ) : _ ko(_k-_j)=0 .",
    "[ eq7 ] the metastable state corresponds to the uniform phase twist : @xmath51 .",
    "the saddle - point state relevant for the durrent decay can be easily found in one dimension : _",
    "j=\\ {    ll p^j & j<0 + + p^(j-2 ) & j1    . , [ eq8 ] where @xmath52 if we use periodic boundary conditions for the system with @xmath53 sites .",
    "the energy difference between the two states in the limit @xmath54 is e=2jn(2p - p(-2p ) ) .",
    "correspondingly the decay rate is proportional to e^-e = e^-2jn(2p- ( - 2p)p ) .",
    "[ s12 ] in particular when @xmath55 we have : e^-43nj(/2-p)^3 . in higher dimensions",
    "we can not find the energy of the saddle - point explicitly for all values of @xmath17 .",
    "however , similarly to the quantum case , at @xmath17 close to @xmath1 we can expand the energy functional up to cubic terms in phase differences e_djn_j d^d-1 x , where @xmath56 is the nontrivial solution of the corresponding euler - lagrange equations vanishing at @xmath57 . we again shifted the phase : @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 corresponds to the current state .",
    "after rescaling @xmath60 and @xmath61 we find : e_djn 2^d-12(p_c - p)^7-d2_jd^d-1x .",
    "note that the integral in the expression above coincides with @xmath62 up to a number @xmath63 .",
    "so we immediately conclude that e_ds_d-1 jn ( /2-p)^7-d2 .",
    "note that the activation energy characterizing the thermal decay vanishes faster as @xmath41 than the tunneling action .",
    "it implies that thermal fluctuations become increasingly important and dominate the decay of superfluid current as the system approaches the dynamical instability . comparing the ratio @xmath64 and the tunneling action ( [ sd ] ) we obtain the crossover temperature : t^ c [ tstar ] at which the quantum and thermal decay rates coincide . here",
    "@xmath65 is the sound speed in equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath66 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can fix the temperature to obtain the momentum crossover scale @xmath67 at which thermal and quantum decay rates coincide : /2-p^(s_ds_d-1)^2",
    "( tc)^2 . at phase gradients larger than @xmath67 , thermal decay dominates .",
    "the tunneling action ( [ sd ] ) at this value of momentum is given by s_d^=s_d(s_ds_d-1)^6-d(tc)^6-d .",
    "if @xmath68 , then at the crossover momentum the current decay is exponentially suppressed and will be nonzero only at @xmath17 closer to @xmath1 .",
    "then the thermally activated phase slips will dominate the decay process and quantum tunneling can be ignored . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath69 the current will decay at @xmath70 due to quantum process and the temperature effects are unimportant .",
    "the characteristic crossover temperature separating quantum and thermal decay regimes is thus : t_qacs_d^-7-d6-d(ujn)^12(6-d ) , where @xmath71 is a numerical constant of the order of one .",
    "note that for all relevant dimensions @xmath50 the last multiplier is always of the order of one because of the small exponent @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the crossover temperature @xmath73 is of the order of the sound velocity ( or equivalently josephson energy ) .",
    "let us now address decay of supercurrents in the regime where @xmath18 and large integer filling @xmath5 .",
    "as we already argued , in the vicinity of the mott - insulator phase transition the correlation length @xmath20 becomes large compared to the lattice constant .",
    "one can therefore use a continuum description of the problem  ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "the relativistic dynamics of ( [ gl ] ) is a special feature of the commensurate transition .",
    "ordinary superfluids are described by a similar action , but with a kinetic term including first time derivatives .",
    "the euler lagrange - equations derived from ( [ gl ] ) admit stationary current carrying solutions of the form = e^ipx , we emphasize again that @xmath47 is measured in units of the correlation length @xmath20 .",
    "the current state becomes unstable at @xmath74 .",
    "below @xmath30 the current can still decay due to quantum or thermal fluctuations .",
    "for the thermal decay only the static part of the action needs to be considered .",
    "then there is no difference between our problem and the current decay in ordinary superfluids described by the ginzburg - landau free energy . in particular , in context of superconducting wires , the exponent characterizing the current decay rate in one dimension was computed by langer and ambegaokar  @xcite , and the prefactor setting the time scale was later found by mccumber and halperin  @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding exponent at @xmath75 was obtained by langer and fisher  @xcite",
    ". however , here we are interested in the opposite limit @xmath76 .    for both the thermal and the quantum cases we will use the scaling approach successfully applied above for the quantum phase model in the gross - pitaevskii regime .",
    "we expand the action to cubic order in the amplitude ( @xmath77 ) and phase ( @xmath78 ) fluctuations , about the metastable minimum , and integrate out the gapped amplitude mode .",
    "after the rescaling : x ,  z ,   3 ^ 3/42 the action to leading order in @xmath79 becomes : s = c 3 ^ 9/4-d2^d^5/2-d(p_c - p)^5/2-dd*z*dx ( ) ^2+(^2_x)^2-(_x ) ^3a_d ( 1-u)^1/4 ( p_c - p)^5/2-d [ s_cont ] where @xmath80 denotes all the transverse coordinates relative to the current direction , including time .",
    "@xmath81 is the gradient in @xmath82 dimensions .",
    "accordingly , the quantum decay rate is given by @xmath83 .",
    "a variational calculation@xcite , yields @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as before , to calculate the thermal decay rate one simply has to substitute @xmath86 , so that _ t(d)(-(2d)^-3/4(1-u)^1/4 a_d-1(p_c - p)^7/2-d ) . in the one - dimensional case the relevant constant @xmath87 .",
    "it is interesting to contrast these results with the asymptotic decay rate ( [ sd ] ) , found in the gross - pitaevskii regime .",
    "first we observe that the tunnelling action close to the mott insulator vanishes as a smaller power of @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath88 the scaling hypothesis for the quantum decay rate breaks down , suggesting that @xmath89 is discontinuous at the critical current and is dominated by the fluctuations of a finite ( not diverging as @xmath76 ) length scale .",
    "we therefore expect that in three dimensions at zero temperature the instability marks a sharp localization transition . at finite @xmath90 ,",
    "thermal fluctuations broaden this transition , because the activation barrier energy vanishes at @xmath30 for @xmath91 .",
    "the quantum to thermal crossover for a given dimensionless interaction and phase gradient is found by comparing the two decay rates . in one and two dimensions we find t^(p)=(p_c - p ) .",
    "[ tstarp ] in three dimensions @xmath92 because the quantum decay is effectively suppressed .",
    "as discussed above for the quantum phase model , there is a more useful @xmath17 independent , crossover temperature scale . using the same arguments as in the gross - pitaevskii we can find the temperature separating the quantum and thermal decay regimes : t_q~jn a_d-1 a_d^-7 - 2d5 - 2d(1-u)^-110 - 4d . we see that near the mott transition the crossover temperature strongly depends on interaction @xmath29 .",
    "thus as @xmath93 then in one and two dimensions @xmath94 so the quantum decay always dominates over the thermal . in particular in two dimensions we find @xmath95 and in the one dimensional case @xmath96 , i.e. the crossover temperature is very high and the thermal decay is unimportant .",
    "except for the zero temperature decay in the continuum relativistic model in three dimensions , there is no sharp transition between superfluid current carrying state and the insulating state with no current . indeed , in all other cases the tunneling action and the energy barrier continously vanish as the system approaches the point of the modulation instability .",
    "thus , instead of a sharp transition boundary we can define a broad crossover region , say @xmath97 , which separates the superfluid phase with a relatively slow current decay and the insulating phase with a fast decay .",
    "the fact that the transition is broad does not imply , however , that within a single experiment a gradual current decay will be detected as the system slowly tuned through the crossover region .",
    "the tunneling and thermal decay rate define a probability of creating a single phase slip per lattice site . in the following evolution",
    "the phase slip can either rapidly release its energy into phonon ( bogoliubov s ) modes and bring the system to a next metastable minimum with a lower current , or it can trigger the current decay in the whole system .    in a closed system , i.e. with no coupling to the environment , these two regimes are well defined because the damping of the phase slip comes from the internal degrees of freedom , which are completely described by the equations of motion . also near the critical current",
    "there should be very little difference between the overdamped and underdamped regimes in the thermal and quantum cases .",
    "this is because the energy barrier is very small and the classically allowed motion after the tunneling event starts very close to the metsatable maximum . to see which of the regimes is realized in our systems we numerically solve the classical ( gross - pitaveskii ) equations of motion ( [ gp1 ] ) .",
    "we start from a uniform current state in a periodic lattice . to allow for a current decay",
    "we add small fluctuations to the initial values of the classical fields @xmath98 .",
    "this mimics the effect of thermal fluictuations . in fig .",
    "[ fig_damp ] we plot the computed current versus time for a one - dimensional array of @xmath99 sites . initially the system is asumed to be noninteracting ( @xmath100 ) macroscopically occupied state with a given phase gradient @xmath17 ( specifically we consider @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) and unit hopping .",
    "then interaction is gradually increasing in time and reaches some constant value and the we follow the time evolution of the current .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the phase slips in the smaller current case ( @xmath102 ) are overdamped leading to gradual decay . with the used parameters the total winding number",
    "is @xmath103 and the figure clearly shows that each phase slip decreases the current by roughly ten percent . on the other hand for the larger current ( @xmath101 ) a single phase slip generates immediate current decay in the whole sample and this corresponds to the underdamped regime .",
    "we will not attempt here to find the precise boundary between the scenarios , since it is not the purpose of this paper .",
    "we would like to stress that near the instability the system is always in the underdamped regime .",
    "we checked that a similar overdamped to underdamped crossover occurs in other spatial dimensions .",
    "so if @xmath17 is not too small , the in a given experiment one will always see a sharp transition from the superfluid to the insulating regime .",
    "however the precise point , where the current decays will depend on the details of the experiment , for example on the rate of change of external parameters like tunneling , interaction , or the phase gradient @xmath17 if the system is accelerated . on the other hand in the absence of any fluctuations the transition is very sharp and always occurs at @xmath15 .",
    "we can do a similar numerical analysis at small currents close to the mott transition using the action  ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "we find that even close to the critical current the decay is overdamped , i.e. the current decays in steps .",
    "this result is natural because the size of the phase slip in this case is large and hence it is very easy to dissipate the released energy into phonon modes .",
    "we would like to mention that if the motion of phase slips is underdamped then in a truly infinite system the current state is always unstable .",
    "indeed the probability of a phase slip in the whole system is proportional to its size @xmath53 .",
    "if this single phase slip causes triggers the current decay in the whole sample , then obviously a state with a uniform phase gradient can not exist .",
    "in finite size systems these effects are not so crucial , because the decay probability depends exponentially on the couplings and current but only linearly in a system size .",
    "the modulational instability can be observed either by increasing momentum of the superfluid accelerating the condensate or by increasing lattice potential and driving the system closer to the mott transition , while the condensate is in motion .",
    "we showed that because of quantum or thermal effects the current decays before the system becomes classically unstable .",
    "therefore instead of a sharp transition , there is a crossover region where the decay rate grows from being exponentially small to large .",
    "the crossover region becomes narrower either deep in the superfluid regime ( i.e. @xmath9 ) or in higher dimensions . in particular , in the three - dimensional case we always expect a very sharp boundary separating the regions with very weak and very strong decay rates .",
    "we found that deep in the superfluid regime the crossover temperature separating quantum and thermal decay is of the order of the josephson plasma frequency in all dimensions . at small currents , close to the mott phase",
    ", the decay occurs through thermal fluctuations in three dimensions and through quantum tunneling in one and two dimensions .",
    "we argue that both overdamped and underdamped dynamics of the current decay can be realized in these systems .",
    "the underdamped regime corresponds to high currents close to @xmath15 , while at low currents the dynamics is overdamped .                                                        ) versus time for a one dimensional periodic array of @xmath104 sites with two different initial phase gradianets .",
