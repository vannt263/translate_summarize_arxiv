    "ybagge is a recently discovered yb - based moderate heavy - fermion ( hf ) compound with a kondo temperature of @xmath9 k and a linear coefficient of the specific heat , @xmath10 , of 570 mjk@xmath11mole@xmath12 at @xmath13 k and 150 mjk@xmath11mole@xmath12 in the zero - temperature limit @xcite . at low temperatures ,",
    "ybagge shows two magnetic phase transitions , a first - order transition at @xmath14 k and a second - order transition at @xmath15 0.81.0 k @xcite .",
    "the small entropy at low temperatures , only 5% of @xmath16 at @xmath17 k , suggests a small - moment ordering @xcite .",
    "both magnetic phases disappear with the application of a magnetic field of the order of 13 and 48 t , depending on the field orientation @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "non - fermi liquid behavior is observed , with a logarithmic term in the specific heat , @xmath18 , and a linear resistivity , @xmath19 , for fields of the order of 812 t @xcite .",
    "ybagge provides thus an excellent opportunity to study a field - induced non - fermi liquid of a stoichiometric compound in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) .",
    "we have performed neutron scattering studies of single - crystalline samples in the zero - field heavy - fermion regime , which is characterized by both the kondo effect and geometrical frustration .",
    "the measured dynamic magnetic susceptibility has an energy and temperature dependence that is typical for a heavy - fermion compound , but the wave vector dependence is unusual .",
    "ybagge crystallizes in the hexagonal zrnial - type crystal structure with the non - centrosymmetric space group @xmath20 and room - temperature lattice parameters of @xmath21 and @xmath22   ( see figure [ figstructure ] ) @xcite .",
    "the yb@xmath8 ions have @xmath23 electronic configuration , which is the hole counterpart to trivalent ce ( @xmath24 ) ions .",
    "the three yb ions per unit cell occupy the same equivalent site in the lattice and lie on a kagom - like triangular lattice in the basal plane , which for antiferromagnetic coupling leads to geometrical frustration .",
    "the eight - fold @xmath25 multiplet of the yb@xmath8 ion is split into 4 doublets by the crystal electric field .",
    "specific - heat data show a peak at @xmath26 k , which is attributed to the schottky contribution from the first excited doublet at an energy of @xmath27 mev @xcite . however , the peak height is two times higher than expected for a doublet - doublet excitation , implying that the third and fourth doublets also need to be taken into account .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath28 , follows a curie - weiss law at high temperatures with an effective moment of @xmath29 @xcite , i.e. close to the value of the free yb@xmath8 ion , @xmath30 , and a low - temperature easy - plane anisotropy of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "a small maximum at @xmath32 k is seen in @xmath33 @xcite , reflecting the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the corresponding crystal - field scheme , which has the @xmath34-axis as principal axis , has been confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering measurements on a polycrystalline sample , which shows a clear peak at @xmath35 mev @xcite .",

    "higher - order harmonics were removed from the scattered beam by pyrolytic graphite or liquid - nitrogen cooled be filters .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic scattering so obtained is proportional to the dynamic structure factor , @xmath50 where the dynamic magnetic susceptibility , , is obtained from  after subtracting a constant background term , determined at negative energy transfers at low temperatures or at positive energy transfers with the analyzer turned off from the bragg condition by 10 degrees .",
