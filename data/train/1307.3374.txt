    "the plastic crystalline phase is a thermodynamic state characterized by long range translational order and orientational disorder ( od).@xcite nearly spherical molecules , like halogenomethane compounds of the form ccl@xmath1br@xmath2 , with @xmath3=@xmath4 , are typical examples of plastic crystals .",
    "the formation of the od phase is related to the little hindrance to the reorientational processes .",
    "this series of compounds offer the possibility of a systematic investigation of the effect of molecular symmetry , size and intermolecular interactions on the phase sequence and reorientational dynamics .",
    "tetrahalomethanes with @xmath5 molecular symmetry have been the subject of many experimental and computational studies@xcite .",

    ", it transforms at 259 k to a _ fcc _",
    "od phase i. the _ fcc _ od phase can be supercooled down to 230 k @xcite , and melts at 267 k.    in this paper we study ccl@xmath0br in its _ fcc _ plastic and liquid phases . using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the orientational structure and molecular relaxation characteristics in both phases .",
    "our findings indicate a similar short - range orientational order in the two phases , with small differences occurring at very short distances .",
    "the relaxation dynamics , which appears to correspond to a random diffusive mode for the liquid phase , departs from this behavior for the plastic crystalline phase .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii contains a brief discussion on the classification of the relative orientation of the molecules .",
    "section iii describes the model and the simulation methodology .",
    "the results and discussion about orientational order and rotational dynamics are presented in section iv .",
    "finally , section vi contains our concluding remarks .",
    "in a recent paper , rey@xcite proposed a geometrical criterion to classify the relative orientation of two tetrahedral molecules ( xy@xmath8 ) in six well defined classes .",
    "the classes are defined by considering two parallel planes , each one including one x atom from its corresponding molecule and both perpendicular to the line joining the two x atoms .",
    "namely , for the case of ccl@xmath8 , the two parallel planes contain a c atom , and they are normal to the line defined by these two atoms .",
    "the six different classes are denoted by ( 1,1 ) ; ( 1,2 ) ; ( 1,3 ) ; ( 2,2 ) ; ( 2,3 ) and ( 3,3 ) , where the numbers refer to the number of atoms from each molecule located between the two parallel planes . following the original definition , we will call _ corner _ , _ edge _ and _ face _ to those configurations involving molecules contributing with one , two or three atoms to the region between the planes , respectively .",
    "then , a ( 2,3 ) configuration is also referred to as an _ edge - to - face _ configuration .",
    "the classification can be extended to molecules of the type xy@xmath0z by defining subclasses .",
    "we characterize a subclass by the number ( @xmath9 ) of z atoms between the planes .",
    "since there is only one z atom per molecule , @xmath9 takes the values 0 , 1 or 2 depending on the relative orientation of the molecules .",
    "note that two molecules may contribute z atoms adding up to @xmath9 .",
    "for the case @xmath9=1 there is only one possible configuration of the class ( @xmath10,@xmath10 ) , and two possible configurations of the class ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) .",
    "then each one of the original rey s classes is subdivided in three or four subclasses@xcite explicitly defined in table [ table_class ] and denoted as ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) , with @xmath14 .",
    "the probabilities for the six classes of molecules of the type xy@xmath8 , calculated by rey @xcite invoking the geometrical properties of the molecules and numerical integration , are shown in table [ table_pro ] below .",
    "the probabilities of occurrence of the different subclasses can be analytically calculated assuming that the relative orientations of the molecules are independent , or uncorrelated .",
    "this is the case if the spacial distance @xmath15 between the molecules is large ; or strictly speaking , in the asymptotic limit for @xmath16 .",
    "the probability of each subclass is calculated by multiplying the probability of the corresponding class by the ratio between the number of configurations of the subclass to the total number of configurations of the class .",
    "the asymptotic values for the probabilities of the 21 subclasses are given in table [ table_pro ] .",

    "they show the same qualitative behavior .",
    "the main difference between the two is that the curves for ccl@xmath0br are shifted toward larger @xmath15 values , reflecting the effect of the larger size of the br with respect to cl as mentioned above . using simple geometrical arguments it easy to visualize that the _ face - to - face _ configuration can be observed for distances at which no other configuration is possible .",
    "this is reflected in the probability curves , where this case takes all the probability at closest approach . on the other hand , the _ corner - to - corner _",
    "configuration is only possible for sufficiently large separation , coexisting with all the other configurations .",
    "these two cases , plus the combined _ corner - to - face _ configuration , pay the highest entropic price and their asymptotic probabilities are very small .",
    "the remaining three configurations display an oscillating pattern spanning first and second neighboring layers , approaching their limiting values for @xmath27 nm .",
    "a more realistic representation of the same results emerges when the probabilities of the different classes is weighted by the radial distribution function , as displayed in figure [ p6brcl]b .",
    "the somewhat misleading high probability shown for by the _ face - to - face _ configuration becomes a small peak in this new representation that indicates the _ edge - to - edge _ conformation as the most abundant , followed by the _ edge - to - face _ and _ corner - to - edge _ at shorter and longer separations , respectively .",
    "the distance dependent relative orientational probabilities for ccl@xmath0br are split into subclasses and shown in figure 4 , for both , liquid and plastic phases .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the most abundant configurations ; namely , ( 2,2 ) , ( 2,3 ) and ( 1,2 ) .",
    "the relative ordering of the different subclasses is the same in the both phases .",
    "it is also observed that the proportion of the different subclasses relative to the total of the class is , for all @xmath15 , approximately constant and equal to the asymptotic values .",
    "the main difference is in the position of the different peaks corresponding to the subclasses , which occurs according to the size of the atoms involved .",
    "for example , for the ( 2,2 ) class , the ordering in @xmath15 is @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for no br , one br or two br between the planes , respectively . in figure [ potbr2 ]",
    "we show probabilities the _ face - to - face _ configuration and the relative order of the subclasses for the liquid and plastic phases .",
    "the probability of finding these configurations is very small and only relevant at very short distances , as shown by figure [ p6brcl]b .",
    "however it is interesting that for the liquid the subclass of closest approach is with @xmath31 , while for the plastic the three subclasses are all able to reach approximately the same short distance.the positional order in the lattice and its lower thermal energy prevents a definite order of the subclasses .",
    "this effect is also reflected by the probability @xmath32 of having confirmations with @xmath9 substituted atoms between the planes , showed in figure [ pij]a .",
    "the overall distance dependent of @xmath32 is similar for the plastic and liquid phases but small differences are observed at very short distances .",
    "the liquid clearly allows a closer approach for the configurations with less ( or none ) br atoms between the planes . in the ordered plastic phase ,",
