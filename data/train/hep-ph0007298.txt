    "[ intro ]    with the discovery of the top quark at the fermilab tevatron @xcite , the third generation of fermions in the standard model ( sm ) is complete .",
    "however , the question remains , is the top quark `` just another quark ? '' or `` is it something more ? '' .",
    "top is the only quark to have a mass on the same order as the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale , @xmath4 gev , whereas all other observed fermions have masses that are a tiny fraction of this energy .",
    "this enormous mass may be a clue that the top quark plays a special role in the ewsb .",
    "following that line of thinking , many of the proposed extensions of the sm explain the large top mass by allowing the top to participate in new dynamics @xcite , which is connected to the physics providing the mass of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 bosons .",
    "thus , one of the primary motivations for the tevatron run  ii and cern lhc tev , and the lhc is a proton - proton collider with @xmath6 tev . ] is to accurately determine the top quark s properties , to see if any hint of nonstandard physics may be visible , and thus provide information about the mechanism of mass generation @xcite .",
    "top quarks may be produced in pairs at a hadron collider via the strong interaction , through processes such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the rate and kinematic distributions of top quarks produced in this way are a measure of the top s interactions with the gluons .",
    "the top decay proceeds via the weak interaction , and as we shall see does provide interesting information about the chiral structure of the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction @xcite .",
    "however , decays are experimentally relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the interaction by which they are mediated .",
    "for example , in the case of top , there is one sm decay mode , @xmath10 .",
    "if this vertex were somehow modified by new physics to have a different magnitude , it would affect the top s intrinsic width .",
    "however , at a hadron collider the width can not be measured because the experimental resolutions are much larger than the width itself @xcite .",
    "similarly , while observing exotic top decays would certainly be interesting and would suggest what type of new vertices describe the observed decays , it would not determine the magnitude of these new interactions .",
    "even a study of branching fractions compared to the sm decay mode may be misleading , because one must have already measured the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction strength itself through some other means .",
    "these drawbacks lead one to study weak production mechanisms of the top quark , which have cross sections directly proportional to the top s weak couplings .",
    "the @xmath5-@xmath2-@xmath2 coupling will presumably contribute to @xmath11 production , though distinguishing this from the much larger qcd @xmath11 production is most likely hopeless at hadron colliders .",
    "( nevertheless , it can be precisely measured at an electron linear collider ( lc ) @xcite . ) a better process to measure this interaction is the production of @xmath12 , where the @xmath5 can be observed directly . the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction will allow one to produce single top quarks at a hadron collider , and thus directly measure the properties of this interaction .",
    "a further consideration is that new physics characterized by energy scale @xmath13 may be more apparent in higher energy processes , closer to @xmath13 .",
    "thus , new physics contributions to single top production would scale as @xmath14 ( where @xmath0 is the average center of mass energy of the reaction and @xmath15 is a positive integer or zero ) whereas top decay processes scale as @xmath16 . at high energy colliders such as the tevatron and lhc , @xmath17 can be considerably larger than @xmath18 , thus enhancing the relative importance of new physics in single top production .",
    "single top production proceeds through three distinct sub - processes at a hadron collider .",
    "the @xmath2-channel @xmath3-gluon fusion mode @xcite involves the exchange of a space - like @xmath3 boson between a light quark , and a bottom ( @xmath9 ) quark inside the incident hadrons , resulting in a jet and a single top quark ( c.f",
    ". figure  [ tchanfig ] ) .",
    "its rate- and @xmath2- channel processes ) and cteq4l ( for the mode ) parton densities @xcite with scales chosen as explained in @xcite , where other choices of parton densities , scale , and top mass are also examined .",
    "the rates of @xmath2 and @xmath19 are summed unless otherwise noted . ]",
    "is rather large at both the tevatron ( 2.4 pb ) and the lhc ( 243 pb ) .",
    "the @xmath0-channel @xmath1 mode @xcite involves production of an off - shell , time - like @xmath3 boson , which then decays into a top and a bottom quark ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ schanfig ] ) .",
    "it has a relatively large rate at the tevatron ( 0.86 pb ) , but is comparatively small at the lhc ( 11 pb ) because it is driven by initial state anti - quark parton densities .",
    "finally , the mode @xcite of single top production involves an initial state @xmath9 quark emitting a ( close to ) on - shell @xmath20 boson , resulting in a final state ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ twfig ] ) .",
    "because of the massive particles in the final state , this mode has an extremely small rate at the tevatron ( 0.088 pb ) , but is considerable at the lhc ( 51 pb ) where more partonic energy is available .",
    "each mode has rather distinct event kinematics , and thus are potentially observable separately from each other @xcite .",
    "= 1.8 in    = 1.25 in    = 1.5 in    as we consider various new physics effects in single top production below , it will be important to keep in mind how accurately these rates will be measured at the tevatron run  ii and lhc . at the tevatron , the combined statistical and theoretical uncertainties for the @xmath0- and @xmath2- channel processes will be on the order of @xmath21 @xcite , and the rate will most likely be too small to measure . at the lhc , the statistical uncertainties will be close to zero , and the theoretical uncertainties on the order of @xmath22 for the @xmath0- and @xmath2-channel processes @xcite , and on the order of @xmath23 for the process @xcite . however , systematic uncertainties ( including the efficiency for separating the signal from the backgrounds ) are likely to dominate these lhc estimates .",
    "as we will see below , the three modes of single top production are sensitive to quite different manifestations of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "thus , taken together , they are a comprehensive probe of the top quark s interactions . in this article , we analyze several possible signals of new physics that could manifest themselves in single top production .",
    "these signals can be classified as to whether they involve the effects of a new particle ( either fundamental or composite ) that couple to the top quark , or the effect of a modification of the sm coupling between the top and other known particles .",
    "these two classifications can be seen to overlap in the limit in which the additional particles are heavy and decouple from the low energy description . in this case",
    "the extra particles are best seen through their effects on the couplings of the known particles .",
    "one particular aspect of both of these sets of new physics is the possibility of cp violation in top observables .",
    "we will not address this issue in detail ; the interested reader is referred to the recent review @xcite on this subject .",
    "this article is organized as follows ; in section  [ extrap ] , we investigate what sort of particles beyond those in the sm could contribute to single top production at a hadron collider , and what effects could be seen . in section  [ modint ] ,",
    "we study the effects of non - standard top interactions . in section  [ polarization ] , we examine how one may use polarization observables to further learn about nonstandard physics in the top sector . in section  [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize the picture which emerges as the way in which the properties of top may be systematically extracted from the available observables .",
    "many theories of physics beyond the sm predict the existence of particles beyond those required by the sm itself .",
    "examples include both the fundamental superpartners in a theory with supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , and the composite higgs bosons found in top - condensation and top - color models @xcite . in order for some kind of additional particle to contribute to single top production at tree level at a hadron collider",
    ", the new particle must somehow couple the top to one of the lighter sm particles .",
    "thus , the new particle may be either a boson ( such as a @xmath24 vector boson that couples to top and bottom ) or a fermion ( such as a @xmath25 quark that couples to the @xmath3 boson and top ) .",
    "additional fermionic particles can couple the top and either one of the gauge bosons or the higgs boson . in order to respect the color symmetry",
    ", this requires that the extra fermion occurs in a color triplet , and thus it is sensible to think of it as some type of quark . in order to be invariant under the electromagnetic symmetry , this",
    "new `` quark '' should have either electric charge ( @xmath26 ) @xmath27 or @xmath28 so that one may construct gauge invariant interactions between the extra quark , the top quark , and the known bosons .",
    "generally , we can refer to a @xmath29 extra quark as a @xmath30 and a @xmath31 extra quark as a @xmath25 , though this does not necessarily imply that the extra quarks are in the same representation under @xmath32 as the sm top and bottom .",
    "for example , in models where the top mass is generated by invoking a seesaw mechanism , there are generally either su(2 ) singlet @xcite or doublet @xcite quarks present in the theory .",
    "additional fermions are not generally expected to be a large source of new contributions to single top production , because of strong constraints from other low energy observables @xcite . on the other hand",
    "we will see that there are models with additional fermions to which single top production is a sensitive probe .",
    "extra bosons can contribute to single top production either by coupling top to the down - type quarks , in which case the boson must have electric charge @xmath33 in order to maintain the electromagnetic symmetry , or by coupling top to the charm or up quarks , in which case the boson should be electrically neutral .",
    "there is also the possibility of a boson carrying a combination of color and electric charge that allows it to couple top to one of the lepton fields ( this boson would then carry both lepton and baryon quantum numbers and thus may be labelled a `` leptoquark '' ) .",
    "one theoretically well motivated example of a leptoquark are the gauge bosons corresponding to the generators of a grand unified theory ( gut ) linking the su(2 ) and su(3 ) sectors of the sm .",
    "this gut picture has the leptoquark as part of the gauge interactions , so the question as to whether or not top observables are an interesting means to study leptoquarks becomes a question as to whether or not the leptoquark has some reason to prefer to couple to the top quark . these bosons would be expected to have gut scale masses which in traditional gut theories is far too large to be interesting from the point of view of colliders envisioned in the near future .",
    "another interesting picture of leptoquarks is one in which the sm quarks and leptons are bound states of some more fundamental set of particles ( preons ) . in that case",
    "the question as to whether or not the top quark is a good place to look for evidence of the preons depends on how the model arranges the various types of preons to build quarks and leptons .",
    "however , at a hadron collider the possible light parton initial states available are not suitable for production of a single leptoquark , and thus are not particularly interesting in the context of single top production ) with @xmath34 could play an important role in top decays through a process such as @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this leads to a final state that is identical to a sm top decay , but with a very distinct kinematic structure . ] .",
    "for this reason , we will not focus on leptoquarks in the discussion below .",
    "a simple extension of the sm is to allow for an extra set of quarks .",
    "such objects exist in a wide variety of extensions to the sm .",
    "examples of such theories include the top seesaw versions of the top - color @xcite and top - flavor @xcite models , which rely on additional fermions to participate in a seesaw mechanism to generate the top mass ; susy theories with gauge mediated susy breaking @xcite that must be communicated from a hidden sector in which susy is broken to the visible sector through the interactions of a set of fields with sm gauge quantum numbers ; and even models with a fourth generation of fermions .",
    "direct search limits for qcd production of extra quarks ( at the tevatron , for example ) require that they be quite massive ( @xmath36 gev at the @xmath37 c. l. , depending on the decay mode @xcite ) , and thus they can not significantly affect the single top production rate .",
    "they are best observed either through their mixings with the third family ( and thus their effect on the top couplings ) , or through direct production .    as a particular example",
    ", a fourth generation of quarks could mix with the third generation through a generalized cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , and this could allow @xmath38 to deviate considerably from unity . in this case , all three modes of single top production would be expected to have considerably lower cross sections than the sm predicts . this already shows how the separate modes of single top production can be used to learn about physics beyond the sm .",
    "other types of new physics could scale the three rates independently .",
    "thus , if all three modes are measured to have cross sections that are the same fraction of the sm rates , it is an indication that the new physics modifies the top s coupling to the bottom and @xmath3 ( and not another pair of light particles ) , and further that the modification is the same regardless of the momentum flowing through the vertex ( as is the case with the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction in the sm ) .",
    "= 1.5 in    in fact , it is instructive to examine the experimental constraints on the ckm matrix when one does not impose three family unitarity . the 90% c.l .",
    "direct constraints become @xcite , v & = & (    cccc 0.9722 - 0.9748 & 0.216 - 0.223 & 0.002 - 0.005 & ... + 0.199 - 0.233 & 0.784 - 0.976 & 0.037 - 0.043 & ... + 0 - 0.09 & 0.0 - 0.55 & 0.06 - 0.9993 & ... + ... & ... & ... & ...    ) , with two striking differences from the 3 generation matrix ; @xmath38 may be significantly smaller than unity ( as mentioned above ) but also that @xmath39 may be as large as 0.55 .",
    "( for comparison , the corresponding limit on @xmath39 with 3 generations is @xmath40 @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath41 has a negligible effect on the @xmath2-channel rate of single top production , contributing much less than @xmath42 of the total rate at either tevatron or lhc .",
    "however , if @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( which saturates the unitarity requirement for any number of families and @xmath39 is consistent with the cdf measurement @xmath45 =   0.87^{+0.13 \\ , + 0.13}_{-0.30 \\ , -0.11}$ ] @xcite . ] ) , the nlo @xmath2-channel rate will rise to about 4.07 pb at the tevatron run ii and 334 pb at the lhc , thanks to the much larger @xmath0 quark parton density compared to the @xmath9 quark .",
    "these are huge deviations from the sm rates , and would be a clear indication of new physics . under these conditions , the @xmath0-channel rate , which would fall to @xmath46 of its sm rate . similarly to the @xmath2-channel mode , the rate will be enhanced to 0.19 pb at the tevatron and 78.1 pb at the lhc under these conditions .",
    "in addition to mixing effects , one could also hope to observe direct production of one of the fourth generation quarks , through reactions such as @xmath47 , shown in figure  [ tbprimefig ] .",
    "this process would provide further information on the family structure of the 4 generation model ( @xmath48 ) not readily available from the qcd production of @xmath49 .",
    "the production rates will depend on the magnitude of the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath25 coupling ( @xmath50 in the model with a fourth family ) and the mass of the @xmath25 . in figure  [ bprimeratefig ] we present the nlo rate for @xmath51 production ( as well as @xmath52 production ) without any decay br s . since the @xmath50 dependence may be factored out ,",
    "these rates assume @xmath53 .",
    "the collider signatures resulting from such a process depend on the decay modes available to the @xmath25 . if @xmath54 , it is likely to decay into a top quark and a @xmath20 , and the events will have a @xmath55 pair with an additional @xmath56 boson .",
    "if this decay mode is not open , loop induced decays such as @xmath57 may become important , resulting in a signature @xmath58 plus a hard photon whose invariant mass with the @xmath9 quark will reconstruct the mass of the @xmath25 .",
    "= 5.0 in      another simple extension of the sm is to postulate the existence of a larger gauge group which somehow reduces to the sm gauge group at low energies .",
    "such theories naturally have additional gauge bosons , some of which may prefer to couple to the top ( or even the entire third family ) .",
    "examples of such theories include the top - color @xcite and top - flavor @xcite models , and gauged - flavor symmetry models @xcite which give special dynamics to the third family in order to explain the large top mass . as a specific example",
    ", we will consider the top - flavor model with an extra @xmath59 gauge symmetry that generates a top mass through a seesaw effect @xcite .",
    "this model has an over - all gauge symmetry of su(3@xmath60 su(2@xmath61 su(2@xmath62 u(1@xmath63 , and thus there are three additional weak bosons ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "the first and second generation fermions and third family leptons transform under su(2@xmath66 , while the third generation quarks transform under su(2@xmath67 . as was alluded to before , in order to cancel the anomaly and provide a seesaw mechanism to generate the top mass , an additional doublet of heavy quarks whose left - handed components transform under @xmath68 and right - handed components transform under @xmath59 is also present .    a set of scalar fields transforming under both su(2@xmath66 and su(2@xmath67 acquire a vev , @xmath69 , and break the symmetry to su(2@xmath70 u(1@xmath63 . from here the usual electro - weak symmetry breaking",
    "can be accomplished by introducing a scalar doublet which acquires a vev @xmath71 , further breaking the gauge symmetry to u(1@xmath72 .",
    "we write the covariant derivatives for the fermions as , d^ & = & ^ + i g_l t^a_l ^_l + i g_h t^a_h ^_h + i g_1 b^ , where @xmath73 are the generators for su(2@xmath74 , @xmath75 is the hyper - charge generator , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the gauge bosons for the su(2@xmath74 and u(1@xmath63 symmetries .",
    "the gauge couplings may be written , g_l = , g_h = , g_1 = , where @xmath78 is a new parameter in the theory .",
    "thus this theory is determined by two additional quantities @xmath79 , the ratio of the two vev s , and @xmath80 , which characterizes the mixing between the heavy and light su(2 ) gauge couplings .    at leading order ,",
    "the heavy bosons are degenerate in mass , _",
    "w^ = m_0 ^ 2 ( + ) , where @xmath81 . we can thus parameterize the model by the heavy boson mass , @xmath82 , and the mixing parameter 0.04 , the third family fermion coupling to the heavy gauge bosons can become non - perturbative .",
    "thus we restrict ourselves to considering @xmath83 0.05 .",

    "low energy data requires that the mass of these heavy bosons , @xmath82 , be greater than about @xmath84 gev @xcite .",
    "= 1.5 in    the additional @xmath24 boson can contribute to the @xmath0-channel mode of single top production through virtual exchange of a @xmath24 as shown in figure  [ wpfig ] @xcite .",
    "in particular , if enough energy is available , the @xmath24 may be produced close to on - shell , and a resonant enhancement of the signal may result . since the additional diagrams involve a virtual @xmath24 , they will interfere with the sm @xmath3-exchange diagrams , and thus the net rate of single top production can be increased or decreased as a result , though the particular model under study always results in an increased @xmath0-channel single top rate that interferes non - trivially with the sm @xmath3 exchange in single top production is provided by embedding the gauge fields in extra dimensions @xcite . ] . in figure  [ wpratefig ] the resulting nlo @xmath0-channel rate for @xmath85 at tevatron and lhc",
    "is shown , as a function of the @xmath24 mass , for a few values of @xmath80 .",
    "the rate for @xmath19 production through the same process is shown as well .",
    "while the final state particles for this case are the same as the sm @xmath0-channel mode , the distribution of the invariant mass of the @xmath58 system could show a breit - wigner resonance effect around @xmath86 , which serves to identify this type of new physics .",
    "however , if the mass of the @xmath24 is large compared to the collider energy , and its width broad , the resonance shape can be washed out even at the parton level . jet energy smearing from detector resolution effects will further degrade the resonance and could make it difficult to identify .",
    "= 5.0 in    a @xmath2-channel exchange of the @xmath24 is also possible , but in that case a negligible effect is expected because the boson must have a space - like momentum , and thus the additional contributions are suppressed by @xmath87 , and are not likely to be visible .",
    "this argument applies quite generally to any heavy particle s effect on single top production .",
    "the @xmath0-channel rate is quite sensitive to a heavy particle because of the possibility of resonant production , whereas the @xmath2-channel rate is insensitive because the space - like exchange is suppressed by the heavy particle mass .",
    "clearly , the existence of a @xmath24 will not influence the rate of @xmath88 production , but it could allow for exotic production modes such as @xmath89 . if the @xmath90 has a strong coupling with the third family , then one would expect that its dominant decay should be into @xmath91 , and thus a final state of @xmath92 would result with the @xmath58 invariant mass reconstructing the @xmath24 mass .",
    "current limits on the @xmath24 mass in the top - flavor model make this mode non viable at the tevatron and unpromising at the lhc , with a cross section of 1.14 pb for @xmath93 gev and @xmath94 including the large qcd logarithmic corrections described in @xcite .",
    "however , an observation of this signal would be a clear indication of the nature of the new physics .",
    "scalar particles appear in many theories , usually associated with the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry in a lorentz invariant fashion . in the sm and the minimal supersymmetric extension , fundamental scalar fields of both neutral and charged character are present in the theory , and some are expected to have a strong coupling with the top because of the role they play in generating fermion masses . in dynamical models such as the top - condensate and top - color assisted technicolor models ,",
    "scalar particles exist as bound states of top and bottom quarks @xcite .",
    "these composite scalars also have a strong coupling to the top because of their role in the generation of the top mass .",
    "another way to look at this is that the top mass is large because the strong forces needed to bind tops into higgs result in a strong higgs coupling to top .",
    "this illustrates the fact that the large top mass naturally makes it a likely place to look for physics associated with the ewsb .",

    "= 1.5 in    as a final note , there is the interesting process in which a neutral scalar ( like the higgs boson of the sm ) is produced in association with a single top quark @xcite .",
    "feynman diagrams are shown in figure  [ hstfig ] .",
    "this process is of interest because while the magnitude of the @xmath112-@xmath3-@xmath3 and @xmath112-@xmath2-@xmath2 couplings can be measured independently by studying @xmath113 and @xmath114 ( or the equivalent processes at a high energy lepton collider ) , the relative phase between the couplings can be found from the process @xmath115 , as that phase information is contained in the interference between the two diagrams shown in figure  [ hstfig ] .",
    "this process is extremely small compared to the other two mentioned ( with a sm cross section of @xmath116 fb at the tevatron and 0.06 pb at the lhc for a higgs boson of mass ( @xmath117 ) 110 gev , and including both @xmath2 and @xmath19 production ) , and thus it is not promising a discovery mode .",

    "we show the contributions from each feynman diagram containing either @xmath112-@xmath2-@xmath2 or @xmath112-@xmath3-@xmath3 vertex to the total production rate of @xmath118 as a function of @xmath117 at run ii of the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "though the rates at the tevatron are very small in the sm , with the enhanced coupling of @xmath112-@xmath2-@xmath19 predicted by some models of new physics , this process could conceivably be observed there .",

    "when the @xmath3 decays , the charged lepton ( @xmath182 ) must be right - handed , so it prefers to move against the @xmath3 direction , in the same direction as the top polarization .",
    "also shown in figures  [ toppolfig](c ) and  [ toppolfig](d ) , a similar argument can be made for the @xmath19 spin , but in this case the charged lepton prefers to move against the @xmath19 spin axis . from this point",
    "onward , we restrict our discussion to top quarks , but it should be clear how they apply to @xmath19 as well .",
    "the simple angular momentum argument is reflected in a more detailed computation of the distribution @xcite , & = & ( 1 + ) , where @xmath183 is the angle between the direction of the charged lepton and the top polarization , in the top rest frame , and @xmath184 is the partial width for a semi - leptonic top decay in the sm . in principle , one has only to decide on a scheme for relating the top polarization to some axis , and one can fit the distribution , f ( ) & = & ( 1 + ) + ( 1 - ) , to determine the degree of polarization ( @xmath185 ) along this axis . in practice , there are complications arising from the fact that the endpoints of the distribution tend to be distorted by the kinematic cuts required to isolate the signal from the background , and the fact that in reconstructing the top rest frame , the component of the unobserved neutrino momentum along the beam axis ( @xmath186 ) is unknown .",
    "one may determine this quantity up to a two - fold ambiguity by requiring the top decay products to have an invariant mass that is close to @xmath18 .",
    "however , the ambiguity in this procedure will also have some effect on the distribution , and so careful study is required .",
    "one can also use the asymmetry between events with @xmath187 and @xmath188 to characterize the degree of polarization of the top , which may be helpful if the data set is limited by poor statistics .",

    "the optimized basis improves the helicity basis result at the tevatron by noting that in the sm , the @xmath1 process produces top quarks whose polarization is always along the direction of the initial anti - quark involved in the scattering . at the tevatron ,",
    "the vast majority ( @xmath191 ) of these anti - quarks come from the @xmath192 ( which has valence anti - quarks ) .",
    "thus , one expects that by choosing to measure the top polarization along the @xmath192 direction in the top rest frame , one can raise the degree of polarization from @xmath189 to @xmath193 .",
    "this represents a large improvement for tevatron polarization studies of the @xmath1 process .",
    "however , at the lhc there are no valence anti - quarks , and thus no optimized basis to analyze the @xmath1 top polarization . in that case , the helicity basis is the sensible basis to analyze the polarization of the top quark , and results in a fair degree of left - handed top production .",
    "the discussion of polarization in the @xmath3-gluon fusion process is somewhat tricky , mostly owing to the fact that the detailed kinematics of this process are sensitive to higher orders of perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the kinematic region described by the process @xmath194 is the dominant one , but a precise calculation of the interplay between the @xmath195 scattering contribution and the @xmath196 scattering contribution is still lacking .",

    "in fact , at both tevatron and lhc the @xmath199 sub - process is quite small , and thus the over - all degree of polarization is about @xmath193 . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath196 description shows a degree of polarization that is much lower , and depends on the choice of the regularization scheme for the collinear singularity ( e.g. , the bottom mass ) used in the computation .",
    "this is an indication that this method of computation is not perturbatively stable .",
    "thus , it is fair to say that the degree of polarization in the helicity basis is high , but at the moment no reliable determination is available .",
    "this situation should be improved by including higher order qcd corrections in @xmath3-gluon fusion simulation .",
    "the optimized basis once again makes use of the fact that the top polarization is @xmath197 along the direction of the spectator anti - quark in the reaction . at both tevatron and lhc , this is dominantly the spectator jet in the final state .",
    "this basis thus results in a top which is about @xmath200 polarized along the direction of the spectator jet . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that this basis is not sensitive to the value of the bottom mass , and thus is perturbatively reliable . in other words ,",
    "higher order qcd effects are unlikely to have a large impact on the degree of top polarization in the optimized basis .",
    "as we have seen , new physics may alter the structure of single top production .",
    "it may be that the new physics effects will reveal themselves , and tell us something about their nature by causing a large deviation in one or more of the single top production cross sections .",
    "in that case one can study the distribution of the top polarization in order to learn something further about the nature of the nonstandard production mechanism .    in section  [ extrap ] , it was demonstrated that either a charged scalar top - pion or @xmath24 gauge boson can have a substantial effect on single top production in the @xmath0-channel mode .",
    "assuming for the moment that such a deviation has been observed , one can then use the top polarization in order to narrow down the class of models responsible for such an effect .",
    "the @xmath24 boson couples to the left - handed top and bottom quarks , and thus an analysis of the resulting top polarization will be similar to that of the sm prediction .",
    "namely , the helicity basis will show about @xmath189 of the tops to be left - handed ( @xmath189 at the lhc ) , though the specific numbers show a mild sensitivity to the @xmath24 mass , and the optimized basis will show about @xmath193 at the tevatron .",
    "however , the @xmath95 has a right - handed interaction , completely at odds to the sm .",
    "in fact , there is another difference between the @xmath24 and the @xmath95 that is also very important . like the sm @xmath3 boson ,",
    "the @xmath24 is a vector particle , and thus carries angular momentum information between the initial state and final state in the @xmath0-channel process .",
    "however , the @xmath95 , as a scalar particle , does not carry such information .",
    "thus , the optimized basis , which relies on the correlation between top spin and the initial @xmath201 momentum fails to apply to a scalar production mechanism , and if one were to use it to analyze the polarization of the top coming from this type of new physics effect , one would come to the wrong conclusion that the produced tops were unpolarized . on the other hand , in the helicity basis the top quarks produced from the @xmath95",
    "show very close to @xmath197 right - handed polarization .",
    "this demonstrates the utility of using _ both _ bases .",
    "if there is new physics in single top production , not only is it unclear at the outset which basis will show a larger degree of polarization , but we can use them together to distinguish a vector from a scalar exchange , thus learning about the nature of the new particle without directly observing it .",
    "study of polarization can also be useful in disentangling the operators in the effective lagrangian in equations  ( [ ewcleq1 ] ) and ( [ ewcleq2 ] ) . as we saw , those operators have left - handed and right - handed versions , and thus the distribution of top polarizations will depend on the relative strength of the two .",
    "thus , by studying top polarization , one could begin to disentangle the chiral structure of the operator responsible for a deviation in single top production , giving further insight into the nature of the full theory that accurately describes higher energies .",
    "having gone over in detail the physics one can probe with single top production , it is worth summarizing what we have learned and examining how one can use the different top quark observables to extract information about the top that maximizes the available information . in the preceding sections we have seen",
    "that single top production allows one to measure the magnitude of the top s weak interactions ( in contrast to top decays ) .",
    "the three modes of single top production ( the s - channel @xmath1 , the t - channel @xmath3-gluon fusion , and the modes ) are sensitive to different types of new physics .",
    "all three modes are sensitive to modification of the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction , with the @xmath88 mode distinguished by the fact that it is rather insensitive to most types of new physics .",
    "the @xmath0-channel mode is sensitive to certain types of additional ( heavy ) particles . and the @xmath2-channel mode is sensitive to physics which modifies the top decay properties , in particular to fcnc interactions . in this light",
    ", it is rather unfortunate that the @xmath88 mode is so small at the tevatron that it is not likely to be useful there , as it can allow one to measure the strength of the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 vertex , which would be a good first step in disentangling the information from the @xmath0- and @xmath2-channel modes .",
    "= 6.0 in    = 6.0 in    without the @xmath88 mode , one will most likely have to study the correlation of the @xmath0- and @xmath2- channel rates in the plane of @xmath202 in order to attempt to understand if a new physics effect is present , and how one should interpret it if it is observed .",
    "( @xmath203 and @xmath204 are the cross sections of @xmath1 and @xmath3-gluon processes , respectively . ) in figure  [ sigmaplanefig ] we show this plane for run ii of the tevatron , including the sm point ( with the contour of @xmath205 theoretical uncertainty deviation around it ) and the points from the the top - flavor model ( with @xmath206 gev and @xmath94 ) , the top - color model with a charged top - pion ( with mass @xmath207 gev and @xmath102-@xmath103 mixing of @xmath23 ) , a fcnc @xmath5-@xmath2-@xmath99 operator ( with @xmath208 and @xmath209 ) , and a large @xmath39 under the four quark generation scenario with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "a similar plot is given in figure  [ lhcplanefig ] for the lhc .",
    "this illustrates how to use the knowledge we have about the sensitivity of the @xmath1 and @xmath3-gluon fusion modes to find a likely explanation for a new physics effect .",
    "a deviation in @xmath203 that is not also reflected in @xmath204 is most likely due to the effect of nonstandard particles .",
    "a deviation in @xmath204 that is not also seen in @xmath203 is likely from a fcnc .",
    "a deviation that is comparable in both rates is most likely from a modification of the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction . in the very least , if the sm is a sufficient description of single top production , the fact that the two rates are consistent will allow one to use them to extract @xmath38 with confidence that new physics is not distorting the measurement .",
    "additional information is provided by polarization information . by studying the @xmath3 polarization from top decays",
    ", one learns about the nature of the @xmath3-@xmath2-@xmath9 interaction . by studying the top polarization , in both the helicity and optimized bases",
    ", one can learn more about the chiral structure of nonstandard top interactions , either by probing the chiral structure of the interactions , or even the scalar / vector nature of a virtual particle participating in single top production .",
    "the large top mass seems to be a hint that the mechanism of the ewsb may be more evident in studies of top than in other observables , and thus the tevatron run  ii and the lhc are exciting opportunities to probe the nature of the symmetry breaking . we have seen that by using the three modes of single top production together , along with studies of polarization in top decays and in single top production , one can assemble a coherent picture of the properties of the top .",
    "these observables a sensitive to different kinds of new physics , and thus when considered together can provide a probe of the nature of nonstandard physics manifest in the top sector , or can demonstrate the validity of the sm picture of how the top should behave .",
