    "as described by castor , abbott , and klein ( hereafter cak ) @xcite , mass loss in the form of a high - velocity wind is driven from the surface of ob stars by radiation pressure on a multitude of resonance transitions of intermediate charge states of cosmically abundant elements .",
    "the wind is characterized by a mass - loss rate @xmath0@xmath1 and a velocity profile @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance from the ob star , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the terminal velocity , @xmath6 is the escape velocity , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the mass and radius of the ob star .",
    "as described by hoyle and lyttleton @xcite , bondi @xcite , and shapiro and lightman @xcite , in detached high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , a compact object , typically a neutron star , captures the fraction of the wind of the ob star that passes within the accretion radius @xmath9 of the compact object , where @xmath10 is a constant of order unity , @xmath11 is the velocity of the wind relative to the compact object , @xmath12 is the velocity of the wind at @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the orbital velocity of the compact object , @xmath15^{1/3}$ ] is the binary separation , and @xmath16 is the binary orbital period . the mass - accretion rate onto the compact object @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the wind mass density and @xmath19 is the wind mass - loss rate , hence @xmath20 .",
    "this compact expression expands out to @xmath21 where @xmath22 for an isolated ob star . for the parameters appropriate to the prototypical detached hmxb vela x-1 (  2 ) , , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 d , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , hence @xmath29 cm , @xmath30 cm , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . ]",
    "accretion of this material onto the neutron star powers an x - ray luminosity @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are respectively the mass and radius of the compact object .",
    "the resulting x - ray flux photoionizes the wind and reduces its ability to be radiatively driven , both because the higher ionization state of the plasma results in a reduction in the number of resonance transitions , and because the energy of the transitions shifts to shorter wavelengths where the overlap with the stellar continuum is lower . to first order , the lower radiative driving results in a reduced wind velocity @xmath12 near the compact object , which increases the accretion radius @xmath40 , which increases the accretion efficiency @xmath41 , which increases the x - ray luminosity @xmath42 . in this way , the x - ray emission of hmxbs is the result of a complex interplay between the radiative driving of the wind of the ob star and the photoionization of the wind by the neutron star .",
    "known since the early days of x - ray astronomy , hmxbs have been extensively studied observationally , theoretically @xcite , and computationally @xcite .",
    "they are excellent targets for x - ray spectroscopic observations because the large covering fraction of the wind and the moderate x - ray luminosities result in large volumes of photoionized plasma that produce strong recombination lines and narrow radiative recombination continua of h- and he - like ions , as well as fluorescent lines from lower charge states .",
    "the prototypical detached hmxb vela x-1 has been studied extensively in nearly every waveband , particularly in x - rays , since its discovery as an x - ray source during a rocket flight four decades ago .",
    "it consists of a b0.5 ib supergiant and a magnetic neutron star in an 8.964-day orbit . from an x - ray spectroscopic point of view , vela x-1 distinguished itself in 1994 when nagase et al .",
    "@xcite , using _",
    "sis data , showed that , in addition to the well - known 6.4 kev fe k@xmath43 emission line , the eclipse x - ray spectrum is dominated by recombination lines and continua of h- and he - like ne , mg , si , s , ar , and fe .",
    "these data were subsequently modeled in detail by sako et al .",
    "@xcite , using a kinematic model in which the photoionized wind was characterized by the ionization parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the distance from the neutron star and @xmath46 is the number density , given by the mass - loss rate and velocity law of an undisturbed cak wind [ specifically , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mean atomic weight and @xmath49 .",
    "vela x-1 was subsequently observed with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) in 2000 for 30 ks in eclipse @xcite and in 2001 for 85 , 30 , and 30 ks in eclipse and at binary phases 0.25 and 0.5 , respectively @xcite ; three views of the line - rich eclipse spectrum are shown in figure 1 .",
    "watanabe et al .",
    "@xcite , using assumptions very similar to those of sako et al .  and a monte carlo radiation transfer code , produced a global model of vela x-1 that simultaneously fits the hetg spectra from the three binary phases with a wind mass - loss rate @xmath50 and terminal velocity @xmath51 .",
    "one of the failures of this model was the velocity shifts of the emission lines between eclipse and binary phase 0.5 , which were observed to be @xmath52@xmath53 , while the model simulations predicted @xmath54 . in order to resolve this discrepancy , watanabe et al .",
    "performed a 1-dimensional calculation to estimate the wind velocity profile along the line of centers between the two stars , accounting , in an approximate way , for the reduction of the radiative driving due to photoionization .",
    "they found that the velocity of the wind near the neutron star is lower by a factor of 23 relative to that of an undisturbed cak wind , which was sufficient to explain the observations .",
    "however , these results were not fed back into their global model to determine the effect on the x - ray spectra .",
    "equation 1 suggests that , for a given wind mass - loss rate , the x - ray luminosity should be higher by a factor of ( 2@xmath5581 , or , for a given x - ray luminosity , that the wind mass - loss rate should be lower by a similar factor .",
