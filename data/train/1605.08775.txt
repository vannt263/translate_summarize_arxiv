    "how do molecules form ? this has been recognized as one of the ten unsolved mysteries of chemistry , enumerated in 2013 for the year of chemistry celebration @xcite .",
    "indeed , a new entity emerges when two identical atoms meet .",
    "the reciprocal is also true : as a dimer approaches a catalyst s surface , it may break down .",
    "but when and how does this break down precisely happen ? what distinguishes these two different quantum objects , i.e. the molecule and the two independent atoms ?",
    "it is natural to think that as some control parameter move , e.g. an inter - atomic distance , a sort of discontinuity or phase transition should happen . while a quantum calculation can be set up to simulate such reaction , the calculations of an increasingly realistic system quickly begin to overwhelm even the most powerful computer . while dft calculations hint a change in chemical bonds as the molecule - catalyst interaction increases when the molecule approaches to the surface @xcite , this is confronted with the fact that in a finite system no actual discontinuities can happen .",
    "the key for the molecule formation / dissociation mystery can be found in p. w. anderson s inspiring paper more is different  @xcite .",
    "there , anderson recalled that the inversion oscillations in ammonia - like molecules suffer a sort of transition into a non - oscillating mode as the masses are increased .",
    "much as in a classical oscillator transition to an over - damped regime , the crucial ingredient is the infinite nature of the environment which induces dissipation while preventing the occurrence of poincare s recurrences and enable a dynamical phase transition .",
    "these concepts were formalized in the context of the rabi oscillations in a quantum system : a spin dimer immersed in an environment of spins . since this is solved in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many spins which provide the crucial continuum spectrum .",
    "w1954mathematical , alvarez - levsteinjcp2006 . in this case",
    ", the finite rabi frequency undergoes a non - analytic transition into a non - oscillatory mode as the interaction with the environment increases @xcite .",
    "this mathematical discontinuity was termed quantum dynamical phase transition ( qdpt ) @xcite .    while the application of these ideas to molecular dissociation / formation is not completely straightforward , in a previous paper we succeeded in describing h@xmath0 molecule formation / dissociation in the presence of a catalyst as a qdpt @xcite .",
    "this description was achieved using a variant of the model introduced by d. m. newns for hydrogen adsorption in a metallic surface @xcite . however , that analysis was restricted to the case when _ the molecular axis is perpendicular to the catalyst surface_. in @xcite the environment provides the infinitely many catalyst orbitals whose influence had to be treated beyond linear response .",
    "indeed , the interaction among the crystal states and the dimer orbitals dramatically perturb each other and has to be obtained through a self - consistent dyson equation . in particular , the substrate induces imaginary corrections to the molecular energies , accounting for their finite lifetime . these complex energies , as those obtained from the fermi golden rule , represent resonances and are accounted by a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "our main result was that two _ resonances are formed inside _ the @xmath1 band and that they present analytical discontinuities as a function of the molecule - substrate interaction ( distance ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the _ molecular dissociation / formation _ was identified as the non - analytic _ collapse / splitting of these resonances_.    in this paper , we address another reaction mechanism that is known to occur when a h@xmath0 molecule approaches a catalyst with its _ molecular axis parallel to the surface_. it is found that molecular dissociation is also a phase transition associated to an analytic discontinuity , but of different and unusual nature : the molecule is destabilized by the transition from non - physical virtual states into actual localized states . for the rest of the article we will be dealing with the same model and tools introduced in our previous work @xcite which , in this case , provide substantially new perspective into the molecular dissociation / formation problem .",
    "given a homonuclear molecule ab and a metal electrode with a half filled @xmath1 band , two independent geometries arise to describe the interaction .",
    "the particular configuration of a molecule approaching with its axis perpendicular to the metal surface , was previously investigated in reference @xcite .",
    "a fully different problem arises when the axis along the molecule lies parallel to the surface . in this configuration",
    "the distances between a given atom belonging to the metal surface and both atoms forming the molecule remain equal , i.e. @xmath2 ( see fig . [ esquema ] ) . therefore , both atoms interact identically with the metal , resulting in a completely different hamiltonian respect to the perpendicular case , and hence yielding a dissimilar kind of transition .",
    "to set up the model hamiltonian for the interaction between the molecule and the metal , we write the molecule s hamiltonian as : @xmath3the atomic energies @xmath4 and @xmath5 are identical and their degeneracy is broken by the mixing element @xmath6 that leads to the bonding and antibonding states , i.e. the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , respectively . in this orientation ,",
    "the molecule only can have substantial overlap with the metal @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals of the underlying metallic atom .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 is considered to be perpendicular to the surface and @xmath10 is chosen parallel to the molecular axis .",
    "both orbitals interact with the target molecule in different ways @xcite , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sitios ] . on one side ,",
    "the overlap of the @xmath11 with the atomic orbitals a and b have the same the sign and magnitude , resulting in a hamiltonian coupling element @xmath12 . on the other side",
    ", the molecule also interacts with the @xmath13 orbital of the metal . in this case , while having equal strengths a different sign appears for each atomic orbital .",
    "taking these considerations into account , there are two concurrent mechanisms for molecule - metal interaction : @xmath14where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the metallic orbitals that interact with the molecule .",
    "furthermore , we have included a @xmath17 factor to account for the difference among the interaction strengths with the two @xmath1 orbitals .    in fig .",
    "[ sitios ] we represent explicitly two , assumed independent , sets of metallic @xmath1 orbitals associated with each symmetry of the surface orbitals ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore , the relevant part of the metal hamiltonian can be represented using a narrow band model .",
    "this approximation was first proposed by newns @xcite , who stated that the projection of the @xmath1 band local density of states ( ldos ) over the specific orbital ( either @xmath11 or @xmath8 ) could be schematized as a semielliptic energy band that strongly interacts with the molecule xin2014effects .",
    "this picture is validated by appealing to a lanczos s transformation @xcite to obtain this simple electronic structure for the @xmath1 band .",
    "the basic procedure is visualised in fig .",
    "[ lanczos ] for a two dimensional metal represented as two distinct collections of orthonormal @xmath1 orbitals . by choosing one of the interacting metallic orbitals as a reference , the intermetallic interactions provide ( through the lanczos s procedure ) for combination of atomic @xmath1 orbitals consistent with the initial symmetry .",
    "typically , these are progressively included according to their distance to the initial orbital .",
    "these collectivesubstrate orbitals are naturally arranged in the hilbert space in order to evidence the tridiagonal nature of the hamiltonian in the new basis . by means of this procedure",
    ", the general three dimensional geometry of a catalyst is reduced to a effective linear chain .",
    "the same reasoning applies for both symmetries .",
    "then , we can write the metal @xmath11 hamiltonian as :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the @xmath21-th collective metal orbital obtained by the lanczos s transformation and the energy corresponding to that orbital , respectively . for the sake of simplicity , all the hopping elements @xmath22 are considered to be equal to @xmath23 . this is consistent with the fast convergence of the hopping elements , first addressed by haydock et al .",
    "@xcite . a similar hamiltonian @xmath24 is obtained for the @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "thus , @xmath26    in order to obtain an optimal configuration for our discussion on the dissociation process",
    "@xcite , we make the @xmath1 band to be centered around the fermi energy @xmath27 by making @xmath28 . then , the bonding and antibondig molecular states , i.e. homo and lumo , fall outside the band as @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this choice is consistent with the standard knowledge of the markus - hush theory for optimal conditions of electron transfer and molecular dissociation . in this work ,",
    "we used @xmath30 which is typical for h@xmath31    the main features of the system , i.e. energy spectrum and relevant eigenvalues properties , could be obtained using a decimation procedure levstein - damato , pastawski - medina .",
    "this formulation deploys an infinite order perturbation theory for the interaction @xmath32 to dress the molecular hamiltonian @xmath33 into an effective molecular hamiltonian that accounts for the presence of the catalyst , and yields a complex correction , @xmath34 , to the molecular bonding and antibonding energies .",
    "this is sketched in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "this precisely defined procedure resorts to the green s function matrix associated with the total hamiltonian @xmath35 , @xmath36we are going to profit from the fact that the poles of the green s function are the eigenvalues of the system . at this point ,",
    "a brief introduction to the decimation technique is convenient for the sake of clarity .",
    "let us first consider the molecular hamiltonian without the presence of the metal : @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{e1}\\]]then , the green s function matrix adopts the form : @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{molg}\\]]the green s function for atom a , the first diagonal element of @xmath39 , can be written as @xmath40therefore , the energy of atom a is modified by the presence of the atom b through the self - energy @xmath41this decimation procedure can be extended to the full semi - infinite chain that describes the components of the @xmath1 band that couple with the homo and lumo according to their symmetry .",
    "the procedure consists on dressing  the successive lanczos s orbitals  with the corresponding self - energies to account for the interaction with the neighbour atom at the right . in a finite system of @xmath42 orbitals",
    ", @xmath43 is written in terms of @xmath44 levels of a continued fraction until one reaches the last level . to simplify the study of the spectral density",
    ", the energies of the system can be renormalized by introducing an imaginary small quantity @xmath45 , thus @xmath46 .",
    "this energy correction can be seen as a weak environmental interaction , a role that could be assigned to the @xmath47 band states @xcite .",
    "thus , in the thermodynamic limit of a semi - infinite chain ( @xmath48 ) , the self - energy correction due to the metal becomes :    @xmath49    by setting @xmath50 in the whole system ( i.e. setting down the fermi level as the energy reference ) the analysis is further simplified .",
    "equation sigma has two solutions with different signs .",
    "the solution with physical meaning provides a retarded response and results : @xmath51with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "then , the restriction to the first four orbitals of the total hamiltonian can be written in a simple way : @xmath55 .",
    "\\label{e5}\\ ] ]    now , a basis change can be made to a molecular _ bonding _ and _ antibonding _ representation .",
    "equation [ e6 ] shows the hamiltonian in the new basis .",
    "notice that , the bonding state ( second diagonal element ) does not interact with @xmath56 ( fourth diagonal element ) and the antibonding state ( third diagonal element ) does not interact with @xmath57 ( first diagonal element ) :    @xmath58 .",
    "\\label{e6}\\ ] ]    therefore , the system is naturally detached in two portions in which the green s function matrices can be solved independently . for the bonding subspace ,",
    "i.e. the bonding molecular orbital interacting with @xmath57 , the green s function takes the form :    @xmath59 ,   \\label{e7}\\ ] ]    while , for the antibonding molecular orbital interacting with @xmath60 , there is a subspace where    @xmath61 .",
    "\\label{e8}\\ ] ]    for the rest of the article @xmath62 will be set @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the eigenenergies and resonances of the system are obtained by finding the poles of eqs .",
    "[ e6 ] and [ e7 ] .",
    "this is achieved solving the equations :    @xmath65    equation [ eq - characbonding ] accounts for the poles corresponding to the bonding state interacting with the @xmath11 band and eq .",
    "eq - characantibonding for the poles of the antibonding state interacting with the @xmath8 band .",
    "a first hint for molecular dissociation arises from analysing the molecular bonding orbital that intercats with the @xmath1 band through the @xmath11 orbital , fig .",
    "[ polo+ ] . in this case , eq . [ eq - characbonding ] provides two poles which are bellow the @xmath1 band at the molecular bonding energy @xmath66 .",
    "one is a physical localized pole ( green line in fig .",
    "[ polo+ ] ) which corresponds to the bonding state @xmath67 . as the interaction increases",
    ", @xmath68 evolves to a bonding combination between the bonding state of the molecule and the metal , i.e. @xmath69 , becoming more localized and its energy lying well below the fermi level .",
    "the other pole corresponds to a non - physical virtual state which , as the interaction increases , escapes to negative energies and reappears at positive values ( red dots in fig .",
    "[ polo+ ] ) .",
    "as the non - physical pole gets closer to the @xmath70 band , it finally meets the band - edge and suffers a transition into a physical localized state .",
    "this is an antibondig combination between the molecular bonding state and the metal @xmath71 ( blue line ) . in this scenario , bound",
    "weakening occurs because occupying the @xmath69 state implies diminish the occupation of the bonding @xmath72 from 100% into a final 50% .",
    "indeed , the molecular bonding state now has 50% participation in the unoccupied @xmath71 localized orbital that emerged from the upper top of the @xmath1 band .",
    "the previous discussion has a precise equivalence in the analysis of the states that evolve from the molecular antibonding state .",
    "however , the same formulation has now completely different meaning .",
    "the molecular antibonding state interacts with the @xmath1 band through @xmath8 .",
    "the poles resulting from eq .",
    "[ eq - characantibonding ] , are shown in fig .",
    "[ polo- ] . at the antibonding energy @xmath73 ,",
    "two poles appear .",
    "a physical localized state , related to the molecular antibonding state @xmath74 ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ polo- ] ) , whose energy increases as @xmath75 increases and becomes an antibonding combination between the molecular antibonding state and the metal site @xmath76 .",
    "the other pole at @xmath77 is a virtual state @xcite ( red dots in fig .",
    "[ polo- ] ) which diverges as @xmath75 increases and appears again from @xmath78 until its energy touches the @xmath1 band . at this critical value ,",
    "the virtual state suffers a transition and becomes a localized state ( green line in fig .",
    "[ polo- ] ) which is a bonding combination between the molecular antibonding state and the metal band @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , molecular dissociation can be interpreted as occurring at the precise value when the virtual pole touches the @xmath1 band and becomes the localized , and occupied , state@xmath80 .",
    "thus , molecular dissociation occurs at a non - analytical point of the physical observables , e.g. total energies . at this point",
    "the molecular electrons have a transition from an increasingly occupied bonding state that participates of the delocalized band into a localized combination between the @xmath1 states and antibonding molecular orbital .",
    "this is a form of quantum dynamical phase transition which , to the best of our knowledge , has not been identified before in the context of molecular dissociation .    from the results it becomes evident",
    "that the most interesting situation is when the antibonding molecular orbital interacts with the @xmath8 . from eq .",
    "[ e8 ] we get the diagonal green s function at the @xmath8 metallic orbital :    @xmath81    the ldos for the @xmath1 band can be obtained from eq .",
    "[ e11 ] ,    @xmath82 ,   \\label{e12}\\ ] ]    which becomes of great help to reinforce and extend the previous discussion .",
    "this ldos is shown in fig .",
    "[ dens ] for @xmath83 between 0 and 3.6 for @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath85 the shape of the ldos corresponds to a non interacting @xmath8 band . as @xmath86 increases the @xmath8 band starts to mix with the antibonding state of the dimer .",
    "the energy of this antibonding combination @xmath87 , progresses toward increasingly positive values as the interaction grows .",
    "meanwhile , the virtual state approaches the @xmath8 band from negative energies while it produces an attraction  that increases the ldos near the band edge .",
    "as the virtual state meets the band a localized state _ emerges _ from the band edge and gains weight .",
    "a similar issue was recently discussed in the context of engineered plasmonic excitations in metallic nanoparticle arrays @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown analytically that the distorted band is the product among the original semi - elliptic band and a lorentzian centered in the virtual state .",
    "this concentrates a density of states near band edge until it becomes a divergence and a localized state is expelled at a critical interaction strength , shown as a dot in fig .",
    "the previous conclusion is reinforced by the analysis of ldos at the antibonding orbital .",
    "figure [ dens2 ] shows how the unoccupied antibonding state @xmath88 looses its weight towards a participation on combination with the @xmath8 band which finally emerges as an _ occupied localized state_. this is a crucial contribution to molecular destabilization . as in the first part of this work @xcite the new transition",
    "can be seen as a successful implementation of a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite in a well defined model .",
    "notice that figs .",
    "[ dens ]  and [ dens2 ] also serve to discuss the interaction between the bonding molecular state @xmath72 and the @xmath11 band by exchanging the sign of the energy . thus , in this case , the @xmath89 emerges as an unoccupied localized state above the @xmath11 band , while @xmath67 state loses occupation as the @xmath90 state forms with increasing interaction .",
    "as a h@xmath0 molecule approaches a catalyst with its axis parallel to the surface , the interaction creates two independent collective orbitals which are superpositions with different surface @xmath1 orbitals that are part of their corresponding metallic bands .",
    "the molecular bonding state becomes mixed with the @xmath11 band while the molecular antibonding state interacts with the @xmath8 band .",
    "this gives rise to two processes described by the same algebra , but with different physical meanings as their energies are the reverse of each other .",
    "on one side , the mixing of the molecular bonding state produces a decrease of its occupation .",
    "while this occurs , the ldos of the @xmath11 band is distorted at its upper edge much as if it were attracted  upwards .",
    "finally , at a critical interaction strength the divergent peak is expelled as a localized state emerging from the upper ( i.e. unoccupied ) part of the @xmath11 band .",
    "this new _ unoccupied _ state is an antibonding combination among the surface @xmath11 orbital and the _ bonding _ state of the dimer .    on the other side ,",
    "a fraction of the molecular antibonding state gets increasingly mixed with the @xmath8 metallic band .",
    "this produces a decrease of the dimer participation on its unoccupied antibonding combination .",
    "simultaneously , the @xmath8  ldos is attracted  towards its lower edge until it finally emerges as an _ occupied localized state _ build as a bonding combination among the molecular _ antibonding _ state and the @xmath8 band .",
    "these simultaneous mixing processes , i.e. the depopulation of the molecular bonding state and the occupation of the molecular antibonding state , both schematized in fig .",
    "[ figura7 ] , are responsible for the dimer destabilization that leads to its breakdown .",
