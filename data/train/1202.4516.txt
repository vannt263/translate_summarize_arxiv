    "sensitive radio surveys have a key role in cosmology , resting on their ability to detect faint radio sources reaching down to sub - millijansky flux densities and thereby representing a chronicle of the evolution in active galaxies across hubble time .",
    "radio source structures are rich in information : the extended structures serve as indicators of relativistic jet - type activity in agns ; additionally , their morphology is related to the temporal behavior of the jet activity , and the ambient interstellar and intergalactic environment in which they deposit their energy .",
    "agn activity triggered by mergers and the accretion of intergalactic baryons may well be a phase in the lives of most luminous galaxies .",
    "radio galaxies and quasars with extended structures represent circumstances in which there is obvious kinetic mode energetic impact of the agn on the environment and , therefore , radio surveys represent an opportunity for examining the role of such agn feedback on galaxy evolution .    in most sensitive radio surveys",
    "there is often incomplete structural information because of limited surface brightness sensitivity , and consequently the relatively faint and diffuse emission components are often unrepresented . in view of the potential missing structural information on faint radio sources as well as the puzzling paucity of relic radio sources we embarked on a sensitive radio survey that was designed to achieve high radio surface - brightness sensitivity .",
    "the australia telescope low brightness survey ( atlbs ; @xcite ) was made using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.4  ghz adopting an observing strategy that guarantees imaging over a wide field of view with complete spatial frequency coverage ; this ensured the data were not limited by incomplete uv - coverage , dynamic range issues and that the theoretical rms noise sensitivity was achieved .",
    "the atlbs achieved a surface brightness sensitivity that is nearly an order of magnitude lower than previous wide - field surveys .",
    "the atlbs survey was followed up with imaging in multiple array configurations at 1.4  ghz with the aim of obtaining good structural information on the sources .",
    "these data will be presented in @xcite along with a discussion of the source counts .",
    "herein we discuss the radio structures of the atlbs radio sources .",
    "we present an extended atlbs radio source sample ( which we refer to as the atlbs - ess sample ) in which all sources with angular extent larger than about 30 arcsec have been included .",
    "a sensitive survey such as the atlbs that combines high surface brightness sensitivity and angular resolution is expected to reveal a variety of source structures , and provides a sample that reveals the structural variety that is present in the relatively faint radio source population .",
    "we present different classes of radio sources as revealed by the atlbs ; with its rich haul of different structural types , our sample is a valuable resource in the study of the life cycles of radio galaxies .    it is well recognized that flux limited radio surveys include powerful radio sources ( that invariably have fanaroff - riley type - ii morphologies ; @xcite ) to relatively higher redshifts whereas the low power radio sources identified in such surveys are confined to lower redshifts .",
    "the dominance of low power sources in the low redshift population is owing to the slope of the radio luminosity function .",
    "a consequence of this bias in radio surveys is that population studies of low - luminosity sources have been limited to low redshifts with little known of the relative abundance of this dominant group or of their structures at higher redshifts .",
    "a few studies have attempted to extend our knowledge into this space and the general approach has been through radio - optical cross - correlation studies involving deep radio and optical surveys @xcite .",
    "atlbs has achieved relatively high radio surface brightness sensitivity and this is important in detecting the faint extended structures in fr - i radio galaxies . together with excellent imaging of the diffuse structures , we have herein used a more traditional method ( using radio source morphologies ) to extend the fr - i population study to higher redshifts .",
    "a unique and valuable aspect of the atlbs survey is that the sky regions have been observed with excellent surface brightness sensitivity at low resolutions , and the wide survey fields have also been followed up with high resolution radio observations .",
    "reliable measures of integrated flux density provided by the low resolution images along with reliable images of structure at higher angular resolution together yield useful estimates of the truly diffuse emission associated with radio sources .",
    "for example , if at higher resolution there is a clustering of weak compact components and at lower resolution there is detected a source with substantially greater integrated flux density , a good estimate of the associated diffuse emission is possible .",
    "this allows compilation of samples of such radio sources that have substantial associated extended emission components with little compact structure : high resolution interferometer surveys might not only miss the extended emission , but may also misclassify associated compact components as independent sources .",
    "in section  2 we present an overview of the observations followed by the method adopted for the creation of the atlbs - ess .",
    "we devote sections  3 to 4 to a discussion of the relative abundances of different radio source types present in the sample .",
    "this characterization of the morphologies of the faint radio sources is followed by discussion and conclusions in section  5 .",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with hubble constant h@xmath2=71  km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and matter density parameter @xmath4=0.27 .",
    "the atlbs radio images were made at 1388  mhz using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) by mosaic observing 38 adjacent pointing positions covering about 8.4 square degrees of sky area .",
    "the observations were made in a set of array configurations and with sufficiently small dwell time in each pointing position so that the entire survey region is imaged with almost complete visibility coverage up to 750  m. the atlbs images , with beam fwhm of 50  arcsec and with high surface brightness sensitivity , together with associated high resolution data that were simultaneously available on long baselines to the 6-km antenna , provided a measure of the extended emission associated with the radio source population down to about 0.4  mjy flux density @xcite .",
    "important for the present work is the listing provided therein of the integrated flux density in the atlbs sources along with listings of the flux density associated with compact components .",
    "detailed radio structures of the sources detected in the atlbs survey were subsequently imaged by combining the visibilities along with additional data obtained using the atca in a set of extended 6-km array configurations . despite the relatively sparse visibility coverage in the outer realms of the visibility plane ,",
    "the imaging of extended structures was accomplished in a convergent and reliable manner by aiding decovolution in initial self - calibration cycles by restricting the sky area to regions where sources were reliably detected in the high - surface - brightness atlbs images .",
    "the high resolution images of the atlbs survey regions will be presented in @xcite , along with derived source counts .",
    "the synthesized images have a beam of fwhm 6  arcsecs and rms noise of 72  @xmath5jy  beam@xmath3 .",
    "the image quality is excellent in that they have no artifacts apparent above thermal noise .",
    "the survey regions were also imaged in the ks - band using the iris2 imager on the 3.9-m anglo australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the atlbs survey sky area was covered as a mosaic of nearly 700 pointings with median seeing about 1  arcsec .",
    "the field centred at ra : 00h35m00s , dec . :",
    "-67 00 00 ( j2000.0 ; field  a ) was completed barring a few pointings where as the field centred at ra : 00 59 17 , dec . :",
    "-67 00 00 ( j2000.0 ; field  b ) was only partially completed .",
    "a completeness down to 19 mag was achieved .",
    "the ks - band images will be presented in an accompanying manuscript ( johnston et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "in addition to observing in ks - band , the atlbs survey regions were also observed in optical g , r and z band with the mosaicii imager on the ctio noao 4-m blanco telescope .",
    "the larger field of view of 37x37 meant that the two regions could be covered in fewer pointings .",
    "the data reduction of the r - band imaging has been completed and the images have a @xmath6 completeness level to an apparent magnitude of 22.5 .",
    "details of the grz - band optical imaging will be presented in a followup publication ( thorat et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "optical identifications ( i d ) for the atlbs - ess sources were made by examining the r - band images . where there was no identification in r ( either because the area was not covered in the r - band imaging or because there was no object seen at the location of the radio core ) or it was uncertain , we examined the ks band images . in situations where the area was not covered in either r or ks images we used the b and r - band images from the supercosmos sky survey @xcite .",
    "these identifications are based on all the material available and not just the images shown in the paper . in general the process of identifications ultimately involved examination of the vicinity of the centroid of the radio source in all four optical bands ; the information related to this exercise is provided below .",
    "we have an ongoing program for obtaining spectra of the optical identifications for all radio sources in the atlbs fields using the aaomega instrument on the aat . to date 24 sources in the atlbs - ess",
    "have measured redshifts .",
    "herein we give estimates of redshifts for the remaining sources using the derived r - band magnitude vs redshift relationship when spectra are not available ( the details of the methods used for redshift estimates will be given in an accompanying paper : thorat et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we give these estimated redshifts in brackets to distinguish them from measured values .",
    "atlbs images made with the synthesized beam of 50  arcsec were used as the basic resource for compiling the atlbs - ess sample . in the two ,",
    "2-deg mosaic images , only ` islands ' of image pixels with peaks exceeding five times the image rms noise were considered . as described in @xcite , the integrated flux density in compact components within these source islands",
    "were computed from images made with 4-arcsec fwhm beam using exclusively interferometer baselines to the 6  km antenna ( so that extended emission was intentionally filtered out ) .",
    "a first list of candidate sources was created by including only those ` islands ' that had a ratio of integrated flux density to that in compact components larger than or equal to 1.5 .",
    "these sources potentially have extended emission that is more than half the flux density in the compact components .",
    "at relatively higher values for the ratio , selected sources have substantial low surface brightness diffuse emission with little fine structure .",
    "this list was generated by an automated algorithm that scanned the 50 and 4  arcsec images .",
    "it may be noted here that this automated procedure was only applied to the sky regions in the mosaic image that were observed with effective primary beam attenuation within 0.5 , which excluded the outer parts of the images .",
    "the radio structures of the atlbs sources are best represented in 6  arcsec beam fwhm images that were made by @xcite .",
    "separately , these images , including their outer parts , were carefully examined by eye to identify extended radio sources .",
    "this ` second pass ' over the survey regions was aimed at including any additional sources that may have been missed by the automated search algorithm . within the regions scanned by the automated algorithm",
    ", the examination by eye did not yield any additional extended radio sources , giving confidence in the completeness of the selection process .",
    "however in this step we recognized 58 extended radio sources in the outer regions of the atlbs survey and included them as well for the analyses and considerations presented herein .",
    "additionally , examination by eye identified sources that were blended together in the 50  arcsec resolution images : these were thereafter considered as separate sources .",
    "the images with beam fwhm of 6  arcsec were convolved to a final beam of 10  arcsec , and as a final filter only those extended radio sources that were clearly resolved with at least three beams across were retained .",
    "the convolution improved the surface brightness sensitivity of the images , thereby improving the ability to detect diffuse emission .",
    "this criterion corresponds approximately to restricting the atlbs - ess sample to sources with angular size exceeding 30  arcsec .",
    "table  1 presents this sub - sample of extended atlbs sources .",
    "it contains 119 sources and the minimum integrated flux density of sources in this sub - sample is 1  mjy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the table includes information on the radio structural properties based on the examination of the radio images by eye , and estimates of the angular extents ( column  3 ) .",
    "the angular sizes were measured along the maximum extent of the source between the 3-sigma contours in the 10 `` maps .",
    "we also give the total and fractional core flux densities ( column  5 and 6 respectively ) as well as source classification ( column  7 ) .",
    "details of the flux density measurements will be given in @xcite .",
    "in several fr - i sources although cores are the brightest components the fractional core flux densities are upper limits because of blending with surrounding emission . where possible , the radio source position is taken from the position of the r - band optical identification . where the r - band identification is not available or doubtful the coordinates assigned to the radio source is that of the identification in ks - band , or b or r band ; in cases where there is no optical identification available , on the radio core position and in the absence of radio cores we use the radio centroid position from the original 50 '' image",
    ". additionally , the table includes information on the optical identifications , measured r - band magnitudes , measured and inferred redshifts ( given in brackets ) as well as any information on their galaxy environments based on examination of the optical fields .",
    "as the ks band imaging has covered field  b only partially the information on k - band identifications for sources in this field is given only where available .",
    "the images of the 119 atlbs - ess sources are presented in figs 1119 .",
    "the choice of the contours and image resolutions was made with a view to reveal structures of the faint emission regions present in several of the sources .",
    "the remaining extended radio sources that have no recognizable extended structure and are mostly composed of well resolved diffuse emission have not been included in this sub - sample .",
    "these 23 sources are discussed separately in section  4.6 .",
    "there are 11 radio galaxies in the atlbs - ess that have estimated projected linear sizes in excess of 700  kpc and hence are classified as giant radio sources .",
    "nine of these giant radio galaxies are at photometric redshifts @xmath1",
    ". additionally , there are another 3 candidate giant radio sources that have large angular sizes ( exceeding 84  arcsec ) .",
    "these have faint optical hosts and their r - band magnitudes could not be reliably determined ; nevertheless , the faintness of the host galaxy suggests that they are likely to be located at redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "the atlbs - ess giant radio galaxies are listed in table  3 .",

    "herein we present a characterization of the extended radio sources detected in atlbs .",
    "radio sources are large scale manifestations of central nuclear activity and may in some cases exhibit structures that also pre - date that activity",
    ". the variety in radio morphologies may be indicative of basic differences in central engine characteristics and environmental conditions in which they develop ; the structural form may also evolve as the central engine ages and the properties of the beam change .",
    "it is therefore meaningful and insightful to examine the distribution in source structures in radio source populations and over cosmic time , not only from the viewpoint of the gross type  whether the radio morphology is of fr - i or fr - ii type  but also whether the sources may be currently active , inactive or starting a new activity .",
    "sources with fr - i morphology invariably manifest a pair of bright jets or two - sided extensions to the core and lack well defined lobes ; the cores are the brightest components .",
    "fr - ii sources are usually observed to have a pair of distinct edge - brightened lobes with possibly embedded hotspots / warmspots .",
    "jets are often not obvious , unless observed with high dynamic range and sensitivity . in the atlbs - ess sample , some fr - i sources have bright elongated cores , which with higher resolution appear as twin collimated jets on either side of an unresolved core component .",
    "more often the cores have weak , continuous and elongated extensions that hardly resemble classic jets .",
    "a relic double radio source is one in which the beams have ceased .",
    "it is relatively easier to recognize relicts of fr - ii type radio galaxies .",
    "presence of twin edge - brightened lobes that , when observed with high resolution and sensitivity , lack compact hotspots , jets and a core ( or only display a weak core ) , may with some confidence classify the source as a relic fr - ii .",
    "an edge - brightened double source that lacks compact features in the lobes , which nevertheless possesses a bright core , might be classified as a restarting fr - ii radio source .",
    "a double - double morphology is a fairly unambiguous case of a restarted fr - ii radio galaxy .",
    "restarted fr - ii sources may sometimes appear to have the typical edge - brightened hot - spot radio structure with additional remnant low - surface brightness relic emission that is disjoint and outside of the main source ; the relict lobe ( or lobes ) may be collinear with the inner double or sometimes offset in angle .    the appearance of an fr - ii radio source in which the beam power drops substantially",
    "as it approaches the end of activity is not clear : it may be that the beams become lossy and transform to bright fr - i type jets ( which are believed to have intrinsically low beam powers ) : such sources may be recognized by the joint appearance of edge brightened lobes , without hotspots , together with possibly twin bright jets .",
    "since the original fr - i / ii classification scheme was proposed by @xcite , there have been several attempts to refine the criteria for separation of extended radio sources into the two major morphological types @xcite .",
    "@xcite have noted that the morphologies of fr - i types are varied : the bulk of low power radio sources have low luminosity double - lobe type morphologies and only a small percentage ( @xmath8 ) resemble the archetypal source 3c31 .",
    "since we will be referring to the 3c31-type morphology often we give its definition : such a source structure is described as `` naked - jet '' type , where a bright core is accompanied by twin rapidly expanding jets ( e.g. see fig .",
    "the double - lobe type fr - i sources are considered as those in which the jets are light but not powerful enough to end in bright compact hotspots and are affected by surface instabilities and , therefore , may be lossy and bright .",
    "thus a source that has two lobes , a bright core and twin extensions is also to be classified as an fr - i : the lobe - type fr - i .",
    "an unsolved problem is , therefore , whether at least some of the sources considered to be fr - i type may , in fact , be fr - ii sources in which the beams are close to the ends of their activity phase .",
    "the possibility of conversion between the two morphological types , specifically from fr - ii to fr - i type , has been suggested and invoked previously @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is accepted that the central engine in any fr - ii source ( also fr - i ) does switch off and that such beam activity is only a phase in the lives of luminous galaxies . at present",
    "there is no understanding of the manner in which a radio source structure evolves as the central engine turns off , and whether the timescale of the turning off is abrupt or comparable to the active phase .",
    "if the switch off happens over a significant period of time , we may expect to see significant numbers of dying fr - ii sources : perhaps they are the non-3c31 type fr - i sources ?      while the primary separation of atlbs - ess sources into fr - i ( radio sources with bright cores and twin bright large - scale jets or edge - darkened lobes ) and fr - ii sources ( radio sources with twin edge - brightened lobes ) follows the traditional classification scheme of @xcite , we have adopted additional criteria in an attempt to identify sources within relic and restarted sub classes :    fr - ii ( relic ) type : these sources are edge - brightened radio galaxies that lack hotspots , jets and cores .",
    "these sources appear simply as pairs of diffuse edge - brightened lobes .",
    "fr - ii ( restarted ) type : sources of this sub - class have edge - brightened lobes that may or may not have emission peaks at their ends ( _ i.e. _ , which may or may not be relic lobes ) but contain an inner ( recessed ) double source or an elongated radio core or an unusually ( for fr - ii sources ) bright radio core .",
    "fr - i ( relic ) type : these are sources with a core with twin extensions or trails that do not resemble typical jets or lobes .",
    "no other compact emission apart from the core is present .",
    "although the core is often the brightest part of the source the contrast is not high for sources in this sub - class .",
    "fr - i ( restarted ) type : sources of this sub - class are required to have an extended core or a core with a pair of bright , short extensions , which are necessarily accompanied by emission regions further out that are detached from the core and substantially fainter .",
    "membership of this sub - class requires that the outer emission regions are not edge - brightened .    in classifying the radio sources based on the above criteria we have used all the radio data available to us ( the original 50 `` images , the 4 '' images sensitive to compact components and the 6 \" images that give detailed morphologies ) .",
    "of the total of 119 radio sources that comprise the atlbs - ess , 64 ( @xmath9 ) are fr - ii sources and 55 ( @xmath10 ) are fr - i type sources ( the fr - i sources include 18 sources that have wide angle tail ( wat ) structures or head - tail ( ht ) type structures ) .",
    "the atlbs - ess , which has sources down to mjy flux density , has nearly three times larger fraction of fr - i sources compared to the well - known 3crr sample , which has a much greater flux density cutoff .",
    "a large fraction ( @xmath11 ) of the sample has firm identifications . in 20 fr - ii sources , either radio cores are not obvious (",
    "although a candidate host galaxy is identified in 6 ) or optical identifications have not been possible ( although a core component is present in 4 ) or the best optical candidate was chosen with the available data .",
    "five of the 55 fr - i sources have no optical counterparts identified although cores are clearly observed .    a large fraction of the fr - i population ( not including wat , ht types ) is of the asymmetric type where a core is accompanied by a pair of lobes that appear to extend to different distances on the sky .",
    "the ratio of lobe lengths on the two sides exceeds 1.5 in @xmath12 ( 12/37 ) of the sources ( figs . 5 , 18 , 30 , 31 , 42 , 55 , 76 , 90 , 92 , 94 , 107 , 111 ) . even if two of the sources 01 03 10.03 -66 32 21.5 and 01 06 01.90 -66 53 37.26 ( figs .",
    "94 , 107 ) may not meet the las criterion ( see table  1 ) and hence are excluded , close to a third of the fr - i sources have more than @xmath13 difference in the lobe extents on the two sides ; therefore , significant asymmetry appears to be a common occurrence in the atlbs fr - i sources .",
    "additionally , the fr - i sources in atlbs - ess are mostly of the 3c31-type and not of the double - lobe type structure that dominates samples with relatively higher flux density cutoffs .",
    "morphological differences and flux asymmetries are quite prevalent in these strongly asymmetric fr - i sources , occurring in nearly half of them .",
    "all five asymmetric fr - i sources ( figs . 18 , 31 , 55 , 76 , 92 ) that have pronounced flux asymmetries also have substantial morphological asymmetry .",
    "sources with the greatest asymmetry in lobe extents do not necessarily have the greatest asymmetry in flux density ; however , one of the most asymmetric fr - i sources ( fig . 92 ) does indeed have the greatest asymmetry in flux density .",
    "in contrast to these morphological characteristics of fr - i sources , a significantly smaller fraction of fr - ii sources display such pronounced asymmetry in lobe extents . if we omit from consideration those ten fr - ii sources that have no radio core and no obvious optical ids ( because lack of a core or clear i d in fr - ii sources results in ambiguity as regards the location of the center in contrast to the case of fr - i sources where bright cores makes knowledge of the position of an optical i d less necessary ) , and those where the total extent is unclear ( owing to confusion as to whether outlying components are independent sources or extensions ) , 7/54 sources or @xmath14 alone display pronounced asymmetry in which the ratio of extents exceeds 1.5 ( figs .",
    "23 , 26 , 49 , 59 , 84 , 87 , 110 ) .",
    "the lobe - extent asymmetry in these fr - ii sources appears to be frequently accompanied by asymmetries in flux density but less often by asymmetries in morphologies .      as mentioned in the introduction little",
    "is known of the low power radio galaxy population at higher redshifts because imaging their low brightness structures required highly sensitive radio surveys .",
    "the high surface brightness sensitivity achieved in the atlbs has the potential to detect and identify the radio morphologies of low power radio galaxies at relatively high redshifts , besides the high redshift powerful extended radio sources . in table  1",
    "we have indicated the 22 fr - i type radio sources from the atlbs - ess that are estimated to have redshifts @xmath15 . in this section",
    "we have attempted to characterize their radio structures and make a comparison with the structures of the remaining , lower redshift ( @xmath16 ) fr - i sources .    for three of these fr - i sources",
    "we have spectroscopically measured redshifts : two have broad emission lines and hence classify as fr - i quasars .",
    "seven sources have optical hosts that are either very faint in the r - band images or are not seen in these images .",
    "these sources are likely to have redshifts @xmath17 exceeding 0.5 . in the case of 00 57 11.76 -66 33 38.7 ( fig .",
    "75 ) , it was not possible to obtain the magnitude of the host galaxy in either r - band ( due to an image artifact at the source location ) or k - band ( because of contamination from a bright star in the vicinity ) . in this case",
    "we used the fr - i / ii break power to estimate the redshift using the measured total flux density of the source and the assumption that this break power does not evolve with redshift . using the upper limit to the total 1.4  ghz powers of fr - i sources",
    " the break power of @xmath18  w  hz@xmath3we use the total flux density of the fr - i source , 5.69  mjy , and derive an upper limit of @xmath19 to the redshift .",
    "five of the 22 fr - i sources are of wat or probably wat - type structures .",
    "the remainder of high redshift fr - i sources have predominantly 3c31 type morphologies ( 14/17 ) with only 3 having lobe - type morphologies .",
    "the low redshift fr - i population in the atlbs - ess sample ( excepting those with wat / ht type and one with hybrid structure ) has a similarly low fraction ( 3/19 ) of lobe - type morphologies .",
    "in contrast to the findings of @xcite , whose use the much brighter b2 sample , where only a small percentage ( @xmath8 ) of fr - i sources are of the type resembling the archetypal source 3c31 , the atlbs survey finds substantially larger fractions of 3c31-type sources .",
    "more than a fourth ( 6/22 ) of the high redshift fr - i sources are of core - twin - jet type that appear to have the brightest cores in the entire sample of atlbs - ess sources . in these the extensions are weak or ill - formed with most of the source dominated by the bright core .",
    "the fractional abundance of this source type at @xmath16 is smaller ( 3/33 ) .",
    "the low and high redshift fr - i sources do not display differences in the incidence of pronounced asymmetry in lobe extents .",
    "if we omit the wat and ht sources from consideration , of the 12 fr - i sources that have lobe extents differing by more than @xmath13 , 7/19 are at @xmath16 and 5/17 are at @xmath0 .    because of the edge - darkened nature of fr - i sources in which the lobe surface brightness progressively diminishes with distance from the core , it is more meaningful to examine the structures of fr - is with relatively larger angular size to identify relic and restarted radio sources .",
    "we examined sources with angular size @xmath20  arcmin , which ensured well resolved images from the atlbs observations .",
    "there are 4 sources that are identified as being at high redshift ( @xmath15 ) and 11 that are identified as being at low redshift ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "while @xmath22 ( 4/22 ) of high redshift fr - is have angular sizes larger than or equal to an arc - minute nearly double that fraction ( @xmath23 , 11/33 ) is seen to have these large angular sizes in the low redshift fr - i population .",
    "two of the 11 low redshift fr - i sources are wat type ; of the remaining nine @xmath21 fr - i sources , two are recognized as having restarted nuclear activity ( figs . 5 and 30 ) . among the four @xmath24 fr - i sources with las @xmath20  arcmin ,",
    "one is recognized as potentially having a restarted activity ( fig .",
    "90 ) and another as a source in which the nuclear activity has ceased ( fig .",
    "31 ) . for these small sub - samples derived from the atlbs - ess",
    ", there is no evidence for a difference in the incidence of restarted and relic fr - i sources at redshifts below and above @xmath25 .    in summary",
    ", we have attempted to compare the morphologies of low and high redshift fr - i sources using the atlbs - ess .",
    "there appear to be no major differences in morphological properties of the high and low redshift samples of fr - i sources ; in their asymmetry properties as well as the fractions with structures corresponding to relic or restarted sources .",
    "there is , however , indication that there is a higher abundance of fr - i sources with a bright - core and twin weak jets at higher redshifts .",
    "sources in which the core is weak or absent and no hotspots or jets are seen are candidates for relics . however , as mentioned earlier , if the central activity ceases gradually rather than abruptly , there may be fr - ii sources observed that are close to the end of their lifetime and at a time when the lobes are devoid of hotspots , the central region has a core and twin , lossy , bright jets , the lobe has suffered substantial entrainment and may be buoyantly displaced by the ambient medium . such sources might be mistaken for an fr - i or even a restarted fr - ii . on the other hand , a relic fr",
    "- i may continue to be centrally brightened as a consequence of weakening of the peripheral parts of the lobes as the energy injection ceases and brightening at the center as weakened jets become increasingly lossy .",
    "based on the definitions adopted in section  3.2 for relic fr - i radio sources , we have recognized two sources as being relic fr - is : j0035.1 - 6748 ( fig .",
    "31 ) , and possibly j0043.6 - 6624 ( fig .",
    "50 ) . in j0035.1 - 6748",
    ", there is no compact emission ( even at the core ) .",
    "the source j0043.6 - 6624 is a wat - type relic fr - i in which a weak core appears disjoint from the two extensions . in j0035.1 - 6748 ,",
    "the central extended emission component is associated with a faint galaxy and to the south is a faint extended feature .",
    "there is no compact emission seen at 4 `` resolution . when smoothed to 10 ''",
    "resolution a much larger source emerges particularly to the north where a faint extension is seen extending nearly twice the extent of the feature to the south .",
    "the bright source at the centre accompanied by weaker extensions together with the lack of any core or jets at the resolution of 4 \" are characteristics that suggest the source to be a relic fr - i .    as for relic fr - ii",
    "radio sources , only one source j0102.1 - 6552 ( fig .  86 ) qualifies the definition ; however , we also note j0043.4 - 6738 ( fig .",
    "49 ) as a possible relic fr - ii candidate .",
    "the first source has no core and no obvious hotspot at the ends of the lobes .",
    "the second candidate has a weak compact source ( at 4 `` , contours not shown in the figure ) between the two lobe components but its identification as the radio core is uncertain because it is located off the radio axis ( about 3 arcsec west ) .",
    "moreover , although there is an extended emission peak in the southern lobe ( also at 4 '' , contours not shown ) it is not at the end of the lobe as is expected in an archetypal fr - ii source . in both sources",
    "the lobes have relatively small axial ratios as is expected for evolved relic lobes",
    ".    most sources manifest central cores , jets , or hotspots that are key indicators of continuing agn activity .",
    "however the sample of atlbs - ess relics have been selected on the basis that they lack most of these components . the poor abundance of relic radio sources even in a survey such as the atlbs that has exceptional surface brightness sensitivity adds weight to the well - known rarity of relic sources @xcite .",
    "it may be noted here that the identification of relic sources has been done herein solely on the basis of radio morphology and without considering additional indicators such as the spectral index @xcite .    to gauge the relative effectiveness of our survey in identifying relic radio sources",
    ", we compared the atlbs images with the only other comparable radio survey for the survey region : the 843  mhz sumss @xcite .",
    "the atlbs sources were identified from images with beam fwhm 50  arcsec , which is very similar to the resolution in sumss .",
    "the observing frequencies of the two surveys are not too far apart , although the image rms noise in sumss is more than 10 times higher than that in atlbs . of the 4 relic sources that have potentially been identified in atlbs , one ( j0035.1 - 6748 ; fig .",
    "31 ) is not detected in sumss whereas it is detected at the 14@xmath26 level in the atlbs .",
    "the remaining relic sources are detected in sumss ; however , they are observed with peak brightness of 3 - 5 times rms noise where as in the atlbs images they are detected at 25 - 100 times the rms noise in the atlbs .",
    "their angular extents in the sumss image are in most cases significantly smaller than their angular sizes in the atlbs .",
    "the atlbs has , therefore , clear advantages in sensitivity to detecting relic radio sources .",
    "the fr - i and fr - ii relics in our survey are not among the sources with the lowest surface brightness .",
    "only j0035.1 - 6748 , which is the fr - i relic source , has a low surface brightness of 3.5  mjy  arcmin@xmath27 .",
    "both the fr - i relic sources are at redshift @xmath0 .      admittedly ,",
    "identification of relic or restarted activity amongst the lower - power fr - i radio sources may often be ambiguous .",
    "the properties of the ambient gas and the time elapsed since the cessation of beam activity are some of the factors that influence the appearance of remnant synchrotron plasma .",
    "it is interesting to compare methods for recognizing sources that are in the restarting phase among fr - i and fr - ii types . in both types recognizing a source to",
    "be restarting hinges on recognizing relic features ; however , a problem specific to fr - i sources is that the lobes fade with distance from the core and this makes it difficult to cleanly separate renewed activity from past activity especially if the source is not well resolved .",
    "the likelihood of detecting relic emission is greater if the host galaxy resides in a dense cluster medium that may ram pressure limit expansion losses .",
    "an example of such a circumstance may be in the source j0024.4 - 6636 ( fig .",
    "it has a central core with twin extensions that are accompanied by weak , diffuse emission regions farther out that are asymmetrically located with respect to the central source .",
    "the host is in a rich cluster .",
    "the western outer lobe appears to be experiencing intracluster gas weather : it is relatively brighter , closer to the core and also appears to be offset from the source axis where there is a concentration of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "the outer lobes of this source may be in a transition state fading to become radio - ghosts .",
    "the components needed to classify an fr - i source as restarting are an active core together with outer extensions that represent older activity .",
    "morphological signature of an active core is a compact central source accompanied by twin jets ; at lower resolution the renewed activity may appear as an elongated source or simply a bright core with a relatively steep spectral index .",
    "evidence for relict fr - i type activity may be in the form of substantially weaker extensions ( single or twin ) that take the form of broad ( non edge - brightened ) emission regions that may be detached from the core . based on the criteria in section  3.2",

    "three are likely to be at redshifts exceeding 0.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "21 atlbs - ess sources are recognized as candidate restarted fr - ii sources .",
    "they have the following defining characteristics : an edge - brightened lobe morphology ( with or without hotspots ) accompanied by a central bright , extended core or an inner - double source straddling the core .",
    "we also include sources where only one relic lobe is observed along the radio axis . in table  1 the candidate restarted sources have been indicated .    in all ,",

    "it may be cautioned here that these estimates are tentative in the light of above mentioned difficulties with reliable recognition of restarting especially in the case of fr - i sources .",
    "at least 11 of the 21 restarted fr - ii sources are estimated to have redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "the radio sources identified as restarted radio galaxies exhibit non - classic fr - i and fr - ii morphologies . for the larger sample of restarted fr - ii radio sources we have compiled the following characteristics : the average fractional core flux density is 0.17 which is more than twice the value for normal fr - ii sources in the ess ( including seven upperlimits and excluding the 2 relics ) and twice below the value for normal ess fr - is ( that excludes relics , restarts and the hybrid morphology source ) . excluding the two quasars among the restarted fr - iis does not change the fractional core flux density .",
    "also if we exclude the 9 fr - is with fractional core flux densities above 0.5 ( to exclude possible quasars ) the value still remains high at 0.27 for the fr - is .",
    "although this value is likely to be lower because several fr - i cores are blended with surrounding jet emission , the restarted fr - iis appear to have rather high fractional core flux densities , intermediate between fr - iis and fr - is .",
    "also as many as 10 of the 21 have at least one relic radio lobe and 4 out of the 5 with the most prominent cores have at least one relic lobe .",
    "the 7 sources that have either an inner double or extensions to the core have an average fractional core power of 0.09 .",
    "only 5 out of 19 ( excluding the two quasars ) have lobe pairs with hotspots in them three of which also have an inner double . for the 8 restarted fr - ii sources whose classification hinges on having bright cores in association with edge - brightened lobes",
    "the average linear size is 606  kpc which is larger than the average linear size ( 514  kpc ) for the 25 normal fr - iis for which sizes could be estimated .",
    "hence projection - related effects may not be playing a significant role in boosting the core flux density .",
    "four of the seven restarting fr - i sources appear to have pronounced asymmetry in lobe extents ; in these the lobe extent on one side is more than one and a half times the extent on the opposite side .",
    "in contrast , only 3 of the 20 restarted fr - ii sources ( figs .",
    "23 , 26 , 84 ) show pronounced side - to - side asymmetry in lobe extents ( with ratio @xmath29 ) .",

    "given its angular size ( 102 arcsec ) , its redshift ( z=1.156 ) and morphology , the source is a restarted , 845  kpc giant radio quasar .",

    "j0031.1 - 6642 as well as j0031.8 - 6727 , the distant tail - like faint emission that is plausibly a relict lobe is on the side of the shorter lobe .",
    "the latter source has an optical host that appears star - like and has broad emission lines : this is an fr - ii quasar and , therefore , the jet axis is likely inclined at a large angle to the sky plane .",
    "if we assume that the side - to - side asymmetry is owing to light travel time effects and consequently the shorter lobe is on the far side , the one - sided appearance of the relict emission may also arise from light travel time effects in which the relict emission on the near side , which is being observed at a later time , has faded from view where as the lobe on the far side continues to be above the detection threshold .",
    "such a possibility allows an estimate of the time over which a lobe may fade as a result of expansion losses .",
    "alternately , it may be that the ambient gas density is greater on the side of the shorter lobe and that causes the jet advance speed on that side to be lower and also ram - pressure impedes the expansion loss in the relict lobe on the same side . in the case of j0031.1 - 6642 , the optical host is once again star - like and the two close - in lobes appear compact with little diffuse structure ; the phenomenology in this case may be the same .",
    "however , it may be noted that neither source shows a jet on the side of the more distant lobe , which is expected owing to beaming effects if light - travel - time is responsible for the observed asymmetries .",

    "we find a large number of relatively high - redshift fr - i sources .",
    "these 22 high - redshift fr - i sources form an important database for examining evolution of low power sources because of their robust radio morphological classification unlike previous attempts .",
    "the properties of the low and high redshift fr - i sources have been compared .",
    "there appear to be no major differences in morphological properties of the high and low redshift samples of fr - i sources .",
    "we identify as many as 14 of the atlbs - ess radio sources to be giants with projected linear size exceeding 700 kpc ; at least 9 of them are likely to be at redshifts exceeding unity . based on the 7c survey",
    ", @xcite revealed the prevalence of giant radio sources out to redshift of unity .",
    "compared to the 7c survey , the atlbs - ess has relatively higher sensitivity over smaller sky area , and the substantial number of high redshift giants detected in atlbs - ess reveals that giant radio sources are not less common at redshifts exceeding unity .",
    "the giant sources detected in the atlbs - ess have similar radio powers compared to the 7c giants .",
    "we consider herein a model in which the lifetime of an extended radio galaxy consists of ( i ) an active phase in which the source extent dynamically grows over time , ( ii ) a dying phase in which the central engine has switched off and the beams cease feeding the lobes , and ( iii ) a restarting phase in which new activity is seen along with relict lobes created in the previous activity phase .",
    "the fraction of fr - is and fr - iis where there are no signatures of on - going nuclear activity remains small , about @xmath36 : consistent with the reported rarity of dead radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the finding indicates that even in surveys like the atlbs in which the surface brightness sensitivity has been substantially improved , a significantly larger number of relict radio sources are not detected .",
    "this indicates that the relict or dying phase is short , independent of the survey sensitivity , and perhaps ended by a restarting of the central engine .",
    "this last phase ends when the relict lobes are no longer distinctly discernible either because they have faded away owing to losses arising from their emissivity or expansion , or because the new beams have rejuvenated the entire relict lobes .",
    "a new finding of the atlbs - ess is that observed morphology of a large number of fr - i and fr - ii radio galaxies may suggest signatures of restarted nuclear activity .",
    "nearly one - third of fr - iis have `` non - classic '' morphologies that are more easily associated with a renewed beam activity ; in contrast , only one - eighth of the atlbs - ess fr - is show signatures of restarted activity . in the model",
    "considered above , it appears that fr - ii sources may spend two - thirds of their lifetime in the active phase , one - thirds in the restarting phase , and only a few percent in the dying phase . in the case of fr - i sources",
    ", the active phase may be larger and the restarting phase correspondingly smaller .",
    "we speculate that such episodic activity may continue over multiple cycles during which the source never disappears from radio surveys , following which the entire episodic activity may cease and the host reverts to a radio - quiet state .",
    "these cycles of episodic activity may perhaps be the time during which the source grows and total duration of these activity phases represents the dynamical age of the source . in this scenario , since the active phase is the dominant duration , the dynamical age is close to the true age and spectral ages may be confusing owing to the episodic activity .",
    "we have listed the few radio sources that are observed to have faint , elongated emission regions on one side that are aligned with but separated from the radio galaxy .",
    "these are likely to be radio galaxies that have had a previous epoch of activity .",
    "we point out that we may be seeing old emission regions that are preserved in a relatively dense ambient medium on one side ; alternately , light travel time effects may be enabling the old lobe on the side pointing away from us to be visible ( j0031.1 - 6642 and j0031.8 - 6727 ) .",
    "the atlbs has detected among the faintest radio sources known .",
    "the giant radio galaxy j0034.0 - 6639 has lobes that have the lowest surface brightness known . in imaging the faintest relict radio lobes identified in the atlbs - ess , which includes this giant radio galaxy and also the aligned but separated faint tail in the large quasar j0031.1 - 6642",
    ", the survey has shown that relict lobes may continue to maintain their symmetry about the radio axis .",
    "this is in contrast to the case in radio sources at centers of galaxy clusters , and is consistent with the expectation that extended radio sources in the intergalactic gas away from cluster environments experience relatively benign weather .",
    "the discussion presented here of the structures in radio galaxies imaged in one of the most sensitive radio surveys is of considerable relevance in the view of the upcoming sensitive , all - sky radio surveys with instruments such as lofar and askap . by focusing on the larger of the radio sources",
    "imaged in the atlbs - ess we have sought to highlight the variety of source structures and science that may be anticipated .",
    "atca is part of the australia telescope , which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "cerro tololo inter - american observatory , national optical astronomy observatory , is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , under contract with the national science foundation .",
