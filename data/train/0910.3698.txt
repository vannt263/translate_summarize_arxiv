    "<S> it has been suggested that dark matter particles which scatter inelastically from detector target nuclei could explain the apparent incompatibility of the dama modulation signal ( interpreted as evidence for particle dark matter ) with the null results from cdms - ii and xenon10 . among the predictions of inelastically interacting dark matter </S>",
    "<S> are a suppression of low - energy events , and a population of nuclear recoil events at higher nuclear recoil equivalent energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast to the well - known expectation of a falling exponential spectrum for the case of elastic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new analysis of xenon10 dark matter search data extending to e@xmath0  kev nuclear recoil equivalent energy . </S>",
    "<S> our results exclude a significant region of previously allowed parameter space in the model of inelastically interacting dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is found that dark matter particle masses @xmath1  gev are disfavored . </S>"
