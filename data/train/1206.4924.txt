    "with the purpose of better understanding the dynamics of core - collapse supernova and the observed characteristics of neutron stars , a considerable theoretical effort has been undertaken in recent years concerning the modelization of the equation of state of cold dense matter @xcite with some extensions to finite temperature , see e.g. @xcite .    if it is well admitted that hyperonic and deconfined quark matter could exist in the inner core of neutron stars , a complete understanding of the composition and equation of state of dense matter is far from being achieved .",
    "concerning hyperons , simple energetic considerations suggest that they should be present at high density @xcite .",
    "however , in the standard picture the opening of hyperon degrees of freedom leads to a considerable softening of the equation of state @xcite , which in turns leads to maximum neutron star masses smaller than the highest values obtained in recent observations @xcite .",
    "this puzzling situation implies that the hyperon - hyperon and hyperon - nucleon couplings must be much more repulsive at high density than presently assumed @xcite , and/or that something is missing in the present modelization .",
    "apart from neutron star observations , already for purely nuclear matter , stringent constraints on the equation of state from experimental data as well as from theoretical side from ab - initio calculations only exist up to roughly saturation density , mainly for almost symmetric matter at zero temperature .",
    "what makes the description of hyperonic matter even more difficult is first of all the fact that , contrary to nucleons , hyperonic data from hypernuclei ( see e.g. @xcite ) , diffusion and production experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) and nuclear collision experiments ( see e.g. @xcite ) are scarce .",
    "this lack of experimental information induces large uncertainties within the microscopic approaches @xcite , which suffer in addition probably from theoretical shortcomings , among others due to the unknown hyperonic three - body forces @xcite .",
    "phenomenological extrapolations of the low - density behavior within mean field models are subject to large uncertainties , too . in any case",
    ", there is much uncertainty on the hyperonic interactions at high density , where neutron star observations can give the only hint , though not decisive .    here",
    ", we propose to study the phase diagram of hyperonic matter .",
    "the generic presence of attractive and repulsive couplings suggests the existence , in a model - independent manner , of a phase transition involving strangeness . in order to have an analytically solvable model",
    ", we consider the simplified situation where only neutrons , @xmath1 , and @xmath0-hyperons are allowed in the matter chemical composition .",
    "we find , as argued above , a first order phase transition involving strangeness .",
    "in addition , we will show under which assumptions on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 interaction , respecting the available constraints , a phase transition towards strange matter , that is with a discontinuity in the strangeness content of matter , exists at high density .",
    "we leave the inclusion of protons and higher mass strange and non - strange baryons to a future study . because of this simplification",
    ", we will not be able to exploit the results for a predictive quantitative application to neutron stars and dense supernova matter .",
    "however , this simplification will allow us to have an exactly solvable model with perfectly controlled numerics .",
    "we believe that the relevant degrees of freedom to explore the opening of the strangeness channels are included already at this level , and the qualitative features of the strangeness phase transition will not change in the complete model .",
    "concerning the phenomenological consequences of our findings let us stress that many published work on hyperonic matter makes use of the mean field approximation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the opening of the strangeness degree of freedom at high baryonic density is associated with a first order phase transition , the mean field equations of state should be modified making use of the gibbs construction @xcite.the possible presence of coexisting phases would in addition modify the matter composition with respect to the uncorrected mean - field predictions @xcite .    both , matter composition and equation of state , are important ingredients not only in the calculations of neutrons star models , but in the hydrodynamical codes describing core collapse dynamics , too .",
    "the high density and high temperature behavior not only influences the success of the explosion , but among others also the dependence of the final state ( neutron star or black hole ) on the progenitor mass ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the possible presence of a phase transition towards strange matter has to be studied at finite temperature , too .",
    "in the following we will illustrate the propositions concerning the phase diagram by choosing a specific interaction model for the @xmath3 system .",
    "of course , the quantitative numerical results are not model - independent , but we will argue in which way our findings on the phase diagram are general .",
    "the energetics of the @xmath3 mixture is described through the energy density functional proposed by balberg and gal @xcite @xmath4 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ a_{\\lambda\\lambda}\\rho_\\lambda^2 + c_{\\lambda\\lambda}\\rho_\\lambda^{\\gamma+1}\\right ] \\\\",

    "the finding in this region thus seems qualitatively robust .",
    "the existence of a strangeness phase transition at high density , on the contrary , is not a general model - independent feature , although , as mentioned above , many models show it .",
    "there are others , for instance the g - matrix models of refs .",

    "this can be seen from the absence of a minimum in @xmath23 as a function of @xmath32 for constant @xmath42 .",
    "the reason is twofold : first , a @xmath2 interaction is completely missing from these models and the @xmath3-interaction has a slightly different form than in balberg and gal @xcite .",
    "owing to the lack of reliable information on the hyperonic interactions , which would discriminate between different models , we can not affirm the existence of the strangeness phase transition , related to this instability , but , turning the argument around , the presence of this phase transition in a physical system would allow to learn much about the shape of the interaction .",
    "one remark of caution concerning the relation of the instability domain with a phase transition is in order here . in principle , the presence of an instability is a pathology of mean - field approaches . it is an indication that the lowest energy ( or free - energy at finite temperature ) equilibrium solution is different from the unstable mean - field one . if the equilibrium solution corresponds to macroscopic dishomogeneities , it can and it should be recovered from the mean - field results making use of the gibbs construction . in this case",
    "the convexity in the curvature matrix reflects a physical instability towards phase separation , and the phase diagram contains a region of phase coexistence .",
    "however , since the mean - field equations of state are by construction analytic infinitely differentiable functions , it is possible that the instability is due to a multiple evaluation of densities in a given point of the phase diagram defined by the set of associated chemical potentials , too",
    ". this may not be pertinent in our simple model allowing only two different particle species , but might very well occur in a more complete model including all hyperons and resonance states @xcite . in this case",
    "the unstable solution has to be eliminated from the equilibrium landscape , without necessarily any phase transition .    to discriminate between the two scenarii and correct the mean - field instabilities , one has therefore to study the phase diagram in the space of chemical potentials .",
    "a useful trick to spot for phase transitions with more than one conserved charge , is to perform a legendre transform to the statistical ensemble where all extensive variables but one are replaced by their conjugated intensive lagrange parameters @xcite . in this ensemble",
    "the multidimensional gibbs equilibrium conditions reduce to a simple maxwell construction .    in our simple two - dimensional case",
    "we can work equivalently within the ensemble where the neutron density is controlled , or , alternatively , within the ensemble where the @xmath0-density is controlled , corresponding to the two constrained energies : @xmath47 let us concentrate on the second representation .",

    "[ fig : mul_rhol_zoom ] ) having the same first - order derivative , that is the same chemical potential .",
    "since these two points have the same value for all the intensive variables ( @xmath53 ) , they respect gibbs equilibrium rules .",
    "one can therefore see that the ensemble of maxwell constructions in the @xmath54 ensemble is equivalent to the construction of the global convex envelope of the energy , that is to the gibbs construction of the complete system .    in the high density case ( right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : mul_rhol_zoom ] ) , the elimination of the multiple evaluation leaves a monotonous equation of state , which does not allow any energy gain by linear interpolations .",

    "if we follow the physical path @xmath50 associated to equilibrium of strangeness ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : coex_contoursmun ] ) , the emergence of strangeness with the opening of the hyperon channel corresponds to the mixed - phase region of a first order phase transition , which is not correctly modeled in the mean - field approximation .    up to now",

    "[ fig : mul_rhol ] are observed , with the difference that at finite temperature chemical potentials tend to @xmath62 with vanishing density . as a consequence ,",

    "[ fig : coex_t ] .",
    "this phase diagram exhibits different interesting features .",
    "we can see that the three regions that we have tentatively defined at zero temperature appear as distinct phase transitions at finite temperature . the first phase transition ( zone ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : coex_t ] ) separates a low density gas phase from a high density more symmetric liquid phase , very similar to ordinary liquid - gas . the second one ( zone iii in fig .",
    "[ fig : coex_t ] ) reflects the instability of dense strange matter towards the appearance of neutrons and has an almost symmetric counterpart ( zone i in fig .",
    "[ fig : coex_t ] ) in the instability of dense neutron matter towards the formation of @xmath0-hyperons .",
    "up to a certain temperature , this latter phase transition is explored by the @xmath50 trajectory , meaning that it is expected to occur in neutron stars and supernova matter . at variance with other known phase transitions in nuclear matter ,",
    "this transition exists at any temperature and is not limited in density ; it is always associated ( except at @xmath63 mev in the present model ) with a critical point , which moves towards high density as the temperature increases .",
    "this means that criticality should be observed in hot supernova matter , at a temperature which is estimated as @xmath64 mev in the present schematic model .",
    "the consequences of these findings for the composition of neutron star matter are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambdas ] .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath0 fraction @xmath65 as a function of the baryon density under the condition @xmath50 .",
    "the crossing of the mixed - phase region with increasing neutron density implies that , as soon as the lower density transition border is crossed , the system has to be viewed as a dishomogeneous mixture of macroscopic regions composed essentially of neutrons , with other macroscopic regions with around @xmath66 of hyperons .",

    "[ fig : coex_t ] , that the critical point of the strangeness phase transition moves to higher density , crossing the physical line @xmath67 at a given temperature , @xmath68 mev in the present example .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the phase diagram of an interacting system of neutrons and @xmath0-hyperons in the mean field approximation .",
    "we have shown that this simple system presents a complex phase diagram with first and second order phase transitions .",
    "some of these phase transitions are probably never explored in physical systems .",
    "however , a possible phase transition at super - saturation baryon densities , from non - strange to strange matter is expected to be observed both in the inner core of neutron star and in the dense regions of core - collapse supernova . for this latter phenomenology , a critical point",
    "is predicted and the associated critical opalescence could have an impact on supernova dynamics @xcite .",
    "the existence of this particular phase transition can be related to the form of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 interaction and is , in the present model , essentially due to the presence of an attractive low density @xmath2 interaction as well as to the high - density part of the @xmath3-interaction . as such",
    ", it is expected to persist in a realistic model of dense matter including more hyperonic and non - hyperonic baryons .",
    "the immediate consequence of that is that the opening of hyperon channels at high density should not be viewed as a continuous ( though abrupt ) increase of strangeness in the matter , observed in many models of hyperonic matter , cf e.g. @xcite , but rather as the coexistence of hyperon - poor and hyperon - rich macroscopic domains .",
    "different steps have however to be achieved before quantitative predictions on neutron star physics can be drawn from this simple model .",
