    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of an electron , a relativistic quantum effect , results in various exotic phenomena and has recently opened up new frontiers in solid state physics .",
    "apart from the phenomena related to surface science , such as the rashba and quantum spin hall effects  @xcite , there are some cases in which soc plays a predominant role in the bulk nature of condensed matter . among them , ruddlesden - popper - type iridium oxides ( rp - iridates ) sr@xmath1ir@xmath2o@xmath3 offer an excellent opportunity for studying the interplay between the soc and electron correlation effects in the bulk material , since the strength of the electron correlation changes together with the dimensionality of the iro@xmath4-plane structure depending on the number @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional layered sr@xmath4iro@xmath13 ( @xmath12=1 ; sr214 ) , which contains an isolated single iro@xmath4 plane , has the strongly spin - orbit - coupled @xmath14=1/2 state , in which ir @xmath15 levels are partially occupied by electrons ( where @xmath14 stands for the _ resultant _ effective total angular momentum )  @xcite . following are some salient features of this state :",
    "( 1 ) the soc in the ir 5@xmath16 electrons has an energy scale comparable to that of hopping integrals of 5@xmath16 electrons and the @xmath16-@xmath16 coulomb interaction because of the large atomic number @xmath17 ( = 77 ) .",
    "this leads to a significant splitting of ir @xmath15 @xmath18 levels .",
    "the five 5@xmath16 electrons occupy the upper @xmath5=1/2 and lower @xmath5=3/2 states ( where @xmath5 stands for the _ one - electron _ effective total angular momentum ) .",
    "the @xmath5 states are represented as linear combinations of atomic @xmath18 orbitals with a mixture of up and down 5@xmath16 electron spins ; ( 2 ) the half - filled @xmath5=1/2 band , which plays an important role in the unique nature of sr214 , further splits into two bands across the fermi energy ( @xmath19 ) because of antiferromagnetic and @xmath16-@xmath16 coulomb interactions , whereas the @xmath5=3/2 bands are fully occupied and lie below @xmath19 .",
    "the presence of the half - filled insulating band ( the so - called lower hubbard band ) indicates that sr214 is a promising candidate for the parent material of high-@xmath20 superconductors , in analogy with la@xmath4cuo@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the final member of the system , sriro@xmath8 ( @xmath12=@xmath21 ; sr113 ) shows metallic behavior above @xmath22150  k  @xcite .",
    "sr113 is now attracting much attention because a bulk semi - metallic ground state with a new topological phase has been proposed on the basis of several theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the semi - metallic behavior of the hall coefficient and possible dirac - like linear dispersions in the electronic structures projected onto the 2d momentum ( or wave number @xmath11 ) space were reported  @xcite . between sr214 and sr113",
    ", an insulator - to - metal transition occurs with increasing dimensionality .",
    "the antiferromagnetic insulator sr@xmath8ir@xmath4o@xmath10 ( @xmath12=2 ; sr327 ) is located close to the border of the transition  @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we integrate the evolution of 3d electronic structures with the dimensionality of the iro@xmath4-plane structure , and the synergy effects that occur between the soc and electron correlations in @xmath14 ground states in the rp - iridates sr214 , sr327 , and sr113 .",
    "to address these issues , we use angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) with brilliant soft - x - ray ( sx ) synchrotron radiation . in the sx region ,",
    "photoemission spectroscopy is suited to the investigation of electronic structures in the bulk owing to the large probing depth  @xcite .",
    "there are two more benefits in using sx - arpes for studying ir @xmath5 states : ( 1 ) a high ir @xmath15-o @xmath23 sensitivity ratio , which is about 60 times higher than that in the vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) region  @xcite and ( 2 ) a large survey area that covers more than one whole brillouin zone ( bz ) in the 3d @xmath11 space .",
    "this is made possible by scanning a photoelectron acceptance angle of about 10@xmath24 and a photon energy of over 350  ev  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we discover @xmath11-resolved electronic structures in the rp - iridates consistent with a bz derived from a simple square or cubic ir lattice , in contrast to the previously reported uv and vuv - arpes results  @xcite .",
    "folded bands attributed to lattice distortions and/or magnetic ordering give significantly weak ( but finite ) contributions to the spectrum as a result of a matrix element effect dominant in the sx region . through careful analysis , we conclude that a superposition of the folded and unfolded band structures has been commonly observed in arpes experiments using photons in both uv and sx regions .",
    "meanwhile , we successfully observe the electronic structures unique to each iridate and find direct evidence for the insulator - to - metal transition .",
    "the @xmath5=1/2 band moves across @xmath19 with increasing iridate dimensionality .",
    "furthermore , an emerging band along the @xmath6(0,0,0)-r(@xmath7,@xmath7,@xmath7 ) direction is shown to play a crucial role in the metallic behavior observed in sr113 .",

    "furthermore , it is clear that the photoelectron - intensity ratio of the folded band relative to the other unfolded bands does not change over the range of h@xmath35@xmath36400 and 800  ev  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that either the folded or unfolded band is not derived from the surface structures since the probing depth changes from about 9 to 15  with increasing photon energy .",
