    "<S> the mechanical relaxation spectra of a superconducting and a non - superconducting mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 samples were measured from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature at frequency of kilohertz . </S>",
    "<S> there are two internal friction peaks ( at 300 k labeled as p1 and 125 k as p2 ) for the superconducting sample . for the non - superconducting one , the position of p1 shifts to 250 k , while p2 is almost completely depressed . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the peak position of p2 shifts towards higher temperature under higher measuring frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated activation energy is 0.13ev . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an explanation relating p2 to the carbon atom jumping among the off - center positions . and further we expect that the behaviors of carbon atoms maybe correspond to the normal state crossovers around 150 k and 50 k observed by many other experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2author to whom correspondence should be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> email address : ynhuang@nju.edu.cn    = 10000    pacs number : 74.25.ld , 74.70.ad,71.20.lp    the superconductivity has been found in intermetallic compounds of the general formula mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 [ 1 ] , which has the antiperovskite structure . </S>",
    "<S> many researches have been focused on the possible magnetism or magnetic instability due to a large amount of ni in this compound [ 2 - 5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 band structure displays a characteristic very large and narrow peak in the density of states ( dos ) just below the fermi energy [ 6,7 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then it is expected that the magnetic interaction still exists in mgc@xmath3ni@xmath1 and there are magnetic fluctuations in superconducting mgc@xmath3ni@xmath1 [ 8 ] , which is reminiscent of the lnni@xmath4b@xmath4c family [ 9 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> another aspect of mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 is the possibility of conventional phonon - coupled paring [ 6,10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the light element , carbon , might play an important role on the superconductivity in mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 in the frame of electron - phonon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this viewpoint is also associated with the recently found mgb@xmath4 compound with the superconducting transition temperature about 40 k [ 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the light element boron results in the high phonon frequency , and hence the higher transition temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> there are some unresolved questions in the normal state such as the crossover behavior located around 50 k and the `` knee '' near 150 k [ 8,12,13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that the superconductivity is critically dependent on the carbon concentration in mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 is smaller than about 0.85 , the superconductivity is completely suppressed and the `` knee '' near 150 k disappears . </S>",
    "<S> while when @xmath5 is larger than 0.85 both the superconductivity and the `` knee '' recover . </S>",
    "<S> in this report , we measured the mechanical relaxation spectra of a superconducting ( @xmath6 ) and a non - superconducting ( @xmath7 ) mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparative study would throw some insights into the mechanism for the superconductivity of mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> two ceramic samples of mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 with different carbon content were prepared by conventional method as described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 12 . </S>",
    "<S> resistance of the samples was measured by the standard four - probe technique and the result was shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature t@xmath8 of the superconducting mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 sample is 7 k.    internal friction ( @xmath9 ) and modulus ( @xmath10 ) of the mechanical relaxation spectra were measured by frequency - modulation - acoustic - attenuation ( fmaa - i ) equipment made in the university of science and technology of china . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensions of the rectangular bars of the samples are 5@xmath111@xmath110.2mm@xmath12 with resonant frequencies from 2600 to 4100 </S>",
    "<S> hz .    the mechanical relaxation spectra of a superconducting and a non - superconducting samples on heating , with the rate about 1 k / min , were shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> for the superconducting sample , there are two internal friction peaks ( at 300 k labeled as p1 and 125 k as p2 ) . with increasing the measured frequency , the position of p2 shifts towards higher temperature , which is shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> then it is expected that p2 may be due to the thermally activated process . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated activation energy @xmath13 and the pre - exponential factor @xmath14 hz , by a fit of the arrhenius relation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the resonant frequency and @xmath17 peak temperature . </S>",
    "<S> but p1 does not show clear shift within experimental errors . for the non - superconducting sample , </S>",
    "<S> p2 is nearly completely suppressed and p1 has shifted towards 250 k.    the relative changes of modulus of the two samples @xmath18 , which can be obtained by the following formula @xmath19 , are also shown in the figure 2 , where @xmath20 is the resonant frequency , and @xmath21 the resonant frequency at 81 k. no clear softening point ( local minimum ) of modulus was observed in our measured temperature range , which indicates there is no lattice instability . </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent with the powder diffraction experiment results [ 14 ] , which shows that the lattice parameter and the debye - waller factors for individual atoms decrease smoothly with decreasing temperature , and no unusual change of the structure parameters near t@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this is different to the case for superconducting bkbo with the perovskite structure , where structure instability was observed [ 15,16 ] . on the other hand , there are modulus defects corresponding to p1 and p2 peaks for the superconducting sample . </S>",
    "<S> but only one modulus defect appears around 260 for the non - superconducting one .    in figure 4 , </S>",
    "<S> the prediction of debye theory , @xmath22 , is compared with p2 peak , where @xmath23 is the relaxation strength , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the prediction is much narrower than the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> so , the cole - cole law [ 17 ] , @xmath26 $ ] , is used to fit the experimental results . in the fitting , background internal friction , @xmath27 , that may originate from the low temperature tail of p1 peak @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> , is firstly subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted @xmath29 that means there exist strong correlations between the relaxation units [ 18 ] .    due to both the small activation energy and small pre - exponential factor of the relaxation time of p2 peak , @xmath13 and @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> hz , we expect that it is related to the off - center hoping of carbon atoms [ 19 ] . </S>",
    "<S> usually , the perovskite oxide presents the ferroelectricity , which is due to the ordering of off - center light ions in the octahedral structure . in mgc@xmath3ni@xmath1 , light element carbon locates in the center of octahedron . </S>",
    "<S> then carbons might posses the off - center configurations and hop among the off - center sites . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that this off - centered configuration does not alternate the average crystalline symmetry and average symmetry of carbon atoms when no ordering takes place . </S>",
    "<S> then it is not easy to be observed by other experiments . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of off - center hopping leads to mechanical energy loss and modulus defect , and the activation energy and the pre - exponential factor are usually small , such as the off - center relaxation process of oxygen atoms in yba@xmath4cu@xmath1o@xmath30 [ 20 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> p2 peak is observed only in superconducting sample , and in non - superconducting samples it is largely depressed . </S>",
    "<S> this might provide some important information on the superconducting in mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ren @xmath31 @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> [ 12 ] investigated the structure feature of a series of mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 in detail . </S>",
    "<S> they observed two different phases of mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 , non - superconducting @xmath33-mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 phase and superconducting @xmath34-mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 phase . </S>",
    "<S> due to the smaller lattice parameter of @xmath35-mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 phase , the off - center configurations would be suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent with the result that p2 is depressed in the non - superconducting sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the off - center configurations will be smeared with the increase of temperature and consequently , there will be a crossover point somewhat above p2 peak temperature ( 125 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this might correspond to the `` knee '' near 150k observed in the resistivity , thermal power and thermal conductivity in superconducting mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 [ 12,13 ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there exist strong correlations among the off - center carbon atoms as mentioned above , which will lead to their ordering at low temperature . whether this ordering is related to the electronic crossover near 50 k [ 8,13 ] </S>",
    "<S> needs further studies in superconducting mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 .    as to the p1 peak , due to its appearing in both superconducting and non - superconducting samples , it is speculated that it may be related to the jumping of carbon vacancies between different octahedrons . </S>",
    "<S> usually , this kind of jumping process is almost impossible in perovskite , but mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 is the so - called anti - perovskite , where nickel atoms , other than oxygen ones , form the octahedrons , so that the binding to the center atoms is weak . moreover , carbon is light element that is easy to jump . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the nickel atoms nearest to the carbon vacancies shift from the idealized positions [ 21 ] , which will increase the mobility of carbon vacancies and create local distortions . as a result , internal friction peak and modulus defect is observed .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the mechanical relaxation spectra of superconducting and non - superconducting mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 samples from liquid nitrogen temperature to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a thermally activated relaxation peak is observed around 125k in superconducting sample . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that it should be due to the off - center hopping of carbon atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this internal friction peak is almost fully depressed in non - superconducting samples . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that this process is closely related to the superconductivity in mgc@xmath0ni@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the other peak near 300k , which appears in both superconducting and non - superconducting samples , is speculated to be related to the jumping of carbon vacancies between different octahedrons . </S>"
