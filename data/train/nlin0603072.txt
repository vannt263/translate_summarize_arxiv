    "the hirota direct method is one of the famous method to construct multi - soliton solutions of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "hirota gave the exact solution of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation for multiple collisions of solitons by using the hirota direct method in @xmath0 @xcite . in his successive articles",
    ", he dealt also with many other nonlinear evolution equations such as the modified korteweg - de vries ( mkdv ) @xcite , sine - gordon ( sg ) @xcite , nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) @xcite and toda lattice ( tl ) @xcite equations .",
    "the first step of this method is to transform the nonlinear partial differential or difference equation into a quadratic form in dependent variables .",
    "the new form of the equation is called bilinear form. in the second step , we write the bilinear form the equation as a polynomial of a special differential operator , hirota d - operator .",
    "this polynomial of d - operator is called hirota bilinear form. in fact , some equations may not be written in the hirota bilinear form but perhaps in trilinear or multilinear forms @xcite .",
    "the last step of the method is using the finite perturbation expansion in the hirota bilinear form .",
    "we analyze the coefficients of the perturbation parameter and its powers separately . here",
    "the information we gain makes us to reach the exact solution of the equation .",
    "the equations having hirota bilinear form possesses automatically one- and two - soliton solutions .",
    "but when we try to construct the three - soliton solutions we come across a very restrictive condition",
    ". this condition was used as a powerful tool to search the integrability of the equations by hietarinta @xcite .",
    "hietarinta also used this condition to produce new integrable equations in his articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "most of the works dealt with the hirota direct method is about the integrable equations .",
    "but in this work , we show that the hirota direct method also can be used to find exact solutions of some non - integrable nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "for illustration we consider an extension of the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) equation , @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants and @xmath5 for @xmath6 , @xmath7 are independent variables .",
    "this extension of the kp equation has bilinear and hirota bilinear form so the hirota direct method is applicable .",
    "but when we obtain exact solutions , we shall consider the case @xmath8 . in this case",
    "the equation turns out to be @xmath9 and we call it as the extended kadomtsev - petviashvili ( ekp ) equation .",
    "this equation is integrable if @xmath10 .",
    "the equation with this condition is equivalent to the kp equation .",
    "we find exact solution of this equation by using the hirota method for all @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "another example to this fact is the extension of the boussinesq ( bo ) equation which is @xmath11 similar to the extension of the kp equation , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants .",
    "when @xmath12 , we can also apply the hirota method to this equation since it has bilinear and hirota bilinear form . but again , when we consider the exact solutions , we shall take @xmath8 .",
    "so we deal with the equation @xmath13 which we call the extended boussinesq ( ebo ) equation .",
    "the ebo equation is integrable if @xmath14 . indeed , under this condition , it is equivalent to the bo equation .",
    "the hirota method gives the exact solutions of the ebo equation for all @xmath2 , @xmath3 . before passing to the application of the hirota direct method ,",
    "let us see how this method works .",
    "we review the hirota direct method in four steps by following hietarinta s article @xcite closely .",

    "<S> we show that we can also apply the hirota method to some non - integrable equations . for this purpose , we consider the extensions of the kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) and the boussinesq ( bo ) equations . </S>",
    "<S> we present several solutions of these equations . </S>"
