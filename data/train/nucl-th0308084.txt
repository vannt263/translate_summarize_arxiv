    "it is now accepted that qcd is the theory which underlies all of nuclear structure . a fundamental question we may then ask is : how do nuclear energy levels change as we vary the quark masses in the qcd lagrangian ?",
    "this is not solely an intellectual exercise ; there are hints that the fundamental parameters of the standard model , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , may be time - dependent  @xcite .",
    "the successful predictions of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) can be used to constrain the time dependence of these parameters and thereby search for physics beyond the standard model  @xcite@xcite .",
    "however in order to do so one must know how nuclear physics depends on the fundamental parameters .",
    "a more practical motivation for understanding the quark mass dependence of nuclear physics , and more generally of hadronic physics , is that in the near future it is through lattice qcd simulations that definitive predictions in nuclear physics will be made directly from qcd . and",
    "because lattice qcd is currently simulated with unphysically large quark masses , there is an inevitable extrapolation to physical quark masses .",
    "if rigorous predictions are to be had from the lattice , this extrapolation must be controlled in a precise way .",
    "fortunately , the quark - mass dependence of few - nucleon systems can be studied by exploiting hierarchies of scales : i.e. by using effective field theory ( eft )  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "given the current state of technology , simulations of multi - nucleon systems are intractable , but realistic simulations of two - nucleon systems are feasible .",
    "arguably , the most promising method is to calculate scattering phase shifts directly using lscher s finite - volume algorithm , which , for instance , expresses the ground - state energy of a two - particle state as a perturbative expansion in the scattering length divided by the size of the box  @xcite .",
    "this method has been used successfully to study @xmath2 scattering  @xcite .",
    "attempts have been made to compute nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering parameters in lattice qcd ; ref .",
    "@xcite computes the @xmath3 and @xmath4 scattering lengths in quenched qcd ( qqcd ) using lscher s method .",
    "of course in the nn system , the scattering lengths are much larger than the characteristic physical length scale given by @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless one may expect that at some unphysical value of the pion mass used in a lattice simulation , the scattering lengths relax to natural values , thus allowing their determination from the lattice .",
    "this is yet another motivation for understanding the quark - mass dependence of few - nucleon systems .",
    "presently , unquenched lattice simulations with the physical values of the light - quark masses are prohibitively time - consuming , even on the fastest machines .",
    "while some quenched calculations can be performed with the physical quark masses there is no limit in which they reproduce qcd , and consequently they should be considered to be a warm - up exercise for the `` real thing '' .",
    "relatively recently it was realized that partially - quenched ( pq ) simulations , in which the sea quarks are more massive than the valence quarks , provide a rigorous way to determine qcd observables and are less time - consuming than their qcd counterparts .",
    "it is with pq simulations that nuclear - physics observables will first be calculated rigorously from qcd . as pqqcd reproduces qcd only in the limit in which the sea - quark masses become equal to the valence - quark masses which , in turn , are set equal to the physical values of the light quark masses ( we call this the qcd limit ) , there are some interesting features of the pq theory that are distinct from nature away from the qcd limit . in qcd ,",
    "the long - distance component of the nn potential is due to ope , as discussed above .",
    "however , in pqqcd there is also a contribution from the exchange of the @xmath6-meson ( in the theory with two flavors of light quarks ) . in qcd such an exchange is suppressed due to the large mass of the @xmath6 compared to the @xmath7 . however , in pqqcd the @xmath6 propagator has a double - pole component that depends on the pion mass due to the hairpin interactions with a coefficient that depends upon the difference between the masses of the sea and valence quarks .",
    "therefore , away from the qcd limit the long - distance component of the nn potential is dominated by one - eta exchange ( oee ) and falls exponentially with a range determined by the pion mass , @xmath8 , as opposed to the familiar yukawa type behavior  @xcite .",
    "all is not lost however : it is straightforward to develop the partially - quenched eft which matches to a partially - quenched lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "a second approach to the nn system on the lattice is to study the simplified problem of two interacting heavy - light particles  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that lattice qcd simulations of the potential between hadrons containing a heavy quark will provide insight into the nature of the intermediate - range force between two nucleons  @xcite .",
    "while the nn potential is not itself an observable , one may instead consider heavy systems .",
    "in the heavy - quark limit , the kinetic energy of the heavy hadrons is absent and the lowest - lying energy eigenvalues , which can be measured on the lattice , are given by the interaction potential .",
    "all discussions to date have addressed two heavy mesons .",
    "this case is somewhat complicated by the fact that there are degeneracies in the heavy - quark limit which require a coupled - channel analysis .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath9 interaction ( where the @xmath10 is the lowest - lying baryon containing one heavy quark , @xmath11 ) , does not suffer from this complication  @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath10 is an isosinglet , there is no ope , and the leading large - distance behavior is governed by two - pion exchange ( tpe ) , which is physics analogous to the intermediate - range attraction in the nn potential .    in this proceedings",
    "i will review recent work in developing the efts relevant to understanding the quark - mass dependence of the nn system and the @xmath9 potential , both in qcd and in pqqcd .",
    "during the last decade significant effort has been expended in constructing an eft to describe nuclear physics . while it is straightforward to write down all possible terms in the effective lagrangian for two or more nucleons , arriving at a consistent power - counting has proved to be a difficult task .",
    "weinberg s ( w ) original proposal  @xcite for an eft describing multi - nucleon systems was to determine the nn potentials using the organizational principles of the well - established efts describing the meson - sector and single - nucleon sector ( chiral perturbation theory , @xmath12pt ) , and then to insert these potentials into the schrdinger equation to solve for nn wavefunctions .",
    "observables are computed as matrix elements of operators between these wavefunctions .",
    "w power - counting has been extensively and successfully developed during the past decade to study processes in the few - nucleon systems  @xcite .",
    "this method is intrinsically numerical and is similar in spirit to traditional nuclear - physics potential theory .",
    "unfortunately , there are formal inconsistencies in w power - counting  @xcite , in particular , divergences that arise at leading order ( lo ) in the chiral expansion can not be absorbed by the lo operators .",
    "problems persist at all orders in the chiral expansion , and the correspondence between divergences and counterterms appears to be lost , leading to uncontrolled errors in the predictions for observables .",
    "this formal issue was partially resolved by kaplan , savage and wise ( ksw ) who introduced a power - counting in which pions are treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "the nn phase - shifts and mixing angle in the @xmath3 and @xmath13 coupled - channels have been computed to next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath14lo ) in the ksw expansion by fleming , mehen and stewart ( fms )  @xcite from which it can be concluded that the ksw expansion converges slowly in the @xmath3 channel and does not converge in the @xmath13 coupled - channels .",

    "this recovers ksw power - counting in the @xmath3 channel , where fms found it to be slowly converging .",
