    "<S> two strongly - pumped parametric interactions are simultaneously realized in a single nonlinear crystal in order to generate three strongly correlated optical fields . by combining together the outputs of two of the three detectors measuring intensities of the generated fields , we obtain the joint photocount statistics between the single field and the sum of the other two . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we develop a microscopic quantum theory to determine the joint photon - number distribution and the joint quasi - distributions of integrated intensities and prove nonclassical nature of the three - mode state . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by performing a conditional measurement on the single field , we obtain a state endowed with a sub - poissonian statistics , as testified by the analysis of the conditional fano factor . </S>",
    "<S> the role of quantum detection efficiencies in this conditional state - preparation method is discussed in detail . </S>"
