    "to quantify the contributions of fundamental and composite degrees of freedom to the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter is a very difficult task .",
    "on general grounds , one expects that at very low temperatures the light and relatively weakly interacting pions should dominate the partition function , whereas at high temperatures the relevant degrees of freedom are believed to be almost free quarks and gluons .",
    "unfortunately , when studying chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in qcd , where the non perturbative regime plays a major role , we are not able , at present , to describe in a quantitative way , starting from the fundamental lagrangian , what happens in going from low to high temperatures .",
    "quantitative results concerning the low - temperature behaviour of the fermion condensate and of the pion decay constant for massless quarks have been presented by gasser and leutwyler @xcite , who make use of an effective lagrangian for pions , assumed to dominate the thermodynamics in this regime .",
    "other studies , complementary to ref .  @xcite and to lattice results , have been generally performed by means of models which encompass some properties of qcd , with the nice feature of starting directly from the fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , they generally do not go beyond a mean field description , neglecting the role of bosonic fluctuations .",
    "this approximation is clearly unsatisfactory for low temperatures , and also it only gives a very rough description of the transition .",
    "it is important to go beyond , at least to understand what  low \" and  high \" temperature mean , i. e. the regions where in qcd only pions or only quarks and gluons would respectively dominate , and also to give an improved description of the region in between .",
    "recently , a certain number of studies have been devoted to this program , by means of large-@xmath1 expansions @xcite , @xmath1 being the number of fermion species , carried out directly at the level of the functional integral describing the partition function .",
    "this procedure allows to preserve the desired symmetries from the beginning @xcite .    at finite temperature , this technique has been applied to the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite and to the 1 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model @xcite . in spite of the approximations involved ( and mainly",
    "the fact that none of them starts from the fundamental qcd lagrangian ) , these studies are useful towards a better description of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration .    here",
    "we present a calculation in the gross - neveu model in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the model exhibits chiral symmetry breaking for couplings stronger than a critical value , and it is renormalizable in the @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "the finite temperature extension of the model , in the mean field approximation , has been studied for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite . at order @xmath0 , the zero temperature effective potential has been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas the finite temperature gap equation has been discussed , by using the ward - takahashi identities , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have calculated the finite temperature propagator of composite states which enters a general formula valid for four - fermion theories @xcite to calculate the finite temperature equation of state .",
    "this procedure had already been followed in studying the gross - neveu model in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "here we perform , for gross - neveu in 2 + 1 dimensions , a full study of the equation of state and we quantify the role of the various contributions from low to high temperatures .",
    "we have studied both the version of the model with discrete chiral symmetry , which is spontaneously broken by mass generation , and the version with continuous chiral symmetry where , due to the effective 2-dimensionality at finite temperature , there is no true phase transition .",
    "thus we have included a bare mass which avoids i. r. divergencies in this case .",
    "it is worth noticing that the full pressure at order @xmath0 is real for any temperature .",
    "this apparently trivial feature is not so obvious , since in general the zero temperature effective potential is not always real for small values of the order parameter , thus indicating either some instability or ill - definiteness of the theory at this level @xcite .",
    "the fact that the value of the effective potential at the absolute minimum turns out to be real for any temperature allows for a safe @xmath1-expansion of the model .    in conclusion , by exploring the @xmath0 approximation to the equation of state in the whole range of temperatures",
    "it comes out that the naive expectation that pions dominate the partition function at low temperatures is respected , as well as the free - fermion dominance far above the critical temperature .",
    "nevertheless the results show that the pion dominance is limited for temperature ranging from zero to about @xmath3 , for a reasonable value of the chiral symmetry breaking term .",
    "furthermore , in the critical region , where nonperturbative effects are crucial , the mean field pressure is strongly modified by the @xmath0 correction , even for large @xmath1 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "<S> we consider both the discrete and continuous symmetry versions of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the pion - like excitations give the dominant contribution at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the range of validity for such pion dominance is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the complete analysis from low to high temperatures also shows that in the critical region the role of composite states is relevant , even for quite large @xmath1 , and that the free - component behaviour at high @xmath2 starts at about twice the mean field critical temperature .    </S>",
