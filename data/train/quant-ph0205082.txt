    "in an atomic sample the population of a state @xmath0 can be measured non - destructively by a phase shift measurement of an optical field which acts on a transition from the state @xmath0 .",
    "if the field is not too close to resonance , it does not drive transitions out of the state @xmath0 , but an initial state vector of the sample with a binomial distribution of states with varying populations @xmath1 will be modified , and the quantum mechanical uncertainty of the number @xmath1 is reduced .",
    "this effect has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite , and further experiments have shown @xcite , that two separate atomic ensembles can be driven into an entangled state by measurements of the total phaseshifts on an optical field passing through both samples .",
    "a state preparation protocol that applies the outcome of quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements strongly relies on the fact that the measurement entails precisely the information that is applied in the changes of the state vector .",
    "when light interacts with atoms , apart from a phase shift of the incident field mode , also scattering out of the field mode occurs .",
    "the phase shift results from the interference between the incident field and the component of the scattered field in the incident mode , whereas scattering out of the incident mode is represented by components of the scattered wave function orthogonal to the incident wave function    the scattered photons carry information about the state of the atoms which is not recorded , and therefore the state of the system will in general not be the one deduced from the phase shift measurements alone , but rather an incoherent mixture of the states that one would have determined if also the scattered photons had been detetected .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the importance of photon scattering for the preparation of atomic states by phase shift measurements .",
    "in particular we shall derive criteria for the possibility to produce spin squeezed states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we introduce the concept of spin squeezing and some useful relations for the mean values and variances of spin operators . in sec . 3 , we present our model for phaseshift measurements , and we introduce a formalism that makes it possible to take photon scattering into account . in sec . 4",
    ", we analyze the information given by the registration of phase shifts only . in sec . 5 , we present simulations and analytical estimates valid for a cloud which is smaller than the optical wavelength , and for which photon scattering does not provide any information about the state of individual atoms .",
    "in sec . 6 , we consider the opposite case where the scattered photons can , in principle , be traced back to individual atoms in the cloud . in sec .",
    "7 , we turn to the more complicated case of a large dense cloud , which turns out to present the most promising case for spin squeezing . sec .",
    "8 concludes the paper .",
    "the term spin squeezing originates in the treatment of two - level atoms as fictitious spin @xmath2 particles , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the familiar @xmath5 pauli matrices in the basis of atomic states @xmath0 and @xmath6 . for a gas of @xmath7 atoms ,",
    "the collective spin components @xmath8 have mean values which characterize the polarization and atomic state populations of the gas and quantum mechanical uncertainties which characterize the population statistics .",
    "for precision in spectroscopy and in atomic clocks it is pertinent to have a large mean spin vector of the sample and to have as small a variance as possible in a spin component orthogonal to the mean spin .",
    "assume that the mean spin points in the @xmath9-direction .",
    "heisenberg s uncertainty relation states that @xmath10 for the state with all atoms in their respective @xmath11 eigenstate , the binomial distribution leads to uncertainties of @xmath12 , in accord with the previous inequality .",
    "it was shown by wineland et al @xcite , that if one can construct spin squeezed states which do not have the same uncertainty in the two spin components orthogonal to the mean spin , one may reduce the variance in a frequency measurement on @xmath7 particles by the factor @xmath13    in @xcite states were identified which for a given @xmath14 have the smallest possible @xmath15 . for large @xmath7 these",
    "are well represented by a gaussian ansatz for the amplitudes on states @xmath16 with different eigenvalues of @xmath17 , in which case one obtains the approximate relation : @xmath18    spin squeezed states may be produced in a number of different ways : by absorption of squeezed light @xcite , by controlled collisional interaction in bose - einstein condensates @xcite or in a classical gas @xcite , by coupling through a single motional degree of freedom or through an optical cavity field mode @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the qnd scheme , analyzed in the present paper , is the automatic matching of the capability to produce the state and the ability to detect spin squeezing , which is done by the same kind of measurement . to verify that",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath1 have been reduced , one has to to show that two subsequent measurements agree ( to within the desired uncertainty ) .",
    "if one can produce a state with reduced number fluctuations by means of a qnd measurement , one will also have the resolving power to make use of such reduction in a high - precision experiment .",
    "in fig . [ fig.setup ] , we illustrate a physical setup , where a beam of light enters a stern - gerlach interferometer which contains an atomic sample in one of its arms . by lenses",
    ", the field is focussed on the sample of transverse dimension @xmath19 . for simplicity , we assume that the decomposition in plane waves of the incident photons is uniform for all angles @xmath20 smaller than the focussing angle @xmath21 which",
    ", in turn , is so small that the incident field is homogeneous across the area of the atomic cloud .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the probability amplitude per unit surface for a photon to pass at the center of the mode ( @xmath23 gives the probability that the photon passes in the area @xmath24 around the center .",
    "a second lens maps the field back onto the inital mode , and the second beam splitter of the interferometer recombines the optical beams for read out of the phase shift induced by the presence of atoms in the lower part of the interferometer .",
    "the atoms populate states @xmath0 and @xmath6 , and the optical field couples off - resonantly the state @xmath0 to an auxiliary atomic state , so that a phase shift on the light field is induced which is proportional to the population @xmath1 .",
    "we now take into account the scattering of the photons by the atoms .",
    "the scattering is the normal spontaneous emission by the atom , given in the electric dipole approximation by well known angular distributions for photons of different polarization .",
    "since our purpose is not to determine the angular distribution of scattered light , but rather to estimate its damaging effect on the atomic state preparation , we assume simply that every atom scatters photons isotropically with amplitude @xmath25 . at low atomic saturation ,",
    "the scattered photons are coherent with the incident field .",
    "we shall present a calculation in which the photons are scattered one at a time by the sample .",
    "the scattered part of the wave function of a single photon is entangled with the state of the atomic sample , since an atomic state with a definite sequence of atoms populating the state @xmath0 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 or @xmath28 leads to the photonic wave function @xmath29 where @xmath30 depends on the state of the atomic sample .    in the first born approximation ,",
    "@xmath30 is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the difference between the scattered and the incident wave vectors . for @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    in the born approximation ,",
    "the flux of photons is not conserved . to remedy this problem , we write the angular part of the photon wave function far from the atomic sample ( sum of the scattered wave function and of the incident wave function ) in the following form which is equivalent to the first order born approximation but which conserves the photon flux .",
    "@xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given by eq.([eq.f ] ) .",
    "if the atomic sample is in one of the states @xmath38 , this state is unchanged by the transmission of a photon through the interferometer .",
    "the scattering state of the photon , however , depends , on the argument @xmath39 , and taking into account the unscattered component in the upper arm , we write this state in quantum notation as @xmath40    if the initial state of the cloud is in a superposition of different states @xmath38 the joint state of the photon and the atoms becomes the entangled state @xmath41    it is at this stage , that the photodetection takes place .",
    "the photodetector 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) of hte interferometer detects photons in the mode @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) , with @xmath44 the field transmitted by the lower path of the interferometer in the absence of atoms .",
    "the detection of a photon in one of the detectors sketched in fig.[fig.setup ] thus extracts the corresponding projection of the state vector @xmath45 .",
    "this projection causes a non - continuous change of the atomic state vector amplitudes , @xmath46 we recall that @xmath1 and @xmath47 depend on @xmath39 .",
    "the probabilities , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , to detect the photon in detector modes 1 and 2 are given by the squared norms of the vectors described by the new amplitudes after application of either projection according to ( [ jump12 ] ) .",
    "one may thus simulate the detection process by chosing one of the two prescriptions , update the amplitudes and renormalize the state vector .",
    "detection of many photons is simulated by iterative updating of the state vector amplitudes .",
    "in addition to the detection events just described , we have identified the possibility for photons to be scattered into other directions @xmath50 .",
    "the effect of such an event is of precisely the same character as the projections just described .",
    "if the photon is detected in the direction @xmath50 , the corresponding projection operator amounts to multiplying each amplitude of the initial atomic state with the corresponding scattering amplitude @xmath51 the detector actually has a finite size and detects the photon in a mode with @xmath25 centered around @xmath50 but spread over @xmath52 . with @xmath53 ,",
    "the scattered wave function is constant over @xmath52 and the probability to detect a scattered photon within the solid angle @xmath52 in the direction @xmath50 is thus @xmath54 and the corresponding change of atomic state vector amplitudes given by ( [ jumpomega ] ) .    to simulate the scattering of photons we divide the surface of the scattering sphere in sections by longitudes and lattitudes , and we imagine detectors located in each section .",
    "the poles of the sphere are in the direction of the incident beam and the solid angle delimited by @xmath55 correponding to the incident beam is of course not covered by such detectors since photons emitted in this solid angle go in the interferometer . for each incident photon ,",
    "the probability to have a click in each detector of the sphere is computed . by adding the probabilities we compute @xmath47 and we determine the probabilities to detect the photon in the detectors 1 or 2 . the detector in which the photon is detected",
    "is chosen randomly in the simulation accordingly to all the calculated probabilities , and the state of the atoms is modified according to ( [ jump12 ] ) or ( [ jumpomega ] ) .",
    "we shall now analyze the states resulting from the interaction with the field and the detection of the photons . in this section",
    "we neglect photon scattering , and we study only the effect of photons measured in detectors 1 and 2 .",
    "we thus assume that @xmath56 , in which case we can rewrite the factors in ( [ jump12 ] ) , and obtain the state of the atoms after the detection of @xmath57 photons in 1 and @xmath58 photons in detector 2 , @xmath59 in this equation we have ignored a phase factor @xmath60 , which corresponds to a phase shift of the state @xmath61 or a rotation around @xmath62 in the spin language .",
    "to avoid such a rotation , one may apply an energy shift on state @xmath0 or an alternative measurement scheme , where atoms in state @xmath6 are also detected by optical phase shifts .    as a consequence of the photodetections ,",
    "the populations of states with a definite number @xmath1 of atoms in state @xmath0 are thus multiplied by the factors @xmath63    by differentiation with respect to @xmath1 , we find that @xmath64 is peaked at values @xmath65 which obey , @xmath66 the values @xmath65 correspond of course to atomic populations so that the probability for the photons to be detected in modes @xmath67 and @xmath68 after the interaction are in agreement with the ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 observed by the measurement .    to estimate the width of @xmath71",
    ", we calculate the second derivative of @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "we find that @xmath73 so , the more photons that are transmitted , the narrower is the width of the peaks in @xmath71 .",
    "the width does not depend on the initial relative phase @xmath74 between the two arms of the interferometer or on the result of the measurement .",
    "if we suppose that @xmath75 is gaussian , the following equation gives the rms width of @xmath75 in @xmath1 @xmath76    the equation ( [ eq.naointer ] ) has several solutions due to the two possible signs , and due to the periodicity of the @xmath77-funtion .",
    "if several such solutions lie within the initial binomial distribution of @xmath1 , the state obtained after the measurement will be a coherent superposition of spin states with different mean values of @xmath17 , i.e. , a kind of  schrdinger cat \"",
    ". however , a change of @xmath57 or @xmath58 by unity changes the relative phase between peaks by @xmath78 .",
    "thus , with realistic photon detectors with an efficiency smaller than unity , the relative phase is unknown and the system is described by a statistical mixture of the states .    in order to obtain spin squeezing , we want to ensure that only a single value of @xmath65 inside the initial distribution obeys eq.([eq.naointer ] ) , so that the detection unambiguosly leads to a more narrow distribution in @xmath1 .",
    "this requires @xmath79    eq.([wineland ] ) shows that it is not enough to reduce the uncertainty in @xmath17 to have useful spin squeezing , one must also ensure that the mean value of @xmath80 remains large .",
    "the outcome of the interferometric detection is close to ideal in this respect .",
    "the resulting state vector has amplitudes on the different @xmath17 eigenstates which follow a gaussian distribution very well , and the approximation ( [ gauss ] ) for the mean spin is close to the maximum possible value for any given variance of @xmath17 .    using eqs.(4,18 )",
    "we obtain : @xmath81 the minimum value of @xmath82 , for a fixed @xmath7 , is @xmath83 and is obtained for the photon number @xmath84 .",
    "this value of @xmath82 is the minimum value allowed as shown in @xcite .    for a large number of atoms , the squeezing factor ( [ xiperf ] ) can be really significant .",
    "the production of spin squeezed states by qnd detection is susceptible , however , to two possible drawbacks caused by scattering of photons :    * scattered photons carry information about @xmath17 , so that this quantity could in principle be known better than the width of @xmath71 , and according to eq.([gauss ] ) , the mean spin will be reduced *   scattered photons carry information about the spatial distribution of atoms in the state @xmath61 .",
    "the state is then no longer symmetric under exchange of the particles , @xmath85-values smaller than @xmath86 become populated , and the mean spin is accordingly reduced .",
    "we shall now turn to a quantitative analysis of these effects .",
    "in this section we consider the case of a cloud of atoms confined to a region in space smaller than the optical wavelength .",
    "this implies that the scattered photons will not contain information about the individual atoms in the ensemble .",
    "they will , however , carry information about @xmath1 that is not known to the experimentalist who measures only the fields by the detectors 1 and 2 .      in a numerical simulation of the detection process",
    "we place atoms randomly in space according to a gaussian probability distribution , and we assume an initial state where all atoms are in @xmath87 .",
    "no restriction is made on the state at later times , which is expanded on the whole space of dimension @xmath88 .    .",

    "the variance of the distribution of atoms in @xmath61 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath91 ) is plotted as well as the value expected from the results of section [ sec.interferometre ] ( _ i.e. _ , the multiplication of the initial distribution with the function @xmath71 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath92 keeps almost the initial maximal value of @xmath94 which indicates that the cloud stays in a symmetric state .",
    "this is expected as the atoms are closer to each other than @xmath95 and then it is not possible to discriminate between the atoms with the scattered photons .",
    "the last graph plots the value of @xmath96 and of @xmath97 which is the length of the mean spin in the horizontal plane , and which may be larger than the @xmath9-component because of small angular spin rotations that occur during photon scattering .     as a function of the number of photons launched on the atoms .",

    "both in fig.[fig.1histpres ] . , and in fig.[fig.numpres_2 ]",
    ", we observe that the actual width in @xmath17 is smaller than the one concluded from the interferometric measurement  : the fact that the atoms are coupled to other modes of the field also leads to squeezing .",
    "we recall , however , that the quantity @xmath91 is not a measurable quantity as @xmath104 depends on the particular history . to exploit the squeezing due to scattering",
    ", one has to deduce @xmath104 for each experiment by keeping track of the scattered photons .",
    "the effect of the scattered photons can be computed analytically .",
    "taking @xmath105 for all @xmath106 , eq.([eq.f ] ) and eq.([jumpomega ] ) show that the atomic state vector amplitudes are multiplied simply by the coefficient @xmath107 after the detection of a scattered photon , and by the coefficient @xmath108 in the absense of scattering where @xmath109 is the scattering probability per atom in state @xmath0 .",
    "after the detection of @xmath110 out of a total number of @xmath111 photons , the wave function of the atoms becomes @xmath112 so the probability distribution for @xmath1 is multiplied by @xmath113    this function is maximum on @xmath114 and its width can be estimated by assuming a gaussian shape with the same second derivative at the peak value @xmath115 this width is always smaller than the width in @xmath1 of the function @xmath116 because @xmath117 , which is about the inverse of the transverse size of the beam on the cloud is always smaller than @xmath118 , @xmath119    in every single realization , the width of the @xmath1 distribution is thus set by the number of scattered photons . after averaging over the unkown number of scattered photons we recover the broader distribution determined by the interferometer readout @xmath57 and @xmath101 .",
    "since the scattered photons do not drive atoms out of or into the state @xmath0 , the atomic density matrix obtained by an average over the number of scattered photons has the same diagonal elements in the basis @xmath120 as the pure state that one would expect without photon scattering .",
    "but , the coherence terms of the density matrix are different from that of the pure state , and therefore the length of the mean spin will be altered by the scattering events .",
    "this is seen in fig.[fig.numpres_2 ] b ) , where the three lower curves show the actual value of @xmath14 , of @xmath121 and of the estimate ( [ gauss ] ) , based on the small variance of @xmath17 due to the scattering .",
    "there is excellent agreement between these curves .",
    "the upper curve shows the larger value of the mean spin , that one would have obtained in the absence of scattering .",
    "our numerical simulations and our analytical estimates show that the effect of the scattering is to produce stronger squeezing than the interference measurement . after averaging over the unresolved scattering histories this",
    "squeezing does not affect the @xmath1 populations .",
    "but , its effect is to reduce the mean spin @xmath14 . in principle",
    "one could determine the number of scattered photons by the difference betwen the number of incident photons and the number of photons detected in the interferometer .",
    "for a poissonian source of light , however , this number can not be determined to a higher precision than @xmath122 , which turns out to be larger than the required precision on the loss in photon number due to scattering .",
    "as pointed out in section [ sec.spinrepresentation ] , the pertinent factor for spin squeezing is @xmath82 defined in eq.([wineland ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq.dnaint ] ) for @xmath15 and eqs.(4,25 ) to determine @xmath123 , we obtain    @xmath124    the minimum value of @xmath82 , for a fixed @xmath7 , is @xmath125 and is obtained for the photon number @xmath126 . because the size of the incident beam is larger than the wave length , @xmath127 and @xmath128",
    "is larger than in the ideal case ( [ xiperf ] ) .",
    "the effect of the scattering in the case of a cloud of extension larger than @xmath95 is very different from the case of a small cloud .",
    "the number of scattered photons will still , as in the case of a small cloud , give us information on the total number of atoms in @xmath61 and thus scattering will by itself produce squeezing .",
    "but in the case of a big cloud the angular distribution of the scattered photons gives also information on the position of the atoms in @xmath61 and the atomic system therefore looses its invariance under permutation of the particles .",
    "the system will thus no longer be fully represented by the ( @xmath129 ) dicke states of maximal @xmath130 .",
    "this does not affect the @xmath62 component of the spin but it strongly reduces the horizontal component of the spin .      in order to analyse the effect of the scattering alone",

    "it is also clear that the decrease of @xmath131 is not as rapid as suggested by eq.([eq.sqdiff ] ) which was valid for the small cloud .",
    "let us present a naive argument for the decrease of @xmath131 : assume that the cloud is in a state @xmath38 where each atom is either in @xmath61 or @xmath28 .",
    "this state is unaffected by the interaction with the photon field .",
    "let @xmath132 denote the probability that a photon is scattered by the cloud of atoms . in the absence of superradiance",
    "we expect @xmath133 .",
    "the number of scattered photons @xmath134 thus has mean value @xmath135 and uncertainty @xmath136 , and we estimate @xmath1 by @xmath137 with an uncertainty of @xmath138 .",
    "if the state of the cloud expands over different @xmath1 , the measurement of @xmath134 will reduce the width of the distribution by multiplying with a function of width @xmath138 .",
    "taking @xmath139 and an initial state where all atoms are in @xmath87 @xmath140 this function is plotted in fig.[fig.atomesloinscatt ] ( a ) .",
    "it reproduces quite well the numerical evolution , although the numerical evolution shows a faster squeezing .    after averaging over histories , as discussed in section [ small.cloud ] ,",
    "the squeezing due to scattering has no effect on the distribution of @xmath1 but it will reduce the horizontal component of the total spin . the upper dashed line in figure [ fig.atomesloinscatt](c ) predicts the reduction due to this effect , according to eq.([gauss ] ) taking @xmath130 .",
    "we see that the horizontal spin determined in our simulation is even smaller than this estimate .",
    "the reason for this is that the state of the cloud is not in the symmetric subspace as assumed when we put @xmath130 in eq.([gauss ] ) .",
    "the state of the cloud may be expanded on subspaces with different total @xmath85 , and the mean value of @xmath80 is averaged over these different subspace components . to check the consistency of this picture we compare the decrease of @xmath141 with that of @xmath14 .",

    "_ ]      if the atomic cloud is dilute enough and not too large it is possible to know by which atom any photon has been emitted .",
    "in other words , it is possible to design an optical system which collects all the photons emitted outside the incident mode and which produces a separate image of each atom .",
    "this implies that the flux of scattered photons is only proportional to @xmath1 and not to @xmath148 : there is no superradiance .",
    "then the scattered photons give information on the total number of atoms in @xmath61 but also on which atoms are in @xmath61 .",
    "the second effect damages the squeezing realised by the interference measurement as it decreases correlations between atoms . when a photon is transmitted , the probability that it is scattered by an atom in @xmath61 is approximately @xmath149 .",
    "thus after about @xmath150 photons have been transmitted , we know almost with certainty if the atom is in @xmath28 or @xmath61 , and there is then almost no correlation between the atoms and hence no squeezing . indeed , as each atom is either in @xmath61 or @xmath28 , @xmath151 for each atom .",

    "the effect on the state of the system associated with the detection of a photon in this solid angle is given by the operator @xmath211 this operator changes the relative phase between the component with fluctuations in cosinus and sinus components . because the operator in eq.(40 ) acts only on the space @xmath196 , no correlations between fluctuations at different wave vector appear and the state of the cloud will thus stay on the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 is a state of the space @xmath196 .",

    "after transmission of @xmath111 photons and the detection of @xmath217 photons scattered in the direction @xmath218 , the wave function in the space @xmath196 becomes @xmath219 thus , the population of the states @xmath199 is multiplied by the factor @xmath220 which depends only on @xmath221 .",

    "the distribution of the population in the basis ( @xmath225 ) for a well defined @xmath195 does not depend on @xmath195 and is given by the projection of the torus on the plane @xmath203 .",
    "_ _ ]      photons scattered in the forward direction in the solid angle @xmath55 give information on @xmath195 and thus on the total number of atoms in @xmath61 .",
    "the other scattered photons give information on the spatial fluctuations of the atoms in @xmath61 and , in the case we consider where the number of atoms per cell is large and approximately constant , no information on @xmath195 is given by the photons scattered outside the solid angle @xmath227 .",
    "this is completely different from the case considered in section [ sec.atomespres ] where in a single experiment the number of atoms in @xmath61 was mainly determined by the scattering .    in the case",
    "considered here , even if @xmath195 is not affected by the scattering outside the incident beam , the state is affected by scattering events due to the departure from the space of states which is symmetric under exchange of atoms . after a series of detections ,",
    "the state of the cloud has components in different subspaces @xmath85 because the scattering ( or its absence ) brings the system into non symmetric states with @xmath228 .",
    "we thus expect @xmath123 to be smaller than the value obtained for a state with the same distribution of @xmath17 eigenstates but in the symmetric subspace @xmath229 .",
    "we have @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the mean value of @xmath80 corresponding to the atoms of the cell @xmath106 .",
    "it is @xmath232 the state is invariant by exchange of atoms inside a single cell , and the results of eq.([gauss ] ) can be used to estimate @xmath233 by    @xmath234    taking @xmath235 , we note that @xmath236 is the rms width of the function @xmath237 where @xmath238 is the final population distribution over the states @xmath239 and @xmath240 is the final population distribution among the states @xmath241 ( it does not depend on the angle @xmath242 ) .    for the initial distribution , @xmath243 has an rms width of @xmath244 in @xmath169 and @xmath245 has an rms width of @xmath246 as a function of @xmath169 .",
    "thus , eq.([eq.fonctionf ] ) gives an rms width @xmath247 equal to @xmath173 for any @xmath248 , which is expected .",
    "after the detection , the width of @xmath249 has been reduced by the interference measurement to @xmath250 and the rms width in @xmath169 of @xmath243 is @xmath251 the detection of scattered photons modifies the distribution @xmath252 which is then no longer separable in @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "but it follows from the definition ( [ eq.defncs ] ) and from eq.[eq.deltanidens ] that , in average , @xmath252 has an rms width in @xmath169 which scales as @xmath253 if we assume that the distribution of @xmath169 is given by the initial gaussian , which is multiplied by gaussian factors due to the interferometric detection and due to the scattering , we obtain the result @xmath254    the squeezing due to scattering and due to interferometric detection is significant , and we can hence ignore the last term , which is due to the initial width of the distribution .",
    "the contribution due to the interferometric detection is given by eq.(18 ) , and the sum over the @xmath106 for which @xmath204 is on the scattering sphere follows from eq.([eq.deltanidens ] ) : @xmath255 by comparison of eq.(18 ) and ( [ just ] ) , we see that the contribution due to interferometric detection is approximately a factor @xmath256 times the one due to scattering .",
    "@xmath257 is larger than the area of the cloud which itself is much larger than @xmath258 .",
    "thus , @xmath259 and the width in @xmath169 is mainly determined by the scattered photons  : @xmath260    coming back to eq.([eq.jxi ] ) and eq.([eq.sumjxi ] ) , we get @xmath261 thus , the squeezing factor writes @xmath262 its minimum value , achieved for @xmath263 , is @xmath264 which is similar to the result obtained for the small cloud and for the dilute sample .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the change of the atomic distribution on internal levels caused by a measurement of the phase shift of an optical field traversing the atomic sample . in every run of the detection experiment ,",
    "the atomic population statistics is modified in accordance with the phase shift measurements . in practical",
    "spin squeezing , the reduced variance in one of the spin components is not the only relevant parameter .",
    "one has to observe the change of the length of the mean spin @xmath123 as well .",
    "the mean spin is reduced , and in case of perfect detection , we estimate the optimum number of detected photons , and the optimum value of the squeezing parameter @xmath265 , ( [ xiperf ] ) .    in an experimental implementation ,",
    "scattering of photons is inevitable .",
    "if these photons are not detected , they will have no average effect on the atomic populations , but scattering leads to further reduction of the mean spin and an increase of @xmath82 .",
    "two different mechanisms are shown to be responsible for this reduction : in case of the small cloud , the scattered photons carry information on @xmath1 , which forces a reduction in @xmath123 . in case of the dilute cloud , they carry information on the spatial distribution of the atoms in @xmath61 .",
    "the general problem is difficult to treat , and we focussed on three different limiting cases : a cloud of size smaller than the wave length , a dilute cloud where each scattered photon can be traced back to a single atom , and a large cloud of density larger than @xmath164 .",
    "both numerical simulations and analytical approach were carried out and we showed that scattering decreases the mean spin @xmath123 .",
    "although the physics is very different , the scattering gives rise to approximately the same optimum squeezing @xmath266 which is obtained by detecting the phase shift of a given number of photons , @xmath267 .",
    "we can not focus to better than within a wavelength , hence the optimum always exceeds the ideal results ( [ xiperf ] ) . in the case of a large cloud , @xmath257 is of the order of the area of the beam at the focus , and @xmath268 is limited by @xmath269 , where @xmath270 is the area of the cloud . in this case",
    "we can therefore rewrite the expression for @xmath128 @xmath271 where @xmath272 is the optical density of the cloud .",
    "thus for a dense cloud spin squeezing is possible , whereas for a very dilute cloud we recover the result that the possibility to know , for any scattered photon , which atom it comes , effectively prevents spin squeezing .",
    "a better squeezing could be achieved if the atomic cloud lie in an optical cavity so that a photon passes effectively @xmath273 times in average through the cloud , where @xmath273 is the finesse of the cavity . in particular",
    ", this would enable squeezing of a dilute cloud . to estimate the best possible squeezing in this case ,",
    "two opposit effects should be taken into account .",
    "first , the width in @xmath1 infered from the phase shift of the beam after the passage in the cavity is decreased by a factor @xmath273 compared to eq.[eq.dnaint ] .",
    "second , the probability that a photon is scattered before it leaves the cavity is also enhanced by @xmath273 so that the number of photons @xmath111 that can be used before @xmath123 decreases too much is also decreased by @xmath273 .",
    "but , as the width in @xmath1 induced by the phaseshift decreases only in @xmath274 , the best squeezing factor @xmath82 is still decreased by a factor @xmath275 compared to eq.[xifinal ] and could thus become smaller than 1 ."
