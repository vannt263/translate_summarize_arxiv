    "recent observations@xcite have been made of water bridges stretched across supports which are maintained at large voltage differences . a water bridge is a `` flexible cable '' made up of pure deionized water which has an electric field @xmath0 in virtue of an applied voltage across the supports at the ends of the fluid cable .",
    "previously to this work , it was not fully understood what forces hold up the water bridge against the force of gravity .",
    "it will here be shown that the forces responsible for holding up the water bridge follow from the maxwell electric field pressure tensor in dielectric polar fluids .",
    "in particular , the water bridge viewed as a flexible cable has an electric field induced tension sufficiently large so as to explain the water bridge support . in discussing the general theory of the pressure tensor for isotropic dielectric polar liquids , such as water , hydrostatics and adiabatic hydrodynamics shall also be explored .",
    "in sec.[thermo ] the thermodynamic laws applied to a fluid polar dielectric are described in detail .",
    "it is shown that in the presence of an electric field , there are two different thermodynamic pressures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these turn out to be eigenvalues of the full pressure tensor as discussed in sec.[press ] .",
    "if an infinitesimal surface area @xmath3 has a normal perpendicular to the electric field lines , then the pressure force is @xmath4 .",
    "if an infinitesimal surface area @xmath5 has a normal parallel to the electric field lines , then the pressure force is @xmath6 .",
    "it is shown that these results completely characterize the pressure tensor .    in sec.[cyl ] , we compute the tension in a fluid dielectric cylinder . the physics of that calculation is easily explained .",
    "consider a simple cylinder of length @xmath7 and cross sectional area @xmath8 .",
    "suppose that a spatially uniform electric field @xmath9 exists in a direction parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "since the tangential component of the electric field is continuous , the electric field inside the cylinder is the same as the electric field outside the cylinder . on the other hand ,",
    "the displacement field @xmath10 is discontinuous at the endpoints of the cylinder ; i.e. the ends of the cylinder have a charge density of @xmath11 wherein @xmath12 the end of the cylinder which is at the tail of the electric field vector has charge @xmath13 while the end of the cylinder which is at the arrow of the electric field vector has charge @xmath14 .",
    "the tension in the cylinder is then evidently given by @xmath15 which in virtue of eq.([intro1 ] ) reads @xmath16 e^2\\ . \\label{intro2}\\ ] ] in what follows , the stress eq.([intro2 ] ) will be rigorously derived from the maxwell pressure tensor within the cylinder .",
    "the ratio of the tension to cylinder weight , @xmath17 , obeys @xmath18 ,   \\label{intro3}\\ ] ] wherein @xmath19 and @xmath7 represent , respectively , the mass density and length of the cylinder .",
    "although we have employed free end boundary conditions to the cylinder , the tension @xmath20 is a local stress quantity independent of global boundary conditions . in sec.[hfc ] , we exhibit a plot of the hanging water bridge flexible cable for experimental values of the parameters in eq.([intro3 ] ) and find the agreement between theory and experiment to be satisfactory .    in sec.[efh ]",
    ", the hydrostatics of the dielectric fluid in an electric field is explored .",
    "the crucial quantity of interest is the mean isothermal polarization per molecule which obeys @xmath21 wherein @xmath22 is the mass of a single molecule and @xmath23 is the isothermal polarizability .",
    "for the water liquid and vapor phases , the molecular polarizabilities , respectively , obey @xmath24 .",
    "fluid dielectric films in strong electric fields adsorbed on insulating walls tend to swell to a large thickness . in sec.[eff ] , the theory of dielectric polar fluid bernoulli flows in strong electric fields is discussed .",
    "together with the effect of film thickening , it turns out that the film is capable of crawling up an insulating container wall against the force of gravity and flow as in a siphon over the top of the wall and down the other side . in the concluding sec.[conc ] , the role of bernoulli flows in forming water bridges will be discussed .",
    "analogies between dielectric polar liquid bernoulli flows in strong electric fields and quantum bernoulli flows in superfluids will be explored .",
    "these analogies include the ability of films to climb walls against gravitational forces and even to pass over the tops of these walls over to the other side .",
    "let @xmath25 represent the helmholtz free energy per unit volume for a dielectric fluid of mass density @xmath19 , temperature @xmath26 and maxwell displacement field @xmath27 ; @xmath28 wherein @xmath29 is the entropy per unit volume , @xmath30 is the chemical potential per unit mass and @xmath9 is the electric field .",
    "the thermodynamic pressure which follows from eq.([thermo1 ] ) , @xmath31 on the other hand , one may employ the free energy @xmath32 yielding the pressure @xmath33 the two different pressures obey @xmath34 for a dielectric fluid in an electric field , isotropy dictates that @xmath35 be parallel to @xmath0 even if the detailed equations of state are non - linear , i.e. isotropy yields a free energy of the form @xmath36 so that eqs.([thermo3 ] ) and ( [ thermo6 ] ) imply @xmath37 wherein @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the two possible fluid pressures in eq.([thermo5 ] ) obey @xmath39 it may at first glance appear strange that there are two physically different thermodynamic pressures in a dielectric fluid subject to an electric field .",
    "however , the situation may be clarified when it is realized that due to the electric field , the pressure is in reality a _",
    "in order to compute the maxwell pressure tensor in a fluid dielectric , imagine that the fluid undergoes a strain wherein a fluid particle at point @xmath40 is sent to the new point @xmath41 .",

    "it is now clear as to why there are two thermodynamic pressures , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in sec.[thermo ] . for an infinitesimal surface area @xmath3",
    "whose normal is perpendicular to the electric field lines , the pressure force is @xmath4 . for an infinitesimal surface area @xmath5",
    "whose normal is parallel to the electric field lines , the pressure force is @xmath6 .",
    "these results describe completely when to use the pressure @xmath1 and when to use the pressure @xmath2 .",
    "for a fluid dielectric cylinder of length @xmath7 and cross sectional area @xmath55 in a uniform electric field parallel to the axis , let us consider the work done in changing the volume @xmath56 via @xmath57 employing the pressure tensor eq.([press10 ] ) , one finds that both pressures , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are required @xmath60 when a fluid is stretched at constant volume @xmath61 @xmath62 the effective tension is thereby @xmath63 wherein eq.([thermo8 ] ) has been invoked .",
    "subtracting the tension that would be present for an electric field in the vacuum , @xmath64 , yields our final result for the tension , @xmath65 in agreement with eq.([intro2 ] ) of sec.[intro ] .",
    "the water bridge consists of a flexible fluid cable which can be suspended by its endpoints .",
    "there is a slight sag in the cable as befits the equilibrium of the total gravitational force @xmath66 downward and the total maxwell tension force @xmath67 upward wherein @xmath68 is the angle between the cable tangent at the support and the horizontal ; @xmath69 wherein eq.([intro3 ] ) has been invoked .",
    "eq.([hfc1 ] ) allows for the theoretical computation of @xmath70 in terms of experimental dielectric constants , mass densities , water bridge lengths and electric fields . with regard to the electric field ,",
    "one notes the _ exact _ conversion between the gaussian units here employed and the usual engineering units , @xmath71 the agreement between theory and experiment in predicting the slight hang of the water bridge as a flexible cable , as in the above fig.[fig1 ] , is satisfactory .",
    "the force density on the fluid as described by the pressure tensor eq.([press10 ] ) is given by @xmath72 within the bulk liquid @xmath73 so that eq.([efh1 ] ) thereby reads @xmath74 on the other hand , from the gibbs - duhem eq.([thermo4 ] ) under equilibrium isothermal conditions @xmath75 , @xmath76 so that the force per unit volume can be computed from the chemical potential per unit mass ; i.e. @xmath77 under a newtonian gravitational field @xmath78 one finds the total force density equilibrium condition @xmath79 yielding the uniform chemical potential condition @xmath80={\\rm const . } \\label{efh7}\\ ] ] to compute the electric field dependence of the chemical potential per unit mass , one may apply a maxwell relation to the thermodynamic eq.([thermo3 ] ) which reads @xmath81 wherein the mean molecular dipole moment @xmath82 defines the polarizability @xmath23 as in eq.([intro4 ] ) . integrating eq.([efh8 ] ) completes the calculation of the chemical potential @xmath83 the central eq.([efh9 ] ) of this section implies that the chemical potential is lowered when strong electric fields are applied .",
    "it follows from eq.([efh9 ] ) that the application of an electric field lowers the chemical potential of films of water adsorbed on insulating substrates such as glass which is often employed in physical chemistry experiments .",
    "when the chemical potential of a liquid film is lowered , the water film thickness increases ; e.g. in the presence of electric fields , water in a glass beaker will have a film which appears to climb higher up the walls than would be possible in the zero electric field case .",
    "the fabrication of a water bridge begins by applying a potential difference across the water contained in two neighboring glass beakers which just touch each other .",
    "one expects and finds experimentally a thickening film layer all around the points at which the water horizontal surfaces meet the two beaker walls .",
    "the water climbs the walls of both beakers and near the touch point of the beakers splashes over the tops .",
    "when the hydrostatic calm after the splash begins , a bridge is formed at the point wherein the beakers just touch .",
    "a longer water bridge is formed after slowly separating the beakers .",
    "let us now turn to the hydrodynamic features of the polar liquid flows in a strong electric field .",
    "we here employ the usual notion of a fluid derivative operator , @xmath84 which expresses the time rate of change operator as seen by an observer moving locally with the fluid velocity @xmath85 .",
    "for example , mass conservation reads@xcite @xmath86 bernoulli flows are adiabatic , i.e. viscous entropy production is ignored .",
    "conservation of energy then amounts to a local _ entropy _ conservation law@xcite @xmath87 wherein @xmath29 is the entropy per unit volume . from eqs.([eff1 ] ) and ( [ eff2 ] ) it follows that @xmath88 which implies a conservation law for the entropy per unit mass @xmath89 it is here that the enthalpy per unit mass @xmath90 makes it s way into the adiabatic polar dielectric liquid bernoulli flows in an electric field ; @xmath91 wherein eq.([thermo4 ] ) has been invoked . for an adiabatic flow with @xmath92 as in eq.([eff5 ] ) , eq.([eff6 ] ) implies @xmath93 thus , the maxwell pressure tensor force per unit volume eq.([efh2 ] ) in an adiabatic bernoulli flow reads @xmath94 the dynamical equation of motions which accounts for momentum conservation then becomes @xmath95 wherein the gravitational field eq.([efh5 ] ) has been taken into account .",
    "vorticity @xmath96 makes an appearance in virtue of the acceleration identities @xmath97 which allow us to write eq.([eff9 ] ) as @xmath98 employing the curl of eq.([eff12 ] ) and using eq.([eff10 ] ) implies the equation of motion for vorticity .",
    "it is @xmath99 if at a given initial time the bernoulli flow is irrotational , i.e. @xmath100 , then at all later times in accordance with eq.([eff13 ] ) the flow will remain irrotational .",
    "eq.([eff12 ] ) then reads@xcite @xmath101 the complete set of equations for a steady state bernoulli flow in a strong electrostatic field @xmath0 and in a uniform gravitational field @xmath102 in the negative z - direction then follows from eq.([eff14 ] ) as @xmath103 the only difference between the normal steady state bernoulli fluid flows in eq.([eff15 ] ) and the usual case for @xmath104 resides in the electric field contributions to the enthalpy per unit mass @xmath90 .",
    "it is here useful to introduce a new thermodynamic potential per unit mass @xmath105 obeying @xmath106    for an adiabatic @xmath107 incompressible @xmath108 steady state bernoulli flow , eqs.([eff15 ] ) , ( [ eff16 ] ) and ( [ eff17 ] ) imply the central result of this section @xmath109 in the case that @xmath110 , the bernoulli eq.([eff2 ] ) indicates that water under the influence of gravity alone flows down a wall and may splash at the bottom . on the other hand ,",
    "if the electric field on the bottom of the wall is negligible and the electric field on top of wall is large , then a polar dielectric fluid can crawl up a wall and may splash at the top .",
    "such top splash processes on both of two beakers has been a precursor for building a water bridge .",
    "water subject to high electric fields can sustain structures that are more than just a bit unusual .",
    "an electric field directed parallel to the water cylinder axis can create a tension as in a stretched rubber band but with different causes . in the case of the rubber band ,",
    "the tension arises from the high entropy of random knotted polymer chains . in a polar liquid",
    "the tension arises out of long ordered chains of low entropy aligned coherent dipolar domains @xcite .",
    "the resulting tension in the water bridge sustains a siphon tube between two beakers without the requirement that a new external siphon tube structure of other materials be introduced .",
    "we shall conclude with some close analogies between a polar dielectric fluid , such as water , and a quantum superfluid such as liquid @xmath111 . in the liquid @xmath111 superfluid case",
    ", it is known that the superfluid film can act similarly to a siphon in which the film climbs over the wall and down the other side of the wall until the lowest possible gravitational energy is achieved .",
    "similar flows can be induced in water by the application of high electric fields . in both cases ,",
    "the flows are carried with little entropy production , although in the case of deionized water there is a mild ohmic heating due to the transport of a few remaining ions .    finally ,",
    "when the vorticity @xmath112 becomes important@xcite , as in the boundary layer between the wall and the bernoulli flow , one may expect quantum vortex lines in water with the circulation condition@xcite @xmath113 .",
    "the reasoning is that in a coherent liquid flow , the velocity potential @xmath114 in eq.([eff14 ] ) determines the phase factor @xmath115 $ ] in the many body fluid wave functions .",
    "this quite general connection between the bernoulli flow eq.([eff14 ] ) and the quantum mechanical phase is not self evident@xcite . for this reason we have placed the mathematical details of the proof in the attached appendix[flow ] .",
