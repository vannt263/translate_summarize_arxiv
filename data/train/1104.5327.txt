    "modern ultrasound systems utilize an array of transducer elements in a process known as beamforming  @xcite .",
    "an imaging cycle begins when modulated acoustic pulses are transmitted from some or all array elements .",
    "specific delays are applied to the transmitting elements , such that the interfering waves form a narrow beam , along which most energy propagates . as the energy propagates , the beam gets narrower , until reaching the focal point , after which it expands . determining the position of the focal point is achieved by applying appropriate delays to the transmitting elements .    as the focused energy propagates along the tissue , echoes are scattered and reflected by density and propagation velocity perturbations @xcite .",
    "the array elements detect the reflected energy .",
    "a second beamforming process is then performed , aimed at localizing the reflecting elements , while at the same time improving signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "this beamforming process is performed by summing delayed samples of the received data . for that purpose ,",
    "high rate a / d conversion must be first carried out at each of the receiving channels .",
    "actually , optimizing the image resolution requires that each receiving channel will be sampled at 3 - 5 times the center frequency of the modulated pulse @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , let us consider a b - mode scan , in which the central frequency of the transducer may vary in between @xmath0 , depending on the use@xcite .",
    "advanced composite materials , often used in the transducer , can attain a relative bandwidth in excess of 100% .",
    "therefore , if we assume a nominal center frequency of @xmath1 , we end up with a baseband bandwidth of approximately @xmath2 . confined to the classic nyquist - shannon sampling theorem  @xcite , where the only prior on the signal is that it is bandlimited",
    ", this implies that standard ultrasound devices must sample the analog signal received in each active element at a typical rate of at least @xmath3 .",
    "recent works  @xcite show that , by exploiting other priors regarding the signal structure , it is possible to design more efficient sampling schemes , which actually break through the nyquist barrier . decreasing the sampling rate is of vast interest , as it may obviously be manifested in reduction of machinery size and power consumption .    in their recent work , tur , eldar and friedman",
    "@xcite first proposed to implement these ideas in ultrasound imaging .",
    "they suggested to regard the signal received in each of the array transducer elements as having finite rate of innovation ( fri)@xcite . more specifically , they assume each such signal comprises at most @xmath4 replicas of a known - shape pulse , all received within the time interval @xmath5 . delay and gain parameters",
    "are associated with each replica , such that the entire problem may be characterized by @xmath6 degrees of freedom .",
    "they then developed a new sub - nyquist sampling technique that exploits this structure , in order to reduce the sampling rate way beyond that which is used in standard ultrasound devices , dictated by the classic nyquist - shannon sampling theorem .",
    "tur , eldar and friedman s work follows the spirit of analog compressed sensing , also referred to as xampling  @xcite .",
    "the latter is an emerging framework , which combines classic methods from sampling theory together with recent developments in compressed sensing , aimed at sampling analog signals far below the nyquist rate . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the term xampling whenever referring to the sub - nyquist sampling schemes purposed in ref .  , and in later work by gedalyahu , tur and eldar  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , though , that both these schemes are special cases of xampling , in which the signal s fri property is exploited in order to achieve the goal of sub - nyquist sampling .",
    "the xampling scheme suggested by tur , eldar and friedman  @xcite comprises the following steps : first , the received signal is filtered using the compactly supported sum of sincs kernel .",
    "the filtered signal is then sampled at nearly the rate of innovation , namely the number of unknown parameters @xmath6 , which is much smaller than the nyquist rate of the pulse .",
    "the extracted samples are used for computing a finite set of fourier coefficients , which correspond to the @xmath7-periodic extension of the received signal .",
    "having obtained the finite set of fourier coefficients , spectral analysis techniques , similar to these presented by vetterli et al .",
    "@xcite , are utilized , in order to estimate the set of unknown delays and amplitudes characterizing the reflected pulses .",
    "whereas tur , eldar and friedman@xcite adopt a filtering and sampling approach as a preliminary step for obtaining the required set of fourier coefficients , gedalyahu , tur and eldars@xcite later work suggests a second approach for obtaining the same coefficients : the single filtering and sampling channel is replaced by a bank of modulators and integrators .",
    "both approaches are aimed at minimal rate sampling of a * single * received channel .    referring to an array of transducer elements utilized in the ultrasound imaging device , by processing the signal received in each channel separately ( using either approach )",
    ", one may obtain a corresponding set of delays and amplitudes from low - rate samples .",
    "the sets obtained from all receiving elements may then be combined ( via some geometric interpretation ) , in order to estimate the two - dimensional coordinates of the reflecting elements .",
    "note , however , that such schemes can not achieve the snr improvement which is an integral part of standard beamforming techniques ; this is because the correlation between signals received in different channels is not exploited throughout the process of extracting the parameters ( pulse amplitudes and delays ) from each signal . more explicitly , the xampling schemes proposed in refs .   and",
    "both aim at accurately detecting strong , localized pulses , related with macroscopic perturbations . however , the actual signals received by the array elements also contain components which , in the context of our work , may be regarded as noise .",
    "actually , part of these noisy components arises from constructive and destructive interference of acoustic waves reflected from dense , subwavelength scatterers in the tissue ( these are typically manifested as granular texture in the ultrasound image , called `` speckle '' , after a similar effect in laser optics@xcite ) .",
    "apparently , these noisy components induce erroneous results when xampling the received signals .",
    "if we wish to obtain meaningful results by either xampling scheme , while maintaining a rather low oversampling factor , the overall snr improvement is indeed a crucial step .",
    "this paper is aimed at generalizing the schemes of refs .   and   to multiple antenna arrays .",
    "our goal is to obtain a two - dimensional , focused ultrasound image , corresponding to strong perturbations in the scanned plane , while reducing the sampling rate in each active element , by a factor of 10 - 15 times relative to the rate used in standard ultrasound devices .",
    "furthermore , we aim at achieving this goal in the presence of noise in the received signals . in such case ,",
    "straightforward implementation of either schemes of refs .   or   on each channel",
    "independently , would require hard thresholding ( which in turn cancels / attenuates desired pulses ) and/or increasing the oversampling factor , such that the final sampling rate grows towards the nyquist rate .",
    "our xampling scheme s most expensive computational component regards the extraction of the pulses delays and amplitudes from the set of low rate samples . referring to standard ultrasound devices , this component substitutes both the hilbert transform , which is applied throughout the process of envelope detection@xcite , and the expensive beamforming computations , namely : summing samples obtained at nyquist rate from all active elements .",
    "in addition , referring to straightforward implementation of either systems of refs .   or   on each channel separately , our scheme extracts the pulses parameters once per image line , rather than once per active element participating in the image line generation ( which equivalently means tens of times per image line , depending on the number of active elements used for beamforming ) .",
    "the xampling system we propose may be summarized as follows : let us assume that we could somehow generate the beamformed signal , corresponding to a single image line , in the analog domain .",
    "assuming that such a signal maintains the fri property of the received signals from which it was constructed , we may xample it using the scheme suggested by either ref .   or  , yielding the delays and amplitudes of pulses along the final beamformed image line . by mathematically formulating the process of xampling the beamformed signal using the scheme suggested in ref .  , and",
    "then applying several algebraic manipulations to this formulation , we end up with a new set of generalized modulation kernels .",
    "the latter may now be applied directly to the analog signals which are received in each of the active elements , thus bypassing the impractical step of actually generating the beamformed signal in the analog domain .    due to space limitation ,",
    "the following paper is not aimed at presenting a rigorous review of our results . instead",
    ", we present an outline of our approach , and preliminary results obtained using actual ultrasound data . the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec:02 ] briefly outlines principles of standard ultrasound imaging , namely the process of beamforming in both polar and linear scan methods , applying dynamic receive ( rx ) focus .",
    "section [ sec:03 ] reviews the one - dimensional xampling scheme suggested by refs .   and  .",
    "in section [ sec:04 ] we present our system , which combines the concepts of beamforming with those of one - dimensional xampling .",
    "section [ sec:05 ] provides results obtained by applying our xampling scheme upon actual ultrasound data . in this section",
    "we also analyze the reduction in the necessary amount of samples , and the way this affects the overall computational cost .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ sec:06 ] .",
    "this section is aimed at outlining the method by which an ultrasound image is generated using a linear array of transducer elements .",
    "our discussion refers mainly to b - mode scan , in which the array simultaneously scans a plane through the body , resulting in a two - dimensional image , which may be viewed on screen .",
    "we are specifically interested in the process carried out by the electronic beamformer , in which multiple signals , received from a set of receivers , are focused into a single trace , known as the beamformed signal .",
    "the latter is envelope detected , forming a single image line .",
    "the analysis reviewed throughout this section is based mainly on ref .  .",
    "an ultrasound image consists of roughly 100 lines .",
    "each line is generated throughout a single transmit - receive cycle .",
    "in such a cycle , a set of active elements first transmits acoustic pulses , modulated to central frequency of @xmath8 to @xmath9 , depending on the use .",
    "an appropriate delay is applied to the pulse transmitted from each transducer element , aimed at obtaining constructive interference at a specific point in the plane , referred to as the focal point .",
    "the interfering acoustic waves form an acoustic pulse , which propagates along a narrow beam ( containing most of the transmitted energy ) .",
    "the beam gets narrower , until reaching the focal point , after which it expands .",
    "the velocity at which the pulse propagates will be denoted by @xmath10 , and varies between @xmath11 ( fat ) to @xmath12 ( spleen ) .",
    "an average value of @xmath13 is assumed by scanners for processing purposes . as the transmitted pulse propagates inside the tissue , it encounters density and propagation - velocity perturbations .",
    "these cause scattered and reflected echoes , which are detected by the array elements . applying the acoustic reciprocity theorem  @xcite ,",
    "a second beamforming process is now carried out , in which the received signals are combined into a single trace , which in a sense , visualizes structures in the tissue , along the transmitted beam .",
    "modern ultrasound devices typically handle 64 to 192 transducer elements in the beamforming process .",
    "we emphasize , that combining the received signals is performed in the digital domain , implying that modern ultrasound devices must first sample the signal received in each of the active elements at the nyquist rate ( typically @xmath3 ) . refs .   and  , introduced an approach , which allowed reconstruction of the analog signal detected by an individual transducer element from a very low number of samples .",
    "in contrast , our generalized scheme is aimed at obtaining the low rate samples from all active elements , in a manner which will enable to directly reconstruct the beamformed signal .",
    "this is further discussed in section  [ sec:04 ] .",
    "we would now like to formulate the manner in which the beamformer combines the signals received in all active elements into a single trace , known as the beamformed signal , and better understand the significance of the latter .",
    "this formulation applies to conventional ultrasound imaging , and will be necessary when we translate our theoretical scheme of xampling the beamformed signal , into an applicable scheme where the signals received in the active transducer elements are sampled directly .",
    "referring to figure  [ fig:01 ] , we examine the two - dimensional plane xz in which @xmath14 elements are aligned along the @xmath15 axis ( the center of the array coincides with the origin ) .",
    "we analyze one cycle , in which a single image line is constructed .",
    "the image line corresponds to a beam located within the xz plane , emerging from the array center .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 , the angle between the beam and @xmath17 axis ( normal to the array ) .",
    "the cycle begins , when each active element transmits a single modulated pulse , such that the interference pattern may be observed as a concentrated pulse of energy , propagating along the beam .",
    "we regard the pulse as if it was transmitted from the array center , at a known time , which we shall define as @xmath18 . knowing the speed",
    "in which the pulse propagates ( denoted by @xmath10 , and assumed @xmath13 ) , we may now estimate the distance which it traveled along the beam by the time instance @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 , and thereby its two - dimensional position , @xmath21 : @xmath22^t ~r\\left(t_n\\right)=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll } \\mbox{cos}\\alpha &   \\mbox{sin}\\alpha \\end{array}\\right]^tct_n.\\ ] ]      since the distance from @xmath21 to each of the active elements varies , each element will detect the reflected pulse at a different time instance .",
    "namely , the time at which the pulse arrives at the @xmath25th receiver , positioned at @xmath26 , is given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the @xmath29 coordinate of the receiving element .",
    "let us denote by @xmath30 , the analog signal detected by the active element indexed @xmath25 .",
    "beamforming is now achieved by shifting each of the received signals @xmath30 , in order to compensate for the time difference @xmath31 , and then summing the shifted versions .",
    "the acoustic reciprocity theorem  @xcite implies that when we sum the shifted signals , constructive interference will occur at @xmath32 , providing that an echo was indeed reflected from @xmath21 at time @xmath19 .",
    "denoting by @xmath33 the sum of the delayed signals , we are thus interested in the value which @xmath33 obtains at @xmath34 .      summarizing the above , we have : @xmath36 which corresponds to the intensity of a reflection originating at time @xmath19 , from the coordinate @xmath21 . for purposes of convenience",
    ", we will finally substitute @xmath37 , obtaining an expression for the beamformed signal : @xmath38 referring to  ( [ e:01 ] ) , our last substitution implies that @xmath33 represents the intensity of a reflection originating at time @xmath39 from a point distanced @xmath40 from the origin , along the transmitted beam .",
    "the assumption is that the transmitted pulse indeed intersected this point at @xmath39 , and was possibly scattered .",
    "@xmath33 is obviously the result of varying the receive focal point along time , and its construction is therefore referred to as  dynamic focusing \" .",
    "we note that , instead of obtaining the beamformed signal using dynamic focusing process , beamformers sometimes divide the image line into @xmath41 segments , called focal zones , such that an entire segment of @xmath33 , corresponding to the @xmath42th focal zone , is constructed using a single set of delays ( one delay per element ) .",
    "the set is obtained using  ( [ e:04 ] ) , which is calculated for a single , representative point within the focal zone .    in this section ,",
    "we have formulated the manner in which the beamformer combines the signals received in the transducer elements , @xmath43 into a beamformed signal , @xmath33 , through the process of dynamic focusing . the dynamically focused , beamformed signal , may now be used in order to generate a single image line .",
    "the beamformer performs the computation formulated in  ( [ e:06 ] ) in the digital domain , using samples obtained from each of the transducer elements at the nyquist rate .",
    "our goal is to retrieve a set of parameters from which the beamformed signal @xmath33 formulated in  ( [ e:06 ] ) may be reconstructed , by sampling the received signals far below the nyquist rate .",
    "we achieve this by exploiting an approximately fri structure characterizing @xmath33 , within the xampling methods of refs .   and  , which are outlined in the next section .    throughout the rest of this paper , we will limit ourselves to the case of linear scan , in which all beams are parallel to the @xmath17 axis .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath44 in  ( [ e:06 ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 now represents the distance between the @xmath25th receiver and the beam processed at the current cycle .",
