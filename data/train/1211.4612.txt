    "sn 1987a in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is one of those vexing examples of murphy s law , where the nearest and best - studied supernova ( sn ) in modern times also appears unique when compared to the population of known extragalactic core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "it is an oddball , consisting of a peculiar sn type having a slow rise to peak , attributed to the relatively compact nature of its ( also unusual and unexpected ) blue - supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor ( arnett 1987 , 1989 ; arnett et al .",
    "sn  1987a is the only sn near enough to obtain a clear picture of its spatially resolved circumstellar nebula , but its bizarre triple - ring nebula still defies adequate explanation ( luo & mccray 1991 ; blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ; collins et al .  1999 ; morris & podsiadlowski 2009 ) , and does not conform to the hourglass structures commonly seen in bipolar planetary nebulae and bipolar nebulae around massive stars .    there are , however , a few objects known that appear similar to sn  1987a in that they have prominent equatorial ring nebulae with bipolar lobes or rings surrounding bsg central stars . in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed study of the recently discovered ring nebula sbw1 ( smith et al .",
    "two other known bipolar ring nebulae around massive stars are hd  168625 and sher  25 , which are discussed in detail elsewhere ( smith 2007 ; brandner et al .",
    "1997 ) . of these three",
    ", sbw1 appears to most closely resemble the nebula around sn  1987a and the physical parameters of its progenitor star .",
    "before massive stars explode as sne , they can shed considerable mass as they attempt to remove their outer h - rich envelope .",
    "if they fail to shed their h envelopes , they will typically remain as red supergiants ( rsgs ) and will die as sne of type ii .",
    "one expects single stars in the lower initial mass ranges of core - collapse sne ( 820m@xmath5 ) to retain their h envelopes and explode as rsgs , and this expectation is largely confirmed by pre - explosion detections of progenitor stars of sne  ii - p ( e.g. , smartt 2009 ; leonard 2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "sn  1987a challenged our view of stellar evolution because it was a sn  ii from an explosion of a bsg , not a rsg , with an initial mass of 1820m@xmath5 ( see arnett et al.1989 , and references therein ) .",
    "the reason that the progenitor was a bsg is still unclear , but various scenarios involving close binary evolution , binary mergers , rapid rotation , and enhanced mass loss have been suggested .",
    "pre - explosion data for sn1987a s progenitor star sk@xmath969@xmath10202 establish that it appeared to be a fairly normal b3  i supergiant ( walborn et al .",
    "1989 ; rousseau et al .  1978 ) .",
    "therefore , our conjectures about the progenitor and its pre - sn mass loss depend heavily on studies of the remarkable ring nebula surrounding the sn , made famous in early _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images ( e.g. , plait et al .  1995 ; burrows et al .",
    "kinematic studies of the nebula s expansion indicate that it was ejected by the progenitor star roughly @xmath11yr before exploding as a sn ( meaburn et al .",
    "1995 ; crotts & heathcote 2000 ) . the ejection and shaping mechanisms of this nebula are intimately linked to the star s peculiar evolution just before explosion , but our understanding of that process is still tenuous . the poor understanding of how the ring nebula formed has become a more pressing problem in recent years .",
    "we are now lucky enough to witness a spectacular collision as the blast wave of the sn overtakes the ring nebula ejected by the progenitor , predicted shortly after the discovery of the nebula ( luo & mccray 1991 ) .",
    "the sn  1987a blast wave first began to collide with the dense circumstellar ring in 1997 , heralded by the appearance of new `` hot spots '' in the ring ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1998 ; michael et al .  1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "these hotspots had broader line widths than the rest of the ring , confirming that they were bright because a shock was being driven into the dense clumps .",
    "these clumps were thought to be the ends of long `` fingers '' created by rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instabilities at the contact discontinuity between the slow rsg wind and the fast bsg wind .",
    "since the hotspots first appeared in 1997 , many more spots have brightened all around the ring ( sugerman et al.2002 ) , although the hotspots have not yet merged into a contiguous bright ring as one might expect when the blast wave catches up to gas in between the r - t fingers .    in the decade between explosion and the start of this collision with the ring , the blast wave was expanding through the relatively low - density region interior to the ring .",
    "radio emission and hydrodynamic models suggest that the bsg wind had a surprisingly low mass - loss rate of @xmath12m@xmath5yr@xmath13 ( stavely - smith et al .  1993 ; blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ; chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) .",
    "the expansion rate of the blast wave through this low - density progenitor wind was fast at first , but then slowed ( gaensler et al .",
    "2000 ) , attributed to the shock running into a higher - density h  ii region caused by photoionised material from the dense rsg wind ( chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ; meyer 1997 ) . while the existence of this h  ii region can account for some observed characteristics of the blast - wave expansion , emission from this feature itself was not directly observed before it was hit by the blast wave .",
    "one of the key results from our analysis below is that such a feature is seen directly in the similar nebula around sbw1 .",
    ".new observations of sbw1 [ cols=\"<,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sed ]     and @xmath14 magnitudes ( asterisks ) are from table 1 of smith et al .",

    "unfilled diamonds , triangles , and squares show catalog photometry from wise ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22@xmath3 m ) , msx ( 8.3 , 12.1 , 14.7 , and 21.3@xmath3 m ) , and akari ( 9 and 18@xmath3 m ) , respectively . these all represent the spatially unresolved total flux of the star and nebula .",
    "the filled blue dots represent photometry of the entire object from our _ spitzer _ irac and mips data , whereas the blue asterisks represent the measured flux of the central star in the irac images in bands 13 .",
    "finally , the orange vertical bars represent the flux of the central star in our 8.8 and 11.7@xmath3 m t - recs images , where we measured the fraction of the total flux contributed by the central point source and then scaled the total flux to match the sed ( the images were obtained in some nonphotometric conditions ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows a @xmath16 21,000k blackbody , representative of the unreddened b1.5  iab supergiant .",
    "the three thick grey curves are this stellar blackbody reddened by @xmath17mag , plus two grey bodies ( emissivity @xmath18 ) representing thermal emission from dust at approximately 190k and 85k .",
    "the solid black curve is the total flux contributed by the sum of these three components.,width=316 ]      figure  [ fig : sed ] shows the sed of sbw1 from optical through ir wavelengths using data from several sources .",
    "we obtained publically available ir photometry of sbw1 from the infrared science archive ( irsa ) , including measurements from 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , and from point - source catalogs of the midcourse space experiment ( msx ; price 1995 ) , wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; wright et al .",
    "2010 ) , and akari satellites . flux densities ( in jy ) from these sources are listed in table  [ tab : sed ] , and then converted to @xmath19 in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "we also show @xmath20- and @xmath14-band photometry from smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed ] and table  [ tab : sed ] include photometry measured from our _ spitzer _ irac and mips surveys of the carina nebula ( smith et al .",
    "filled blue circles in figure  [ fig : sed ] correspond to total fluxes of sbw1 measured in a 12-radius circular aperture in all 5 bands , while blue asterisks are the stellar flux in bands 1 , 2 , and 3 measured in a 3-radius aperture with corrections for point - spread function ( psf ) flux outside this radius .",
    "lastly , the long vertical red / orange bars in figure  [ fig : sed ] are derived from the fraction of the total flux contributed by the central star in our 8.8 and 11.7@xmath3 m t - recs images of sbw1 from gemini south . the upper end of these bars is tied to the solid - curve fit to the sed ( see below ) , and the bottom of each then represents the expected stellar flux at each wavelength .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] , the observed optical and ir photometry of sbw1 can be approximated reasonably well with three simple emission components : ( 1 ) a 21,000k blackbody corresponding to the b1.5  iab central star ( dashed curve ) , reddened by foreground extinction of @xmath17mag , ( 2 ) a greybody ( with an emissivity proportional to @xmath21 at long wavelengths ) representing warm dust at 190k , and ( 3 ) another greybody representing cooler dust at 85k . at a distance of 7kpc ,",
    "these stellar - photosphere , hot - dust , and cool - dust components have luminosities of 50,000l@xmath5 , 400l@xmath5 , and 2500l@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "photometric information for the unresolved central star is consistent with reddened photospheric emission at all wavelengths up to @xmath22@xmath3 m .",
    "there is no evidence for thermal free - free emission from an extended wind photosphere ( e.g. , wright & barlow 1979 ) at these wavelengths , implying a rather weak stellar wind from this b  1.5  iab supergiant .",
    "the uncertainty suggests that the free - free stellar wind emission at @xmath23@xmath3 m is less than about 10% of the stellar flux , which in turn is 0.51% of the total observed flux from sbw1 .",
    "this would correspond to a flux density of roughly 0.51mjy or less at 10@xmath3 m for any stellar - wind emission . using this ir flux and a distance of 7kpc in equation ( 45 ) of puls et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we find a likely upper limit to the central star s mass - loss rate of    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the terminal speed of the bsg wind in units of 300kms@xmath13 , @xmath26 is the 10@xmath3 m flux density in mjy ( the relevant flux is 0.51 mjy ) , and @xmath27 is the distance relative to 7kpc . this upper limit of @xmath28 ( 24 ) @xmath29m@xmath5yr@xmath13 for",
    "the mass - loss rate of the central blue supergiant star of sbw1 could be a factor of a few lower if the likely effects of clumping are included . in any case , this upper limit is in good agreement with upper limits to the mass - loss rate of sn  1987a s progenitor of ( 1.53 ) @xmath29m@xmath5yr@xmath13 inferred from hydrodynamic simulations of the nebula ( blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ) and an estimated mass - loss rate of @xmath30m@xmath5yr@xmath13 inferred from the observed expansion rate of the radio photosphere ( chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) .",
    "the sharp increase in total flux from 6 to 8@xmath3 m , as the sed transitions from a photosphere to warm - dust emission , is indicative of a cavity with little or no dust close to the star .",
    "the 190k `` hot''-dust component dominates the total flux from about 6 to 15@xmath3 m , and arises from the diffuse structures filling the interior of the ring , as seen in the double - peaked feature in the 8.8 and 11.7@xmath3 m images from gemini south ( figure  [ fig : trecs ] ) .",
    "the cooler 85k dust component dominates the total flux longward of about 18@xmath3 m , and this cooler dust appears to reside primarily in the equatorial ring .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of some cooler dust that may produce excess far - ir luminosity ( and much higher mass ) from presently available data .",
    "one can calculate the approximate mass of dust grains required to emit each of these two components by making some simplifying assumptions about the grain - emissivity properties , and taking the mid - ir emission to be optically thin . following smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the total mass of emitting dust can be expressed as    @xmath31    where ( @xmath32 ) is a quantity that describes the grain - emission efficiency @xmath33 ( see draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "we assume a distance @xmath34kpc for sbw1 , and astronomical silicate with a typical grain density @xmath35g@xmath36 ( at these wavelengths the assumed grain radius is not critical as long as the typical grains are less than @xmath37@xmath3 m ) . with these parameters",
    "we derive dust masses of @xmath38m@xmath5 and @xmath39m@xmath5 for the @xmath40k and 85k components of the sed in figure  [ fig : sed ] , respectively .",
    "the typical uncertainty for this type of rough estimate of the dust mass is @xmath41% , dominated by assumptions about grain properties , as well as uncertainties in the ranges of temperatures that can fit the sed .",
    "we have assumed astronomical silicate as the nominal dust composition , which seems the most reasonable given that sbw1 is a massive evolved star with normal cno chemical abundances ( smith et al .",
    "moreover , ir spectra of sn  1987a obtained with _ spitzer",
    "_ revealed strong silicate emission features ( bouchet et al .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have direct observational constraints on the grain composition in sbw1 .",
    "had we instead adopted the assumption of small ( @xmath42@xmath3 m ) graphite grains and calculated the dust mass following the method described by smith & gehrz ( 2005 ) , we would have derived dust masses of @xmath43m@xmath5 and @xmath44m@xmath5 for the @xmath40k and 85k components , respectively .",
    "the mass for the warmer component agrees within the expected uncertainty with that derived above for silicates .",
    "the cooler component is a factor of @xmath45 larger for carbon grains , but as noted above , carbon grain composition seems unlikely since sbw1 is not c - enriched . in any case",
    ", we regard the value of @xmath46m@xmath5 as a lower limit to the possible dust mass , since our observations do not constrain the sed longward of 24@xmath3 m , making it possible that a larger mass of cooler ( @xmath47k ) dust might reside in the equatorial ring , or just outside it .    to extend this dust mass to a total nebular",
    "mass requires an assumption of the gas - to - dust mass ratio , which is poorly constrained but generally taken to be about 100:1 in massive - star nebulae ( see , e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "we thus infer a total gas mass of order 0.51m@xmath5 for the ring nebula around sbw1 , derived from the mass of the coolest dust we detect .",
    "although the gas : dust ratio could be substantially larger for the hotter 190k dust component that is mixed with ionised gas in the interior region of the ring , this component makes a negligible contribution to the total nebular mass .",
    "interestingly , a mass of order 0.51m@xmath5 for the sbw1 ring nebula is about equal to the mass of pre - sn ejecta surrounding sn  1987a .",
    "the directly observed mass of ionised gas in the sn  1987a ring is at least 0.04m@xmath5 , although this is a lower limit to the nebula mass because it is derived from emission lines and corresponds only to a thin skin at the inward - facing edge of the ring that was ionised by the sn ; observations of light echoes reveal a much larger mass of material in the ring and outside it of @xmath48m@xmath5 ( sugerman et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the cool - dust component that dominates the @xmath49 m emission has a total luminosity that is @xmath50% of the original stellar luminosity .",
    "the vertical thickness of the dust in the equatorial ring must therefore be @xmath23% of its radius , or @xmath51 cm , based on the fraction of the total luminosity that it intercepts .",
    "the much lower luminosity of the hot - dust component , despite its closer separation from the central star , means that it is very optically thin , and so its relative luminosity can not provide a meaningful constraint on the vertical thickness of this hot - dust component .      the carina nebula was observed as part of a large program with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , called the _",
    "carina complex project ( townsley et al .",
    "there is no x - ray source listed in the resulting catalog of x - ray sources in this survey ( broos et al .",
    "2011 ) within a radius of 15 from sbw1 s position .",
    "the quoted completeness limit of this survey would suggest an absorption - corrected upper limit to the x - ray luminosity of @xmath52ergs@xmath53 for sources within the carina nebula region .",
    "it is , however , difficult to place a meaningful upper limit on the intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity of sbw1 , since it is located at a distance of 7kpc , far behind the carina nebula ( @xmath54kpc ; smith 2006 ) .",
    "thus , there could be a large absorption column , and its intrinsic soft x - ray luminosity could be substantially higher than this nominal upper limit .",
    "a displayed in blue / green , and the t - recs 11.7@xmath3 m image from figure  [ fig : trecs]c displayed in red / orange.,width=307 ]",
    "figure  [ fig : color ] shows the relative spatial distribution of ionised gas and warm dust in colour , with the h@xmath1 image tinted as blue / green and the mid - ir emission tinted as red / orange .",
    "this image encapsulates the basic multiwavelength structure of sbw1 , and is useful in the discussion below .",
    "one of the curious things about figure  [ fig : color ] is that it runs counter to normal expectations that dusty regions will be farther from the source of radiation than the ionised gas .",
    "this and other issues are clarified below .      the new _ hst_/wfc3 images in h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] provide a detailed view of the morphology in the ring nebula around sbw1 . to the extent that sbw1 is a suitable analog ,",
    "these images also provide our best view of the circumstellar environment around an object like sn  1987a .",
    "the most prominent feature in the images is a thin ring of emission , presumably in the equatorial plane .",
    "the new _ hst _ images also provide a better view of the outer rings or hourglass structure in sbw1 , and they clarify the nature of the diffuse emission structures in the ring s interior , closer to the central star . below we examine the structure of the ring in detail , and then conduct a comparison with the equatorial ring of sn  1987a .",
    "structures inside the ring are discussed in the following section .",
    "in general , the equatorial ring around sbw1 appears as a fragmented chain of clumps or filaments with a thin radial extent .",
    "filaments in the ring are marginally resolved with a thickness of @xmath8 0@xmath551 , or 0.0034pc at a distance of 7kpc . by assuming this as a typical thickness for the ionised emitting layer",
    ", we can provide a rough estimate of the density of ionised gas in the ring from the h@xmath1 emission measure , @xmath56 .",
    "this can be conveniently expressed ( see smith et al .",
    "2010a ) as    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the h@xmath1 line intensity measured in our narrow - band f656n wfc3 image in units of @xmath59ergs@xmath13cm@xmath53arcsec@xmath53 , @xmath61 is the emitting path - length through the filament in pc , and @xmath62 is a geometric filling factor .",
    "based on the clumpy structure in images , we adopt @xmath63 .",
    "although this assumption dominates the uncertainty , it is difficult to quantify .",
    "we adopt a @xmath64% uncertainty in the value of @xmath62 , which translates to a @xmath65% uncertainty in the resulting value of @xmath66 . in our f656n image",
    "( note that the f656n filter on wfc3 includes only h@xmath1 , and not [ n  ii ] @xmath676583 ) , we measure an intensity of @xmath68ergs@xmath13cm@xmath53arcsec@xmath53 , which translates to @xmath69ergs@xmath13cm@xmath53arcsec@xmath53 after correcting for @xmath17mag ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) . with these values , we find @xmath70@xmath36 . as an independent estimate , from the [ s  ii ] @xmath716717 , 6731 flux ratio measured in ground - based spectra we found @xmath72@xmath36 ( smith et al .  2007 ) , with a likely uncertainty of @xmath73% .",
    "these two estimates are not too discrepant , given the uncertainties . by assuming that the toroidal geometry of the ring is filled with the average of these two density estimates , we would derive a likely mass of emitting ionised gas of 0.012m@xmath5 ( see smith et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "this estimate of the mass of ionised gas is much less than the expected total mass of h gas .",
    "the ring s dust mass of @xmath7m@xmath5 measured from the luminosity of @xmath6k dust in the sed ( see  2.5 ; figure  [ fig : sed ] ) would imply a total gas mass of roughly 0.5m@xmath5 if the equatorial ring has a normal gas : dust mass ratio of 100:1 .",
    "this implies that the ionisation fraction of the ring is only a few per cent .",
    "the equatorial ring is therefore ionisation bounded , with the location of the ionisation front determined by the flux of ionising photons from the central star as well as the initial density structure of the ring .",
    "the incomplete ionisation of the ring has a strong impact on the shape of the rest of the nebula around sbw1 , and we return to the issue in  4.1 and  4.2 .    a strong increase in the ionising flux would be expected to ionise a larger fraction of the total mass in the ring , and would affect the apparent - brightness structure of the ring .",
    "this may account for some of the observed morphological differences between sbw1 and the ring of sn  1987a , because the ring around sn  1987a is viewed after a huge burst of ionising radiation from the uv flash of the sn .",
    "for example , currently the diffuse gas that fills the interior of the sbw1 ring is bright compared to the thin ring itself , making sbw1 appear more filled - in than sn  1987a ( see figure  [ fig : deproject ] ) . if the ionising flux of sbw1 were to increase suddenly , we would expect the thin equatorial ring to get much brighter , because more of the high - density neutral gas in the ring would be ionised and the emission measure ( proportional to @xmath74 ) would rise , whereas the interior of the ring would not brighten because it is already fully ionised .",
    "given the difference in ionising flux , however , the morphologies of the two rings are already strikingly similar .",
    "figure  [ fig : deproject ] shows h@xmath1 images of the equatorial rings around both sbw1 and sn  1987a , as well as plots of the deprojected intensity around the equatorial ring for each source .",
    "these were produced by first fitting an ellipse to the _ hst _ image of each ring , and then `` deprojecting '' the appearance of the source by stretching the image by the appropriate factor along the minor axis , in order to make that ellipse into a circle .",
    "the deprojected intensity plots in figure  [ fig : deproject ] are then a radial tracing of the intensity at all position angles around the ring . for sn  1987a",
    ", this is meant to duplicate the analysis by sugerman et al.(2002 ) , which provides a basis for comparison .",
    "we then performed the same analysis for sbw1 . for sn",
    "1987a we adopted a ring inclination of @xmath758 ( sugerman et al .",
    "2002 ) , and for sbw1 we measured @xmath766 @xmath776 , in agreement with an earlier estimate of @xmath762 @xmath78 from a ground - based image ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : deproject]c and [ fig : deproject]d are surprisingly similar .",
    "if we characterise the ring structure as dominated by a number of beads along a string , we see that both the wiggles in the string ( @xmath79 ) and rough angular scale ( @xmath80 ) of the beads are similar in the two objects , where @xmath14 is the average ring radius ( 0.21pc for sn  1987a and 0.19pc for sbw1 ; see smith et al.2007 ) .",
    "the small variations in @xmath81 are typically about @xmath82% of @xmath14 for sbw1 and @xmath83% of @xmath14 for sn  1987a , with a few features reaching inward to 85% of @xmath14 for both objects .",
    "the angular scale of clumps appears somewhat larger for sn  1987a in these figures , but this depends on the effective spatial resolution , which is slightly higher for sbw1 because it is closer ( we have smoothed the sbw1 image by about a factor of 3 , but it is a factor of 7 closer ) .",
    "a typical separation between major clumps in the ring is 8 to 15 for both , with roughly 22 to 25 major clumps around each ring .",
    "note that these figures are intended to exaggerate the differences in structure between the two rings , with only a portion of @xmath14 being plotted .",
    "the main interesting result of this analysis is that if we allow for some small differences in spatial resolution and the precise arrangement of blobs , the equatorial ring around sbw1 is for all practical purposes indistinguishable from that around sn  1987a , in terms of its basic physical attributes .",
    "yet , sbw1 is a factor of 7 closer to us , and so in the original _ hst _ image we have 7 times better effective spatial resolution and can see more details of the structure than for sn  1987a .",
    "the chief reason this is interesting is that sbw1 _ does not exhibit the long r - t fingers _ envisioned for sn  1987a in order to explain the occurrence of hotspots when the tips of the r - t fingers were hit by the blast wave .",
    "instead , sbw1 appears to be a fragmented , clumpy ring with a small radial extent .",
    "since r - t fingers are expected to mark the contact discontinuity between the faster bsg wind and the slower and flattened rsg disk wind , the lack of such features carries implications for the formation mechanism of the ring : the ring is probably not formed by a fast bsg wind sweeping into an extended disk . indeed , after analysing the structures interior to the ring in the next section",
    ", we conclude that the expanding bsg wind is not directly interacting with the dense equatorial ring , due to the increased pressure resulting from photoionisation of the ring .",
    "the clumpy dense ring must therefore have had a different origin , as we discuss later .",
    "lastly , we note a possibly interesting feature of the ring morphology . the brightest part of the ring on the north - west edge , at position angle p.a .",
    "@xmath84 , coincides with a pronounced kink in the ring , exhibiting the largest jump in deviations from the average ring radius ( see figure  [ fig : deproject]c ) .",
    "the significance or cause of this structure is not obvious .",
    "however , a similar kink is seen to be associated with the brightest portions of the ring around sn  1987a as well , coincidentally also located at p.a .",
    "one can readily imagine how a single large departure from azimuthal symmetry could arise in a sudden ejection in a binary system , but this is harder to explain when the structure of the ring arises from colliding winds alone ( this is discussed in more detail below ) .",
    "the most unexpected result of this study of sbw1 concerns the diffuse emission from structures in the interior of the equatorial ring . while ground - based h@xmath1 images revealed some diffuse emission apparently filling the ring interior ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , it was difficult to reliably separate contributions from the ring and the stellar psf .",
    "f656n image shows that the distribution is not uniform across the ring ; there are two regions of enhanced h@xmath1 emission located about 1@xmath85 to 3@xmath85 on either side of the central star , and there is a marked deficit of h@xmath1 emission within 1@xmath85 to 2@xmath85 of the star ( see figures  [ fig : hst ] and [ fig : trecs ] ) .",
    "more striking , however , are the high - resolution mid - ir images obtained with t - recs on gemini south . in the mid - ir ,",
    "we see two distinct peaks of warm - dust emission located 1@xmath85 to 3@xmath85 on either side of the central star , oriented along the minor axis of the ring ( see figures  [ fig : trecs ] and [ fig : color ] ) .",
    "these dust - emission peaks appear to be spatially coincident with the enhancements of h@xmath1 mentioned above , but have a much stronger contrast in the mid - ir .",
    "the two peaks are probably caused by limb brightening of a toroidal structure with a projected radius of @xmath86 , and if they are located in the equatorial plane , these inner dust peaks occur at about 1/3 of the radius of the dense equatorial ring ( which is @xmath87pc ; smith et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the ir emission also shows a clear deficit within a few arcseconds of the star , indicating an inner region that is relatively devoid of hot dust .",
    "the double - peaked mid - ir emission has the strongest contrast at the shorter mid - ir wavelengths ( 8.8 and 11.3@xmath3 m ) , whereas the emission structure appears more uniform at the longest thermal - ir wavelength ( 18@xmath3 m ) due to a rising contribution from the outer equatorial ring .",
    "this suggests that the double - peaked features have the hottest dust , consistent with their location closer to the star than the other structures .",
    "analysis of the optical / ir sed of sbw1 ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ;  2.5 ) suggests the presence of two dust components emitting at @xmath2k and 85k .",
    "the mid - ir images therefore indicate that the warmer 190k component must be associated with the inner double - peaked emission , and that the cooler 85k component is associated with cooler dust located in the dense equatorial ring .    that the double - peaked emission inside the ring is seen in both h@xmath1 and in mid - ir continuum emission",
    "suggests that the hot dust is intermixed with ionised gas . in that case",
    ", the heating of the dust could be collisions with dust , trapped ly@xmath1 radiation , or direct heating by stellar radiation .",
    "the equilibrium grain temperature due only to stellar radiation is given by    @xmath88}^{1/4}\\,{\\rm k},\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 is the ratio of absorption to emission efficiency for the grains .",
    "for blackbodies ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) we would expect a dust temperature around 40k , adopting a stellar luminosity of @xmath91l@xmath5 and separation from the star of 1@xmath555 or 10,500au ( assuming a distance of 7kpc ) .",
    "instead , the sed indicates relatively hot dust at a temperature of @xmath2k ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) , which would require @xmath89 to be very large , around 500 .",
    "this efficiency could indicate very small grains with radii @xmath92@xmath3 m , which have very low heat capacity and can be superheated by uv radiation or trapped ly@xmath1 .",
    "significant additional heating might also occur from collisions with the ionised gas , because grains that are charged due to the photoelectric effect can have a much larger cross section for collisions with charged particles in ionized gas .",
    "a similar temperature difference occurs in the main equatorial ring , where the observed dust temperature of 85k is much larger than the expected equilibrium blackbody temperature of @xmath93k .",
    "if additional heating from trapped ly@xmath1 or collisions with ionised gas are present , this is important to consider when conducting simple radiative - transfer models of the circumstellar dust emission around luminous stars , and adds a note of caution for dust properties inferred from those models .    in any case , the exact heating mechanism of the dust interior to the ring is less critical than the fact that it resides there .",
    "the existence of dust at this location is problematic for conventional interacting - wind models for the formation of a ring nebula like the one around sn  1987a ( blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ; collins et al .",
    "1999 ; morris & podsiadlowski 2009 ) .",
    "these models predict that the r - t instabilities in the ring itself mark the contact discontinuity between the bsg wind and a pre - existing disk wind .",
    "if so , then the volume interior to the ring should be filled with mass from the bsg wind .",
    "there will be a reverse shock somewhere between the star and the ring , but this is not expected to form dust .",
    "steady bsg winds do not form dust on their own , and the sed and spectrum of the central source in sbw1 reveal no evidence for a dusty red giant star in a binary system . thus",
    ", the dust in the interior of the ring around sbw1 must have some other origin , and suggests that a simple interacting - winds model incorporating only hydrodynamic effects must be rejected .",
    "implications for a possible origin of this structure are discussed in the next section , related to the proposed existence of an ionised portion of a progenitor rsg wind around sn  1987a ( chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) .",
    "in short , we propose that the dusty region interior to the sbw1 ring originates from photoionisation and photoevaporation of neutral dusty gas in the dense equatorial ring , which then expands to partially fill the interior region of the ring .",
    "this dusty photoevaporative flow meets the expanding bsg wind at a shock interface with a toroidal geometry inside the ring .",
    "a sketch of the proposed geometry for sbw1 is given in figure  [ fig : sketch ] , and is discussed in more detail below .",
    "in the previous sections , we have described how observed structural properties of the sbw1 ring seem to be in conflict with some aspects of hydrodynamical models for the formation of sn  1987a s nebula .",
    "specifically , we highlighted the lack of long r - t fingers and the existence of dust interior to the ring .",
    "both challenge the standard interacting - winds picture where r - t fingers form as a result of instabilities in the contact discontinuity between a fast bsg wind and a flattened disk - like rsg wind .",
    "the presence of dust far interior to the ring is extremely important , because it means that the bsg wind ( presumably devoid of dust ) has not yet reached the ring , and in fact has not even penetrated past about 1/3 the radius of the ring in the equatorial plane .    in this section",
    "we suggest a modification to this scenario , wherein ionisation and evaporation of a dense neutral ring produces a photoevaporative flow which , in turn , profoundly influences the overall hydrodynamics and shaping of the nebula .",
    "these ionisation effects have so far been neglected in numerical simulations , but we argue that they are essential , and our intention is that our discussion of the observations will inspire such a numerical study .",
    "our proposed scenario follows the suggestion by chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) , who invoked a dense h  ii region arising from photoionised portions of a previous rsg wind in order to account for some aspects of the advancing blast wave of sn  1987a .",
    "the additions and modifications that we make to this scenario concern the dynamical influence of the ionised photoevaporative flow off the ring , the nature of the interaction between this flow and the bsg wind , and the origin of dust in the system ( not necessarily from a rsg wind ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sketch ] we show a sketch of the proposed geometry for the sbw1 ring and material inside it ( this is a side view in the equatorial plane ) . in brief , the picture we propose is that the warm dust seen in gemini south / t - recs images resides at or near the location of a shock front at the interface where the outflowing bsg wind meets the inward flow of dusty ionised gas that has been photoevaporated from the dense equatorial ring / torus . in a two - dimensional cross section , this structure has a parabolic shape due to the divergent flow from the ring .",
    "this is analogous to the opening angle of two colliding winds in a binary system , except here the structure is toroidal rather than a cone , because the source of the flow is a dense ring rather than a companion star . in effect , this ionised photoevaporative flow off the dense equatorial ring is able to keep the bsg wind at bay in the equatorial plane , preventing it from reaching the equatorial ring so that no direct hydrodynamical interaction between the ring and the bsg wind is able to occur . instead , ionising photons that travel ahead of the shock have the most important dynamical effect because of the increase in pressure when the gas is ionised",
    ". the geometry sketched in figure  [ fig : sketch ] could arise from a sequence of events such as that described in the following section .      in this section",
    ", we outline a possible sequence of events that may have led to the formation of the ring nebula around sbw1 .",
    "we also discuss the most relevant physical mechanisms for each component of the nebula .",
    "the key difference between this and previously suggested scenarios is the hydrodynamic role of an ionised photoevaporative flow off the ring .",
    "a key point is that the ionised gas pressure is allowed to have a major impact on the hydrodynamics because of the slow ( 1020kms@xmath13 ) initial expansion speed of the dense ring .      several previous studies that sought to explain the unusual structure of the nebula around sn  1987a assumed some form of a fast bsg wind ( 300400kms@xmath13 ) blowing into a slower rsg wind ( 510kms@xmath13 ) .",
    "different versions of this are seen in the more standard `` hydrodynamics - only '' interacting - winds model ( luo & mccray 1991 ; blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ) , as well as in the h  ii region model of chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) . in the sections to follow ,",
    "we argue that the structures observed around sbw1 seem to clearly support the model of chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) , wherein the effects of photoionisation are critical in producing a dense h  ii region at low latitudes , but allowing the bsg wind to expand freely out the poles . however , one aspect in which our suggested scenario differs from that of chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) is in the assumption of a previous rsg wind , as discussed in this section .",
    "the assumption of a previous rsg wind is motivated by the slow ( @xmath94kms@xmath13 ) expansion speed in the equatorial ring of sn  1987a .",
    "however , this assumption also introduces significant difficulties , as the rsg wind must be concentrated in a thin disk with a very high equator - to - pole density contrast ( luo & mccray 1991 ; blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , these hydrodynamic simulations predict an hourglass structure with complete polar caps , rather than empty polar rings . since the extended envelope of any single rsg star will have a very low angular velocity",
    ", one must invoke some interaction with a companion star in a binary system ( possibly even a merger ) in any scenario involving a rsg ( collins et al .",
    "1999 ; morris & podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "yet , if one must invoke a binary system , then a previous rsg phase is not really needed , because a rsg wind is not the only way to form a slowly expanding dusty equatorial ring , and moreover , such a flattened disk - like outflow has never been observed around a rsg ( binary or single ) . a different case that has well - established observational and theoretical precedent is the episodic ejection of a ring by a bsg .",
    "this could have been the result of a binary merger event ( morris & podsiadlowski 2009 ) , an episodic ejection event occurring during roche - lobe overflow ( rlof ) as seen in the eclipsing binary ry  scuti ( smith et al .",
    "2011 ) , or an eruptive ejection from a rotating star ( smith & townsend 2007 ; shacham & shaviv 2012 ) . in either a binary merger event or accretion from a companion in rlof ,",
    "a large amount of angular momentum must be shed in order for material to be accreted onto the merger product or the mass - gaining star , respectively , and one thus expects the mechanical mass shedding to occur in the equator .",
    "if the mass loss is episodic , this brief equatorial ejection will form a ring rather than an extended disk because of the brief nature of the mass ejection .",
    "shedding of mass at the equator in this way forms a nearly keplerian ring with a relatively slow radial expansion speed , which can be much less than the escape speed from the surface of a bsg star .",
    "a prime example of the scenario we suggest is seen in the galactic eclipsing binary system ry  scuti , in which an ob supergiant binary system undergoing rlof has recently ejected a ring / torus that is spatially resolved in _ hst",
    "_ images ( smith et al .  1999 , 2002 , 2011 ) .",
    "the radial expansion speed of the equatorial ring / torus in ry  scuti is only 3040kms@xmath13 ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) , much less than the several hundred kms@xmath13 escape velocity or wind speed from the o9/b0 supergiant stars .",
    "moreover , this has occurred without a rsg phase , because the stars are too close together with an orbital period of only @xmath95 days ( grundstrom et al .",
    "2007 ; smith et al.2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "ry  scuti is an important example , because measured proper motions of the very young ( 120yr old ) nebula show that the equatorial mass loss was the result of a pair of _ brief episodic ejections _ rather than a steady flow of mass from the equator ( smith et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "moreover , the nebula around ry  scuti reveals that the slow equatorial outflow led to the formation of significant amounts of dust ( gehrz et al .",
    "2001 ) , even though it is a binary composed of two hot ob supergiants .",
    "in fact , episodic or eruptive mass loss like that seen in luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) may be an essential ingredient for the formation of dust around bsg stars , as discussed in detail recently by kochanek ( 2011 ) .",
    "the class of b[e ] supergiant stars provides many additional examples of bsg stars that have formed significant quantities of dust in a slowly expanding equatorial ring or torus ( e.g. , zickgraf et al .",
    "_ thus , the formation of a slow and dusty equatorial ring does not require a previous rsg phase .",
    "_ in fact , of the three known galactic analogues of the nebula around sn  1987a ( these are hd  168625 , sher  25 , and sbw1 ) , two ( sher  25 and sbw1 ) have chemical abundances that are inconsistent with a previous rsg phase ( smartt et al .  2002 ; smith et al .",
    "the third analog , hd  168526 , is an lbv that has quite likely suffered previous eruptive mass loss ( smith 2007 ) .",
    "what about the observed clumpy structure of the sbw1 ring ?",
    "as noted above , the dust residing far interior to the ring suggests that the bsg wind has not yet reached the radius of the dense equatorial ring , and as such , the clumps observed in the equatorial ring can not be the result of r - t instabilities at the contact discontinuity as required in interacting - winds models .",
    "we suggest instead that this regular clumpy structure may occur naturally due to thermal instability and fragmentation of an ejected ring , rather than from r - t instabilities . in both sbw1 and sn  1987a ,",
    "the measured ring expansion speed is 1020kms@xmath13 , so the initially ionised ring would be expected to fragment as it cools and recombines ( and its sound speed drops well below 10kms@xmath13 ) . perhaps this fragmentation could lead to the fairly regular series of clumps around the ring in both objects ( figure  [ fig : deproject ] ) .",
    "this is , however , a minor point .",
    "subsequently , as the bsg star now seen at the centre of sbw1 recovers from the mass - loss event and presumably contracts to become a hotter bsg , its wind speed ( escape speed ) and its ionising flux could both increase , and their ratio has an important influence on the resulting structure .",
    "the influence of photoionisation of the ring ejecta is discussed next .      after ejecting a thin equatorial ring ,",
    "the inner edge of the ring will be exposed to ionising photons from the central bsg star .",
    "chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) predicted that photoionisation had a strong impact on the structure interior to the sn  1987a ring , and we suggest a similar process in the case of the observed structure around sbw1 .",
    "the central star of sbw1 is a b1.5  iab supergiant , which should produce an ionising photon flux of roughly @xmath96s@xmath13 ( see martins et al .",
    "this radiation flux ionises the inward - facing surface of the ring at a radius @xmath97pc from the star . in ",
    "3.1 , we found that the total mass of ionised gas emitting h@xmath1 was too low , inconsistent with the larger mass we would expect to be associated with the cool 85k dust in the ring .",
    "we therefore conclude that most of the mass in the ring is neutral h residing in high - density clumps in the ring , which must be self - shielded from the bsg star s ionising radiation .",
    "the minimum density @xmath98 required to keep the clumps neutral can be estimated from simple ionisation balance :    @xmath99    where @xmath100@xmath101s@xmath13 is the case b hydrogen recombination coefficient and @xmath102pc is the same observed depth of the emitting layer of the ring as before .",
    "we find an expected density in the ring of @xmath103@xmath36 .",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude higher than the electron densities derived from the [ s  ii ] line - intensity ratio and from the observed emission measure of h@xmath1 ( both are discussed above in  3.1 ) , thus confirming that h@xmath1 and [ s   ii ] emission trace only a fraction of the total mass , associated with a thin ionised skin and ionised photoevaporative flow coming off the ring ( the rest of the mass remains neutral ) .    when the neutral gas in the clumps gets ionised , its temperature increases to @xmath104k and the overpressure causes the gas to expand away from the dense clump ( e.g. , oort & spitzer 1955 ) .",
    "the expansion speed should be of the same order as the sound speed in ionised gas , @xmath105kms@xmath13 .",
    "this is also comparable to the expansion speed of the ring itself .",
    "the photoablation mass - loss rate is roughly    @xmath106    which is roughly equal to 8@xmath10710@xmath108 @xmath109 yr@xmath13 for the parameters given above .",
    "this , in turn , suggests a lifetime for the neutral ring of 6@xmath10710@xmath110 yr , longer than the @xmath810@xmath110 yr dynamical age of the ring ( smith et al .",
    "the resulting ionised photoevaporative flow is closely analogous to the ionised photoevaporative flows from neutral clouds at the edges of h  ii regions , as discussed in detail by bertoldi ( 1989 ) and bertoldi & mckee ( 1990 ) .",
    "a similar role of photoevaporation is at work in the proplyds in the orion nebula , as discussed more below .",
    "the originally neutral gas in the dense equatorial ring is mixed with dust .",
    "this cool dust resides outside the ionisation front in the ring , and is observed as the @xmath6k component in the ir sed of sbw1 ( figure  [ fig : sed ] ) , which is spatially resolved to be coincident with the thin ring in our 18@xmath3 m gemini / t - recs image ( figure  [ fig : trecs ] ) . after being struck by ionising photons , the ionised photoevaporated material from the ring will likely entrain the dust with it as it expands into the interior of the ring .",
    "thus , we refer to the resulting expansion as a dusty photoevaporative flow ( dpf ) in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "this dust in the dpf moves inward and eventually piles up at the shock front ( discussed in the following section ) , giving rise to hot ( @xmath2k ) dust emission peaks inside the ring that are spatially resolved in gemini images ( figures  [ fig : trecs ] and [ fig : color ] ) .",
    "this hypothesis seems far more likely than any alternative explanation for the origin of dust seen interior to the ring in mid - ir images .",
    "such alternatives would require that dust forms quickly in the fast bsg wind and survives passage through the strong ( several @xmath111kms@xmath13 ) reverse shock .",
    "this physical situation we propose for sbw1 has an interesting analog in the evaporating protoplanetary disks ( the so - called `` proplyds '' ) seen in _",
    "images of the orion nebula ( see bally et al .  1998 ; johnstone et al .",
    "1998 ) . in these objects ,",
    "uv radiation from the nearby o6  v star @xmath112c  ori causes a photoevaporative flow off the dense and dusty protoplanetary disk envelopes that are seen in silhouette . after passing through an ionisation front , the ionised photoevaporative flow continues to expand in a divergent flow until it collides directly with the fast stellar wind of @xmath112c  ori .",
    "the proplyds located in the trapezium very close to @xmath112c  ori show bright arcs of h@xmath1 emission marking the shock between the ionised photoevaporative flow and the stellar wind ( bally et al.1998 ) .",
    "interestingly , these same h@xmath1 arcs are also very bright in the thermal - ir continuum in high - resolution 11.7@xmath3 m images ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ) , indicating the presence of hot dust .",
    "since the wind of @xmath112c  ori is too fast , rarefied , and hot to form dust on its own , the dust in these shocks must have been entrained in the ionised photoevaporative flow from the proplyds .",
    "this is akin to the situation we propose for sbw1 , except that instead of an externally ionised disk envelope in the orion proplyds , we have a thin ring illuminated from the inside .",
    "because of the thin - ring geometry of the neutral gas reservoir , the dpf will expand into the interior of the ring toward the star , but the pressure of the ionised gas will also cause it to expand over a range of latitudes above and below the equator .",
    "this will form a thicker torus - like geometry stretching from the equatorial plane to mid latitudes , as depicted by the dpf in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the dpf will expand away from the dense equatorial ring , primarily into its interior , until it collides with the outflow from the stellar wind of the central bsg .",
    "this collision between the bsg wind and the dpf will have three boundaries : the reverse shock that decelerates the bsg wind , the forward shock driven into the dpf , and the contact discontinuity between them .",
    "these are labeled in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the zone between the forward shock and contact discontinuity is drawn as a thin region , due to the high - density gas and slow velocity of the forward shock .",
    "the region between the contact discontinuity and reverse shock is thicker , due to the higher speed and lower density of the bsg wind .    consider the balance between the gas pressure of the ionised photoevaporative flow ( h  ii region ) and the ram pressure of the bsg wind in the equatorial plane :    @xmath113    where @xmath66 and @xmath114 are the ionised gas density and temperature in the h  ii region , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the mass - loss rate and wind speed of the bsg wind , respectively .",
    "while the pressure in the h  ii region is roughly constant with radius , the ram pressure of the wind drops with radius from the star if we assume a steady bsg wind ( @xmath117 density profile ) .",
    "then @xmath14 is the radius where the two balance , given by    @xmath118    where we have assumed @xmath119k in the h  ii region , @xmath120 is the bsg wind mass - loss rate in units of @xmath121m@xmath5yr@xmath13 , and @xmath122 is the wind speed in units of 300kms@xmath13 .",
    "we derived a density of about 500@xmath36 for the ionised gas in the interior of the ring (  3.1 ) , so this is used as a reference value .",
    "we derived an _ upper limit _ to the bsg mass - loss rate of @xmath123m@xmath5yr@xmath13 from the ir flux of the central star (  2.5 ) , so @xmath121m@xmath5yr@xmath13 is used as a fiducial value .",
    "we assumed a value for @xmath116 of 300kms@xmath13 , as above .",
    "these are similar to the values adopted for the progenitor of sn  1987a by chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) as well . with these values ,",
    "the stand - off shock will be at @xmath124pc from the bsg .",
    "this is about 25% of the radius of the ring , which roughly matches the location of the hot dust and enhanced h@xmath1 emission in images , and which we associate with the shock front .",
    "the agreement indicates that this interpretation is plausible .",
    "an approved program in _ hst _ cycle 20 will use the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) to obtain a uv spectrum of the central star in sbw1 , allowing direct estimates of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    since the h  ii region is toroidal and caused by evaporation of a thin equatorial ring , we expect the density to drop at latitudes above and below the equator because the ionised photoevaporative flow diverges .",
    "if so , this would cause the location of the shock front to curve outward to larger radii , as depicted in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the variation with latitude is discussed further below .    in the sketch of the geometry shown in figure  [ fig : sketch ] , mass in the outflowing bsg wind and gas from the ionised photoevaporative flow will both pile up at the shock front . after colliding ,",
    "the post - shock gas should then flow away from the star , in a nonradial trajectory that follows the geometry of the shock interface ( small black arrows in figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to flow down the shock cone in a colliding - wind binary , but here the geometry is toroidal rather than a cone .",
    "the material in this post - shock flow is denser than gas in the h  ii region or the bsg wind .",
    "it is this higher - density zone of ionised gas that probably dominates h@xmath1 emission because of the @xmath74 dependence of recombination emission .",
    "in fact , it seems likely that the dense gas in this post - shock flow has already been observed directly .",
    "there is evidence for the resulting nonradial flow in high - resolution , long - slit echelle spectra of h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] emission in sbw1 that we presented in a previous study ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , obtained with the emmi spectrograph on the ntt . in that paper , we were perplexed by the unusual position / velocity structures , but it now makes sense in the context of the geometry proposed above . in figure  [ fig : emmi ]",
    "we show the position - velocity diagram of the earlier emmi echelle spectra of [ n  ii ] @xmath676583 , presented originally by smith et al.(2007 ) , as well as a sketch for how these velocity structures may arise from the nonradial flow at the shock interface .",
    "while a quantitative test of this idea will require numerical simulations of the hydrodynamics , the cartoon of the nonradial flow trajectories in figure  [ fig : emmi]c provides a reasonable explanation for the observed position - velocity structure in figure  [ fig : emmi]b .      in both sbw1 and around sn  1987a , _ hst _ images do not reveal dense nebular material in the polar directions",
    ". rather , the polar rings of sn  1987a are true hollow rings residing at mid latitudes ( burrows et al .",
    "1995 ; plait et al .  1995 ) .",
    "the same appears to be true based on our _ hst _ images of sbw1 .",
    "the lack of any dense polar structures in sbw1 or in sn  1987a argues against a shaping mechanism like the one discussed by morris & podsiadlowski ( 2009 ) , because that formation model predicts dense polar caps in the nebula .",
    "the same is true for most of the colliding - wind models that predict complete hourglass shapes ( see above ) , not empty rings at mid latitudes .",
    "if such polar caps existed , they would be impacted by the fast polar wind of the bsg , and would likely be swept into a thin dense shell , and this interface would therefore be easy to detect in deep images .    instead",
    ", the empty polar regions favour a different scenario like that suggested by chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) , which is similar to the picture we advocate here . rather than a pre - existing disk wind",
    ", we have proposed that the central bsg star episodically ejects a dense ring , which is then photoionised as it expands . the ionised gas expands to form a thick torus around the ring , which provides a barrier for the bsg wind .",
    "the collision between the wind and the ionised torus ( h   ii region ) creates a curved shock front . in this picture ,",
    "all of the slow and dense material is confined to low latitudes , so that the bsg wind is able to expand with no obstruction out the poles .",
    "_ is the bsg wind spherical ?",
    "_ ejection of an equatorial ring requires a system with excess angular momentum , suggesting either a rapidly rotating star or a close binary system . even in a binary system with rlof ,",
    "the mass - gainer star accretes both mass and angular momentum , and would be expected to be in very rapid rotation .",
    "the geometry of the stellar wind from a rapidly rotating hot star is complicated , because hot stars have line - driven winds .",
    "rapidly rotating stars suffer gravity darkening ( von zeipel 1924 ) , producing cooler equatorial zones and hotter poles .",
    "such stars also have higher escape speeds out the poles than at the equator , so the polar winds are faster . the oblate structure of the star produces a larger cross - section in the polar directions , and also the hotter poles produce much more radiative flux ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is critical for a radiation - driven wind .",
    "this stronger radiative flux at the poles , combined with velocity - dependent forces , means that rapidly rotating stars have higher mass flux and higher wind speed out the poles ( see owocki et al .",

    "this is for radiatively driven mass loss  different from the more intuitive case of mechanical mass loss from a spinning object , which should produce an equatorial flow ( appropriate for rlof ) .    including a stronger polar wind for",
    "the present state of the central bsg would not change the qualitative picture in figure  [ fig : sketch ] , because a stronger wind out the poles would still escape unobstructed .",
    "it may , however , make it easier to produce this shape and to reconcile the required values of @xmath115 with those of normal bsg stars .",
    "note that for a b1.5  iab star , the expected value of @xmath115 is @xmath126m@xmath5yr@xmath13 , or perhaps a small factor less if we allow for clumping .",
    "this would be in rough agreement with our upper limit for sbw1 derived from ir observations , @xmath127m@xmath5yr@xmath13 .",
    "however , for both sbw1 and sn  1987a , densities at the equator would seem to suggest a slightly lower value of @xmath115 , closer to @xmath121m@xmath5yr@xmath13 . moreover , our assumed wind speed of 300kms@xmath13 ( the same value assumed by chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) is somewhat lower than the speeds we expect for a b1.5 supergiant , closer to 500600kms@xmath13 . perhaps the factor of 23 discrepancy in @xmath115 and @xmath128 is not too concerning , but allowing the central bsg to have a bipolar wind  with higher @xmath115 and @xmath128 out the poles , and lower @xmath115 and @xmath128 at low latitudes near the equator  would make the agreement better .    a bipolar wind from the bsg might also help explain another observed peculiarity of sn  1987a .",
    "studies of the evolution of light echoes from sn  1987a have revealed a large bipolar shell , much larger than the triple - ring system seen in _",
    "images ( sugerman et al.2005 ; crotts et al .  1995",
    "; wampler et al .",
    "1990 ) . in the geometry advocated here ,",
    "there are no polar caps in the inner nebula , so the strong bsg wind is free to escape out the poles to much larger radii .",
    "doing so , a bipolar wind could sweep into the surrounding interstellar medium and create a much larger bipolar shell .",
    "we have noted multiple times that while interacting - winds models can reproduce structures resembling the equatorial rings around sn  1987a and sbw1 by forming an hourglass shape ( blondin & lundqvist 1993 ; martin & arnett 1995 ; collins et al .",
    "1999 ) , the polar rings of sn  1987a have actually been an enduring problem with no satisfactory explanation .",
    "the nebula around sbw1 does not exhibit polar rings that are as prominent as those around sn  1987a , but the detailed geometry we see in sbw1 may provide some intriguing clues about how the polar rings might have been formed .    the key difference between previously published interacting - winds models and the model advocated here is the existence of a dense dpf off the compact and dense equatorial ring ( figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "we have argued that its existence in sbw1 is supported by the presence of dust interior to the thin h@xmath1 ring ( figure  [ fig : color ] ) , as well as the unusual kinematic structure of the emission lines in long - slit echelle spectra ( figure  [ fig : emmi ] ) .",
    "chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) argued for the existence of a similar structure around sn  1987a based on the properties of the advancing blast wave .",
    "this dpf creates a stand - off shock front ( reverse shock ) in the equator at @xmath129pc , but at latitudes above and below the equator the interface will take a parabolic shape in cross section ( figure  [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "how does the existence of this dpf and reverse shock modify the situation ? in this scenario , one would still expect the formation of a thin hourglass - shaped nebula as the h  ii region tries to expand into any neutral gas outside it ( see chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ) .",
    "the fast bsg wind will escape in the polar direction and will sweep away any of this outer nebulosity , _ but it will be prevented from doing so at low latitudes . _ in effect , the dpf and reverse shock keep the bsg stellar wind at bay , and thereby shield the nebula at low latitudes .",
    "therefore , we expect that the thin outer hourglass structure will remain at mid and low latitudes , as depicted in figure  [ fig : sketch ]",
    ".    now , recall that the collision between the dpf and the bsg stellar wind leads to a nonradial flow of dense gas down the shock front ( figure  [ fig : emmi ] ) .",
    "an interesting consequence of the proposed flow down the shock interface is that the densest gas will flow outward at a narrow range of latitudes above and below the equator .",
    "this flow may eventually intersect the hourglass structure , which in this picture is the outer boundary of the photoionised cavity  labeled as the ionisation shock front in figure  [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "interestingly , the geometrical intersection of these two curved surfaces in three dimensions is a pair of plane - parallel rings above and below the equator .",
    "( this would still be true if the outer ionisation shock front were an hourglass , a sphere , or a cylinder . )",
    "if there is a density enhancement associated with this intersection , it may help explain the origin of the polar rings around sn  1987a and hd  168625 .",
    "alternatively , a similar idea was suggested by chi et al.(2008 ) based on their hydrodynamic simulations of a bipolar bsg wind interacting with a thin spherical shell formed by the terminal shock of the previous rsg phase .",
    "they assumed that as the star evolves in a blue loop after the rsg phase , the star must spin up , and that the wind from the bsg will have a bipolar shape for the reasons noted in  4.2.4 .",
    "these authors showed that the collision of a bipolar wind with a thin shell could lead to a pair of polar rings . in this scenario ,",
    "the existence of the reverse shock could help to stabilise the latitude range where the bipolar bsg wind and thin shell intersect , so that the rings would not be as transient as in those simulations .",
    "we hope that the observations and discussion presented here will motivate new simulations that include the effects of a dpf .",
    "this basic picture also allows for some differences among objects , which may help explain some of the diversity in the structures seen around sn  1987a , sbw1 , sher  25 , and hd  168625 . for sbw1 and sn  1987a",
    ", we expect that the initial structures of the two nebulae were very similar , but that in sn  1987a , the structure has been modified : the dense ring has become more fully ionised and the interior dust was probably vaporised by a uv flash from sn shock breakout . even ignoring the supernova uv flash ,",
    "however , certain aspects of the structure can be adjusted .",
    "for example , other central stars may have different values of @xmath130 or @xmath115 , either of which may change the relative location of the shock between the bsg and the photoevaporative flow , and may affect the opening angle .",
    "this could have important implications for understanding when the sn  1987a blast wave encountered the h  ii region ( see chevalier & dwarkadas 1995 ; gaensler et al .",
    "the stellar luminosity values for sbw1 and sk@xmath969@xmath10202 are very similar , so their mass - loss rates should be similar , but sbw1 is hotter ( b1.5 instead of b3 ) and has a higher value of @xmath131 .",
    "this may strengthen the relative importance of the dpf somewhat in sbw1 .",
    "nevertheless , sbw1 and sn  1987a may trace one another more closely than in other bsg ring nebulae , such as sher  25 and hd  168625 , both of which have substantially higher stellar luminosities .",
    "nevertheless , one could probably tune the basic picture presented here to be applicable to those two objects as well .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a series of multiwavelength images and spectra of the nebula around the blue supergiant sbw1 , which is seen in the carina nebula .",
    "the observations included the first images and spectra of this target obtained with _",
    "hst _ using wfc3 and stis , as well as ir images from _ spitzer _ and gemini south / t - recs .",
    "analysis of this multiwavelength dataset has led to several conclusions about sbw1 and related systems , enumerated below .",
    "\\(1 ) _ hst_/wfc3-uvis f656n and f658n images of sbw1 reveal a thin , clumpy ring , but do not show the long r - t fingers that have been invoked to explain the origin of the hot spots around sn  1987a when the tips of the r - t fingers are hit by the blast wave . instead",
    ", the structure is more akin to beads along a string with little dense matter in between . instead of arising when a wind swept into an extended thin equatorial disk , as suggested by hydrodynamical modeling of sn  1987a",
    ", the observed structure may suggest an episodic ejection of a ring that fragmented into clumps as it cooled .",
    "\\(2 ) we noted that the episodic ejection of a slow , clumpy ring could result during a brief phase of rlof , as seen in the ry  scuti eclipsing binary system . a previous rsg phase is not needed to explain the slow expansion speed of the ring .",
    "\\(3 ) the radius of the ring , size and angular scale of clumps in the ring , and deviations from the average radius ( wiggles ) seen in sbw1 are all an excellent match to the structures seen in sn  1987a s ring .",
    "\\(4 ) the radial velocity measured in our stis spectra as well as the luminosity and extinction indicated by the sed both confirm the large distance of @xmath132 kpc ( smith et al .",
    "2007 ) , meaning that sbw1 is far behind the carina nebula and seen in projection , rather than actually being inside it .",
    "\\(5 ) high - resolution images reveal complex diffuse emission filling the interior of the ring .",
    "h@xmath1 emission seen by _ hst _ uniformly fills much of the ring interior , with two enhancements in the h@xmath1 flux about 12 away from the star on both sides along the major axis .",
    "much more importantly , mid - ir images obtained with gemini south reveal strong dust continuum emission associated with these same positions .",
    "the warm dust emission residing inside the ring is critically important , because the dust can not arise from the bsg wind .",
    "\\(6 ) the ir sed reveals two distinct dust - temperature components : @xmath133k dust with a mass of only @xmath4m@xmath5 , and @xmath6k dust with a larger mass of @xmath7m@xmath5 .",
    "this implies a total gas mass for the sbw1 ring of at least 0.5m@xmath5 .",
    "high - resolution mid - ir images from gemini south confirm that the cooler 85k component arises from dust in the dense equatorial ring , whereas the warmer 190k dust comes from the double - peaked diffuse emission in the ring s interior .",
    "\\(8 ) we propose a model for the origin of the observed structures in sbw1 that departs markedly from the standard interacting - winds model for sn  1987a . instead of the equatorial ring arising as a consequence of a fast wind sweeping into a slow extended disk wind , we propose that the ring was ejected in an episodic event and then photoionised by the bsg . when the dense neutral clumps in the ring get ionised , they produce an ionised photoevaporative flow that has an important hydrodynamic effect because of the pressure of the ionised gas .",
    "the double - peaked diffuse h@xmath1 and mid - ir emission inside the ring marks the location of a shock where the bsg wind collides with the dusty photoevaporative flow ( dpf ) .",
    "this dpf structure is analogous to the `` h  ii region '' proposed by chevalier & dwarkadas ( 1995 ) to account for the expansion of the blast wave of sn  1987a .",
    "\\(10 ) when the dpf and bsg wind collide in the equator , they must flow downstream .",
    "the shock front probably takes on a curved shape , diverting the flow to a narrow range of mid - latitudes ( see figures  [ fig : sketch ] and [ fig : emmi ] ) .",
    "\\(11 ) we note some implications for the origin of structures around sn  1987a .",
    "if the bsg wind expands freely out the poles ( i.e. , there are no polar caps in the nebula ) , it may help explain the existence of a much larger bipolar shell seen with light echoes ( sugerman et al.2005 ) .",
    "moreover , the nonradial post - shock flow that is confined to a narrow range of latitudes ( point 10 above ) may help explain the existence of the polar rings around sn  1987a when this flow intersects the dense shell at the outer boundary of the h  ii region .",
    "we encourage further investigation of this idea using numerical simulations that account for the effects of a photoionised flow .",
    "as we note in the text , this photoionised flow is permitted to have an important dynamical effect because the initial expansion speed of the neutral dense ring is slow , comparable to the sound speed in the ionised gas .",
