    "high - energy @xmath0  colliders have been essential instruments to search for the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions .",
    "merged with the experimental observations at hadron accelerators , a coherent picture of the structure of matter has evolved , that is adequately described by the standard model .",
    "the matter particles , leptons and quarks , can be classified in three families with identical symmetries .",
    "the electroweak and strong forces are described by gauge field theories , based on the symmetry group @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the third component of the standard model , still hypothetical , is the higgs mechanism @xcite through which the masses of the fundamental fermions and gauge bosons are generated .",
    "the standard model has been tremendously successful in predicting the properties of new particles and the structure of the basic interactions . in many of its facets",
    "it has been tested at an accuracy significantly better than 1 percent .",
    "the higgs mechanism however has not been established experimentally so far .    despite the success in describing leptons , quarks and their interactions ,",
    "the standard model can not be considered as the _ ultima ratio _ of nature .",
    "neither the fundamental parameters , masses and couplings , nor the symmetry pattern are accounted for ; these elements are merely built into the model .",
    "moreover , gravity , with a nature quite different from the electroweak and strong forces , is not incorporated in the theory .",
    "first steps which could lead us to solutions of these problems are associated with the unification of the electroweak and strong interactions @xcite , and with a possible supersymmetric extension of the model @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry provides a bridge from the presently explored energy scales to the scale of grand unified theories , which is close to the planck scale where gravity becomes important .",
    "no such path is known , at the present time , for alternative compositeness scenarios which may include several new layers of matter between the low energy scale and the planck scale .",
    "two strategies can be followed in future experiments to explore the area beyond the standard model and to reveal the signals of new physical phenomena .",
    "first , the properties of the particles and forces in the standard model may be affected by new energy scales .",
    "precision studies of the top quark and the electroweak gauge bosons can thus reveal clues to the physics beyond the standard model .",
    "second , if the machine energies are high enough to cross the relevant thresholds , new phenomena can be searched for directly and studied thoroughly .",
    "this is of course the prime _",
    "raison d@xmath60tre _ for any new accelerator .",
    "while the presently operating collider facilities , the @xmath0  collider lep2 , the @xmath61 collider hera and the @xmath62 collider tevatron , cover the energy range up to a scale of 200 to 300 gev , the @xmath63 collider lhc and @xmath0  linear colliders will enable us to explore the energy range up to the tev scale .    on the basis of this dual approach",
    ", a variety of fundamental problems can be investigated that are so far unresolved within the standard model , and that demand experiments at energies beyond the range of the existing accelerators .",
    "@xmath64 the mass of the _ top quark _ is much larger than the masses of all the other quarks and leptons , and even of the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "understanding the r@xmath65le of this particle in nature is therefore a key element of future experiments .",
    "the experimental analysis of the @xmath66 threshold region in @xmath0  collisions will allow the measurement of the top quark mass to an accuracy less than 200 mev , improving the accuracy of about 2  gev at the lhc significantly .",
    "this is a highly desirable goal since future theories of flavor dynamics should provide relations among the lepton masses , quark masses and mixing angles in which the heavy top quark is expected to play a key role .",
    "in addition , stringent tests of the electroweak sector in the standard model can be carried out at the quantum level when the top mass is known accurately .",
    "analyses of the ( @xmath67 ) production vertices and of the @xmath68 decay vertex will determine the magnetic dipole moments of the top quark and the chirality of the decay current .",
    "bounds on the @xmath69 violating electric dipole moments of the @xmath70 quark can be set in a similar way .",
    "@xmath71 the experimental study of the dynamics of the _ electroweak gauge bosons _ is an equally important task at high energy @xmath0  colliders .",
    "the form and the strength of the triple and quartic couplings of these particles are uniquely prescribed by the non - abelian gauge symmetry of the standard model .",
    "the triple gauge boson couplings define the electroweak charges , the magnetic dipole moments and the electric quadrupole moments of the @xmath72 bosons .",
    "any small deviation from the values of these parameters predicted in the standard model , will destroy the unitarity cancellations of the gauge theories .",
    "their effect will therefore be magnified by increasing the energy , and the bounds will tighten considerably with rising energy .",
    "@xmath73 while the lhc can cover the canonical mass range , @xmath0  colliders with an energy between 300 and 500 gev are ideal instruments to search for _ higgs particles _ throughout the mass range characterized by the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the mass of the higgs particle is not determined by existing theory , but the intermediate mass range below @xmath74 gev is theoretically a most attractive region for higgs masses . in this scenario , higgs particles remain weakly interacting up to the scale of grand unification , thus providing a path for the renormalization of the electroweak mixing angle @xmath75 from the symmetry value 3/8 in grand unified theories down to @xmath76 which is close to the experimentally observed value 0.23 .",
    "once the higgs particle is found , its properties can be studied thoroughly , i.e. the external quantum numbers @xmath77 and the higgs couplings , including the self - couplings of the particle .",
    "these are fundamental tests to establish the nature of the higgs mechanism experimentally .",
    "even though many aspects of the standard model are experimentally supported to a very high accuracy , the embedding of the model into a more comprehensive theory is to be expected .",
    "the argument is based on the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if the higgs boson is light , the standard model can naturally be embedded in a grand unified theory .",
    "the large gap which exists between the low electroweak scale and the high grand unification scale in this scenario , can be stabilized by supersymmetry . if the higgs boson is very heavy , or if no fundamental higgs boson exists , new strong interactions between the massive electroweak gauge bosons are predicted by unitarity at the tev scale .",
    "thus , the next generation of accelerators which will operate in the tev energy range , can uncover the structure of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the following two disgruent theories are the opposite endpoints in the arch of possible physics scenarios .",
    "they will be considered in detail :    @xmath64 the electroweak and strong forces are traced back to a common origin in _ grand unified theories_. this idea can be realized in various scenarios some of which predict new vector bosons and a plethora of new fermions .",
    "the mass scales of these novel particles could be as low as a few hundred gev .",
    "intimately related to the grand unification of the gauge symmetries is _",
    "supersymmetry_. this symmetry unifies matter and forces by pairing the associated fermionic and bosonic particles in multiplets .",
    "several arguments strongly support the hypothesis that this symmetry is realized in nature .",
    "( a ) as argued before , supersymmetry stabilizes light masses of higgs particles in the context of high energy scales as realized in grand unified theories .",
    "( b ) the higgs mechanism itself can be generated in supersymmetric theories as a quantum effect .",
    "the breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath78 can be induced radiatively while leaving the electromagnetic gauge symmetry @xmath79 and the color gauge symmetry @xmath80 unbroken for a top quark mass between 150 and 200 gev .",
    "( c ) this symmetry concept is strongly supported by the successful prediction of the electroweak mixing angle in the minimal version of the theory .",
    "the particle spectrum in this theory drives the evolution of the electroweak mixing angle from the gut value 3/8 down to @xmath81 = 0.2336 @xmath82 0.0017 ; this prediction coincides with the experimentally measured value @xmath83 = 0.2315 @xmath82 0.0003 , within the theoretical uncertainty of less than 2 permille .",
    "a spectrum of several neutral and charged higgs bosons is predicted in supersymmetric theories . in nearly all scenarios ,",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs boson is less than @xmath84 gev while the heavy higgs particles have masses of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "many other novel particles are predicted in supersymmetric theories .",
    "the scalar partners of the leptons could have masses in the range of @xmath74 gev whereas squarks are expected to be considerably heavier .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric states are likely to be non - colored gaugino / higgsino states with masses possibly in the 100 gev range .",
    "searching for these supersymmetric particles will be one of the most important tasks at the lhc and at future @xmath0  colliders .",
    "moreover , the high accuracy which can be achieved in measurements of masses and couplings , will allow the reconstruction of the key elements of the underlying grand unified theories , which may be generated within the supersymmetric extension of gravity .",
    "@xmath71 in the alternative scenario of heavy or no fundamental higgs bosons , _ strong _ _ interactions between electroweak bosons _ would be observed in the elastic scattering of these particles at tev energies .",
    "new resonances would be formed , the properties of which would uncover the nature of the underlying microscopic interactions .    not only would the properties and interactions of the electroweak bosons be affected but also those of the fundamental fermions , leptons and quarks in such a scenario . in the most dramatic departure from the standard model , these particles would be built up by new subconstituents corresponding to a new layer in the structure of matter .",
    "this alternative scenario would manifest itself in non - zero radii of quarks and leptons and the existence of novel bound states such as leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "while new vector bosons and particles carrying color quantum numbers can be searched for very efficiently at the hadron collider lhc , @xmath0  colliders provide in many ways unique opportunities to discover and explore the non - colored particles .",
    "this is most obvious in supersymmetric theories . combining lep2 analyses with future searches at the lhc , the individual light and heavy higgs bosons can be found only in part of the supersymmetry parameter space",
    "; even if all channels are combined , the coverage of the entire parameter space is guaranteed only if non - supersymmetric decay modes of the higgs bosons prevail .",
    "squarks and gluinos can be searched for very efficiently at the lhc . yet",
    ", the detailed experimental study of their properties is very difficult at this machine .",
    "likewise , cascade decays proceeding in several steps , will allow the search for other , non - colored supersymmetric particles , yet a general model  independent analysis of gauginos / higgsinos and scalar sleptons can only be carried out at @xmath0  colliders with well - defined kinematics at the level of the individual subprocesses .",
    "they will allow to perform high - precision studies which are impossible or very difficult to carry out at hadron colliders .",
    "only the detailed knowledge of all the properties of the colored and non - colored supersymmetric states , gathered both at the lhc and @xmath0  experiments , will finally enable us to reveal the structure of the underlying theory .",
    "the physics programme of @xmath0 linear colliders , summarized briefly in table  [ t0 ] , is in many aspects complementary to the programme of the proton collider lhc .",
    "the properties of the top quark , the electroweak gauge bosons , the higgs particles , the supersymmetric or other novel particles can be explored with high accuracy in a universal way , independent of favorable circumstances .",
    "these analyses will enable us to cover the energy range above the existing machines up to the tev region in a conclusive form .",
    "this will provide essential information for elucidating the structure of matter at a much more basic level than accessible today  in particular , if grand unified theories are true , we will gain insight into the most fundamental levels of all .",
    "the energy  physics matrix   +    the discussion in this report will focus on the physics with @xmath0  colliders in the first phase , corresponding to center - of - mass energies above lep2 up to @xmath85 gev ; it will be assumed that the energy will be upgraded adiabatically up to about 800  gev . where necessary",
    ", we will refer to the second high - energy phase of the machine , anticipating an energy of about 1.6  tev . to cover some physical scenarios",
    "it is necessary to extend the energy of the two phases up to 1 and 2 tev , respectively .",
    "the integrated luminosity for energies at and below 500 gev will in general be taken as @xmath86 50 fb@xmath87 , corresponding to operating the machine at these energies over 1 to 2 years . above 500 gev",
    ", the required integrated luminosity will be assumed to increase with the square of the c.m .",
    "this implies about @xmath88 = 125 fb@xmath87 at 800  gev and 500 fb@xmath87 at 1.6  tev .",
    "the polarization of the electron and positron beams is a powerful tool in @xmath0  colliders . at a technical level",
    ", the polarization of the beams can be used to enhance signals and to suppress backgrounds ; quite often , polarized electron beams are sufficient for this purpose . at a deeper level ,",
    "the polarization is of great advantage in performing the microscopic diagnosis of the properties of the fundamental particles , their interactions and the underlying symmetry concepts .",
    "for some specific problems , operating linear colliders in the @xmath89 and the @xmath90 or @xmath91 satellite modes will be very useful .",
    "the high energy photons can be generated by compton back - scattering of laser light on the high energy electron ( and positron ) bunches of the collider .",
    "the luminosities in these modes will be slightly reduced compared with the @xmath0  collisions ; in contrast to electron and positron bunches , electron  photon and photon  photon bunches do not attract each other while electron ",
    "electron bunches even repel each other .",
    "longitudinal and transverse photon polarizations can be generated in compton colliders by choosing the appropriate polarizations of the initial electron / positron and laser @xmath92 beams .",
    "the problems which can be tackled in the @xmath89  @xcite and the @xmath92 @xcite collider modes of the machine , will be addressed in the appropriate physics context .",
    "initial states with exotic lepton quantum numbers are generated in @xmath89  collisions , which are the proper basis for studies of dilepton states , doubly charged higgs bosons and other particles , in particular majorana neutrinos .",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath91 collisions provide one of the most complex test grounds for qcd at high energies . moreover , important aspects of higgs physics and other areas in the electroweak sector can only be studied in @xmath91 collisions .    in many examples the physics potential of @xmath0  linear colliders",
    "will be compared with the results which are expected at the high - energy hadron - collider lhc .",
    "any such comparison can not be complete since only a selected set of processes has been simulated experimentally in detail so far .",
    "however , this set includes most of the problems associated with electroweak symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism , and essential elements of supersymmetry analyses at the lhc .",
    "the lhc comments are based primarily on the material presented in the atlas and cms technical proposals @xcite , analyses of the dpf studies ref.@xcite , and results presented at the lhcc workshop on supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the study of standard model processes at high energy colliders serves several purposes . on the one hand , high - precision analyses of these classical processes can be exploited to determine the properties of the particles in the standard model very accurately , and to detect or set limits on anomalous properties , such as anomalous multipole moments or potentially non - pointlike structures of the particles . on the other hand , standard model reactions are often unwanted background processes , which mask novel reactions predicted in the physical scenarios beyond the standard model  and which should therefore be suppressed as much as possible .    a )    the theoretical basis of the standard processes is familiar from low - energy @xmath0  collider experiments and will not be described in detail here .",
    "the total cross sections are shown in fig.[f1]a for fermion pair production in @xmath0  annihilation : @xmath0  @xmath94 .",
    "these processes are mediated by @xmath95channel @xmath92 and @xmath96 exchanges , except for the bhabha process which can also be generated by @xmath70channel @xmath92 and @xmath96 exchanges .",
    "a cut in the polar angle of the observed electrons and positrons in the final state , @xmath97 corresponding to @xmath98 , has been introduced to remove the rutherford pole ; the size of the cut is slightly larger than the masks for the detector around the beam pipe .",
    "the magnitude of the cross sections , apart from the bhabha process , varies typically between 0.5 and 8 pb at an energy of @xmath99 = 500 gev , corresponding to 2,500 to 15,000 events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath100  @xmath101 .",
    "the cross section for mller scattering follows closely the bhabha cross section .",
    "[ program : comphep ref.@xcite ] .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath0  annihilation to pairs of gauge bosons , @xmath0  @xmath102 and @xmath103 , are presented in the same figure . since the angular distributions peak strongly in the forward / backward directions , the same cut in the polar angle has been adopted as for bhabha events .",
    "the size of the cross sections is similar to that for the fermionic annihilation cross sections .",
    "the corresponding cross sections for initial state photons and mixed electron - photon states are collected in fig.[f1]b : @xmath104 and @xmath105 . [ the cross sections of the @xmath90 and @xmath91 processes are shown for the invariant @xmath106 and @xmath91 energy @xmath99 ; the results for the cross sections after folding with the weizscker  williams and compton back - scattering spectra are discussed later . ]",
    "the same polar - angle cut has been applied as before . moreover ,",
    "the difermion invariant masses in the inelastic compton processes have been restricted to @xmath107 > $ ] 50 gev . though still of similar overall size , the cross sections are in general slightly smaller than the annihilation cross sections for the cuts applied in the present analysis .",
    "b )    the polarization of the electron and positron beams gives a very effective means to control the effect of the standard model processes on the experimental analyses . by choosing the polarizations appropriately , different mechanisms which build up the standard model processes ,",
    "can be switched on and off so that the rates of the various backgrounds can be studied and eventually much reduced .",
    "this is best - known for @xmath108 pair production in @xmath0  annihilation , where the cross section for right - handed electrons is much smaller than the cross section for left - handed electrons .",
    "beam polarization is also an indispensable tool for the identification and study of new ps . and their interactions .",
    "in some cases , the event rates can be increased considerably by choosing the most suitable beam polarization for a specific reaction ; for example , the cross section for higgs production in @xmath109 fusion increases by a factor 4 if the electron and positron beams are polarized . in others ,",
    "the observation of polarization phenomena can add qualitatively new information on the basic properties of particles and interactions ; a well - known example in this context is the analysis of mixed gaugino / higgsino and l / r sfermion states in supersymmetric theories .    in practice",
    ", the degree of polarization of electron beams is expected to be approximately 80% .",
    "polarized positron beams are more difficult to generate , with a degree of polarization presumably in the range of 60% to 65%",
    ".    a few typical examples of standard model processes should illustrate the impact of beam polarizations on the analysis .    .",
    "the dynamical impact of beam polarization on fermion - pair production through the annihilation channel is very modest .",
    "the polarization of the electron determines the polarization of the positron to be opposite in the annihilation process since gauge fields couple chirally flipped particles and antiparticles . moreover ,",
    "since the photon couplings are left / right symmetric , as well as the @xmath96 couplings for electrons / positrons in the axial limit @xmath110 , the polarization does not have a dynamical impact on the total cross sections , but only the statistical weight affects the cross sections .",
    "if @xmath111 is the annihilation cross section for both beams polarized , the cross section for polarized electrons / unpolarized positrons and for both beams unpolarized are both given approximately by @xmath112 .    .",
    "this process is mediated by @xmath70channel @xmath113 exchange , and @xmath95channel @xmath92 and @xmath96 exchanges .",
    "a large fraction of the events is generated in the forward direction by the @xmath70channel @xmath114-exchange mechanism .",
    "choosing right - handedly polarized electrons , this mechanism is switched off .",
    "[ additional left - handed polarization of the positrons is statistically helpful but dynamically not required .",
    "] moreover , the @xmath95channel exchange diagrams are switched off at high energies for right - handedly polarized electrons ; they do not couple to the @xmath115 component of the gauge fields in the intermediate state which is projected out by the charged @xmath108 s in the final state .",
    "the impact of the beam polarization on the differential cross section is demonstrated in fig.[f2 ] where the cross sections for ( partially ) polarized beams are compared with the unpolarized cross section .    .",

    "this assumption can be tested by relating the mass difference between @xmath747 and @xmath748 to the @xmath749 gaugino mass @xmath510 , as shown in fig.[f648 ] ( lower part ) .",

    "however , since the @xmath211parity has no _ a  priori _ justification ,    the possibilities of having either @xmath759 or @xmath760 ( but not both ) should be investigated as well .",
    "if @xmath211parity is broken , the model differs from the mssm in two important features :    \\a ) the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is not protected any more , and it can decay into conventional particles . as a result , the signature of missing energy for mssm processes disappears .",
    "\\b ) supersymmetric ps . can be produced singly in collisions of conventional particles , thus extending the mass range that can be probed for a given energy .",
    "to illustrate a typical case , the production of a single superparticle in @xmath0  collisions may be outlined , fig.[fxr ] , arising from the lepton - number violating term @xmath761 , @xmath762 , @xmath171 @xcite , @xmath763 with the subsequent decays @xmath764 the large number of charged leptons in the final state can be exploited as a characteristic signature in this scenario .",
    "these events should be clearly visible at @xmath0     colliders provided the couplings @xmath765 are sufficiently large .",
    "for example , at @xmath383  gev single chargino production with @xmath766  gev should be observed for @xmath767 and a sneutrino mass in the range of 300 to 600 gev .",
    "depending on the couplings @xmath768 , @xmath769 decays to lepton pairs @xcite    @xmath770 provide signatures that are very easy to detect experimentally .",

    "as one among other physical scenarios , this could be interpreted as a signal of composite substructures of these ps . at a scale of @xmath772  cm",

    "masses and mixing angles are a consequence of the interactions between a small number of elementary constituents  in perfect analogy to the quark / gluon picture of hadrons .",
    "no theoretical formalism has been set up so far which would reconcile , in a satisfactory manner , the small masses in the standard model with the tiny radii of these particles which imply very large kinetic energies of these constituents .",
    "however , the lack of theoretical formalism does not invalidate the physical picture or its motivation .      in this agnostic approach ,",
    "stringent bounds have been derived from high energy scattering experiments on possible non - zero radii of leptons , quarks and gauge bosons from @xmath96 decay data @xcite and bhabha scattering @xcite in @xmath0  collisions , as well as from electron - quark and quark - quark scattering at hera @xcite and the tevatron @xcite , respectively . from these analyses",

    "the ( inverse ) contact scale @xmath776 can be identified , within an uncertainty of a factor of order 3 , with the radius of the electron .",
    "detailed experimental simulations have shown that mller scattering is superior to bhabha scattering in this context , a simple consequence of the bigger cross section in the central rapidity region .",

    ". these high - energy electron - electron scattering experiments will provide us with direct and unambiguous limits on the radius of the electron .",
    "this is in contrast to high - precision @xmath780 and @xmath781 measurements , the interpretation of which depends on dynamical assumptions on the underlying constituent theory .      in compositeness pictures , excited states should be observed with masses of order of the compositeness scale @xmath776 , i.e. @xmath782  tev .",
    "such states can be produced pairwise and singly , generated by the exchange of constituents @xcite : @xmath783 and @xmath784 etc .",

    "the decay modes of the excited states , besides magnetic dipole decays to gauge bosons @xmath787 and @xmath788 , are contact decays @xmath789 and @xmath790 with branching ratios of similar size .",

    "they are novel bound states of subconstituents which build up leptons and quarks in this scenario .",
    "while the size of the couplings to @xmath92 and @xmath96 bosons follows from the electroweak symmetries , the yukawa couplings to leptons and quarks are bound by experiment . in the interesting mass range ,",

    "these ps . can also occur in grand unified theories .",
    "moreover , in supersymmetric theories in which the @xmath211 parity is broken , scalar particles , squarks or sleptons , may be coupled to quarks and leptons , giving rise to production mechanisms and decay signatures analogous to leptoquarks @xcite . however , whereas leptoquarks _ per se _ disintegrate solely to leptons and quarks , a wide variety of decay modes is in general expected for squarks and sleptons , including the large ensemble of standard supersymmetric decay channels , see e.g. @xcite . since leptoquark bound states in the compositeness picture",

    "<S> we describe the physics potential of @xmath0 linear colliders in this report . </S>",
    "<S> these machines are planned to operate in the first phase at a center  of  mass energy of 500  gev , before being scaled up to about 1  tev . in the second phase of the operation </S>",
    "<S> , a final energy of about 2  tev is expected . </S>",
    "<S> the machines will allow us to perform precision tests of the heavy particles in the standard model , the top quark and the electroweak bosons . </S>",
    "<S> they are ideal facilities for exploring the properties of higgs particles , in particular in the intermediate mass range . </S>",
    "<S> new vector bosons and novel matter particles in extended gauge theories can be searched for and studied thoroughly . </S>",
    "<S> the machines provide unique opportunities for the discovery of particles in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , the spectrum of higgs particles , the supersymmetric partners of the electroweak gauge and higgs bosons , and of the matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> high precision analyses of their properties and interactions will allow for extrapolations to energy scales close to the planck scale where gravity becomes significant . in alternative scenarios , like compositeness models , novel matter particles and interactions can be discovered and investigated in the energy range above the existing colliders up to the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> whatever scenario is realized in nature , the discovery potential of @xmath0 linear colliders and the high  precision with which the properties of particles and their interactions can be analysed , define an exciting physics programme complementary to hadron machines .     </S>",
