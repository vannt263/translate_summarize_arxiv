    "almost all wireless communication networks face two different conditions of operation , namely , off - peak hours and peak hours . during the off - peak hours ,",
    "the users do not request much traffic , and accordingly , the network is not crowded .",
    "in contrast , during peak hours , the network is crowded and network capacity limitation becomes of high importance . a promising idea to overcome the difficulties encountered in network operation during peak hours is to cache data at end - user devices memory during off - peak hours , and exploit these cached data at peak hours to relieve network congestion ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .    while this idea looks very attractive , in order to devise efficient network operation protocols in this context , there is the need for understanding the costs and benefits this idea brings to the network . in this regard , recently , a number of papers have analyzed applying this idea to overcome the capacity limitation in wireless networks . in @xcite ,",
    "throughput of cache - enabled large networks for grid and random node placement is investigated , where the cached data has a limited life - time . in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "a new information - theoretic framework for the caching problem is developed .",
    "also , in @xcite , the performance of multi - hopping on a square grid , and the effect of caching , on network performance , is analyzed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite focus on device - to - device caching networks where , for example , in @xcite , the effect of coded multi - casting gain versus spatial reuse gain is investigated .",
    "finally , @xcite considers a single - hop caching network , and considering an interference avoidance strategy , it investigates the optimal throughput - outage trade - off .    in this paper",
    ", we propose another perspective on analyzing caching gain in wireless networks , namely , in the context of multi - user diversity .",
    "consider a wireless network with @xmath0 sources and @xmath0 destinations , communicating in a shared wireless medium .",
    "suppose there exists a pool of data files cached at transmitter nodes , and each receiver is interested in accessing one of such data files .",
    "also , suppose that the wireless channel power gain between sources and destinations are modelled by i.i.d .",
    "random variables  the so - called _ random connections model _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "in such model , random fading of wireless channel is the dominant effect , in contrast to the models where the path loss effect is dominant .",
    "thus , we face a critically interference - limited network , and our objective is to deliver as many files as we can to the destinations .    in previous works ,",
    "two different viewpoints on caching gain are considered . in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite the caching gain",
    "is achieved by exploiting the coded multi - casting gain , while in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , caching gain is exploited via the spatial reuse gain .",
    "in contrast , due to fading dominance in our network channel model , we encounter a critically interference - limited network .",
    "accordingly , we propose to analyze the caching effect in the context of multi - user diversity gain .",
    "this gain is the result of an opportunistic transmission strategy , benefiting from random fluctuations of the wireless channel .",
    "we consider one - hop communications in a cached - enabled wireless network under the random connections model . in our model ,",
    "the sources follow an on - off transmission paradigm , and the receivers use single - user decoding techniques . our proposed transmission strategy ( presented in the form of an algorithm )",
    "is to find out the maximum number of possible transmissions with best channel conditions , in order to maximize the number of successful receptions .",
    "we derive a closed - form scaling expression for the average throughput of a network with heavy - tailed channel power distribution . with the help of such expression",
    ", we explain the trade - off between memory and throughput in a cache - enabled wireless network , where fading is the dominant channel effect .",
    "also , we provide simulations verifying our analytical results .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_model ] , we describe the network model . in section [ sec_strategy ] ,",
    "we present the main algorithm according to which the network transmission strategy is determined .",
    "we analyze network performance in terms of throughput , in section [ sec_throughput ] . in section [ sec_simulations ] , we present simulations and finally , section [ summary ] concludes the paper .",
    "consider a wireless network consisting of @xmath0 source ( provider ) and @xmath0 destination ( client ) nodes .",
    "we denote the source nodes by @xmath1 and the destination nodes by @xmath2 .",
    "consider a pool of @xmath0 data files named @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the destination @xmath4 is interested in accessing the data file @xmath5 from that pool , via one - hop transmission from the sources .",
    "each source @xmath6 has a library of @xmath7 files from the pool , cached in its memory .",
    "thus , each source has the potential to serve one of @xmath7 destinations who request the file available in the source s cache .",
    "we call the set of destinations that can be served by the source @xmath6 as @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for an example of the case @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) . in this paper , we assume that the source caches are filled with the files from the pool randomly in a uniform way , without considering destination requests .",
    "the wireless channel power between source @xmath6 and destination @xmath11 is characterized by the random variable @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the network channel state is completely characterized by the @xmath13 channel power matrix @xmath14 whose elements are @xmath12 .",
    "also , we assume that the elements of @xmath14 are independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) from the distribution @xmath15 ( similar to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , and follow a quasi - static rule .",
    "in other words , the elements of @xmath14 remain fixed during each time slot , and change in the subsequent time slots , independent from other time slots .",
    "the sources are assumed to follow an on - off transmission paradigm . at each time slot ,",
    "a subset of sources will be activated ( with unit power ) , and each of them will send one of the data files from its library , while other sources remain silent in that time slot .",
    "we denote the set of activated sources by @xmath16 .",
    "the set of sources which are active at each time slot ( i.e. @xmath16 ) and the target destination of each source constitute the _ transmission strategy _ of that time slot .",
    "_ transmission strategy _ at each time slot should be determined based on the channel state information ( csi ) encompassed in channel power gain matrix . in this paper , we assume that a centralized supervisor , which has access to full csi , determines the _ transmission strategy_. making this decision in a distributed manner is out of the scope of this paper",
    ".    we assume one - hop transmission conducted during a single time slot , and assume that destinations use only single - user decoding techniques .",
    "thus , in order to have a successful transmission from source @xmath6 to the destination @xmath11 , the receive signal to interference and noise ratio ( @xmath17 ) at @xmath11 should be above a constant threshold level @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , the successful transmission condition from @xmath6 to @xmath11 can be written as : @xmath19    , @xmath10 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the activation strategy is set to @xmath24 .",
    "solid arrows show direct links , while , dashed arrows show interference links .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at each time slot , network throughput @xmath25 is defined as the number of successful transmissions from the sources to the destinations .",
    "since channel power gains are modelled by random variables , network throughput @xmath25 is also a random variable .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the channel power has the following p.d.f . and",
    "c.d.f . , respectively ( similar to @xcite @xcite , and @xcite )",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 exhibits heavy - tailed behaviour . in this paper , we have considered the distribution in ( [ eq_model_pareto_pdf_cdf ] ) since it clearly illustrates the multi - user diversity gain in caching networks , however , the approach used in this paper can be extended to other distributions in a straightforward manner .",
    "in this section , we first illustrate the network operation with a simple example consisting of @xmath9 sources and destinations , then we will present the general formulation .",
    "first , we explain the concept of _ transmission strategy _ in our network setup .",
    "consider the network discussed in fig .",
    "each source has @xmath7 potential destinations , and should first choose one of them at each transmission shot .",
    "we define the _ best destination vector _ @xmath28 as the vector representing chosen destinations for different sources .",
    "suppose we choose the following _ best destination vector _ @xmath29 .",
    "such vector indicates that the source @xmath30 decides to transmit to the destination @xmath31 , the source @xmath32 to the destination @xmath33 , the source @xmath34 to the destination @xmath35 , and the source @xmath36 to the destination @xmath37 ( obviously we need the destination of @xmath6 to be a member of @xmath8 ) . for notational convenience",
    ", we present the _ best destination vector _ by @xmath38 .",
    "so , we have @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .    ideally , we want to activate all sources to transmit the messages requested by their desired destinations , as specified in @xmath28 .",
    "however , due to interference , we can only activate a subset of sources , to ensure successful reception at corresponding destinations .",
    "thus , we should specify which sources should become active by determining the subset of sources belonging to the activated set @xmath16 .",
    "such assignment determines our _ activation strategy_. in the example in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we have set the _ activation strategy _ as @xmath43 .    the pair @xmath44 is defined as the _ transmission strategy _ of the network .",
    "this _ transmission strategy _ should be determined based on the network channel state matrix @xmath14 , and our objective is to have the largest number of successful transmissions .",
    "once the _ transmission strategy _ is clear , the sources send the specified files via a single hop to their intended destinations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in the case of a network with @xmath0 source - destination pairs",
    ", @xmath28 is a @xmath45 vector , and @xmath16 can be any subset of @xmath46 .",
    "also , throughput will be the number of successful transmissions from each source to its destination , and is a function of the activation strategy @xmath44 , along with @xmath14 .",

    "the source @xmath6 compares the power of its direct links towards all its potential destinations ( i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath61 ) and selects the destination with the largest direct link power as its corresponding destination .",
    "this step assigns destination @xmath60 to source @xmath6 , which when completed for all sources , forms @xmath0 source - destination pairs @xmath62 .",
    "the direct link power of the pair @xmath63 is called @xmath64 .",
    "the next step is sorting the power of these direct links ( i.e. @xmath65 ) to derive their order statistics @xmath66 based on the sorted version of direct links ( i.e. @xmath67 ) we can also sort the source - destination pairs . in other words , we can define the following ordering between the source - destination pairs : @xmath68 where the power of direct link of the pair @xmath69 is @xmath70 . in this algorithm , we propose activating the pairs with the most powerful direct links .",
    "thus , we form all the _ source activation strategies _ in which the first @xmath71 most powerful source - destination pairs are activated , where @xmath71 can range from @xmath72 to @xmath0 . in other words , we form @xmath73 subsequently , we select the one which results in the highest throughput @xmath74 where @xmath75 strongest source - destination pairs are activated .",

    "@xmath78 is sent back as the output of the algorithm .",
    "it is interesting to note that we have introduced two stages of sorting in algorithm 1 , in which , we have exploited the most powerful channels .",
    "the first one is while determining the _ best destination vector _ , and the second one is when we determined the _ activation strategy_. these two stages of sorting in algorithm 1 provides multi - user diversity gain for our scheme which will result in high throughput . in the next section",

    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 is an arbitrarily small constant , and @xmath85 characterizes the channel power distribution as indicated in ( [ eq_model_pareto_pdf_cdf ] ) .",
    "since the memory size of each transmitter cache is of order @xmath79 , theorem [ th_analysis_main ] characterizes the trade - off between the memory size and the network throughput via eq .",
    "( [ eq_analysis_theorem ] ) .",
    "define @xmath86 where @xmath84 is an arbitrarily small constant . in order to prove the theorem",
    ", we show that if we activate the first @xmath75 most powerful source - destination pairs , then , on average , the order of @xmath87 of them will be successful .",
    "since algorithm 1 considers activating most powerful source - destination pairs of any size , the case where @xmath75 most powerful pairs are activated will be included in algorithm 1 .",
    "this proves that the algorithm achieves the average throughput of order @xmath87 , where @xmath75 is defined in eq .",

[ lem_direct_power_ineq ] @xmath98",
    "first , we point out the fact that @xmath92 , when properly normalized , is a normal random variable in the following sense : @xmath99 where @xmath100 represents the standard normal random variable , @xmath101 indicates convergence in distribution , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 the above assertion in ( [ eq_analysis_lemma_direct_power_ineq_falk_1 ] ) and ( [ eq_analysis_lemma_direct_power_ineq_falk_2 ] ) is rigorously proved in the appendix .",

    "we arrive at @xmath106 which states that the average number of successful pairs ( i.e. throughput ) is lower bounded by @xmath107 , concluding the proof .",
    "it should be noted that , in the proof of theorem [ th_analysis_main ] we have implicitly assumed that , at the stage of determining the _ best destination vector _ , no destination is chosen by more than one source .",

    "the results are averaged on @xmath112 independent network realizations , each operating based on algorithm 1 .",
    "[ fig3 ] exhibits some important facts .",
    "first , all the three curves ( i.e. @xmath113 vs. @xmath0 ) are linear on the log - log scale .",
    "this is in agreement with our result presented in theorem [ th_analysis_main ] .",
    "the slope of each line should correspond to the scaling exponent of the throughput ( as we will clarify later ) .",
    "second , the smaller values of @xmath85 result in higher throughput ( for the fixed @xmath109 ) . that is due to the fact that by decreasing @xmath85 we will have a heavier tail for the channel power distribution ( see eq . ( [ eq_model_pareto_pdf_cdf ] ) ) . this will result in more multi - user diversity gain in algorithm 1 , which will result in higher throughput .",
    "such throughput increase is also reflected in the slope of each line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which is in agreement with theorem [ th_analysis_main ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , throughput for the same network setting ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is presented for a fixed value of @xmath114 , and different values of memory size , namely @xmath115 , and @xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath116 , and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the same linear behaviour of average throughput versus @xmath0 on the log - log scale is observed in fig .",
    "also , this figure shows that for networks with larger transmitter memory size ( i.e. larger @xmath82 ) we will have higher throughput .",
    "such throughput increase is also reflected in the slope of each line for different values of @xmath82 , as expected from theorem [ th_analysis_main ] .",
    "this phenomenon reflects the trade - off between cache size and throughput .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we verify that the slopes of the lines discussed in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ( i.e. throughput scaling exponents ) agree with what we have derived in theorem [ th_analysis_main ] .",

    "in this paper , we have considered the effect of data caching ability , on the throughput of wireless networks .",

    "also , there remain some important issues and future directions for research , one of which is as follows .",
    "since the proposed scheme relies on multi - user diversity gain , each destination will face delay until being served by some source .",

    "thus , our scheme is fair over a long time span .",
    "however , in networks where such symmetry is violated ( e.g. if the channel power gains are not i.i.d . anymore ) , we should devise protocols to guarantee fairness .",
    "this issue is an interesting future work direction .",
    "from ( [ eq_proposed_sorted_powers ] ) and ( [ eq_analysis_proof_define_r ] ) it can be verified that @xmath92 is the @xmath75th largest value among @xmath126 s .",
    "thus , we can use the following intermediate order statistics lemma to analyze the distribution of @xmath92    [ falk , 1989 , @xcite ] [ lemma_falk ] assume that @xmath127 are i.i.d .",

    "furthermore , one choice for @xmath133 and @xmath135 is : @xmath136    in order to apply lemma [ lemma_falk ] to the random variable @xmath92 , we have to derive @xmath133 for our problem .",
    "the first move is to compute the c.d.f . of the random variable @xmath64 . since in the first step of algorithm 1 ( i.e. determining the _ best destination vector _ ) ,",
