    "the @xmath1 meson is the ground state of the bottom - charm bound system .",
    "its first observation was at the fermilab tevatron by the cdf collaboration in 1998 through the cascade decay @xmath2 and @xmath3  @xcite .    since its discovery",
    ", the @xmath1 meson has attracted more and more attention .",
    "first , because of explicit flavors and the relationship @xmath4 , the strong and electromagnetic decay channels are forbidden , while the weak decay channels are allowed .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 decay offers us an ideal field for studying the weak interaction .",
    "second , the @xmath1 meson consists of two heavy quarks @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they can decay independently , or both of them participate in one process .",
    "thus , compared with @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons , the @xmath1 meson owns more decay channels and a larger final phase space .",
    "third , the mass spectra of @xmath9 and @xmath10 bound states have been extensively studied , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the double - heavy explicit flavored meson spectrum will offer a new circumstance to research the low energy qcd and examine the previous comprehension of the meson structure . in the aspect of experiment ,",
    "the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) has circulated the proton beams since 2009 .",
    "the number of the produced @xmath1 mesons is expected to be @xmath11  @xcite per year when it runs at the highest luminosity @xmath12 @xmath13s@xmath14 and highest energy @xmath15 tev .",
    "so most @xmath1 decay channels will be observed with this huge number .",
    "it is believed that the predictions about the @xmath1 meson in theory will be checked by the experiment data in the near future .    among the channels of the @xmath1 meson transitions ,",
    "the rare decays @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been emphasized recently .",
    "these decays are the single - quark flavor - changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) processes . based on the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani  ( gim )  @xcite mechanism in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "they are forbidden at tree level but induced by electro - weak loop diagrams .",
    "it implies that the sm contribution is greatly suppressed . and ,",
    "as the sm contribution is suppressed , the new physics ( np ) effects may become important .",
    "so studying the rare decays will be helpful to test the sm stringently and detect the np effects indirectly . among these rare decay channels , the semi - leptonic processes",
    "@xmath18 are favored because of their abundant observables , for instance , the differential branching fraction , the forward - backward asymmetry , the longitudinal polarization of the final vector meson , the leptonic longitudinal polarization asymmetry and so on .",
    "more information on the wilson coefficients of the rare decays can be extracted from these observables .    in existing studies ,",
    "the @xmath19 processes have been discussed widely through the @xmath20 decays . in the @xmath20 processes ,",
    "the @xmath19 contribution is dominant , while the annihilation diagrams are ckm suppressed @xmath21 and the spectator scattering effect is at the next @xmath22 order . as shown in  @xcite , by including only the @xmath19 contribution in the sm , the differential branching fractions , the forward - backward asymmetries and the longitudinal polarizations of the final vector mesons are in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "however , in @xmath0 rare decays , the situation is different .",
    "the annihilation diagrams in @xmath0 rare decays are ckm allowed @xmath23 and enhanced by a 3 times larger color factor .",
    "thus , the annihilation contributions should be considered seriously . in this way , the study of the @xmath0 rare decays provides outstanding features .",
    "first , the np effects will be more distinct by considering the annihilation processes . as pointed out in  @xcite , with the help of the interference between the @xmath18 contribution and the sm annihilation contribution",
    ", the predictions of sm with a fourth generation  ( sm4 ) and the super - symmetric  ( susy ) models will deviate stronger from the sm predictions in the processes @xmath24 than in the processes @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath1 rare decays , the particles beyond sm may contribute not only to the @xmath19 transitions but also to the annihilation diagrams .",
    "if so , this double - contribution mechanism may make the np effect more evident .",
    "second , the processes @xmath26 can help us comprehend the large isospin asymmetry phenomenon in the @xmath27 decay .",
    "recently , lhcb @xcite  has reported that the isospin asymmetry  @xmath28 of the @xmath29 process is in agreement with the naive sm expectation of a vanishing asymmetry .",
    "however , in the @xmath30 process , there is a @xmath31 deviation from zero for @xmath28 . even if calculations  @xcite including the annihilation and spectator - scattering diagrams are carried out , the isospin asymmetry of the process @xmath30 is also less than @xmath32 .",
    "one may infer that studying the spectator effects should be emphasized . in the decays",
    "@xmath33 , spectator effects will be obvious based on the particular annihilation mechanism .",
    "so the rare @xmath1 decays can offer a new and helpful field to reveal the reason of the large isospin asymmetry in the @xmath27 decay .    in previous works  @xcite , which include the @xmath16 short - distance contribution and the @xmath34 long - distance diagrams , the @xmath26 and @xmath35 processes",
    "have been calculated , while in refs .",
    "@xcite only the @xmath16 short - distance contribution is considered .",
    "recently , using the annihilation form - factors of @xmath36  @xcite , the @xmath37 transitions combined with the annihilation effects have been analysed in refs .",
    "@xcite . actually , the relationship @xmath38 holds only for the @xmath39 processes .",
    "if the @xmath0 annihilation diagrams are considered , more form - factors will appear .",
    "in the aspect of the long - distance interaction , the papers  @xcite have calculated the color - suppressed cascade diagrams .",
    "the color - suppressed cascade long - distance contribution dominates the @xmath40  processes .",
    "however , both color - suppressed and color - favored long - distance diagrams contribute to @xmath41 processes . furthermore , according to our pervious calculations on the non - leptonic @xmath42 decays  @xcite , the color - favored contributions are almost 3 times larger than the color - suppressed ones .",
    "so besides including the @xmath16 effect , it is motivated to investigate the @xmath43 decays :  ( i )  using the annihilation form - factors of the @xmath0 decays instead of the @xmath44 processes ;  ( ii )  with both the color - suppressed and color - favored long - distance contributions .    to investigate the @xmath43 decays ,",
    "the operator production expansion  ( ope ) mechanism and factorization ansatz can be employed . in this method , the amplitude can be separated into two parts : the short - distance wilson coefficients  ( if the decays involve the resonance cascade processes , extra long - distance terms will appear . ) and the long - distance hadronic matrix elements which are operators sandwiched by the initial and the final states . in the framework of re - normalization group equations  ( rge ) ,",
    "the wilson coefficients can be obtained at next - to - leading  ( nl )  order or next - to - next - to - leading  ( nnl )  order qcd corrections  @xcite perturbatively .",
    "but calculating the hadronic matrix elements is a non - perturbative problem and a model dependent method has to be chosen to do it .",
    "till now , the hadronic matrix elements have been investigated in several approaches : the relativistic constituent quark model @xcite , the light - cone quark model @xcite , the three point qcd sum rules @xcite and the qcd - motivated relativistic quark model @xcite . in this paper , we choose the mandelstam formalism  ( mf ) @xcite and the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation @xcite to investigate the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "this method has several particular features .",
    "first , the bs equation , based on the quantum field theory , is a relativistic equation to describe a two - body bound state . using this method ,",
    "the gaussian wave function is abandoned and a relativistic form of the wave function has been introduced @xcite . in this way , the wave function has the same parity and charge parity as the bound state .",
    "different forms of wave functions denote different states , e.g. , the wave function of a pseudoscalar meson is much different from the one of a vector meson . only in the non - relativistic limit , they are similar @xcite .",
    "second , in the decays @xmath45 , the mass of initial meson @xmath1 is much larger than that of the final meson @xmath46 . as a result , the final meson recoil can be large and the relativistic effect should be taken seriously .",
    "based on the mandelstam formalism , our method keeps the relativistic effect not only from the relativistic wave functions but also from the kinematics  @xcite . at last ,",
    "the weak annihilation amplitude involving the heavy - light meson @xmath7 can be calculated within the heavy quark effective theory  ( hqet )  @xcite under the @xmath47 limit . however , unlike the @xmath7 and @xmath8 meson , the @xmath1 meson consists of two heavy quarks and the relationship @xmath48 is not suitable .",
    "so in this paper , we calculate the annihilation hadronic matrix elements based on the bs method . in our calculation ,",
    "dynamics of both heavy quarks is considered . and our method can be used to deal with not only the double - heavy quark meson but also the heavy - light meson . besides , the weak - annihilation hadronic currents satisfy the gauge - invariance at the @xmath38 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the theoretical details of the effective hamiltonian , hadronic transition matrix elements and the observables of the @xmath43 processes are given . in section 3 ,",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize this paper .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the @xmath0 decays including the short - distance  ( sd ) and long - distance  ( ld )  contributions in the sm .",
    "the sd diagrams contain the penguin , box  ( pb ) diagrams and annihilation  ( ann ) graphs as shown in  figs .  1  ( a ,  b ,  c ) .",
    "the ld parts include the color - suppressed  ( cs ) and the color - favored  ( cf ) contributions as shown in figs .  1  ( d ,  e ) .",
    "we have the effective hamiltonian for annihilation , color - suppressed cascade and color - favored cascade diagrams : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the fermi constant and @xmath51 are willson coefficients . in this paper , when the annihilation , color - suppressed and color - favored cascade diagrams are calculated , the effects of @xmath52 are neglected because of their small wilson coefficients .",
    "the penguin and box diagrams effective hamiltonian , that is , the @xmath53 effective hamiltonian , is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and  @xmath56 are the ckm matrix elements .",
    "the set of local operators is @xcite : @xmath57 for @xmath53 processes , with the help of rge  @xcite approach , @xmath58 are linear combinations of according @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the operators @xmath61 themselves have matrix elements that contribute to @xmath62 and the perturbative parts can be included into @xmath63 . in our calculation , considering that the effect of @xmath64 belongs to the higher @xmath22 order , we do not include its contribution .",
    "thus , the amplitude induced by effective hamiltonian is shown as : @xmath65\\bar{l}\\gamma^{\\mu}l+c_{10}w_{\\mu}\\bar{l}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma_5l\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in the above equation , we have defined the hadronic matrix elements @xmath66 and @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are momenta of the initial and final mesons , respectively .",
    "the antisymmetric tensor is defined as @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath72 is the mass of @xmath6 quark .",
    "the effective wilson coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 are defined as : @xmath75 where @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 and @xmath79 describe the contributions of the four - fermi operator @xmath61 loops . in refs",
    "@xcite , with the help of rge , the wilson coefficients @xmath80 are evolved from @xmath81 scale to the @xmath72 scale . in this paper , we adopt the same expressions of @xmath82 functions and the same numerical values of the wilson coefficients as those in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the annihilation diagrams , according to the naive factorization",
    ", we write the amplitude as : @xmath83 where in the second equality the fierz - arrangement identity is employed .",
    "the annihilation hadronic matrix elements can be expressed as:@xmath84 in the above equation , @xmath85 are defined as : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are momenta and masses of the propagated quarks , respectively .",
    "the ld processes considered in this paper are those that are induced by the resonance cascade decays , i.e , @xmath89 , whose contributions can be described by the relationship @xmath90 approximately .",
    "( the relationship written here is not used to compute any observables in this paper but just employed to make the following sentences transparent . )",
    "the resonances @xmath91 denote @xmath92 mesons which could be the @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 bound states . during our calculation",
    ", we ignore the effects of the @xmath97 cascade decays .",
    "on one hand , the strong decays allowed by okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rules are the dominant channels of the @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 mesons , while the strong decays of @xmath101 are suppressed by ozi rules .",
    "so the processes @xmath102 which are induced by electromagnetic interaction have much smaller branching fractions than @xmath103 . on the other hand , considering the small ckm matrix elements @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the branching fractions of @xmath106 processes will be suppressed . and",
    "because of the small wilson coefficients @xmath107 , the numerical values of @xmath108 are small .",
    "so we calculate only the @xmath109 processes in this paper .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , the propagator of @xmath91 can be written in the breit - wigner form .",
    "so , from the naive factorization , the amplitude can be written as : @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 and @xmath113 are the mass and width of the resonance meson , respectively . from fierz - arrangement identity and naive factorization",
    ", we write the hadronic matrix element @xmath114 as : @xmath115 where on the right side of the above equation , the first term is from the cs diagram and the second term gives the cf contribution .",
    "if only the cs and @xmath16 contributions are included , our amplitude @xmath116 will be similar with those in refs .",
    "taking account of the unitarity condition on the elastic breit - wigner resonance amplitude  @xcite , we take @xmath117 in this paper .    to simplify the calculation ,",
    "we define : @xmath118 where in the second step the relationship @xmath119 is used . and",

    "the theoretical uncertainties are estimated including two aspects . on one hand ,",
    "theoretical uncertainties caused by bs - model dependent parameters are studied .",
    "this kind of errors is calculated by changing the numerical values of our model dependent parameters by @xmath241 , which include the masses of constituent quarks and the cornell - potential - parameters .",
    "we find that , in bs method , the observables are more sensitive to @xmath230 and @xmath233 than the other bs - model dependent parameters .    on the other hand , the systematic uncertainties which the naive factorisation hypothesis arouses are investigated . in the investigation of @xmath242 processes , to include non - factorisable contributions of ld cascade processes @xmath243 , the @xmath244 factor which is determined by comparing the experimental data with the theoretical results is introduced frequently  @xcite .",
    "however , the situation in @xmath245 is different .",
    "the cascade processes @xmath243 include only cs contributions and the @xmath244 factor can be used to include the non - factorisable effects of cs diagrams , but transitions @xmath245 contain both cs and cf diagrams .",
    "thus , another way is adopted in this paper . in the previous calculations on the non - leptonic decays of @xmath7 meson  @xcite , to contain the non - factorisable contributions , the number of colors @xmath246 in the expression @xmath247 or @xmath248 is treated as parameter which should be obtained by fitting the experimental data , i.e , the effective number of colors . however , the @xmath1 meson which consists two heavy quarks is much different from @xmath7 meson .",
    "so the parameters constrained by @xmath7 experimental data are not chosen to use in this paper . and",
    "considering that at present the data on @xmath1 non - leptonic decays are still lacking , we calculate the observables with @xmath249 but for estimating the systematic uncertainties which are aroused by non - factorisable contributions in the the processes @xmath245 , we change the numerical values of @xmath246 in eq .",

    "for instance , as shown in figs .  6  ( c )",
    ", @xmath226 including only the pb diagrams has tiny theoretical uncertainty .",

    "if only pb contributions are considered , we have the relationships @xmath251 and @xmath252 . considering that @xmath73 has a small value , we can write the relationship @xmath253 approximately . if @xmath254 is considered , as shown in eq .",

    "so the ratio , that is , @xmath226 , has tiny theoretical uncertainty .",
    "if ann , cs and cf contributions are added , @xmath258 will be affected by not only the numerical values of @xmath246 but also the ann and cf form - factors , which can not be neglected .",
