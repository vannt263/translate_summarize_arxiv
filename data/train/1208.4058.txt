    "the interaction of heavy - flavored hadrons with ordinary hadrons like nucleons and light mesons is focus of great contemporary interest in different contexts .",
    "one focus of interest is in experiments of relativistic heavy ion collisions . in  heavy ion experiments , charm and bottom quarks",
    "are produced in the initial stages of the collision by hard scattering processes .",
    "since they are much heavier than the light partons making up the bulk of the matter produced in the collision , it is likely that they will not equilibrate with the surrounding matter and therefore they might be ideal probes of properties of the expanding medium  for a recent review on the subject and an extensive list of references see ref .",
    "however , the heavy quarks will eventually hadronize and information on the medium will be carried out of the system by heavy - flavored hadrons . in their way out of the system , the heavy - flavored hadrons will interact with the more abundant light - flavored hadrons and a good understanding of the interaction is crucial for a reliable interpretation of experimental data .",
    "another focus of interest is an exciting physics program that will be carried out with the @xmath9  gev upgrade of the cebaf accelerator at the jefferson lab in the usa and the construction of the fair facility in germany . at the jefferson lab",
    "charmed hadrons will be produced by scattering electrons off nuclei and at fair they will be produced by the annihilation of antiprotons on nuclei .",
    "one particularly exciting perspective is the possibility of creating new exotic nuclear bound states by nuclei capturing charmonia states like @xmath10 and @xmath11  , or heavy - light @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons  .",
    "in addition , the quest for experimental signals of chiral symmetry restoration in matter is a subject of immense current interest and open - charm @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons are expected to play an important role in this respect  for a recent review , see ref .  @xcite . in @xmath12 mesons ,",
    "properties of the light constituent quarks determined by dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath14sb ) , like masses and magnetic moments , are sensitive to the surrounding environment and changes in such properties will impact the structure and interactions of the mesons in medium .",
    "evidently , a prerequisite for reliable predictions of modifications of hadron properties in medium is a good understanding of the free - space interaction of these hadrons .",
    "knowledge of the interaction in free space is also essential for guiding future experiments aiming at producing exotic bound states and measuring in - medium hadron properties .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the low - energy interaction of @xmath15 mesons with nucleons in free space .",
    "there is a complete lack of experimental information on this reaction , all of what is presently known about the interaction in free space has been apprehended from model calculations based on hadronic lagrangians motivated by flavor @xmath16 symmetry  , models using hadron and quark degrees of freedom  @xcite and heavy - quark symmetry  , and the nonrelativistic quark model  @xcite .",
    "although the first lattice qcd studies of the interaction of charmed hadrons like @xmath10 and @xmath11 with nucleons are starting to appear in the literature  , the @xmath17 interaction does not seem to have been considered by the lattice community . in view of this situation , the use of models seems to be the only alternative for making the urgently needed predictions for e.g. low - energy cross sections of reactions involving charmed hadrons .",
    "however , as advocated in the works of refs .  , minimally reliable predictions of unknown cross - sections need to be founded on models constrained as much as possible by symmetry arguments , analogies with other similar processes , and the use of different degrees of freedom . in the specific case of the @xmath0 reaction , ref .",
    "@xcite extended a very successful model for the @xmath18 reaction  @xcite , in which the long - range part of the interaction is described within a meson - exchange framework  @xcite and the short - distance part is described by a quark - interchange mechanism from one - gluon - exchange  ( oge ) of a nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm )  .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite describes the available low - energy experimental data for the @xmath18 reaction and was used to set limits on the width of the hypothetical @xmath19 pentaquark state  @xcite . for the @xmath17 reaction",
    ", the model predicts cross - sections that are on average of the same order of magnitude but larger by a factor roughly equal to @xmath20 than those of the analogous @xmath5 and @xmath21 reactions for center - of - mass kinetic energies up to @xmath22  mev .",
    "two interesting findings of the study of ref .",
    "@xcite are noteworthy : ( 1 ) quark interchange contributes about the same amount as meson exchanges to the @xmath0 @xmath23-wave phase shifts , and ( 2 ) among the meson exchanges processes , scalar ( @xmath1 ) and vector ( @xmath3,@xmath2 ) are the most important contributors ",
    "single @xmath24 , @xmath25 baryon - exchange diagrams and higher - order box diagrams involving @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 intermediate states contribute very little .",
    "recall that single - pion exchange is absent in this reaction .",
    "the same model was also used to examine the possibility to extract information on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 interactions in an antiproton annihilation on the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the fact that quark - interchange plays a prominent role in the @xmath31 reaction is very significant to the quest of experimental signals of chiral symmetry restoration via changes in the interactions of @xmath32 mesons in matter .",
    "as  said , such changes would be driven at the microscopic level by modifications of the properties of the light @xmath33 and @xmath34 constituent quarks . however , within a nrqm there is no direct way to link d@xmath14sb in medium and the effective hadron - hadron interactions , since constituent quark masses and microscopic interactions at the quark level are specified independently in the model  @xcite . also , any temperature or density dependence on constituent quark masses has to be postulated in an _ ad hoc _ manner   to account for effects of d@xmath14sb restoration . as a step",
    "to remedy this limitation of the nrqm , in the present paper we use a model that realizes d@xmath14sb in a way that the same microscopic interaction that drives d@xmath14sb also confines the quarks and antiquarks into color singlet hadronic states , and in addition is the source of the hadron - hadron interaction .",
    "the model is defined by a microscopic hamiltonian inspired in the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge , in that an infrared divergent interaction models the full non - abelian color coulomb kernel in qcd and leads to hadron bound states that are color singlets  the hamiltonian also contains an infrared finite interaction to model transverse - gluon interactions and leads to , among other effects , hyperfine splittings of hadrons masses  .",
    "we implement an approximation scheme that allows to calculate with little computational effort variational hadron wave functions and effective hadron - hadron interactions that can be iterated in a lippmann - schwinger equation to calculate phase shifts and cross - sections .",
    "an early calculation of the @xmath18 interaction within such a model , but using a confining interaction only was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organizes as follows . in the next section we present the microscopic quark - antiquark hamiltonian of the model .",
    "we discuss d@xmath14sb in the context of two models for the infrared divergent potentials that mimic full non - abelian color coulomb kernel in qcd , and obtain numerical solutions of the constituent quark mass function for different current quark masses . in section  [ sec : qm ] we discuss a calculation scheme for deriving effective low - energy hadron - hadron interactions within the context of the hamiltonian of the model .",
    "a low - momentum expansion of the quark mass function is used to obtain variational meson and baryon wave functions and explicit , analytical expressions for the effective meson - baryon potential . in section  [ sec : num ] we present numerical results for phase shifts and cross sections for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 and @xmath35 and @xmath8 reactions at low energies .",
    "initially we use the short - ranged quark - interchange potential derived within the model and add potentials from one - meson exchanges to fit experimental @xmath36wave phase shifts of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions .",
    "next , without introducing new parameters , we present the predictions of the model for the @xmath35 and @xmath8 reactions . our conclusions and perspectives are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",

    "this is not the case for the similar problems involving strange hadrons . in a situation of lack of experimental information ,",
    "one way to proceed in model building is to use symmetry constraints , analogies with other similar processes , and the use of different degrees of freedom  .",

    "the model hamiltonian , defined in eqs .",
    "( [ h])-([dij ] ) , confines color and realizes d@xmath14sb .",
    "the scheme makes contact with traditional constituent quark models  @xcite , but it goes beyond such models : the constituent quark masses are derived from the very same interactions that lead to hadron bound states and hadron - hadron interactions , while in the traditional quark models , quark masses and quark - quark interactions are specified independently . moreover , the model confines color , in that only color - singlet hadron states are of finite energy .",
    "these features of the model are essential for studies seeking signals of in - medium modifications of hadron properties .",
    "the model hamiltonian requires as input a coulomb - like term @xmath48 and a transverse - gluon interaction @xmath80 .",

    "for @xmath80 we were guided by previous studies of spin - hyperfine splittings of meson masses  @xcite .",
    "initially we obtained the constituent quark mass function @xmath70 for different flavors  @xmath71 .",
    "next , we derived an effective low - energy meson - baryon interaction from a quark - interchange mechanism , whose input is the microscopic hamiltonian and hadron bound state wave functions given in terms of quark degrees of freedom  .",
    "we  derived explicit analytical expressions for the effective meson - baryon interaction by using a low - momentum expansion of the constituent quark mass function and variational hadron wave functions  .",
    "initially we used the short - ranged quark - interchange potential derived within the model and added one - meson - exchange potentials to fit experimental @xmath36wave phase shifts of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions .",
    "next , without changing any parameters besides the strange to charm current quark masses , @xmath223 , we presented the predictions of the model for the @xmath35 and @xmath8 reactions .",

    "however , the shapes of the curves for the @xmath204 cross sections from model  1 and model  2 are different at very low energies from those from oge  a feature we attribute to the drastically different momentum dependences of @xmath74 and @xmath221 from the @xmath222 dependence of the oge .    the model can be improved in several directions .",
    "first of all , without sacrificing the ability of obtaining analytical expressions for the effective meson - baryon interaction , one can expand the the amplitudes @xmath129 and @xmath130 in a basis of several gaussians and diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian matrix together with a variational determination of the size parameters of the gaussians .",
    "another improvement , that certainly will be necessary for studying in - medium chiral symmetry restoration , is to use the full mass function @xmath70 for the light @xmath33 and @xmath34 flavors , instead of the low - momentum expansion of eq .",
    "( [ mk - app ] ) . this is because at finite baryon density and/or temperature the mass function @xmath70 for @xmath225 will loses strength in the infrared   and the expansion in powers of @xmath226 evidently loses validity .",
    "however , this will have a slight impact on the numerics , since in this case multidimensional integrals for the determination of the hadron sizes and the effective meson - baryon interaction need to be performed numerically .",
    "the low - momentum expansion must also be abandoned in the calculation of hadron wave functions when the quark mass function @xmath70 in the infrared is much smaller than the average momentum of the quark in the hadron .",
    "such a situation can happen when @xmath75 is suppressed in the infrared , as in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the low - energy elastic @xmath0 interaction using a quark model that confines color and realizes dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined by a microscopic hamiltonian inspired in the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge . </S>",
    "<S> constituent quark masses are obtained by solving a gap equation and baryon and meson bound - state wave functions are obtained using a variational method . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a low energy meson - nucleon potential from a quark - interchange mechanism whose ingredients are the quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions and baryon and meson wave functions , all derived from the same microscopic hamiltonian . the model is supplemented with ( @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 ,  @xmath3 ,  @xmath4 ) single - meson exchanges to describe the long - range part of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> cross - sections and phase shifts are obtained by iterating the quark - interchange plus meson - exchange potentials in a lippmann - schwinger equation . once model parameters in meson exchange potential are fixed to describe the low - energy experimental phase shifts of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions , predictions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 reactions are obtained without introducing new parameters . </S>"
