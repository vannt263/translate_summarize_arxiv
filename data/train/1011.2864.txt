    "it is possible that the behavior of @xmath49 in the @xmath4  and @xmath1  relations stems from an increase in the intrinsic scatter at low @xmath13 related to the properties of their stellar disks or their parent dark matter halos .",
    "while this is a tantalizing possibility at the outset , it is difficult to  tune \" galaxy formation models of the type described in  [ gal_form ] to increase the scatter in the @xmath4  and @xmath1  relations without increasing that in the @xmath0  relation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "[ incompleteness ] , incompleteness is the most likely culprit . since some of the data included in the sfi++ stem from aperture diameter - limited surveys ( especially among the fainter , more nearby galaxies ) , we expect incompleteness to reduce the scatter at the faint end of the @xmath0  relation in analogy the @xmath4  relation behaviour determined by m06 for the sfi++ template .",
    "in  [ vrl ] we present @xmath1  and @xmath0  relations that exhibit significantly smaller scatter than has been previously reported , which we attribute to our adoption of an inclination - corrected isophotal radius as the size parameter @xmath12 in these relations rather than a disk scale - length . here , we discuss the implications of this reduced scatter for two common scaling relation applications : redshift - independent distances and galaxy formation models .    while it is obvious that the ideal samples to be used as distance indicators and galaxy formation constraints differ , it is equally obvious that these ideal samples are not yet available .",

    "this simple analysis suggests that the range of @xmath136 and @xmath129 in spiral galaxies is significantly smaller than previously estimated : for example , our upper limit on the scatter in @xmath136 is a factor of @xmath161 smaller than that found by @xcite , because @xmath98 in our @xmath0  relation scatter is significantly smaller than that of the one they model .",
    "more importantly , @xmath162 is a factor of 6.7 smaller than @xmath163 found from cosmological simulations @xcite : to illustrate , the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ rlmod ] shows the expected scatter in the case where @xmath164 .",
    "it is possible that the distribution of specific angular momentum @xmath165 in disk galaxies has less scatter than that of their host halos , perhaps due to a redistribution of angular momentum through bulge formation .",
    "this was explored by @xcite , but their bulge formation scenario reduces the @xmath0  scatter by at most @xmath166 for realistic bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that angular momentum redistribution is responsible for the narrow range of @xmath136 required by our model , particularly for the sc - dominated sfi++ .",
    "another possibility is that disk galaxies form in a subset of halos with a distribution of spin parameters that is different from that in the halo population as a whole .",
    "some studies suggest that this is the case : halos with a quiet merger history in the simulations of @xcite have both lower @xmath167 and @xmath168 than found for all halos .",
    "this possibility has been previously discussed in the context of scaling relation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is unclear whether this effect can explain the extremely small range of @xmath141 implied by our @xmath0  relation : once the scatter from other parameters such as @xmath147 and @xmath127 are taken into account , the allowed scatter on @xmath136 may well be an _ order of magnitude _ smaller than that predicted for @xmath141 from cosmological expectations .",
    "of all the disk galaxy scaling relations , the @xmath4  ( i.e. tully - fisher ) relation has by far received the most attention .",
    "it has been used to compute distances to galaxies in the nearby universe and study the local velocity field , and to put constraints on models of galaxy formation , using data at different wavelengths and at both low and high redshift . while the @xmath0  and @xmath1  relations can in theory",
    "serve similar purposes , the large scatter in previously published versions of these relations is prohibitive .    with close to 5000 galaxies ,",
    "the sfi++ is one of the largest available samples to study disk galaxy scaling relations .",
    "the main advantage of the sample is the large range of carefully measured parameters available , and the well - studied uncertainties associated with them .",
    "homogeneous rotation velocities and @xmath169band luminosities were published by s07 , and the sfi++ @xmath4  template relation studied in detail by m06 .",
    "in addition to estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath6 , measures of disk size @xmath12 are also available for a subset of the catalog .",
    "it is therefore possible to construct the full suite of @xmath17 scaling relations from the sfi++ .    in this paper",
    ", we have presented the @xmath4 , @xmath1  and @xmath0  relations for subsets of the template and nontemplate sfi++ samples . because the sfi++ @xmath4  relation has been extensively studied ,",
    "we focus on the @xmath1  and @xmath0  relations .",
    "contrary to previous studies , we adopt inclination - corrected isophotal radii rather than disk scale - lengths as a measure of the disk size @xmath12 . while scale - length - based studies report an observed scatter for the @xmath0  relation of @xmath170 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* p05 , c07 ) , we find @xmath171 . with @xmath172 and a correlation coefficient of @xmath173 ,",
    "our @xmath1  relation is also significantly tighter than previously found .",
    "we demonstrate that the drastically tighter relations and lower scatters reported here stem from our use of isophotal radii , and argue that they are superior to measured scale - lengths because they are less susceptible to measurement errors and can be more reliably corrected for internal extinction .",
    "we examine and interpret the morphological dependence of the scaling relations as well as the properties of their residuals .",
    "after carefully accounting for all known sources of measurement error and their covariances , we retrieve the amount of intrinsic scatter in each of the relations .",
    "our error budgets are consistent with constant intrinsic scatter @xmath98 at high @xmath6 and high @xmath13 , with values @xmath174mag , @xmath175 and @xmath176 for the @xmath4 , @xmath1  and @xmath0  relations , respectively .",
    "the scatter of the @xmath4  and @xmath1  relations however increases strongly at low @xmath13 . while this likely",
    "reflects enhanced intrinsic scatter in @xmath13 , the effect is difficult to quantify due to the competing contributions of peculiar velocities , sample incompleteness and measurement errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the scatter in the @xmath0  relation decreases slightly at low @xmath6 , consistent with the behavior of an incompleteness bias .",
    "we investigate the possible application of the @xmath1  relation as a distance indicator . comparing with the cepheid variable distances available for 17 galaxies in the template subsample",
    ", we find that the @xmath1  relation returns distances with a median precision of 25% .",
    "this is slightly inferior to the 15 - 20% accuracy of @xmath4  relation distances typically reported .",
    "we suggest that @xmath1  distances are nonetheless accurate enough to provide a valid substitute when precise integrated magnitudes are not available .",
    "we find that the uncertainties on @xmath15 derived by matching the zero points of the @xmath1  relations for the template subsample and cepheid variable sample are comparable to those obtained using the @xmath4  relation : in both cases , the uncertainties on the cepheid distance zero point dominate .    to illustrate the potential of the sfi++ scaling relations to constrain the formation of sc galaxies , we apply a simple , mmw98-style galaxy formation model to the nontemplate @xmath0  relation .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic scatter in our measured isophotal radii equals that of the predicted scale - lengths of the stellar mass distribution , we find an upper limit on the scatter of the disk spin parameter that is 3 times smaller than previously reported , and 6.7 times smaller than the distribution of halo spin parameters predicted by cosmological simulations . as it is unlikely that angular momentum redistribution due to bulge",
    "formation can account for this difference , we suggest that the subset of halos in which sc galaxies form has a much smaller spread in spin parameters than the broader halo population .",
