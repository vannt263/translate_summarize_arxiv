    "emission below 10kev can be due to a combination of thermal emission from the disk , and non - thermal emission from a corona .",
    "it is difficult to study disks through their continuum spectra , so the most pragmatic way to study the disk is to use broad @xmath4@xmath6 emission lines .",
    "this line ( as the reflection component that we will explain later ) arises from the fluorescence of the inner disk from an irradiating source of high energy emission ( george & fabian , 1991 ) .",
    "depending on the ionization state of the disk this line is centered at 6.4 - 6.97kev . from the study of the profiles of these lines , it can be inferred the spin of the black hole , which can be between zero for an schwarzchild black hole ( fabian et  al . , 1989 ) to a maximally rotating regime in the case of a kerr black hole ( laor , 1991 ) . in the hard x - ray emission ( @xmath7kev )",
    "a spectral hump usually appears , called the reflection bump , with the same origin .",
    "thus , both reflection and broad @xmath4 @xmath5 line should appear together during the observations .",
    "nevertheless , both effects are inhibited when a high ionization degree occurs , because the disk becomes a perfect reflector of the @xmath0-rays ( ross et  al.1999 ) .",
    "current observations of relativistic lines suggest that a range of black hole spin parameters may be seen ( for reviews , see miller 2007 and nandra et al . 2007 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to take relativistic effects into account by fitting spectra with the appropriate line and reflection models .",
    "inner disks can get very close to the black hole ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) and this would imply a very concentrated source for the high energy emission , i.e. , the high energy source has to be centrally compact .",
    "in the most accepted picture for the black hole states ( tanaka & lewin , 1995 ) the classification arises from the characterization of x - ray emission ( usually a multicolor black body with an inner disk temperature of @xmath10kev ) and hard x - ray emission ( @xmath11kev ) , the last best phenomenologically described by a power - law .",
    "the high / soft state is characterized by strong disk emission ( @xmath12 ) and an steep power - law ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the low / hard state has almost no disk emission and the power - law dominates the spectrum ( @xmath14 ) . during the steep power law state",
    "both disk and power - law emission are important , although @xmath15 is steep . during the evolution along the outburst",
    "some transitional states appear , called intermediate ( homan & belloni , 2005 ) with characteristics of both low / hard and high / soft states , depending on the case .",
    "grove et  al.(1998 ) , on the basis of cgro observations , proposed that the high / soft state of black holes is associated with an unbroken powerlaw , usually understood as non - thermal origin of the high energy emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the low / hard state was associated with an spectral cut - off at 100kev ( coinciding with the kinetic temperature of the thermal distribution of the -inverse- comptonizing electrons ) , implying a thermal origin for the high energy emission .",
    "sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) proposed a thermal corona being the source of the high energy emission from black - holes . some years later , esin et al.(1997 ) proposed the standard disk plus coronae model . in this model",
    ", the inner disk goes inwards while the outburst evolves from the low / hard to the high / soft states .",
    "an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) corona fills the inner regions of the disk , providing the ( inverse ) comptonizing electrons .",
    "the disk provides the photons to be comptonized .",
    "this was considered to be the source of the high energy emission during the last 30 years .",
    "however , the above mentioned model has several drawbacks .",
    "the first one is that the standard model can not explain the qpos ( quasi periodic oscillations ) behaviour .",
    "qpos are the highest frequency oscillations in black holes ( typically between 140 and 450 hz ) which are commensurate with keplerian orbital frequencies at the isco ( inermost stable circular orbit ) .",
    "x - rays qpos appear in the low / hard state , are maintained in the intermediate states and are quenched in the high / soft state ( see review by van der klis , 2004 ) .",
    "also , there is an strong coupling between hard x - rays and radio emission , difficult to understand without taking into account hard x - ray emission from a jet .",
    "as can be seen in a recent review from fender et  al.(2004 ) , black holes in the low / hard state show radio emission in the form of a steady jet with a low value for the lorentz factor ( @xmath16 ) . during the intermediate state",
    "the radio emission is variable and @xmath15 is higher . in the steep power law state",
    "the radio emission is optically thin with a high value of @xmath17 . in the high / soft state",
    "the radio emission is quenched .",
    "while the proposed scenario in fender et  al.(2004 ) would be consistent with the first point of the standard model proposed by esin et",
    "al.(1997 ) , the source of the high energy emission in the low / hard state is still debated .",
    "the base of jets have been proposed to be the source of the high energy emission markoff et  al.(2001 ) , markoff et  al.(2003 ) and markoff et  al.(2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the model of markoff is only dedicated to hard x - ray domain ( @xmath18kev ) .",
    "coppi ( 1999 ) developed the eqpair hybrid thermal / non - thermal ( inverse ) comptonization model .",
    "this model can explain the excess ( with respect a pure thermal model ) of the high energy emission already observed in black hole states during the high / soft state ( @xmath19kev ) .",
    "the physical mechanism of this model is that ( inverse ) comptonization from a hybrid thermal and non - thermal distribution of particles ( leptons ) is the source of the high energy emission .",
    "the most important consequences of this model are both the disappearing of high energy cut - offs when the distribution of particles is highly non - thermal and the presence of the anihilation line at 511kev .",
    "this line results from the anihilation of relativistic @xmath20 pairs in mildly relativistic and non - thermal distributed plasmas .",
    "integral and glast are key missions in the detection of this line .",
    "several attemps have been attempted to detect this line from microquasars but still there are not fiducial detections ( guessoum et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "we think that this line , if detected , would confirm the hypothesis of the source of the high energy emission being highly concentrated and relativistic",
    ". these conditions would be the typical of the base of a jet .",
    "although this model seems to be very promising it deals only with static coronae and , as shown in beloborodov ( 1999 ) , if particles of the plasma acquire high velocities ( @xmath21 ) , the high energy radiation is highly anisotropic .",
    "gro  j1655@xmath140 is a black hole transient discovered on 1994 july with the cgro satellite ( zhang et  al . , 1994 ) . it is a lmxb with a black hole of mass @xmath22 ( orosz & bailyn , 1997 ) . the inclination of the system is @xmath23 ( van der hooft , 1998 ) although the inclination of the inner disk would be as high as @xmath24 .",
    "this system may harbor a maximal spinning black hole ( @xmath25 ) , indicating an inner radius of @xmath26@xmath9 ( miller et  al . , 2005 ) .",
    "strong qpos are detected ( 300 - 450hz ) ( strohmayer , 2001 ) and extremely relativistic radio jets have been detected in radio ( hjellming & rupen , 1995 ) .",
    "tomsick et  al.(1999 ) did the former detection of unbroken powerlaw emission up to 800kev during the low / hard state .",
    "integral observations during the 2005 outburst were done up to 500kev during the low / hard state ( caballero - garca et  al . , 2007 ) .",
    "in this work , the low / hard state was modeled using both simple models like a power - law , and using eqpair .",
    "the lack of a break in fits with the simple power - law implies that non - thermal comptonization may dominate the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "additional modeling with eqpair confirms that non - thermal comptonization is best able to explain the observed spectrum .",
    "this work suggested thermal comptonization processes not being the main source for the high energy emission of gro  j1655@xmath140 .",
    "however , more work is needed to disentangle the source of the high energy emission , and integral observations are planned for a broad sample of black hole transients .",
