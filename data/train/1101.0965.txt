    "while lacking an extended x - ray halo , the bulk of diffuse emission is confined to the central region and is generally consistent with the distribution of irac 8.0 non - stellar emission .",
    "the elongated feature of x - ray diffuse emission has previously been noticed by terashima et al .",

    "spectra of the nuclear region are extracted from a 8-arcsec circular aperture centered at the surface brightness peak of the continuum .",
    "the mid - infrared emission in ngc 4278 is extended , we need to use slit loss correction function ( slcf here after ) to correct the original flux calibration provided by ssc based on point - source , which overestimates the flux by neglecting the flux accepted from outside the slit .",
    "currently the slcf is built on a simple assumption that the extended emission is uniform and unlimitedly extended ( smith et al . 2007a ) .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption is not well satisfied in the case of ngc 4278 , which shows a considerable degree of surface brightness concentration .",
    "the application of the slcf leads to two artifacts in the spectra .",
    "first , a significant mismatch appears at the boundary of sl2 and ll1 , where flux density of sl1 is @xmath32 higher than ll2 .",
    "this mismatch happens because the slit width and pixel size in ll module is nearly threes times as in sl . at the same wavelength , the slcf would overcorrect ll spectra in comparison with sl , because the real `` excess '' flux coming from outside the slit is relatively less in ll due to concentration of the extended emission .",
    "another artifact would be more complex .",
    "since the slcf depends on psf sizes at different wavelengths , application of this correction would modify the spectral profile .",
    "we estimate these two effects by following steps .",
    "first , we directly match ll to sl by multiplication , this spectrum will be referred as `` matched spectrum '' hereby .",
    "second , we disable the slcf for ll spectra , this would elevate ll spectra by about @xmath33 at the blue end , thus fill the gap between sl and ll , then we do a minor adjustment to scale ll to sl by multiplication .",
    "the resulted spectrum is called `` uncorrected spectrum '' hereby.the two spectra are shown in figure 12 . the disagreement between the two",
    "spectra is lower than @xmath34 blueward of @xmath35 but becomes significant at longer wavelengths . in this work ,",
    "three lines of interest , h@xmath0 s(0 ) , [ siii]@xmath36 and [ siii]@xmath27 , fall on wavelengths longer than @xmath35 , discussions depending on relative strengths involved with these lines will be treated with caution .",
    "we further compared the spectra with irac and mips photometry results derived from a same aperture .",
    "for the data reduction of irac data , we started from the bcd images and followed the same steps as we did in tang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , for mips data , we started from the post - bcd image .",
    "we employed the extended source aperture correction for calibration developed by tom jarrett . for mips image , unfortunately , such a correction is not available .",
    "thus we only give an estimation of lower and upper limit from the data .",
    "the lower limit is derived by directly integrating the counts within the aperture without an aperture correction , while the upper limit is derived by employing an aperture correction for point source , as provided in mips instrument hand book , since such an aperture correction ignores the diffraction light from outside the aperture , it would over - estimate the real flux .",
    "the results are shown in figure 12 .",
    "the irac photometry points are consistent with our spectra within calibration uncertainty ( @xmath37 , fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , indicating the flux calibration based on slcf is reliable for sl observations .",
    "the mips photometry data fails to help distinguish between the matched spectrum and the uncorrected spectrum .",
    "hereafter , we will carry out discussions based on results from the uncorrected spectrum , since the mismatch between the sl and ll modules indicates that the slcf correction based on the assumption of uniform extended source is not proper for ll observations .",
    "we caution the readers that this approach is not a precise solution .",
    "nevertheless , this will not bring significant influence on the spectral shape shortward of @xmath35 , although might overestimate lines flux by no larger than @xmath38 at the longest wavelength ( for [ siii]@xmath27 , the line flux derived from the uncorrected spectrum is @xmath39 higher than that from the matched spectrum . ) .",

    "( 2010 ) suggest that warm gas in early - type galaxies are generally powered by evolved stellar sources , especially post agb stars , based on their calculation that an old stellar population is able to provide sufficient ionizing photons for the observed warm gas , as well as the fact that surface brightness of h@xmath17 emission is tightly correlated with that of local optical continuum emission . the latter phenomenon was previously pointed out by ( macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ) . in sarzi",
    "et al . ( 2010 ) , the results have revealed the unusual ionization structure of ngc 4278 . however , the dominant ionization source in ngc 4278 could still be photoionization by uv radiation from old stars instead of fast shock , based on the fact that high ionization regions are characterized by low surface brightness of h@xmath17 emissions , which contradicts with common case for shock - heated region .",
    "they also argued that the shock velocity predicted by shock models ( @xmath40 , depending on whether to introduce a hii precursor ) is too large to maintain a stable rotational pattern as seen in ngc 4278 .",
    "nevertheless , dynamical environment giving birth to hundred - to - thousand pc scale shock is not unexpected for the center of ngc 4278 . as shown by sarzi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the kinematic of ionized gas is different from that of stars , with its position angel of rotation axis showing a maximum deviation from that of the stars at the outmost region , while this misalignment angle between stars and gas gradually decreases toward the inner region and reach a minimum at the galaxy center .",
    "this kinematic feature is not difficult to understand .",
    "morganti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) point out that the central rotational structure of warm gas in ngc 4278 seems to be just a sub component of the large extended hi disk .",
    "it is commonly recognized that massive cold gas disk in elliptical galaxies is usually a product of merging with a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the faint tail - like features in hi map of ngc 4278 also support this idea .",
    "therefore , shock triggered by random collisions between gas clouds could possibly happen when gas is accreted from the extended hi disk to the central stellar gravitational well .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that , the western high ionization region shown in figure 3 exactly corresponds to area in velocity map where gas experience turning of position angle ( sarzi et al .",

    "our observational results reveal several possible signs for a shock process happening in the central region of ngc 4278 .",
    "as discussed above , the extended strong emission of [ siii ] could explained by sputtering destruction of silicate dust grain in the fast shock process instead of x - ray photoionization by central agn , this is further supported by possibly modified size distribution of pahs , as implied by different pah band ratios .",
    "recently , kaneda et al . ( 2010 ) show that in ngc 4589 , another pah - detected ellipticals sharing similar infrared spectral features with ngc 4278 , the pah17 distribution is different from that of pah11.3 emission .",
    "the authors explain this segragation as that pah11.3 arises from newly formed pahs when dusty gas falling toward the center . in figure 5",

    "there is no evidence of dynamical perturbation directly related with the central agn . while being classified as a fr i radio galaxy , the radio jet of ngc 4278 is confined to milli - arcsec scale and shows a direction approximately perpendicular to the elongated main feature of warm gas ( falcke et al .",

    "2009 ) develop a common scenario to interpret the dominance of warm h@xmath0 emissions in dynamically disturbed regions , in which pre - shock gas exists in both high density clouds and low - density intercloud gas . under a higher shock velocity , the low - density",
    ", diffuse gas is heated to plasma with temperature a few @xmath44 , while the dusty clouds heated to lower than @xmath45 cool efficiently , dissipate their kinematic turbulent energy into h@xmath30 emission through slow - shock .",

    "1984 ; ho et al . 1997 ; walsh et al . 2008 ) , these observations are usually based on slit centered at the central agn .",
    "we notice that due to detectable high excitation line [ oiii]@xmath46 in its optical slit spectrum , ngc 4278 were suggested as an possible example of shock - excited liners ( rose et al .",
    "an obstacle to view shock - heating as a main ionization mechanism is the low surface brightness of high ionization area .",
    "interestingly , we find a discrepancy between fine - structure lines with different ionization potentials , with the highest ionization mapped line , [ neiii]@xmath26 , showing the most symmetrical distribution .",
    "a much lower [ neiii]/[neii ] is expected to be produced in shock region than in gas ionized by fuv radiation ( spinoglio & malkan , 1992 ; allen et al .",
    "2008 ) , if this feature is further confirmed , it implies that shock - heating may play a role in excitation of lower ionized species in extended region .",
    "we performed the spitzer irs spectral mapping observations toward the central region of the nearby elliptical galaxy , ngc 4278 .",
    "we discovered rich emission features produced by warm dust , molecular hydrogen and ionized gas in the galaxy center .",
    "the multi - phases of warm and hot gas generally coincide well with optical line distribution , suggesting they belong to a same structure .",
    "we confirm the reverse distribution of ionization states shown in optical observations .",
    "the spectrum of nuclear region is characterized by strong [ siii]@xmath27 emission , which is naturally explained by reduced silicon depletion through dust sputtering .",
    "the pah band ratios in the nuclear region could be interpreted by modified size destruction under selective destruction , especially , the pah @xmath47 ratio , decreases while moving away from the nuclei , indicating a high fraction of neutral pahs or a deficiency of small pahs in the outer region .",
    "the warm molecular hydrogen shows excessive emissions arising from pure rotational transitions with respect to both dust and ionized emission lines , excitation diagram of pure rotational lines gives high excitation temperature similar to some galactic shock - heated regions .",
    "we found a high ionization extended region associated with enhanced rotational molecular emission . we conclude that a hundred - to - thousand pc scale shock region triggered by interaction between clouds and diffuse cold gas accreted from the outer region of the galaxy should exist under the dynamically perturbed environment in the center of ngc 4278 , while the contribution of this shock component to the total ionization of gas is still unclear .",
