    "the many body problem still being to a great deal an unsolved problem , new vistas are welcome .",
    "we here present an extension of self - consistent rpa @xcite which is based on a fermionic many body wave function being the vacuum to an extended rpa destruction operator .",
    "let us expose the main ideas before entering the details of the theory and making an application to a model case . in this work we will consider interacting fermions , however , the extension to the bosonic case is possible .",
    "many - body theories have a clear cut hirarchy : one body , two body , ... , etc .",
    "one body theories are mean field theories .",
    "one can write down a variational wave function for the ground state @xmath0 where @xmath1 are variational parameters and @xmath2 is an arbitrary slater determinant built from an antisymmetric product of @xmath3 fermion creators in the lowest levels , the so - called hole ( h ) levels below the fermi energy .",
    "one can explicitly evaluate the expectation value of , e.g. a two body hamiltonian @xmath4=\\frac{\\langle z^{(1)}|h|z^{(1)}\\rangle } { \\langle z^{(1)}|z^{(1)}\\rangle }   \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] and minimise with respect to the parameters @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the well known hartree - fock ( hf ) equations . that this program can be pulled through hinges to a large extent on the fact that @xmath5 is the vacuum of quasiparticle operators @xmath6 and similiar for @xmath7 , with @xmath8",
    "the scheme clearly is of the raleigh - ritz ( rr ) form stating that the so obtained energy is an upper bound to the true ground state energy .",
    "unfortunately , on the next level , i.e. the two body correlations , there does not exist such a nice closed formalism with rr character . as a consequence",
    "several approaches to two body and higher order correlation functions have been elaborated .",
    "some try to be rr variational , some not . for example",
    ", the so - called hypernetted chain or jastrow approach puts a local , usually translational invariant , two body operator in the exponent , with @xmath9 the corresponding variational parameters .",
    "this leads to a chain of equations , the solution of which may eventually converge to the exact rr variational solution of the corresponding energy , depending on at which level the chain is broken off @xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz @xcite is taylored to the electron gas on a lattice and puts another two body operator in the exponent penalising double occupancies",
    ". however , the variation usually can not be pulled through exactly .",
    "most of the time one is satisfied with the approximate solution given by the so - called gutzwiller equations @xcite .",
    "coupled cluster theory ( cct ) is an approach @xcite starting also with a two body operator in the exponent ( plus eventually higher order operators ) but does not lead to a rr scheme , at least not in its original form .",
    "other non rr schemes are based on the bbgky hirarchy of time dependent density matrices ( tddm ) . on this subject , there have been some interesting developments , recently @xcite . in the past",
    ", several authors , including ourselves , tried to improve rpa as much as possible to overcome certain deficiencies for the calculation of two body correlation functions .",
    "it is , e.g. , well known that standard rpa ( s - rpa ) yields two body correlations functions which violate the pauli principle due to the so - called quasi - boson approximation inherent to s - rpa ( we define s - rpa as being the small amplitude limit of tdhf implying that the exchange term is included ) . usually this leads to a quite strong overbinding of the ground state energy whereas excitation energies may be more correct .",
    "we here will formulate the rpa as a diagonalisation problem as is most appropriate for finite fermi systems , since a good part of the spectrum consists of discrete levels . in this way one usually writes the rpa excitation operator as @xcite @xmath10 with @xmath11 the ( particle , hole ) levels .",
    "the excited state is then written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ground state so that it is the vacuum to the destructors @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 since this scheme can not be pulled through in general , in s - rpa the so - called quasi boson approximation is introduced replacing the fermion pair operators by ideal bose operators @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17=\\delta _",
    "{ pp^{\\prime } } \\delta _ { hh^{\\prime } } \\mbox{. } \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] in this way , ( [ eq3 ] ) boils down to a bogoliubov transformation among ideal bosons with the usual hfb vacuum @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 . since a fermion hamiltonian",
    "can be expanded via holstein - primakoff or belyaev - zelevinsky boson expansion in powers of the boson operators @xcite , the rpa ends up with a standard hfb approach for interacting bosons .",
    "the scheme approaches , of course , a rr variational procedure only in as much as the boson expansion of the hamiltonian converges . in the past",
    ", we used the rpa operator ( [ eq3 ] ) with the fermion pair operators , supposing that the killing condition @xmath20 existed .",
    "however , a corresponding vacuum can only be constructed in some very simplified model cases ( see , e.g. @xcite ) and , thus , in general , the hypothesis of the existence of a vacuum remained an approximation what perturbed the internal consistency of the so - called self consistent rpa ( scrpa ) approach @xcite . in this work",
    "we will adopt the strategy to keep in ( [ eq8 ] ) instead of the boson operators the original fermion pair operators .",
    "we then will see that this ground state still is vacuum to a generalised rpa operator containing the standard operator ( [ eq3 ] ) plus , in addition , specific two body operators correcting for the pauli principle .",
    "with that rpa operator we will set up the familiar equation of motion ( eom ) method @xcite",
    ". the problem will be to evaluate the expectation values of the commutators , since the new rpa operator is non linear , i.e. not of the form of a canonical transformation .",
    "therefore , an effective systematic expansion scheme will be set up for these expectation values .",
    "the procedure will be applied to the very schematic two level lipkin model where it is shown that the expansion converges fast , even for very small particle numbers .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we will consider the following variational ansatz for the many body ground state @xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the variational parameters .",
    "in general they can be complex . in principle",
    "we can add a one body operator as in ( [ eq1 ] ) to the exponent and vary @xmath24 and @xmath25 simultaneously . in order to keep the formalism as transparent as possible",
    ", we will refrain from this complication here and suppose that we work in the standard hf basis .",
    "the first task will be to find an rpa operator @xmath26 which applied to @xmath27 gives the excited states of the system : @xmath28 and whose hermitian conjugate kills the ground state acting , therefore , as a vacuum @xmath29 we make the following ansatz for the destruction operator@xcite @xmath30   \\nonumber \\\\",

    ". the amplitudes @xmath34 can be normalised according to @xmath35|0\\rangle = 1 $ ] .",
    "evidently ( [ eq12 ] ) contains the usual rpa operator ( [ eq3 ] ) plus extra specific 2-body operators .",
    "these extra terms serve to fullfil the pauli principle .",
    "they make , however , the calculus rather heavy . in the following ,",
    "we shortly outline our approach and then give an application to a schematic model . in order to determine the amplitudes @xmath34",
    ", we proceed as usual and minimisethe following mean excitation energy , equivalent to the minimisation of an ( symmetrised ) energy weighted sum rule @xcite , @xmath36|0\\rangle + \\langle 0|[[q_{\\nu } , h],q_{\\nu } ^{+}]|0\\rangle } { 2\\langle 0|[q_{\\nu } , q_{\\nu}^{+}]|0\\rangle } \\mbox{. }   \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] using in this expression the standard rpa operator @xmath37 , we obtain from the minimisation of ( [ eq16 ] ) with respect to the amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 the usual structure of the ( self consistent ) rpa equations .",
    "however , with ( [ eq8 ] ) the rpa equations become more complicated . among other things , this stems from the fact that the norm matrix is now non diagonal , i.e. the structure of the equations is as follows @xmath40 with obvious definitions of the matrices @xmath41 and @xmath3 .",
    "they are hermitian matrices by construction , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in order to arrive at the usual structure ,",
    "we write @xmath44 with @xmath45 and obtain in short hand notation @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this equation now has globally the same mathematical structure as standard rpa or scrpa ( details are different , of course ) .",
    "in particular , we have for the normalisation @xmath49 .",
    "of course , the task is not finished .",
    "the difficulty resides in how to express the correlation functions in @xmath50 and @xmath51 by the amplitudes @xmath52 , since the form ( [ eq12 ] ) of the rpa operator , as already mentioned , does not constitute a canonical transformation among operators and can , therefore , not be inverted in a straightforward manner .",
    "we will set up an expansion scheme which can be paraphrased as follows : suppose we did not know how to invert the bogoliubov transformation from ordinary to quasiparticles in standard bcs theory .",
    "how to calculate expectation values in the bcs state nontheless ?",
    "among other ways , this can go as follows .",
    "as is well known , the bcs state can be written as a coherent state : @xmath53|vac\\rangle $ ] .",
    "we want to calculate , e.g. the pairing tensor @xmath54 .",
    "we have @xmath55 . multiplying this relation with @xmath56 and repeating the operation leads to the well known bcs expression @xmath57 where we supposed for simplicity @xmath58 to be real",
    ", i.e. @xmath59 , and used @xmath60 with @xmath61 . using an analogous method to calculate the correlation functions in the rpa matrix leads to a series which , unfortunately , does not break off after a low number of terms unless one deals with very few particle states . as the example with the bcs state shows however , the series contains nontrivial terms and may , thus , converge rapidly .",
    "if convergence is achieved , pauli principle is respected fully , since the theory is based on a wave function .",
    "of course , the final success will depend on that supposed rate of convergence .",
    "this ends the rough outline of the theory .",
    "let us now make an application to the lipkin model which often has served in the past as a testing ground for many body theories .",
    "we will see how in that model the series expansion works and that in this case the convergence of the series is , indeed , fast and performant .",

    "this is given below in ( [ eq38a ] ) .",
    "with @xmath106 one then obtains @xmath107 it can readily be checked that this solution coincides with the exact one . please notice that the equality @xmath108 only holds at the solution ( [ eq37b ] ) .",
    "therefore , only after convergence to the solution we obtain the usual rpa structure with eigenvalues which come in pairs @xmath109 .",
    "this also holds for the other cases with @xmath110 considered below .",
    "we surmise that this is a general property of our theory .",

    "we see that scrpa with @xmath119 ( scrpa(@xmath120 ) ) systematically and substantially improves over the @xmath121 case ( scrpa(0 ) ) in the range @xmath122 .",
    "this fact shows that the extra correlations introduced in the excitation operator ( [ eq12 ] ) improving the pauli principle play an important role . in the range @xmath123 ,",
    "ground and excited states become strongly mixed and scrpa in the spherical basis deviates more and more from the exact solution .",
    "the good agreement of scrpa@xmath124 with the exact solution also demonstrates that the convergence of our expansion scheme is fast . in future work",
    "it will be very interesting to apply our theory also to the symmetry broken regime .",
    "in this work we have set up a self - consistent rpa ( scrpa ) theory which is based on a fermionic many body vacuum .",
    "that is , we constructed a killing operator of the correlated vacuum @xmath125|hf\\rangle$ ] , with @xmath126 a two body operator , see eq ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) which also is the starting point of coupled cluster theory @xcite .",
    "this killing operator consists of the usual @xmath127 rpa operator with , additionally , specific two body terms correcting for the pauli principle . with this extended rpa operator , we develope the standard equation of motion technique and arrive at scrpa equations of the usual mathematical structure . since the extended rpa operator is not of the type of a canonical transformation between operators , the evaluation of the correlation functions contained in the rpa matrix in terms of the rpa amplitudes is not evident .",
    "we proposed a systematic expansion scheme in terms of higher and higher correlations functions ( there may be room for improving this scheme ) and applied it to the two level lipkin model as a testing ground .",
    "it is found that the additional terms in the rpa operator systematically and substantially improve the results .",
    "we want to stress that once convergence is achieved with the mentioned expansion , the pauli principle is fully respected , since our method is based on a fermionic many body ground state which is the vacuum to an ( extended ) rpa operator . in this way",
    "scrpa which in the past suffered from the fact that it was based on a non existing vacuum is now put on grounds with more internal consistency .",
    "however , the practical success will depend on the convergence rate of our expansion scheme in more realistic situations .",
    "this is similar to the convergence rate of the hirarchy of hypernetted chain equations with jastrow theory . in this work we only investigated the symmetry unbroken phase of the lipkin model .",
    "the symmetry broken phase as well as other models for strongly interacting fermions shall be investigated in the future . on the formal level",
    "some questions still need to be considered also .",
    "the most important one is whether the goldstone theorem when working in a symmetry broken phase still holds as in s - rpa .",
    "in particular this concerns the fullfillment of conservation laws , the appearence of a zero mode and the respect of ward identities .",
