    "with the announcement of the 2008 nobel prize in physics , there has been a lot of excitement among the community working on cp violation ( cpv ) . in 1972 ,",
    "kobayashi and maskawa had proposed that cpv could be incorporated as a single phase in the three generation quark mixing matrix . with only three quarks",
    "@xmath0 known at that time , it had been a bold step .",
    "cpv had been discovered in 1964 , as a tiny effect in the decays of @xmath1 mesons by cronin and fitch .",
    "cpv has an important role to play in the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it is believed that the universe was born with equal amounts of matter and antimatter , but since we only see matter around us , it implies that matter and antimatter behave differently . in 1967 , sakharov gave the famous three conditions for generating a baryon number asymmetry in the universe :    * baryon number violation , to allow the antibaryons to disappear while baryons survive . *",
    "cpv , since the decay rates of baryons and antibaryons must differ .",
    "* departure from thermal equilibrium , to ensure that the created asymmetry is not washed away .",
    "ten years after sakharov laid down the above stated conditions , the bound state of the @xmath2 quark , the upsilon was observed . in 1984 ,",
    "bigi and sanda showed that in the kobayashi and maskawa ( km ) picture , the cp violating effects would be observable in the @xmath3 system if , the @xmath3 has a long lifetime and if , the neutral @xmath3 mixing is large . in 1987 ,",
    "large @xmath4 mixing was indeed observed by argus at desy . in 1999 , the b factories started operation with the detectors , babar at slac and belle at kek . in the same year , direct cpv was clearly confirmed in kaon decays .",
    "the year 2001 saw the observation of large cpv using the golden mode @xmath5 at both belle and babar .",
    "this provided the first and unambiguous verification of the complex phase in the km proposal . in the years that followed",
    ", results from belle and babar provided additional supporting evidence for the km scheme .",
    "in the standard model(sm ) , cpv arises from the complex yukawa couplings .",
    "the yukawa interactions generate the mass terms .",
    "the product of unitary matrices that diagonalize the mass matrices is the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix and it relates the weak eigenstates to the mass eigenstates , @xmath6 [ eq : ckm ]  the elements of the ckm matrix describe the charged current couplings .",
    "the matrix has to be unitary by construction .",
    "the orthonormality relation obtained by using the first and third columns of @xmath7 is a simple complex relation , @xmath8 , which can be geometrically represented by a triangle on a plane and is referred to as the unitarity triangle .",
    "this triangle is of relevance in @xmath3 decays and all its sides are of the same order , resulting in large interior angles @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , defined as , @xmath12 the ckm has a hierarchical structure , in the wolfenstein representation it has the form would have been sufficient , but with increasing experimental precision and moreover since new physics effects are expected to be tiny , we write the elements upto @xmath13 . ] @xmath14 & 1-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2}-\\frac{\\lambda^4}{8}(1 + 4a^2 ) & a\\lambda^2 \\\\              a\\lambda^3[1-(1-\\frac{\\lambda^2}{2})(\\rho+i\\eta ) ] &              -a\\lambda^2+\\frac{a\\lambda^4}{2}[1 - 2(\\rho+i\\eta ) ]   &              1-\\frac{a^2\\lambda^4}{2}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) +          \\cal{o}(\\lambda^{\\rm{6}})\\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] nonzero values of the phases ( @xmath15 ) imply cpv .",
    "a huge effort has been made at the @xmath3 factories and now also at the tevatron to measure the weak phases .",
    "the km mechanism for cpv is unique and predictive . moreover",
    ", the cp phases can be measured through certain asymmetries which are free of hadronic uncertainties . any inconsistencies",
    "if noted , would indicate physics beyond the sm or new physics ( np ) . since the baryon number density predicted by the km mechanism is many orders of magnitude below the observed value , we need new sources of cpv",
    ". correlations among the many cpv observables in meson decays can possibly pinpoint the kind of np or at least constrain its parameters .",
    "phases can be observed only through interference terms in modes to which two ( or more ) different amplitudes with distinct phases contribute .",
    "the different ways in which the interference terms appear , result in the following categories of cpv :    1 .",
    "cpv in mixing : if the mass eigenstates differ from the cp eigenstates , it leads to a relative phase between the dispersive and absorptive parts of the transition amplitude from the neutral meson , @xmath16 to its conjugate @xmath17 . for the neutral @xmath3",
    "it can be observed by measuring the semileptonic asymmetry , @xmath18 which will be nonzero if @xmath19 .",
    "current measurements imply that @xmath20 is compatible with zero . in the k system ,",
    "cpv in mixing had been seen , @xmath21 the measured value  @xcite is a weighted average of muon and electron measurements . 2 .",
    "cpv in decay ( direct ) : for a decay amplitude with two weak contributions , the amplitude and its conjugate have the form and @xmath22 are the weak and strong phases respectively . ] , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the cp asymmetry is hence given by , @xmath25 the asymmetry is non vanishing if @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "direct cpv was clearly established in @xmath1 decays with the accurate measurement of @xmath28 in the year 1999 . in many b decay modes",
    "it has been measured to be significantly different from zero  @xcite .",
    "3 .   cpv due to interference between decays with and without mixing : final states f into which both @xmath16 and @xmath17 can decay , have two interfering paths provided by the direct decay of @xmath29 and that of @xmath30 .",
    "the time dependent decay rate of @xmath31 thus has the form , @xmath32~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while that for @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays is more complex , due to the width difference @xmath35 . in the golden mode @xmath36 ,",
    "the decay amplitude is dominated by only one tree amplitude with a real ckm element , implying that @xmath37 , the time dependent cp asymmetry has the simple form , @xmath38 and is almost completely free of hadronic uncertainties ( measures @xmath10 cleanly up to @xmath39 ) .",
    "time dependent cp asymmetery has been measured in many other @xmath3 decay modes , @xmath40 , @xmath41 etc .",
    "plane using cp violating(left ) and cp conserving(right ) observables.,title=\"fig : \" ]   plane using cp violating(left ) and cp conserving(right ) observables.,title=\"fig : \" ]    0.4 cm     plane using cp violating(left ) and cp conserving(right ) observables . ]",
    "current data from @xmath1 and @xmath3 decays have been used by the utfit collaboration  @xcite and the ckmfitter group  @xcite to perform a global fit in the @xmath42 plane , depicting the allowed region for the apex of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the resulting plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : global ] and clearly show that all observations are consistent with each other .",
    "[ fig : cp ] shows the contributions from cp conserving and cp violating observables , again these are not only individually consistent but also with each other .",
    "current observations hence imply that :    * @xmath43 is non vanishing , implying that the km mechanism is working .",
    "* there is consistency of results from k mesons and b mesons .",
    "* almost all cp violating observables ( tree level and loop level ) as well as measurements of rare decays and mixing parameters , are consistent with the km mechanism .",
    "the ckm picture of sm seems to have been successful !",
    "* ckm mechanism is the dominant mechanism for cp violation and flavor mixing . * but , there is room for new physics .",
    "1 .   the @xmath44 puzzle : the cp asymmetry for @xmath45 and for @xmath46",
    "is expected to be the same from isospin . however , the measured asymmetries  @xcite for these modes are : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the difference in these asymmetries , @xmath49 , is non vanishing at @xmath50 .",
    "note that the @xmath51 mode gets contributions from penguin and tree diagrams , while the @xmath46 mode can have additional colour suppressed and electroweak penguin contributions ( ignoring smaller contributions ) .",
    "there have been attempts to explain the discrepancy , through np using fourth generation  @xcite .",
    "more recently  @xcite , it has been indicated that the theory calculations are consistent , if sizable @xmath52 corrections are taken into account .",
    "since , hadronic uncertainties are involved , predictions for cp violating asymmetries have large errors , so a firm conclusion can not yet be made .",
    "2 .   new physics in @xmath53 : for a final state @xmath54 , the deviation of the time dependent cp asymmetry for @xmath54 from that of @xmath55 mode , @xmath56 is expected to be zero .",
    "while many modes are now consistent with this expectation , there are slight deviations in some modes .",
    "while theory predictions are for small and positive deviations , experimental results yield negative deviations in some modes  @xcite .",
    "np scenarios have been proposed to explain this discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "although the effects now seem to be tiny , with small np effects expected , we need to wait for improved statistical significance .",
    "in addition , there is a discrepancy in @xmath57 versus @xmath10 measured from tree level measurements alone  @xcite .",
    "3 .   @xmath58 measurement at the tevatron : cdf and d0 have performed a time dependent analysis of @xmath59 , to get a correlated measurement of ( @xmath58 , @xmath60 ) . the utfit combination of the tevatron data gives a @xmath61 deviation  @xcite of @xmath62 from sm .",
    "in the standard model , there is no guiding flavour principle .",
    "the pattern of masses and mixing parameters is unexplained .",
    "it is unclear why there should be only three generations .",
    "the current baryon number density , @xmath63 , reflects the baryon asymmetry induced by baryogenesis .",
    "new sources of cpv are required to generate this observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "apart from these questions in the flavour sector , there are many other reasons which lead us to believe that the sm is a low energy effective theory of some fundamental theory .",
    "in particular , quadratic divergence in the sm higgs mass , requires np at around the tev scale .",
    "hence , we can extend the sm lagrangian by higher dimension operators , suppressed by powers of the np scale .",
    "most rare decay modes are flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes that appear only at the loop level and are hence useful for np searches . for example , consider the @xmath64 processes of mixing involving the down type quark ( d ) . in the sm , the lagrangian has the form , @xmath65 ^ 2 $ ] , where , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the scale for loop suppressed sm processes . assuming that the np effective operator has the same dirac structure as in the sm , we have @xmath68 ^ 2 $ ] with coefficient , @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the order of the mass of the np particle .",
    "the various measurements ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) of the @xmath64 processes , imply that the np scale must be above @xmath76 tev , much larger than the weak scale .",
    "thus , np with generic flavour violation structure is excluded at the tev scale .",
    "this is the new physics flavour puzzle  @xcite .",
    "it can be resolved by having minimal flavour violation(mfv ) .",
    "if the scale of np has to be of tev order , we need some principle to make the coefficients of fcnc s small . in the sm , the global flavor symmetry group ,",
    "@xmath77 is broken only by yukawa couplings @xmath78 and @xmath79 . in the mfv hypothesis",
    ", there is a unique source of breaking of @xmath80 , operators that break @xmath80 , must transform just as the yukawa terms .",
    "it was formalized by dambrosio et al  @xcite , who suggested that the yukawa couplings be promoted to spurions that transform under @xmath80 as , @xmath81 ( for the quark sector ) .",
    "mfv np is also formally invariant under @xmath80 , breaking coming only from insertions of spurion fields @xmath82 . integrating out heavy fields ( np fields , higgs , top , w and z ) leads to a low energy effective field theory invariant under @xmath80 . using the basis",
    "in which @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are diagonal matrices proportional to quark masses and @xmath87 is the ckm matrix , insertions of @xmath88 will be of the order @xmath89 , making this theory very predictive .",
    "in addition , if one imposes the constraint that the structure of low energy operators be the same as in sm and only the wilson coefficients of weak operators deviate from sm values , one gets the constrained mfv .",
    "this is clearly experimentally distinguishable , due to correlations between observables .",
    "in order to find np , we need to make even more precise measurements of the cp violating phases .",
    "measurement of rare decays : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 etc . , have played an important role in constraining np models and further precision measurements could pinpoint to np ( mfv or nonmfv ) or at least narrow down the parameter space of various np models . as an example , apart from the forward backward asymmetry being currently measured in @xmath92  @xcite , a detailed angular analysis of this mode can be used to determine various other asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "some of these asymmetries are cp violating and are expected to be negligible in the sm , a measured value would imply np . in the @xmath34 system , within",
    "the sm cpv is negligible and an observation of cpv would be a clear signal of np  @xcite . a technique to accurately determine all the mixing parameters , including the cp violating phase has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . with higher statistics possible at lhcb and super b factories , all such searches for",
    "np should be feasible !",
    "the kobayashi maskawa mechanism of cp violation has been well tested with the results from the b factories . however , to explain the baryon asymmetry",
    ", we expect new sources of cp violation .",
    "search for new physics , requires precision measurements of the cp violating parameters . in conjunction with rare b and k decays",
    ", it could point to the kind of new physics present : susy , extra dimensions , little higgs @xmath97 .",
