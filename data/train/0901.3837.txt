    "<S> electroweak chiral lagrangian for a hypercharge - universal topcolor model is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the assignments of universal hypercharge improve the results obtained previously from k.lanes prototype natural tc2 model by allowing a larger @xmath0 mass resulting in a very small t parameter and the s parameter is still around the order of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 12.60.nz ; 11.10.lm , 11.30.rd , 12.10.dm    topcolor - assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) is a class of new physics models which combines technicolor and topcolor together to realize the electroweak symmetry breaking dynamically . in these theories , </S>",
    "<S> a technicolor condensate provides the masses to the weak vector bosons and an extended technicolor ( etc ) sector gives masses to the light quarks and leptons , and a bottom - quark - sized mass to the top . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of the top - quark mass is due to the formation of a top - quark condensate through the dynamics of an extended color gauge sector . </S>",
    "<S> the typical gauge group of the tc2 models is @xmath2 , in which the extended color and hypercharge groups @xmath3 spontaneously break to their diagonal subgroup @xmath4 at a few tevs and the remaining electroweak groups @xmath5 spontaneously break to their electromagnetic subgroup @xmath6 at the electroweak scale due to a combination of a top - quark condensate and a technifermion condensate . in the original tc2 model @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the extended hyper - charge sector @xmath7 is usually arranged nonuniversal in flavor to ensure that the bottom - quark and other light quarks and leptons do not condensate . </S>",
    "<S> recently a new type of tc2 model with a flavor - universal extended hyper - charge sector is proposed in ref.@xcite , the authors there have examined various experimental and theoretical constraints , finding that precision electroweak measurements yield the strongest bounds on the model and the goodness of fit to all available z - pole and lep2 data for hypercharge - universal topcolor is comparable to that of the standard model ( sm ) . in contrast , tc2 models with a flavor nonuniversal hypercharge sector are markedly disfavored by the data . the similar result on the nonuniversal hypercharge tc2 models </S>",
    "<S> is also obtained from our works @xcite , where we have computed the coefficients of the bosonic part of electroweak chiral lagrangian ( ewcl ) up to the order @xmath8 and found an upper bound for the mass of flavor nonuniversal @xmath0 boson . for hill s schematic tc2 model @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 mass @xmath9 is a few tevs and the s parameter can be either positive or negative depending on whether the @xmath9 is large or small @xcite . while for k.lanes prototype natural tc2 model @xcite , @xmath9 must be smaller than 400gev and the s parameter is around order of @xmath1 @xcite . since ref.@xcite already shows explicitly the experiment fit of the tc2 model due to the changes from the nonuniversal to the universal assignments for hypercharge sector , it is worthwhile to apply our formulation developed in ref.@xcite to the flavor - universal hypercharge topcolor model proposed in ref.@xcite to examine the improvements from an alternative point of view . </S>",
    "<S> our formulation offers an upper bound on nonuniversal @xmath0 mass previously , while ref.@xcite gives a lower bound of universal @xmath0 mass of roughly 2tev . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that applying our formulation to flavor - universal hypercharge topcolor model produces an upper bound on universal @xmath0 mass which will compensate the lower bound for the mass of universal @xmath0 boson obtained from ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , from ewcl point of view , except technicolor and @xmath0 contributions , there are many other different sources to influence ewcl coefficients . in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have made efforts to investigate the effective four - fermion interactions induced by extended technicolor ( etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that their effects are small and we further point out that the walking technicolor ( wtc ) effects are worth future investigation . considering that the authors in ref.@xcite assume that wtc effects do not generate large precision electroweak corrections , up to present stage , we ignore wtc effects in this work .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we are mainly interested in the effects from flavor - universal hypercharge sector , to reduce the computations and to be convenient for comparison with flavor - nonuniversal hypercharge model , we base our calculations on the k.lanes prototype natural tc2 model @xcite discussed in ref.@xcite , but change its hypercharge assignments to that given in ref.@xcite . </S>",
