    "luminous soft x - ray radiation of accreting stellar - mass black holes ( bhs ) has generally been explained as thermal emission from optically - thick ( in particular `` standard '' ) accretion disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; @xcite ) , which are expected to form around them under rather high accretion rates .",
    "in contrast , their hard x - ray production process is much less understood , even though intense hard x - ray emission characterizes black - hoe binaries ( bhbs ) among various types of compact x - ray sources in the milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "indeed , bhbs often emit a major fraction of their radiative luminosity in the hard x - ray band , in the form of spectral hard - tail component if they are in so - called high / soft state , or as the entire power - law ( hereafter pl ) like continua if they are in so - called low / hard state ( hereafter lhs ) which appears under relatively low accretion rates .",
    "furthermore , the hard x - ray emission ( particularly in the lhs ) involves another interesting aspect , namely the long - known aperiodic variation over a wide frequency range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these spectral and timing studies are not limited to stellar - mass bhs , since a fair fraction of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are also considered to be in a state analogous to the lhs of bhbs , emitting luminous hard x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in hard x - rays , a bhb in the lhs emits a roughly pl shaped continuum with a photon index @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the spectrum gradually steepens toward higher energies .",
    "this has been explained in terms of unsaturated comptonization of some soft seed photons , in a cloud of hot maxwellian electrons , or a  corona \" , with a temperature of @xmath8 kev and an optical depth of @xmath9 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the comtpon @xmath10-parameter , @xmath11 , also take a value of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath14 is the electron mass and @xmath15 is the light velocity .",
    "the electrons will be cooled by transferring their energies to the photons , while heated via coulombic collisions by ions that acquire nearly a free - fall temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the comptonizing cloud may be identified with radiatively inefficient inner accretion flow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "superposed on the dominant continuum characterizing the lhs , we often observe a spectral hump at energies of 2040 kev due to `` reflection '' of the primary x - rays by some cool materials ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a fluorescent fe - k emission line ( @xcite ) , and an apparently `` smeared '' fe - k edge ( @xcite ) .",
    "these features can be explained by assuming that a fraction of the primary hard x - rays are reprocessed by cool materials located near the bh , presumably an optically - thick part of the accretion disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "this part of the disk may at the same time produce an x - ray excess which we often observe at the softest end of the spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and furthermore , may provide the comptonizing corona with the seed photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in spite of general success of this currently popular interpretation of the lhs in terms of comptonizing hot clouds and cool materials , details of the scenario still need to be elucidated .",
    "it is yet to be confirmed that the seed photons are provided by a cool accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , rather than by thermal cyclotron emission in the compton corona itself ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry and size of the comptonizing cloud is not well known , except for loose constraints , including ; that the cloud should be large enough for the compactness parameter to remain within a reasonable range ( @xcite ) , but should not be too large to be able to produce the hard x - ray variation on a @xmath12 s time scale , and that it should have a sufficient vertical height so as to efficiently illuminate the reprocessing matter . still unsettled is the relation between the hot corona and the putative cool disk ; whether the cool disk is truncated at a large radius @xcite , or it penetrates deep into the hot corona @xcite . yet another fundamental issue is how to understand the violent hard x - ray variability in the context of thermal comptonization scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to address these issues associated with the lhs of accreting bhs , a number of spectral studies have been conducted so far , by fitting observed broad - band spectra with theoretical spectral models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , extensive studies in the frequency domain have been conducted to characterize the random variations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the former approach is limited in that different modelings often degenerate .",
    "the latter approach has also a limitation , in that it may not constrain details of the comptonization scenario without invoking particular models @xcite .",
    "we analyze broad - band ( 0.7400 kev ) suzaku data of cygnus x-1 ( cyg x-1 ; oda 1977 ; lian and nolan 1984 ) acquired in 2005 october . with the wide - band sensitivity",
    ", suzaku is expected to provide novel diagnostics of this bhb , the first celestial object suspected to be a black hole @xcite . to overcome the above difficulties",
    ", we compare the suzaku spectra of cyg x-1 with those of gro  1655@xmath640 , searching the two spectra for differences attributable to their different system inclination , @xmath16 of cyg x-1 ( @xcite ) and @xmath17 of gro  1655@xmath640 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we hence refer to the suzaku results on gro  1655@xmath640 by @xcite as paper i. we also analyze spectral changes associated with the random variations on a time scale of @xmath12 s ( section  [ sec : ana_varspec ] ) , to see how the compton parameters are changing ; this will be complementary to the study of long - term spectral changes ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we employ a distance of 2.5 kpc @xcite to cyg x-1 .",
    "the errors refer to statistical 90% confidence limits .",
    "the present suzaku observation of cyg x-1 was performed on 2005 october 5 , from ut 04:34 through 15:11 for a net exposure of 17.4  ks , as a part of the initial performance verification program of suzaku @xcite .",
    "suzaku carries 4 sets of x - ray telescopes @xcite , each coupled to a focal - plane x - ray ccd camera called xis ( x - ray imaging spectrometer ; @xcite ) operating in the energy range of 0.212  kev .",
    "three ( xis0 , xis2 , and xis3 ) of the four xis sensors use front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , while xis1 utilizes a back - illuminated ( bi ) one thus achieving an improved soft x - ray response .",
    "the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) covers the 1070 kev energy band with si pin photo - diodes ( hxd - pin ) , and the 50600 kev range with gso scintillation counters ( hxd - gso ) .",
    "because the optical axes of the xis and the hxd are slightly ( @xmath18 ) offset , the observation was carried out with the source placed at the center of the xis field of view .",
    "the hxd was operated in the nominal mode throughout the observation .",
    "because the source was very bright , the xis was operated with the `` 1/8 window option '' , in which a smaller field of view of @xmath19 is read out every 1  s. the editing mode of the fi ccds was set to @xmath20 , while that of the bi ccd ( xis1 ) was @xmath21 . in the present observation , however , xis1 with the bi ccd chip suffered severe telemetry saturation , for more than 60% of the total exposure .    during the observation ,",
    "the averaged source count rates ( excluding backgrounds ) of xis0 , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso were @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 c  s@xmath1 , in the energy bands of 0.510  kev , 1070  kev , and 70400  kev , respectively .",
    "however , the true xis0 counts would be higher , if the data were free from telemetry overflows and event pile up ( subsection  [ subsec : xisreduction ] ) .",
    "we retrieved the xis data which were prepared via version 1.2 processing .",
    "the xis data were further screened based on the following standard criteria : the xis grade should be 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 ; the time interval after an exit from the south atlantic anomaly should be longer than 500 s ; and the object should be at least @xmath25 and @xmath26 above the dark and sunlit earth rim , respectively .    in order to conduct spectral and timing studies , we utilize xis events extracted from a region which is defined to fit in the `` 1/8 window '' .",
    "since the suzaku attitude is known to wobble on a time scale of several tens minutes , the region needs to be a little smaller than the window size .",
    "considering the magnitude of the wobbling , we defined the region as an intersection between a rectangle of @xmath27 pixels and a circle with a radius of @xmath28 ( 200 pixels ) , both centered always on the image peak . for this purpose , we calculated the image center every 200  s and re - defined the event extraction region also every 200 s. thus , the location of the region on the ccd chip is time dependent .",
    "the background was entirely negligible throughout the observation ( less than 0.1% of the signal at 8  kev considering the galactic ridge emission ) , so was not subtracted from the data .    because cyg x-1 was so bright that we need to carefully remove the effects of telemetry saturation and photon pile up .",
    "when the number of detected events exceeds the telemetry allocation to the xis , the excess events are discarded without being transferred to telemetry .",
    "this phenomenon is called telemetry saturation .",
    "since the event buffer is cleared every 8  s , and the xis exposure was 1  s in the present observation , we excluded the telemetry - saturated data in the following way .",
    "for each 8-s window , we calculated an average count rate over the first 4 s which are usually free from the telemetry saturation .",
    "if a subsequent exposure in the same 8-s window showed a count rate lower than this average by more than 2 standard deviations , we judged that the telemetry was saturated , and discarded this and the subsequent exposures in the same window .",
    "this typically occurred in the last one or two exposures in the 8-s window . because these telemetry - saturated time bins are regarded as dead times , the source count rate remains approximately intact , although the exposure is reduced .    after filtering out the telemetry - saturated data , we further removed the effects of photon pile up .",
    "although the suzaku x - ray telescopes have relatively wide point spread functions , photon pile up becomes noticeable at the image center when observing a point source brighter than @xmath29 cts per exposure .",
    "the average count rate of cyg x-1 during the present observation was @xmath30 times higher than this limit .",
    "we therefore accumulated xis events by excluding circular regions of various radii at the image center , and examined the obtained series of spectra for shape changes . as a result ,",
    "we have decided to exclude an image - center region with a radius of @xmath31 ( 60 pixels ) .",
    "although this means that the event extraction region has a complicated shape ( intersection of an annulus and a rectangle ) , we use standard ancillary response files ( ` ae_xi0_xisnom4_20060615.arf ` , etc . )",
    "defined for a circular region of @xmath32 radius .",
    "this is because the point spread function of the telescope has little energy dependence , and hence the spectrum would not change except in normalization .",
    "we confirmed this inference using the data of a moderately bright point source , ss cyg observed on 2005 november 2 , and found that the spectral normalization should be multiplied by a factor of @xmath33 compared with that of pin , when excluding the central @xmath34 of the image ; this is taken into account in the subsequent spectral analysis .",
    "we also use the standard response matrices ( ` ae_xi0_20060213.rmf ` , etc . ) for the xis .",
    "the hxd data utilized here were prepared via version 1.2 processing .",
    "we further screened the hxd events by imposing conditions that more than 500 s should be elapsed from an exit out of the south atlantic anomaly , that the target should be @xmath35 above the earth rim , and that the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity should be higher than 8 gv .",
    "since the hxd has neither imaging capability nor an offset counter to measure instantaneous non x - ray background ( nxb ) , we need to estimate the nxb and subtract it from the raw data . accordingly , we employed the pin background modeling by @xcite , known as `` pinudlc ( bgd_a ) '' model , which combines actual hxd - pin data acquired while pointing to night earth @xcite .",
    "thus , we produced a large number ( 10.0 times as large as the actual ) of fake non x - ray background events , which would just be detected during the present observation if we had an imaginary nxb monitor detector . by processing this fake event files exactly in the same manner as the actual data",
    ", we can estimate nxb contributions in the pin data , and subtract them from pin light curves as well as from pin spectra , with a typical accuracy of 5% or better .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background entering through the pin field of view is entirely negligible in the present study .",
    "subtraction of the hxd - gso background employs a different method , developed by @xcite and called `` lcfit ( bgd_d ) '' model . in this case , the whole gso energy band is divided into 32 energy bins , and a light curve of each energy bin is produced over a long period . because each light curve has characteristic repetition patterns with periods of one orbital revolution , one day ( due to the relation with respect to the south atlantic anomaly ) , and 51 days ( due to orbital precession ) , it can be expressed as a function of time using a relatively small number of adjustable parameters .",
    "the parameters can be determined by analyzing these light curves over a long period , typically one month .",
    "we can thus derive the expected nxb counts in individual energy bins at a given time during the present observation , and subtract them either from light curves or spectra .",
    "the gso data are hence analyzed using the same energy binnings as used in the nxb modeling . when integrated over @xmath12 day , this method reproduces the gso background within a systematic error of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "since the pin and gso background models both utilize pin upper - discriminator hit rates , their basic time resolution is typically 4 s or longer , depending on the telemetry rate .",
    "( 9cm,)cygx1_figure1.ps      figure  [ fig : ltcurves ] shows xis2 , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso light curves of cyg x-1 from the present observation .",
    "the hxd backgrounds ( pin and gso ) were subtracted in the way as described in section  [ subsec : hxdreduction ] , and the results were corrected for dead times . in contrast , the xis background , which is completely negligible , is inclusive .",
    "the count rates indicated by these xis light curves are by an order of mangnitude lower than those actually observed , because of the image - center exclusion which was needed to avoid pile - up events ( subsection [ subsec : xisreduction ] ) . on time scales of a few minutes to a day , the source thus varied randomly typically by @xmath37% .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : avspec ] the time - averaged suzaku spectra of cyg x-1 . like in section  [ subsec : obs_ltcurve ] , we corrected the hxd spectra for the dead times , and subtracted the backgrounds using the method described in section  [ subsec : hxdreduction ] .",
    "in contrast , the xis2 spectrum is here and hereafter not corrected for the normalization reduction ( down to 0.092 of the original level ) , due to the exclusion of the central @xmath34 of the images ( subsection [ subsec : xisreduction ] ) . for comparison , we superpose the modeled background spectra of hxd - pin and hxd - gso .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : avspec ] , we have significantly detected cyg x-1 nearly across the full energy band of suzaku . in particular , the source signals in hxd - pin exceed the nxb by more than a factor of @xmath38 , even at the highest energy of @xmath39 kev .",
    "therefore , the systematic background uncertainty of hxd - pin is completely negligible compared to photon counting statistics . even in the gso range ,",
    "the source signal is so strong that it can be detectable up to @xmath40 kev , above which the systematic background errors start dominating .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of time - averaged suzaku spectra of cyg x-1 .",
    "because of the strong telemetry saturation ( section [ subsec : obs ] ) , we do not use the data from xis1 ( bi ) .",
    "of the three fi ccd cameras comprising the xis , only the data from xis2 are employed in our spectral analyses , while those from xis0 and xis3 are utilized in section  [ sec : ana_varspec ] for a different purpose ; even if we incorporated data from the other xis sensors , systematic errors would dominate before data statistics are improved , because cyg x-1 is so bright for the xis .      in order to roughly characterize the time - averaged broad - band spectra derived in subsection  [ subsec : obs_avspec ] , we simultaneously fitted simple empirical models to the xis2 , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso spectra , so that the results may be compared with other observations of cyg x-1 , as well as those of other similar objects . here and hereafter",
    ", the overall model normalization is allowed to differ between the xis and hxd ( mainly to absorb uncertainties introduced by the removal of telemetry saturated data and the image - center exclusion ) , but constrained to be the same between hxd - pin and hxd - gso . as the detector responses , we use ` ae_xi2_20060213.rmf ` and ` ae_xi2_xisnom4_20060615.arf ` for xis2 , ` ae_hxd_pinxinom_20060814.rsp ` for pin , while ` ae_hxd_gsoxinom_20060321.rsp ` and ` ae_hxd_gsoxinom_20070424.arf ` for gso .",
    "the last gso file is the correction factor described in paper  i , introduced so as to make the crab nebula spectrum described by a single pl model with @xmath41 .",
    "we discard the xis data in the 1.71.9 kev range to avoid complexity of the si - k edge modeling , and those in the @xmath42 kev band which is possibly affected still by the photon pile - up effects .",
    "the hxd - pin data below 12 kev are also discarded in the fitting , to avoid response uncertainties there @xcite .",
    "we utilize the hxd - gso data in the 70400 kev energy band , because of the poor signal significance ( figure  [ fig : avspec ] ) and relatively large response uncertainties , in @xmath43 kev and @xmath44 kev , respectively .",
    "we assign a systematic error of 1% to all the spectral bins , in order to absorb uncertainties in the instrumental calibration , including in particular those associated with the detector responses and background estimation .",
    "the effect of contamination on the optical blocking filters of the xis is modeled as additional absorption @xcite .",
    "we also trimmed the energy offset by @xmath45 17 ev , considering the current uncertainty with the xis energy scale in the @xmath20 mode .",
    "as the simplest attempt , we first fitted an absorbed single pl model simultaneously to the three sets of spectra .",
    "the fit indicated @xmath46 as the best estimate , and an absorbing hydrogen column density of @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "however , the fit was far from acceptable , with @xmath49 for @xmath50 degrees of freedom .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : convfits]b , the fit leaves several noticeable discrepancies , including a prominent data deficit above @xmath29 kev , and a data excess in 0.91.5 kev .",
    "obviously , the former is due to the high - energy cutoff , while the latter is due to the presence of soft excess , both of which have been established through previous observations .",
    "( 8cm,)cygx1_figure3.ps    to express the high - energy turn over , we next replaced the pl component with a cutoff power - law model ( ` cuoffpl ` ; a power - law times an exponential factor ) .",
    "to account for the soft excess , we also added a disk - blackbody component ( ` diskbb ` : @xcite ) to our fitting model .",
    "the ` diskbb ` model is a simple non - relativisitic approximation to the x - ray spectrum integrated over a standard accretion disk , and is considered to provide an approximately ( within @xmath51 ; @xcite ) correct innermost disk radius when an appropriate correction factor is incorporated @xcite .",
    "thus , the model is ` wabs*(diskbb+cutoffpl ) ` in the xspec terminology ; here , we utilize version 11 of the xspec spectral fitting package , together with the photoelectric absorption model , ` wabs ` , by @xcite .",
    "then , the fit was improved drastically to @xmath52 for @xmath53 , though not yet acceptable .",
    "the exponential cutoff energy was obtained as @xmath54 kev , and the nominal pl photon index decreased to @xmath55 .",
    "the innermost disk temperature of the ` diskbb ` component was obtained as @xmath56 0.5 kev , and its innermost radius as @xmath57 km at a distance of 2.5 kpc ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , without any correction for the color hardening factor , or inner boundary condition , or inclination ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we regard these ` diskbb ` parameters still unphysical .    in figure",
    "[ fig : convfits]c , the data to model ratios from the ` wabs*(diskbb+cutoffpl ) ` fit show a slight broad hump over 2040 kev ( though not very clear in this presentation ) , indicative of reflection from a cool thick material .",
    "in addition , there is clear evidence of fe - k line at about 6.4 kev .",
    "accordingly , we added a reflection component ( ` pexrav ` ; @xcite ) and a gaussian to our model , thus constructing a model ` wabs*(diskbb+cutoffpl+pexrav+gau ) ` , and repeated the fitting . in using ` pexrav ` , the reflector was assumed to have an inclination @xmath58 , and its incident photons to have the same spectral shape and normalization as those of the ` cutoffpl ` continuum ( ` rel_refl`@xmath59 technically ) .",
    "the gaussian was allowed to have a free centroid and a free width .",
    "then , the fit further improved to @xmath60 for @xmath61 , implying that the reflection is significantly present as reported by many previous observations .",
    "the model gave the ` cuoffpl ` parameters as @xmath62 and @xmath63 kev , and the ` diskbb ` parameters as @xmath64 kev and @xmath65 km .",
    "the reflector was found to have a moderate solid angle as @xmath66 , and the gaussian centroid and its width were obtained as @xmath67 kev and @xmath68 kev respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : convfits]a , we show this fit where contributions of the individual model components are separately drawn .",
    "the data - to - model ratios are given in figure  [ fig : convfits]d .",
    "thus , the reflection signal is inferred to carry @xmath45 30% of the continuum at 30 kev .    in this way",
    ", the empirical model fittings have roughly quantified the time - averaged suzaku spectra of cyg x-1 , and extracted their basic features .",
    "the fit implies a 0.7300 kev flux ( after absorption by @xmath69 ) of @xmath70 erg @xmath48 s@xmath1 . assuming an isotropic emission , and employing the distance of 2.5 kpc ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) ,",
    "the absorption - removed 0.7300 kev luminosity becomes @xmath71 erg s@xmath1 , which is typical of this object .",
    "although the fit still remains unacceptable , and hence errors associated with the model parameters can not be evaluated , further improving the model would be of little meaning , because ` cutoffpl ` is a mere empirical approximation to the spectra expected from unsaturated comptonization processes . instead , we proceed to more physical modelings , using theoretical comptonization codes .      among various comptonization codes currently available , here we employ that of poutanen & svensson ( 1996 ) , called ` compps ` in xspec , because of the following three advantages : it correctly takes into account the relativistic effects in the compton scattering kinematics ; it allows us to use a ` diskbb ` model as the seed photon source ; and it has a built - in function to allow a part of the initial compton - produced photons to get into a cold matter and reflected .",
    "we thus fitted the xis2 , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso spectra simultaneously by a ` wabs*(diskbb+compps ) ` model , in the same manner as before . at this stage , the reflection option in ` compps ` was suppressed , and the gaussian component was not included . here and hereafter , we assume that the compton cloud has a spherical geometry ( parameter=4 ) with an electron temperature @xmath72 and an optical depth @xmath73 , and that the seed photons to the ` compps ` component are supplied by a cool standard disk having the same @xmath74 ( but a separate normalization ) as the ` diskbb ` component .",
    "the implied picture is that some fraction of photons from a standard disk is fed to the comptonizing corona , while the rest is directly visible as the spectral soft excess .",
    "this picture is supported by the presence of a tight correlation between the continuum slope and the reflection strength in bhbs @xcite and in agns , which indicates that the optically - thick disk , producing the reflection , is also causally related to the comptonized emission .",
    "( 8cm,)cygx1_figure4.ps    as shown in figure  [ fig : comppsfits]b",
    ", this model gave a poor fit with @xmath75 for @xmath53 .",
    "since figure  [ fig : comppsfits]b reveals the reflection hump at @xmath76 kev , we activated the reflection option in ` compps ` .",
    "this has nearly the same effect as the ` pexrav ` model , but with two additional free parameters ; the ionization parameter @xmath77 in units of erg cm s@xmath1 , and the innermost reflector radius @xmath78 .",
    "the latter controls relativistic blurring of spectral features , and is expressed in units of the gravitational radius @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the bh mass and @xmath81 the gravitational constant .",
    "the outer radius was fixed at @xmath82 and the radial emissivity profile was assumed to depend on the radius @xmath83 as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the inclination angle , abundance , and temperature of the reflector were also fixed at @xmath85 , 1 solar , and @xmath86 k , respectively .",
    "we retained the gaussian component , because the ` compps ` reflection does not include any emission line . then ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : comppsfits]c , the fit was much improved ( @xmath87 with @xmath88 ) ; the reflection hump is significantly present with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , although @xmath78 was not constrained in this and all subsequent fits .",
    "the fit goodness is comparable to that obtained with the ` wabs*(diskbb+cutoffpl+pexrav+gau ) ` model ( figure  [ fig : convfits]d ) .",
    "while the conventional model failed to constrain @xmath91 , the present model gave an electron temperature of @xmath92 kev .    in figure",
    "[ fig : comppsfits]c , the fit still leaves a prominent data deficit in the highest xis range .",
    "in addition , the xis vs. hxd normalization ratio was obtained at 0.108 , which exceeds the nominal value of @xmath45 0.092 ( subsection  [ subsec : xisreduction ] ) ; this is too large , even considering uncertainties in the correction factors involved in the xis and hxd data processing ( section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "we hence suspect that the actual source continuum is rising from @xmath93 kev toward lower energies , with a steeper slope than indicated by the model , so that the fitting algorithm tried to absorb this mismatch by artificially raising the model prediction to the xis data .",
    "in other words , the broad - band continuum has a more concave shape over 220 kev ( see figure  [ fig : convfits]b ) , than would be explained by the ` compps ` component with reflection .",
    "this effect was previously noticed by @xcite as a soft excess that can not be accounted for by the cool disk emission .",
    "the same effect was noticed in the suzaku data of gro  j1655@xmath640 ( paper  i ) , and led @xcite to incorporate another ` compps ` component .",
    "such a `` double - compton '' modeling was previously applied successfully to the lhs of cyg x-1 in several works ; by @xcite and @xcite using simultaneous ginga , rxte , and cgor / osse data , and by @xcite to the bepposax data .",
    "we hence tried a model incorporating two comptonized continua , which are constrained to have the same seed - photon temperature ( which in turn is the same as that of ` diskbb ` ) , the same hot - electron temperature , and the same reflection parameters , but are allowed to differ in their normalization and optical depth .",
    "the model is hence ` wabs*(diskbb+compps+compps+gau ) ` .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : comppsfits]d , the fit has been improved drastically to @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) ; the xis , pin , and gso spectra are reproduced with @xmath96 1.3 , 0.9 , and 0.9 , respectively .",
    "the model has removed the data deficit in the highest xis range , and reduced a residual structure near 2 kev where the two ` compps ` components now cross over .",
    "furthermore , the xis vs. hxd normalization has became 0.088 , which is close to the value of 0.092 calibrated using ss cyg ( subsection  [ subsec : xisreduction ] ) .",
    "we are therefore confident that the suzaku data require two ( or possibly more ) compton components . although the fit is not yet formally acceptable , we regard it as satisfactory , because the data vs. model discrepancy , typically within 4% over the entire 0.7400 kev range , is comparable to those obtained when we fit the suzaku spectra of bright objects , such as the crab spectra , with simple models .",

    "( 7.5cm,)cygx1_figure5.ps",
    "although the analysis conducted in the preceding subsection has provided a plausible representation of the time - averaged spectra , different spectral models could often degenerate .",
    "therefore , let us briefly examine our final spectral model for its implications and physical consistency , leaving detailed discussion to section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the obtained absorption , @xmath100 @xmath48 , is close to the value of @xmath101 @xmath48 derived by @xcite with asca .",
    "the ` comppsh ` and ` comppss ` components , crossing at @xmath102 kev , are characterized by photon indices of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , with the former consistent with the approximate x - ray slope of cyg x-1 measured in energies of a few to a few tens kev .",
    "the underlying parameters , @xmath105 kev , @xmath73 of order unity , and @xmath106 , are consistent with a large number of past measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ` diskbb ` component has a raw innermost radius as @xmath107 km , which yields the best - estimate actual inner radius of @xmath108 km ; this is obtained by applying the nominal correction factors in @xcite ( including a color hardening factor of 1.7 ; @xcite ) to @xmath109 , and correcting for the inclination assuming @xmath58 , as @xmath110 this @xmath111 is larger than the value of @xmath112 km measured in the high / soft state with asca @xcite , suggesting a disk truncation at a larger radius than in the high / soft state ( see also subsection  [ subsec : diskpara ] ) .",
    "the innermost disk temperature , 0.19 kev , is a factor 2.3 lower than that measured in the high / soft state @xcite , consistent with a reduced accretion rate and possibly a larger innermost disk radius .",
    "these consistencies support ( though not necessarily prove ) our basic assumption that the seed photons for comptonization are provided by the optically - thick disk , as proposed previously @xcite .",
    "although the bolometric luminosity of the directly - visible disk emission is @xmath113% of the overall 0.7300 kev luminosity , the energy generation in the cool disk is approximately twice higher , when the seed photon luminosity is added . then , the energy generation in the the cool disk becomes comparable to that in the hot corona .",
    "while the ` comppsh ` component carries the dominant hard continuum , ` comppss ` successfully explains the continuum steepening in energies below a few kev , or equivalently , the soft excess that is too hot to be explained by the cool disk emission @xcite .",
    "these two compton continua are inferred to have optical depths which differ by a factor of @xmath114 .",
    "their normalizations , originally expressed as the disk area @xmath115 supplying the seed photons , have been converted in table  [ tbl : parameters ] to its innermost radius @xmath116 as @xmath117 though similar to @xmath111 of equation  ( [ eq : rin2rin ] ) , @xmath116 is _ not _ corrected for the inclination , since we presume the comptonized emission to be approximately isotropic . as seen in table  [ tbl : parameters ] ,",
    "the value of @xmath116 associated with ` comppss ` is comparable to @xmath111 , while that of ` comppsh ` is considerably smaller .",
    "we hence obtain an implication that @xmath118 times more seed photons are fed to ` comppss ` than to ` comppsh ` : a further discussion continues in subsection  [ subsec : diskpara ] .    although the final model is generally successful , the obtained xis vs. hxd normalization , 0.088 , is @xmath119 too small .",
    "when this ratio is fixed to the calibration value of 0.092 , the pin data exhibit some positive and negative residuals at @xmath120 kev and @xmath121 kev , respectively .",
    "these can be eliminated by allowing ` comppss ` and ` comppsh ` to have a larger ( @xmath122 ) and a slightly smaller ( @xmath123 ) value of @xmath124 , respectively , with the raw chi - square reducing by 13 ( for @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is because the reflection associated with ` comppss ` appears at lower energies than those with ` comppsh ` ( figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels]a ) .",
    "there is thus some indication that the softer compton signals are more strongly reflected by cold materials than the harder one .    when the two ` compps ` components are allowed to take different values of @xmath72 , tolerances of the model parameters increase , but the fit goodness remains the same",
    "this is because the high - energy roll over of ` comppss ` is masked by ` comppsh ` .",
    "therefore , we do not adopt this modeling , although the data do not necessarily exclude the presence of multiple electron temperatures .",
    "now that the time - averaged spectra have been quantified in section  [ sec : ana_avspec ] , we proceed to the latter half of our data analysis , namely attempts to understand how the spectrum changes as the source varies randomly ; a similar attempt was carried out previously by @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , it is essential to sort the broad - band spectra , particularly those of the hxd , into two subsets , according to whether the instantaneous source count rate is higher or lower than a certain mean value .",
    "however , the hxd has a relatively small effective area ( @xmath126 @xmath127 at 100 kev ; @xcite ) , so the average count rates of cyg x-1 are @xmath128 c s@xmath1 and @xmath129 c s@xmath1 in the 1070 kev ( with pin ) and 70400 kev ( with gso ) bands , respectively ( subsection  [ subsec : obs ] ; figure  [ fig : ltcurves]c , d ) .",
    "then , even in the pin range where the nxb is relatively minor , poisson fluctuations of signal counts with 1 s integration would become comparable to the intrinsic variations of cyg x-1 ( @xmath130% in root - mean - square amplitude ) . making the integration time longer would not help , because cyg x-1 varies with an approximately `` white '' power spectrum on time scales longer than a few seconds ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and hence amplitudes of the intrinsic and poisson variations will scale in a similar manner when the integration time is increased .    fortunately , we can utilize the xis for our purpose , because one xis sensor received @xmath131 c s@xmath1 even after the image center has been removed to avoid photon pile up ( subsection [ subsec : xisreduction ] ; figure  [ fig : ltcurves]a , b ) , and the variation of cyg x-1 is known to be crudely synchronized across the soft x - ray to hard x - ray energies @xcite . since the present xis data have a 1 s time resolution ( subsection [ subsec : obs ] ) , we can judge every second , referring to the xis data , whether the source is brighter or fainter than a mean , and sort the xis and hxd data into the required two subsets . in practice ,",
    "we have constructed the following procedure to do this .    1 .   in the same way as in section  [ subsec",
    ": obs_ltcurve ] , a 0.310 kev xis0+xis3 light curve @xmath132 ( with @xmath133 the bin number ) is produced throughout the observation , with a bin width of @xmath134 s. 2 .   the calculation of @xmath132 excludes those 1-s time bins in which either xis0 or xis3 ( or both ) suffered telemetry saturation .",
    "every @xmath135 s ( @xmath136 ) , a mean xis0+xis3 count rate @xmath137 is calculated from @xmath132 .",
    "two sets of good time intervals ( gtis ) , called `` high - phase '' ( hp ) and `` low - phase '' ( lp ) , are defined , by judging every @xmath138 s whether @xmath139 is higher than @xmath140 , or lower than @xmath141 , respectively . here , @xmath142 is 1-sigma poisson error and @xmath143 is a discriminator level .",
    "5 .   using the same two gtis ,",
    "the xis2 data are accumulated into two spectra , called hp ( high phase ) and lp ( low phase ) spectra .",
    "the data are discarded if @xmath144 .",
    "6 .   employing the same two gtis ,",
    "the hxd - pin data are sorted into hp and lp spectra ; so are the hxd - gso data . 7 .   using the two sets of gtis ,",
    "two background data sets are accumulated for hp and lp , and are subtracted from the corresponding on - source hxd spectra .",
    "thus , the procedure involves three adjustable parameters , @xmath138 , @xmath135 , and @xmath145 . among them",
    ", @xmath135 should be long enough to suppress poisson errors , but short enough to compensate for background changes .",
    "the threshold @xmath145 should also be optimized , because a larger @xmath145 leads to a decrease of live time , while a smaller @xmath145 means that the data sorting is diluted by the poisson fluctuation in @xmath132 which is not related to the intrinsic source variation . here , for simplicity , we have chosen @xmath146 s ( the highest time resolution of the xis ) , @xmath147 s , and @xmath148 as our baseline conditions .",
    "this is because a larger value of @xmath145 , such as @xmath149 , was found to enhances the hp vs. lp ratio , but also to degrade the data statistics , thus hampering us to more accurately separate the hp and lp model parameters . since we have chosen to use the xis0+xis3 data for the intensity judgement ,",
    "we derive the intensity - sorted xis spectra only from the other fi sensor , namely xis2 .",
    "this division of task is needed because the intensity - sorted spectra from xis0 and xis3 would include those time bins when their summed counts are higher ( or lower ) due simply to statistical fluctuations , which amount to @xmath150 ( 1 sigma ) at the 1-s integration .",
    "the intensity - sorted spectra from xis0 and xis3 , if to be utilized in the spectral fitting , would need to be corrected for this effect .",
    "the xis2 data , in contrast , are free from this problem , because poisson errors from different detectors are independent .      before actually conducting the analysis described in section  [ subsec : varspec_method ] , we briefly perform auto - correlation function ( acf ) and cross - correlation function ( ccf ) analyses , in order to examine whether the gtis sorted in reference to the energy band below 10 kev is really applicable to the extraction of varying spectral components in harder energies .",
    "we utilize raw light curves with neither background subtraction nor dead - time correction .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) of figure  [ fig : acf_ccf ] show acfs and ccfs from the present suzaku data , respectively , calculated employing a bin width of 1 s. they were calculated using data intervals each 256 s long , and then averaged over ensemble .",
    "the xis telemetry saturation was treated in the same way as item 2 of the previous subsection ( using @xmath146 s ) .",
    "thus , the xis vs. pin and xis vs. gso ccfs both exhibit clear peaks at zero time lag , with correlation coefficients of @xmath151 .",
    "this ensures that the intrinsic variation on a time scale of 1 s is well correlated over the entire energy range in which we are conducting our analysis , and validate our method described in the previous subsection .",
    "although the xis data do not have time resolution higher than 1 s , the hxd data afford it down to @xmath152s @xcite .",
    "we calculated acfs and ccfs from the pin ( 1060 kev ) and gso ( 60200 kev ) light curves accordingly , with 0.1 s resolution and 409.6 s data intervals .",
    "the results , shown in panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig : acf_ccf ] , reveal that the variations are detected on shorter time scales , where the pin vs gso correlation is still peaked at zero - lag .",
    "the variations in the two energy bands are again well synchronized , with the correlation coefficient of @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the basic properties described above , these acfs and ccfs reveal one interesting property : namely , the left - to - right asymmetry in the ccfs , seen on both time scales , in such a way that the correlation is stronger toward hard - lag sense .",
    "this reconfirms the previous report of the same phenomenon in early days by @xcite , then using ginga by @xcite , and further with rxte ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the present results do not clearly reconform another property , reported previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) , that acfs in softer energies have wider correlation peaks , and hence longer correlation lengths .",
    "we leave this issue to future suzaku observations using higher xis time resolution ( employing so - called psum mode ) ; then , we will also be able to study how the spectrum differs between the rising and falling phases of  shots \" , as suggested previously @xcite .",
    "( 16cm,)cygx1_figure6.ps    ( 14cm,)cygx1_figure7.ps      now that the examination of ccfs have validated the method presented in section  [ subsec : varspec_method ] ,",
    "we have applied it to the present suzaku data .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltcurve_1sec ] gives an example of 1-s bin light curves of cyg x-1 , sorted according to the above method using the baseline condition ; @xmath146 s , @xmath147 s , and @xmath148 ( section  [ subsec : varspec_method ] ) . in this particular example , the average xis count rate used as the hp vs. lp threshold is 140 and 148 ct s@xmath1 in the former and latter 200 s , respectively .",
    "these are @xmath153 higher than the xis2 counting rate indicated by figure  [ fig : ltcurves ] ( panels a , b ) , because the xis2 optical axis is more offset from the 1/8-window centroid than those of xis0 and xis3 , causing a larger photon loss .",
    "the xis light curve reveals the well known flickering behavior of cyg x-1 , while those of the hxd suffer larger poisson errors so that the intensity sorting on a time scale of 1 s is impossible without the xis data .",
    "figure  [ fig : hilo_spec ] shows the hp and lp spectra derived in this way .",
    "there , we subtracted the corresponding backgrounds accumulated using the respective gtis ( item 7 in section  [ subsec : varspec_method ] ) : the utilized two background sets agree within their statistical errors . while the spectra are presented without dead time correction , we correct the model nomalizations ( in table  [ tbl : parameters ] and elsewhere in text ) for the time - averaged dead time of 7% .",
    "although the hp and lp spectra should have different dead times , the difference is calculated to be within @xmath36 , because the dead time is mainly caused by background counts .",
    "this difference is expected to reduce the hp spectral normalization by at most @xmath154 , keeping the spectral shape intact .",
    "figure  [ fig : hilo_spec]b gives the ratios between the hp and lp spectra , with several important implications .",
    "first , the average ratio becomes @xmath155 , in agreement with the typical variation amplitude of cyg x-1 .",
    "second , the ratio increases at the highest xis energies band , but this is due to still remaining photon pile - up effects in the xis when the source gets brighter , and should be ignored .",
    "third , the spectrum gets slightly softer when the source brightens up , as evidenced by a gradual decrease of the hp / lp ratio toward higher energies ; this qualitatively agrees with previous results from , e.g. , ginga ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the hp / lp ratio exhibits a rather abrupt decrease at @xmath12 kev toward lower energies .",
    "( 8cm,)cygx1_figure8.ps    in order to see the effects of changing the selection condition , we repeated the intensity sorting using @xmath156 s and 8 s. the results obtained with @xmath156 s were essentially the same as those with the baseline case ( @xmath157 1 s ) .",
    "when employing @xmath158 s , the hp / lp ratio was reduced to @xmath159 on average , although its energy dependence was very similar to the baseline case . from these , we retain @xmath157 1 s. we also examined different poisson thresholds , @xmath145 .",
    "when @xmath148 ( the baselline case ) , 1 , and 2 are used , the hp gtis yielded an overall exposure of 7.3 , 5.2 , and 3.3 ks , respectively ( with lp gti being comparable ) , while the energy - averaged hp / lp ratio turned out to be @xmath155 , @xmath160 , and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we hence retain @xmath148 , since it maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio of the hp minus lp difference spectra .    returning to the hp and lp spectra obtained with the baseline condition , we tried grossly quantifying them using the conventional model employed in section  [ subsec : convfits ] . to avoid the complexity in softer energies which arisses from the iron line , the soft excess , and the softer compnotization continuum",
    ", we fitted only the hxd ( pin and gso ) spectra , using the ` cutoffpl+pexrav ` model .",
    "the model reproduced the hp and lp spectra successfully both with @xmath161 , and yielded the consistent reflection strength ; @xmath162 in hp and @xmath163 in lp .",
    "( these are smaller than the value of @xmath1640.4 obtained with the time - averaged spectra using the compnonization models , because a cutoff power - law model is more convex than an unsaturated compton continuum . )    to highlight the difference between the two spectra , we next fitted them jointly , with @xmath124 fixed at 0.16 . as show in table  [ tbl : hilo_convfits ] ( column under an entry `` free '' ) , we were unable to find statistically significant differences either in @xmath165 or @xmath166 . therefore , we further constrained the hp and lp spectra to have either the same @xmath165 or the same @xmath166 .",
    "then , as shown in the last two columns of table  [ tbl : hilo_convfits ] , the join fit remained acceptable without preference between the two cases , and the unconstrained parameter showed a statistically significant difference between the two spectra .",
    "we therefore conclude that the hp and lp spectral have different shapes as suggested by their ratio ( figure  [ fig : hilo_spec]b ) , and that either @xmath166 or @xmath165 ( or both ) is changing , although we can not determine which is more variable .",
    "( 7.5cm,)cygx1_figure9.ps      following the approximate quantification of the intensity - sorted hxd spectra ( subsection  [ subsec : sortedspec ] ) , we fitted the full ( xis2 , pin , and gso ) hp and lp spectra with the ` wabs*(diskbb + compps+compps+gau ) ` model which has been found to be the best representation of the time - averaged spectrum ( section  [ subsec : comppsfits ] ) . in the fitting , we fixed @xmath167 @xmath48 as obtained with the average spectra . in reference to the preliminary fittings conducted in the previous subsection",

    "( 7.5cm,)cygx1_figure10.ps    table  [ tbl : parameters ] and figure  [ fig : hilo_bestfitmodels ] allow us to derive several important inferences . first , let us consider the observed spectral softening from lp to hp ( figure  [ fig : hilo_spec]b ) .",
    "although this effect might suggest an increased relative contribution of ` comppss ` in hp , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , as the source varies , the seed - disk radius of ` comppss ` is kept at @xmath169 times that of ` comppsh ` ( table  [ tbl : parameters ] ) , and their cross - over energy stays at @xmath102 kev ( figure  [ fig : hilo_bestfitmodels ] ) . in search for an alternative explanation ,",
    "figure  [ fig : hilo_contours ] compares the ` comppsh ` parameters between hp and lp on the plane of @xmath72 against the optical depth @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the hp and lp spectra become distinct on this plane , with implication similar to what was derived in subsection  [ subsec : sortedspec ] ; the two phases can not be represented by a common set of @xmath72 and @xmath170 .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath72 is the same , then @xmath170 must be lower in hp than in lp ; if instead @xmath170 is assumed to be the same , @xmath72 must be higher in lp .",
    "the two phases are more clearly ( though not completely ) separated in @xmath10 , because it can be accurately specified by the observed spectral slopes .",
    "we may , for simplicity , express that the hard continuum is `` less strongly comptonized '' in hp than in lp .",
    "this is an important result enabled by the broad - band capability of suzaku . as to ` comppss ` , we can not find significant differences between lp and hp beyond their relatively large errors .",
    "( 8cm,)cygx1_figure11.ps    next , the source variation has been found to approximately conserve the innermost disk temperature at @xmath171 kev ( table  [ tbl : parameters ] ) . in the present modeling , this quantity is assumed to be common to the directly visible ` diskbb ` component , and the seed photon sources for the two ` compps ` components .",
    "therefore , it is determined mainly by local shapes of the spectral soft excess ( figure  [ fig : hilo_bestfitmodels ] ) . however",
    ", the broad - band capability is again very important , because it allows us to accurately fix the compton continua and the reflection hump , and hence to unambiguously model the soft excess .    as a third result from this analysis",
    ", we can attribute the lp to hp intensity increase to an increase in the spherically - averaged seed - photon luminosity , which is given as @xmath172 here , @xmath173 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , while @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively represent the seed - disk radius of ` comppsh ` and ` comppss ` , as defined by equation ( [ eq : seeddisk ] ) . when @xmath176 is estimated table  [ tbl : parameters ] via equation  [ eq : lseed ] , its nominal error ranges overlap between hp and lp , due to large errors in @xmath116 .",
    "however , in reality , @xmath116 is tightly anti - correlated with @xmath74 so as to preserve the seed - photon flux ( for ` compps ` in particular ) .",
    "therefore , the combined error range of @xmath176 becomes much smaller .",
    "a detailed confidence - range examination yields @xmath177 erg s@xmath1 in hp , and @xmath178 erg s@xmath1 in lp .    finally , the bolometric luminosity of the directly - visible ` diskbb ` component , calculated after equation ( [ eq : lseed ] ) as @xmath179 and presented in table  [ tbl : parameters ] , is consistent with being the same between lp and hp , within rather large errors which arise mainly via a strong coupling between ` diskbb ` and ` comppss ` .",
    "these error ranges associated with @xmath180 , which also take into account the temperature vs. radius anti correlation , are such that a significant decrease ( by as much as a factor of @xmath38 ) in @xmath180 from lp to hp is allowed , while its increases should not exceed @xmath181 .",
    "we therefore infer , as our 4th result , that the directly visible disk luminosity is likely to be less variable than the hard x - ray flux , and there remains a possibility that it even anti - correlates with the hard x - ray flux .      to reconfirm and reinforce the results obtained in the preceding subsection , we directly subtracted the raw ( i.e. , background - inclusive and dead - time uncorrected ) lp spectra from those in hp .",
    "since the source resides in either phase for a typical duration of several seconds which is much shorter than the time scale of the nxb variation , we expect the nxb to accurately cancel out by this subtraction , making  difference spectra \" free from the nxb modeling errors .",
    "in fact , over the highest energy of 530600 kev where the signal is considered negligible ( @xmath182 of the nxb ) , the hp minus lp count rate of hxd - gso has been found to be @xmath183 of the time - averaged mean rate .",
    "this also confirms that the potentially higher ( by at most 2% ; subsection  [ subsec : sortedspec ] ) dead time in hp than in lp can be neglected .",
    "the derived difference spectra are presented in figure  [ fig : hilo_comppsfits]c .",
    "as expected , they have several times smaller normalizations than the hp and lp spectra , and are generally softer .    as before , we fitted the difference spectra using the progressively complex comptonization models , but fixing @xmath184 @xmath48 , @xmath185 kev , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",
    "the systematic errors were not incorporated due to lower statistics .",
    "then , a single ` compps ` continuum , together with reflection and the ` diskbb ` component , gave a poor fit with @xmath189 for @xmath190 .",
    "the fit goodness was improve to @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) by activating the gaussian component , of which the center energy and the width are fixed at 6.3 kev and @xmath193 kev , respectively .",
    "finally , by incorporating the second ` compps ` component , the fit has become fully acceptable ( @xmath194 for @xmath195 ) , yielding the parameters given in table  [ tbl : parameters ] ( column before the last ) .",
    "thus , the model has again the same construction as those for the time - averaged , hp , and lp spectra .",
    "the best - fit model is presented in figure  [ fig : hilo_comppsfits]c in the convolved form , and in figure [ fig : hilo_bestfitmodels]c in the incident @xmath97 form .",
    "below , we examine the fit results .    in the difference spectra ,",
    "the ` comppss ` component has been found to have again @xmath196 times larger seed - disk radius than ` comppsh ` . since this ratio is close to those found in the average , hp , and lp spectra , we reconfirm that the soft - photon inputs to the two compton clouds are varying roughly in proportion to each other . in contrast , the value of @xmath197 kev is considerably lower than was found before .",
    "one possible scenario from these results is that the compton - cloud temperature in fact has a distribution , which becomes more weighted toward lower values as the source flares up , so that the difference can be approximated by a single lower temperature .",
    "in subsection [ subsec : sortedspec ] , we confirmed ( though using the conventional model ) that the hp and lp spectra have roughly the same @xmath124 .",
    "this is reinforced by the results obtained subsequently , namely the successful double - compton modelings of the hp , lp , and the difference spectra , all with @xmath198 fixed at 0.4 .",
    "therefore , the reflection component is thought to be fully catching up with the continuum variations on the 1-s time scale . also , the iron - line photon flux is varying clearly on this time scale ; its variation is consistent with being directly proportional to the continuum flux , because all the four spectra of cyg x-1 presented in table  [ tbl : parameters ] have , within errors , the same fe - k line equivalent width of @xmath22 ev",
    ". these results are consistent with @xcite , who reported that the reflection features ( fe - k line and smeared edge ) start failing to follow continuum variations above several hz in frequency .",
    "although the fit to the difference spectrum incorporates the ` diskbb ` component , the final model given in table  [ tbl : parameters ] does not necessarily require it : only an upper limit can be imposed on @xmath111 , because the softest end of the difference xis spectrum can be accounted for by ` comppss ` as well .",
    "we in fact confirmed that a negative normalization of ` diskbb ` ( i.e. , a decrease of this component from lp to hp ) is allowed up to @xmath121% ( in absolute value ) of those in lp .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained in the previous subsection .      through the analyses in the preceding three subsections , the spectra changes associated with the fast (",
    "1 to 200 s ) intensity variations have been quantified in the following manner .    1 .",
    "the intensity increase from lp to hp is explained by an increase in the seed - photon luminosity , @xmath176 .",
    "2 .   the spectral softening from lp to hp can be attributed to weakening in the comptonization of ` comppsh ` ( either small @xmath73 , or lower @xmath72 , or both ) .",
    "3 .   unlike @xmath176 , the directly visible disk luminosity , @xmath180 , does not increase significantly in hp , and could even decrease .",
    "as the source varies , the innermost temperature of the cool disk is kept approximately constant at @xmath185 kev .",
    "5 .   on these time scales ,",
    "the fe - k line and the reflection hump follow the continuum variations , because @xmath124 and the fe - k line ew are both consistent with being constant .",
    "the suzaku observation of cyg x-1 , conducted for an exposure of 17 ks at a 0.7300 kev luminosity of @xmath71 erg s@xmath1 , has provided one of the highest - quality lhs spectra of this prototypical bhb .",
    "the xis , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso spectra , altogether covering an extremely broad energy band of 0.7400 kev , have been explained simultaneously and consistently , by invoking two basic constituents of the x - ray emission .",
    "one is the hot comptonizing corona with @xmath105 kev , which manifests itself in the high - energy spectral roll over detected with a high significance by hxd - gso .",
    "the other is the optically - thick cool disk with @xmath199 kev , which produces the soft excess and the fe - k line in the xis band , as well as the reflection hump in the hxd - pin band with @xmath106 .",
    "the data are fully consistent with the cool disk supplying seed photons to the compton cloud , although other possibilities may not be necessarily excluded . in the present modeling ,",
    "the soft photons from the cool disk are considered to reach us either directly as the soft excess ( the ` diskbb ` component ) , or through weaker comptonization with @xmath200 ( ` comppss ` ) , or after experiencing stronger comptonization with @xmath201 ( ` comppsh ` ) .    assembling together the two compton components ( ` comppsh , comppss ` ) and",
    "the three cool - disk related ones ( ` diskbb ` , reflection , and gaussian ) , we have successfully reproduced the overall continuum shape , including the complicated fe - k line and soft - excess regions .",
    "the fe - k line is inferred to be broadened only weakly to @xmath12 kev ( in gaussian @xmath142 ) , without any evidence for relativistically broadened wings of which the detection is claimed from some bhbs @xcite . as seen in figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels ]",
    ", the inferred incident spectrum shows too complicated a shape , all over the energy range , to be approximated by a single power - law .    analyzing in section  [ sec : ana_varspec ] the characteristic flare - up behavior of cyg x-1 on a time scale of @xmath12 s , we found that the ` wabs*(diskbb+compps+compps+gau ) ` modeling applies also to the hp , lp , and the difference spectra .",
    "the flare - up behavior can be understood primarily as an increase in the seed - photon supply , accompanied by a decreased comptonization .",
    "while the seed - disk luminosity thus increases in hp , the luminosity of the directly visible ` diskbb ` does not increase significantly .",
    "as the source varies , @xmath74 of the cool disk is kept approximately constant .      applying the double-`compps ` modeling to the bepposax data of cyg x-1 in the lhs covering up to @xmath202 kev ( whereas suzaku reached 400 kev ) , @xcite derived @xmath203 kev , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 for ` comppsh ` ( their compton component 1 ) , and @xmath206 kev and @xmath207 for ` comppss ` ( their ` copmps ` component 2 ) . except for some differences in the model parameters ,",
    "the suzaku and bepposax results are hence consistent in that the broad - band spectra can be reproduced by a pair of comptonized components .",
    "the two results grossly agree on the soft - excess parameters as well , although @xcite used a blackbody to model the soft excess and the seed - photon source .",
    "the bepposax observation was conducted at a 0.5200 kev unabsorbed flux of @xmath208 erg @xmath48 s@xmath1 , or a luminosity of @xmath209 erg s@xmath1 ( in the same band at a distance of 3.2 kpc ) .",
    "the corresponding values from the present suzaku observation are higher , @xmath210 erg @xmath48 s@xmath211 ( @xmath212 erg s@xmath1 ) .",
    "then , we would expect suzaku to observe a lower @xmath72 , based on the general understanding that @xmath72 decreases toward higher luminosities due to enhanced compton cooling ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we in fact measured a 1.6 times _ higher _ @xmath72 than bepposax .",
    "one possible explanation to this behavior is that cyg x-1 may not have fully returned to the lhs at the time of the bepposax observation , which was conducted soon after the source transition from the high / soft state .",
    "prior to the present work , the double - compton model was applied successfully to wide - band lhs spectra of cyg x-1 ( @xcite ; though some explicitly invoking multiple values of @xmath72 ) and gro  j1655@xmath640 ( paper  i , subsection  [ subsec:1655_cyg ] ) .",
    "therefore , we regard this model as a promising description of the lhs spectra of bhbs .",
    "as discussed in paper  i , the mixture of two compton optical depths ( plus the direct ` diskbb ` component ) allows either a `` spatial '' or a `` time - domain '' interpretation . in the former case ,",
    "some fraction of the cool disk is considered directly visible , while the remaining part is covered by a hot electron cloud that has thinner and thicker portions . the latter ( time domain )",
    "alternative assumes that the compton cloud is rapidly varying among three typical conditions , represented by @xmath213 , @xmath214 , and @xmath215 .",
    "the actual condition may be a combination of these two simplified cases .",
    "of course , as pointed out previously ( e.g. , paper  i ) , the double - compton modeling may be an approximation to more complex conditions involving more than two compton optical depths , or even a continuous distribution in @xmath73 as suggested by some models ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with the present data , it is virtually impossible to distnguish which is more likely , a continuous distributin in @xmath73 or just two optical depths .",
    "a comparison between cyg x-1 ( with @xmath16 ) and gro  j1655@xmath640 ( with @xmath17 ) would help elucidating the source geometry ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "after a brief attempt made in paper  1 using the bepposax results on cyg x-1 @xcite , here we perform a more accurate comparison between the two objects using the suzaku data on both . for this purpose ,",
    "figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels]b reproduces the best - fit ` wabs*(diskbb+compps+compps+gau ) ` model for gro  j1655@xmath640 , deduced in paper  i using the suzaku data . on that occasion ( 2005",
    "september 22 and 23 ) , gro  j1655@xmath640 was in the lhs with a 0.7300 kev luminosity of @xmath216 erg s@xmath1 ( paper  i ) , which is an order of magnutude lower than that of cyg x-1 in the present observation ( both assuming isotropic emission ) .",
    "however , the difference becomes a factor of 35 when the luminosity is normalized to the eddington value , because the bh in cyg x-1 has a mass of @xmath217 , while that in gro  j1655@xmath640 has @xmath218 ( paper  i ) .",
    "( 8cm,)cygx1_figure12.ps",
    "although the two models in figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels ] generally look alike , they differ in details .",
    "to grasp such differences in a model - independent manner , we divided the xi2 , hxd - pin , and hxd - gso spectra of gro  j1655@xmath640 by the corresponding spectra of cyg x-1 , and obtained the results shown in figure  [ fig:1655_cyg_specratio ] .",
    "below , we attempt to identify basic features in this spectral ratio , and to interpret them in terms of the spectral decomposition in figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels ] and table  [ tbl : parameters ] . like in figure  [ fig : hilo_spec]b , the behavior of the ratio at the highest xis energy range should be ignored , where the gro  j1655@xmath640 data may suffer from photon pile - up effects ( paper  i ) .",
    "the spectral ratio in figure  [ fig:1655_cyg_specratio ] is roughly constant over @xmath196 to @xmath76 kev , but decreases significantly below @xmath219 kev .",
    "this effect is too large to be explained by their difference in absorption , @xmath167 @xmath48 in cyg x-1 and @xmath220 @xmath48 in gro  j1655@xmath640 .",
    "instead , it can be attributed to the stronger soft excess of cyg x-1 ( figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels ] ) , as the ` diskbb ` component of cyg x-1 is an order of magnitude more prominent than that of gro  j1655@xmath640 when normalized to the overall continuum ( while @xmath74 is nearly the same ) .",
    "this in turn may be ascribed primarily to their difference in the @xmath221 factor , @xmath222 , because we expect the direct disk emission to scale as @xmath223 , while the comptonized emission to be approximately isotropic . strictly speaking ,",
    "this estimate needs some caution . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : hilo_comppsfits ] , we introduced two quantities , @xmath180 and @xmath176 . because @xmath111 used to calculate @xmath180",
    "has already been corrected for the @xmath221 factor while @xmath116 is not ( subsection  [ subsec : comppsfits ] , table  [ tbl : parameters ] ) , we expect the ratio @xmath224 to be approximately inclination independent .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio was measured to be @xmath225 in cyg x-1 , while @xmath226 in gro  j1655@xmath640 ( table  [ tbl : parameters ] ) .",
    "that is , the soft excess in gro  j1655@xmath640 is even weaker than would be predicted by the assumed @xmath227 .",
    "this is discussed later in subsection  [ subsec : variation ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig:1655_cyg_specratio ] , we observe a small dip at @xmath228 kev . evidently , this feature arises because the cyg x-1 spectrum exhibits a stronger fe - k line ( with an equivalent width of @xmath22 ev ) than that of gro  j1655@xmath640 ( @xmath229 ev ) .",
    "this property is again ascribed , at least qualitatively , to the inclination effects : the cool flat disk will intercept a fraction of the comptonized photons , and produce the fluorescent fe - k photons , of which the visibility must be proportional to @xmath230 .",
    "quantitatively , however , the difference in the equivalent width between the two sources amounts to a factor of @xmath102 , which exceeds the factor @xmath219 difference expected from @xmath227 .",
    "this is also discussed in subsection  [ subsec : variation ] .    over the 30200 kev range , the ratio in figure  [ fig:1655_cyg_specratio ] increases with energy the @xmath231 roughly as @xmath232 :",
    "gro  j1655@xmath640 has a harder continuum .",
    "this is consistent with the pl approximation to their hard x - ray spectra , which gave @xmath233 for cyg x-1 ( section  [ subsec : convfits ] ) and @xmath234 for gro  j1655@xmath640 ( paper  i ) . in terms of the comptonization scenario ,",
    "this slope difference can be attributed to the higher @xmath10-parameter of ` comppsh ` in gro  j1655@xmath640 ( @xmath235 ) than in cyg x-1 ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "this in turn can be explained rather securely by the higher @xmath72 of gro  j1655@xmath640 , unlike the case of the hp vs. lp comparison of cyg x-1 in which the origin of the change in @xmath10 remained ambiguous .",
    "as discussed in paper  i and subsection  [ subsec : bepposax ] , the higher @xmath72 of gro  j1655@xmath640 may be due to its lower luminosity .    in the pin energy range ,",
    "the ratio of figure  [ fig:1655_cyg_specratio ] exhibits a slightly concave curvature . because the continuta themselves in this energy range should be simple power - laws dominated by ` comppsh ` , this effect must be caused by differences in the reflection features .",
    "in fact , figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels ] reveals two effects .",
    "one is that the reflection hump of cyg x-1 , relative to the compton continuum , is inferred to be stronger than that in gro  j1655@xmath640 .",
    "this is again considered an inclination effect , because the reflected component is expected to be proportional to @xmath221 while the primary continuum is thought to be rather isotropic .",
    "actually , the values of @xmath124 in table  [ tbl : parameters ] , which is calculated _ after correction _ for @xmath221 , becomes comparable between the two objects .",
    "the other effect is that the reflection hump in cyg x-1 , modeled with @xmath237 , emerges at 3050 kev , whereas that of gro  j1655@xmath640 , modeled with @xmath238 , is peaked at higher energies .",
    "this is because a larger @xmath133 makes the reflection more forward directed , and hence the reflected photons suffer less compton degradation @xcite .",
    "these two effects in combination are considered to produce the slightly concave - shaped spectral ratio in the pin band . incidentally , the comparable values of @xmath124 between the two objects disfavors the idea that the hot comptonizing corona may have a semi - relativistic outflow velocity away from the disk plane @xcite , because in that case we would observe a smaller value of @xmath124 from cyg x-1 due to the enhanced continuum .    to summarize , the spectrum of cyg x-1 and gro  j1655@xmath640 are both dominated by the comptonized continua , but cyg x-1 exhibits more prominently the flat - disk - related spectral features presumably due to its lower inclination .",
    "another inclination effect manifests itself in the subtle differences in the 1070 kev continuum shape , presumably due to inclination - dependent changes in the strength and peak energy of the reflection hump .",
    "these results are consistent with the view that the comptonizing hot cloud is geometrically thick , and hence its emission depends much less on the inclination than the flat - disk related components .    analyzing broad - band bepposax spectra of xte  j1118 + 480",
    ", @xcite discovered that this transient bhb has a very weak soft excess and a weak reflection hump .",
    "like the present discussion on gro  j1655@xmath640 , these properties of xte  j1118 + 480 may also be ascribed to the inclination effects , since this object is also reported to have a rather high inclination as @xmath239 @xcite .      in the high / soft state of cyg",
    "x-1 , a ` diskbb ` fit to the asca data showed the optically - thick disk to have @xmath240  km @xcite , which translate via equation  ( [ eq : rin2rin ] ) to @xmath241  km for @xmath242 @xcite or @xmath243  km for @xmath58 . the disk is securely considered to reach the last stable orbit @xcite . in the lhs ,",
    "a similar cool disk is considered to be present as well , but its conditions become significantly more difficult to estimate , because its emission is overwhelmed and strongly modified by the compton process . as a result , there is considerable controversy over the innermost disk radius in the lhs .",
    "theoretically , the advection dominanted accretion flows @xcite and other related hot flow models , meant to explain the lhs , all assume that the cool disk is truncated at some radius larger than the last stable orbit .",
    "( one important difference is that the original adaf model assumes synchrotron photons as the soft seed photons to be compton up - scatterd into hard x - rays , whereas the present scenario assumes the cool disk to supply the seed soft photons . )",
    "a gradual inward shift in this truncation radius will give rise to the correlated spectral softening , increased reflection , and increased variation power frequencies , as observed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when the disk reaches the last stable orbit , a transition to the high / soft state will take place .",
    "however , this view has been challenged by some lhs observations which suggest the disk to extend down to the last stable orbit @xcite .",
    "here we use the broad - band suzaku data to infer the disk parameters in the lhs .",
    "in subsection  [ subsec : convfits ] , the conventional ` diskbb+cutoffpl ` fit to the present lhs data tentatively gave @xmath244 km , and hence @xmath245  km for @xmath58 .",
    "this apparently implies that the cool disk extends down to a much smaller radius than in the high / soft state .",
    "however , as pointed out before @xcite and revealed by the present data ( figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels ] ) , the lhs spectra of cyg x-1 and other bhbs are significantly more complex than is described by a single power - law .",
    "in fact , our final solution invoking double ` compps ` has given an order of magnitude larger value , @xmath246 km ( table  [ tbl : parameters ] ) , which is consistent with the disk inner radius receding by a factor 2.5 compared to the high / soft state . the large difference in @xmath111 between the two modelings for the same data can be explained in the following manner . in our final model , the flux in the 12 kev range",
    "is mostly explained by ` comppss ` ( figure  [ fig : bestfitmodels]a ) , with ` diskbb ` carrying softer residuals .",
    "if , instead , a single straight continuum is employed , the ` diskbb ` component becomes unusually hot trying to explain the 12 kev excess @xcite , and hence the inner disk radius becomes apparently too small .",
    "this gives a lesson that disentangling the disk parameters , where the disk is not the dominant component in the spectrum , is subject to large uncertainties in the underlying continuum shape .",
    "evidently , the case of gro  1655@xmath640 is subject to larger difficulties because of the weaker soft excess .",
    "the comptonization scenario involves another important effect which artificially reduces the disk radius : the disk photons are `` lost '' from the ` diskbb ` component into the dominant comptonized continua . in estimating the true disk radius , to be denoted @xmath247 , we must take this effect into account , knowing that comptonization conserves the photon number @xcite .",
    "practically , @xmath247 can be derived by quadratically summing @xmath111 of ` diskbb ` , @xmath116 of ` comppsh ` , and @xmath116 of ` comppss ` as @xmath248 then , equations   ( [ eq : lseed ] ) , ( [ eq : lraw ] ) , and ( [ eq : rtot ] ) readily yield the total luminosity @xmath249 of the cool disk as @xmath250 from the values in table  [ tbl : parameters ] for the time - averaged spectrum , we obtain @xmath251 km , which is equivalent to @xmath252 for @xmath253 .",
    "the implications are that roughly half the disk area is directly visible , and the disk inner radius is factor 3 larger than in the high / soft state .",
    "although the estimated value of @xmath247 may still be relatively small compared with the original idea of disk truncation , it can be subject to yet additional uncertainties which take part in when transforming the raw ` diskbb ` normalization into a physical radius .",
    "the stress - free inner boundary condition is probably appropriate for a thin disk extending down to the last stable orbit .",
    "in contrast , a truncated disk may have continuously rising stress to its inner radius .",
    "similarly , the environment of the disk is different between the two states : in the lhs , the disk is likely to be more strongly heated by irradiation and conduction from the hot cloud .",
    "therefore , the color hardening factor in the lhs may well be significantly larger than the value of 1.7 employed in equation  ( [ eq : rin2rin ] ) ; then , the true effective temperature would be lower , and hence @xmath111 would become still larger .",
    "three independent pieces of evidence further argue against the small disk radius in the lhs .",
    "one is the relatively small values of reflection , @xmath106 , which requires the cool seed disk not to intrude too deeply into the hot corona . to reconcile the small values of @xmath124 with a configuration wherein",
    "the seed disk is nearly completely surrounded by the corona , we would have to invoke , e.g. , mild relativistic coronal outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we already argued against it ( subsection  [ subsec:1655_cyg ] ) .",
    "second , the intrinsic width of the fe - k line , when interpreted as relativistic broadening in the disk near the bh , can constrain the innermost locations of the cool disk . for this purpose ,",
    "we re - fitted the average spectra with the final model , but with the gaussian replaced by so - called ` diskline ` model @xcite . when fixing the inclination at @xmath254 , and assuming the line emissivity to scale as @xmath84",
    ", the fit constrained the rest - frame line center energy as @xmath255 kev , and the innermost disk radius for the fe - k line production as @xmath256 which is fully consistent with the value of @xmath247 derived above .",
    "finally , as quoted in subsection  [ subsec : diffspec ] , @xcite studied fast variations of cyg x-1 in the fe - k line energy region , and argued the cool reprocessor to be located farther than @xmath257 for @xmath253 .",
    "although the implied radius is much larger than considered here , this should be taken as another evidence supporting the disk truncation .",
    "( incidentally , the present results on the fast variability in the fe - k lines and the compton humps constrain their production sites to be closer than @xmath258 . )",
    "based on these examinations , we estimate that the cool - disk radius of cyg x-1 during the present lhs observation is @xmath259 km nominally , but is subject to rather large uncertainties , and is likely to be considerably larger than this .",
    "all the considerations presented here will also apply to previous lhs studies , where the small inner disk radius derived from simple continuum fits was used to challenge the truncated disk model @xcite . in short , the small disk radii claimed for some bhbs in the lhs would need a careful revision .",
    "the remaining issue is how to interpret our results on the time variation , summarized in subsection  [ subsec : sec4summary ] and subsection  [ subsec : summary_of_analysis ] . in a standard accretion disk which we believe is approximately correct in the present case ,",
    "the disk parameters are mutually related as @xmath260 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath261 is the mass accretion rate .",
    "since @xmath74 has been confirmed to change little as cyg x-1 varies , the variation must also keep @xmath247 and @xmath261 approximately constant .",
    "( an alternative case , namely , positively correlated changes in @xmath247 and @xmath261 , would be unlikely , because an increase in @xmath262 would enhance radiative cooling , and hence _ reduce _ @xmath247 ; @xcite . ) as a result , the total disk luminosity @xmath249 , defined by equation  ( [ eq : ldisk ] ) , should also be kept rather constant .",
    "however , @xmath176 has been found to increase from lp to hp ( subsection  [ subsec : hilo_comppsfits ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath180 must decrease in hp by 2030% . as confirmed in subsections [ subsec : hilo_comppsfits ] and [ subsec : diffspec ] ,",
    "the data permit ( though do not require ) such a decrease in @xmath180 from lp to hp .    based on the above arguments",
    ", we presume that cyg x-1 gets brighter as a larger fraction of the disk photons are intercepted by the comptonizing corona , while the underlying cool disk itself is kept essentially unchanged .",
    "this will cause an increase in @xmath176 , and the associated decrease in @xmath180 .",
    "although this inference does not necessarily specify how the corona is actually changing , we may consider one possible scenario below .",
    "let us , for example , assume that the compton cloud has a rather spherical shape , or a thick torus geometry , with its outer radius located at @xmath263 km where the free - fall time is @xmath264 s. ( the actual in - fall time scale of the corona may well be longer , depending on the viscosity . ) based on our discussion made in subsection  [ subsec : diskpara ] , the cool disk is considered to partially protrude into the corona , but truncated at , say , @xmath265 .",
    "the comptonization will then take place both in the overlapping region ( between @xmath247 and @xmath266 ) , and inside @xmath247 , of the corona .",
    "the corona is assumed to be rather turbulent with strong density inhomogeneities , so that we need two optical depths , @xmath267 and @xmath268 , to express its effects .",
    "furthermore , we expect @xmath269 to increase as the corona falls toward the bh , for the following two reasons .",
    "one is because , compared to the corona inside @xmath111 , that in the overlapping region must be more strongly cooled by the disk photons , and less efficiently heated by protons due to lower densities .",
    "the other is because , at about @xmath270 , the disk surface layer must evaporate into the corona , so it will take a fraction of a second ( calculated at @xmath266 ; @xcite ) for the evaporated electrons to be heated by protons via coulomb interaction .",
    "then , the observed @xmath271 kev should be considered as a radial average over the corona .    under the configuration",
    "as assumed above , we further speculate that , for some unspecified reasons , the corona has a number of `` holes '' ( at least in the overlapping region between the disk and corona ) , through which the disk is directly visible ( subsection  [ subsec : bepposax ] ) . with these , the spectral composition of cyg x-1 ( and of gro  j1655@xmath640 ) can be explained at least semi - quantitatively .",
    "furthermore , this scenario can explain why the directly visible disk and the fe - k lines of gro  j1655@xmath640 are weaker than those of cyg x-1 beyond what is expected by the inclination difference , because the holes would act as a vertical collimator to direct these disk - related emission components toward pole - on directions .",
    "the disk reflection would also be affected , but thier intrinsically broad shape would remain rather intact .    in order to explain the fast variability , we may assume that the opening fraction of the coronal holes vary with time , due to some fluctuations in the disk evaporation rate .",
    "as the hole area diminishes by an increased evaporation , we expect @xmath176 to increase and @xmath180 to decrease , as observed in the changes from lp to hp .",
    "since the incremented portion of the corona must initially have a lower electron temperature due to the finite ion vs. electron coupling time , the hp spectrum is expected to be less comptonized than in lp , again as observed .",
    "electrons in that portion of the corona will be gradually heated up , on time scales of a fraction of a second , as they fall inwards across @xmath247 .",
    "this will explain , at least qualitatively , the xis to pin phase lag which would be too large to be explained by time - of - flight delays of photons in the compton process .",
    "through the detailed analysis of the suzaku data of cyg x-1 , we have obtained the following firm results .    1 .",
    "the 0.7400 kev suzaku spectra are reproduced by a sum of a cool disk emission , two compton continua both with reflection ( @xmath106 ) , and a mildly broad fe - k line .",
    "2 .   the two compton continua , with @xmath214 and @xmath4 , can be described by a common temperature of @xmath105 kev , although the data do not exclude them having different temperatures .",
    "the disk is characterized by @xmath272 kev and @xmath273 km ( @xmath274 ) .",
    "roughly half the disk emission gets comptonized , while the rest forms the spectral soft excess .",
    "when cyg x-1 brightens up on a time scale of 1200 s , a larger fraction of disk photons becomes comptonized , although the disk parameters remain unchanged .",
    "the spectrum softens , as a result of a decrease in either @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "a comparison between cyg x-1 ( with @xmath16 ) and gro  j1655@xmath640 ( with @xmath17 ) supports the view that the disk has a flat geometry and the compton cloud is more spherical .    combining these results with some theoretical considerations , we propose the following speculative scenario on the lhs of cyg x-1 ( and possibly of other bhbs ) .",
    "that is , the componizing corona , with a roughly spherical ( or thick torus ) geometry , extends up to , say , @xmath257 , and the cool disk protrudes half way into it .",
    "the corona is highly inhomogeneous ( as required by the double compton @xmath73 ) , and has openings ( as required by the soft excess ) to allow a direct view of part of the disk .",
    "the hard x - ray intensity increases when the opening area of the corona decreases and hence a larger number of disk photons become comptonized .",

    "<S> the black - hole binary cygnus x-1 was observed for 17 ks with the suzaku x - ray observatory in 2005 october , while it was in a low / hard state with a 0.7300 kev luminosity of @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the xis and hxd spectra , spanning 0.7400 kev , were reproduced successfully incorporating a cool accretion disk and a hot comptonizing corona . </S>",
    "<S> the corona is characterized by an electron temperature of @xmath2 kev , and two optical depths of @xmath3 and @xmath4 which account for the harder and softer continua , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the disk has the innermost temperature of @xmath5 kev , and is though to protrude half way into the corona . </S>",
    "<S> the disk not only provides seed photons to the compton cloud , but also produces a soft spectral excess , a mild reflection hump , and a weakly broadened iron line . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the suzaku data on gro  j1655@xmath640 reveals several interesting spectral differences , which can mostly be attributed to inclination effects assuming that the disk has a flat geometry while the corona is grossly spherical . </S>",
    "<S> an intensity - sorted spectroscopy indicates that the continuum becomes less comptonized when the source flares up on times scales of 1200 s , while the underlying disk remains unchanged . </S>"
