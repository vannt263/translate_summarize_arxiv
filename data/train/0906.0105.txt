    "electron spin resonance ( esr ; sometimes called electron paramagnetic resonance or epr ) provides a powerful means for the investigation of low - energy magnetic excitations in numerous magnetic substances .",
    "it is widely accepted in the high - field esr community that despite of high resolution and sensitivity , the application range of commercially available esr spectrometers ( with the highest frequency of @xmath60.1 thz and magnetic fields up to 6 t ) appears considerably limited .",
    "the use of such one - frequency spectrometers becomes rather inefficient when studying magnetic systems with a large zero - field splitting , complex frequency - field diagrams of magnetic excitations or materials with field - dependent esr parameters ( @xmath7-factor , line - width , etc . ) .",
    "multi - frequency esr techniques employing several frequencies and combined with high magnetic fields allows for more detailed esr studies of such systems .",
    "this kind of esr spectroscopy has a broad range of applications in solid - state physics , material science , and chemistry ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "esr spectroscopy is based on the detection of resonance absorption of electromagnetic radiation corresponding to transitions between electron - spin energy levels split by internal effects ( crystal - field anisotropy , exchange interactions , etc . ) and/or by an applied magnetic field .",
    "the strength of such interactions in magnetic materials can vary from tens of millikelvin to hundreds and even thousands of kelvin ( which corresponds to a frequency range from tens of mhz to hundreds of thz ) .",
    "that is why extending the frequency range of esr techniques beyond 1 thz appears to be one of the central issues in modern esr spectroscopy .    due to the lack of intensive sources of electromagnetic radiation the frequency range between 300 ghz and 10 thz",
    "is known as  thz gap \" .",
    "it is important to mention that the output power of conventional sources of monochromatic submillimeter - wavelength radiation used for high - frequency esr ( such as backward wave oscillators , bwos @xcite , gunn - diodes , and millimeterwave vector network analyzers @xcite ) significantly drops approaching the thz frequency range ( down to some hundreds and even tens of @xmath0w ) .",
    "it imposes serious restrictions for esr in this frequency range .",
    "employment of submillimeter wave molecular - gas lasers ( pumped by a tunable co@xmath4 laser ) and quantum - cascade lasers ( qcl ) in combination with high magnetic fields has been proven a useful technique for studying the cyclotron resonance in semiconductors . on the other hand , a rather discrete spectrum of radiation produced by molecular - gas lasers ( which is limited for each gas or mixture of gases ) , and the relatively narrow frequency range of qcls significantly reduces the use of these radiation sources , when frequency tunability is required .",
    "that is why the application of free - electron lasers ( fel ) as powerful radiation sources , tunable over a large frequency range , appears to be very promising .",
    "the first attempt to combine fel and pulsed magnetic fields was made using the felix radiation source at rijnhuizen @xcite .",
    "although the idea of employing fels as thz radiation sources in esr spectroscopy seems , at the first glance , very straightforward , it has remained questionable whether a sufficiently high resolution required for most esr applications ( at least better than 1@xmath1 ) can be achieved .",
    "it is worth to mention that in contrast to radiation produced by conventional sources ( for instance , gunn - diodes ) used for continuous - wave ( cw ) esr spectroscopy , the radiation produced by fels has a pulse structure , with a typical pulse duration of the order of microseconds ( in case of electrostatic , or van de graaf , accelerator ) or picoseconds ( linear accelerator , hereafter linac ) . due to",
    "the bandwidth - limited ( or sometimes called fourier - limited ) pulse nature , the fel radiation is not ideally monochromatic - particularly in case of linac - based fels .",
    "furthermore , the fel pulse power can reach hundreds of kw/@xmath8 , which might lead to a number of parasitic effects , including for instance overheating of the sample and even its destruction as result of ionization defects .",
    "effects of optical bleaching under the influence of high - power fel radiation were reported for inas / gasb @xcite and inas / al@xmath9ga@xmath10sb @xcite structures , opening new opportunities in the so - called saturation spectroscopy @xcite but , on the other hand , demonstrating a potential problem when employing high - power pulsed radiation produced by fels for the conventional `` low - power '' spectroscopy .    here , we report on the successful application of the linac - based fel at the research center dresden - rossendorf ( forschungszentrum dresden - rossendorf , fzd ) as a tunable source of thz radiation for high - field esr .",
    "the spectrometer operates in the quasi - cw mode and allows for esr experiments in the wavelength range of 4 - 250 @xmath0 m ( which corresponds to 1.2 - 75 thz or 40 - 2500 @xmath11 in frequency , and 5 - 310 mev in energy ) in pulsed magnetic fields up to 70 t with a spectral resolution better than 1@xmath1 .",

    "an overview of fel - based thz - radiation sources at the fzd is presented .",
    "section iii describes the pulsed - field user facilities at the dresden high magnetic field laboratory ( hochfeld - magnetlabor dresden , hld ) used for high - field esr spectroscopy . in section iv , the description of the fel - based spectrometer is given . in conclusion , we discuss further potential of fel spectroscopy , including those in high magnetic fields .",

    "the possibility to operate in the cw regime is one of the most important advantages of felbe at the fzd .",
    "this regime is of particular importance for pulsed - field esr ( with a typical magnetic field - pulse duration from 10 ms to some hundreds of ms ) , allowing to avoid complex problems of synchronization of fel radiation and magnetic - field pulses , permitting longer acquisition times and thus better signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "complex artificial optical structures ( metamaterials ) , exhibiting unusual optical properties ( for instance , negative refraction index ) can be the subject of the fel spectroscopy as well .",
    "fel pump - probe techniques @xcite in high magnetic fields look very attractive and challenging ( particular in pulsed fields ) at the same time .",
    "due to the high radiation power , the fel light can be used for the investigation of numerous non - linear effects in solids : higher - order harmonic generation , above - threshold ionization , ponderomotive potential effects , etc .",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "finally , due to the extraordinary high brightness and tunability , fel can be successfully used as an optical source for scattering scanning near - field optical microscopy and spectroscopy @xcite .",
