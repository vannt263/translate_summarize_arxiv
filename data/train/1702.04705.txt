    "the goal of this paper is to study symplectic aspects of monodromy map for second order linear equation on a riemann surface of genus @xmath1 with meromorphic potential admitting @xmath2 simple zeros .",
    "our results generalize results of the recent paper by m.bertola , c.norton and the author @xcite where the case of holomorphic potential was treated in detail ( see also an earlier paper by s.kawai for another approach to this problem @xcite ) .",
    "the condition of coordinate invariance of the equation @xmath3 on a riemann surface @xmath4 of genus @xmath1 implies that the function @xmath5 transforms as a projective connection under a coordinate change while the solution @xmath6 locally transforms as @xmath7-differential @xcite .",
    "thus any meromorphic potential @xmath8 with simple poles can be represented as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a fixed holomorphic projective connection on @xmath4 and @xmath11 is a meromorphic quadratic differential with @xmath2 simple poles .",
    "this is a parameterization of the space of meromorphic potentials on a given riemann surface is natural since meromorphic quadratic differentials with @xmath2 simple poles form the cotangent space @xmath0 to moduli space of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 with @xmath2 marked points .",
    "however , there remains a freedom in the choice of the `` base '' holomorphic projective connection @xmath10 for a given riemann surface . in this paper , following @xcite we assume that @xmath10 holomorphically depends on moduli of @xmath4 ( in particular , this requirements rules out the use of fuchsian projective connection as @xmath10 ) .",
    "furthermore , following @xcite we choose @xmath10 to be the bergman projective connection @xmath12 ( up to the factor @xmath13 this projective connection is the zeroth order term in the expansion of the canonical normalized meromorphic bidifferential @xmath14 near the diagonal @xmath15 @xcite ; @xmath16 is the prime - form ) .",
    "therefore , we are going to study the equation written in the form ",

    "the ratio @xmath17 of two linearly independent solutions of ( [ sint ] ) solves the schwarzian equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary local parameter on @xmath4 and @xmath20 denotes schwarzian derivative .",
    "the schwarzian equation determines a @xmath21 monodromy representation of the fundamental group @xmath22 which turns out to be liftable to an @xmath23 representation @xcite ( the lift to an @xmath24 representation is a non - trivial fact due to spinorial nature of solutions @xmath25 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we define an @xmath23 monodromy representation of equation ( [ sint ] ) directly , by an appropriate change of dependent variable @xmath6 .",
    "denote the standard generators of the fundamental group by @xmath26 ; these generators obey the relation @xmath27 .",
    "since all poles @xmath28 of the potential of equation ( [ sint ] ) are simple then both eigenvalues of monodromy matrices @xmath29 equal to @xmath30 for each @xmath31 ; all other monodromies are @xmath32 matrices satisfying certain genericity conditions @xcite .",
    "our goal is to study symplectic properties of the monodromy map for equation ( [ sint ] ) .",
    "since monodromy matrices depend on the choice of normalization point of solutions of ( [ sint ] ) it is natural to work with the corresponding character variety which we denote by @xmath33 ; a point of @xmath33 is an equivalence class of monodromy representations which differ by a simultaneous conjugation with the same matrix .",
    "the index @xmath34 indicates that the monodromies around poles @xmath35 are not generic : all of their eigenvalues are equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the main result of this paper states that the canonical poisson structure on @xmath0 implies the goldman bracket on the character variety @xmath36 under the monodromy map of equation ( [ sint ] ) , therefore generalizing the result of @xcite to potentials with simple poles .",
    "moreover , similar to @xcite and @xcite , we prove that the same statement holds for equation ( [ sint ] ) where the bergman base projective connection is replaced either by schottky or quasi - fuchsian ( bers ) projective connection .",
    "we follow the same strategy as in @xcite ; it is based on the use of the `` abelian periods '' of the quadratic differential @xmath11 as coordinates on the underlying moduli space @xmath0 .",
    "these coordinates are periods of the abelian differential @xmath37 on the canonical covering @xmath38 of @xmath4 ( the genus of @xmath38 equals @xmath39 ) .",
    "we call them `` abelian periods '' or simply `` periods '' to distinguish from monodromy matrices of equation ( [ sint ] ) which are also called sometimes `` periods of quadratic differentials '' @xcite ; following the terminology of @xcite the monodromy matrices should probably be rather called `` non - abelian periods '' . in the theory of dynamical systems",
    "the abelian periods of the quadratic differential @xmath11 are known under the name of `` homological coordinates '' ( see @xcite and numerous recent papers ; a substantial reference list can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the phase space associated to equation ( [ sint ] ) is the space of pairs ( riemann surface @xmath4 of genus @xmath1 , meromorphic quadratic differential @xmath11 on @xmath4 with @xmath2 simple poles ) .",
    "this phase space is nothing but the cotangent bundle @xmath0 ( up to subspaces of codimension one and higher ; these subspaces contain differentials with multiple zeros ) .",
    "the natural symplectic structure on @xmath0 is defined by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are local coordinates on the moduli space @xmath42 while @xmath43 are corresponding momenta ( coefficients in the decomposition of a cotangent vector in the basis @xmath44 ) .",
    "the set of holomorphic local coordinates @xmath45 on @xmath42 can be chosen as follows . to determine locally the conformal structure of @xmath4 we pick ( outside of hyperelliptic locus and for @xmath46 ) a set of @xmath47 entries of the period matrix @xmath48 of @xmath4 ; in different neighbourhoods of the moduli space these entries might have to be chosen differently .",
    "the quadratic differentials corresponding to cotangent vectors @xmath49 are products @xmath50 of normalized holomorphic differentials .",
    "an additional set of @xmath2 coordinates which determine the positions of punctures @xmath51 on @xmath4 we choose to be @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 form a pair of normalized holomorphic 1-forms on @xmath4 corresponding to some torelli marking ( these coordinates are also local : in different coordinate charts on @xmath42 one might need to choose another pair of normalized holomorphic differentials and/or different torelli markings ) .",
    "the quadratic differential corresponding to cotangent vector @xmath55 is the meromorphic quadratic differential ( given by the formula ( [ qk ] ) below ) whose only simple pole is at @xmath56 .",
    "the momenta @xmath43 are then defined to be coefficients of decomposition of an arbitrary meromorphic quadratic differential with simple poles in the basis described above .    an alternative set of darboux coordinates on @xmath0 ( more precisely , on the subset @xmath57 which contains quadratic differentials with all simple zeros ) is given by abelian periods of the quadratic differential @xmath11 which are defined as integrals of @xmath37 over odd part of homology group @xmath58 of canonical covering @xmath38 .",
    "the canonical two - sheeted covering @xmath38 is defined by equation @xmath59 in @xmath60 ; the branch points of @xmath38 lie at zeros and poles of @xmath11 ( in modern literature @xmath38 is sometimes attributed to seiberg - witten @xcite or hitchin @xcite , although this two - sheeted covering was extensively used starting from early days of teichmller theory @xcite ) .",
    "the genus of @xmath38 equals @xmath39 ; it admits a natural holomorphic involution which we denote by @xmath61 .",
    "the homology group @xmath58 can be decomposed into direct sum @xmath62 of even and odd subspaces under the action of @xmath61 ; the dimension of @xmath63 equals @xmath64 while @xmath65 . choosing a symplectic basis @xmath66 in @xmath67 with the intersection matrix @xmath68 we define periods of @xmath11 by a_i=_a_i^-v,0.7 cm b_i=_b_i^-v .",
    "the intersection pairing in @xmath67 defines the natural symplectic form @xmath69 which turns out to coincide with the canonical symplectic form @xmath70 on @xmath71 restricted to the space of quadratic differentials with simple zeros .",
    "moreover , we show that the function generating the transformation from canonical darboux coordinates @xmath72 to darboux coordinates given by periods @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 which generalizes the formula obtained in @xcite to the case @xmath75 .    the symplectic form @xmath76 induces a poisson structure on the character variety @xmath33 via the monodromy map of equation ( [ sint ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this monodromy map essentially depends on the choice of the base projective connection .",
    "the choice of bergman projective connection @xmath12 as the base is not unique since @xmath12 transforms non - trivially under the change of torelli marking of @xmath4 .",
    "the bers projective connection chosen as the base in @xcite carries even more freedom , since it depends on a choice of a point in the teichmller space as a parameter . nevertheless , as it was shown in @xcite , the poisson structure induced on the character variety is the same for the bergman projective connection ( independently of torelli marking used ) and bers projective connection used in @xcite ( independently of the choice of the initial point in the teichmller space ) .    technically , it is convenient to work with the matrix first order equation constructed by introducing functions @xmath77 where @xmath25 are two linearly independent solutions of ( [ sint ] ) .",

    "notice that the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 in ( [ lsi ] ) are ( holomorphic and meromorphic respectively ) differentials on @xmath38 , not on @xmath4 itself .    the poisson bracket between @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( assuming that the coordinates @xmath88 and @xmath89 are independent of moduli ) is given by the following expression : \\{u(z ) , u ( ) } = _z-  _ , where the bimeromorphic function @xmath90 on @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 ; the differential operator @xmath93 is known as the `` lenard s operator '' in the theory of integrable systems .    the computation of the poisson bracket ( [ pbpot ] ) from the fundamental poisson bracket @xmath94 ( and , therefore , also from fundamental poisson bracket on @xmath0 ) is based on variational formulas for the canonical bidifferential @xmath95 proved in @xcite . the monodromy map for equation ( [ lsi ] )",
    "gives an @xmath23 representation of @xmath96 .",
    "a technical computation originally performed in @xcite allows to find the poisson bracket between traces of monodromy matrices of equation ( [ lsi ] ) along two arbitrary loops @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "denote the moduli space of meromorphic quadratic differentials on riemann surface of genus @xmath1 with @xmath2 simple poles and @xmath103 simple zeros by @xmath104 .",
    "here we list a few basic facts about the canonical covering of a riemann surface determined by any quadratic differential @xmath105 .",

    "the bidifferential @xmath116 is symmetric , @xmath117 and its only singularity is on the diagonal : as @xmath118 in a local coordinate @xmath19 one has b(x , y)=(+ s_b((x))+ ",

    "the projective connection @xmath12 is important both in physics ( it equals to the @xmath123-component of the energy - momentum tensor of free bosons on a riemann surface @xcite ) and in mathematics ( it describes variations of a holomorphic section of determinant of hodge vector bundle over various moduli spaces @xcite , and also variations of the determinant of laplacian on a riemann surface @xcite ) .",
