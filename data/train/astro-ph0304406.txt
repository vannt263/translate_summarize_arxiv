    "the giant molecular cloud complex sgr  b2  is one of the most interesting regions in the galaxy . located close to the galactic centre",
    ", the complex is undergoing extensive star formation and hosts a myriad of large molecules , many of which have not been detected elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "most of the complex organic molecules found here are confined to a compact ( size @xmath4  pc ) region called the large molecular heimat ( lmh ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is in keeping with models of the formation of complex molecules , according to which these molecules are either directly formed on the surfaces of dust grains or are formed from seed molecules which are themselves formed on grain surfaces ( e.g. @xcite ) . when these dust grains are heated ( typically by radiation from hot stars that form in molecular cloud cores ) , the grain mantles evaporate , releasing the molecules in gaseous form .",
    "further , in time dependent astro - chemical models , these molecules are rapidly destroyed either by photodissociation or by collisions with other molecules . as a result , complex organic molecules are generally found only in hot molecular cloud cores .",
    "recently , however , there have been indications that some large organic molecules are more wide - spread in the sgr  b2   cloud than was hitherto believed .",
    "a comparison of the measured flux density from single dish and interferometric observations of the millimetre wavelength emission from glycolaldehyde suggests that the molecule is distributed over a region at least @xmath5  pc in size ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , no direct images of its spatial distribution are available . similarly , emission studies of ethanol towards selected regions around sgr  b2   indicate that it too is likely to be wide - spread in this region , but again , no direct images are available for this molecule ( @xcite ) .",
    "we present here wide field giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) images of the 1065  mhz @xmath0 1@xmath1  k transition of acetaldehyde ( @xcite ) towards sgr  b2 ; this transition was originally detected towards sgr  b2  by gottleib ( 1973 ) , using a single dish telescope .",
    "acetaldehyde is one of the molecules whose interstellar production mechanism is presently quite unclear , placing strong constraints on models of interstellar chemistry .",
    "it has been found so far in both cold dust clouds as well as in hot cores ( @xcite ) . towards the galactic centre ,",
    "it has been detected at mm wavelengths in sgr  b2(n ) ( @xcite ) , along with its isomers vinyl alcohol and ethylene oxide ( @xcite ) .",
    "interferometric observations of the 1065  mhz transition were not possible until very recently , as there were no telescopes equipped with receivers at this frequency .",
    "the newly comissioned gmrt does operate at this frequency , however , and , unlike millimetre - wave interferometers , provides both a ( relatively ) large field of view as well as high spatial resolution .",
    "our images show direct evidence for the presence of acetaldehyde over a large region in sgr  b2 .",
    "the gmrt ( @xcite ) observations were carried out on 12 may 2001 , during the commissioning phase of the telescope .",
    "the array has a hybrid configuration with 14 of its 30 antennas located in a central compact array with size @xmath6 1 km ( @xmath6 3.5 k@xmath7 at 1065  mhz ) and the remaining antennas distributed in a roughly `` y '' shaped configuration , giving a maximum baseline length of @xmath6 25  km ( @xmath6 90 k@xmath7 at 1065  mhz ) .",
    "the baselines between antennas in the central array are similar in length to those of the `` d '' array of the vla while the baselines between the arm antennas are comparable to those of the vla `` b '' array .",
    "an observing bandwidth of 1  mhz ( @xmath8  km / s ) was used for the ch@xmath2cho   observations , centered at 1065.075  mhz , the line rest frequency ( @xcite ) .",
    "the band was divided into 128 spectral channels , giving a channel spacing of @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the standard calibrators 3c286 and 3c48 were observed at the start and end of the run respectively in order to set the absolute flux density scale and also to determine the bandpass shape , while the compact source 1751@xmath11253 was used for phase calibration .",
    "the total on - source time was @xmath12  hours .",
    "in a later , short observing run , the system temperature was measured towards the calibrators as well as the source by firing noise diodes .",
    "the data were converted from the raw telescope format into fits and then analyzed in aips .",
    "after editing the obviously bad data , the flux density scale and instrumental phase were calibrated using standard aips procedures .",
    "care was also taken to account for the fact that the system temperature in the direction of sgr  b2   is higher than that towards the flux or phase calibrators ( due to the wide - spread continuum emission from the environs of sgr  b2  and its proximity to the galactic centre ) .",
    "after the initial calibration , a continuum image was made using the line - free channels and used to self - calibrate the u - v visibilities .",
    "this was carried out in an iterative manner until the quality of the image was found to not improve on further self - calibration .",
    "the continuum emission was then subtracted from the multi - channel u - v data set and the continuum - subtracted data mapped in all channels ; any residual continuum was then subtracted in the image plane by fitting a linear baseline to line - free regions .",
    "the hybrid configuration of the gmrt array implies that a single gmrt observation yields information on both small and large angular scales .",
    "image cubes were therefore made at various ( u , v ) ranges and analysed separately .",
    "the low resolution images ( such as fig .",
    "[ fig : uv10ov ] ) were deconvolved using the standard clean deconvolution algorithm to produce the final spectral cube . however , at the highest resolutions ( such as that of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv60m0 ] ) , the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) is too low and the emission too diffuse for the clean algorithm to work reliably ; this image has hence not been deconvolved . despite this",
    ", the low snr of this image implies that the inability to deconvolve it does not greatly degrade its dynamic range or fidelity ; the morphology of the emission should hence be accurately traced , apart from an uncertainty in the scaling factor ( this essentially arises because the main effect of deconvolving weak emission at about the noise level corresponds to multiplying by a scale factor ; @xcite ) .",
    "-0.2 in      ch@xmath2cho  emission was detected from sgr  b2 over the lsr velocity range @xmath13  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "[ fig : uv10ov ] shows the integrated emission from this entire velocity range ( contours ) overlaid on the continuum emission at 1065  mhz ( grey scale ) .",
    "we detect emission from the regions sgr  b2   north ( n ) , main ( m ) and south ( s ) , as well as from a location @xmath14 to the south of sgr  b2  ( n ) ( which is labelled aa in fig .  [",
    "fig : uv10ov ] after mehringer et al .",
    "the spectra of these regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uv10spc ] ) show a systematic velocity gradient in the north - south direction , with sgr  b2  ( n ) showing emission up to an lsr velocity of @xmath15  km  s@xmath10  and sgr  b2  ( aa ) having emission centered at @xmath16  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "a similar gradient is seen in several molecular species associated with sgr  b2 , e.g. hc@xmath17n and ch@xmath17cn ( @xcite ) and h@xmath18co ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we do not detect any ch@xmath2cho  emission towards sgr  b1 , although it lies within our field of view and our observing frequency band is sufficiently wide to include any emission associated with it .    the other noteworthy feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv10ov ] is that the line emission is confined to regions with continuum emission .",
    "this implies that either the ch@xmath2cho  emission is mased or that the gas which produces the ch@xmath2cho  emission is closely associated with that producing the radio continuum .",
    "however , the velocities of the ch@xmath2cho   emission match those of the formaldehyde ( h@xmath18co ) absorption in the different regions ( @xcite ) , showing that the ch@xmath2cho   emitting clouds lie in front of the hii regions which are the source of the radio continuum . in the absence of masing , this would require fine - tuning of physical conditions to ensure the excitation of gas only in clouds in front of the continuum sources ( the parent gas cloud , as traced by the ch@xmath17cn and hc@xmath17n emission , is more extended than the region showing ch@xmath2cho  emission ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed line to continuum ratio in all four regions is @xmath19 , consistent with the ch@xmath2cho   emission being weakly mased ( the continuum flux densities of the regions over which the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv10spc ] were extracted are listed in the figure caption ) .",
    "note , however , that the continuum emission in sgr  b2   is considerably more extended than the line emission ( and hence more resolved out in our interferometric observations ) ; the measured line to continuum ratios in our maps are thus _ upper limits _ on the true line to continuum ratios .",
    "our conclusion that the observed emission is mased is consistent with that of fourikis et al .",
    "( 1974 ) , who found that the relative intensities of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 lines could only be explained if the former line is weakly mased .    fig .",
    "[ fig : uv60m0 ] is a high resolution ( @xmath22 ) image of the velocity integrated ch@xmath2cho   emission .",
    "sgr  b2  ( aa ) is not detected at this high resolution .",
    "the emission correlates very well with the high resolution images of 4.8  ghz formaldehyde absorption ( @xcite ) , the 6.7  ghz methanol absorption ( @xcite ) and the quasi - thermal 44  ghz methanol emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also overlaps with the star forming ridge recently detected via emission from vibrationally excited hc@xmath2n in sgr  b2  ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ fig : uv10ov ] shows clearly that , unlike most other large organic molecules , ch@xmath2cho   is wide - spread in sgr  b2 .",
    "the angular extent of the emission is , in fact , reasonably close to that assumed by fourikis et al .",
    "( 1974 ) in their computation of the excitation temperature and column density of ch@xmath2cho .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath21 transition of ch@xmath2cho   observed by fourikis et al .",
    "( 1974 ) is thermalized and has an excitation temperature of @xmath23  k , we can use their eqn .",
    "( 3 ) to obtain a ch@xmath2cho   column density of @xmath24  @xmath25 in the @xmath26 level . on the other hand ,",
    "the column density in the 1@xmath27 level of h@xmath18co is @xmath28 @xmath25 ( @xcite ) . for reasonable values of the h@xmath18co @xmath29 excitation temperature ( i.e. few k ) , and under the further assumption that the abundance ratio obtained from these two levels",
    "is representative of the actual abundance ratio of the molecules , the ratio of the molecular column densities is n(h@xmath18co)/n(ch@xmath2cho ) @xmath5 .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the ratio of @xmath30 expected from pure gas phase models for the production of these molecules ( @xcite ) and suggests that grain chemistry is probably important for the production of ch@xmath2cho .",
    "the enhanced wide - spread abundance of ch@xmath2cho   is probably related to the presence of numerous shocks in sgr  b2 , for which there are several independent lines of evidence .",
    "( 1 ) sato et al .",
    "( 2000 ) postulate a large - scale shock resulting from a cloud - cloud collision .",
    "evidence for such a collision comes from large - scale co maps as well as the presence of various molecular line masers ( e.g. ch@xmath2oh , h@xmath18co ; @xcite ) and distorted magnetic fields ( @xcite ) , all of which are aligned approximately north - south , broadly coincident with the ch@xmath2cho  emission of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv10ov ] .",
    "further , the eastern edge of the northern section and the western edge of the southern section of the ch@xmath2cho  emission seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv10ov ] lie along the boundary of this postulated cloud - cloud collission .",
    "( 2 ) mehringer & menten ( 1997 ) argue that the quasi - thermal 44  ghz methanol emission ( which is spatially correlated with the ch@xmath2cho  emission ) probably arises from shocked gas at the boundaries of expanding ionized shells around the young stars in the molecular cloud .",
    "( 3 ) martn - pintado et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have found a large number of hot expanding shells produced by massive evolved stars in the region between sgr  b2  ( m ) and sgr  b2  ( aa ) , from which we detect bright ch@xmath2cho   emission .",
    "again , the expansion of these hot shells into the parent molecular cloud is likely to result in the formation of shocks .",
    "thus , shocks do appear to be present at a number of locations in sgr  b2 .",
    "these shocks can cause the disruption of the grain mantles on which organic molecules have been formed and thus result in the release of these molecules into the gas phase . this could account for the observed wide - spread emission from ch@xmath2cho .    in time - dependent astro - chemical models ,",
    "the abundance of complex molecules released from grain mantles rapidly decreases with time , due to their destruction via uv photons or collisions ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the non - detection of acetaldehyde towards sgr  b1 ( which is believed to be considerably older than sgr  b2 ; @xcite ) is thus consistent with models in which this molecule is produced by the ( possibly shock - induced ) disruption of grain mantles .",
    "we note , however , that the mechanism for inverting the populations of the ch@xmath2cho  @xmath31 and @xmath32 levels is currently unknown ; it is thus also possible that ch@xmath2cho   is present in sgr  b1 , but that physical conditions here are not appropriate to excite the 1065  mhz transition .",
    "new interferometers , such as the gmrt , which can yield wide field images of molecular emission , now make it possible to obtain a clearer view of the large - scale distribution of complex organic molecules in the galaxy .",
    "these observations would not have been possible without the many years of dedicated effort put in by the gmrt staff in order to build the telescope .",
    "the gmrt is operated by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
