    "in 1960 , ivor robinson and i studied a class of solutions of einstein s equations on a lorentzian manifold , foliated by a shearfree , non - rotating and diverging congruence of null geodesics .",
    "we were surprised to find that , in the coordinate system we were using , the vanishing of the ricci tensor implied that two components of the metric tensor satisfied cauchy - riemann equations @xcite .",
    "since that time i have been interested in the question how and why complex numbers and structures appear in physical problems .",
    "complex numbers have been used in physics so much and for so long that one is taking them , most of the time , for granted .",
    "their origin is in ` pure ' mathematics : they appeared , in the xvith century , in connection with solving polynomial equations .",
    "they were used in solutions of physical problems , such as reflection and diffraction of waves , early in the xix century .",
    "complex roots of polynomial equations often appear in physical problems in connection with linear differential equations with constant coefficients .",
    "an early , ingenious use of complex analytic functions was made by arnold sommerfeld in his rigorous solution of the problem of diffraction of waves on a half - plane @xcite .",
    "roger penrose , in his twistor theory , put forward convincing arguments in favor of the relevance of holomorphic structures for fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "his methods and ideas have been successfully used in a variety of mathematical and physical problems .",
    "complex numbers and analytic functions permeate now all of quantum physics .",
    "complex numbers are introduced in physical theories in several ways ; it is not obvious that ` all the square roots of @xmath0 are the same ' .",
    "there is the @xmath1 of quantum mechanics that is ` universal ' in the sense that it appears irrespective of the details of the model under consideration .",
    "chiral ( weyl , reduced ) spinors in minkowski space - time are also complex , but this property reflects the signature of its metric tensor .",
    "dirac spinors can be restricted to be real , provided one uses a metric of signature @xmath2 ; but to write the wave equation of an electron , in any signature , one has to introduce complex numbers because electromagnetism is a gauge theory with @xmath3 as the structure group .",
    "the ` electromagnetic ' @xmath1 seems to have a quantum - theoretical origin : in the classical theory of a particle of charge @xmath4 the potential @xmath5 appears in expressions such as @xmath6 ; in quantum theory this becomes @xmath7 and the @xmath8 next to @xmath9 reflects the nature of the lie algebra of @xmath10 .    in this article , i present some thoughts on the origin of the appearance of complex numbers in physics , emphasizing the geometric , rather than the analytic , aspects of the problem . after recalling the notion of complex structures in real vector spaces ( section [ amt : cs ] ) ,",
    "i show , on a simple example , how such structures may be considered to appear in quantum mechanics ( section [ amt : qm ] ) . for some signatures of the metric tensor",
    ", clifford - hodge - khler duality introduces complex structures in spaces of spinors and multivectors ( section [ amt : chk ] ) .",
    "charge conjugation is also closely related to the appearance of complex numbers in quantum theory ; its generalization to higher dimensions is described in section [ amt : chconj ] . in a final section , influenced by my collaboration with w. kopczyski , p. nurowski and j. tafel",
    ", i describe the geometry underlying shearfree congruences of null geodesics , its relation to cauchy - riemann structures in three dimensions , and the close analogy between optical geometries in lorentzian manifolds and hermitian geometries in proper riemannian manifolds .    in 1961 ,",
    "engelbert schucking and i spent some time together at syracuse university in peter bergmann s group that included also dick arnowitt , asim barut , art komar , ted newman , roger penrose , ivor robinson , ralph schiller and mel schwartz . since that time",
    ", i have had the pleasure to see engelbert on various occasions and to talk with him on many issues of science and life .",
    "these discussions included also the topics touched upon in this text .",
    "on one of my visits to new york , engelbert presented me with a copy of @xcite , an excellent account of the history of number systems .",
