    "the process of building a more complete understanding of the dwarf galaxy luminosity function in the local group has been an important activity over the last decade . motivated in great part by the seeming discrepancy between the predicted slope of the dark matter subhalo mass function and the apparently flatter slope of the dwarf galaxy luminosity ( or velocity dispersion ) function ( @xcite , @xcite ;",
    "see e.g. , @xcite or @xcite for discussion of relevant considerations for resolving this apparent discrepancy ) , dwarf galaxy searches using modern survey datasets have multiplied significantly the number of known local group galaxies . around the milky way , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) has been the key dataset ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". around m31 , the bulk of the new dwarf discoveries have come from dedicated surveys with the isaac newton telescope @xcite and the canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite .",
    "these surveys have obtained deep observations over a significant fraction of the area within @xmath6150 kpc of andromeda .",
    "in addition to these dedicated surveys , two satellites of andromeda have been found in an early sdss imaging scan targeting andromeda ( and ix and x , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of this letter is to report the discovery of a new dwarf spheroidal galaxy , andromeda xxix in area recently released by the sdss in their data release 8 ( dr8 , * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss dr8 includes imaging coverage of @xmath7 deg@xmath8 in the south galactic cap , allowing access to nearly half of the area within @xmath9 ( @xmath10 projected kpc ) of andromeda , extending the radial range over which dwarf galaxies can be discovered . while the sdss is substantially shallower than the dedicated m31 surveys , it is deep enough to enable discovery of dwarf galaxies down to luminosities of @xmath11 ( see @xcite for discussion of and xxviii , a slightly brighter and more compact galaxy discovered in the sdss dr8 ) .",

    "alternative tracers commonly used for detecting dwarf galaxies around the milky way , such as the horizontal branch or the main sequence turn - off , are much too faint to be detected .    to search for dwarf galaxies in the sdss we compute star counts in @xmath29 bins , selecting only stars with @xmath30 , colors roughly similar to metal - poor giant branch stars .",
    "overdensities are readily apparent upon visual inspection of the resulting map as `` hot pixels '' , typically with counts of 1015 objects ( stars and unresolved galaxies ) as compared to the background of 13 objects per bin . with this technique , we were able to detect many known dwarf companions of m31 ( e.g. , and i , ii , iii , ix , xxii , lgs3 , pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , most of the detected overdensities were galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift , which have similar colors and contain many spatially - unresolved member galaxies . visual inspection of the sdss image along with the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is sufficient to reject the majority of the false - positives .",
    "andromeda xxix appeared as a marginally significant detection , and deep follow - up data were obtained through director s discretionary time ( proposal i d gn-2011a - dd-6 ) at gemini north , with the gemini north telescope multi - object spectrograph ( gmos - n ; @xcite ) .",
    "images in @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands were taken at two dither positions , for a total exposure time of 500 seconds in each band .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard gemini pipeline in iraf , including de - bias and flat fielding using twilight flats .",
    "the fwhm is @xmath33 in each band , and the data are calibrated to @xmath34mag accuracy through cross - calibration with sdss stars between 18th and 20th magnitude ( in the band of interest ) in the gemini field . the @xmath31-band image of and xxix is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] , and the properties of and xxix are summarized in table  [ properties_table ] .",
    "the cmd of stars ( as measured by daophot ; @xcite ; crosses ) from the gmos - n imaging of the region within 1.5 half light radii of and xxix is shown in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] , and that of stars more distant from and xxix drawn from a similar area in the center panel ( corrected for galactic foreground extinction following @xcite ) .",
    "the left - hand panel clearly shows the upper part of the rgb of and xxix , and the center panel shows a much weaker but clear rgb ( owing to the relatively small field size of gmos  the dwarf extends to the edge of the image , but with much reduced stellar density ) superimposed on a reasonable approximation to the expected fore- and background contamination in the left panel . in the left - hand panel ,",
    "gray diamonds show sdss colors and magnitudes of stars within 2@xmath35 of and xxix .",
    "the sdss data show a very wide color spread , with objects spread across the color range @xmath36 , and a higher concentration at @xmath37 , unlike the narrow rgb seen in the gemini data .",
    "this is the result of photometric error of the sdss at such faint levels ( at @xmath38 , we have estimated the photometric error of the sdss using repeat imaging of sdss stripe 82 , demonstrating uncertainties @xmath39mag and",
    "@xmath40mag ; @xcite ) .    given that the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) is the only observable feature in the cmd of and xxix , and that the trgb has a roughly constant absolute magnitude in metal - poor stellar systems @xcite of @xmath41 , we have used it to estimate the distance to and xxix .",
    "such a method is commonly applied to dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but suffers from the disadvantage that the luminous part of the rgb can be very poorly populated owing to the small number of stars in many of the new dwarf discoveries ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a particularly clear example of this problem ) .",
    "we used the maximum - likelihood estimator described in @xcite , which modeled the trgb luminosity function as : @xmath42 this broken power - law form takes three parameters : @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the slopes of the luminosity function fainter and brighter than the trgb , while @xmath45 is the strength of the transition at the trgb .",
    "we adopted the values from @xcite of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . for the trgb",
    "fitting , the sdss photometry was converted to johnson @xmath49-band using the prescriptions of r.  lupton .",
    "we find that the likelihood is maximized at @xmath50 ( shown by the thick black horizontal line in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) , and a second , less likely ( by a factor of four ) peak also appears at @xmath51 ( in the gemini @xmath32-band @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively ) .",
    "the reason for this is clear : owing to the small number of rgb stars , there is a clump of stars with @xmath54 and a less populated gap , and the number of stars picks up again at @xmath55 .",
    "this gap is almost certainly the result of shot noise in the luminosity function of rgb stars , and we adopt a maximum - likelihood estimate of the distance modulus of @xmath56 ( @xmath57kpc ) , adding the uncertainty in the trgb magnitude of 0.12mag in quadrature @xcite .",
    "the two grey lines overlaid on the cmd of and xxix are the @xcite isochrones for [ fe / h]@xmath58 ( left ) and @xmath59 ( right ) , both with scaled solar abundance ratios ( the trgb colors depend on alpha enrichment at the @xmath60 mag level ) and 12gyr age , placed at a distance modulus of @xmath61 . and xxix shows a clear and well - defined rgb , clearly different from that of the outer regions of the and xxix gmos - n image .",
    "the fact that the isochrones match so well the observed cmd of and xxix argues that the distance modulus adopted in this letter for and xxix is not dramatically in error .    as a further check on the properties and estimated distance of and xxix , the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] shows the galactic foreground extinction - corrected cmd of stars in the draco dwarf spheroidal from @xcite , measured using the cfht megacam and color - corrected to the sdss system , shifted to the distance modulus of 24.32 , where we have assumed a distance modulus for draco of 19.59@xmath620.1 , following the rr - lyrae derived distances of @xcite and the compilation of @xcite .",
    "one can see that the cmd of and xxix ( including the trgb region ) is very similar to that of draco ( when distance offsets are accounted for ) . from this similarity",
    "we suggest that and xxix has a metallicity similar to that of draco with [ fe / h]@xmath3 dex ( adopting this metallicity from @xcite ) . furthermore , given the similarity between and xxix and draco s cmds , and that there are no blue luminous stars , such as are in the leo t dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we feel comfortable to classify and xxix as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy .    the projected angle between and xxix and m31 is 15.14 degrees , corresponding to a projected distance of 205kpc ( assuming m31 s distance of 785kpc as before ) .",
    "given the distance estimate for and xxix of @xmath63kpc , the three - dimensional distance of and xxix from m31 is quite well - determined to be 207@xmath20kpc , as and xxix is close to the point of closest approach to m31 along this line of sight ( the ` tangent point ' ) .    to estimate the luminosity of and xxix , we computed the luminosity function of rgb stars for and xxix within 1.5 half - light radii of the center of and xxix and compared this with the luminosity function of rgb stars in draco within 1.5 half - light radii , incorporating the distance uncertainties of draco and and xxix and shot noise in the star samples by using bootstrapping and monte carlo techniques .",
    "the rgb luminosity function appears to be best fit by scaling draco by a factor of 0.63@xmath64 , and assuming a luminosity of draco to be @xmath65 following @xcite , we infer a luminosity for and xxix of @xmath66 .",
    "we computed the radial profile of and xxix , along with the position , half - light radius , eccentricity , and position angle using the maximum likelihood technique described by @xcite , accounting for holes left by the halo of bright stars and galaxies .",
    "we used stars from the gmos - n imaging with @xmath67 and @xmath68 to determine these fit parameters .",
    "this method assumes an exponential profile for the dwarf galaxy and a constant background level .",
    "figure  [ profile_structure ] shows on the left maximum likelihood contours of the half - light radius , ellipticity ( @xmath69 ) , position angle ( @xmath70 ) , and number of detected stars in the overdensity ( @xmath71 ) , while the right side shows the radial profile fit .",
    "the structural parameters have one - dimensional 1-  , 2-  , and 3-@xmath72 confidence areas overlaid .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath73 and half - light semi - major axis of @xmath74 pc ( 1.7@xmath75 ) are typical of other local group dwarf galaxies at and xxix s absolute magnitude ( see fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , with a range between 200 and 500pc half - light radius for both m31 and milky way satellites with @xmath76 , and fig .  6 of @xcite ) .",
    "in this letter , we reported the discovery of a new dwarf galaxy , andromeda xxix , using data from the recently released sdss dr8 .",
    "the detection in the sdss data was marginal , and we confirmed the detection using deeper @xmath31 and @xmath32-band imaging data from the gmos instrument on gemini north .",
    "the gmos data show a clear rgb and no sign of other bluer luminous stars ; accordingly we argue that and xxix is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy , separated on the sky by a little more than 15 degrees from m31 .",
    "the distance modulus inferred from the trgb is @xmath16 , corresponding to a heliocentric distance of @xmath0kpc and a three - dimensional separation from m31 of @xmath1kpc ( close to m31 s virial radius ) .",
    "this separation is close to the distance at which dwarf spheroidal satellites start to become less common , giving way to dwarf irregular satellites ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "its absolute magnitude , as determined by comparison to the rgb luminosity function of the draco dwarf spheroidal , is @xmath2 . and xxix s stellar populations appear very similar to draco s ; consequently , we estimate a metallicity for and xxix of [ fe / h]@xmath3 .",
    "the half - light radius of and xxix is @xmath4pc and its ellipticity is @xmath5 , typical of dwarf satellites of the milky way and m31 at this absolute magnitude range .",
