    "wave propagation localized to a planar metal - dielectric interface has a long history ( zenneck , 1907 ; agranovich and mills , 1982 ; boardman , 1982 ; homola et al . , 1999 ;",
    "matveeva et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "in contrast , wave propagation localized to the planar interface of an isotropic dielectric material and a uniaxial dielectric material was found possible by dyakonov only in 1988 ( dyakonov , 1988 ; averkiev and dyakonov , 1990 ) . since then , researchers have explored surface - wave propagation ( swp ) on increasingly complex systems of bimaterial interfaces such as biaxial - isotropic , uniaxial - uniaxial , and biaxial - biaxial ( walker et al . , 1998 ; darinski 2001 , wong et al . , 2005 ; polo et al . , 2006 , 2007a , b ; nelatury et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "in all such investigations , essentially , one looks for the selected angular regimes of the propagation direction wherein certain dispersion conditions are met . for complex systems ,",
    "the angular regimes are very narrow and depend highly on the crystallographic symmetries of the two materials .",
    "our motivation for this paper is to show how one might exercise control on the angular regimes of swp .",
    "whereas temperature and pressure may be altered to control swp , the application of an external field is expected to provide dynamic control .",
    "in particular , the electro - optic effect refers to changes in optical properties by the application of a low - frequency or dc electric field .",
    "for instance , an optically isotropic crystal ( possessing either the @xmath0 or @xmath1 point group symmetry ) upon exposure to a dc electric field turns birefringent ( cook , 1996 ; lakhtakia , 2006a ) .",
    "the pockels effect is a linear electro - optic ( eo ) effect , whereby the modification of the inverse ( optical ) permittivity matrix by the dc electric field is quantified through 18 electro - optic coefficients , not all of which may be independent of each other , depending on the point group symmetry ( boyd , 1992 ) .",
    "the opportunities offered by the pockels effect for tuning the optical response characteristics of materials have recently been highlighted for photonic band - gap engineering ( lakhtakia , 2006b ; li et al .",
    ", 2007 ) and composite materials ( lakhtakia and mackay , 2007 ; mackay and lakhtakia , 2007 ) .",
    "these publications suggest that , although the changes in the optical permittivity matrix are typically small , the effect on swp could be significant due to the extreme sensitivity of surface waves on the dielectric constitutive properties .",
    "let us note here an earlier study wherein the quadratic eo effect named after kerr was shown to offer control over swp ( torner et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "this paper introduces the influence of the pockels effect on swp .",
    "although the theoretical treatment is general , numerical results are presented only for a specific eo material : potassium niobate ( zgonik et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 provides a description of a canonical boundary - value problem , the optical permittivity matrix of an eo crystal , and the derivation of the dispersion relations for swp . in section",
    "3 numerical results are furnished , and our conclusions are distilled in section 4 . a note on notation : vectors are underlined , matrixes are decorated with an overbar , and the cartesian unit vectors are denoted as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "all field quantities are assumed to have an @xmath5 time - dependence .",
    "let the plane of swp be a bimaterial interface .",
    "the half - space @xmath6 is filled with a homogeneous , isotropic , dielectric material with an optical refractive index denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the half - space @xmath8 is filled with a homogeneous , linear , eo material , whose optical relative permittivity matrix is stated as ( lakhtakia and reyes 2006a , b ) @xmath9 incorporating the pockels effect due to an arbitrarily oriented but uniform dc electric field @xmath10 , the matrix @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 -\\epsilon _ { 2}^{(0)}\\epsilon _ { 1}^{(0)}\\sum_{k=1}^3 r_{6k}e_{k}^{dc } & \\epsilon _ { 2}^{(0)}(1-\\epsilon _ { 2}^{(0)}\\sum_{k=1}^3 r_{2k}e_{k}^{dc } ) & -\\epsilon _",

    "when @xmath33 , the curves for all three orientations of the dc field and the zero dc field are similar , having nearly the same peak values of @xmath53 and peaking at close to the same values of @xmath7 . as @xmath30 increases , the curves become differentiated both in the @xmath53 peak height and its position on the @xmath7 axis . among the four values of @xmath30",
    "explored , the largest peak values of @xmath53 occur for @xmath52 .",
    "this is particularly true when @xmath49 ; then some values of @xmath53 are more than an order of magnitude larger than found at other values of @xmath30 .    , except that @xmath53 is plotted against @xmath7 .",

    "the influence of the pockels effect on swp at the interface between potassium niobate and an isotropic dielectric material has been demonstrated by our numerical studies . with the application of a dc electric field ,",
    "we have noted the shift in the @xmath7-range and the @xmath29-bands that permit swp .",
    "the greatest influence of the pockels effect is on the median propagation angle @xmath37 of the very narrow @xmath29-bands in which swp is possible .",
    "shifts of over @xmath34 at a fixed value of @xmath7 have been deduced .",
    "thus , the pockels effect can be pressed into service for an electrically controlled on - off switch for surface waves .    as of now",
    ", the existence of surface waves at the planar interface between a biaxial dielectric material and an isotropic dieletric material has not been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "the narrow @xmath29- and @xmath7-regimes for swp may discourage experimentalists from searching for surface waves in these scenarios .",
    "electrical control of swp direction may provide a convenient way to search for surface waves .",
    "the experiment could be carried out with a fixed geometry defining the propagation direction and the orientation of the linear eo material , and the signed magnitude of @xmath40 could then easily be swept electronically until a surface wave is detected .",
    "various experimental configurations for exciting surface waves are available ( agranovich and mills , 1982 ) , as also are optically transparent electrodes to apply dc electric fields ( minami 2005 ; medvedeva 2007 ) .",
