    "the susy n=1 kdv model is related to the following l - operator : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the chevalley generators of twisted affine lie superalgebra @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a superderivative , the variable @xmath7 lies on a cylinder of circumference @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a grassmann variable , @xmath10 is a bosonic superfield with the following poisson brackets : @xmath11 . making a gauge transformation of the l - operator",
    "we obtain a new superfield @xmath12 = @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 generate the superconformal algebra under the poisson brackets : @xmath16 the susy n=1 kdv system has an infinite number of conservation laws and the first nontrivial one gives the susy n=1 kdv equation : @xmath17 the integrals of motion are generated by the logarithm of the supertrace of the corresponding monodromy matrix , which has the following form : @xmath18 @xmath19 \\big).\\ ] ] its quantum generalization can be represented in the quantum p - exponential form ( for the explanation of this notion see below and @xcite for details ) : @xmath20 vertex operators @xmath21 are defined in the following way @xmath22 .",
    "the universal r - matrix with the lower borel subalgebra represented by @xmath23 is equal to @xmath24 . due to this fact @xmath25 satisfies the rtt - relation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 mean that the corresponding object is considered in some representation of @xmath29 .",
    "thus the supertraces of the monodromy matrix ( `` transfer matrices '' ) @xmath30 commute , providing the quantum integrability .",
    "it is very useful to consider the evaluation representations of @xmath29 , @xmath31 , where now the symbol @xmath27 means integer and half - integer numbers . denoting @xmath32 as @xmath33",
    "we find that @xmath34 commute : @xmath35=0.\\nonumber $ ] the expansion of @xmath36 in @xmath37 ( the transfer matrix in the fundamental 3-dimensional representation ) is believed to give us as coefficients the local i m , the quantum counterparts of the mentioned i m of susy @xmath38 kdv .",
    "using the super q - oscillator representations of the upper borel subalgebra of the quantum affine superalgebra @xmath39 we define the @xmath40 operators ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the transfer - matrices in different evaluation representations can be expressed in such a way : @xmath41 where @xmath27 runs over integer and half - integer nonnegative numbers .",
    "@xmath40 operators satisfy quantum super - wronskian relation : @xmath42 one should note , that we use only @xmath43-dimensional `` @xmath44-induced '' representations ( sometimes called atypical ) of @xmath45 .",
    "it allows , however , to construct the fusion relations , see below . to construct the relations like baxter s ones we introduce additional `` quarter''-operators , constructed `` by hands '' from the @xmath46-operators : @xmath47 for odd integer @xmath48 .",
    "the baxter s relations are : @xmath49 @xmath50 the fusion relations have the following form very similar to the @xmath51 case : @xmath52 but they are only `` fusion - like '' because the `` quarter''-operators do not seem to correspond to any representation of @xmath45 . the truncation of these relations for different values of @xmath53 , being the root of unity : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 has the following form : @xmath57 in the case when @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , @xmath60 there exists an additional number of truncations : @xmath61 @xmath62 these relations allow us to rewrite the fusion relation system in the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations of @xmath63 type .",
    "in this paper we studied algebraic relations arising from the integrable structure of cft provided by the susy @xmath64=1 kdv hierarchy .",
    "the construction of the @xmath46-operator as a `` transfer''-matrix corresponding to the infinite - dimensional q - oscillator representation could be also applied to the lattice models .",
    "the relations like baxter s and fusion ones will be also valid in the lattice case because they depend only on the decomposition properties of the representations . + in the following we also plan to study the quantization of @xmath65 susy kdv hierarchies , related with super - w conformal / topological integrable field theories .",

    "<S> it is related with the superconformal field theory because its poisson brackets give the virasoro algebra and the involutive family of integrals of motion ( i m ) providing the integrability of the conformal field theory ( cft ) . since the late 1980s </S>",
    "<S> the supersymmetric and fermionic extensions of the kdv system have been known ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , which in turn are related with superconformal field theory ( scft ) . during the following years they were extensively studied on both the classical and the quantum level . </S>",
