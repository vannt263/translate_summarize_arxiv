    "for terahertz quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) , two types of structures play a major role : the resonant - phonon ( rp ) and the bound - to - continuum ( btc ) design . in rp structures , efficient depletion of the lower laser level",
    "is achieved by tuning the corresponding transition to the longitudinal - optical ( lo ) phonon energy ( 36 mev in gaas ) . by contrast",
    ", btc designs are based on minibands , enhancing the influence of coulomb interactions in two ways .",
    "first , the close energetic spacing of the miniband levels favors electron - electron ( e - e ) over lo phonon scattering in the carrier transport .",
    "also , the large spatial extent of the minibands across many wells , together with the localization of the positively charged donors in typically a single well , leads to considerable conduction band bending due to space charge effects.@xcite thus , a careful modeling of coulomb interactions is necessary to analyze carrier transport in btc qcls , and here specifically the role of coulomb interactions in such structures .",
    "however , e - e scattering is much more computationally demanding than single - electron processes like electron - phonon interactions , hampering its inclusion in quantum mechanical simulations of qcls beyond the mean - field approximation.@xcite the numerical load is further increased by the large spatial extent of the minibands . due to its efficiency , the semiclassical ensemble monte - carlo ( emc ) method  is well - suited for investigating btc structures .",
    "however , emc simulations have up to now typically focused on terahertz rp structures,@xcite while only few results are available for equivalent btc or related chirped superlattice designs.@xcite    we present an emc simulation tool optimized for the simulation of terahertz btc structures .",
    "we employ a full many - subband ( ms ) screening model for electron - electron scattering and include the exchange effect for the parallel - spin collisions .",
    "space charge effects are adequately considered by performing iterative schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) and carrier transport simulations , yielding so - called self - self - consistent solutions.@xcite this tool allows us to properly assess the role of coulomb interactions for the carrier transport and gain in a typical terahertz btc design .",
    "widely - used approximations , such as non - iterative simulations , using simplified screening models , or neglecting the spin dependence of e - e scattering , usually work well for rp structures , but can lead to significant deviations for terahertz btc qcls , as shown in this paper .",
    "the simulation tool , consisting of a three - dimensional emc and an sp solver , allows for a self - consistent analysis of the carrier transport and optical gain in the qcl structure.@xcite the sp solver yields the subband eigenenergies and wave functions , needed as an input for the semiclassical emc carrier transport simulation .",
    "the obtained electron distribution in the structure gives rise to space charge effects , resulting in conduction band bending and altered subbands .",
    "thus , iterative runs of sp  and emc simulations are necessary to obtain convergence , corresponding to self - self - consistent solutions.@xcite    all essential scattering mechanisms are accounted for in the carrier transport simulation .",
    "included is elastic electron - impurity ( e - i ) and interface roughness scattering , as well as inelastic interactions of electrons with acoustic and longitudinal - optical ( lo ) phonons .",
    "nonequilibrium phonon effects are also taken into account.@xcite being evaluated as a two - electron process , e - e scattering assumes a special role in the emc simulation and has the highest computational complexity .",
    "its implementation is more closely discussed in section [ e_e ] . for all scattering processes , pauli",
    "s exclusion principle is taken into account.@xcite periodic boundary conditions are employed , i.e. , electrons leaving the device on one side are automatically injected into the equivalent subband on the opposite side.@xcite    coulomb interactions enter our simulation in the form of space charge effects as well as individual e - e and e - i scattering events . as discussed above , space charge effects and e - e scattering play an especially important role in thz btc structures due to the formation of minibands .",
    "thus , the implementation of these mechanisms will be discussed in detail in the following .",
    "the subband wave functions @xmath0 and eigenenergies @xmath1 for the simulated qcl structure are obtained by solving the sp system@xcite    [ sp]@xmath2    here , a position independent permittivity @xmath3 is assumed .",

    "the self - consistent potential is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the conduction band profile and @xmath12 is the electric potential due to the space charge profile . for qcls ,",
    "the subband energies and wave functions are typically computed for a single central period of the structure ; the subbands in other periods are then obtained by appropriate shifts of the solutions in energy and position .",
    "for the first run of the sp solver , a thermal occupation of the subbands according to fermi - dirac statistics is assumed.@xcite to obtain self - self - consistent solutions , the subband occupations are subsequently extracted from the emc analysis , which is carried out alternately with the sp  simulation until mutual convergence is obtained .      in the emc simulation , e - e scattering is implemented as a two - electron process.@xcite an electron in an initial state @xmath13 , i.e. , subband @xmath14 and in - plane wave vector @xmath15 , scatters to a final state @xmath16 , accompanied by a transition of a second electron from a state @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
