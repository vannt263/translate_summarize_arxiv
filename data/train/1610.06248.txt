    "it is shown that the limiting empirical measure of the zeros and critical points agree for these polynomials , yielding a version of theorem [ thm : pmk ] where the randomness can be reduced and independence still remains . however , as the following example shows , the randomness in theorem [ thm : pmk ] can not be completely eliminated ( i.e. , the theorem does not always hold for sequences of deterministic polynomials ) .",

    "the goal of this note is to describe the pairing between the root @xmath3 and the nearby critical point .",
    "more generally , we consider the case when several deterministic zeros are appended to the random polynomial @xmath0 and when @xmath2 is an arbitrary measure in the complex plane with compact support ( not just the uniform distribution on the unit circle ) .",

    "hanin s proof is guided by an intuitive electrostatic interpretation of the zeros and critical points .",
    "unlike the results in @xcite however , our results do not require the measure @xmath2 to have bounded density or require the deterministic roots to satisfy a separation condition .",
    "in addition , our methods are significantly different than those used in @xcite and allow us to describe the exact number of critical points lying in a region outside the support of @xmath2 . in a separate paper @xcite , hanin considers the joint distribution of roots and critical points for a class of gaussian random polynomials .",

    "finally , let us mention the work of dennis and hannay @xcite from the physics literature , which gives an electrostatic explanation for the pairing of critical points and zeros of random polynomials and characteristic polynomials of random matrices .      to begin , we first consider the analogue of theorem [ thm : pmk ] when @xmath64 deterministic zeros are appended to the random polynomial @xmath0 in .",

    "let us discuss the intuition behind theorem [ thm : genkabluchko ] .",
    "to do so , we must begin with theorem [ thm : pmk ] . roughly speaking , theorem",
    "[ thm : pmk ] describes the phenomenon that if @xmath0 is a degree @xmath1 random polynomial , then @xmath70 in probability as @xmath30 . in other words ,",
    "the limiting behavior of the critical points is the same as the limiting behavior of the roots . while theorem [ thm : pmk ] only applies to random polynomials with iid roots ,",
    "the same phenomenon has been observed for other ensembles of random polynomials @xcite , and numerical simulations show that it should be true for many other models .",
    "stated another way , the behavior in appears to be universal among random polynomials .",
    "let us now consider the polynomial @xmath0 from theorem [ thm : genkabluchko ] .",
    "it follows from the law of large numbers that @xmath71 weakly almost surely as @xmath30 since @xmath72 . therefore ,",
    "if the convergence in applies to the polynomial @xmath0 , the triangle inequality would immediately imply that @xmath61 also converges weakly to @xmath2 in probability .",
    "this heuristic is the basis for our proof of theorem [ thm : genkabluchko ] .",
    "the above heuristic also hints that the condition @xmath66 in theorem [ thm : genkabluchko ] is sharp . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath73 deterministic roots were to be appended , the limiting distribution is , in general , not @xmath2 as shown by the following example .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "define @xmath76 where @xmath38 are iid random variables uniformly distributed on the unit circle centered at the origin in the complex plane . then , by theorem [ thm : pmk ] , @xmath22 converges weakly to the uniform measure on the unit circle in probability as @xmath30 .",
    "however , the polynomial @xmath77 has at least @xmath78 critical points at the origin . in particular",
    ", @xmath79 for @xmath1 sufficiently large . among other things",
    ", this implies that @xmath80 does not converge weakly to the uniform probability measure on the unit circle as @xmath30 .",
    "while theorem [ thm : genkabluchko ] shows that the global behavior of the critical points is unchanged by the addition of @xmath64 deterministic roots , the addition of one or more deterministic roots can create a number of outlying critical points as illustrated in figures [ fig : iidcircdetout ] and [ fig : iidcirc3detout ] .",
    "one way of viewing this phenomenon is to view the deterministic roots as a small perturbation of the original polynomial .",
    "this small perturbation is not enough to change the global distribution of the critical points ; it may , however , as observed in the figures above , create a small number of outlying critical points .",
    "our main results below describe these outliers .      before we consider the perturbed model , we first consider the case when there are no deterministic roots . in this initial case ,",
    "we want to determine exactly where the critical points of the random polynomial @xmath0 , defined in , are located .",
    "this way , when we do append the small perturbation of deterministic roots , we will be able to tell exactly what effect the perturbation has had .",
