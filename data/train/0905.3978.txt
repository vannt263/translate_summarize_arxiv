    "one - dimensional quantum hamiltonians are very useful for modeling simple quantum systems . beside their ubiquitous importance in the study of transmission and tunneling experiments , numerous quantum systems in higher dimensions",
    "can be reduced to one - dimensional ones , due to symmetry ( for instance radial wave functions in a central potential ) or specific physical properties ( josephson junctions or edge states in the quantum hall effect are just two examples ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to examine one - dimensional scattering by a three - dimensional coulomb potential @xmath4 , starting from the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian @xmath5 , for an eigenstate @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the energy .",
    "@xmath12 corresponds to the repulsive potential , @xmath13 to the attractive one ; the boundary conditions will be specified later on .",
    "this is referred to as the _ one - dimensional coulomb potential problem_. although it has recently been studied@xcite , we find it useful to analyze it using somewhat different approach",
    ". as it turns out , there are some subtleties involved , which might affect some of the conclusions reached in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages encountered in the quantum coulomb problem is that the exact wave functions are computable . in three dimensions",
    ", it has been shown eighty years ago@xcite that the asymptotic behavior of the wave functions is somewhat distinct from that of plane waves .",

    "( [ schreqr ] ) has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) .",
    "the two basic solutions of eq .",
    "( [ schreqr ] ) are the regular one , satisfying @xmath22 , and the singular one , satisfying @xmath23 .",
    "the singular solution should be discarded : if not , for @xmath24 , the probability of finding the particle in a sphere of radius @xmath25 , @xmath26 becomes infinite for any @xmath25  ; for @xmath20 , the situation is more subtle , @xmath27 remains finite , but the radial current @xmath28 becomes nonzero , which is impossible for an @xmath21 state@xcite .",
    "a couple of difficulties arise when eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) is considered as compared with eq .",
    "( [ schreqr ] ) :    1 .",
    "the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) are required on @xmath29 , and not only on its positive part @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath31 is invariant under space inversion .",
    "2 .   the arguments used in the three - dimensional case to discard singular solutions of eq .  ( [ schreqr ] )",
    "are not valid@xcite for the original problem specified by eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) , and the imposition of scattering boundary conditions requires their inclusion as well .",
    "the standard techniques used for matching the wave function at @xmath3 require either the calculation of @xmath32 or of @xmath33 and both quantities diverge logarithmically when @xmath34 .",
    "one must then cope with ultraviolet divergences , which need to be regularized .",
    "these difficulties lead us to the _ connection problem _ , which can be defined as follows : let us decompose eq  .([schreqx ] ) into two equivalent coupled equations , one defined on @xmath30 with @xmath35 , the general solutions of which read    @xmath36    and the second defined on @xmath37 with @xmath38 , the general solutions of which read @xmath39    here , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are regular solutions , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 are singular solutions , defined on the appropriate domains ; the relations between @xmath44 and @xmath45 will be clarified later on .",
    "the connection problem consists in the calculation of the @xmath46 matrix expressing @xmath47 in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "since the derivative of the singular solution diverges at @xmath3 , it is impossible to match both @xmath49 and @xmath50 at @xmath3 .",
    "it is also not possible to use the method@xcite employed in a problem of scattering by a potential @xmath51 since the latter potential is integrable at @xmath3 , @xmath52 , whereas the coulomb potential is not .",
    "apparently , the connection problem can not be solved in terms of simple linear relations , and one needs to consider bilinear constraints ( an example of such a constraint is the current conservation @xmath53 around @xmath3 ) .",
    "our first task is to properly formulate and solve the scattering problem , corresponding to @xmath54 . to carry it out , we use two independent regularization methods .",
    "one is based on bilinear constraints , which can be formulated in such a way that ultraviolet divergences are canceled .",
    "the other method consists in calculating the exact transmission for a truncated coulomb potential @xmath55 , with @xmath56 for @xmath57 , @xmath58 for @xmath59 and letting @xmath34 . with both methods ,",
    "we arrive at the conclusion that the transmission coefficient vanishes , @xmath60 .",
    "the potential is perfectly reflective .",
    "moreover , this property of total reflection also holds for the attractive potential ( @xmath13 ) , whereas classically the reflection vanishes ; it is a novel manifestation of perfect _",
    "quantum reflection _ from an attractive potential .",
    "it is distinct from the standard example of quantum reflection from an infinite attractive square well : in the latter case , the divergence of @xmath61 is faster than logarithmic , and the corresponding spectrum is not bounded from below .",
    "our second goal is to calculate bound state energies and wave functions for an attractive potential ( @xmath13 ) ( the one - dimensional `` hydrogen atom '' problem ) .",
    "the ensuing discrete part of the spectrum ( @xmath62 ) appears to be rather intriguing , as it is composed of two interlacing spectra .",
    "the first one ( reported also in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the usual rydberg spectrum , with energies @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the corresponding wave functions are the _ regular _ solutions of the differential eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) .",
    "the energies of the second part of the spectrum are shifted from the first ones through @xmath65 , that is , @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the corresponding wave functions will be refereed to as _ anomalous _ states , and are constructed in terms of the singular solutions of eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) .",
    "these solutions are square integrable but not orthogonal",
    ". a proper incorporation of such states might require further insight into the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows : in section [ ii ] , we will first study the scattering problem , then explain , in section  [ iii ] , the two regularization methods used to solve the connection problem . the bound state problem will be analyzed in section  [ iv ] , where regular and anomalous states are introduced . finally , a short discussion of our results is carried in section  [ v ] .",
    "calculations requiring technical manipulations are collected in the appendices .",
    "for the scattering problem , we have @xmath54 in eq .  ( [ schreqx ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to recast eq .",
    "( [ schreqx ] ) so that all quantities are dimensionless .",
