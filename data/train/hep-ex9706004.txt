    "a non - zero magnetic moment of neutrino would be a fundamental physical quantity , whose implications could lead well beyond the standard picture of interactions of elementary particles and to non - standard phenomena in astrophysics .",
    "the recent renewed interest to the problem of the neutrino magnetic moment ( nmm ) is in a large part related to the peculiar behavior in time of the solar neutrino flux measured in the @xmath9 experiment@xmath10 .",
    "one interpretation of this behavior is that the measured flux anti - correlates in time with the solar activity@xmath11 .",
    "such an anti - correlation could be explained@xmath12 by interaction of nmm with the time - dependent magnetic field in the sun s convection zone . for the magnetic field in the convection zone in the range @xmath13 this mechanism",
    "is operative if the magnetic moment of the electron neutrino is @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the bohr magneton .",
    "such value of the nmm would be by several orders of magnitude bigger than the minimal standard model predicts for a massive neutrino@xmath16 : = 3 e g_f 8 ^2 m_3 10 ^ -19 _ b m_1 ev  .",
    "[ mstand ]    however in a number of extensions of the theory beyond the minimal standard model ( see e.g. @xcite ) one can readily achieve the nmm of the required magnitude , not necessarily related to the neutrino mass@xmath17 .",
    "the present direct laboratory limit for the nmm for electron antineutrino is derived from reactor neutrino experiments@xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "more stringent limits on nmm are found from astrophysical analyses@xmath20 .",
    "such analyses are typically based on the fact that at late stages of stellar evolution at densities above @xmath21 practically all energy loss by the star is due to neutrino emission .",
    "thus an nmm would add an electromagnetic component to neutrino interaction with matter inside the star and by that significantly modify : the overall rate of cooling , the critical mass of a he star , the duration and the energy spectrum of the neutrino burst from a supernova , etc .",
    "one should keep in mind however that though the astrophysical bounds are rather strong : @xmath22 , they still rely on model dependent assumptions@xmath23 .",
    "therefore it is still very relevant to improve the sensitivity of direct laboratory measurements of the nmm , presumably down to @xmath24 .",
    "a laboratory measurement of the nmm is based on its contribution to the ( anti)neutrino - electron scattering . for",
    "a non - zero nmm the differential over the kinetic energy @xmath25 of the recoil electron cross section @xmath26 is given by the sum of the standard weak interaction cross section ( w ) and the electromagnetic ( em ) one ( see equations ( [ sem ] ) and ( [ sw ] ) below ) . at a small recoil energy @xmath27 these two components behave in a distinctly different way : the weak part , @xmath28 , is practically constant , while the electromagnetic one , @xmath29 grows as @xmath30 towards low energies .",
    "therefore for improving the sensitivity to @xmath31 it is necessary to lower the threshold for detecting the recoil electrons as far as the background conditions allow . in the experiments @xcite the effective range of the detected energy of the electrons",
    "was @xmath32 because of a sharp increase of the background at lower energy .",
    "in the currently proposed experiments@xmath33 , the threshold for registration of the electrons is expected to be significantly lower : @xmath34 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that for experiments with the electron antineutrinos from a reactor a much better sensitivity to @xmath31 per mass of the detector can be achieved with a low background germanium spectrometer ( lbgs ) capable of setting the effectively measurable recoil energy range @xmath35 .",
    "similar spectrometers are being used for experiments with double beta decay and in search for weakly interacting dark matter .",
    "a detector of this type dedicated to the search for nmm is being constructed in itep and we report here on its thus far measured parameters .    in section 2",
    "we discuss general characteristics of @xmath2 spectrometers that make them suitable for low - background measurements , in particular for detecting rare events with total energy deposition below @xmath36 .",
    "as existing samples of analogous detectors we discuss the double beta decay and the dark matter detectors .    in section 3 and 4 is discussed the specifics of low - background measurements in a close proximity of a nuclear reactor .",
    "we evaluate the cosmic background conditions and background from inverse beta decay process with reactor antineutrino.we evaluate also the event rates from the reactor antineutrinos induced by the weak interactions as well as by their hypothetical electromagnetic interaction .",
    "based on these considerations we give reasoning for the chosen design of the spectrometer assembly and estimate its sensitivity to nmm .    in section 5",
    "we estimate the expected effect of the nmm in the spectrometer and compare it with the realistically achievable background .",
    "this allows to evaluate the possible limits of the sensitivity in the experiment to the nmm .    in section 6",
    "are described the design and the parameters of the built in itep spectrometer with active @xmath37 shielding .",
    "we report the results of tests of the spectrometer in a low - background laboratory in itep at the depth of 5 m.w.e .",
    "in detecting very rare events with the rate of less than one event per day extreme care should be taken with regards to the natural radioactivity background .",
    "this includes using in the construction of the detector highly purified materials , placing the experiment in special low - background chambers and applying appropriate selection criteria to the events .",
    "the advantage of using @xmath2 calorimeters in low - background measurements is partly based on their high energy resolution @xmath38 and for the most part on the availability of @xmath2 crystals of extreme purity : the fractions of radioactive impurities in the @xmath2 crystal are less than @xmath39 .",
    "a @xmath2 spectrometer can contain either one mono - crystal detector with mass up to 3 kg , or it can be an assembly of few such detectors with the total mass ( 8 - 15 ) kg . since the detectors are quite compact : the total volume usually does not exceed 4 l , it is possible to use in its shielding rare and expensive materials : refined electrolytic copper , highly purified titanium , crystallic silicon , old lead , which is practically free of the radioactive isotope @xmath40 . as an active shielding against the charged and the compton components of the background are used @xmath37 scintillators .",
    "these special measures allow to reach very low radiation background in the double beta decay and dark matter experiments .",
    "generally the background spectra of gamma detectors display a growth of the compton component of the background towards lower energies .",
    "this is caused by the character of the external radiation background and by the growth of the detection efficiency at lower energy of the gamma quanta . in @xmath2 detectors with the surface contact of the n type",
    "this growth of the background becomes slow at energies ( 150 - 200 ) kev and can turn into a decrease at lower energies .",
    "this is explained by the existence of a passive surface layer with thickness ( 0.5 - 1.5 ) mm in n - p detectors .",
    "in other words the @xmath2 crystal has its own passive shielding that absorbs soft external gamma radiation .    in the range of energies between 3 kev and 10 kev the main sources of the background",
    "are usually the microphonic and electronic noises .",
    "the microphonic noise is caused by vibrations of the detector including the vibrations induced by the boiling and the turbulent flow of the liquid nitrogen used as coolant for the detector .",
    "the sources of the electronic noise are the fluctuations of the detector leakage current and the thermal noise of the fet .",
    "the background from the microphonic and the electronic noises is very efficiently suppressed by the event pulse shape analysis@xmath41 .",
    "the remaining background at energies ( 2 - 100 ) kev is determined by the compton continuum and the elastic and inelastic scattering of neutrons on @xmath2 .",
    "the suppression of these components of the background to a great extent depends on the design of the spectrometer .",
    "the existing installations can be classified into two major types : those with a passive shielding ( ps ) and those with an active shielding ( as ) .",
    "an example of the first type of spectrometer is the installation built by the usc / pnl collaboration @xmath42 , where two @xmath2 detectors in copper cryostats are simply placed in a lead housing with 40 cm thick walls .",
    "however the construction of this spectrometer is based on the profound expertise of the pnl group in building low - background detectors using super pure materials . in this installation",
    "the inner 10 cm of the passive shielding is made of a very old lead from a sunken spanish galleon .",
    "major elements of the construction ( the cryostat , cold finger ) are manufactured from electrolytic copper . in the process of electrolysis from a @xmath43 solution",
    "the copper is purified chemically with high efficiency thus practically removing the contamination by @xmath44 admixtures and by cosmogenic elements produced by the cosmic rays . during the delivery to the underground site the time the components spent on the surface was minimized and also the delivery by airplane was excluded , since the rate of generation of the cosmogenic elements grows by orders of magnitude at high altitude . as a result after one year of conditioning of the spectrometer in the underground laboratory the usc / pnl spectrometer had produced then lowest achieved background count rate of 0.2 events/(kev kg year ) at the energy about 2 mev .",
    "an example of an as installation can be the sb / lbl spectrometer@xmath45 for the search for double beta decay of @xmath46 .",
    "the spectrometer is based on 8 @xmath2 detectors with the volume 160 - 180 @xmath47 each , surrounded by an active shielding consisting of 10 @xmath37 scintillator modules , which in turn is inside borated polyethylene surrounded by a 20-cm - thick @xmath48 shielding .",
    "the veto signals from the scintillators suppressed the cosmic background .",
    "the measurements were taken at the depth of 600 m.w.e . where the cosmic background was still significant .",
    "however the main purpose of the as was the suppression by a factor 10 - 20 of the compton component of the radiation background .",
    "thus the scintillator as makes the spectrometer less demanding with respect to purity of the passive shielding and of the rest of the components of the spectrometer .",
    "subsequently both spectrometers were used in the search for dark matter .",
    "this had required to lower the threshold down to 4 kev and to suppress the background at low energies . as a result",
    "the achieved rate of the background in the energy range ( 4 - 100 ) kev in the usc / pnl and sb / lbl spectrometers was respectively 0.1 events/(kev kg day ) and 0.4 events/(kev kg day ) .",
    "if it were possible to have such level of the background counts in a spectrometer located near a nuclear reactor , it would allow to significantly improve the sensitivity to the nmm in comparison with the present bounds@xmath18 from reactor experiments .",
    "however , at much smaller depth and near the reactor the background conditions are significantly worsened by two factors : a larger cosmic background and the background from the reactor itself .",
    "thus far there is no known experience of doing low - background measurements in such conditions , therefore a quantitative understanding of the influence of these sources of the background requires a separate study .",
    "the inherent background is practically the same in as and ps spectrometers .",
    "therefore the choice of the type of shielding of a lbgs depends on the ability to suppress the external background from the cosmic rays and from the working nuclear reactor .",
    "the resultant background is sensitive to a number of factors such as the exact position of the spectrometer relative to the reactor , the thickness of the layers of the passive and the active shielding and the order in which these layers are sandwitched , the presence in the spectrometer of materials containing hydrogen , etc .",
    "therefore our comparative estimates of the background and thus of an achievable sensitivity to the nmm in these two types of spectrometers are made under the following assumptions :    * the mass of the @xmath2 crystal is 2 kg ; * the mass of the passive lead shield is 10 t ; * the flux of the antineutrinos from the reactor at the detector is @xmath49 ; * the installation is located under the reactor at the depth of 20 m.w.e .",
    "; * the thermal neutron background is completely suppressed by the passive shield of the experimental pavilion ; * the time of experiment consists of 300 days of the reactor on time and 70 days of the reactor off time .    at a reactor site",
    "there is a possibility to place the spectrometer under the reactor , so that the whole reactor assembly provides a shielding from the cosmic background with effective thickness of 10 - 40 m.w.e . at the assumed here effective depth of 20 m.w.e .",
    "the hadronic component of the cosmic background is already very small , and thus background is dominated by the flux of muons . the counts due to passage of the muons through the spectrometer and their decay inside the spectrometer can be easily vetoed out .",
    "the most significant remaining source of the background is the muon capture in the shielding and in the detector itself due to the reaction@xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 .    in the capture process",
    "a new nucleus is produced and on the average 1.6 neutrons ( in @xmath48 ) with energy from 6 mev to few tens of mev .",
    "the muon capture and the interactions of the secondary neutrons and the gammas in the detector are separated in time and can not be vetoed by external counters .",
    "the rate of the muon capture events at 20 m.w.e .",
    "is 60 events / kg day@xmath53 .",
    "thus in 10 tons of a passive shielding there will be produced @xmath54 neutrons per day .",
    "the probability for these neutrons to get into the detector depends on the geometry of the installation and on the presence of a moderator and absorber layer between the the lead shield and the detector .",
    "the muon capture in the germanium crystal , through the reaction ( [ mucap ] ) produces gallium , whose isotopes undergo beta decay with the periods @xmath55 from 30 sec to 14 hours .",
    "the results of the estimates of the background from the @xmath56 capture and at 20 m.w.e . and of the inherent background of the detector in spectrometers with as and with ps are summarized in the table 1 .",
    "the total background count rate in the detector over the energy range 20 - 4000 kev is 0.01 events / sec , which is already 3 times better than the best up - to - date figure for a low - background detector at a small depth ( 15 m.w.e.@xmath57 ) .",
    "the total count rate of the @xmath58 counters when fully covered by the passive shielding is 240 pulse / sec .",
    "the efficiency of the suppression of the charged cosmic component in the energy range 10 - 50 mev is 99.91% , which is also the best figure achieved so far .",
    "all the observed lines from the decay of the elements in the @xmath44 sequence can be attributed to the presence in the installation of the radon 220 and 222 .",
    "an analysis of these data of the background measurements allows us to judge on the structure of the background at low energies",
    ". of the 10 events / hour observed in the range 100 - 200 kev 0.5 events / hour constitute the inherent radiation background of the spectrometer , 2.0 events / hour are contributed by the radon decay , 0.3 events / hour are attributed to the inefficiency of the veto system , finally , the dominant component of the background : 7 events / hour , comes from the secondary gamma quanta from the hadronic and muonic components of the cosmic background .",
    "these conclusions , derived from the observed spectrum , are also supported by the results of a simulation with the geant 3.213 program .",
    "the results of the measurements of the cosmogenic component of the background at the depth of 5 m.w.e .",
    "do not contradict the expected suppression at the depth of 20 m.w.e .",
    ", since at these depths the rate of the neutron production@xmath59 ( and thus of the gamma production ) by the cosmic rays differs by a factor of more than 20 .",
    "the study of the structure of the background is ongoing and more complete and detailed results will be presented elsewhere .",
