    "decoherence of a qubit coupled to an environment is studied with the central spin models .",
    "in addition to being a workhorse for understanding of quantum to classical transition @xcite , central spin models describe loss of qubit s coherence in nv centers in diamond @xcite , quantum dots in semiconductors @xcite , nmr experiments @xcite , etc .",
    "the environment , usually regarded as a destroyer of quantum coherence and entanglement , has been recently proposed to enhance sensitivity of a magnetometer based on the central spin system @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding how the environment influences qubit s state is central to quantum computing and metrology .",
    "so far , studies of decoherence focused mainly on systems prepared in schrdinger cat - like superpositions instantaneously coupled to an otherwise static environment described by time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "we consider instead a spin-1/2 system coupled to a driven environment .",
    "the environment undergoes a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) as it is driven through the quantum critical point by the change of the external field ( e.g. , a magnetic field in the ising chain depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "decoherence occurs because the environment `` monitors '' the system and `` finds out '' its pointer states ( i.e. , effectively classical states preserved in spite of decoherence @xcite ) .",
    "this means that each pointer state remains untouched , but makes a distinct imprint on the quantum state of the environment .",
    "how close to orthogonal are these record states determines how well the environment knows about the system .",
    "their overlap is the decoherence factor @xmath0 multiplying off - diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix of the qubit .",
    "effectiveness of decoherence depends on how easy it is to perturb ",
    "`` write on ''  the environment : its `` stiffness '' is determined by its hamiltonian as well as by its state . for the ising environment , hamiltonian - induced stiffness is due to either spin - spin interactions or the external field ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . when the two balance , the environment is at the critical point , where it is most susceptible to perturbations .",
    "decoherence is expected to be strongest there .",
    "this was already seen in _ static _ critical environments @xcite . in our system",
    "the environment is _ not _ static : it is driven across the phase transition , so its instantaneous state  and thus decoherence  is determined by both its hamiltonian and its history .",
    "we show that the latter profoundly affects qubit s decoherence rate .",
    "the aim of this paper is to understand how a driven critical environment affects decoherence of a qubit . for clarity of our discussion , which can be extended to more complicated systems",
    ", we consider an exactly solvable paradigmatic model of a qpt : the ising chain coupled to a central spin-1/2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we show analytically that decoherence is enhanced by the nonequilibrium transition and exhibit interesting dynamics characterized by the transition rate , coupling strengths and ground state fidelity .",
    "we also show that the time - dependent decoherence factor encodes both universal properties of the system associated with quantum criticality ( critical exponents ) and rich system - dependent ( non - universal ) features .",
    "our work combines theory of decoherence with rapidly growing fields of dynamics of qpts @xcite and quantum information @xcite . in the latter context",
    ", our study can be regarded as a dynamic generalization of the so - called fidelity approach to qpts @xcite .",

    "a qpt is characterized by vanishing excitation gap @xmath7 and divergent correlation length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the critical exponents , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants @xcite .",
    "there are two relevant time scales during a quench : the system reaction time given by @xmath13 and the time scale of change of the hamiltonian given by @xmath14 . away from the critical point",
    "the reaction time is short compared to quench time scale and so evolution is adiabatic .",
    "near the critical point opposite happens and evolution is approximately diabatic .",
    "the border between the two regimes lies at a distance @xmath15 from the critical point . equating the two timescales",
    ", we get @xmath16 kz theory also predicts that there is a non - equilibrium length scale @xmath17 imprinted onto the post - transition state of the system @xcite .",
    "it is given by the coherence length at the border between adiabatic and impulse regimes where the state of the many - body system freezes out : @xmath18 this scale yields e.g. a typical distance between topological defects created during a symmetry - breaking qpt .",

    "the calculations are similar as above with the only difference that slow driving through the critical point at @xmath120 excites momentum modes near @xmath124 rather then those close to @xmath92 .",
    "the small @xmath81 modes , excited during crossing the critical point at @xmath29 , are not affected by driving through the critical point at @xmath120 : ( [ uv_simplified ] ) - ( [ fk_quench ] ) hold for @xmath72 .",
    "the solutions ( [ uv_simplified ] ) and ( [ uv_simplified1 ] ) are valid again , but the expansion now requires @xmath180 because we need to substitute @xmath181 into @xmath182 . equations ( [ uv_prod ] ) and ( [ uv_prod1 ] ) are the same , but the phase @xmath183 and modified quench time scale @xmath184 have different expansions for @xmath23 and @xmath185 : @xmath186 and @xmath187 ."
