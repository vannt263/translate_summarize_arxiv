    "understanding the processes leading to the formation of stars is one of the fundamental challenges in astronomy and astrophysics . with the advent of new observational techniques and instruments , especially in the ir and radio wavebands ,",
    "a vast amount of astronomical data about star forming regions has been accumulated . however , on the theoretical side not much progress has yet been made .",
    "analytical models of the star formation process are restricted to describing the collapse of isolated , idealized objects ( for an overview see whitworth & summers 1985 ) .",
    "much the same applies to numerical studies ( e.g. bonnell & bastien 1993 , boss 1997 , burkert et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , nakajima & hanawa 1996 ) .",
    "star formation is a complex self - gravitating , magneto - hydrodynamical problem , which includes the effects of heating and cooling , and feedback processes from newly formed stars .",
    "furthermore , it is influenced by the galactic environment .",
    "taking into account all these processes with high spatial resolution exceeds by far present computational capabilities .",
    "previous numerical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of molecular cloud regions have shown that a large number of condensed objects can indeed form on a dynamical timescale as a result of gravitational fragmentation ( e.g.  larson 1978 , monaghan & lattanzio 1991 , keto et al .",
    "1991 ) . in these studies ,",
    "the clouds were treated as isolated gaseous spheres which collapsed completely onto themselves .",
    "instead , we study a small region embedded in a large , stable molecular cloud complex where only the overdense regions are able to contract due to self gravity .",
    "we assume the molecular cloud is supported on large scales by turbulence and/or other processes .",
    "previous numerical models were also strongly constrained by numerical resolution .",
    "larson ( 1978 ) , for example , used just 150 particles in an sph - like simulation .",
    "whitworth et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and turner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were the first who addressed star formation on larger scales in detail using high - resolution numerical models .",
    "however , they studied a different problem : fragmentation and star formation in the shocked interface of colliding molecular clumps .",
    "while clump - clump interactions are expected to be abundant in molecular clouds , the rapid formation of a whole star cluster requires gravitational collapse on a larger scale which contains many clumps and dense filaments .    in this letter , we extend previous studies of the collapse of isolated objects to the regime of the isothermal collapse and fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable _ region _ embedded in the interior of a molecular cloud . we present a high - resolution numerical model of the dynamical evolution and follow the fragmentation into dense protostellar cores . the temperature and the density",
    "is chosen such that the region is highly gravitationally unstable and forms a hierarchically - structured protostellar cluster .",
    "the results of this study , i.e. the properties of the dense clumps and of the newly formed protostellar cores are compared with observations .",
    "to follow the time evolution of the system , we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph : for a review see monaghan 1992 ) which is intrinsically lagrangian and can resolve very high density contrasts .",
    "the code is based on a version originally developed by benz ( 1990 ) .",
    "we adopt a standard description of artificial viscosity ( monaghan & gingold 1983 ) with the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the smoothing lengths are variable in space and time such that the number of neighbors for each particle remains at approximately fifty .",
    "the system is integrated in time using a second order runge - kutta - fehlberg scheme , allowing individual timesteps for each particle ( bate et al .",
    "once a highly - condensed object has formed in the center of a collapsing cloud fragment and has passed beyond a certain density , we substitute it by a ` sink ' particle which then continues to accrete material from its infalling gaseous envelope ( bate et al .",
    "1995 ) . by doing",
    "so we prevent the code time stepping from becoming prohibitively small .",
    "this procedure implies that we can not describe the evolution of gas inside such a sink particle .",
    "however , at some stage of the gravitational collapse the sph resolution limit ( bate & burkert 1997 ) would be reached in the fragment anyway . for a detailed description of the physical processes inside a protostellar core ,",
    "i.e. its further collapse and fragmentation , a new simulation just concentrating on this single object with the appropriate initial conditions taken from the larger scale simulation would be necessary ( burkert at al .",
    "1998 ) .    to achieve high computational speed ,",
    "we have combined sph with the special purpose hardware device grape ( sugimoto et al .",
    "1990 , ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1993 ) , following the implementation described by umemura et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and in greater detail by steinmetz ( 1996 ) . since we wish to describe a region in the interior of a globally - stable molecular cloud we have to prevent global collapse .",
    "therefore , we use periodic boundaries , applying the ewald ( 1921 ) method in an pm - like scheme ( klessen 1997 ) . in this letter",
    "we present a simulation with @xmath4 sph particles .",
    "the structure of molecular clouds is very complex , consisting of a hierarchy of clumps and filaments on all scales ( for a review see blitz 1993 ) .",
    "many attempts have been made to identify the clump structure and derive its properties ( stutzki & gsten 1990 , williams et al . 1994 ) .",
    "we choose as starting conditions density fields with gaussian random fluctuations that follow a power spectrum @xmath5 , i.e. large scale fluctuations have on average large amplitudes whereas the amplitudes of short wavelength modes decay quadratically .",
    "the fields are generated by applying the zeldovich ( 1970 ) approximation to an originally homogeneous gas distribution : we compute a hypothetical field of density fluctuations in fourier space and solve poisson s equation to obtain the corresponding self - consistent velocity field .",
    "these velocities are then used to advance the particles in one big step @xmath6 .",
    "1.2 cm    ( 12,9.5 ) ( 1.3 , 4.8)=6.7 cm ( 6.5 , 4.8)=6.7 cm ( 1.3 , 0.2)=6.7 cm ( 6.5 , 0.2)=6.7 cm ( 1.8 , 5.0 ) @xmath7 ( 7.0 , 5.0 ) @xmath8 ( 1.8 , 0.4 ) @xmath9 ( 7.0 , 0.4 ) @xmath10",
    "as a case study , we present the time evolution of a region in the interior of a molecular cloud containing a total mass of 222 jeans masses , determined from the temperature and mean density of the gas .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d - plots ] depicts snapshots of the system initially , and when 10 , 30 and 60 per cent of the gas mass has been accreted onto the protostellar cores .",
    "note that this cube has to be seen periodically replicated in all directions .",
    "initially , pressure smears out small - scale features , whereas large - scale fluctuations start to collapse on themselves , and into filaments and knots .",
    "after @xmath11 being defined by the start of the sph simulation . for adequate timing , the zeldovich shift interval @xmath12 has to be added . as reference",
    ", the free - fall time of the isolated cube would be @xmath13 .",
    "] , the first highly - condensed cores form in the centers of the most massive and densest jeans - unstable gas clumps and are replaced by sink particles .",
    "soon , clumps of lower initial mass and density follow , altogether creating a hierarchically - structured cluster of accreting protostellar cores .",
    "the gas is isothermal .",
    "hence , the calculations are scale free , depending only on one parameter : the dimensionless temperature @xmath14 , which is defined as the ratio between the internal . ] and gravitational energy of the gas .",
    "the model can thus be applied to star - forming regions with different physical properties . in the case of a dark cloud with mean density @xmath15@xmath16 and a temperature @xmath17k like taurus - auriga",
    ", the computation corresponds to a cube of length 10@xmath18pc and a total mass of @xmath19m@xmath20 ( with the jeans mass being @xmath21m@xmath20 ) .",
    "the dimensionless time unit corresponds to @xmath22yrs . for a high - density star - forming region like orion with @xmath23@xmath16",
    "these values scale to @xmath24pc and @xmath25m@xmath20 , respectively , again assuming @xmath26k .",
    "the jeans mass is @xmath27m@xmath20 and the time scale is @xmath28yrs .",
    "the location and time at which protostellar cores form , is determined by the dynamical evolution of their parental gas clouds . besides collapsing individually , clumps stream towards a common center of attraction where they merge with each other or undergo further fragmentation .",
    "the formation of dense cores in the centers of clumps depends strongly on the relation between the timescales for individual collapse , merging and sub - fragmentation .",
    "individual clumps may become jeans unstable and start to collapse to form a condensed core in their centers .",
    "while collapsing , these clumps also interact with each other .",
    "when clumps merge , the larger new clump continues to collapse , but contains now a _",
    "multiple _ system of cores in its center . now sharing a common environment ,",
    "these cores compete for the limited reservoir of gas in their surrounding ( see e.g. price & podsiadlowski 1995 , bonnell et al .",
    "furthermore , the `` protostellar '' cores interact gravitationally with each other . as in dense stellar clusters ,",
    "close encounters lead to the formation of unstable triple or higher order systems and alter the orbital parameters of the cluster members . as a result",
    ", a considerable fraction of `` protostellar '' cores get expelled from their parental clump .",
    "suddenly bereft of the massive gas inflow from their collapsing surrounding , they effectively stop accreting and their final mass is determined .",
    "ejected objects can travel quite far and resemble the weak line t tauri stars found via x - ray observation in the vicinities of star - forming molecular clouds ( e.g.  neuhuser et al .",
    "1995 , wichmann et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : accr - hist ] , we plot the accretion history for 14 representative protostellar cores in the simulation .",
    "the objects are numbered according to their time of formation .",
    "the figure illustrates the following trends : ( a ) the cores which form first tend to have the largest final masses .",
    "they emerge from the initial clumps with the highest densities .",
    "the collapse of these large initial clumps contributes a considerable fraction of their total mass .",
    "( b ) matter that contracts into dense cores at later times ( say @xmath29 ) has already undergone considerable dynamical evolution .",
    "small initial clumps stream towards each other along filaments . at the intersections of filaments they merge and may undergo rapid collapse , when enough mass is accumulated .",
    "( c ) once dense cores have formed , they evolve due to accretion , competing for gas from the surrounding reservoir and interacting dynamically , as described above . for example , at @xmath30 , core # 19 is expelled from a dense clump at the intersection of two massive filaments by a triple interaction with cores # 1 and # 17 .",
    "it stops accreting .",
    "however , it still is bound to the gas knot which grows in mass due to continuous infall .",
    "it falls back onto the clump of gas and resumes accreting at @xmath31 .",
    "cores # 9 and # 41 are also expelled from their parental clumps but , unlike core # 19 , their accretion is terminated completely .",
    "these dynamical interactions between cores are an important agent in shaping the mass distribution .",
    "figures  [ fig : mass - distr]a  d describe the mass distribution of identified gas clumps ( thin lines ) and of protostellar cores ( thick lines ) . to identify individual clumps we have developed an algorithm similar to the method described by williams et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , but based on the framework of sph . as a reference , we also plot the observed canonical form for the clump mass spectrum , @xmath0 ( blitz 1993 ) , which has a slope of @xmath32 when plotting @xmath1 versus @xmath33 .",
    "note that our initial condition does not exhibit a clear power law clump spectrum , but instead consists preferentially of small scale fluctuations .",
    "however , these are quickly damped by pressure forces and during the subsequent non - linear gravitational collapse a power - law mass spectrum is formed with a slope that is similar to the observed clump mass spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass - distr]b , c ) . in all panels ,",
    "the vertical lines indicate the sph resolution limit for @xmath34 particles ( bate & burkert 1997 ) .",
    "( 16,6.0 ) ( 1.75 , 3.10)=3.25 cm ( 5.00 , 3.10)=3.25 cm ( 1.75 , 0.50)=3.25 cm ( 5.00 , 0.50)=3.25 cm ( 9.75 , 0.50)=6.50 cm    a common feature in all our simulations is the broad mass spectrum of `` protostellar '' cores which peaks slightly above the overall _ jeans mass _ of the system .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , since the initial fluctuations span a vast range of masses and peak densities , and the evolution of each core is heavily influenced by complex merging and collapse processes .",
    "however , in a statistical sense , the system retains `` knowledge '' of its ( initial ) average properties .",
    "the present simulations can not resolve subfragmentation in condensed cores .",
    "however , detailed simulations show that perturbed cores tend to break up into multiple systems ( e.g.  burkert et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "here , we can only determine the mass function of multiple systems without breaking them down into a mass function of single stars .",
    "our simulations predict an initial mass function with a log - normal functional form , if the mass of a multiple system that forms within a condensed core is roughly proportional to the core mass , @xmath35 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass - distr]e compares the results of our calculations with the observed imf for multiple systems ( kroupa et al .  1990 ) .",
    "the maximum of the observed imf is located at @xmath36m@xmath20 .",
    "the calculated core mass distribution peaks at @xmath37 . in section  [ subsec : scaling ]",
    ", we found that when we scale the simulation to the conditions in low - density ( e.g.  taurus ) and high - density star - forming regions ( like orion ) , we obtain jeans masses of @xmath38m@xmath20 and @xmath27m@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "thus , to reproduce the observed peak in the imf , we take @xmath39 for taurus and @xmath40 for orion , i.e.  the implied star formation efficiency for a low - density taurus - like region is much lower than for cloud regions of high density like orion . with these star formation efficiencies , the agreement between the observed imf for multiple sytems ( thick dashed line ; values from kroupa et al .",
    "1990 ) is excellent .",
    "note that although the peak depends on our choice of @xmath41 , the agreement in the _ width _ of the distribution does not depend on this scaling . for comparison ,",
    "the imf corrected for binary stars ( kroupa et a.  1993 ) is indicated as thin solid line , together with the mass function from salpeter ( 1955 ) as thin dashed line .",
    "since collapse and fragmentation in molecular clouds is an extremely complex and dynamical process , many authors have sought to understand the stellar initial mass function as resulting from a sequence of statistical events which may naturally lead to a log - normal imf ( see e.g.  zinnecker 1984 , adams & fatuzzo 1996 ; also price & podsiadlowski 1995 , murray & lin 1996 , elemegreen 1997 ) . however , using numerical simulations , it is possible to identify underlying processes which may contribute to the form of the stellar initial mass function . in the calculations presented here , we find several trends .",
    "the `` protostellar '' cores that form first are generally formed in the clumps with the highest initial density , and tend to have the highest final masses .",
    "cores that form later , form from gas that was initially in low - density clumps or distributed gas which converged to form a higher - density clump before quickly collapsing .",
    "overlaid on these general trends , dynamical interactions between individual cores can act to terminate accretion on to a core by ejecting it from a clump , thus setting its final mass .",
    "the excellent agreement between the numerically - calculated mass function and the observed imf for multiple stellar systems ( kroupa et al .",
    "1990 ) strongly suggests that these gravitational fragmentation and accretion processes dominate the origin of stellar masses . in a subsequent paper ,",
    "the results from calculations spanning a larger range of the parameter space relevant for molecular clouds shall be discussed in detail .",
