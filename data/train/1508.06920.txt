    "<S> it is shown that specific combinations of bernoulli numbers attain the special values at their non - positive integers of the desingularized ones . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss twisted multiple zeta - functions , which can be continued to entire functions , and their special values at non - positive integer points can be explicitly calculated . + </S>"
