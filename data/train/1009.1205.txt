    "there are two urns , the left one containing @xmath1-balls and the right one having no ball .",
    "we shuffle the balls according to a rule as follows ; at each step one ball is chosen randomly and the ball is moved to the other urn chosen randomly .",
    "this process is called _ ehrenfest diffusion model_.    we consider a generalization of the above process by increasing the number of urns .",

    "there are @xmath6 distinct urns @xmath7 , initially @xmath8 contains distinct balls @xmath9 .",
    "let us consider a similar diffusion process as above : at each step , we choose a ball randomly and transfer the ball into one of the other urns .",
    "here we consider some kind of destinations of picked balls .",
    "the first one is any other urns without where it was ( section 3 ) .",
    "another two cases are considered in the appendix of this paper ; the second case is that a ball picked from @xmath10 is moved to @xmath11 ( appendix [ 32 ] ) .",
