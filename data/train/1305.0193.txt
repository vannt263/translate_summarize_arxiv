    "integrated photonics components such as waveguides @xcite , beam - splitters @xcite , slow - light devices @xcite , lenses @xcite and beam - shapers @xcite have received considerable attention in the last decade .",
    "these components can be manufactured using two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystals ( phcs ) .",
    "more specifically , phcs based on air holes in a planar waveguide based dielectric core have been successfully manufactured in silicon - on - insulator material using microfabrication techniques @xcite . prior to fabrication",
    ", a design step often involves selecting a number of geometric parameters related to the phc and performing optimization of a cost function over a large solution space .",
    "for instance , a basic photonic lattice can be defined and holes allowed to be present or absent , thereby enabling a binary encoding of the solution space .",
    "optimization may then be carried out using a standard genetic algorithm @xcite .",
    "this conference paper is concerned with the generation of arbitrary coherent beam profiles using engineered 2d phcs . in other terms , we seek to transform a known input beam into another beam of controlled amplitude _ and _ phase profile .",
    "those two conditions constitute a _ multiobjective optimization problem _ ( mop ) , which must be solved by sampling the set of optimal solutions , commonly known as the pareto set @xcite .",
    "the first part of this contribution briefly describes the optimization procedure for a specific target , namely the generation of coherent hermite - gauss beam profiles using a 2d phc slab . in the latter part",
    ", we describe the mop solving procedure used and present some solutions offering an acceptable trade - off between the two aforementioned objectives ( amplitude and phase profile of the beam ) .",
    "laser beam shaping is defined as redistributing the irradiance and phase of a beam @xcite .",
    "this contribution is concerned with finding a phc configuration which , when illuminated with a gaussian beam , produces a scattered wavefunction that matches a desired profile in a given plane .",
    "the beam shaping problem can be formulated as the minimization of the following integral @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the location of the target plane , @xmath2 is the computed em field on the target plane , @xmath3 is the desired beam at the device output ( the @xmath4axis is the beam propagation axis ) .",
    "it was recently proposed to solve this optimization problem using a combination of multiple scattering computations and a genetic algorithm .",
    "further details can be found in ref .",
    "however , the minimization of @xmath5 does not take into account the phase profile of the beam , only the amplitude , or irradiance distribution .",
    "this kind of optimization problem is called _ incoherent beam shaping_. as a result , optimized beams may exhibit large transverse phase fluctuations , which in turn results in an poor field depth .",
    "this is a major impediment to applications such as atom guiding @xcite and microscopy @xcite , where beams with large field depths ( low divergence ) are needed . in order to achieve",
    "_ coherent beam shaping _",
    ", we must define another objective function related to phase fluctuations of the transverse profile .",
    "our proposal is to minimize the following integral @xmath6   \\big|^2 dy}{\\int |\\bar{u}(x_0,y)|^2 dy } \\ ] ] where @xmath7 / \\mathrm{re }   [ u(x , y ) ] $ ] .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is zero for a collimated beam ( plane phase front ) , and increases with the number of oscillations in the phase front .    to illustrate the potential of multiobjective optimization techniques in integrated photonics design , we apply them to the problem of coherent beam shaping .",
    "the desired output beam and target plane can be arbitrary @xcite .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we choose to generate hermite - gauss beam profiles of half - width @xmath9 and order 2 at the device output , that is @xmath10 ^ 2 \\exp \\left ( -\\xi^2   \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath11 .",
    "we also seek a normalized beam profile , since backscattering losses are mostly unavoidable in phc devices @xcite .",
    "the basic scatterer geometry is a @xmath12 square lattice of air holes embedded in a medium of index @xmath13 , for a total of @xmath14 possible scatterers .",
    "the diameter of all holes is set to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lattice constant .",
    "for definiteness , we prescribe our incident beam as a tm - polarized non - paraxial gaussian beam with a half - width @xmath17 and a wavenumber @xmath18 for a rayleigh distance @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , a mirror symmetry across the @xmath20 axis is taken into account , resulting in @xmath21 possible solutions , or @xmath22 .",
    "the simultaneous minimization of multiple objective functions ( in this case @xmath5 and @xmath8 ) can be tackled using a set of techniques known as _ multiobjective optimization_. those techniques have been used in economics for several decades , and more recently in sciences and engineering .",
    "since it is not generally possible to minimize the entire set of objective functions , the solution of a mop is not a single solution , but rather a set of solutions termed _ pareto optimal _ solutions .",
    "a solution is called pareto optimal if it is not possible to improve a given objective without deteriorating at least another @xcite .",
    "the resolution of a mop therefore amounts to obtaining the pareto optimal set of solutions . since many real - world problem including photonics design",
    "are np - hard , the sampling of the pareto set must be achieved using metaheuristics such as the genetic algorithm @xcite .",
    "the genetic algorithm ( ga ) is a evolutionary algorithm based on a stochastic exploration of the solution space . in this work",
    ", we rather use the parallel tabu search ( pts ) algorithm @xcite to efficiently solve the optimization problem .",
    "the pts algorithm is based on a group of search processes exploring the solution space in a parallel fashion @xcite .",
    "one iteration of a tabu search process begins by generating all neighbours of the current solution .",
    "the best possible neighbour ( best possible value of the objective function ) is then chosen for the next iteration , unless that move is prohibited by the _ tabu list_. this list constitutes the short - term memory of the algorithm and prevents cyclic trajectories in the solution space @xcite .",
    "unlike the ga , the pts algorithm is a deterministic search algorithm ; only the initial solutions for each search process are randomly initialized .",
    "the tabu search also involves less adjustable parameters , while the parallel nature of the search ensures a covering of the solution space as good as that of the ga . to our knowledge , this is the first application of this sort of techniques to the field of integrated photonics .    in order to take our multiple objectives ( @xmath5 and @xmath8 ) into account , we make use of the so - called _ aggregation method _ to sample the pareto optimal set @xcite . in a nutshell , one defines an aggregated fitness function @xmath23 in the following fashion @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are heuristic upper bounds of both objective functions .",
    "the pareto front ( location of the set of optimal solutions ) is then sampled by running several pts using different values of the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "this has the effect of increasing or decreasing the relative importance of @xmath8 , thereby steering the search towards different regions of the pareto optimal set . in the case of the beam shaping problem",
    ", this simple implementation of a mop amounts to solving a single - objective minimization problem over a @xmath28dimensional space , multiple times with different fitness functions .",
    "the sampling of the pareto front was performed using 7 different values of @xmath29 $ ] . for each of those values ,",
    "48 tabu search processes are executed in parallel , each totalling 5000 iterations .",
    "this set of search processes yields a number of final solutions , out of which we extract the optimal solutions .",
    "a solution is pareto optimal if there is no solution found that is characterized by a lower value of both @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the best possible value for each of the two objectives.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .",
    "* left column : * solution with ( @xmath30 ) = ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "* center column : * solution with ( @xmath30 ) = ( @xmath32 ) . * right column : * solution with ( @xmath30 ) = ( @xmath33 ) . ]",
    "pareto optimal results , as well as the various sub - optimal ( non - pareto ) solutions , are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] .",
    "the set of pareto solutions found offer the best possible compromise between an accurate amplitude profile and a uniform phase front .",
    "as illustration , three sample pareto solutions are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "the configuration on the left offers the most accurate reproduction of a hermite - gauss beam profile .",
    "however , the non - uniformity of the phase front results in a poor field depth . inversely",
    ", the configuration on the right exhibits a mostly uniform phase front , but is not close to the amplitude profile of a order 2 hermite - gauss beam .",
    "the central configuration exhibits the best trade - off between the two required attributes , keeping a hermite - gaussian profile over a greater distance .",
    "it should be noted that the `` optimality '' of the solutions strongly depends on a given application .",
    "the results on fig . [ fig : pareto ] rather give a snapshot of the potential of the pre - defined photonic lattice .",
    "we also stress the fact that multiobjective techniques can readily take other objectives into account . for instance",
    ", one could seek to minimize the backscattering losses associated to the finite photonic cystal .",
    "however , since at least all pareto solutions of a @xmath34 objective problem are necessary solutions of the same problem with a greater number of objectives , the computational cost increases accordingly @xcite .",
    "in this contribution , we have reported the possibility to control the coherent profile ( amplitude and phase ) of the output beam in a phc - based integrated beam shaping device .",
    "the shaping problem was formulated in terms of two objective functions , one for the amplitude and one for the phase of the transformed beam .",
    "a parallel tabu search algorithm was used to sample the pareto front ( optimal solutions ) of the resulting multiobjective problem .",
    "our results show that multiobjective optimization of integrated photonics devices is within reach of currently available algorithms .",
