    "<S> a recent result , relating the ( irreversible ) work performed on a system during a non - quasistatic process , to the helmholtz free energy difference between two equilibrium states of the system , is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a proof of this result is given for the special case when the evolution of the system in question is modelled by a langevin equation in configuration space .    </S>",
    "<S> my purpose in this talk is to present and discuss a result which relates the free energy difference between two equilibrium states of a system  defined with respect to two values of an external parameter  to the work performed on the system by changing that parameter _ at a finite rate _ from one value to the other .    </S>",
    "<S> let me begin with a fundamental statement from classical thermodynamics@xcite : the total work performed on a system during an isothermal , </S>",
    "<S> _ quasistatic _ </S>",
    "<S> process is equal to the free energy difference between the initial and final equilibrium states of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this statement may be understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> imagine a finite system which depends on some external parameter , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> macroscopically , an _ equilibrium state _ is the unique state attained by the system by allowing it to come to equilibrium with an infinite heat reservoir at temperature @xmath1 , holding @xmath0 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> such a state may be represented by a single point in the @xmath2-plane , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . with each equilibrium state </S>",
    "<S> we may associate a free energy @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote , respectively , the internal energy and the entropy of the system , both functions of the state . </S>",
    "<S> if we now prepare the system in a state @xmath7 , and then infinitely slowly change the value of @xmath0 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , always keeping the system thermostatted ( i.e.  in contact with the heat reservoir ) at temperature @xmath1 , then the system will evolve through a continuous sequence of equilibrium states  represented by the dotted line in fig.[fig1 ]  and the net external work which we perform during this process will equal the free energy difference between the initial and final states : @xmath10 the subscript on @xmath11 reminds us that this process is carried out quasistatically .    at the microscopic level , we must treat the system statistically , replacing the unique macroscopic state by a probability distribution ( or ensemble ) of micro - states of the system . </S>",
    "<S> an equilibrium state of the sort discussed in the previous paragraph is represented by a canonical ensemble in the microscopic phase space , and the free energy is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the partition function . during a process in which the system remains thermostatted while @xmath0 is varied quasistatically from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , the statistical state of the system evolves through a continuous sequence of canonical ensembles , and again the work performed is equal to the free energy difference between initial and final equilibrium states : @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : qstat ] is thus a basic statement from both macroscopic thermodynamics and microscopic statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the central point which i wish to make is that there exists a comparably simple result , which relates @xmath15 ( _ defined _ as the free energy difference between two equilibrium states @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) to the work performed during a process in which @xmath0 is changed from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at a _ </S>",
    "<S> finite _ rate ; hence , a _ nonequilibrium _ , irreversible process .    </S>",
    "<S> consider therefore the following sequence of steps . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) with @xmath0 fixed at an initial value ( @xmath8 ) , we let the system equilibrate with a reservoir at temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) we then externally `` switch '' @xmath0 from the initial value ( @xmath8 ) to a final one ( @xmath9 ) over a finite time @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for specificity , assume @xmath19 to be constant . ) </S>",
    "<S> the system remains in contact with the reservoir as we switch @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) once @xmath0 reaches its destination ( @xmath9 ) , we note down the external work @xmath11 which we performed on the system during this process . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) go back to step 1 and repeat _ ad infinitum_. steps 1 - 3 define what i will call a single _ realization _ of the switching process ; by virtue of step 4 , we obtain a _ statistical ensemble _ of such realizations . note that although the system begins in equilibrium with the reservoir , it does not generally remain so once we start changing @xmath0 at a finite rate . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the system will be found in a _ </S>",
    "<S> nonequilibrium _ state , not characterized by a single point @xmath2 ( though the value of @xmath0 is of course well defined at every instant ) . </S>",
    "<S> schematically , i have depicted this situation by representing the evolution of the system as a shaded area , see fig.[fig2 ] , rather than as a single line as in fig.[fig1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> ( at the end of the switching process , we can of course always opt to hold the value of @xmath0 fixed , at @xmath9 , and allow the system to relax to equilibrium with the reservoir , in this way finally attaining the equilibrium state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this then gives us a prescription for going from one equilibrium state , @xmath16 , to another , @xmath17 , via a nonequilibrium process . </S>",
    "<S> however , once we stop changing the external parameter @xmath0 , we stop performing external work on the system . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the central result to be presented below , which makes a statement about the work @xmath11 performed externally , is independent of whether or not we carry out the supplementary step of allowing the system to relax to state @xmath17 at the end of the switching process . )    since the switching described in step 2 above is carried out at a finite rate , we expect statistical fluctuations : the work @xmath11 will differ from one realization to the next . </S>",
    "<S> thus , having obtained a statistical ensemble of realizations by repeating steps 1 - 3 _ ad nauseum _ , we will have a distribution of values of work , @xmath20 , defined such that @xmath21 gives the proportion of realizations for which the work fell within an infinitesimal window @xmath22 around a particular value @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the distribution @xmath20 will depend on how slowly or quickly the switching was performed , that is , on the switching time @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> ( in carrying out steps 1 - 4 above , it was assumed that @xmath18 remained the same from one realization to the next . ) for @xmath23 , we get @xmath24 , by eq.[eq : qstat ] , whereas for @xmath18 finite we expect the distribution @xmath20 to have a finite width . </S>",
    "<S> generically , the faster we switch @xmath0 , the larger the expected fluctuations in @xmath11 , as depicted in fig.[fig3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> one final point before i reach the punch line . while @xmath25 in the quasistatic , reversible limit ( @xmath23 ) , for _ finite _ switching times we expect the work performed to exceed the free energy difference @xmath15 : @xmath26 where the overbar denotes an average over our statistical ensemble of realizations of the switching process , carried out at a fixed value of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this statement does not preclude an occasional measurement of @xmath11 which falls _ below _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 , though for macroscopic systems such fluctuations will be exceedingly rare . ) the inequality given by eq.[eq : ineq ] essentially follows from the second law : the work performed during an irreversible process is expected to exceed that performed during the corresponding reversible process .    </S>",
    "<S> let me now make a claim which is the central focus of this talk . </S>",
    "<S> if instead of taking the average of the work @xmath11 , over a statistical ensemble of switching realizations , we take the average of the quantity @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , then _ that average will be equal to _ @xmath29 , for _ any _ value of the switching time @xmath18 : @xmath30 ( the dependence of @xmath20 on the switching time @xmath18 has been made explicit here . ) that is , the average of @xmath27 will be the same over , say , any of the three distributions shown in fig.[fig3 ] , and will equal @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : qstat ] relates the free energy difference between two equilibrium states of a system , to the work performed in _ reversibly _ taking the system from one state to the other . </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : iden ] is the extension of this statement to _ irreversible _ </S>",
    "<S> ( nonequilibrium ) processes . </S>",
    "<S> note that , since @xmath15 depends only on the equilibrium states @xmath16 and @xmath17 , eq.[eq : qstat ] implies that the reversible work performed in going from @xmath16 to @xmath17 is independent of the path taken from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> ( we have imagined only a single parameter @xmath0 , but of course more generally parameter space can be multi - dimensional . ) </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : iden ] makes a comparable statement as regards the _ rate _ at which we switch @xmath0 : it says that the ensemble average of @xmath27 is independent , not only of the path from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , but also of how quickly or slowly we vary @xmath0 along that path .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : iden ] gives the relationship between a quantity defined with respect to _ equilibrium _ states of a system ( @xmath15 ) to a quantity extracted from an ensemble of _ nonequilibrium _ processes . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this relationship takes the form of an _ equality _ , whereas most statements relating equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantities are expressed as inequalities , for instance , eq.[eq : ineq ] . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as i have pointed out elsewhere@xcite , the inequality @xmath31 follows immediately and rigorously from eq.[eq : iden ] .    as a quick consistency check </S>",
    "<S> , we can verify the validity of eq.[eq : iden ] in two limiting cases : infinitely slow ( @xmath32 ) and infinitely fast ( @xmath33 ) switching . </S>",
    "<S> in the former case , we get @xmath34 , and eq.[eq : iden ] is satisfied . for @xmath33 , as discussed elsewhere@xcite , eq.[eq : iden ] reduces to the following well - known identity : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the difference between the initial and final hamiltonians , and @xmath37 defines a canonical average over the initial equilibrium state .    a proof of eq.[eq : iden ] , based on a treatment in which both the system of interest and the heat reservoir are explicitly taken into consideration , was given in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another proof , based on a master equation approach , was given in ref.@xcite , along with supporting numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> yet a third proof , assuming markovian evolution and microscopic reversibility ( and which along the way yields an interesting detailed balance relationship for multiple time - step processes ) , has been found by gavin crooks@xcite .    in the spirit of this symposium </S>",
    "<S> , i will sketch a proof of eq.[eq : iden ] for the case in which the evolution of the system of interest is modelled by a langevin equation in configuration space , thus a statistical ensemble of such systems evolves under a smoluchowski equation . </S>",
    "<S> ( physically , this corresponds to the limit of overdamped evolution , in which the momentum of the system reaches equilibrium with the heat reservoir on a time scale very short compared both to that required for the configuration of the system to equilibrate , and to the time @xmath18 over which we perform the switching . ) </S>",
    "<S> although this case is a particular example of the situation considered in ref.@xcite , the proof presented here is different from those of refs.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that the hamiltonian for our system has the form @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> ( although we assume a one - dimensional configuration space , the generalization to more degrees of freedom is straightforward . ) </S>",
    "<S> the free energy difference may then be expressed in terms of a ratio of configurational partition functions : @xmath39 ( i will often use @xmath16 and @xmath17 in place of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . ) let us now take the evolution of the configuration of the system to obey a langevin equation : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a term representing white noise , @xmath42 with @xmath43 denoting an average over realizations of the noise ; and @xmath44 is the terminal velocity attained by a particle subject to both a conservative force @xmath45 , and a frictional force @xmath46 satisfying the einstein relation , @xmath47 : @xmath48 in eq.[eq : lang ] , the external parameter depends on time , according to @xmath49    a stochastic trajectory @xmath50 , @xmath51 $ ] , satisfying eq.[eq : lang ] , represents the evolution of our system during a single realization of the switching process . </S>",
    "<S> we will now make use of the fact that , for such evolution , one can write down an explicit expression for the probability distribution of trajectories @xmath50 . namely , given an initial condition @xmath52 , the probability for obtaining a particular trajectory @xmath50 , as we switch @xmath0 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , is given by:@xcite @xmath53 & = & { \\cal n } \\exp -s_{+}[x(t)]\\\\ \\label{eq : sdef } s_{\\pm}[x(t ) ] & = & { 1\\over 2d}\\int_{0}^{\\tau } dt\\ , \\bigl(\\dot x \\pm { \\beta d\\over 2 } \\partial_{x } v_{\\lambda}\\bigr)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 in the integrand of eq.[eq : sdef ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( i will make use of @xmath55 shortly . ) </S>",

    "<S> eq.[eq : genwork ] reduces to eq.[eq : work ] . </S>",
    "<S> let me now make a few comments regarding the origin of eq.[eq : genwork ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the external work performed on an _ isolated _ system is equal to the net change in its energy . </S>",
    "<S> when that work is performed by the variation of an external parameter , we get @xmath95 assuming a phase space trajectory @xmath93 evolving under hamilton s equations , so that @xmath96@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq.[eq : genwork ] is therefore the correct expression for work , provided the system is isolated during the switching process .    when the system of interest is coupled to a heat reservoir </S>",
    "<S> , then we may treat the two together as a larger , isolated system governed by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath97 here , @xmath98 represents a point in the phase space of the reservoir , @xmath99 is a hamiltonian for the reservoir alone , and @xmath100 is a term which weakly couples the system of interest to the reservoir . since the system of interest and reservoir together constitute a larger , isolated system , we may again use eq.[eq : hamwork ] for the external work performed , but with @xmath91 replaced by @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath102 , so we again end up with eq.[eq : genwork ] . </S>",
    "<S> , i was careful to make only the first term on the right depend on @xmath0 . otherwise , by externally changing @xmath0 , we would perform work directly on the degrees of freedom of the reservoir , a situation different from that considered in this talk . ] </S>",
    "<S> note that the work @xmath11 no longer represents the net change in the energy of the system of interest itself , @xmath103 , but rather the net change in the total energy of system and reservoir .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is good to keep in mind that the concept of an external parameter is itself an idealization . in reality , such a `` parameter '' must actually be a degree of freedom  subject to back reaction forces  and the work performed by it , over some length of time , is simply the net _ loss _ in its energy . </S>",
    "<S> the idealization lies in assuming an infinite inertia for this degree of freedom . to illustrate these points , </S>",
    "<S> consider a hamiltonian @xmath104 where @xmath0 now represents the degree of freedom which was previously viewed as an external parameter , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the associated inertia and momentum , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the first term on the right represents the energy of the parametric degree of freedom ; the second , as before , is the hamiltonian for the coupled system of interest and reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> hamilton s equations give @xmath107 from these we obtain the following expression for the rate of change of the energy of the `` parameter '' : @xmath108 from which , taking @xmath11 to be _ minus _ the change in @xmath109 , we once again get @xmath110 note that now the time - dependence of @xmath0 is not exactly that given by eq.[eq : loft ] , but rather is determined from hamilton s equations . </S>",
    "<S> if , however , we consider the initial conditions @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and we take the limit @xmath113 , then over any finite time interval @xmath18 we will get ( see eqs.[eq : ham1 ] and [ eq : ham2 ] ) @xmath114 thus recovering eq.[eq : loft ] for the evolution of @xmath0 .    in the preceding discussion , i have argued that eq.[eq : genwork ] ( which in turn implies eq.[eq : work ] when @xmath115 ) is the correct expression for the work performed on a system by the variation of an external parameter , both when the system is isolated and when it is coupled to a heat reservoir , and also when the external parameter is treated honestly as a degree of freedom ( but in the limit of infinite inertia ) . </S>",
    "<S> this discussion can be illustrated by considering the example of a closed container filled with gas , where one wall of the container is free to move in and out as a piston . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath0 denote the position of the piston , and @xmath116 the positions and momenta of the @xmath117 individual gas molecules .    </S>",
    "<S> when we externally move the piston at some finite rate from a position @xmath75 to another position @xmath118 , we perform a quantity of work each time a gas molecule scatters off the moving wall ; that work is just the change in the kinetic energy of the molecule during the collision . </S>",
    "<S> if the container is isolated , then this is the only mechanism by which the energy of the gas can change , so at the end of the switching process the work performed is equal to the change in the internal energy of the gas . </S>",
    "<S> it is a straightforward exercise@xcite to show explicitly ( without invoking the hamiltonian identity @xmath119 ) that the change in the energy of the gas , during a given collision between a molecule and the moving wall , is equal to the time integral of @xmath120 along the trajectory @xmath93 describing the phase space evolution of the gas , from a time immediately before to a time immediately after the collision . the total change in energy ( and therefore the work performed ) over some finite period of time is then just the integral of @xmath120 along @xmath93 , over that span of time .    </S>",
    "<S> now imagine that the wall of the container opposite to the piston is externally maintained at some temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> then there exist two mechanisms by which the energy of the gas changes : by the scattering of a molecule off the moving piston , as above , and by the scattering of a molecule off the thermostatted wall . </S>",
    "<S> as before , the net contribution of the former is the time integral of @xmath120 ( even though the trajectory @xmath93 is no longer hamiltonian ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is only this contribution which counts as _ work _ </S>",
    "<S> performed on the gas : the sum of all the energy changes due to collisions with the thermostatted wall is the _ heat _ absorbed or relinquished by the gas . </S>",
    "<S> thus we again obtain eq.[eq : genwork ] .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , suppose the piston is itself a massive object , moving frictionlessly from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , rather than an externally pushed device . </S>",
    "<S> as before , work is performed by the piston every time a molecule scatters off it ( and again the total work is given by the integral of @xmath120 ) , but now the kinetic energy of the piston changes at each such collision . if the piston begins with a speed @xmath121 , and is then observed for a time @xmath18 , then the final speed will be @xmath122 @xmath105 being the mass of the piston . for any set of initial conditions of the gas , we get @xmath123 in the limit @xmath113 , so in that limit the speed of the piston remains constant , just as if it were being driven externally . </S>",
    "<S> ( in other words , for an infinitely massive piston , the work performed by it on the gas represents an infinitesimal proportional change in the piston s kinetic energy . ) </S>"
