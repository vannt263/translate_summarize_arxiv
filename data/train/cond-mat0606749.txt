    "a number of systems , including moving vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors with disordered pinning @xcite , sliding charge - density waves @xcite , and driven wigner crystals @xcite , can be modeled as moving lattices interacting with random quenched disorder .",
    "if the external driving force is weak the particles are pinned , while at high external drives the particles can slide .",
    "there is extensive evidence that in the sliding phase the particles organize into a moving anisotropic crystal or moving smectic phase and that the motion is confined to well defined channels @xcite .",
    "a remarkable property of these channels is that if an additional external drive is applied in the _ transverse _ direction the moving system exhibits a finite transverse depinning threshold @xcite .",
    "this transverse depinning threshold has been confirmed in a number of simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "a transverse depinning barrier is also present for particles moving over a periodic substrate . in this type of system ,",
    "the transverse velocity force curves exhibit a devil s staircase structure as the particle motion locks to the symmetry directions of the periodic substrate @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs even for a single particle moving over a periodic substrate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a single particle moving over a random substrate will not show a transverse depinning threshold or a devil s staircase response .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a finite transverse depinning force was predicted for a vortex lattice , and it was also conjectured that a moving lattice would align with the direction of the initial longitudinal drive in order to minimize power dissipation . if the moving lattice remains aligned in this initial orientation as a transverse drive is applied , the transverse velocity force curves could exhibit a devil s staircase response as the applied force vector locks with the triangular symmetry of the moving lattice .",
    "in contrast to a system with a periodic substrate , here the symmetry breaking which leads to the preferred directions of motion comes from the moving lattice itself . numerically observing the devil s staircase in a system with random disorder",
    "can be difficult since large systems and long time averages of the transverse velocity are needed to reduce the fluctuations .",
    "an added difficultly with observing this type of devil s staircase is that fine increments of the applied transverse force are required to resolve the higher order steps .",
    "another possibility for the dynamics at the transverse depinning transition which has not been considered is that the moving lattice structure could become strongly disordered at the depinning transition , leading to plastic distortions .",
    "if such a _ plastic transverse depinning _ occurs , it is natural to ask if the particles would reorder into a tilted channel structure , causing a new transverse barrier to develop .",
    "to address these issues we consider two types of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the first is a vortex system containing @xmath0 vortices and @xmath1 short range random pinning sites .",
    "the vortices are modeled as point particles and their dynamics evolve via an overdamped equation of motion , given for vortex @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the damping constant .",
    "the vortex - vortex interaction force @xcite is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the modified bessel function , @xmath7 is the distance between vortices @xmath2 and @xmath8 located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , the unit of force is @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the flux quantum , and the london penetration depth @xmath14 is the unit of length .",
    "this interaction is appropriate for stiff 3d vortices in relatively thick films where the film thickness @xmath15 is much larger than @xmath14 but is smaller than the larkin - ovchinnikov correlation length @xcite .",
    "time is measured in units of @xmath16 and a molecular dynamics ( md ) time step is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "we find identical results if smaller time steps are used . for a 0.1@xmath18 m thick crystal of nbse@xmath19 , @xmath20n / m and @xmath21 ns / m @xcite , so that @xmath22s .",
    "the pinning force @xmath23 arises from pinning sites which are modeled as attractive parabolic potentials of radius @xmath24 and strength @xmath25 : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the distance between vortex @xmath2 and pin @xmath28 located at @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the pinning interaction is intended to represent columnar pinning @xcite .",
    "the net external driving force @xmath32 is comprised of the longitudinal force applied in the @xmath33-direction , @xmath34 , and the transverse force applied in the @xmath35-direction , @xmath36 .",
    "the vortex ( pin ) density is given by @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the system is prepared by simulated annealing , after which a longitudinal force is gradually applied in increments of @xmath39 up to a specific value .",
    "the final longitudinal driving force is held fixed and then the transverse drive is applied in small increments .",
    "we measure the transverse velocity @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the velocity of vortex @xmath2 .",
    "we also measure the fraction of sixfold coordinated vortices , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the coordination number of vortex @xmath2 as determined from a voronoi construction .",
    "the second system we consider is sliding wigner crystals composed of @xmath44 electrons .",

    "the number of electrons @xmath44 equals the number of impurities @xmath1 . both the electron - electron and electron impurity interactions are long range , and we evaluate them with a fast - converging sum @xcite . to measure the transverse response ,",
    "we follow a similar procedure as in the vortex system .",
    "we first consider a vortex system for a sample of size @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and fixed longitudinal drive @xmath57 .",

    "there is a finite transverse depinning threshold and the transverse depinning occurs without the generation of additional defects . in the intermediate regime @xmath62 , the equilibrium @xmath63 state contains dislocations , and for @xmath64",
    "the transverse depinning is plastic and is accompanied by the generation of defects . under a longitudinal drive , for @xmath65 the vortices dynamically reorder into a defect - free lattice , while for @xmath66 the vortices undergo a partial dynamical reordering into a moving smectic state containing a finite number of dislocations that are all aligned with the driving direction , as seen in previous simulations @xcite .",
    "the number of defects in the moving smectic state gradually increases with increasing @xmath25 until each row of vortices is completely decoupled from the neighboring rows .",
