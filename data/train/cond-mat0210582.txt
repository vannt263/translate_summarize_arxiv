    "in recent years there has been growing interest in studies of monatomic chains obtained in the processes of heteroepitaxial growth @xcite at various substrates .",
    "a major goal of these studies is to obtain the so - called quantum wires for potential use in microelectronic applications . in these experiments",
    "one usually aims at obtaining wires of infinite length for subsequent use in the studies of the luttinger liquid @xcite . in practice",
    ", however , one frequently encounters the monatomic wires of finite length",
    ". these may be useful in more practical applications , such as the microelectronic circuitry @xcite .",
    "such finite 1d clusters were observed , e. g. , in refs .",
    "current theoretical interest is in magnetic properties of finite monatomic clusters @xcite in view of their potential use in magnetic memory devices .",
    "the latter application , however , will require the development of the techniques of mass production of such objects . in this context it would be interesting to study the possibility of their self - assembly and self - organization similar to analogous processes in 2d heteroepitaxial systems @xcite .    in the present paper we consider an analytic solution for the cluster size distribution in the framework of a 1d lattice gas model with an arbitrary number of cluster interactions within contiguous atomic chains plus the next nearest neighbor pair interaction .",
    "such model can be justified in the framework of the frenkel - kontorova model of strained epitaxy @xcite but also can be useful in other cases , e. g. , in _ ab initio _ approaches , where the cluster interactions appear because of the many - body nature of the electron interactions which can not be reduced to the pair interatomic potential .",
    "let us consider a lattice gas model defined by the function @xmath0 describing the dependence of the energy of 1d atomic clusters ( or chains ) on their length @xmath1 .",
    "such a model was already used for the description of the self - assembly phenomena in ref .",
    "we note , however , that in 2d this approach can be only phenomenological because the cluster size does not characterize a 2d structure uniquely .",
    "in contrast , in 1d the cluster is defined unambiguously by its length and the function @xmath0 is also uniquely defined provided the clusters do not interact .    to apply standard tools of statistical physics we need to find the hamiltonian corresponding to our model . to this end",
    "we consider the following trial expression @xmath2 where @xmath3 are numerical coefficients to be fitted to reproduce the chain energies @xmath0 and @xmath4 the occupation numbers taking values 0 or 1 depending on whether site @xmath5 is empty or is occupied by an atom .",
    "assuming we have already fitted @xmath6 to the energies @xmath7 let us consider the chain of length @xmath1 . from eq .",
    "( [ frelax2 ] ) one finds @xmath8 where the @xmath9 terms on the right hand side ( r. h. s. ) account for the interactions of the newly added atom with the rest .",
    "similarly @xmath10 subtracting eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ l+1 ] ) we get @xmath11 from where it follows that the hamiltonian of our model is eq .",
    "( [ frelax2 ] ) with the coefficients given by the recursion relation @xmath12 initialized by @xmath13 . for",
    "the system to be well defined in the thermodynamic limit the chain energy @xmath14 can not grow quicker then linearly when @xmath15 .",
    "this means that the the cluster interactions @xmath16 tend to zero at large @xmath1 because according to eq .",
    "( [ v_l ] ) they are equal to the discrete second derivative of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath1 .    in the above model atoms interact only when they belong to the same contiguous chain , so that separate chains are not coupled to each other . to make the model more realistic we allow for the interchain coupling by adding to the hamiltonian ( [ frelax2 ] ) the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) pair interaction term @xmath17",
    "we consider a 1d lattice with a fixed number of atoms @xmath18 which can occupy @xmath19 lattice sites . our major goal in this paper is to find the equilibrium distribution of the atomic chain sizes at finite temperature @xmath20 in the model defined by hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "but first we will consider the above problem using a simpler hamiltonian ( [ frelax2 ] ) , i. e. , by neglecting the nnn interaction which will be accounted for later .",
    "we will seek the canonical ensemble solution of our problem by generalizing the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach one",
    "first have to compute the energy of the system in terms of cluster variables @xmath21the number of clusters of length @xmath1 and their energy @xmath0 . because the @xmath22 limit is not completely trivial ,",
    "we calculate the configurational energy by assuming that all @xmath23 with @xmath24 are equal to zero . in this case",
    "the total energy can be calculated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the first ( discrete ) derivative of @xmath14 , @xmath27 is the total number of clusters of length exceeding @xmath28 which below we will call the big clusters , and @xmath29 is the number of atoms contained in the big clusters .",
    "the last two terms on the r. h. s. of eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) can be verified by first checking their correctness for @xmath30 and then noting that cutting a big cluster into two ones amounts to cutting @xmath31 couplings of type @xmath23 . to complete the calculation of the total free energy @xmath32",
    "it remains to compute the entropy @xmath33 .",
    "the number of atomic configurations can be expressed through the cluster variables as @xmath34 in this equality the first multiplier on the r. h. s. counts all inequivalent permutations between the clusters with all big clusters being considered as equivalent while the second factor accounts for the number of ways to divide @xmath35 atoms into @xmath27 big clusters including their permutations .",
    "we find this factor by observing that the division of @xmath35 atoms into clusters of sizes exceeding @xmath28 is equivalent to dividing @xmath36 atoms into @xmath37 clusters .",
    "the latter quantity was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite to be equal to the binomial coefficient @xmath38 provided @xmath39 .",
    "otherwise it is equal to zero .",
    "the meaning of this formula is simple . in a contiguous chain of @xmath40 atoms",
    "there is @xmath41 places to cut the chain into pieces .",
    "@xmath42 pieces can be obtained with @xmath43 cuts .",
    "hence , the number of the possible cuts of @xmath40 atoms into @xmath42 pieces is equal exactly to the above combinatorial coefficient . to complete the calculation of the total number of configurations we have to multiply @xmath44 by the corresponding factor responsible for the configurations of vacant sites  @xcite . but before doing this we repair eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) by accounting for the omitted nnn pair interaction .",
    "to this end we note that as long as the contiguous chains are concerned , @xmath45 interaction amounts simply to renormalization of @xmath46 .",
    "additionally this term introduces the interchain coupling between the chains separated by a single vacant site ( a vacancy ) .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath47 , where @xmath48 the number of vacancies , should be added to the r. h. s. of eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) ( here and above we do not pay attention to the boundary conditions  @xcite because in this paper we are interested only in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "so when counting the configurations of empty sites we should separate the configurations with different numbers of vacancies .",
    "this is achieved by using eq .",
    "( [ omega1 ] ) with the total number of empty sites @xmath49 instead of @xmath18 , the big clusters in this case should exceed @xmath50 . denoting the total number of clusters as @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) we get @xmath51 our final expression for @xmath33 is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ omega1 ] ) and ( [ omega2 ] ) with the use of the stirling formula as @xmath52\\ln[\\theta_>-(l-2)c_>]-[\\theta_>-(l-1)c _ > ] \\ln[\\theta_>-(l-1)c_>],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the total coverage , @xmath54 is the concentration of clusters of length @xmath1 , @xmath55 the total cluster concentration , @xmath56 the vacancy concentration , @xmath57 .",
    "this expression for reduced entropy together with the reduced energy obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) are sufficient to obtain the reduced free energy as a function of the unknown quantities @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . minimizing it with respect to these variables we arrive in the limit @xmath61 at the following set of equations",
    "@xmath62 to find the above limit it is necessary to know the asymptotic behavior of @xmath63 at large @xmath1 .",
    "the limit was taken by assuming the exponential behavior @xmath64 which is consistent with the resulting equation  ( [ c_l ] ) .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ c_l2 ] ) is of the second order in @xmath60 , so one can exclude this variable from the first equation to obtain a closed equation for @xmath58 . from the above set , however , it is easier to see that if the nnn interaction is negative , than @xmath65 as @xmath66 , i.  e. , the vacancy concentration becomes equal to the concentration of clusters which means that the system becomes ordered : the clusters self - organize into chains separated by monovacancies .",
    "this is further confirmed by the fact that the entropy eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) tends to zero at zero temperature provided @xmath67 and the clusters are size calibrated",
    ". indeed , in the limit @xmath68 only the first two lines of eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) survive    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the entropy per site .    in connection with this expression",
    "it is worth noting that eqs .",
    "( [ c_l ] ) and ( [ c_l2 ] ) can formally be obtained in the thermodynamic limit from the variation with respect to @xmath63 of the expression for the free energy density @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the lagrange multiplier .",
    "this derivation , however , may cause doubts in the case of clusters of sizes @xmath73 when the terms @xmath74 in the above equation acquire discrete values and so are not suitable for the variational treatment .",
    "the derivation presented above is more rigorous and besides can be modified to be applicable to finite systems @xcite .    at @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath76 the entropy density ( [ s ] ) takes the form @xmath77 thus , if the clusters at @xmath75 are size calibrated , i. e. , if for some value of @xmath78 @xmath79 while @xmath80 for all other @xmath1 , then from the above equation it follows that @xmath81 . for @xmath82",
    "the entropy is positive even at @xmath75 meaning disordered state .",
    "the issue of size calibration will be considered in more detail in section [ sizecalibration ] .",
    "to check eqs .",
    "( [ c_l ] ) and ( [ c_l2 ] ) we will apply them to the known exactly solvable problem  the 1d ising model .",
    "as is known , it is equivalent to the lattice gas model with pair interatomic interaction .",
    "this can be easily shown ( see @xcite ch .",
    "ii ) by substituting @xmath83 ( @xmath84the ising spin variable ) into the lgm hamiltonian @xmath85 thus , the ising model with nn interaction can be solved in the canonical ensemble formalism with the use of our formulas . in this section",
    "we will obtain the appropriate formulas in closed analytical form .",
    "also , we will compare our results obtained in the canonical ensemble with more familiar results obtained in the grand canonical formalism via the transfer matrix method .",

    "both values coincided within 13 - 15 significant digits depending on how singular the values of @xmath111 are at the chosen values of @xmath110 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus we have solved the 1d nn lgm in the canonical ensemble approach and expressed all quantities of interest in terms of the atomic density ( or coverage ) @xmath92 which is more natural and easier to measure quantity then the chemical potential variable of the grand canonical formalism .",
    "according to ref .",

    "@xcite .",
    "although the entropic contribution into @xmath14 is rather small due to the small temperatures considered , the shallowness of the minimum in @xmath112 makes it possible that the above shift of the maximum is due to the shift in the position of the minimum in @xmath126 with lowering temperature . to check this possibility we repeated calculations with",

    "[ fig2 ] is that the bimodal distribution is never observed in the case of @xmath20-independent case .",
    "presumably , this is due to the 1d character of our model , because in 2d case where also @xmath20-independent interactions were used we found a strongly bimodal distribution @xcite .",
    "in this paper we considered an analytical solution of a 1d lattice gas model with an arbitrary number of cluster interatomic interactions within contiguous atomic chains .",
    "we illustrated the model by applying it to the description of the equilibrium distribution of atomic clusters in strained epitaxy in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "our analytical solution confirms the observation made in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of a phenomenological approach that the maximum in the _ equilibrium _ distribution of the cluster sizes moves to higher values with lowering temperature .",
