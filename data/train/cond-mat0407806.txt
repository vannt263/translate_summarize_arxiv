    "one important question addressed in this context is to know if synchronization between oscillators in such complex topologies would appear and under which conditions it prevails .",
    "in fact , coherent behavior of oscillator networks with complex topologies has been studied for the random topology @xcite and small - world topology @xcite .",
    "however , apart from a few exceptions @xcite , there is a quite general lack of studies tackling synchronization of chaotic oscillators in scale - free topologies .    in this paper",

    "in the previous section we focused on random scale - free networks , i.e.  growing networks where new nodes are connected following probabilistic rules . although this stochasticity is typical for real networks , it is more difficult to handle analytically @xcite . in this section",
    "we study a different type of networks : deterministic scale - free networks @xcite .",

    "adds at the center of each of these three triangles a new node , connected to the three vertices of the triangle , defining nine new triangles ; at iteration @xmath87 one adds one new node at the center of each of these nine triangles , and so on ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig5 ] , despite having quite similar structural properties @xcite , the global dynamics of the entirely deterministic scale - free networks shows quite different behavior than the one observed for the barabsi - albert model in the previous section .",

    "the standard mean square - deviation is even larger , since the coupling is not strong enough to compensate the highly chaotic local dynamics ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "is characterized by significantly smaller values for the standard mean square - deviation .",
    "the results observed in the histograms of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are somehow surprising , since irregular variations of the standard mean square - deviation occur for low nonlinearity and high coupling strengths , precisely where one would expect the most regular behavior of the node dynamics .",

    "since one also observes almost no coherent solution for random scale - free networks neither for @xmath94 nor for @xmath95 ( see section [ sec : barabasi ] ) , we believe that the outgoing connectivity @xmath1 is the main parameter controlling synchronization between oscillators in complex networks . by choosing",
    "another deterministic scale - free network with a higher outgoing connectivity , say @xmath123 , one might see coherent solutions beyond a coupling threshold value approximately similar to those computed for random scale - free networks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we will consider the two deterministic scale - free topologies , and study possible ways of inducing coherent states",

    "for instance , in the apollonian network , the first generation has @xmath126 nodes , the second has @xmath127 and the @xmath79th generation has @xmath128 nodes . in other words , we are interested in the collective effects when the most connected nodes ( hubs ) are synchronized .",
    "we will show that , in fact , hubs play no dominant role for the synchronization of nodes .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the standard mean square - deviation as a function of coupling strength for pseudo - fractal ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]a ) and apollonian networks ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) . in each case",
    "we choose the fully chaotic map ( @xmath16 ) and impose synchronization among the nodes of the first @xmath129 generations by setting them to be their mean amplitude at each time - step .    for both networks , one sees from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] that the standard mean square - deviation remains large when synchronization is imposed to all @xmath130 generations .",
    "coherent solutions are only observed for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , beyond a coupling threshold which is smaller for the latter case .",
    "surprisingly , for @xmath133 the transition to coherence occurs precisely for the same coupling strength in both networks .",
    "this may be due to the fact that , the fraction @xmath134 of nodes on which one imposes synchronization is approximately the same for both networks . for @xmath131",
    "the pseudo - fractal network shows coherence only above very high coupling strengths , near @xmath135 , while for apollonian networks the threshold is much lower .",
    "although in this case the fraction of nodes on which one imposes synchronization is also similar for both networks , it is much smaller than in the case where @xmath133 .",
    "the transition to coherence occurs at different coupling strengths because the number of synchronized nodes is not enough to suppress the effect of the outgoing connectivity .",
    "so , since the outgoing connectivity is larger for the apollonian network , its transition to coherence occurs for weaker coupling strengths . for both networks ,",
    "one obtains similar results for any higher value @xmath124 of generations since the quotient of the number of nodes between two successive generations @xmath136 as @xmath79 increases .    as a general remark",

    "[ fig7 ] that one needs to synchronize a rather high number of generations to induce coherence .",

    "[ fig7]a and [ fig7]b , the transition to coherence is of first - order .",
    "another way to induce coherence in these two deterministic scale - free networks is , instead of imposing synchronization to the most connected nodes , to strengthen their coupling to the other nodes by taking @xmath137 in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] illustrates the transition to coherence by varying the heterogeneity @xmath17 for the pseudo - fractal ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]a ) and the apollonian network ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]b ) . for both networks",
    ", one sees that coherence sets in for @xmath138 , and only beyond a certain threshold of the coupling strength .",
    "in particular , one observes the remarkable fact that coherence appears only in an intermediate coupling range , i.e.  neither to large nor to small values .",
    "this is in agreement with previous works @xcite concerning other systems of coupled chaotic oscillators , where one also observes that synchronized chaos requires that the coupling must be neither too weak nor too strong in order to avoid triggering spatial instabilities @xcite . from figs .",
    "[ fig8]c and [ fig8]d one observes that all these transitions to coherence are of first - order .    for the pseudo - fractal ,",
    "the upper threshold disappears when the heterogeneity @xmath17 is further increased .",
    "however , for the apollonian network the upper threshold not only persists but it shifts toward smaller and smaller coupling strengths when @xmath17 is further increased .",
    "as far as we know , this is the first time that one observes such behavior , and it should be related to the geometrical differences between both networks .",
    "in other words , since apollonian is a very particular scale - free network , being the only one , studied so far which is embedded in euclidean space , this particular feature seems to enable nontrivial synchronization behavior : stronger dominance in the coupling to the most connected nodes _ destroys _ coherence .",
    "in this paper we studied fully synchronized solutions for three scale - free network topologies .",
    "the main conclusion is the following : in random scale - free networks synchronization of chaotic maps not only depends on the coupling strength but is mainly controlled by the outgoing connectivity @xmath1 , which is a measure of cohesion in the networks . because of that , one finds coherent solutions in random scale - free networks of fully chaotic logistic maps ( @xmath16 ) with outgoing connectivity @xmath139 and homogeneous coupling , but not in deterministic scale - free networks , since they have rather small effective outgoing connectivity , namely @xmath94 for the pseudo - fractal network and @xmath95 for the apollonian network .",
    "therefore , although the exponent @xmath75 of connection distributions in scale - free networks does not depend on the outgoing connectivity @xcite , we have shown that , in general , synchronization of chaotic maps in such coupling topologies is quite sensitive to it . moreover ,",
    "the transition to coherence is of first - order , indicating a similarity with other complex networks @xcite .",
    "in particular , the threshold values of the coupling strength obey a power - law , eq .",
    "( [ powerlaw ] ) , as function of the outgoing connectivity .",
    "the exponent of this power - law depends on the nonlinearity @xmath14 of the chaotic map , being almost constant below @xmath140 and decreasing linearly above it .",
    "interestingly this value of @xmath141 is in the vicinity of the bifurcation of the quadratic map where the period-@xmath83 window appears , and coincides with the appearance of other nontrivial behaviors in coupled map lattices with regular topologies , namely in the velocity distribution of traveling wave solutions @xcite .",
    "the synchronization criterion was based here in the square mean standard deviation following previous studies @xcite . of course",
    ", it could be possible to have numerically a zero standard deviation @xmath57 with a particular oscillator slightly nonsynchronized .",
    "however , in such case the deviation of the oscillator amplitude from the rest of the network would be of the order of @xmath142 , a majorant of the precision for our criterion . therefore , we believe that within this numerical precision there are no spurious results .",
    "further investigations could be done , implementing extensions of clustering criteria such as , e.g. , that of pikovsky et al .",
    "@xcite .    for deterministic scale - free networks with homogeneous coupling ,",
    "the same value @xmath141 indicates the threshold above which no coherent solutions are observed , independently of the coupling strength . above @xmath141 , coherence is observed only for heterogeneous coupling , namely for @xmath143 .",
    "however , for this range of values , we have also shown that coherence is also absent either for very small or for very large coupling strengths , due to spatial instabilities .",
    "another particularly interesting result that still needs to be explained is that , for apollonian networks , the coupling threshold beyond which coherence disappears gets smaller when the heterogeneity is further increased .",
    "this point is not observed for the pseudo - fractal network and may be due to the geometrical differences between both deterministic networks .    as a general property",
    ", we have shown that all transitions to coherence are of first - order .",
    "furthermore , all results are robust not only against changes of the initial configurations of node amplitude but also , in random scale - free networks , against changes of the connection network .",
    "we also presented preliminary results indicating that in scale - free networks hubs play apparently no fundamental role in the dynamical collective behavior , what remains to be further investigated .",
