    "novel metamaterials @xcite , in particular those for which the spatial distribution of optical parameters can be specifically tailor  made , have proven to be a viable route to realize various linear , nonlinear or tunable optical properties and processes . amongst them , the hyperbolic metamaterials ( hm ) - indefinite metamaterials , for which the permittivity and permeability tensors are negative along only certain of the principal axes of the metamaterial @xcite - attract interest because of possibilities of optical steering and manipulation . closely related are optical effects like negative refraction @xcite , hyperlensing @xcite , cancellation of reflection and transmission @xcite .",
    "optical devices based on indefinite media are designed , like , e.g. , polarization beam splitters @xcite , angular filters @xcite , optical transmission modulator @xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches were worked out to handle the negative refraction in anisotropic indefinite media have also been presented @xcite .",
    "tunability and simple production become important requirements .",
    "one of the few metamaterials which offer tunability @xcite , is nematic liquid crystal ( nlc ) doped with coated core - shell spheres ( ndlc ) @xcite .",
    "recently we have demonstrated a negative refraction in near infra - red ( ir ) in this system with a planar nlc configuration for a wide interval of incident angles of electromagnetic ( em ) wave , using finite elements ( fe ) calculations ( comsol ) @xcite .",
    "similar results in visible light range were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that a hm consisting of nlc doped with a sufficiently high concentration of silver nanoparticles can become a hm ; all - angle negative refraction for homeotropic nlc orientation was demonstrated based on geometric arguments .",
    "the point we would like to emphasize here is that a medium is indefinite is neither necessary @xcite nor a sufficient condition for negative refraction ; we shall show below that for a hm a positive refraction as well as reflection can take place .",
    "thus , additional quantitative calculations are necessary to trace the path of em in an indefinite medium .",
    "the aim of this paper is to design , using effective medium approximation and fe calculations , an electric field driven device for switching in ndlc hm between three scenarios : negative refraction , positive refraction and reflection for wide intervals of angles of incidence of em and of nlc director orientations . to this end ,",

    "the tunability is provided by varying the external electric field which changes the orientation of the nlc director , the overall effective permittivity tensor and the orientation of the hyperbola of the dispersion relation of extraordinary waves through the medium .",
    "the latter allows to control the character of electromagnetic field in the medium : propagating or evanescent .",
    "we have exploited this tunability to design a new electrooptic effect for the manipulation of light : electric field driven switch between negative and positive refraction and reflection , and have illustrated its functionality .",
