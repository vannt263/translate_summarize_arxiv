    "the role of chiral condensate is well known and well studied in the context of chiral phase transition .",
    "recently , the possible role of tetraquark condensate in connection to the chiral phase transition is also being considered  @xcite .",
    "the reason behind such consideration stems from the unsettled nature of the lightest scalar @xmath0 ( @xmath1 in @xcite ) or @xmath2 meson .",
    "this issue is part of the unresolved nature of the scalar mesons below 2 @xmath3 .",
    "there are about 19 scalar resonances found below 2 @xmath3 which can not be explained by the naive quark model . their mass spectrum and decay patterns are also quite contrary to what is expected from the quark model .",
    "an intense effort is going on to understand the nature and properties of these mesons ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    theoretical understanding of the lightest scalar @xmath4 is important as it is believed to be the higgs bosons of qcd and plays an important role in chiral symmetry breaking . though its existence has been confirmed from the @xmath5 scattering process @xcite , the consensus on its nature is still elusive . conventionally @xmath0 is regarded as composed of quark - antiquark .",
    "but in order to solve the mass hierarchy problem for scalar mesons below 1 gev , jaffe  @xcite in 1977 proposed to consider the scalar meson below 1 @xmath3 as tetraquark states and those above 1 @xmath3 to be quarkonium states .",
    "thus , in this picture @xmath0 is predominantly a tetraquark states whereas @xmath6 is the lightest quarkonium state made up of quark - antiquark .",
    "the sizable tetraquark component has also been demonstrated in a recent lattice simulation study  @xcite .",
    "however , there are other suggestions as well , for example , recent data from @xmath5 and @xmath7 scattering @xcite , the k - matrix analysis @xcite suggests that it has sizable glueball content .",
    "the role of chiral condensate as an order parameter for chiral phase transition is well established .",
    "but , the role of tetraquark condensate is not understood and work in this direction has recently been started  @xcite .    in  @xcite the implications of mixing between tetraquark and quarkonium fields on chiral phase transition is studied for zero baryon chemical potential .",
    "they favor the scenario where , @xmath0 is tetraquark dominated and the heavy @xmath6 is quarkonium dominated . according to their study , the order of the phase transition is strongly correlated with the extent of mixing between the two fields . for a weak coupling constant for the mixing term , a soft first order phase transition is obtained . on the other hand for a strong coupling constant for the mixing term give rise to a crossover transition .",
    "moreover , the most important and interesting result coming out from their study is that beyond a certain maximum temperature the nature of the heavy and lighter mesons is exchanged .",
    "the heavy @xmath6 becomes tetraquark dominated and the lighter @xmath0 turns into quarkonium dominated and becomes degenerate with the pion after the chiral symmetry restoring phase transition .",
    "whereas in  @xcite , an alternate breaking of chiral symmetry in dense matter was proposed .",
    "using ginzburg - landau effective potential consisting of two and four quark states they show in dense matter a possible phase may arise where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken but its center symmetry remains unbroken . in this phase conventional chiral condensate vanishes and",
    "the chiral symmetry breaking is due to the presence of quartic condensate .",
    "finally chiral symmetry is restored as quartic condensate also vanishes .",
    "existence of a tricritical point is also predicted between broken and unbroken center symmetric phase .",
    "thus in this scenario , restoration of chiral symmetry occurs in two steps .",
    "these studies warrant us to study the effect of mixing between the quarkonium and tetraquark condensates on the chiral phase transition in detail . here in this work ,",
    "we study two flavor chiral phase transition within the framework of extended linear sigma model taking into account both quarkonium and tetraquark effective fields .",
    "we fix parameters from the physical meson masses . depending on the possible values of the various parameters ,",
    "the resulting phase diagram is discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss about the model we are going to consider and how the various parameters in the model is fixed . in section iii we present our result and finally we summarize and conclude in the last section .",
    "we are going to investigate the effect of quarkonium and tetraquark mixing on chiral phase transition in the framework of quark - meson model . in this model , quarks propagate in the background potential of mesonic fields and interact with the vacuum expectation values of the scalar mean fields via yukawa coupling .",
    "the generic form of the lagrangian consist of a fermionic part ( @xmath8 ) and a mesonic field part ( @xmath9 ) and can be written as : @xmath10 with the mesonic part of the lagrangian : @xmath11 -h [ { \\rm tr } ( \\phi ) + h.c . ] .",

    "the mesonic lagrangian part has two effective fields : a @xmath15 matrix field @xmath16 which denotes the bare quarkonium field and a @xmath15 matrix field @xmath17 which denotes the bare tetraquark field . following the convention of the linear sigma model",
    ", we express the quarkonium and the tetraquark fields as : @xmath18 with @xmath19 ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) represents @xmath20 pauli matrix .",
    "the transformation properties of these fields under @xmath21 symmetry are defined as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are group elements of the @xmath21 symmetry .    the mesonic spectra consist of sixteen physical mesons : pair of scalar isoscalar @xmath24 , pair of pseudoscalar isoscalar @xmath25 , pair of scalar isovector @xmath26 and pair of pseudoscalar isovector @xmath27 . here , pseudoscalar isoscalar @xmath28 and @xmath29 mesons are composed of @xmath30 and @xmath31 quarks only .",
    "the bare quarkonium and tetraquark fields mixed with each other to give rise to physical mesonic fields : one of them being quarkonium dominated and the other tetraquark dominated mesons .    in the mesonic part lagrangian eq.([lagm ] ) , the cubic term for the tetraquark meson with the coupling constant @xmath32 , the mixing term between quarkonium and tetraquark with the coupling constant @xmath33 and the last term mimicking the finite quark mass for the quarkonium with coupling constant @xmath34 explicitly breaks the @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "whereas , the instanton determinant term explicitly break the axial @xmath35 symmetry .",
    "the other terms in the potential part of the lagrangian are invariant under @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "however , we spontaneously break the @xmath36 part of the symmetry of these terms as well by assuming vacuum expectation values for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 fields .",
    "the mass and the quartic interaction terms are the standard terms used in the linear @xmath2 model . an explicit symmetry breaking term to account for the finite quark mass and an instanton determinant term for the field @xmath16 are also used .",
    "the explicit chiral symmetry breaking terms for the field @xmath16 renders @xmath39 and @xmath40 massive .",
    "the instanton determinant term is responsible for the splitting of masses between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the choice of the cubic term is motivated from the study in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will investigate the chiral phase transition at the mean field level .",

    "where , @xmath2 and @xmath43 are the vacuum expectation values of the corresponding fields . keeping only the mean fields and integrating out the fermionic fields we obtain ( neglecting ultraviolet divergent vacuum energy term @xcite ) the expression for the thermodynamical potential at temperature @xmath44 and chemical potential @xmath45 as : @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 the single particle energy is given by @xmath48 and the constituent quark mass ( @xmath49 ) is given by @xmath50 .",

    "there are total 12 parameters in our model : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath33 , @xmath32 , @xmath58 , @xmath34 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and zero temperature values of @xmath2 , @xmath43 . out of these 12 parameters , the coupling constants",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 are from the fermionic part ( @xmath8 ) of the lagrangian and the other 10 are from the mesonic part ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the values of the 10 parameters in the mesonic part of the lagrangian are determined from the physical meson masses , the pion decay constant ( @xmath59 mev ) and two extremum conditions for the mesonic potential : @xmath60    values of the parameters so fixed are kept constant for the whole range of temperature and chemical potential .",

    "we see the symmetry breaking terms contribute towards its mass and the absence of those terms in our lagrangian would make pion massless .",
    "the same statement is also holds for the eta mesons although in this case there is mixing between quarkonium and tetraquark fields . in absence of mixing",

    "for this , in this case , we take the value of the physical meson masses slightly different from their real world values . to make comparison between the two scenarios meaningful ,",
    "we keep the physical meson masses for both the scenarios as close as possible ( see table  [ case1 in ] ) . in this case , the value of the parameters @xmath56 , @xmath33 and the zero temperature value of @xmath43 are calculated using the physical masses of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 mesons and the values of @xmath76 , @xmath55 are calculated using the extremum conditions for mesonic potential ( see eqn .",
