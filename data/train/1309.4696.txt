    "we apply the developed method to study the atomic contrast reversal on the fe(110 ) surface .    even in nonmagnetic stm , at certain bias voltage and",
    "tip - sample distance ranges , constant - current stm images can show atomic contrast inversion above flat metal surfaces , i.e. , the apparent height of surface atoms can be smaller than that of the surface hollow position , and consequently , atoms do not always appear as protrusions on the stm images .",
    "this phenomenon was widely studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "chen theoretically explained the corrugation inversion found on low miller index metal surfaces by the presence of @xmath0 tip states @xcite .",

    "@xcite highlighted the role of the real - space shape of the electron orbitals involved in the tunneling , including @xmath0 tip states .",
    "on the other hand , heinze et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a competition between electron states from different surface brillouin zone parts is responsible for the corrugation inversion effect .",
    "a similar explanation was given on the contrast inversion above the magnetic fe(001 ) surface in the presence of an external electric field @xcite .",
    "following the real - space electron orbital picture , we expect that beside orbital - dependent effects @xcite magnetic characteristics also play an important role in the determination of the corrugation quality of sp - stm images on magnetic surfaces .",
    "this expectation is supported by the reported bias voltage dependent magnetic contrast reversals in two different magnetic systems @xcite obtained by using spherical tunneling models .",
    "note that the magnetic effect can be tuned in different ways , e.g. , the magnetic contrast can be enhanced by properly adjusting the bias voltage and/or the tip magnetization direction @xcite , or by using chemically modified magnetic stm tips @xcite .    in the present work we report the formalism capable of studying the interplay of orbital - dependent and spin - polarized tunneling effects within the three - dimensional ( 3d ) wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) theory , and",

    "the @xmath85 ( 7 - 7 ) and @xmath86 ( 6 - 6 ) transitions also give sizeable contributions . the main difference between the t and h tip positions is that above the fe(110 ) hollow site the @xmath87 ( 6 - 7 and 7 - 6 ) contributions gain , while the @xmath85 ( 7 - 7 ) contribution loses weight , similarly to the finding above the w(110 ) surface @xcite .",
    "this is due to the different orientational overlap of the mentioned tip and sample orbitals at the two tip positions , and it is not affected by the bias voltage . on the other hand , at a larger negative bias @xmath5= -1.0 v [ figure [ fig3]c ) and [ fig3]d ) ] we observe that the tip @xmath78 ( 1 ) orbital loses and the @xmath83 ( 6 ) , @xmath84 ( 7 ) , and @xmath88 ( 8) orbitals and their tip - sample combinations gain weight .",
    "the largest contribution is now found for the @xmath85 ( 7 - 7 ) transition .",
    "we find an enhancement of this effect at @xmath5= -2.0 v [ figure [ fig3]e ) and [ fig3]f ) ] , and here the tip @xmath78 ( 1 ) orbital contributions are tiny .",
    "this bias - trend can be explained by the surface and tip partial charge pdos in figure [ fig2 ] . at large negative bias",
    "voltages the combination of the surface occupied @xmath77 partial pdos with the tip unoccupied @xmath77 partial pdos clearly dominates over the tip @xmath78 partial contributions .",
    "we find similar trends for a tip magnetization perpendicular to the surface , and also for positive bias voltages ( consider the combination of the surface unoccupied with the tip occupied @xmath77 partial charge pdos in figure [ fig2 ] ) .    as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the current difference between tip positions above the top ( t ) and hollow ( h ) surface sites is indicative for the corrugation character of a constant - current stm image .",
    "the total ( @xmath89 ) current difference at tip - sample distance @xmath55 and bias voltage @xmath5 is defined as @xmath90 positive @xmath91 corresponds to an stm image with normal corrugation where the atomic sites appear as protrusions , and negative @xmath91 to an inverted stm image with anticorrugation and atomic sites appearing as depressions .",
    "the @xmath92 contour gives the @xmath93 combinations where the corrugation inversion occurs .",

    "note that the validity of our tunneling model is restricted to about @xmath95  .",
    "let us first focus on the zero current difference contours obtained by the @xmath78-tip in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "the contrast inversion of the fe(110 ) surface with an @xmath78-tip at a fixed @xmath96  tip - sample distance was already studied with a different theoretical approach by heinze et al .  in ref .",
    "@xcite . comparing these results with ours",
    "we find good qualitative agreement : the p tip magnetization does not show any contrast inversion in the studied @xmath93 range .",
    "this corresponds to the majority spin@xmath97 data of fig .",
    "15 in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , the perp and ap tip magnetizations result in @xmath92 curves shifted away from each other , and the direction of the shift qualitatively agrees with the findings of ref .",
    "note , however , that the corrugation inversions at @xmath96 are found at different bias voltages : 0.87 v ( our model , perp ) vs.  0.4 v ( total , fig .  15 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and 0.94 v ( our model , ap ) vs.  0.7 v ( minority spin@xmath98 , fig .  15 in ref .",
    "this difference can be attributed to the nonequal lattice constants used and the different theoretical approaches .",
    "as a further test of the reliability of our tunneling model , we compared the @xmath92 contour using the perp tip magnetization with that obtained by the tersoff - hamann method , the curve denoted by t - h in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "we find that our model reproduces the @xmath93 region with the inverse corrugation denoted by the @xmath98 sign qualitatively well .",
    "quantitative agreement is not present due to the approximations in the 3d wkb method @xcite .",
    "note that the perp tip magnetization corresponds to an equal 0.5 - 0.5 weighting of the majority and minority spin channels contributing to the tunneling and , thus , to a zero spin - polarized ( @xmath99 ) contribution of the current ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , and solely orbital - dependent effects play a role in the tunneling without spin - polarization effects .",
    "altogether , the results obtained by the @xmath78-tip indicate that the fe(110 ) surface always appears to be normally corrugated taking a p tip magnetization with respect to the surface magnetic moment , whereas changing the tip magnetization to perp and ap result in anticorrugation below about 1 v bias and 6 tip - sample distance .    to understand these results , we give the following interpretation : it is known that there is a competition between the tunneling contributions from @xmath102 ( @xmath78 , @xmath94 , @xmath84 ) and @xmath0 orbitals in the formation of the corrugation character of an stm image @xcite .",
    "generally , @xmath102 states prefer normal corrugation , whereas @xmath0 states prefer anticorrugation . based on our model , we suggest that the corrugation inversion can be understood as an interplay of the real - space orbital shapes involved in the tunneling and their corresponding energy - dependent partial pdos . for the perp [ fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) ] and ap [ minority spin ( @xmath103 ) in fig .  [",
    "fig2]c ) ] cases the @xmath77 partial pdos of the fe(110 ) surface is dominating over the @xmath78 and @xmath79 partial pdos in the whole energy range . therefore ,",
    "considering only @xmath77 orbital shapes of the surface , the leading current contribution is expected from the @xmath84 orbital of the underlying fe atom when the tip is placed above the surface t position , and from the @xmath84 , @xmath104 orbitals of the four nearest - neighbor surface fe atoms when the tip is above the surface h position .",
    "note that the weight of @xmath83 is larger than of @xmath88 due to the geometry of the ( 110 ) surface , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . by changing the tip - sample distance",
    "there is a competition between the contributions of these @xmath77 states due to the orbital - dependent transmission in eq .",
    "[ eq_transmission_decomp ] , and there is a range ( @xmath105  ) where @xmath106 dominates over @xmath107 , thus anticorrugation is obtained . at large distances",
    "the @xmath104 orbitals lose and the @xmath84 orbital gains importance , and normal corrugation is found . this simple orbital - picture has to be combined with the energy - dependence of the pdos of the contributing spin channels for an accurate interpretation . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2]a ) and [ fig2]c ) ( @xmath103 ) , there is a large @xmath84-type pdos peak at about 1.5 ev above the fermi level .",
    "the existence of this pdos feature results in the disappearance of the anticorrugated region above around 1 v. note that although the @xmath88-type pdos is comparable in size with the @xmath84-type pdos in this energy range , the weighted contribution of @xmath88 orbitals is much smaller due to the orbital shapes and the tip - sample geometry . for the p tip magnetization , below the fermi level",
    "the orbital - shape - weighted contribution of @xmath84 is dominating compared to @xmath104 , for the pdos see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) ( @xmath80 ) . above the fermi level",
    "the importance of the @xmath77 states decreases rapidly , and concomitantly @xmath102 @xmath78 and @xmath94 states gain more importance , resulting in normal corrugation in the full energy and tip - sample distance range .",
    "comparing figs .",
    "[ fig4]a ) , [ fig4]b ) , and [ fig4]c ) we find that the anticorrugation regime is shifted to larger tip - sample distances following the order @xmath78 , @xmath94 , and @xmath84 , similarly as found for the w(110 ) surface @xcite .",
    "this is due to the increasingly localized character of these tip orbitals in the @xmath55-direction .",
    "it means that the dominating current contributions originate from less and less surface atoms that are located directly below the tip position . considering the orbital - dependent transmission in eq .",
    "[ eq_transmission_decomp ] and these @xmath55-localized ( @xmath102 ) tip orbitals , it follows naturally that the maximal effect of the surface @xmath104 orbitals preferring anticorrugation is found at larger tip - sample distances . on the other hand",
    ", there are certain energy regimes where this orbital overlap effect results in the occurrence of normal corrugation since the complex competition between @xmath104 and @xmath84 surface orbitals weighted with their partial pdos is won by the corrugating @xmath84 state .",
    "for all considered ideal magnetic tips the p tip magnetization corresponding to the majority spin channel does not show any contrast inversion in the studied @xmath93 range . taking the perp and ap tip magnetization directions we expect normal corrugation above approximately 1.0 v ( @xmath78-tip ) , 0.9 v ( @xmath94-tip ) , and 0.8 v ( @xmath84-tip ) irrespective of the tip - sample distance .",
    "the reasons are outlined above , and see the discussion for the @xmath78-tip .",
    "the series of figs .",
    "[ fig4]a ) , [ fig4]b ) , and [ fig4]c ) demonstrate the orbital - dependent tunneling and tip orbital effects on the corrugation inversion .",
    "taking the iron tip having all nine orbital characters with weighted energy - dependent pdos , it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d ) that the @xmath108 contours are considerably affected by the tip electronic structure .",
    "we find that all considered tip magnetization directions result in the appearance of corrugation inversions in the studied bias voltage and tip - sample distance range .",
    "close to the surface anticorrugation is observed for the same reason as discussed for the @xmath78-tip , with the exception of the approximate [ -1.7 v , -1.4 v ] range where the ap tip magnetization shows normal corrugation and no inversion at all .",
    "the reasons for this finding are the observed @xmath84 peaks in the surface majority spin ( @xmath80 ) pdos at around 1 ev and 1.5 ev below the sample fermi energy and the tip minority spin ( @xmath103 ) pdos at around 1.5 ev above the tip fermi level , see figs .",
    "[ fig2]c ) and [ fig2]d ) .",
    "such a combination of electronic structures gives a robust normal corrugation in the given bias range . by moving the tip away from the surface ,",
    "contrast inversions are indicated by the @xmath109 contours at large tip - sample distances , i.e. , the anticorrugation ( @xmath110 ) changes to normal corrugation ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that these inversion contours vary considerably depending on the tip magnetization orientation .",
    "this is due to the complex combined effect of the orbital - dependent tunneling and spin - polarization originating from the electronic structures of the sample surface and the tip .",
    "for instance , the minority spin ( @xmath103 ) @xmath112 pdos peak of the tip located at 0.5 ev below its fermi level in fig .  [ fig2]d ) is mainly responsible for the set of observed inversions at around 0.5 v bias .",
    "the @xmath112 tip orbital prefers normal corrugation in the studied tip - sample distance range due to its @xmath113 and @xmath114 nodal planes since above the h position the anticorrugating @xmath104 surface orbitals do not contribute to the current , and @xmath107 is expected to be larger than @xmath106 @xcite . considering other orbital contributions weighted with their partial pdos , however , results in anticorrugation below about @xmath115  . in effect , we point out that the complex interplay of the real - space orbital shapes and the energy - dependent pdos of the contributing spin channels of both the surface and the tip results in the observed corrugation inversion maps in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the above findings demonstrate the tunability of the height of the observable atomic contrast inversion depending on the spin - polarized tunneling via the tip magnetization orientation .        in order to show the dependence of the atomic contrast inversion on the tip - sample distance and on the tip magnetization orientation more apparently",
    ", constant - current sp - stm images are simulated .",
    "we choose the iron tip and the bias voltage of @xmath116 0.5 v. the total tunneling current ( @xmath117 ) is calculated in sheets of 0.01 vertical width centered at seven selected tip heights between 6 and 9.5 marked by crosses in fig .",

    "the apparent heights of the fe atom and the current values of the contours are given in the caption of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "going from the left to the right in figure [ fig5 ] , the current value is decreasing with a concomitant movement of the tip farther from the surface .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the contrast inversion occurs at different tip heights depending on the tip magnetization orientation : p , 6.37 (b ) ; perp , 7.28 (k ) ; ap , 9.12 (t ) , see also fig .",
