    "this admixture of quantum - mechanical , analytical and combinatorial features deserves a deeper study which we intend to pursue .",
    "our paper is partly expository in character , and has the following structure : first we establish a link between the mellin transform and the moment problem ; next , in section 3 , we provide principal solutions to two moment problems , termed toy models . in section 4 we discuss criteria for the uniqueness of solutions of the moment problem .",

    "the quest for non - unique solutions for @xmath6 is then well founded .",
    "we know of no general method to construct such solutions .",
    "however we have proposed a procedure based on the application of inverse mellin transform which generates the required solutions @xcite which we now briefly expose .",
    "the first step is to construct , within the framework of a given set of @xmath15 s , a family of functions @xmath78 , parametrized by a constant @xmath79 ( to be defined below ) , such that _ all _ their moments vanish , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath80 the mellin transform of @xmath78 , @xmath81 , vanishes for @xmath82 .",
    "such functions are orthogonal to all polynomials and play an important role in the study of integral transforms @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we choose a particular method of producing the functions @xmath83 : @xmath84 or equivalently @xmath85 where @xmath86 is any holomorphic function vanishing for @xmath82 . among an infinity of possible choices the simplest one is @xmath87 and it defines a discrete parameter @xmath88 .",

    "thus , the integral form of @xmath100 is @xmath101 whose evaluation requires a number of changes of variables as well as the use of formula 2.5.37.2 , p. 453 of vol.1 ref.@xcite , but is essentially elementary .",

    "( [ 20 ] ) is a positive function for @xmath31 which can not be represented by any other known special function .",
    "it possesses an infinite series representation in terms of polygamma functions , which we will not quote here .",
    "the carleman sum @xmath70 is convergent but the criterion c2 is not conclusive .",
    "only the criterion c3 permits to ascertain the non - uniqueness .",
    "the corresponding function @xmath118 is defined as @xmath119\\ ] ] which can be calculated as mellin convolution of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , see eqs .",
