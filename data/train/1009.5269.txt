    "the understanding of hadron properties from an underlying lagrangian or hamiltonian is a major issue in nuclear and particle physics .",
    "it demands both a relativistic framework to deal with quasi - massless particles ( the pion , up and down quarks , etc . ) or with high momentum and high energy experiments , and a nonperturbative framework .",
    "the latter is mandatory in order to calculate for instance the mass of a bound state from the pole of the scattering amplitude or from an eigenstate equation .",
    "one may already gain some physical insights from nonrelativistic studies like the nonrelativistic constituent quark model in particle physics , or the study of few - nucleon systems , based on the nonrelativistic nucleon - nucleon or three - nucleon potentials , in nuclear physics .",
    "this has given rise to numerous studies in the last 40 years .",
    "the extension to relativistic calculations may either rely on the use of relativistic equations like the four - dimensional bethe - salpeter equation ( including its various three - dimensional quasipotential reductions ) and the dyson - schwinger equation , or on hamiltonian dynamics , using one of its three forms proposed by dirac in 1949  @xcite .",
    "we shall follow in this review the path pointed out by dirac and choose light - front dynamics ( lfd ) as a basis of our approach .",
    "a natural testing ground for the use of lfd is the study of few - body systems .",
    "the properties of this particular form of dynamics are indeed very well - suited to make a tight connection with nonrelativistic considerations .    in the standard form of lfd",
    ", the state vector of a physical system is defined not at a fixed moment of time but on the light - front plane given by the equation @xmath2 . the nonrelativistic limit reached by taking @xmath3 leads thus naturally to the ordinary equal - time formulation @xmath4 , giving rise , in particular , to the schrdinger equation for the nonrelativistic wave function .",
    "one can always decompose the state vector in fock components .",
    "since the physical vacuum is trivial in lfd , i.e. it coincides with the vacuum for not interacting particles , this decomposition does not include the vacuum fluctuations but contains the physical states only .",
    "few - body systems are represented just by the first few components of this expansion . moreover",
    ", each fock component has a probabilistic interpretation similar to that of the nonrelativistic wave function .    in this formulation",
    ", the elementary kernel of the eigenstate equation defining the state vector of the physical system is calculated in light - front time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "all four - momenta are on the mass shell , while all intermediate states are off the energy shell .",
    "the eigenstate equation to be solved is then three - dimensional , in direct analogy with the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation .    according to the dirac s classification",
    ", the ten generators of the poincar group , given by space - time translations ( four generators ) , space rotations ( three generators ) , and lorentz boosts ( three generators ) , can be separated into kinematical and dynamical operators .",
    "the kinematical operators leave the light - front plane invariant and are independent of dynamics , i.e. of the interaction hamiltonian of the system , while the dynamical ones change the light - front position and depend therefore on the interaction . among the kinematical operators , one finds , in lfd , the boost along the @xmath5 axis .",
    "this property is of particular interest when one calculates electromagnetic observables at high momentum transfer , since once one knows the state vector in one reference frame , it is easy to calculate it in any other frame .",
    "one has of course to pay some price for that .",
    "the spatial rotations in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 planes become dynamical , in contrast to the case of equal - time dynamics .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the violation of rotational invariance caused by the non - invariant definition of the light - front plane orientation .",
    "this violation should be kept under control .",

    "the control of the violation of rotational symmetry is very difficult in practice , when using the standard form of lfd .",
    "to avoid such an unpleasant feature of the latter , we shall use below the covariant formulation of lfd ( clfd )  @xcite , which provides a simple , practical , and very powerful tool in order to describe physical systems as well as their electromagnetic amplitudes . in this formulation",
    ", the state vector is defined on the plane characterized by the invariant equation @xmath0{$\\cdot$}}x=0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is an arbitrary light - like ( @xmath8 ) four - vector .",
    "the standard lfd on the plane @xmath9 is recovered by considering the particular choice @xmath10 .",
    "the covariance of our approach relies on the invariance of the light - front plane equation under any lorentz transformation of both @xmath1 and @xmath11 .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath1 can not be kept the same in any reference frame , as it is the case in the standard formulation of lfd .",
    "there is of course equivalence , in principle , between the standard and covariant forms of lfd in any exact calculation . calculated physical observables must coincide in both approaches , though their derivation in clfd in most cases is much simpler and more transparent .",
    "indeed , the relation between clfd and standard lfd reminds that between the feynman graph technique and old - fashioned perturbation theory .",
    "in approximate calculations however , clfd has a definite advantage in the sense that it enables a direct handle on the contributions which violate rotational invariance .",
    "these ones depend explicitly on the orientation of the light - front surface ( i.e. on @xmath1 ) and can thus be separated covariantly from true physical contributions .",
    "this is of particular interest when one considers for instance electromagnetic observables in few - body systems  @xcite , or field theory on the light front .",
    "the interest to the application of lfd to field - theoretical problems is also very old .",
    "it originates from the study of deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that in this kinematical domain , all events are close to the light - front plane .",
    "this legitimates the use of the infinite momentum frame in the calculation of high energy observables  @xcite .",
    "the calculation is done in perturbation theory .",
    "the extension to qed is natural , since perturbation theory is also applicable in that case  @xcite .",
    "the use of lfd in field theory is important in order to extend these calculations to the nonperturbative domain  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the structure of the vacuum in lfd enables a well - defined expansion of the state vector in fock components . in field theory",
    ", this expansion is in principle infinite .",
    "from a practical point of view , it should be truncated to a limited number of components . we thus have to worry about the convergence of this expansion , and the various ways to speed it up if one wants to be able to make meaningful predictions .",
    "the truncation of the fock expansion induces however two pernicious features in the study of field theory on the light front .",
    "the first one , which we have already addressed in the discussion of few - body systems , is the violation of rotational invariance due to the particular choice of the orientation of the light - front plane .",
    "the second one is the appearance of uncancelled divergences which calls for an appropriate renormalization scheme .",

    "indeed , the full cancellation of field - theoretical divergences which appear in a given fock sector requires taking into account contributions from other sectors .",
    "if even a part of the latter is beyond our approximation , some divergences may leave uncancelled .    for instance , looking at fig .  [ self ] for the calculation of the fermion propagator in the second order of perturbation theory",
    ", one immediately realizes that the cancellation of divergences between the self - energy contribution ( of 2nd order in the fock decomposition ) and the fermion mass counterterm ( of 1st order one ) involves two different fock sectors .    .",
    "[ self ] ]    this means that , as a necessary condition for the cancellation of divergences , any mass counterterm should be associated with the number of particles present ( or `` in flight '' ) in a given fock sector .",
    "in other words , all mass counterterms must depend on the fock sector under consideration , as advocated first in ref .",
    "this is also true for the renormalization of the bare coupling constant .",
    "the presence of uncancelled divergences reflects itself in possible dependence of approximately calculated observables on the regularization parameters ( e.  g. , cutoffs ) .",
    "in other words , calculated physical observables are not anymore scale invariant .",
    "this prevents to make any physical predictions if we can not control the renormalization procedure in one way or another .",
    "we have developed an appropriate renormalization procedure  the so - called fock sector dependent renormalization ( fsdr ) scheme  in order to keep the cancellation of field - theoretical divergences under permanent control .",
    "this scheme relies also directly on clfd in order to define the renormalization conditions imposed on true physical observables  @xcite .",
    "we shall detail in the following the main features of clfd , as well as fsdr , and apply our general framework to various physical systems .",
    "the state vector , @xmath12 , of a compound system corresponds to definite values for its mass @xmath13 , its four - momentum @xmath14 , and its total angular momentum @xmath15 with the projection @xmath16 onto the @xmath5 axis in the rest frame , i.e. , the state vector forms a representation of the poincar group .",

    "@xmath33 _ satisfies eqs . _",
    "( [ kt14 ] ) _ and _  ( [ kt15 ] ) .",
    "the construction of the state vector of a physical system with definite total angular momentum becomes therefore _ a purely kinematical problem_. indeed , the transformation properties of the state vector under rotations of the coordinate system are fully determined by its total angular momentum , while the dynamical part of the latter is separated out by means of the angular condition .",
    "the dynamical dependence of the state vector on the light - front plane orientation turns now into its explicit dependence on the four - vector @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "such a separation , in a covariant way , of kinematical and dynamical transformations is a definite advantage of clfd , as compared to standard lfd .",
    "according to the general properties of lfd , we decompose the state vector of a physical system in fock sectors .",

    "in the standard renormalization theory , the bare parameters are determined by fixing some physical quantities like the particle masses and the physical coupling constants .",
    "the bare parameters are thus expressed through the physical ones .",
    "this identification implies in fact the following two important questions which are usually never clarified in lfd calculations , but are at the heart of our scheme .    _",
    "( i ) _ in order to express the bare parameters through the physical ones , and vice - versa , one should be able to calculate observables or , in other words , physical amplitudes . in lfd ,",
    "any physical amplitude is represented as a sum of partial contributions , each depending on the light - front plane orientation . since",
    "an observable quantity can not depend on the latter , this spurious dependence must cancel in the whole sum , as already mentioned .",
    "such a situation indeed takes place , for instance , in perturbation theory , provided the regularization of divergencies in lfd amplitudes is done in a rotationally invariant way  @xcite . in nonperturbative lfd calculations , which are always approximate",
    ", the dependence on the light - front plane orientation may survive even in calculated physical amplitudes .",
    "for this reason , the identification of such amplitudes with observable quantities becomes ambiguous and expressing the calculated amplitudes through the physical parameters turns into a non - trivial problem .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ the explicit form of the relationship between the bare and physical parameters depends on the approximation which is made .",
    "this is a trivial statement in perturbation theory where the order of approximation is distinctly determined by the power of the coupling constant . in our nonperturbative approach based on the truncated fock decomposition of the state vector , an analogous parameter ( the power of the coupling constant ) is absent . at the same time , to make calculations compatible with the order of truncation , one has to trace somehow the level of approximation .",
    "this implies that , on general grounds , the bare parameters should depend on the fock sector in which they are considered .",
    "moreover , this dependence must be such that all divergent contributions are cancelled , as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ deltam ] .",
    "how this should be done is the crucial point of the nonperturbative formulation of field theory on the light - front .",
    "the use of our fsdr scheme in clfd is a unique opportunity to answer both questions . for clarity , we shall take , as a background , a model of interacting fermions and bosons like the yukawa model or qed , with the aim to calculate the physical fermion state vector .",
    "the basis of fock space is formed by a set of fock sectors , each containing one constituent fermion and a certain number of bosons ( 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ) .",
    "the truncation is made by retaining only those fock sectors where the maximal total number of constituent particles does not exceed @xmath54 .",
    "the consideration of antiparticle degrees of freedom will be discussed in the simple case of a scalar model in sec .",
    "[ scalar ] .",
    "we will assume that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath23 is constructed through the bare fields satisfying the free dirac or klein - gordon equations with the corresponding _ physical _ masses , while the mass renormalization is performed by introducing , into @xmath23 , appropriate mass counterterms .",
    "we emphasize that in spite of that we consider hereafter several particular forms of interaction , our scheme is applicable to physical systems with arbitrary interaction admitting a fock decomposition of the state vector .",
    "the simple example of the renormalization of the fermion self - energy within the two - body fock space truncation , presented in sec .",
    "[ deltam ] , can serve as a guideline to set up our general rule . in this example",
    ", the mass counterterm should be labelled with a subscript and denoted by @xmath81 , in order to indicate that it is introduced to cancel , at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the constituent fermion mass , the self - energy contribution which belongs to the two - body fock sector .",
    "let us denote by @xmath84 the mass counterterm in the most general case . since we truncate our fock space to order @xmath54",
    ", one should make sure that , at any light - front time , the total number of particles is at most @xmath54 .",
    "our first rule is thus :    * _ in any amplitude where the mass counterterm @xmath85 appears , the value of @xmath86 is such that the total number of bosons in flight plus @xmath86 equals the maximal number of the fock sectors considered in the calculation , _ i.e. _ @xmath54 .",
    "_    for instance , in the typical contribution indicated in fig",
    ".  [ gammadeltan ] , the mass counterterm is @xmath87 .        for the mass counterterm of the lowest order",
    ", we simply have @xmath88 since the fermion mass is not renormalized at all if the fermion can not fluctuate in more than one particle !      the general strategy we developed above for the calculation of the mass counterterm should be also applied to the calculation of the bare coupling constant , with however a bit of caution , since this one may enter in two different types of contributions .",
    "the first one appears in the calculation of the state vector itself , when eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) is solved . in that case ,",
    "any boson - fermion coupling constant is associated with the emission or the absorption of a boson which participates in the particle counting , in accordance with the rules detailed above , since it is a part of the state vector .",
    "the second one appears in the calculation of the boson - fermion scattering amplitude or of the boson - fermion three - point green s function ( 3pgf ) like the electromagnetic form factor .",
    "since the external boson is an ( asymptotic ) free field rather than a part of the state vector , the particle counting rule advocated above should therefore not include the external boson line .",
    "following the same reasoning developed above for the calculation of mass counterterms , we can formulate the following general rule for the calculation of the bare coupling constants    * _ in any amplitude which couples constituents inside the state vector one should attach to each vertex the internal bare coupling constant @xmath89 .",
    "the value of @xmath86 is such that the total number of bosons in flight before ( after ) the vertex - if the latter corresponds to the boson emission ( absorption ) - plus @xmath86 equals the maximal number of the fock sectors considered in the calculation , it i.e. @xmath54 . _    the calculation of external bare coupling constants proceeds in the same spirit , with the final rule :    * _ in any amplitude which couples constituents of the state vector with an external field , one should attach to the vertex involving this external field the external bare coupling constant @xmath90 .",
    "the value of @xmath86 is such that , at the light - front time corresponding to the vertex , the total number of internal bosons in flight ( those emitted and absorbed by particles entering the state vector ) plus @xmath86 equals the maximal number of the fock sectors considered in the calculation , i.e. @xmath54 . _    the lowest order bare coupling constants are @xmath91 the first one is trivial , because no fermion - boson interaction is allowed in the one - body fock space truncation .",
    "the second one reflects the fact that the external bare coupling constant , in the same approximation , is not renormalized at all , since a single fermion can not be `` dressed '' .",
    "some illustrations of the rules concerning the internal and external bare coupling constants are given in fig .",
    "[ gammag0n ] .    ]",
    "though we relied on the fermion - boson model when considering the above fsdr procedure , the latter can be easily extended to other systems with additional counterterms and bare parameters .",
    "once proper bare coupling constants and mass counterterms have been identified , one should fix them from a set of renormalization conditions .",
    "in perturbation theory , there are three types of quantities to be determined : the mass counterterms , the bare coupling constants , and the norms of the fermion and boson fields .",
    "usually , the on - mass - shell renormalization is applied , with the following conditions . for each field ,",
    "the mass counterterm is fixed from the requirement that the corresponding two - point green s function has a pole at @xmath92 , where @xmath83 is the physical mass of the particle .",
    "the field normalization is fixed from the condition that the residue of the two - point green s function at the pole is @xmath93 .",
    "the bare coupling constant is determined by requiring that the on - mass - shell 3pgf is given by the product of the physical coupling constant and the elementary vertex .",
    "the renormalization conditions in lfd are of slightly different form , although they rely on the same grounds .",
    "the fermion mass counterterm is fixed from the eigenvalue equation  ( [ kt15 ] ) by demanding that the mass , @xmath13 , of the physical state is identical to the mass of the constituent fermion which we called @xmath83 .",
    "solving a similar equation for the physical boson state vector allows us to find the boson mass counterterm from quite analogous requirements .",
    "the determination of the internal bare coupling constant needs some care .",
    "it is found , as in perturbation theory , by relating the on - energy - shell two - body vertex function @xmath94 to the physical coupling constant @xmath95 . as follows from the momentum conservation law ,",
    "taking @xmath94 on the energy shell is equivalent to setting @xmath96 , or @xmath97 .    in order to fix the relationship between @xmath94 and @xmath95 one needs to take into account the renormalization factors coming from radiative corrections to all legs of the two - body vertex function  @xcite .",
    "these factors do also depend on the order of the fock space truncation , as detailed in  @xcite . in the case of a fermion coupled to bosons , without polarization effects generated by antifermion contributions",
    ", this relationship reads @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the one - body contribution to the norm of the state vector , as given in eq .",
    "( [ inor ] ) , calculated for the fock space truncation of order @xmath100 .",
    "( [ gamma2r ] ) admits simple physical interpretation .",
    "each leg of the on - energy - shell two - body vertex function contributes for an individual factor @xmath101 to the physical coupling constant , where @xmath102 is the field strength normalization factor  @xcite .",
    "the physical fermion state is normalized to @xmath93 , so that its factor @xmath102 equals @xmath93",
    ". the constituent boson line is not renormalized - since we do not consider antifermions - so that for the bosonic line we also have @xmath103 .",
    "if we did not neglect the antifermionic degrees of freedom , it would contribute by a non - unity factor @xmath104 .",
    "finally , we have shown in  @xcite that the field strength normalization factor of the constituent fermion is just the weight of the one - body component in the norm of the physical state , i.e. @xmath105 . according to our fsdr scheme , the normalization factor of the constituent fermion should correspond to the fock space truncation of order @xmath100 , since , by definition , the two - body vertex function contains one extra boson in flight in the final state .    the condition  ( [ gamma2r ] ) has two important consequences .",
    "the first one is that the two - body vertex function at @xmath106 should be independent of the four - vector @xmath1 which determines the orientation of the light - front plane . with the spin decomposition  ( [ onetwo ] ) , this implies that the component @xmath107 at @xmath106 should be identically zero . while this property is automatically verified in the case of the two - body fock space truncation - if using a regularization scheme which does not violate rotational invariance - this is not guaranteed for calculations within higher order truncations .",
    "indeed , nothing prevents @xmath94 to be @xmath1-dependent , since it is an off - shell object , but this dependence must completely disappear on the energy shell , i.e. for @xmath106",
    ". it would be so if no fock space truncation occurs .",
    "the latter , in approximations higher than the two - body one ( i.  e. for @xmath108 ) , may cause some @xmath1-dependence of @xmath94 even on the energy shell , which immediately makes the general renormalization condition  ( [ gamma2r ] ) ambiguous .",
    "if so , one has to insert new counterterms into the light - front interaction hamiltonian , which explicitly depend on @xmath1 and cancel the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath109 .",
    "note that the explicit covariance of clfd allows to separate the terms which depend on the light - front plane orientation ( i.e. on @xmath1 ) from other contributions and establish the structure of these counterterms .",

    "this is at variance with the meson sector for which a meaningful power expansion of any physical amplitude can be done .    while there is not much freedom , thanks to chiral symmetry , for the construction of the effective lagrangian in chiral perturbation theory in terms of the pion field  or more precisely in terms of the u field defined by @xmath247 , where @xmath248 is the pion decay constant and @xmath249 are the pauli matrices ,  one should settle an appropriate approximation scheme in order to calculate baryon properties . up to now , two main strategies have been adopted .",
    "the first one is to force the bare ( and hence the physical ) nucleon mass to be infinite , in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite . in this case , by construction , an expansion in characteristic momenta can be developed .",
    "the second one is to use a specific regularization scheme  @xcite in order to separate contributions which exhibit a meaningful power expansion , and hide the other parts in appropriate counterterms . in both cases",
    "however , the explicit calculation of baryon properties relies on an extra approximation in the sense that physical amplitudes are further calculated by expanding the effective lagrangian , denoted by @xmath250 , in a finite number of pion fields .    moreover , it has recently been realized that the contribution of pion - nucleon resonances , like the @xmath251 and roper resonances , may play an important role in the understanding of the nucleon properties at low energies  @xcite .",
    "these resonances are just added `` by hand '' in the chiral effective lagrangian .",
    "this is also the case for the most important @xmath252 resonances , like the @xmath16 and @xmath253 resonances .",
    "since in the chiral limit the pion mass is zero , any calculation of @xmath254 systems demands a relativistic framework to get , for instance , the right analytical properties of the physical amplitudes .",
    "the calculation of compound systems , like a physical nucleon composed of a bare nucleon coupled to many pions , relies also on a nonperturbative eigenstate equation . while the mass of the system can be determined in leading order from the iteration of the @xmath254 self - energy calculated in the first order of perturbation theory , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ self_gen](a ) , this is in general not possible , in particular , for @xmath254 irreducible contributions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ self_gen](b ) .    ]    the general framework we have developed above is particularly suited to deal with these requirements .",
    "this leads to the formulation of light - front chiral effective field theory ( lf@xmath255eft )  @xcite with a specific effective lagrangian @xmath256 .",
    "the decomposition of the state vector in a finite number of fock components implies to consider an effective lagrangian which enables all possible elementary couplings between the pion and nucleon fields compatible with the fock space truncation .",
    "this is indeed easy to achieve in chiral perturbation theory , since each derivative of the u field involves one derivative of the pion field . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the chiral effective lagrangian of order @xmath14 , @xmath257 , involves @xmath14 derivatives and therefore at least @xmath14 degrees of the pion field . in order to calculate the state vector in the @xmath54-body approximation , with one fermion and @xmath258 pions",
    ", one has therefore to include contributions up to @xmath259 pion fields in the effective lagrangian , as shown in fig .",
    "[ counting ] .",
    "we thus should calculate the state vector in the @xmath54-body approximation with an effective lagrangian denoted by @xmath260 and given by @xmath261     pion fields in the initial and final states . [ counting ] ]",
    "while the effective lagrangian in lf@xmath255eft can be mapped out to the cpt lagrangian of order @xmath14 , the calculation of the state vector does not rely on any momentum decomposition .",
    "it relies only on an expansion in the number of pions in flight at a given light - front time . in other words , it relies on an expansion in the fluctuation time , @xmath262 , of such a contribution . from general arguments , the more particles we have at a given light - front time , the smaller the fluctuation time is . at low energies ,",
    "when all processes have characteristic interaction times larger than @xmath262 , this expansion should be meaningful .",
    "it is interesting to illustrate the general features of lf@xmath255eft calculations . at order @xmath154",
    ", we already have to deal with irreducible contributions , as shown in fig .  [ self_gen](b ) .",
    "it leads to non - trivial renormalization of the coupling constant .",
    "the calculation at order @xmath189 incorporates explicitly contributions coming from @xmath263 interactions , as well as all low energy @xmath254 resonances , like the @xmath251 or roper resonances , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ delta ] ) . indeed , in the @xmath264 fock sector , the @xmath254 state can couple to both @xmath265 as well as @xmath266 states .",
    "we can generate therefore all @xmath254 resonances in the intermediate state without the need to include them explicitly , provided the effective lagrangian has the right dynamics to generate these resonances .",
    "this is the case , by the construction , in cpt .",
    "resonances and @xmath251 as well as roper nucleon resonances . [ delta ] ]    preliminary results obtained by using the pv regularization scheme can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the properties of relativistic compound systems from an elementary hamiltonian in nuclear and particle physics demands to develop a nonperturbative framework .",
    "this framework should include a well - defined strategy for approximate calculations of these properties and a systematic way to improve the accuracy .",
    "we have described in this review a general framework based on light - front dynamics . in this scheme ,",
    "the state vector of any system of interacting particles is decomposed in fock components . since for obvious practical reasons this decomposition should be truncated to take into account a finite number of fock components ,",
    "we have shown how to control in a systematic way the convergence of such expansion .",
    "our formalism relies , first , on the covariant formulation of light - front dynamics , and , second , on a systematic nonperturbative renormalization scheme in order to avoid any uncancelled divergences .",
    "the applications we have presented on qed , on a purely scalar system , on the yukawa model , and on chiral effective field theory on the light - front have shown the flexibility , the real advantages , and the nice features of our formalism .",
    "several developments will soon achieve to settle a complete framework to deal with field theory on the light front .",
    "this includes first the full account of antiparticle degrees of freedom in order to recover , order by order in the fock expansion , the scale invariance of physical observables for arbitrary values of the coupling constant .",
    "this scale invariance should be checked within a given regularization scheme .",
    "we have used up to now the pauli - villars regularization scheme . while this scheme is systematic and",
    "can be applied to a variety of physical systems , it may be cumbersome to implement from a numerical point of view in higher order calculations , since it involves many non - physical components including pauli - villars fields .",
    "it also demands to perform calculations with very large mass scales ( the pauli - villars fermion and boson masses ) .",
    "the use of the taylor - lagrange renormalization scheme  @xcite has proven to be a very natural scheme in light - front dynamics .",
    "it should be applied to more involved calculations .",
    "finally , it is now well - recognized that the understanding of spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena on the light - front can be achieved by taking into account nonperturbative zero mode contributions to field operators  @xcite .",
    "it remains to include these zero modes in the general framework we developed in this review .",
