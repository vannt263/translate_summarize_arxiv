    "nearly 500 extrasolar planets in over 400 planetary systems have been discovered , and yet @xmath2 per cent of those with known or estimated host star masses are m dwarf planetary systems . since m dwarf masses may be as low as one tenth of a solar mass , it is not unreasonable to expect that their most massive planets might also be correspondingly smaller @xcite and thus more difficult to detect than the ubiquitous gas giants found orbiting f , g & k dwarf stars . on the other hand , planets of a fixed mass orbiting",
    "lower mass stars become easier to detect , owing to the reduced mass ratio of the system . detecting low - mass planets ( which are predicted in significant numbers by @xcite )",
    "is however no easy task , since the planet - induced stellar velocity amplitudes are small , even for m dwarfs .",
    "additionally , in the case of m dwarfs , there is an observational bias against detecting planets at optical wavelengths ( where most searches have so far been carried out ) owing to the relatively low fluxes compared with redder wavelengths .",
    "observations carried out at near infrared wavelengths , where the host m stars are several magnitudes brighter than at shorter wavelengths , open up the possibility of carrying out larger surveys of lower mass stars that are capable of detecting low - mass planets .",
    "radial velocity surveys are still by far the most successful means of detecting planets . despite the difficulties of observing in the infrared ,",
    "there are a number of fledgling projects aimed at carrying out planet searches .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite showed that high precision ( @xmath3 ) radial velocity measurements could be made at short infrared wavelengths via observations of the sun .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that similar precision was possible on short timescales using the cryogenic high - resolution infrared chelle spectrograph ( crires ) , operating at l - band wavelengths , at the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "more recently , an ammonia gas cell has been employed to achieve @xmath4  precision @xcite over six month timescales with crires operating at k - band wavelengths .",
    "this survey @xcite has not found evidence for the massive planet claimed to be orbiting the low - mass m dwarf vb 10 @xcite .    with infrared multi - order spectrographs working at high resolution , precision radial velocities of order 1",
    "are expected to be achieved in the next few years .",
    "instrumental precision of 1  is a desirable goal when we consider that a  planet orbiting in the _ habitable zone _ of 0.1  star induces a @xmath5  radial velocity amplitude . @xcite",
    "have nevertheless already estimated  radial velocity jitter for the m4 dwarf , gj 876 ( at optical wavelengths ) .",
    "a major cause of radial velocity jitter is the presence of magnetic activity induced starspots that distort absorption line profiles @xcite .",
    "any time variant asymmetries in line profiles due to starspots will lead to biased measurements of dynamically induced radial velocities from orbiting bodies such as planets .",
    "if the radial velocity signal of a planet is of similar magnitude or smaller than spot induced jitter , any candidate planet signal may not be recovered with reasonable allocations of observing time . in this paper , we simulate semi - realistic starspot patterns for m dwarfs . by making use of starspot size distribution models for the sun and by considering indirectly observed starspot distribution patterns for m dwarf stars , we model the subsequent line profiles from which radial velocity jitter is determined via cross - correlation .",
    "this approach extends similar work carried out by @xcite and @xcite to more realistic spot distributions that are solar spot distributions extrapolated to active stars .",
    "the method is more analogous to the recent work by @xcite that investigates the effect that solar sunspot activity would have on detection thresholds of an earth - like planet orbiting in the habitable zone . here",
    ", we use our models to determine the detection thresholds for earth mass habitable zone planets orbiting m dwarf stars that exhibit different equatorial rotation velocities and starspot activity levels . in  [ section : modelling_detecting ] we discuss evidence for m dwarf starspot distributions and introduce our extrapolated solar model . in  [ section : synthetic_data ] , we briefly describe the methods used to generate line profiles .",
    "a comparison of the relative spot amplitudes for different photosphere - to - spot temperature contrast ratios ( ) is made in ",
    "[ section : optical_ir ] .",
    "the radial velocities induced by stars that exhibit the spot distributions introduced in  [ section : modellingspots ] are then investigated in  [ section : radvels ] . here",
    ", we investigate the effects of spots for three stellar masses at extremes of the expected  values .",
    "we then carry out detection threshold simulations for earth - mass planets in ",
    "[ section : detection ] before finally considering possibilities that generalise our specific model cases further in  [ section : discussion ] .",
    "[ section : modelling_detecting ]      [ section : observedspots ] compared with earlier spectral types , our knowledge of starspot distribution patterns on m dwarfs is less complete . for earlier spectral types , publications that predict and report observations of these distributions are numerous .",
    "the solar analogue is our chief reference point for which we observe spots appearing chiefly at 0@xmath6 - 40@xmath6  latitudes .",
    "there is also considerable evidence that other stars exhibit similar starspot activity to the sun .",
    "observations made by the mount wilson survey @xcite , which has observed changes in the rotation periods of a number of stars over decades @xcite , suggests that similar magnetic dynamo processes are at work .",
    "the appearance of spots within defined ( low ) latitude bands has been attributed to the interface dynamo process by which the magnetic fields responsible for the spots are generated .",
    "a magnetic dynamo located at the boundary between the radiative core and convection zone together with radial transport of flux through convection , is able to explain the appearance of photospheric flux at low - mid latitudes only @xcite . for more rapidly rotating stars which can be indirectly imaged via the doppler imaging process , this scenario @xcite is less successful at predicting the starspot distributions @xcite .",
    "however spots still often appear within specific latitude regions in doppler images .",
    "ccc   &   &   +   +   &   &   +    [ set4t7 ]    unlike g and k stars , owing largely to their inherent faintness , m dwarfs are less well studied . by mid - m , it is predicted that stars become fully convective and thus the standard @xmath7 interface dynamo process can no longer operate .",
    "there is nevertheless a great deal of evidence indicating that fully convective m dwarf stars are magnetically active .",
    "a study by @xcite found that the percentage of objects with h@xmath8  appearing in emission peaks at late spectral type while @xcite found that the equatorial rotation velocity at which h@xmath8  activity saturates appears at higher values for mid - late m spectral types than for early - mid m spectral types .",
    "this was however later ruled out by @xcite .",
    "the topic is too large to review at length here where we are concerned primarily with starspot distributions .",
    "observations of rapidly rotating early m - dwarfs via indirect doppler imaging techniques @xcite reveal that they are more uniformly covered with spots than earlier spectral types . @xcite and @xcite have found , via magnetic doppler imaging using stokes v measurements , that the magnetic topology of m dwarfs change at approximately spectral type m4v . although a switch to a fully convective dynamo might be expected to lead to a more uniformly spotted star , the results of @xcite and @xcite appear to counter - intuitively indicate that fields become more dipolar .",
    "this phenomenon has also been investigated by @xcite who find that in fact more than 85 per cent of the magnetic flux is stored in magnetic fields that are invisible to stokes v. however , using all stokes components is necessary for a full description of a star s magnetic topology .",
    "additionally , the field from the darkest magnetic regions ( e.g. spots ) is not visible in stokes v owing to the large contrast seen at optical wavelengths .",
    "the high average fields of a few kg found on m dwarfs @xcite are unlikely to be concentrated in small spots because very high local fields would be necessary .",
    "they are perhaps evenly distributed across the surfaces of the stars . the traditional picture of spots as the only concentrations of magnetic flux may therefore be misleading in these stars .",
    "it is thus clear that neither magnetic imaging nor surface brightness imaging at optical wavelengths are able to give a complete picture of the starspot / magnetic field topology of stars .    while starspot patterns ( e.g. the latitudes at which spots appear ) on more rapidly rotating g and k stars may vary as a function of rotation , it is not clear whether such changes take place among _ fully convective _ m dwarf stars that are expected to generate magnetic fields via a turbulent dynamo process",
    ". hence those surface brightness images derived for m dwarfs @xcite may also be representative of slower rotators .",
    "moreover , at later spectral types , m7-m9.5 for example , @xcite find no correlation between rotation and magnetic flux generation .",
    "further evidence that starspots may be more uniformly distributed comes from observations of reduced starspot induced lightcurve variability .",
    "@xcite have shown that already by spectral type k6-m4 , the maximum starspot induced photometric variability is around a factor of 2 lower .",
    "other individual studies of mid - m and late - m ( m5 & m9 ) dwarfs @xcite also show peak - to - peak amplitudes of order 0.05 or less in g , r and i photometric bands",
    ". a more uniform distribution of spots ( rather than clustering of spots in one or two active regions ) would be one explanation for the observed reduction in photometric induced light variations in m dwarf stars .    a series of investigations into spot coverage factors ( @xcite , 1998 & 2004 )",
    "have been carried out using tio as a tracer of cooler temperatures on g & k stars of different spectral class , including dwarfs .",
    "these studies , indicate typical spot coverage of 20 - 50 per cent for active stars .",
    "this may seem surprising , but indicates that lightcurve analyses and doppler imaging studies ( that typically find of order 10 per cent spot coverage ) are not sensitive to an underlying spot distribution .",
    "it is again unclear whether these spots arise from a boundary dynamo or whether a turbulent dynamo is responsible .",
    "based on these findings , investigations of high levels of spot coverage seem warranted .",
    "a threshold level of spot coverage may be expected ( for uniform spot coverage ) at which any radial velocity jitter effects no longer increase in magnitude .    with a largely unknown starspot pattern in moderately rotating m dwarfs and the general prediction that a distributed dynamo should produce randomly distributed spots , we carry out a number of simulations to assess the detectability of planets around m stars . without strong evidence to the contrary",
    ", we assume that more rapidly rotating stars are more spotted .",
    "synthetic starspot models are used to generate line profiles and to investigate the radial velocity amplitudes resulting from non - uniform line profiles .",
    "these radial velocities are then used to determine our ability to detect low - mass planets which are in habitable zone orbits around m dwarf stars .",

    "we also noted in  3.3 ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) that the jitter is greatest for the 0.2  model with low spot contrast spots . as a result , in this scenario",
    ", our model predicts that detection of a planet orbiting a 0.5  star becomes easier than for a planet orbiting a 0.2  star .    the global trend seen in figs .",
    "5 - 7 continues in fig .",
    "[ fig : planet_sim4 ] , where only the most massive planets may be detected for very active stars .",
    "if the spot filling factors of up to 50 per cent , reported at earlier spectral types for stars rotating with @xmath15 20  @xcite are to be found in m dwarfs , then a lower planet detection limit of order 1 neptune mass may be expected . by 50 ( not shown ) ,",
    "only 20  planets may be detected in orbit around a 0.1  star with low contrast spots ( model 6 ) in less than 100 epochs of observations ( for model 4 , only @xmath1910  planets may similarly be detected in @xmath20 epochs ) .",
    "[ section : detectability ]    we have demonstrated how the relative contrast ratio , @xmath21 is an important factor that determines the detectability of planets , particularly when spot activity dominates the jitter .",
    "however , it must also be realised that the observing strategy simulated in this paper will determine the detectability of planets . in particular",
    ", the orbital period of the planet may be either somewhat shorter , or longer than the span of the observations .",
    "table 2 indicates that the orbital periods of the simulated habitable zone planets are @xmath15 5 , 13 & 36 days for 0.1 , 0.2 & 0.5 stars respectively .",
    "hence , detection of a periodic signal on timescales shorter than the period is less likely .",
    "in other words , it should be easier to detect habitable zone planets orbiting lower mass stars owing to the shorter periods .",
    "since we only simulate a minimum of 10 epochs , this mostly applies only to the 36 day period experienced by a planet orbiting a 0.5  star . it can be seen from figs .",
    "5 - 8 that no planets are detected in orbit about a 0.5  star until over half the period has been sampled . therefore",
    "if trageting such stars for habitable zone planets , a different observing strategy would be needed to minimise the number of observation epochs .",
    "in reality , a radial velocity survey would wish to search for planets with a range of orbital radii and periods , especially as shorter period planets are more likely to be detected .",
    "the effect of activity on the number of epochs required to detect a planet can also be assessed by completely removing the starspot jitter from all simulations . in our low activity simulation ( vsini = 2 instrumental precision of 1.5  and model 2 starspot coverage ) , removing the starspot activity does not have any significant effect on the detection curves plotted in fig .",
    "this has already been discussed in the preceding section and is a consequence of the instrumental precision at this rotation velocity ( and implied instrumental precision ) dominating the jitter .",
    "the effect of removing spot activity from the simulations presented in figs .",
    "6 - 8 however leads to significant changes in the number of epochs necessary for detection , as might be expected . in our most extreme scenario simulated in fig .",
    "8 ( high contrast ) , although no planets are detected , complete removal of the starspot jitter leaves a 6  precision floor due to the rotation velocity of  = 20 . here ,",
    "planets of 5 - 20  may then be detected with 300 - 40 epochs respectively .",
    "[ section : discussion ]     we have used more realistic starspot models than previous studies to determine the effect of activity induced jitter in precision radial velocity studies of m dwarf stars .",
    "we have demonstrated that with only several tens of epochs , habitable zone earth - mass planets can be detected around low - activity stars .",
    "since the contrast ratio between photosphere and spots is uncertain , we opted to simulate two extreme cases . in reality",
    ", the true contrast ratio likely falls between the two extreme cases simulated .",
    "@xcite required temperature differences of only a few hundred k in order to fit their lightcurves of m5v & m9v stars .",
    "however , their modelling assumed only a single spot was present . a more uniformly spotted surface , especially if highly spotted could produce a similar lightcurve but would be expected to require a higher contrast between photosphere and spot to achieve the same photometric amplitude .    the factors that determine the starspot induced jitter have important consequences for the estimated detection threshold limits .",
    "in agreement with other studies @xcite we showed ( fig .",
    "1 ) that once the contrast ratio between spot and photosphere is sufficiently high , the improvement in jitter , when moving from v - band to y - band , is less impressive . in this case , the spots are simply dark enough that the radial jitter does not show such a strong decrease with increasing wavelength .",
    "conversely , the decrease in jitter as a function of increasing wavelength is much more pronounced at lower contrast ratios . at low contrast , the exact normalised line strengths and relative line strengths of the photosphere and spot play an important role in determining the exact relative jitter at different wavelengths .",
    "this additional factor leads to the irregularity in relative rv amplitudes as a function of increasing @xmath22 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 ( see  3.2 ) . although we do not show the full jitter amplitude ratio for other photometric bands , fig .",
    "2 ( top ) for @xmath23 k indicates that the relationship between wavelength and jitter is not as straightforward as a simple blackbody model might suggest .",
    "further estimates of the wavelength dependence of jitter may be obtained by observation of the results of @xcite who plot rv amplitude as a function of wavelength for the 5000 -18000   range ( their fig .",
    "12 ) . at longer wavelengths than y band ,",
    "equivalent width effects at low photosphere / spot contrast apart , there is little further gain in precision .",
    "a further important consideration is the number of lines available for cross - correlation , which may be fewer at longer wavelengths .",
    "we have assumed that activity scales with rotation @xcite so that less spotted stars are slow rotators and more spotted stars are fast rotators .",
    "however , as discussed in  [ section : observedspots ] , @xcite find that the relation between rotation and activity is weaker in m dwarfs .",
    "knowledge of the true spottedness of these stars is clearly vital for an accurate estimation of the detectability limits for low mass planets orbiting the lowest mass m dwarfs .",
    "in addition , spot coverage derived from other spectroscopic methods using temperature sensitive ( tio ) lines @xcite indicate that there may be large discrepancies with results from doppler images . for active stars ,",
    "up to @xmath15 50 per cent spot coverage has been derived using the tio method , while doppler images of similar stars typically derive @xmath3 per cent coverage .",
    "the difference between these methods is that the tio procedure derives an unresolved mean spot coverage while the doppler imaging results are limited by the amount of resolvable information in the broadened rotation profile of the star .",
    "it seems likely that active stars are therefore more spotted than doppler images show , and that they possibly exhibit smaller spots than are derived via this method . in summary ,",
    "high spectral resolution doppler imaging surveys ( in the red - optical or infrared ) , possibly combined with other global spot coverage surveys are needed for a more accurate picture of spot patterns on mid - late m dwarfs .",
    "it is clear that there are many physical factors that will determine the true detection threshold for planets orbiting m dwarfs ; we have only simulated planets in circular orbits for instance .",
    "@xcite simulated planet scattering and found that for low mass stars only , planets with long circularisation times on eccentric orbits could form .",
    "although we have not simulated the effects of eccentricity in full , we have already noted that in extreme cases , detection thresholds will be raised and more observations will be required @xcite .",
    "we find that for longitude of periastron , @xmath24@xmath6 ,  = 10  ( instrumental precision = 3 ) , the number of nights required to make a detection increases by approximately 2 - 2.5 times for eccentricity , @xmath25 and by @xmath4 times for @xmath26 .    in this paper , we have shown that earth - mass or near earth - mass planets in the habitable zones of late - mid m dwarfs can be detected when the number of starspots matches those seen on the sun at extremes of activity .",
    "moderate rotation quickly increases the number of observations that are required to make a detection such that by the time  = 10 , @xmath27 observations are required to detect planets with masses @xmath0 5 .",
    "variations in  and contrast ratio are therefore important factors in particular in determining the detection thresholds . given the evidence for a general increase in  with decreasing mass @xcite among m dwarfs ,",
    "the balance of these factors may be important .",
    "obtaining estimates of starspot coverage from further modelling and photometric observations will provide vital information that will enable a link between starspots and more traditional chromospheric activity indicators @xcite to be made .",
