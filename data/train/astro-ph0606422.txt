    "2005 ) , less than one giga  year after recombination , implies that galactic scale ( @xmath1210kpc ) , gravitationally bound structures exist at this early epoch .",
    "the study of the masses and dynamical state of these young systems serves as a direct constraint to the models describing the growth of large scale structures since the epoch of recombination .",
    "studies of the molecular and dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) in these galaxies are of fundamental importance , since it is this medium out of which stars form ; accurate determination of the molecular gas mass may therefore serve as an indicator of the evolutionary state of a galaxy .",
    "the detection of carbon monoxide ( co ) is also a strong confirmation that star formation is going on in some of the highest redshift systems .",
    "in fact , the combination of molecular gas and dust detections with large far  infrared ( fir ) luminosities provides the strongest evidence that a significant fraction of high@xmath8 galaxies is undergoing starbursts at prodigious rates ( @xmath13m@xmath14 ) , consistent with the formation of a large elliptical galaxy on a dynamical timescale of @xmath1210@xmath1510@xmath16yr .    over the past decade , more than 30 galaxies at @xmath17 have been detected in co emission ( solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) out to a redshift of @xmath18 ( walter et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ; bertoldi et al.2003 ) , confirming the presence of intense starbursts in numerous high@xmath8 galaxies .",
    "as most of these observations were obtained using millimeter interferometers , these detections were typically achieved by observing high@xmath10 co(@xmath19 ) transitions ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "although these high@xmath10 lines exhibit in general higher peak flux densities than the ground  state ( @xmath21 ) transition , it is possible that the higher order transitions are biased to the excited gas close to a central starburst and do not necessarily trace the entire molecular gas reservoir seen in . also , the conversion factor ( @xmath22 ) to derive molecular ( h@xmath5 ) masses from measured co luminosities has mostly been estimated for the  line ( e.g. , downes & solomon 1998 ; weiss et al .",
    "observing  has the additional advantage that properties of the highly redshifted sources can be _ directly _ compared to the molecular gas properties of nearby ( starburst ) galaxies which are predominantly mapped in the  transition .",
    "these are main motivations for observing the  ground  state transition .",
    "however , due to the faintness of the line and the bandwidth limitations of current radio telescopes , such high@xmath8  observations only exist for two qsos and two radio galaxies to date .",
    "all of these observations have been obtained with radio interferometers operating at centimeter wavelengths  the nrao very large array ( vla ; papadopoulos et al .",

    "in particular , due to the bandwidth limitations of the vla , obtaining better constraints on the spectral line shape and total flux of the  transition is desirable even for already detected sources . today",
    "s largest single dish telescopes , such as the nrao green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the mpifr effelsberg telescope , can eliminate some of those issues due to their larger spectral bandwidths .    here",

    "the predicted lvg integrated flux ranges of the  transition are 0.100.12jy  ( br1202 - 0725 ) , 0.200.23jy ( pssj2322 + 1944 ) , and 0.130.20jy  ( apm08279 + 5255 ) and are in good agreement with our observations for all sources . as described in sect .  3.2.2 , the observed  linewidth in our new observations and in the vla spectrum ( carilli et al .",
    "2002a ) of pssj2322 + 1944 is lower than that of the higher@xmath10 transitions , thus the integrated model fluxes are a bit higher than our result .",
    "if we compare the peak fluxes only , we obtain a good agreement .",
    "our observations and models are in agreement with the assertion that _ all _ observed  flux density is associated with the highly excited molecular gas seen in the high@xmath10 co lines .",
    "we thus find no evidence for an additional luminous , more extended low surface brightness gas component surrounding the central region of our target qsos , in contrast to what has been suggested previously for apm08279 + 5255 ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2001 ) . given the accuracy of our measurements , we conclude that at most 2030% of the luminosity may be associated with such a diffuse component .",
    "we note however that , if the @xmath42 to @xmath51 conversion factor ( @xmath22 ) for a faint extended component were higher ( e.g.  galactic ) , a higher h@xmath5 mass may be hidden in such an extended component .      co results for our three high  redshift ir  luminous qsos are summarized in tab .  [ tab-03 ] and [ tab-04 ] .",
    "our sample consists of all three high@xmath8 qsos for which the co ground  state transition has been detected to date , and covers @xmath1220% of the co  detected @xmath17 quasars . as discussed above",
    ", the  transition provides the best information of the total amount of molecular gas in a system , quantified by @xmath96 . for most qsos / galaxies detected in co at high @xmath8 ,  and  are the lowest transitions that have been detected to date .",
    "based on our results in the previous paragraph , however , we can now estimate their @xmath96 by assuming constant brightness temperature for all transitions from  to  ( i.e. , @xmath42 is the same for those transitions ) .",
    "this assumption is also in agreement with observations towards the radio galaxy 4c60.07 ( greve et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , it is important to note that all high@xmath8 sources were selected via higher@xmath10 co transitions , which could , in principle , introduce a bias towards highly excitated starburst environments .    following sanders et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , gao & solomon ( 2004 ) found a non  linear relation between the logarithms of the fir luminosity @xmath97 and the  line luminosity @xmath42 for a sample of local spiral galaxies , luminous , and ultra  luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "their sample consists mostly of galaxies whose fir luminosity is powered by star formation only .",
    "our  observations and lvg models suggest that @xmath42 can be estimated for all co  detected high@xmath8 sources with some degree of confidence , even if only observations of higher@xmath10 co transitions exist for most of these sources . to put this result into context",
    ", we now aim to discuss the @xmath42@xmath97 relation and its implications for some selected samples of galaxies at low and high redshift .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the relationship between log(@xmath97 ) and log(@xmath42 ) for our three targets , all other high@xmath8 co detections ( except tnj0924 - 2201 , which does not have a measured fir luminosity ) , the @xmath98 palomar  green ( pg ) qsos from alloin et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , and the local galaxy sample ( @xmath100 ) of gao & solomon ( 2004 ) .",
    "all fir luminosities for the high@xmath8 sources are re  derived as described by carilli et al .",
    "( 2005 ) unless stated otherwise .",
    "lensing magnification factors were taken into account .",
    "in addition , data for the milky way disk ( fixsen et al .",
    "1999 ) and an ( extrapolated ) relation for galactic molecular clouds ( mooney & solomon 1988 ) are given for comparison .",
    "the solid line is a straight  line least squares fit to the gao & solomon ( 2004 ) sample , corresponding to log@xmath101 ( the power law index is 1.25 @xmath40 0.08 in the original publication ) .",
    "fitting the high@xmath8 sources , the gao & solomon ( 2004 ) data , the solomon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ulirgs , and the pg qsos together , we find the relation log@xmath102 .",
    "both relations are clearly non  linear , as their power  law indexes are significantly larger than unity ( see also the corresponding discussion in gao & solomon 2004 ) . we recover a schmidt  kennicutt law ( power law index of 1.4 , kennicutt 1998a , b ) for the larger , more heterogenous sample .",
    "more importantly , the high@xmath8 sources seem to follow the same slope ( within the errors ) as seen at low @xmath8 , even though most high@xmath8 sources harbor central agns .",
    "in addition , the high@xmath8 qsos and high@xmath8 sub  millimeter and radio galaxies ( likely lacking a luminous agn ) statistically occupy the same area in the plot .",
    "the same behaviour is found for the pg qsos in comparison to the low@xmath8 spirals / lirgs / ulirgs .",
    "it is in general not clear that the fir emission comes mostly from star ",
    "formation , i.e.  that it is not strongly biased by active nuclei or the interstellar radiation field .",
    "e.g. , sed modeling of the @xmath103 quasar h1413 + 117 ( the cloverleaf ) reveals that only @xmath1220% of its fir luminosity is powered by star formation ( solomon et al .",
    "2003 ) , but it is not an outlier in the @xmath42@xmath97 diagram . in this context , the elevated @xmath97/@xmath42 ratio in apm08279 + 5255 may be explained by a combination of differential lensing and a relatively high contribution of the agn to @xmath97 ( see rowan ",
    "robinson 2000 for models of the ir sed ) .",
    "outliers like apm08279 + 5255 are also found at low @xmath8 ( e.g.  the qso pds456 and the warm ulirg iras08572 + 3915 , see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) . as the relative number of such outliers is very small ,",
    "this may also be explained by a brief fir ",
    "bright agn phase ( yun et al .  2004 ) .",
    "however , it is likely that the dominant energy source in most ulirgs is an extreme starburst rather than heating by a dust  enshrouded agn ( e.g. , solomon et al.1997 ; downes & solomon 1998 ) .",
    "this picture is supported by the finding that ulirgs harbor large quantities of _ dense _ molecular gas , which is more intimately involved with star formation than the major fraction of the mostly diffuse co ( gao & solomon 2004 ) .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that the high@xmath8 sources are highly selected , and probably fulfill the malmquist bias ( i.e. , the apparent increase in the average @xmath42 and @xmath97 towards high redshift is probably a consequence of the flux limitation in the sample , e.g.sandage 1994 ) .",
    "as an additional consequence of flux limitation in the sample , lensing influences the results ( i.e. , stronger lensing magnification allows to probe deeper , and therefore the intrinsic co luminosity drops ) .    we can also set an approximate lower limit on the duration of the intense starburst phase . considering the total h@xmath5 masses and star  formation rates in table [ tab-04 ] ,",
    "the depletion timescale of the molecular gas is of order 10@xmath15yr for all three qsos under the assumption of a constant sfr and 100% star ",
    "forming efficiency .",
    "this implies that the starburst itself can be relatively short  lived , ( and compact , as the dynamical time must be less than the starburst lifetime ) unless the molecular gas in which the star  formation occurs can be re ",
    "supplied on timescales of @xmath104yr .",
    "we have detected  emission in three qsos at redshifts @xmath105 with the nrao gbt and the mpifr effelsberg telescope . from our analysis of the resulting spectra of br1202 - 0725 ,",
    "pss2322 + 1944 , and apm08279 + 5255 , we obtain the following results : + 1 .",
    "we derived lensing  corrected  line luminosities of @xmath106k pc@xmath4 for br1202 - 0725 , @xmath63k pc@xmath4 for pss2322 + 1944 , and @xmath107k pc@xmath4 for apm08279 + 5255 .",
    "these results are in good agreement ( within a factor of 2 ) with previous estimates of the total co luminosities based on the higher@xmath10 co transitions , consistently providing very large @xmath51 of @xmath108m@xmath7 .",
    "fluxes predicted by one  component lvg models are in good agreement with our observations . considering our modeling results",
    ", the co emission appears to be close to thermalized up to the 4@xmath803 transition in all cases .",
    "thus , our observations show no indication of a luminous extended , low surface brightness molecular gas component in any of the high  redshift qsos in our sample ( cf .",
    "papadopoulos et al .",
    "in fact , all co transitions are described very well by a single gas component where all molecular gas is concentrated in a compact circumnuclear region .",
    "if such extended components were to exist , our observations and models limit their contribution to the overall luminosity to at most 2030% .",
    "log(@xmath97 ) and log(@xmath42 ) appear to be correlated for low  redshift galaxies over orders of magnitude in @xmath97 including ( u)lirgs , and the significantly brighter sources found at high@xmath8 appear to follow the same general trend ( see also solomon & vanden bout 2005 ) .",
    "in particular , we find that the correlation shows no significant difference between qsos and systems without a luminous agn",
