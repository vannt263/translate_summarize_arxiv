    "the high temperature surface properties of alkali halide crystals , particularly of nacl , are very unusual as these solids are incompletely wetted by _ their own _ melt .",
    "@xcite we investigated theoretically these surfaces and their uncommon behavior , with a multiple goal .",
    "the first goal was to uncover the physical reasons for the poor wetting .",
    "the second was to exploit the availability of the standard empirical potential parametrized long ago by tosi and fumi ( bmhft ) for a first quantitative characterization of all the interfaces  and particularly their structure and their temperature dependent interface free energies  in a well defined solid - liquid - vapor system . achieving this kind of goal is of particular interest in the general context of high temperature capillarity , a field where such a detailed understanding is usually unavailable .",
    "a third goal was to verify whether the solid nacl(100 ) surface exhibits surface non - melting , as the partial self - wetting would imply on thermodynamic grounds .",
    "a fourth goal was to study the nacl liquid surface , extracting from its temperature dependent surface tension the surface entropy , and comparing it .",
    "e.g. , with the solid surface entropy at the melting point .",
    "again , it seems that this comparison is generally unavailable . a fifth and more practical type of goal was finally to put to use the understanding obtained for the non - melting solid surface , in the field of nanofriction . in particular",
    ", our aim is to provide a first theory and simulation approach to both _ ploughing _ and _ grazing _ friction of hard nanotips on a solid surface near melting .    in the following",
    "we summarize the results of work that appeared in refs .",
    "our classical molecular dynamics simulations with the tosi - fumi potentials confirm that in this model crystalline nacl(100 ) is only partly wetted by a ( nano )  droplet of molten nacl .",
    "@xcite moreover , as expected , solid nacl(100 ) is confirmed to be a non - melting surface , stable without any precursor signals of melting up to the bulk melting point . in a metastable state , and in the absence of defects , it can even be overheated by as much as 100k above the melting temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . extracting from the simulations the properties of the three interfaces",
    " solid - vapor , liquid - vapor , and solid - liquid  we calculated and analyzed their free energies ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) and found that the surface non - melting of nacl(100 ) and the resulting partial self - wetting stem from three separate reasons :    * solid nacl(100 ) is an exceptionally stable solid surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , with a strongly decreasing surface free energy at high temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "stability in this regime is enhanced by extremely large anharmonicities . at the melting point",
    "@xmath0 , we found @xmath1  103  mj / m@xmath2 .",
    "* the solid - liquid interface is spatially sharp ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , and is energetically very expensive ( @xmath3  36  mj / m@xmath2 ) .",
    "this can be attributed to large structural differences between solid and liquid , in particular a 27% density difference between the two . *",
    "the liquid - vapor interface free energy ( surface tension ) is relatively high ( @xmath4  102  mj / m@xmath2 ) , actually almost identical to the solid - vapor free energy at the melting point .",
    "the reason for this high surface tension is traced to a surprising _ deficit _ of liquid surface entropy , which we calculate to be a factor @xmath52.5 _ lower _ than that of the solid surface .",
    "low entropy implies some kind of short range order at the molten salt surface .",
    "we highlighted and characterized in particular an incipient pairwise molecular charge order in the outermost regions of the molten salt surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the unusual stability of the alkali halide surface against melting suggests adopting it as a natural toy system for the study of high temperature afm tip - surface nanofriction studies .",
    "a non - melting surface will not automatically liquefy under a tip , ( as would instead be the case for a regular , melting surface  @xcite ) even at temperatures very close to bulk melting .",
    "for this reason , nacl(100 ) and other alkali halide surfaces should provide good testing grounds for a first study of high temperature nanofriction , a potentially important area which is still largely unexplored . in the absence of any experimental data on high temperature nanofriction",
    ", we conducted exploratory molecular dynamics sliding friction simulations of hard ( diamond ) tips on nacl(100 ) , both in the heavy ploughing , wear - dominated regime , and in the light grazing , wearless regime .",
    "the simulated ploughing friction of a sharp penetrating tip is very large , as expected for scratching a hard solid ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "however , it shows as a function of temperature a strong drop near the melting point .",
    "this high temperature friction decrease can be assimilated to _ skating _ of the tip over the hot solid . as in ice skating ,",
    "the tip is surrounded by a local liquid halo , moving along with the tip as it ploughs on .",
    "@xcite    at the opposite extreme , we found that simulated grazing friction of a hard flat tip over nacl(100 ) behaves just the other way around ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . unlike ploughing , low temperature grazing friction is initially very small , on account of the incommensurability of the two respective lattice planes . upon heating",
    "however the grazing friction surges just near the melting point .",
    "this rise is seen as the analog of the celebrated _ peak effect _ in the critical current close to the upper critical field in the mixed state of type ii superconductors . the dramatic softening of the flux lattice just before its disappearance causes a sudden increase of sliding friction of fluxons against the pinning impurities .",
    "@xcite in our case the softening of the nacl surface lattice , still solid at the melting temperature , reflects in an increase of sliding friction just before spontaneous breakdown of the solid surface above the melting point .",
    "this contrasting behavior of friction close to the melting point  skating when scratching , braking when grazing  should be more general than the specific instance of nacl(100 ) where we uncovered them .",
    "metals in particular usually possess at least one close packed non - melting surface  @xcite such as the ( 111 ) or the ( 110 ) surfaces of _ fcc _ or _ bcc _ metals respectively , which is non - melting and should behave similarly to nacl(100 ) .",
    "we moreover can expect possible modifications of the high temperature nanofriction behavior by adhesive forces between tip and surface , as well as by application of a bias between ( conducting ) tips and surfaces .",
    "this work was sponsored by miur and cofin 2006022847 , as well as by infm ( iniziativa trasversale calcolo parallelo ) .",
