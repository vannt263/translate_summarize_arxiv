    "the last few decades have witnessed enormous research in the field of low - dimensional quantum magnets.@xcite model compounds especially with a gap in the excitation spectrum are extensively pursued .",
    "spin gap is found in many low - dimensional quantum spin systems .",
    "some examples include spin dimers,@xcite integer spin chains,@xcite even leg spin ladders,@xcite alternating spin chains,@xcite spin - peierls compounds,@xcite etc .",
    "spin dimers are the simplest magnetic clusters , comprising of unified pair of magnetic ions , coupled antiferromagnetically . such systems are characterized by a gap in their excitation spectrum and the energy difference between excited triplet states ( @xmath8 ) and singlet ground state ( @xmath9 ) constitutes the spin gap .",
    "recently , many new magnetic materials composed of antiferromagnetic spin dimers have been discovered .",
    "because of different inter - dimer exchange networks , a variety of magnetic excitations have been observed under external magnetic field .",
    "bose - einstein - condensation ( bec ) of magnons in bacusi@xmath0o@xmath10 , tlcucl@xmath11 , ( ba , sr)@xmath11cr@xmath0o@xmath12 , nicl@xmath0 - 4sc(nh@xmath0)@xmath0 etc@xcite , magnetization plateaus in ba@xmath11mn@xmath0o@xmath12,[ref .  ] and magnetization plateaus and wigner crystallization of magnons in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath11)@xmath0[ref .  ] are the best known examples .",
    "these discoveries have accelerated the search for new spin dimer compounds and interesting quantum phenomena .    unlike the inorganic materials ( as discussed above ) ,",
    "the metal - organic compounds are not explored well despite being easier to synthesize . in magnetically active metal - organic systems , the organic moieties bond the metal ions in a wide variety of forms leading to structurally and magnetically diverse systems.@xcite we have recently demonstrated that the organic moieties can modulate both the structural and magnetic features between metal ions significantly as the organic ligand nipa leads to the formation of a hourglass nanomagnet cu@xmath13(nipa)@xmath14(oh)@xmath0.11h@xmath0o with two antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and one ferromagnetic ( fm ) couplings between cu@xmath2 ions@xcite while another similar ligand leads to the formation of a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) afm with weakly anisotropic spin-@xmath4 square lattice.@xcite cu(1,3-@xmath15 ) is another well studied compound where cu@xmath2 ions are connected via ipa forming a perfect kagom@xmath16 lattice with strong magnetic frustration.@xcite it undergoes a magnetic long - range - order ( lro ) at @xmath17  k. we have reported that in such kagom@xmath16 lattices by changing the ligand it is possible to tune the magnetic ground state keeping the crystal structure intact.@xcite thus , the organic ligands play a vital role in stabilizing different ground states in the metal - organic complexes .    herein , we report synthesis , crystal structure , and magnetic properties of a new spin-@xmath4 compound cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) [ ipa = isophthalic acid and dmf = dimethyl formamide ] .",
    "cu@xmath2 ions in the compound form spin dimers which are weakly coupled via long ligands .",
    "our magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed an activated behavior at low temperatures with a large spin gap of @xmath6  k.    -plane showing interconnecting and orthogonal network of cu@xmath2 dimers in the crystal structure of cu@xmath18(ipa)@xmath18(dmf)(h@xmath18o ) .",
    "since the dmf and h@xmath18o molecules are not involved in the interaction path , we have removed them for clarity.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "all the reagent quality chemicals were obtained from sigma - aldrich and used without further purification .",
    "single crystals of cu@xmath18(ipa)@xmath18(dmf)(h@xmath18o ) were prepared by the hydrothermal route . in this process , an aqueous solution of cu(no@xmath19)@xmath18.3h@xmath18o ( 0.5 mm , 0.12 g ) was mixed with same equivalent of isopthalic ( 1,3-benzenedicarboxylic ) acid ( 0.5 mm , 0.08 g ) in 10 ml of dmf .",
    "the mixture was heated at 90 @xmath20c in a 25 ml teflon capped autoclave .",
    "big plate like blue crystals were collected from the walls of the vial after 3 days .",
    "the crystals after washing in water and acetone and then drying in air were found to be the phase pure form of cu@xmath18(ipa)@xmath18(dmf)(h@xmath18o ) .",
    "the yield was 72.6% ( based on cu ) .",
    "single - crystal x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed using a bruker apex - ii diffractometer ( mok@xmath21 radiation with wavelength @xmath22   ) on a good - quality single crystal of cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) at room temperature and the crystal structure was solved .",
    "the phase purity of crystals was also confirmed through powder xrd performed on the crushed powder sample at room temperature using a panalytical ( cu@xmath23 radiation , @xmath24   ) powder diffractometer .",
    "magnetic susceptibility @xmath25 was measured as a function of temperature ( 2  k  @xmath26  380  k ) using the vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) attachment to the physical property measurement system [ ppms , quantum design ] .",
    "for high temperature measurements ( @xmath27  k ) , a high-@xmath28 oven ( model cm - c - vsm ) was attached to the vsm .",
    "our measurements were done upto 500  k , above which the sample was found to be decomposed . from the thermo gravity analysis ,",
    "the decomposition temperature was indeed confirmed to be @xmath29  k. heat capacity , @xmath30 was also measured using heat capacity option of the ppms on a small piece of sintered pellet , adopting relaxation technique .",

    "crystal structure of cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) was solved from single crystal xrd .",
    "it crystallizes in a orthorhombic structure with space group @xmath1 .",
    "the obtained structural parameters are tabulated in table  [ structure ] and  [ atomic ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows projection of the crystal structure in the @xmath31-plane obtained from the single crystal xrd .",
    "it consists of paddle wheel like units , each containing two closely held cu@xmath2 ions . in each paddle wheel ,",
    "cu@xmath2 ions are coupled via o - c - o path forming a spin dimer .",
    "it is to be noted that there are three inequivalent cu sites [ cu(1 ) , cu(2 ) , and cu(3 ) ] in the crystal structure which form two different dimers ( type 1 and type 2 ) .",
    "the intra - dimer distances are cu(1)-cu(2 )  @xmath32  and cu(3)-cu(3 )  @xmath33  for type 1 and type 2 dimers , respectively .",
    "each dimer is connected to the adjacent dimers through the organic ligand ( isophthalic acid , ipa ) leading to either a coupled dimer or a quasi-2d layered structure in the @xmath31-plane .",
    "the dimers are of course far apart ( @xmath34   ) from each other where the inter - dimer interaction would be almost negligible compared to the intra - dimer interaction .",
    "interestingly , in each layer the type 1 and type 2 dimers are aligned nearly perpendicular to each other .",
    "these 2d layers are well separated along the crystallographic @xmath35-direction .",
    ".crystal structure data of cu@xmath18(ipa)@xmath18(dmf)(h@xmath18o ) obtained from single crystal xrd experiment at room temperature . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      the heat capacity @xmath7 of cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) is measured as a function of temperature at zero applied field in the temperature range from 2  k to 90  k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "no indication of magnetic lro was observed down to 2  k , which is in accordance with our @xmath3 data . in a magnetic insulator",
    ", @xmath30 has two major contributions : one due to phonon excitations and the other due to magnetic part . we refrained from doing any quantitative analysis of the @xmath7 data since it was not possible to subtract the phonon contribution without a non - magnetic analogue compound .",
    "we have synthesized a novel paddle - wheel type cu@xmath2 spin-@xmath4 dimer compound cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) and investigated its crystal structure and magnetic properties .",
    "it crystallizes in an orthorhombic ( @xmath1 ) crystal structure .",
    "analysis of @xmath3 revealed dimer model for the spin lattice with a large spin gap of @xmath6  k. the paramagnetic impurity concentration was estimated to be @xmath36% which is likely due to defects present in the sample .",
    "no signature of magnetic lro was observed down to 2  k from the @xmath30 data , further supporting the gapped behaviour . in magnetic insulators ,",
    "strongest super - exchange interaction between magnetic ions is usually expected via non - magnetic ions such as oxygen.@xcite however , in our compound , despite having a long and complex interaction path cu - o - c - o - cu , the intra - dimer interaction is surprisingly very large . for a comparison",
    ", the highest value of spin gap is found to be reported for srcu@xmath0o@xmath11 ( @xmath37  k)@xcite among the inorganic compounds and for cu(ipa)(h@xmath18o ) ( @xmath38  k ) among the metal - organic compounds.@xcite thus , the value of spin gap found for cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) is nearly same in magnitude to the highest values reported so far .    as pointed out earlier",
    ", the crystal structure contains quasi-2d layers of orthogonal cu@xmath2 dimers .",
    "such a crystal lattice is reminiscent of the magnetic sub - lattice reported for srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath11)@xmath0 where wigner crystallization of magnons and magnetization plateaus were observed in an applied magnetic field.@xcite thus , a large spin gap and orthogonal arrangement of dimers in the 2d layer make cu@xmath0(ipa)@xmath0(dmf)(h@xmath0o ) a unique system for further investigations .",
    "furthermore , the value of spin gap is very sensitive to the inter - dimer couplings which tend to reduce the spin gap and heavily affect the properties under high magnetic field . in such a context , this compound serves as a starting point to synthesize further new compounds where one can tune the spin gap simply by changing the organic ligand .",
    "we would like to acknowledge iiser thiruvananthapuram for providing necessary experimental facilities .",
