    "conformal field theories ( cfts ) with large @xmath1 structure are quite important since they can be utilized to investigate holographic dual gravity theory among others . in particular , cfts with higher spin symmetry broken in @xmath2 are useful to examine symmetry breaking in dual higher spin gauge theories . in @xcite , the critical o@xmath0 scalar model and the gross - neveu model @xcite in @xmath6 dimensions were studied , and the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in these models were reproduced by applying the method of conformal perturbation theory .",
    "a famous example of higher spin gauge theory on ads space is given by vasiliev theory @xcite , and the two models are supposed to be holographic dual to the type a and type b vasiliev theories @xcite .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents correspond to the masses of higher spin fields , and the cft computation in the conformal perturbation theory was interpreted from the bulk theory in terms of witten diagrams .",
    "this paper addresses a continuation of these works .",
    "higher spin gauge theory is expected to describe superstring theory in the tensionless limit @xcite , and turning on string tension should correspond to breaking higher spin gauge symmetry . in @xcite ,",
    "the double - trace type deformations of free o(@xmath1 ) bosons and free u(@xmath1 ) fermions were examined , but there are only two fixed points , where one of them is free and the other is interacting with higher spin symmetry broken in @xmath2 . since the string tension is a parameter of theory , it should be mapped to a marginal deformation of cft dual to higher spin gauge theory .",
    "therefore it is better to work on a model which has higher spin dual and admits marginal deformations . as a simple example , we examine @xmath7 supersymmetic u@xmath0 model with @xmath1 free complex scalars and fermions in three dimensions .",
    "the model is proposed to be dual to a supersymmetric vasiliev theory on ads@xmath8 @xcite , and it admits deformations exactly marginal at least to the @xmath2 order .",
    "we compute the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents in the deformations of supersymmetric model to the @xmath2 order but to all orders in deformation parameters mainly with the help of conformal perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , we interpret the cft computation in terms of bulk higher spin theory .",
    "let us denote @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 as the free complex bosons and fermions in the supersymmetric model .",
    "a marginal deformation of the theory is given by @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the scalar operators are dual to bulk scalar fields , and the deformation corresponds to mixing the boundary conditions of these scalars @xcite . higher spin symmetry is broken with non - zero @xmath15 , and the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents are obtained to the @xmath2 order but to all orders in @xmath15 , see below .",
    "there is another type of marginal deformation as @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the fermionic operators are dual to bulk fermionic fields , and the deformation corresponds to mixing the boundary conditions of these spinors .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents are computed to the @xmath2 order but to all orders in @xmath19 , see below .",
    "higher order corrections in @xmath19 are examined in a different method as used in @xcite for the gross - neveu model in @xmath2-expansion .",
    "the method is enough to obtain the all order expression of anomalous dimensions .",
    "however , it is suitable to use the conformal perturbation theory if one wants to relate with dual higher spin theory .",
    "[ muta ] ] we can include both the deformations simultaneously , and supersymmetry is preserved when @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the conformal perturbation theory to compute the anomalous dimensions , which enables us to borrow the previous results in @xcite . the main reason to use the method",
    "is that the cft computation can be understood in terms of bulk theory .",
    "the relation is known between the masses of higher spin fields and the anomalous dimensions of dual higher spin currents , which may be read off from two point function of the currents .",
    "the two point function is computable from the bulk theory through witten diagrams and the contributions to anomalous dimensions arise from loop diagrams as in figure [ 2pt ] .",
    "however , the bulk one - loop computation is notoriously difficult in higher spin gauge theory as is well known for gravity theory with spin two gauge field .    in @xcite ( based on a previous work in @xcite )",
    "the difficulty is evaded by utilizing the witten s argument in @xcite that deforming boundary theory by double - trace type operators is dual to changing the boundary condition of dual bulk fields .",
    "once we admit the dictionary , the diagram with modified bulk - to - bulk propagators along the loop can be rewritten as a product of tree diagrams only with bulk - to - boundary propagators and boundary two point functions as in figure [ 2ptmod ] .",
    "furthermore , we can see that the bulk computation with tree witten diagrams is equivalent to the boundary one in the conformal perturbation theory to the @xmath2 order .",
    "therefore , what we have to do is proving that the modification of bulk - to - bulk propagators can be written only in terms of bulk - to - boundary operators and boundary two point functions without relying the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "this was already done for the bulk scalar fields in @xcite .",
    "for the holography with 3d o@xmath0 scalars , it was applied in @xcite , and the same idea was already proposed in @xcite . in this paper , we first repeat the analysis of @xcite in a slightly different way , and then apply the modified method to the case with bulk spinor fields .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows ; in the next section , we introduce the supersymmetric model with free bosons and fermions , and write down our notation for higher spin currents .",
    "then we explain how to read off the anomalous dimensions form two point functions of higher spin currents in conformal perturbation theory . in section",
    "[ sec : boson ] , we compute the anomalous dimensions in the presence of deformation .",
    "we first obtain them to the @xmath21 order and then incorporate higher order corrections . in subsection [ aux ] , we re - examine the model in the formulation with auxiliary fields . in section [ sec : fermion ] , we study the case with another marginal deformation . in section [ bulk ] , we derive the map from the one - loop diagram as in figure [ 2pt ] to a product of tree witten diagrams as in figure [ 2ptmod ] .",

    "we read off them from the two point functions of higher spin currents by using the modified correlators as in . in the current case , there are two types of higher spin currents , and we would meet a diagonalization problem to obtain the anomalous dimensions , see , e.g. , @xcite . denoting two independent linear combinations as @xmath48 with @xmath49 ,",

    "<S> the 3d field theory is supposed to be dual to 4d supersymmetric vasiliev theory , and the marginal deformations are argued to correspond to modifying boundary conditions for bulk scalars and fermions . thus the modification should break higher spin gauge symmetry and generate the masses of higher spin fields . </S>",
    "<S> we provide supports for the dual interpretation by relating bulk computation in terms of witten diagrams to boundary one in conformal perturbation theory .    </S>",
