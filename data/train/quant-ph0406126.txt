    "during the past several years , the global positioning system ( gps ) has practically become a household word .",
    "the gps is a u.s .",
    "department of defense satellite system that is used by both the military and civilians for navigation and time dissemination@xcite .",
    "automobile , ship , aircraft , and spacecraft use the gps for navigation .",
    "telephone and computer network systems that require precise time use the gps for time synchronization .",
    "the gps is a complex system consisting  of approximately 24 satellites orbiting the earth in circular orbits at approximately 4.25 earth radii .",
    "the gps is designed so that signals travel line - of - site from satellite to user , and from any place on earth at least four satellites are in view .",
    "if a user receives four gps satellite signals simultaneously from four satellites ,  @xmath0 ,  and the satellites space - time coordinates @xmath1 at time of transmission are known ,  the user can solve for his unknown space - time coordinates , @xmath2 , by solving the four equations@xcite @xmath3 in eq.([gpslightcones ] ) we assume that the signals travel on four light cones that are centered at the reception event and we have ignored atmospheric delays .",
    "the actual signals that the gps satellites transmit are continuous - wave circularly polarized radio - frequency signals on two carrier frequencies in the l - band centered about : @xmath4 mhz and @xmath5 mhz .",
    "the carrier frequency signals are modulated by a pseudorandom noise ( prn ) code .",
    "a gps  receiver makes a phase difference measurement , called a _",
    "pseudorange measurement _ , which is the phase difference between the prn code received from the satellite and an identical copy of the prn code that is replicated inside the gps  receiver ,  see ref.@xcite for details of the gps pseudorange measurement process .",
    "the pseudorange measurement is essentially made by performing a correlation of the code bits in the prn code received from the satellite with an identical copy of the same prn code replicated inside the gps receiver .",
    "recently , there have been several proposals for synchronizing clocks by making use of entangled quantum systems@xcite .",
    "the question naturally arises whether entangled quantum systems can be exploited to determine all four space - time coordinates of a user , rather than just time .    in this article ,",
    "i describe a quantum positioning system ( qps ) that is in - principle capable of providing a user with all four of his space - time coordinates .",
    "this qps  is the quantum analog of the classical gps described above .",
    "the qps is based on entangled photon pairs ( biphotons ) and second order correlations within each pair .",
    "the two - photon coincidence counting  rate is the basic measured quantity .  in order to determine his four space - time coordinates",
    ", a user of the qps must carry a corner cube reflector , a good clock , and have a two - way classical channel for communication with the origin of the reference frame .",
    "for simplicity of discussion , i assume that space - time is flat with minkowski@xcite coordinates @xmath6 and that the user of the qps is stationary .",
    "the complete qps consists of four biphoton sources ( entangled photon pairs ) , four beam splitters and four two - photon coincidence counting hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interferometers , see figure 1 .",
    "three of the interferometers are used together to solve for the user s position and one interferometer is used to solve for the user s time , in a particular reference frame .",
    "six spatial points ,  @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , for @xmath9 , define the spatial part of the reference frame at constant coordinate time @xmath10 .  the six points  @xmath7 define three independent baselines in pairs , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "the points  @xmath7 are assumed to be accurately surveyed , so their coordinates are precisely known .",
    "determination of a user s spatial coordinates ,  @xmath14 , is done with respect to this reference frame .",
    "a stationary clock in this reference frame , say at the origin of coordinates , @xmath15 , provides a measure of coordinate time @xmath10 in this 4-dimensional system of coordinates .",
    "we neglect all gravitational effects@xcite so that the user s clock , which keeps proper time @xmath16 , runs at the same rate as coordinate time @xmath10 in the reference frame defined by the spatial points @xmath7 , so that @xmath17  .",
    "synchronization of the user s clock to coordinate time@xcite means that we have a method to compute the integration constant @xmath18 in @xmath19 .  in four dimensional flat space - time , the world lines of the spatial points @xmath7 define a tube .",
    "events that are simultaneous in this system of 4-dimensional coordinates occur at constant values of coordinate time @xmath10 , which is a hyperplane that cuts this tube .",
    "there are several possible modes for the qps .",
    "first , consider a user that must determine all four of his space - time coordinates @xmath20 .",
    "in a previous paper@xcite , an algorithm has been given to synchronize the proper time @xmath16 on a user s clock to coordinate time , @xmath10 , without prior knowledge of the geometric range from the reference clock ( which keeps coordinate time @xmath10 ) to the user clock .",
    "we assume that this algorithm is employed here to synchronize the user s clock with coordinate time @xmath10 .",
    "this algorithm requires a two - way classical channel of communication between the user and the reference frame origin , where coordinate time @xmath10 is kept .",
    "the three spatial coordinates are determined separately as follows , refer to figure 1 .",
    "each baseline , such as the one connected by points , @xmath21 , contains an entangled photon pair ( biphoton ) source@xcite located in the baseline .",
    "for convenience , we take the biphoton source to be at the midpoint of the baseline at point @xmath22 at position @xmath23 .  additionally , each baseline contains a 50:50 beam splitter and two photon detectors , see figure [ boxe1 ] .  for simplicity of discussion",
    ", we assume that the biphoton source is essentially collocated with the beam splitter and two photon detectors at point @xmath22 , see figure 2 .  along  the baseline there is a controllable optical delay at point @xmath24 .",
    "the other two baselines contain the same equipment , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the qps works as follows .",
    "photon pairs are created at @xmath22 , are sent to positions @xmath25 * *  * * and * *  * * @xmath26 , and are re - directed to the user at the unknown position  @xmath27 .",
    "the two photon paths are similar , except that one path has a controllable optical delay @xmath24 .",
    "the optical delay is assumed to be calibrated so that we can accurately impose an arbitrary delay time@xcite .",
    "next , the entangled photons reflect from the user s corner cube reflector at @xmath27 , and return back through the same paths , through points @xmath28 * *  * * and * *  * * @xmath26 , and arrive at a hom interferometer that is collocated at @xmath22 at position @xmath29 , see figure [ boxe1 ] . for convenience , we assume that the interferometer is collocated with the photon generation point @xmath29 . again , both photon return paths are similar , but one path has the optical delay @xmath24 .",
    "we have the following effective round - trip times for each photon path@xmath30\\label{propagation times}\\\\ t_{r }   &   = \\frac{2}{c}[|\\mathbf{r}_{o}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|+|\\mathbf{r}% _ { 1}-\\mathbf{r}_{2}|+(n-1)\\ d]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the geometric thickness of the optical delay @xmath24 perpendicular to the optical path and @xmath32 is the effective index of refraction for the optical delay @xmath24 .  the optical delay @xmath24 is now adjusted until a minimum is observed in the two - photon counting rate at @xmath33@xcite .",
    "when the minimum in photon coincidence counting rate is observed at interferometer @xmath22 , the effective travel times for each photon path are equal , @xmath34 .",
    "the interferometer is balanced when the condition @xmath34 is satisfied , and a unique minimum is observed in the two - photon counting rate @xmath35 .",
    "the accuracy with which this minimum can be observed depends on the bandwidth @xmath36 of the band - pass interference filters used in front of the photon detectors .",
    "we get an equation that relates the geometric path lengths to the measured optical delay time @xmath37:@xmath38  an analogous measurement process is carried out for the other two baselines .  for simplicity",
    ",  i assume that the points @xmath22 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are located at midpoints of their baselines .",
    "we then obtain the three equations@xmath41@xmath42@xmath43 where @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the two - photon coincidence counting rate is given by@xcite@xmath46\\label{coincidence count rate}%\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the pump intensity in photons per second , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the quantum efficiencies of detectors @xmath24 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath52 is the fourier transform of the spectral function @xmath53 , which is the auotocorrelation function of the down - converted light @xmath54    the eqs.([baseline 1])-([baseline 3 ] ) can be solved for the three unknown user spatial coordinates , @xmath14 , in terms of the three measured time delays , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , which balanced the three interferometers .  the measured data consists of photon coincidence count rate vs. optical time delay lengths @xmath58 , for @xmath45 .  clearly a search must be done of the data to locate the minimum that corresponds to equal time of travel along the interferometer arms .",
    "the computations can be done at points @xmath22 , @xmath59 , and @xmath40 .",
    "this search to locate the minimum is the quantum analog of the correlation of the prn  code in a classical gps  receiver , which was described above .  when the three interferometers at @xmath22 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 have been balanced simultaneously , a classical message is sent to the user giving him the values of his coordinates @xmath60 .",
    "clearly , classical communication is needed between the points @xmath28 , @xmath26 , and @xmath61 to establish that the interferometers are balanced at a given coordinate time @xmath10 .",
    "we imagine that when each interferometer is balanced , a message is sent to the origin of coordinates .",
    "when three messages are simultaneously received at the origin of coordinates ( saying that the three interferometers are balanced ) , eqs.([baseline 1])-([baseline 3 ] ) are solved for the user s coordinates @xmath14 and the user s coordinates are sent to the user through a classical channel of communication .    in the qps that we describe",
    ", there is an apparent asymmetry in the determination of a user s spatial coordinates , @xmath60 , and in the determination of the user s time .  in my view , this asymmetry is a reflection of the asymmetric way that space and time enter in the theory of the quantized electromagnetic field to give rise to photons as quanta of the field .",
    "as mentioned above , the time synchronization of the user s clock to coordinate time is done by a method previously described by bahder and golding@xcite .",
    "therefore in what follows , i discuss only the spatial part of the qps .    with some modification of the above scheme",
    ", we may imagine that we could design a similar system based on first - order coherence for position determination@xcite .",
    "a single beam from a  continuous - wave laser can be split and the beams sent on two different paths .",
    "however , in such a case , there would be an ambiguity that is associated with the wavelength of the light ( interference fringes will be seen ) that is unresolvable in principle .",
    "in contrast , in the quantum case ( which relies on second - order coherence ) the ambiguity is resolved because equal propagation times for two paths lead to quantum interference : equal travel times for two paths create a _ unique",
    "_ observable minimum  in the two - photon coincidence counting rate @xmath35 .",
    "the measured quantities in the qps are the optical path delays @xmath58",
    ".  for a given measured value of optical delay , say @xmath62 , eq.([baseline 1 ] ) specifies that the user s coordinates must lie on a hyperboloid surface with foci at @xmath28 and @xmath26 , i.e. , a hyperbola of revolution that is symmetric about the baseline defined by @xmath28 and @xmath26 .",
    "the user s position , @xmath27 , is then given by the intersection of three hyperbolas given by eq.([baseline 1])-([baseline 3 ] ) .",
    "each eq.([baseline 1])-([baseline 3 ] ) is just the equation for a baseline in a classical time of arrival ( toa )  system that records arrival times of classical light pulses ( or distinct intensity edges ) at two spatial reception points @xmath7 .  in the case of a classical toa  system ,",
    "pulse  arrival time at _ four _ locations  is needed to determine all four space - time coordinates . in that case , four time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) equations can be formed from four points , and each point is used multiply to ( effectively ) form the baselines .",
    "( taking tdoas results in a system of three equations where the emission event time has cancelled out . )  in the quantum case , since correlations between photon pairs are used , we must use three baselines defined by six points @xmath7 , plus an additional interferometer for the determination of the user s time .  as we will see below",
    ", the qps  is an interferometric system .",
    "more fundamentally ,  and more significant for applications , is that in the classical case of a toa system , we must have good clocks that are synchronized to coordinate time so that accurate pulse arrival times at the four @xmath7 reception points can be recorded .",
    "a good clock that keeps coordinate time is often a difficult requirement to meet in practice@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the quantum case two - photon coincidence counts at detectors @xmath24and @xmath63 are measured and only a good `` flywheel '' clock is needed ( i.e. , a clock having a good short - term stability ) to measure photon coincidence count rates while the optical time delay is adjusted , to locate the minimum in @xmath35 .",
    "in the case of the classical gps , the geometrical positions of the gps satellites determine the accuracy of the user s position .  this effect",
    "is sometimes called the geometric dilution of precision ( gdop ) .",
    "we compute the positioning accuracy and the effect of gdop for the qps from eq.([baseline 1])-([baseline 3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath64these  equations give an implicit relation @xmath65 for the user position @xmath27 as a function of the three measured path delays , @xmath58 , and the six baseline endpoints @xmath7 .",
    "if we knew the error in the measured path length delays , @xmath66 , @xmath67and @xmath68 , we could compute the error in the three components of the user s position vector , @xmath69 , from @xmath70 for constant @xmath7 .",
    "however , these errors are statistical in nature , so instead i compute the standard deviations @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72 , and @xmath73 , of the user coordinates @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 ,  as a function of the standard deviations @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , of the measured optical time delays @xmath62 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .  for constant @xmath82 for @xmath83 ,",
    "these standard deviations are related by@xcite@xmath84 where the partial derivatives are done at  constant @xmath82 .  the lengthy calculation to compute the partial derivatives in eq.([xyz standard deviations ] ) is done analytically using _",
    "mathematica_.  for simplicity ,",
    "i assume that the error distributions of the @xmath58  are gaussian and that the three standard deviations are equal , @xmath85 . for a spherically symmetric probability distribution of 3-dimensional positions @xmath86 @xmath87 , the spherical error probable ( sep ) , which is the radius @xmath88 within which 50%  of the points lie , is related@xcite to the standard deviations @xmath89 by @xmath90 .  in our case , the probability distribution of @xmath27 is not necessarily spherical . to approximate the sep error metric ,",
    "we compute a weighted approximation to the sep metric by defining @xmath91 .",
    "when the error distribution for @xmath27 is spherically symmetrical , the error metrics are equal : @xmath92 .",
    "i consider the effect of gdop for two cases , one in which the interferometer baselines are near each other , and the other case where the baselines are well separated , which is the case with classical gps or a classical toa  system .",
    "first , consider  a case where the three baselines coincide with the three cartesian coordinate axes of a reference frame , see figure [ terrestrial interferometer ] .",
    "such a case might occur when the baselines are on the earth , and we want to determine the position of an object with respect to a topocentric coordinate system .",
    "for example , consider the center of the qps at the origin of cartesian coordinates and an object with a corner reflector at a range of 100@xmath93 from the qps ,  with coordinates @xmath94 .",
    "figure [ caseacontourplot ] shows a plot of contours of constant values of @xmath95 in the @xmath96 plane at @xmath97 , for the interferometer arm ( half ) length @xmath98 and error ( standard deviation ) in optical path @xmath99 .  in the contour plot , the position error is @xmath100 for @xmath94 , whereas for @xmath101 the error @xmath102 , which corresponds to the upper right high - accuracy ( light - shaded ) region in figure [ caseacontourplot ] .  on the @xmath103-axis at @xmath104 and",

    "the dependence of the error @xmath106 on the baseline length @xmath110 is plotted in figure [ caseaplot2 ] , also using @xmath111 .  for a four - meter baseline ,  @xmath112 ,",
    "the error is just under @xmath113 .",
    "note that the position error @xmath106 depends linearly on @xmath114 , which is the standard deviation ( error ) in measurement of the optical path delay needed to obtain the minimum in two - photon coincidence counts @xmath35 .",
    "the width of this minimum depends on the interference filters in front of the photon coincidence counting detectors as well as the pump laser bandwidth@xcite .",
    "depending on the experimental design , this minimum may be measured to better  than @xmath99 , which was used in these plots , and hence accuracies may be better than plotted .    finally , i note that the error function @xmath106 has a very complex dependence on user coordinates @xmath115 , and as stated earlier , the error function @xmath106 also depends critically on the way the baselines are distributed , i.e. , it depends on the six points @xmath82 for @xmath83 , which define the baseline endpoints . in the next example",
    ", i consider a situation where the baselines do not intersect , and thereby the error @xmath106 is considerably smaller than for the case considered above , even though the distances are larger .",
    "now assume that each point of a baseline , @xmath7 , is associated with a different satellite , and that the spatial interferometer legs are formed from pairs of points @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath13 , see figure [ qps plot ] .",
    "specifically , i assume that the points @xmath118 ,  are on low - earth orbit ( leo ) satellites .",
    "it may seem optimistic that a qps is feasible with such large baselines because single photons must be propagated over these baselines and then reliably detected .",
    "however , recently single photons have been propagated through the atmosphere and detected over 10 @xmath119 @xmath120distance in daylight@xcite , and another study concludes that there are no obstacles to create a single - photon quantum key distribution system between ground and low - earth orbiting satellites@xcite .",
    "therefore , a leo - satellite qps  may be possible .",
    "as an example of the positioning errors in a qps made from leo satellites , i take the baseline endpoints to be : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "a plot of this configuration is shown in figure [ qps plot ] .",
    "a contour plot of the reciprocal error function , @xmath95 , is shown in the @xmath96 plane for @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the earth s radius , see figure [ caseccontourplot ] .",
    "as an example , in the calculations below i take the semi - major axis of the leo satellites to be @xmath129 and the baseline between pairs of satellites as @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath120the standard deviation ( error ) in the measured optical delay is taken to be @xmath131 .  for a user on the surface of the earth with",
    "coordinates @xmath132 the error is @xmath133  for these same parameters , figure [ casecplot1 ] shows a plot of the position error @xmath106 @xmath120vs .",
    "@xmath74 for @xmath134",
    ".  note that over a large range of @xmath74-values the error remains below @xmath135 .",
    "finally , figure [ casecplot2 ] shows a plot of the position error in the radial direction : @xmath136 @xmath120vs .",
    "@xmath137  for the same parameters .  on a radial line in the ( 1,1,1 ) direction ,  the error remains below @xmath135  up to @xmath138  however , near @xmath139 the error rises steeply .",
    "this is an example of the complex dependence of @xmath106  on user position , which was mentioned earlier .",
    "clearly , the geometric positioning and layout of the baselines significantly affects the accuracy of a user s position .",
    "note that the terrestrial qps ( discussed in the previous section ) had a ratio of baseline length to user position @xmath140 , whereas this leo satellite qps has @xmath141 .",
    "by comparing the baseline layout for the terrestrial qps and this leo satellite qps , it is clear that the positioning accuracy is sensitive to the separation and layout of the baselines , but not so sensitive to the baseline lengths .",
    "other calculations ( not shown ) support this conclusion .   the above calculations for a satellite - based qps  are only meant as an example to illustrate the magnitude of errors in position that may be achievable .",
    "a significant amount of engineering calculations must be performed to design a realist satellite - based qps .",
    "furthermore , real satellites  are moving and engineering similar to that used in the classical gps  would have to be done , e.g. , using kalman filtering techniques .",
    "obviously , bright sources of entangled photons ( biphotons ) are needed .",
    "the calculations above suggest that if properly engineered , a satellite - based qps may achieve position accuracy of objects near the earth s surface below 1@xmath142 .  in these calculations ,",
    "i have ignored the time delays introduced by the atmosphere .",
    "however , corrections can be made for atmospheric effects using multiple colors of photons similarly to what is done with the gps .",
    "perhaps one advantage of the quantum system as compared to the classical gps is that entangled photons exhibit group velocity dispersion cancellation , which may be an important factor for future engineering and design of  a qps @xcite .",
    "a qps can be designed to work in several modes , depending on the needs of the user and the required scenario .  in the above discussion",
    ", we have described the case where a user of the qps wants to determine both his spatial and time coordinates , @xmath143 .",
    "a second alternative is that a user may only need to obtain their spatial coordinates , and he may not need the correct time . in this latter case , the time synchronization portion of the system is not needed , and the user may find their position coordinates @xmath144 by having only a corner reflector and a one - way ( reception only ) classical channel of communication with the reference frame origin , where the simultaneity of the three two - photon coincidence counting rate minima is established .",
    "another mode of operation of a qps is where we want to determine the position of an object with a corner cube reflector , such as a geostationary satellite .",
    "in such a case , information on the position of the satellite , @xmath145 , is only needed on the ground .",
    "the satellite s position coordinates can be determined on the ground using a qps , and only a corner cube reflector is needed on the satellite , but no communication channel to the satellite and no on - board clock is needed .",
    "the scenarios that we have described above are ones where the measurements ( adjusting the optical delays ) and the calculations ( to compute @xmath146 ) are done near the origin of the reference frame .  in a classical gps receiver ,",
    "the computations ( correlations of prn  codes to at least four satellites ) are done locally in the user s gps receiver that the user carries with him .",
    "the qps analog of this classical gps scenario is a setup where the biphotons are generated at points @xmath147 @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , but the user carries with him the 50:50 beam splitters and photon detectors . in this scenario ,",
    "the user controls ( and carries with him ) the optical delays , see figure [ baselinefigure ] , and he locally measures the optical delays @xmath148 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the user must receive a classical message consisting of the coordinates of baseline endpoints , @xmath7 , @xmath149 , and then he must solve the eq.([baseline 1])-([baseline 3 ] ) for his position @xmath14 .",
    "in such a case , there are no clocks on - board the broadcasting satellites ( located at positions @xmath7 ) , however , the user must carry a clock with short term stability to determine rate of photon coincidence counts from each of the three baselines ( associated with spatial positioning ) and also he must do coincidence counting for time determination ( if time is needed ) .  for the three spatial baselines ,",
    "optical propagation is then one - way ( using the satellite positions as a primary reference system , see below ) from satellites to qps  user receiver .  for time synchronization",
    ", however , as mentioned previously , the optical propagation must be two - way ( when using the method of bahder and golding ) .",
    "in essence , for each of the four channels , the qps receiver consists of a beam splitter , two single - photon detectors , and a controllable optical delay .",
    "all four space - time coordinates can be obtained by a user in this way .",
    "one clock in the reference frame must have long - term stability to define coordinate time , and another clock in the qps user receiver can have short - term stability .  _",
    "note that the satellites do not need to carry clocks , because their positions can be used to define the primary system of coordinates .",
    "_  this type of qps is a close analog of the classical gps .",
    "the satellites at baseline points @xmath7  can be taken to define the _ primary _ system of reference , even though the points @xmath7 change with time .",
    "the quantities measured by a user of such a qps are then @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the optical time delay ( in the hom  interferometer ) that will provide the user with coordinate time in this coordinate system ( using the bahder and golding method ) , and @xmath152 are the three optical delays in the three interferometers for position determination .",
    "the quantities @xmath150 are then to be regarded as generalized 4-dimensional space - time coordinates@xcite , @xmath151  is a time - like coordinate and @xmath153  are space - like coordinates .  within the context of general relativity , such coordinates are as good as any other coordinates , and they enter into the metric @xmath154  of the flat space - time assumed in this work .  of course ,",
    "a transformation from the qps space - time coordinates , @xmath150 , to an earth - centered inertial ( eci )  system of coordinates , say @xmath6 , is of interest for astrodynamic applications .",
    "such a transformation can be done approximately by conventional means of tracking the satellites ( at baseline points @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the qps allows the direct measurement of 4-dimensional space - time coordinates .",
    "previously , it was believed that space - time coordinates were not measurable quantities@xcite .",
    "of course , the qps  coordinates @xmath150 are real physical measurements , and it is well - known that real measurements are space - time invariants under generalized coordinate transformations@xcite .",
    "i have presented a conceptual scheme for an interferometric quantum positioning system ( qps )  based on second order quantum coherence of entangled photon pairs ( biphotons ) .",
    "a user s spatial coordinates are determined by locating three unique minima in three different two - photon counting rates , associated with three hom  interferometers built on independent baselines .",
    "the spatial portion of the qps  is similar to a classical toa system , however , a classical toa system requires synchronized clocks that keep coordinate time , which is often a difficult requirement to meet .  in contrast",
    ", the qps only requires a clock having a short - term stability to measure two - photon coincidence counting rates while the optical time delay is adjusted ( to locate the minima in the two - photon coincidence counting rate @xmath35 ) .",
    "bright sources of entangled photons ( biphotons ) are needed .",
    "several different scenarios were considered for a qps : one is a terrestrial system  and the another is space - based .  in both cases ,",
    "i computed the accuracy of a user s position as a function user position .",
    "the function that describes the errors in position has a complex spatial dependence .  in the case of the terrestrial qps ,",
    "the position accuracy was relatively poor because the baselines were located near each other . this could be dramatically improved by moving apart the baselines .",

    "<S> a quantum positioning system ( qps ) is proposed that can provide a user with all four of his space - time coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the user must carry a corner cube reflector , a good clock , and have a two - way classical channel of communication with the origin of the reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> four pairs of entangled photons ( biphotons ) are sent through four interferometers : three interferometers are used to determine the user s spatial position , and an additional interferometer is used to synchronize the user s clock to coordinate time in the reference frame . the spatial positioning part of the qps is similar to a classical time - of - arrival  ( toa ) system ,  however , a classical toa system ( such as gps ) must have synchronized clocks that keep coordinate time and therefore the clocks must have long - term stability , whereas in the qps only a photon coincidence counter is needed and the clocks need only have short - term stability . </S>",
    "<S> several scenarios are considered for a qps : one is a terrestrial system and another is a space - based - system composed of low - earth orbit ( leo )  satellites .  </S>",
    "<S> calculations indicate that for a space - based system , neglecting atmospheric effects , a position accuracy below the 1 cm - level is possible for much of the region near the earth .  </S>",
    "<S> the qps may be used as a primary system to define a global 4-dimensional reference frame . </S>"
