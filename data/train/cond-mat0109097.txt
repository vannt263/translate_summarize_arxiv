    "magnetic mutlilayers ( mml ) , heterostructures of alternating ferromagnetic layers and non - magnetic spacers , have attracted attention in the past 10 years because of their implications both for fundamental research and technical applications .",
    "the most remarkable properties of these materials are the antiparallel coupling of the ferromagnetic layers for particular thickness of the non - magnetic spacer and the giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) measured between this antiparallel configuration and the parallel one obtained by application of a magnetic field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this latter property is of direct interest for magnetic sensor technology and has been successfully implemented in a wide range of applications @xcite . however , while the gmr is widely accepted as being due to spin dependent scattering , the details of the mechanism are still the subject of intense investigations . in particular , a detailed description of the gmr in terms of the local electronic structure is still not available .",
    "fe / cr mml present an additional interest because of the electronic properties of the cr spacer .",
    "bulk cr is known to be an incommensurate spin density wave antiferromagnet ( @xmath10 ) , which is a consequence of the nesting of its fermi surface ( for a review on bulk cr see @xcite ) .",
    "the fermi surface of cr has been the subject of particular attention because of its similarity to that of high temperature superconductors @xcite . in thin films ,",
    "the magnetic properties of cr are strongly modified by the stress and the presence of ferromagnetic capping layers as observed by neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "in fe / cr ( 001 ) epitaxial mml , fullerton et al .",
    "@xcite showed the loss of magnetic long range order in cr layers for thicknesses @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic structure of these thin non - magnetic cr layers is not well documented in spite of its importance for the calculations of the gmr . beside the disappearance of the long range magnetic order that is attributed to the frustration of the cr magnetic moments at the interfaces @xcite",
    ", it is expected that the fermi surface of cr is affected by exchange interactions with magnetic fe .",
    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) made on a single cr layer epitaxially grown on atomically flat fe shows interesting features such as the presence of spin polarized electronic quantum well states @xcite .",
    "however , this measurement can not be directly compared with mml because the boundary conditions of the cr upper layer are not the same as those of a cr layer located deeper in the mml that is sandwiched between two fe layers ( for a discussion on the boundaries condition in the arpes measurement see himpsel et al .",
    "@xcite p 567 ) .",
    "in addition , gmr is also observed in polycrystalline samples with rougher interfaces , for which the arpes result may not be relevant .",
    "low temperature specific heat is a useful complementary technique to arpes , since it probes the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level @xmath12 , a quantity that controls transport phenomena and itinerant magnetism .",
    "moreover the specific heat is sensitive to both the surfaces and the bulk of the sample .",
    "recent progress in microcalorimetry @xcite opened access to investigation of thin films and microstructures with thickness of @xmath13 , which was prevented in the past by the small masses of these samples .",
    "we present in this paper low temperature specific heat measurements of an fe / cr mml .",
    "the debye temperature and electronic coefficient are extracted for the first time for @xmath13 films .",
    "this paper is divided in two parts : first , we show in some detail how electronic terms are extracted from the specific heat of metallic films of @xmath13 thickness .",
    "second , we present specific heat data of a sputtered fe / cr mml and compare it to that of fe and cr films .",
    "our results show that the electronic contribution of the fe / cr mml is different from that expected in a simple model where bulk values of fe and cr are used .",
    "possible origins for this result are discussed .",
    "\\(110 ) textured fe / cr superlattices were directly sputtered at room temperature on the membrane of a microcalorimeter .",
    "the microcalorimeters consist of a @xmath14 si ( 100 ) frame surrounding a @xmath15 window covered with a low stress @xmath16 @xmath17 thick membrane @xcite .",
    "the film is sputtered through a @xmath18 shadow mask so that the deposited sample , located at the center of the membrane , is thermally insulated from the si frame . for characterization purposes ,",
    "a si ( 100 ) substrate covered with @xmath16 has been placed next to the microcalorimeter during the deposition to serve as a test sample .",
    "33 fe / cr bilayers have been deposited at an averaged rate of @xmath19 with a base pressure of @xmath20 that was increased to @xmath21 of ar during the deposition .",
    "we briefly give a description of the characterization of the mml .",
    "a detailed description of fe / cr mml deposited in our laboratory is reported elsewhere @xcite and we refer the reader to this study for more details on the microstructure .    the thickness of the cr layer was adjusted to obtain antiparallel coupling of the fe layers .",
    "the thickness of the film and bilayers , obtained by fitting xrd data made on the test sample , are @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the thickness of the fe layers is @xmath24 as measured from the total thickness of an fe film deposited under the same conditions as the mml without cr , implying a cr layer thickness of @xmath25 .",
    "magnetization and magnetotransport measurements were performed on the test sample .",
    "magnetization made at @xmath26 with the magnetic field parallel to the layers showed a saturation magnetization 0 to the volume of the fe layers of @xmath27 to be compared to @xmath28 for bulk fe .",
    "a small hysteresis is present , 0 by a remanent field of @xmath29 and a remanent magnetization @xmath30 .",
    "magnetotransport measured at @xmath26 with the van der pauw method with current in the plane gave a residual resistivity @xmath31 and a magnetoresistance @xmath32 , with a saturation field of @xmath33 .",
    "these data confirm a predominant antiparallel coupling between the fe layers expected for @xmath34 , in agreement with other studies on fe / cr mml ( see for example @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the non - vanishing remanent magnetization is attributed to pinholes that induce ferromagnetic shorts or local change of coupling due to cr thickness fluctuations .",
    "interdiffusion at the interfaces reduces the saturation magnetization of the sample with respect to the value expected for bulk fe .",
    "these results are in agreement with those reported for mml with the same number of bilayers and deposited with the same ar pressure @xcite .",
    "two additional microcalorimeters , one with an fe and the other with a cr film , were prepared under the same deposition conditions .",
    "all microcalorimeters used in this work were chosen from the same wafer , which keeps variations in the microcalorimeter properties to less than 5 % @xcite .",
    "the thicknesses of the fe ( @xmath35 ) and cr films ( @xmath36 ) are close to that of the mml to allow direct comparison of the raw data .",
    "the relaxation method @xcite was used to measure the specific heat .",
    "application of this technique to the @xmath37 microcalorimeters is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this technique is especially suitable when absolute values of the specific heat are desirable over a large temperature range .",
    "when the internal thermal time constant @xmath38 is much faster than the external time constant @xmath39 , the dynamics of the 2d heat transfer reduces to a 1d single time constant relaxation . the following simple equation , then , relates the measured @xmath40 and thermal conductance linking sample and si frame @xmath41 to the total specific heat @xmath42 :    @xmath43    contributions to @xmath44 include the heat capacities of the sample @xmath45 and the addenda @xmath46 that consists of the thermometers and heater , the membrane beneath the sample and part of the thermal link",
    ". if a thermal conduction layer is necessary , as will be discussed in more detail below , its heat capacity adds to @xmath46 .",
    "for our microcalorimeters , the thermal link at low temperature consists of the membrane located between the sample and the frame and 8 pt leads ( @xmath47 ) . using numerical simulation of the 2d heat flow of our microcalorimeter ,",
    "we obtain the result that 22.3% of the thermal link has to be included in @xmath46 @xcite . this is less than the 33% calculated by bachmann et al .",
    "@xcite in the 1d case .",
    "the same simulations showed that this contribution does not depend on @xmath45 when parameters ( density , thickness and specific heat ) of the samples measured in this study are used .",
    "in that case , this contribution is cancelled out in the difference @xmath48 , which justify this subtraction technique to extract the specific heat of the sample .",
    "a necessary and testable condition for the validity of eq . [ one ] is a large difference between the thermal conductances of the sample and the membrane ( @xmath49 ) . in that case , the temperature is constant across the sample and drops between the edge of the sample area and the frame so that the measured @xmath41 is dependent solely on the thermal link . under standard procedures ,",
    "a thermal conduction layer is deposited either over or under the sample to ensure this . to avoid an unnecessary increase of @xmath46 that results from the thermal conduction layer",
    ", we first checked if the thermal conductivity of the fe , cr or fe / cr samples is sufficient to ensure a good thermal homogeneity across the sample area .",
    "estimates of the temperature gradient across the sample can be made since two @xmath50 thermometers with different geometries are located on the back of the film .",
    "steady state measurements performed on the cr film at @xmath51 with a power of @xmath52 applied to the pt sample heater showed an increase of @xmath53 in the first thermometer and @xmath54 in the second ( see figure 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite for details concerning the design of the microcalorimeters ) .",
    "this temperature difference is due to the low thermal conductivity of the cr film . as a consequence , single time constant measurements ( eq . [ one ] )",
    "can not be made on the microcalorimeter loaded with cr only .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the fe and fe / cr mml as similar or lower thermal conductivities are expected for these samples .    to improve the thermal conductivity of the samples , a cu layer was deposited on top of the samples :",
    "the three microcalorimeters together with a bare microcalorimeter taken from the same wafer were put next to each other in a resistive evaporation chamber in which cu was evaporated .",
    "the thickness of the cu layer ( @xmath55 ) was measured using a dektak profilometer on test samples that had been placed close to the microcalorimeters during the deposition .",
    "the dispersion of the thickness was found to be about @xmath56 which is the ( absolute ) precision of the profilometer .",
    "the same measurement of temperature homogeneity was performed on the cr sample but now with the cu thermal conduction layer in the temperature range @xmath57 where both thermometers can be measured : no difference of temperature was measured between the two thermometers within the 0.3% error bars of the temperature measurement .",
    "the time constant @xmath58 is obtained by recording the off - balance signal of an ac resistive bridge - of which one arm is the nbsi thermometer - when the current applied to the pt heater is switched off .",
    "the amplitude of the temperature change is set to 1 % of the baseline temperature @xmath59 .",
    "20 decays are averaged and fitted using a single exponential function with a typical error of 0.8% .",
    "figure [ figtau ] shows the measured @xmath58 for the addenda , cr , fe and fe / cr samples in the temperature range @xmath60 .    the integrated thermal conductance @xmath61 is obtained by applying a known power @xmath62 in the heater and measuring the steady state increase of temperature of the sample @xmath63 which gives : @xmath64    different @xmath63 ranging from 2 to 5% of @xmath59 are measured .",
    "@xmath61 is then fitted with a fourth order polynomial in @xmath59 and @xmath63 from the coefficients of which the thermal conductance @xmath65 is calculated . the typical error of the least square fit is @xmath66 . for the sake of a comparison of the raw data , we present in figure [ figkappa ] the measured conductance @xmath67 , which is a good approximation for small @xmath63 .",
    "the values of @xmath61 for the four microcalorimeters are scattered by less than 3 % .",
    "this shows that basic parameters of the membrane such as the thickness , size and composition are very close in the four microcalorimeters .",
    "this is a very important conclusion that allows us to calculate the specific heat of the sample films from the difference @xmath48 , where @xmath46 is the addenda heat capacity of the microcalorimeter with the conduction layer only .",
    "the total heat capacities @xmath44 were calculated using the experimental values of @xmath58 and the fitted conductance @xmath41 and equation [ one ] .",
    "@xmath44 was measured from @xmath68 to @xmath69 for the fe and cr samples and up to room temperature for the fe / cr mml and the addenda sample .",
    "@xmath44 values are presented in figure [ figheatcapa ] in the temperature range @xmath70 using the usual @xmath71 representation .",
    "we report on the same plot an estimate of the contribution of the cu layer calculated from the bulk coefficients ( electronic coefficient @xmath72 and debye temperature @xmath73 @xcite ) .",
    "this contribution represents 40 - 50% of the heat capacity of the addenda .",
    "the remaining part , which varies roughly as @xmath74 , is dominated by the @xmath16 membrane .",
    "estimate of @xmath75 using the density @xmath76 is in good agreement with values measured by zeller and pohl for various glasses @xcite .",
    "assuming a @xmath77 composition leads to @xmath78 .",
    "these values should nt be considered as the result of an actual fit of @xmath46 .",
    "there is actually no way to separate the cu and @xmath77 contributions using this set of data only .",
    "the contributions of the cr , fe films and fe / cr multilayer to the total heat capacities are proportionally larger at low temperature ( 37% , 48% and 51% respectively at @xmath68 ) , because the specific heat of the @xmath79 membrane decreases with @xmath80 in this temperature range .",
    "the total heat capacity is therefore dominated at the lowest temperatures by the linear terms of the specific heat of the metallic cr , fe and fe / cr films .",
    "since the thickness of the films and the molar densities of fe and cr are similar , important qualitative conclusions can already be drawn prior to any subtraction or normalization .",
    "the four curves plotted in figure [ figheatcapa ] appear as straight lines , which means that they can be described by the characteristic expression @xmath81 observed in metals .",
    "no upturns are present down to @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , the curve of the mml lies above the curve of fe and cr .",
    "this indicates that the electronic term @xmath82 of the mml is not the simple mean of fe and cr weighted by their respective contribution to the mass of the mml as would be expected in a simple model . finally , the slopes of the three upper curves are similar , which implies lattice terms of similar magnitude in the three samples",
    ".    we now turn to a more quantitative analysis of the data .",
    "figure [ figsh ] shows the specific heat @xmath83 of the three samples in the temperature range @xmath84 .",
    "these three curves are the result of the normalized difference of the heat capacities of the sample microcalorimeters and the fitted heat capacity of the addenda .",
    "we assume that the heat capacity of the sample microcalorimeters @xmath44 differ from @xmath46 only by the heat capacity of the fe , cr and fe / cr samples .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that all calorimeters were taken from the same wafer and had very similar values of @xmath85 ( see figure [ figkappa ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the small variation of the thermal properties reported in the original paper on these microcalorimeters @xcite .",
    "the fe and cr specific heat were normalized using the bulk values of the density ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively ) and molar mass ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively ) .",
    "we used for the mml the sum of the total number of moles of fe and cr in the mml ( @xmath90 ) . note",
    "that as the bulk fe and cr molar densities are the same within 2% ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively ) , this normalization does not depend critically on the respective values of the thickness of the layers in the mml .",
    "the error in the normalized specific heat @xmath83 has essentially two independent origins : first the experimental errors in @xmath44 , which are 2% in total ( see discussion above ) and lead to a temperature dependent error in the difference ( 6% at @xmath68 and 12% at @xmath93 for the fe / cr mml ) and second , the error introduced in the normalization by the uncertainty on the thickness and density of the films that is estimated conservatively to be 5% .",
    "we fitted the three curves with the usual expression of the specific heat of metals at low temperatures :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the electronic coefficient that is proportional to the effective mass of the electrons for a degenerate fermi liquid . more precisely ,    @xmath96    where @xmath12 is the electronic dos of the bare electrons and @xmath97 is the mass enhancement factor caused , for example , by electron - phonon interactions .",
    "@xmath95 is temperature independent for @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is the fermi energy and @xmath101 is the cut - off energy of the excitations responsible for the mass enhancement ) . for a wide variety of compounds ,",
    "the phonon contribution to the specific heat can be successfully described by a 3d linear debye - like dispersion . at low temperature ( @xmath102 )",
    ", this approximation leads to the second term in equation [ three ] with a coefficient @xmath103 that is :    @xmath104 \\over \\theta_d^{3}. } \\label{five}\\ ] ]    where @xmath105 is the cut - off energy of the phonons and @xmath106 is the molar gas constant .",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath107 values obtained by fitting equation [ three ] to the @xmath83 data are summarized in table [ table1 ] and compared with bulk values @xcite,@xcite . to avoid spurious values of @xmath107 resulting from a fit made beyond the low temperature asymptote",
    ", we restrict the fit to the range @xmath108 , which is about 4% of @xmath107 .    the presence of a magnetic term @xmath109 due to spin - wave excitations is expected in the specific heat of the fe and fe / cr samples .",
    "taking the bulk value @xmath110 measured in bulk fe @xcite , results in a spin - wave contribution that is less than 1% of the total specific heat in the range @xmath70 and is therefore beyond our resolution .",
    "spin - wave excitations in the fe / cr sample are more interesting because they are controlled by the coupling between the fe layers",
    ". theoretical calculation of the contribution of the spin - wave excitation to the specific heat of co / cu mml has been made by mlin and fominaya @xcite .",
    "this contribution is few percent of the total specific heat at low temperature and vanishes for a magnetic field larger than the saturation field .",
    "to investigate the presence of this contribution in our data , we measured the fe / cr mml in magnetic fields up to @xmath111 .",
    "the 0 of the microcalorimeters in magnetic fields is the subject of a separate paper @xcite . the magnetic field *",
    "b * was applied in the direction of the layers .",
    "we first checked that @xmath85 was independent of the magnetic field .",
    "we then recorded the variation of @xmath112 for fixed temperature @xmath113 and @xmath26 .",
    "no variation of @xmath112 was observed within the 1% resolution of this measurement .",
    "the absence of this term is explained by the presence of a gap in the spin wave excitations that is present in zero magnetic field already and that reduces the thermally accessible excitations .",
    "we note that high resolution electrical resistivity measurements on similar samples showed no indication of a spin - wave contribution in the temperature range @xmath114 , which is in agreement with our result @xcite .",
    "finally , a measurement of the specific heat of the mml and the addenda was performed up to room temperature .",
    "the same procedure as that used for the low temperature was applied to extract the specific heat @xmath83 of the mml .",
    "data are reported in figure [ figshht ] . to allow comparison with calculation made at constant volume(@xmath115 ) , @xmath83 measured at constant pressure ( @xmath116 ) has to be corrected by a factor @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the grneisen coefficient and @xmath119 the volume thermal expansion coefficient ( not to be confused with the coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath103 used in equation [ three ] ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge no such data are available for fe / cr mml .",
    "we therefore estimate the correction using the bulk fe ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) and cr ( @xmath122 , @xmath123 ) values @xcite and assuming isotropic 0 , which gives a correction of about 1% at @xmath124 . as",
    "this value is much less than our experimental errors , we neglect this correction in the next discussion .",
    "we compare in figure [ figshht ] the specific heat of the mml to a simple model where we assume that @xmath83 is the sum of an electronic term with temperature independent @xmath95 and a phonon term calculated from the debye approximation , which gives :    @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the debye function @xcite .",
    "no single set of parameters @xmath95 and @xmath107 could fit the entire range .",
    "a good fit is obtained up to @xmath69 using equation [ six ] with the low temperature parameters @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "above this temperature , the data deviate significantly from the low temperature curve . in the range @xmath129 , a reasonable agreement",
    "is found using the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "note that the uncertainty on these latter parameters is much larger than at low temperature because of the correlation between @xmath95 and @xmath107 in equation [ six ] and the smaller contribution of the sample to the total heat capacity .",
    "however , it is clear that the deviation to the low temperature fit is outside the error bars .",
    "this deviation can be understood in this simple model as the result of an increase of @xmath107 and a decrease of @xmath95 .",
    "we mention that this conclusion would still hold in the case where the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath119 is very different from the bulk value @xmath132 : on one hand , if @xmath133 then the correction on @xmath116 becomes negligible and the same coefficients would be obtained . in the opposite limit @xmath134 ,",
    "the correction would result in @xmath115 data that are smaller than those reported in figure [ figshht ] .",
    "as a consequence , @xmath107 would be larger .",
    "therefore , @xmath131 can be considered as a lower limit of the high temperature @xmath107 in the approximation where the bulk thermal expansion is used .",
    "we first comment on the low temperature @xmath107 values . in all three samples a clear reduction of @xmath107 with respect to bulk values indicates a softening of the low energy ( @xmath135 ) phonon modes .",
    "we note that @xmath107 of the fe and cr films are similar ( @xmath136 ) in spite of different bulk values ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath107 of the fe / cr mml is further reduced with respect to these values ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "very few experimental data are available on @xmath107 values for thin films .",
    "specific heat measurements of @xmath140 thick @xmath141 films showed that for @xmath142 and @xmath143 @xmath107 is close to the bulk values @xcite .",
    "the same group reported @xmath107 values for nb / zr ml @xcite . in the limit of very thick layers",
    ", they observe that @xmath107 is smaller than the value expected in a non interacting model , which is explained by these authors by the presence of nbzr alloy at the interfaces .",
    "recent development of inelastic nuclear @xmath95-ray scattering ( inrs ) has provided access to phonon dos measurements on films as thin as @xmath144 .",
    "measurements on sputtered fe films with different thickness @xcite and nanocrystalline films @xcite showed that an enhancement of the low energy phonon dos correlates with increasing disorder .",
    "this enhancement of the low energy dos would result in a lower @xmath107 as observed in our measurements .",
    "the physical origin of this phenomena is not understood in detail .",
    "a phenomenological model introducing a finite lifetime of the phonons is used by these authors to fit the dos with relative success . a similar correlation between disorder and decrease of @xmath107",
    "can be deduced from our data if one considers the textured nature of the films and the additional disorder introduced in the mml by the interdiffusion and roughness of the interfaces .",
    "we note that our result is consistent with the softening of the phonon modes measured in metallic superlattices by schuller et al .",
    "it is important to add that the low energy part ( @xmath145 ) of the dos obtained by inrs follows roughly the square dependence in energy of the 3d debye model for a surprisingly wide variety of samples .",
    "this dependence is in agreement with the @xmath80 term observed in our data .",
    "we now turn to the electronic contributions @xmath95 .",
    "the value for fe is reasonably close to the bulk value .",
    "a large enhancement of @xmath146 is observed with respect to the bulk value of cr ( @xmath147 @xcite ) .",
    "pure bulk cr is 0 by an incommensurate spin density wave ( isdw ) magnetic order , which suppresses @xmath95 below the value for non - magnetic cr ( @xmath148 ) that is calculated from the extrapolation of @xmath95 for various cr alloys ( @xcite or see fig .",
    "37 of ref .",
    "this reduction of @xmath95 in the ordered phase is explained by the gap opened on the fermi surface by condensation of electron - hole pairs . as a consequence of this gap",
    ", the low temperature electronic entropy is reduced .",
    "the higher value of @xmath95 for cr observed in our data indicates that the bulk isdw magnetism is not present in our cr film .",
    "bulk isdw is known to be modified in epitaxial cr films depending on the thickness and capping layer as seen in neutron scattering data by bdeker et al . @xcite .",
    "combining this effect with the high sensitivity of the isdw to disorder @xcite gives a plausible explanation for the increase of @xmath146 .",
    "note that the same effect is not expected in fe films of the same quality because the ferromagnetism of fe is more robust due to the more localized nature of the electrons responsible for the magnetism in this case .",
    "we emphasize that the measurement of the electronic term @xmath95 is a very direct probe of the magnetism of cr since itinerant antiferromagnetism is related to the appearance of a gap on the fermi surface .",
    "the difference in @xmath95 between the ordered and non - magnetic phase leads to a significant variation of the low temperature specific heat ( more than 50% at @xmath68 ) . magnetic or transport measurements give less stringent criteria for the presence or absence of an ordered magnetic state in cr : as the susceptibility of cr is largely dominated by core electrons , the contribution of the itinerant electrons is only 3 percent of the total susceptibility ( see figure 35 of reference @xcite ) .",
    "in transport measurements , the variation of the resistivity in the itinerant antiferromagnetism is due to the decrease of the electron spin scattering , which is an indirect effect .    the large value obtained for the fe / cr mml @xmath149 is striking and more puzzling .",
    "assuming that each layer in the mml can be described by the bulk values of fe and magnetic cr and assuming perfect interfaces leads to @xmath150 . using the more realistic non - magnetic value for cr",
    "@xcite increases @xmath8 only slightly to @xmath151 , half of the measured value .",
    "the absence of electronic band structure calculation complicates the interpretation of this result : purely electronic effects , effective mass enhancement , presence of other phases with high electronic @xmath95 and other type of excitations are hard to separate .    in the absence of excitations",
    "other than electronic , equation [ four ] shows that an increase of @xmath95 can result from an increase of either @xmath152 or @xmath12 .",
    "note that these two quantities are not independent as @xmath152 is proportional to @xmath12 . as a consequence ,",
    "an increase in @xmath12 results in an increase of @xmath152 whereas the opposite is not true .",
    "since no magnetic field dependence was observed , @xmath152 is attributed to the electron - phonon interaction only .",
    "softening of the phonons as observed in the reduced @xmath107 of the fe / cr mml is known to increase @xmath152 .",
    "this is observed for example in the comparison of the superconducting properties of @xmath153 and @xmath154 @xcite . in a simple debye approximation that is valid only at low temperature ( @xmath155 ) , @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this effect can not account for the totality of the increase of @xmath95 : even a 40% decrease of @xmath107 - which would increase @xmath152 by a factor two with respect to the bulk values of fe and cr i.e. 0.2 @xcite - only increases @xmath95 by 20% .",
    "another possible cause for the increase in @xmath157 is the presence of an @xmath158 alloy phase at the interfaces .",
    "due to the very close atomic and electronic properties of fe and cr atoms and the continuous solubility of the alloy , interdiffusion at the interfaces of fe / cr mml is possible .",
    "quantitative analysis of the interface roughness of fe / cr mml deposited under similar conditions has been made by gomez et al .",

    ", we estimate the interdiffusion length as the standard deviation of the profile for the smallest window width , which is about @xmath159 .",
    "values of @xmath95 have been measured for bulk @xmath158 alloy by cheng et al .",
    "interestingly , the variation of @xmath160 for bulk samples is not monotonic and show a significant enhancement with respect to pure fe and cr values for @xmath161 .",
    "this effect could not be reproduced in electronic band structure calculations by kulikov and demangeat @xcite and steward and ruvalds @xcite probably because many body effects at the origin of the sdw in cr and the competing ferromagnetic order of the fe spins are not taken into account in these calculations @xcite . to estimate the effect of the presence of an fe - cr alloy on @xmath157",
    ", we take an average value of @xmath162 calculated from the data of cheng et al .",
    "distributed over @xmath163 at the interfaces . for the rest of the mml",
    ", we use the bulk values of fe and non - magnetic cr .",
    "this simple model gives @xmath164 . combining this effect and the enhancement of @xmath152 results in @xmath165 still considerably below the measured @xmath166 .",
    "note that the calculation of the contribution of the @xmath158 alloy has been done using bulk values , which is questionable to describe few angstrm thick layers in proximity to a ferromagnetic fe layer . in this",
    "context , local measurements of the electronic dos in the perpendicular direction of the plane would be of great interest .",
    "we emphasize that an enhanced dos at the interfaces of the mml whatever its origin , will play a role in the gmr : the combination of a large , partially polarized dos @xmath12 and scattering centers , both located at the interfaces , is one of the proposed mechanisms for gmr in mml . in calculations by zahn et al .",
    "@xcite on cocu mml , the enhancement of @xmath12 at the interfaces is the consequence of the periodic potential of the layered structure that affects the electron states .",
    "this enhancement is essentially due to minority electrons of co that are confined in the co layer due to the mismatch of their band structure and that of cu .",
    "these authors show that adding scattering centers at the interfaces causes the minority electrons to be more scattered than the majority electrons . as a consequence ,",
    "the layer resolved gmr is large at the interfaces . considering that @xmath167 alloy is polarized for @xmath168 ,",
    "is intrinsically disordered and has a large electronic dos suggests that interdiffused interfaces play a similar role in fe / cr mml .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the linear increase of the absolute gmr with the interface roughness observed recently by santamaria et al .",
    "we report in this paper specific heat measurements of two films of fe and cr and an fe / cr multilayer .",
    "a precise description of the method and techniques used to measure the specific heat of these @xmath13 thick films was given .",
    "in the temperature range @xmath169 , the specific heat of the three samples can be described with the usual expression expected for metals .",
    "a softening of the phonons is observed in all samples , which we suggest is a consequence of the disorder , in agreement with inrs data taken on similar samples .",
    "the electronic terms of the fe and cr are compatible with bulk values whereas the multilayer value is much larger than expected in any simple model . no dependence on magnetic field",
    "is seen ( to better than 1% ) which rules out changes in electronic density of states as a unique source for gmr .",
    "a magnetic origin for the enhancement of @xmath95 is excluded because of the absence of magnetic field dependence .",
    "probable causes include an enhanced electron phonon interaction due to the softening of the phonons and the presence of an @xmath170 alloy at the interfaces with enhanced electronic density of states .",
    "we propose that the enhanced @xmath95 of the multilayer plays a role in the magnetotransport , consistent with a model presented recently that emphasized the importance of interface states for gmr effects .",
