    "the bacterial min - proteins are a well studied example of a pattern - forming protein system that gives rise to rich spatiotemporal oscillations .",

    "most bacteria use a cytoskeletal structure , a so - called _ z - ring _ , for the completion of bacterial cytokinesis @xcite .",
    "this z - ring self - assembles from filaments of polymerized ftsz - proteins , the prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic protein tubulin @xcite , which serve as a scaffold structure for midcell constriction and the eventual septum formation in the midplane .",

    "a necessary prerequisite for successful symmetric cell division is hence the targeted assembly of ftsz towards midcell . in _",
    "cells this is mediated by two independent mechanisms , nucleoid occlusion and the dynamic oscillation of the mincde proteins @xcite . while nucleoid occlusion prevents division near the chromosome , the min - system actively keeps the divisome away from the cell poles through the minc - protein acting as ftsz - polymerization inhibitor @xcite .",
    "the characteristic pole - to - pole oscillations create a time - averaged concentration gradient with a minimal inhibitor concentration of minc at midcell , suppressing z - ring assembly at the cell poles @xcite .",
    "although minc is indispensable for correct division site placement , it acts only as a passenger molecule , passively following the oscillatory dynamics of mind and mine @xcite .    on the molecular level ,",
    "the oscillations emerge from the cycling of the atpase mind between a freely diffusing state in the cytosolic bulk and a membrane - bound state , induced by its activator mine under continuous consumption of chemical energy by atp - hydrolysis , as shown schematically in figure [ cycle ] . in its atp - bound form mind",

    "despite the fact that the physicochemical details of mind membrane binding are not yet fully understood , it has been demonstrated that mind membrane binding is a cooperative process @xcite . when being bound , mind diffuses along the membrane .",
    "it also recruits mine which in turn triggers the atpase activity of mind , breaking the complex apart and releasing all constituents back into the cytosol .",
    "mind then freely diffuses in the bulk and can , after renewed loading of atp and dimerization , rebind to the membrane at a new position .",

    ", traveling surface waves were observed in the form of turning spirals and traveling stripes on flat homogeneous substrates , where mind proteins form a moving wave - front , that is consumed by mine at the trailing edge , demonstrating that mind and mine alone are indeed sufficient to induce dynamic patterning @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these assays work for different lipid species , demonstrating the robustness of the min - oscillations with respect to the detailed values of the binding rates .    combining this reconstitution approach with membrane patterning",
    ", it was shown that the min - system is capable of orienting its oscillation axis along the longest path in the patch and hence in principle capable of sensing the surrounding geometry @xcite .",

    ", one can place growing cells in microfabricated chambers of custom shape @xcite .",
    "this _ cell sculpting _",
    "approach allowed the authors to systematically analyze the adaptation of the min - oscillations to compartment geometry and demonstrated experimentally that different oscillation patterns can be stable for the same cell geometry . using image processing , it was possible to measure the relative frequency of the different modes for a large range of interesting geometries @xcite .",
    "figure [ cycle ] summarizes the different geometries that have been used before in experiments and that are considered here with computer simulations .",

    "the theory of reaction - diffusion processes offers a suitable framework to address the min - oscillations from a theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed to unravel the physical principles behind this intriguing self - organizing protein system and to explain the origin of its rich spatiotemporal dynamics . while all of them rely on a reaction - diffusion mechanism similar to the turing model , they differ severely in their details .",
    "the first class of mathematical models used an effective one - dimensional pde - approach and relied strongly on phenomenological non - linearities in the reaction terms @xcite .",
    "although all of them successfully gave rise to pole - to - pole oscillations , they did not allow a clear interpretation of the underlying biomolecular processes and were not in agreement with all experimental observations , such as mine - ring formation and the dependence of the oscillation frequency on biological parameters .",
    "the next advance in model building was the focus on the decisive role of mind aggregation and the relevance of mind being present in two states ( adp- and atp - bound ) @xcite .",
    "very importantly , this highlighted the interplay between unhindered diffusion with a nucleotide exchange reaction in the bulk as a delay element for mind reattachment @xcite .",
    "subsequent models shared a common core framework but still differed strongly in the functional form of the protein binding kinetics and the transport properties of membrane - bound molecules @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the more recent models was the dimensionality , ranging from one dimension @xcite to two @xcite and three @xcite .",
    "moreover , the models can be classified as deterministic pde - models or using stochastic simulation frameworks , and whether they neglected membrane diffusion @xcite or not . while some models contained higher than second order non - linearities in concentrations of the reaction terms @xcite , it is the prevailing opinion to rely on at most second order non - linearities , allowing for a clear interpretation in terms of bimolecular reactions .",
    "following the same line of thought , a strong effort was made to distill a minimal system that explains the oscillation mechanism without the necessity of spatial templates or prelocalized determinants @xcite and neglecting secondary processes like filament formation @xcite .",
    "the most influential minimal model for the min - system has been suggested by huang and coworkers @xcite .",
    "it has been further simplified by discarding cooperative mind recruitment by minde complexes on the membrane @xcite , allowing a clear view on the core mechanisms : the cycling of mind between bulk and membrane , cooperativity of mind - recruitment and diffusion in bulk and along the membrane . using the minimal model",
    ", it has been shown that the canalized transfer of proteins from one polar zone to the other underlies the robustness of the min - oscillations @xcite .",
    "because the deterministic variants of the minimal model @xcite do not allow us to address the role of stochastic fluctuations , a stochastic and fully three - dimensional version has been introduced to study the effect of stochastic fluctuations in patterned environments @xcite . for rectangular patterns of @xmath0 , it was found that the system can be bistable , with transverse pole - to - pole oscillations along the minor and longitudinal striped oscillations along the major axis , respectively . in this early work",
    ", it was observed that the stable phase emerged depending on the initial conditions and that sometimes switching occurred , but the statistics was not sufficiently good to observe switching in quantitative detail .",
    "indeed such multistability has been observed experimentally in sculptured cells over a large range of cell shapes @xcite and the deterministic minimal model has been used to explain the relative frequency of the different oscillations patterns for a given shape using a perturbation scheme @xcite .",
    "however , as a deterministic model , this approach was not able to address the rate with which one pattern stochastically switches into another .    here",
    "we address this important subject by using particle - based brownian dynamics computer simulations .",
    "compared to earlier work along these lines @xcite , we have developed new methods to efficiently simulate and analyze the switching process .",
    "we find excellent agreement with experimental data and measure for the first time the switching time of multistable oscillation patterns .",
    "we also use our model to confirm that it contains the minimal ingredients for the emergence of min - oscillations .",
    "in addition , we use our stochastic model to investigate the three - dimensional concentration profiles in different geometries and in particular the role of edges in membrane - covered compartments .",
    "we identify novel oscillation patterns in compartments with membrane - covered walls and find a surprisingly simple ( linear ) relation between the bound min - protein densities and the volume - to - surface ratio , which might be relevant for geometry sensing by _ e. coli _ cells .",
    "for the particle - based simulation , we use the reaction scheme of the minimal model for cooperative attachment @xcite .",

    "the shapes of the bound mind protein density clusters in the kymographs have a triangular form , in contrast to the line - like structures of the bound mine proteins . those density lines in the bound mine kymograph show that the mine proteins form a high density cluster in the middle of the cell which propagates to one of the compartment poles .",
    "this behavior is similar to the experimentally observed ringlike structures of mine proteins in _ e. coli _ bacteria that travel from the middle to the poles of the cell , leading to the dissociation of mind proteins from the membrane .",

    "_ @xcite .    to analyze the influence of the bulk volume on the oscillations , we have also monitored how the mind and mine densities changes at different heights above the membrane . for this",

    "was divided in three layers , and for each layer the mean density on one side of the major axis was plotted over time as shown in figure [ cut ] .",
    "we see that the largest density changes take place in the layer directly above the membrane , however , the oscillations persist up to the top layer even for the highest compartment with @xmath68 . strikingly , the mind - density is always much higher than the one of mine .",
    "furthermore we reduced the compartment height to .",
    "interestingly , the pole - to - pole oscillations were still present .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the simulation volume has only a mild effect on the oscillations in geometry a , despite the fact that there are appreciable density variations in the bulk .",
    "we next checked that our model indeed includes the essential elements for the emergence of min - oscillations .",
    "because the mind - switching between bulk and membrane is clearly indispensible , here we consider the relevance of diffusion on the membrane and of cooperative recruitment .",
    "all simulations in this section are carried out using geometry a in a @xmath69 compartment geometry .",
    "we chose this geometry since we expect it to give rise to stable longitudinal pole - to - pole oscillations and hence can closely monitor any deviations from this default oscillation mode .",
    "all other parameters were kept fixed and we used parameter set a for this test .",
    "figure [ sensitivity ] shows three kymographs of the system along the major axis .",
    "switching off membrane diffusion entirely ( first panel ) leads to a loss of stable oscillation patterns .",
    "instead small striped - like mind - patches emerge erratically on the membrane .",
    "the second panel in figure [ sensitivity ] shows the default diffusion coefficient of @xmath58 where stable pole - to - pole oscillations emerge along the major axis . by further increasing the membrane - diffusion - coefficient",
    "the pole - to - pole oscillations still robustly emerge but increasingly smear out .",
    "this behavior is most clearly illustrated by looking at the time - averaged density profiles as shown in figure [ sensitivity ] .",
    "the inset in figure [ sensitivity ] shows that without membrane diffusion , no oscillations emerge at all ( square symbol ) , while a slow diffusivity as used in parameter set a seems optimal .    in a similar fashion we analyzed the influence of the cooperative membrane recruitment of mind .",
    "figure [ sensitivity ] shows three kymographs for no cooperative recruitment ( @xmath70 ) , the default value from parameter set a and a two - fold increase , respectively . without cooperativity in this process",
    "no oscillations emerge at all .",
    "the second panel shows again the default oscillation mode while already a two - fold increase also leads to unstable behavior without any patterns emerging .",
    "this sensitivity with respect to the cooperative recruitment rate @xmath13 is also summarized in figure [ sensitivity ] , which illustrates that only in a vary narrow range stable oscillations emerge .",
    "although a complete parameter scan is out of the question at the current stage for reasons of computer time , we conclude that stable min - oscillations emerge only for certain parameter values and that parameter set a performs very well in this respect .",
    "as we have seen in the preceding section , the simulation compartment height has little influence on the emerging oscillation modes when the membrane only covers the bottom area of the simulation compartment ( geometry a ) .",
    "however , when we extend the membrane to cover bottom and side walls of the compartment ( geometry b ) , we find that the oscillation modes change with increasing wall height .",
    "first , we consider a compartment that only exhibits longitudinal pole - to - pole oscillations along the major axis ( wall height of and bottom area of @xmath71 ) .",
    "in contrast to the flat membrane geometry a , here the mind protein density decreases in the vicinity of the membrane edges between the side walls and the bottom area , as shown in figure [ densityprofilew ] .",
    "this is due to the decreased volume per membrane area ratio in the vicinity of the membrane corners , leading to a decreased density of bound mind proteins in these regions .",
    "this effect is clearly visible by comparing the time - averaged density profile in figure [ densityprofilew ] with the one shown in [ all ] .",
    "the full oscillation pattern is shown in [ phasediagram ] for the lowest height value ( black label ) and resembles a pole - to - pole oscillation for geometry a , but now between the two opposing walls along the major axis .",
    "now we increase the wall height in increments of .",
    "the oscillation changes at a wall height of @xmath72 to a new oscillation mode ( green label , compare also supplemental movie s4 ) .",
    "there the proteins start to oscillate between the middle of the bottom area and the upper edges of the walls .",
    "this newly identified _",
    "edge oscillation _ with one polar zone at the bottom and one top polar zone at each of the four side walls persists until the wall height reaches .",
    "thereafter the oscillation mode changes to a striped edge oscillation along the walls ( yellow label ) .    in figure [ phasediagram ]",
    "we show results for a simulation volume that gives rise to striped oscillations along the major axis ( bottom area of the length of and width of ) . at a wall height of @xmath73",
    "the simulation gives rise to longitudinal striped oscillations along the major axis or transverse pole - to - pole oscillations along the minor axis .",
    "this is the same kind of bistability that we already observed in geometry a using a compartment of @xmath54 . after increasing the wall height to @xmath74",
    "the pole - to - pole oscillations along the minor axis disappear and only striped oscillations along the major axis are observed . at the wall height of @xmath75",

    "figures [ phasediagram ] and [ phasediagram ] show the kymographs for the membrane - bound proteins corresponding to figures [ phasediagram ] and [ phasediagram ] , respectively .",
    "these results demonstrate that in geometry b , both the mode selection and the detailed shape of the polar regions can be controlled by compartment height .    for an edge oscillation the free mind protein densities in the bulk of the compartment along one of the bottom area axis ( @xmath30-axis ) and along the walls ( @xmath31-axis )",

    "<S> the spatiotemporal oscillation patterns of the proteins mind and mine are used by the bacterium _ e. coli _ to sense its own geometry . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , both computer simulations and experiments have recently shown that for the same geometry of the reaction volume , different oscillation patterns can be stable , with stochastic switching between them . here </S>",
    "<S> we use particle - based brownian dynamics simulations to predict the relative frequency of different oscillation patterns over a large range of three - dimensional compartment geometries , in excellent agreement with experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> fourier analyses as well as pattern recognition algorithms are used to automatically identify the different oscillation patterns and the switching rates between them . </S>",
    "<S> we also identify novel oscillation patterns in three - dimensional compartments with membrane - covered walls and identify a linear relation between the bound min - protein densities and the volume - to - surface ratio . in general </S>",
    "<S> , our work shows how geometry sensing is limited by multistability and stochastic fluctuations . </S>"
