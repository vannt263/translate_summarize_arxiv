    "the connection between kolmogorovs 1941 ( k41 ) scaling theory of turbulence and the n - s equation is through the four - fifth law @xcite .",
    "the four - fifth law is one of the few rigorous result regarding 3d hydrodynamic turbulence , connecting the second and third order longitudinal velocity structure functions .",
    "the equation is not closed , but in the inertial range , @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the inner ( kolmogorov ) scale and @xmath3 the outer ( integral ) scale , we have @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean energy dissipation .",
    "this implies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is defined from the scaling of the longitudinal structure functions , @xmath8 .",
    "the scaling of all other structure functions are observed to deviate from the k41 prediction , which from dimensional counting would imply @xmath9 .",
    "the deviation from the k41 prediction is called anomalous scaling exponents , referring to the intermittent nature of the energy dissipation , where the energy is inhomogeneously dissipated .    as was noted recently @xcite",
    "the inviscid conservation of helicity leads to another exact scaling law for a third order correlator associated with the flux of helicity , provided an inertial range for helicity flux exists .",
    "similarly for any inviscid invariant an exact scaling law can be derived for the correlators associated with the spectral flux of such a quantity provided there is an inertial range separating sources and sinks for this quantity .",
    "this is the case for the new shell model , where the existence of a third order inviscid invariant leads to a scaling law for a fourth order correlator .",
    "this has been argued to be a calculation of an anomalous scaling exponent @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not an anomalous scaling exponent in the afore mentioned sense , it would still be present in the case of an ( imagined ) homogeneous non - intermittent flow . on the contrary , the scaling of this specific fourth order correlator will be normal in the same sense as @xmath6i from the four - fifth law .",
    "the resent interest in shell models is mainly that they show numerically the same type of intermittent behavior as seen in 3d turbulence @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the shell models makes it possible to calculate the anomalous scaling exponents with high accuracy , which is still an undo - able task for the n - s equation .",
    "so in this sense shell models might prove useful as the starting point for exact results regarding calculating scaling exponents .",
    "the introduction of the sabra model @xcite as superior to the goy model @xcite was motivated by improvements in accuracy with respects to numerical determination of scaling exponents . here",
    "the emphasis will be on the similarity with the n - s equation and the cascade properties of the third order invariant .",
    "in fact the model will not exhibit a cascade of the third order quantity , which is easily seen from a scaling argument and confirmed in a numerical simulation .",
    "thus it will be shown that the scaling exponent obtained in @xcite is irrelevant .",
    "the goy model has built in the k41 scaling in the sense that the k41 scaling is a fixed point of the model .",
    "furthermore , it has an unfortunate modulus(3 ) symmetry in shell numbers which has no resemblance in the n - s equation and which makes a precise numerical determination of scaling exponents difficult @xcite .",
    "the modulus(3 ) symmetry , furthermore , introduces artificial long range ( in @xmath10-space ) correlations with no analogs in the n - s equation .",
    "the goy model has 2 inviscid invariants , the energy and a second non - positive definite quantity dimensionally equivalent to the helicity in 3d n - s turbulence .",
    "this helicity only vaguely resembles the helicity in the n - s fluid , and it has been argued that it leads to an anomalous scaling behavior of the goy model different from the mechanisms for intermittency in n - s turbulence @xcite . a review of the main differences between the goy model and the sabra model is given in ref . @xcite .",
    "the shell model , defined in the following , can be regarded as a special case of the sabra model introduced by lvov et al .",
    "@xcite . it has the same two quadratic inviscid invariants , energy and helicity as the goy model .",
    "furthermore it has one cubic inviscid invariant .",
    "the energy is the only positive invariant . like for the n - s equation , and in contrast to the goy model ,",
    "the k41 scaling is not a fixed point of the model .",
    "the model is in the usual way defined by a set of exponentially spaced one - dimensional wavenumbers @xmath11 for which we have @xmath12 as the complex shell velocity for shell @xmath13 , the form of the governing equation for the new model is motivated from two demands .",
    "firstly , the momenta involved in the triad interactions must add up to zero like in the n - s equation .",
    "secondly , the complex conjugations involved in the non - linear term should be the same as for the terms in the spectral n - s equation involving triades for which the moduli of the wave vectors fall within three consecutive shells .",
    "this together with the usual construction of local interactions in @xmath10-space , inviscid conservation of energy and fulfillment of liouvilles theorem gives the equation of motion for the shell velocities ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the viscosity and @xmath16 is the external forcing .",
    "the forcing would as in the goy model typically be taken to be active only for some small wave numbers , ex . @xmath17 .",
    "boundary conditions can be specified in the usual way by the assignment @xmath18 .",
    "the first requirement is fulfilled if the wave numbers @xmath19 are defined as a fibonacci sequence , @xmath20 .",
    "the choice of a fibonacci sequence for the momenta leads to a model with the shell spacing uniquely being the golden ratio @xmath21 , since for any choice of @xmath22 we have @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "so this corresponds to the usual definitions of the shell wave numbers with the golden ratio as shell spacing for @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the golden ratio @xmath26 plays a key role in the symmetries of shell models .    with this formulation",
    "the shell spacing is not a free parameter of the shell model .",
    "however , using the definition by lvov et al of @xmath27 being a quasi - momentum we shall keep the shell spacing , @xmath28 , as a free parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "if we interpret the momenta , @xmath19 , as representative of the modulus of the wavevector , @xmath30 , in 2d or 3d , the triangle inequality implies @xmath31 so the fibonacci sequence corresponds in this sense to moduli of three parallel wavevectors .",
    "note that for a shell spacing @xmath32 ( as the usual choice @xmath33 ) the triangle inequality is violated .",
    "this means that we can not interpret the usual shell model interactions as representative interactions between waves within three consecutive shells , since no such triplets of wavenumbers constitutes triangles .    in order to give meaning to the notion of closing the triades",
    ", we define negative momenta , @xmath34 , and assign the velocity , @xmath35 , to these momenta .",
    "( the model still only has @xmath36 degrees of freedom , represented by the @xmath37 complex velocities ) .",
    "note that ( [ du ] ) is also fulfilled for the negative momenta , which is why the prefactor must be @xmath38 . with this notation we can rewrite ( [ du ] ) as    @xmath39    where the sum is over positive and negative momenta , and all the dimensionless interaction coefficients have the simple form , @xmath40 with @xmath41 . from this formulation",
    "it is clear why the complex conjugations in this model are exactly as in ( [ du ] ) , they arise from the closing of the triades in the same way as for the spectral n - s equation . as noted in @xcite this is the main difference from the goy model .",
    "it can easily be shown that there are only second order ( quadratic ) invariants of the form , @xmath42 .",
    "the inviscid conservation of these quadratic invariants is obtained from ,    @xmath43    so exactly as for the goy model we obtain the equation ,    @xmath44    with the two solutions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the first corresponds to energy conservation , with    @xmath47    and the second to helicity conservation ( for @xmath48 ) , with    @xmath49    with the definition of negative momenta the only possible @xmath50th order invariants with terms @xmath51 must have the associated momenta summing to zero .",
    "thus for any invariant ,    @xmath52    the corresponding momentum vectors must add up to zero , @xmath53 .",
    "this can easily be seen by differentiating ( [ psum ] ) with respect to time using ( [ du1 ] ) .",
    "the only possible third order term is    @xmath54    by taking the derivative with respect to time using ( [ du1 ] ) we obtain a set of equations similar to ( [ e2 ] ) :    @xmath55    these equations are fulfilled if @xmath56 with @xmath57",
    ". the two solutions are , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    from a similar analysis",
    "it can also be seen that there are no invariants with @xmath60 .",
    "with @xmath5 and @xmath61 being the two free parameters of the model the parameter space is represented in figure 1 .",
    "the hyperbola is the curve @xmath62 corresponding to the dimensionally correct helicity , @xmath63 .",
    "the dashed vertical lines corresponds to values where the third order quantity @xmath64 is an inviscid invariant .",
    "the point , @xmath65 , marked with a square , has both the usual helicity and @xmath66 conserved .",
    "the point @xmath67 , marked with a diamond , does not have @xmath64 conserved while the point @xmath68 , marked with a cross , has @xmath64 conserved with @xmath69 and a helicity of the form , @xmath70 .",
    "the point @xmath71 , marked with a solid ball , is the point investigated by lvov et al .",
    "corresponding to the values originally chosen for the goy model . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will investigate the case @xmath65 in order to discuss the role of the cubic invariant @xmath64 .",
    "the hamiltonian structure of the model as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite can be observed , by change of variables , @xmath72 ,    @xmath73}{\\delta v_{-n}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is defined as a hamiltonian with a density @xmath75 , which is local in wavenumber space .",
    "this relation more a curiosity than of practical importance . for shell models",
    "it would be more natural to have a hamiltonian associated with the energy as in most conservative dynamical systems .",
    "the attempt to construct this has , however , until now not been fruitful @xcite .",
    "the non - linear transfers of the invariants are defined as the currents , @xmath76 , ( @xmath77 ) , and correspondingly for @xmath78 .",
    "they are ,    @xmath79    where @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath81 the flux of @xmath64 is ,    @xmath82    where    @xmath83",
    "scaling exponents are obtained from expressing the transfers in terms of structure functions . as found in @xcite the equation ( [ du ] ) is invariant under the rotation , @xmath84 where the phases are a fibonacci sequence , @xmath85 .",
    "this symmetry is a trivial consequence of the construction of the model .",
    "the implication of the symmetry on the structure functions is that @xmath86\\langle u_{j_1} ... u_{j_p } \\rangle$ ] .",
    "thus only structure functions with @xmath87 can be non - zero .",
    "since the phases fulfill the same relations as the associated momenta we can conclude that only structure functions where the associated momenta sum to zero are non - zero .",
    "the corresponding symmetry in the goy model is @xmath88 leading to the artificial slowly decaying modulus(3 ) correlation among distant shells .",
    "this is argued in @xcite to make this model superior to the goy model .",
    "the non - vanishing structure functions can easily be listed , thus we have the following 2nd , 3rd and 4th order structure functions ,    @xmath89",
    "the exact scaling relations corresponding to the four - fifth law simply states that the mean non - linear transfers @xmath90 are independent of wave number within the respective inertial ranges in the high reynolds number limit , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 are the mean dissipations of @xmath95 respectively .",
    "this is usually expressed in terms of structure functions . from ( [ pie ] ) and ( [ s3 ] ) we readily obtain ,    @xmath96    in the inertial range , with the solution ,    @xmath97    the second term on the right hand side is an oscillatory term which is subleading in the scaling with @xmath19 in comparison to the first term .",
    "this term disappears in the case of a helicity free forcing where @xmath98 and we recover the shell model correspondence to the 4/5th law expressed in terms of the third order structure function , @xmath99 .",
    "the equation similar to ( [ s3eq ] ) for the transfer of the third order quantity , @xmath64 , reads ,    @xmath100=\\nonumber \\\\",
    "k_{n}^{2+\\alpha}f_4(n ) = \\overline{\\eta}. \\label{s4eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath101 is the mean dissipation of @xmath64 , @xmath102 denotes the square bracket on the left hand side , and @xmath103 .",
    "this was argued by lvov et al .",
    "@xcite to establish a non - trivial calculation of a ( sub - leading ) scaling exponent , which in this notation reads , @xmath104 .",
    "the imaginary part of the scaling exponent comes from the @xmath105 factor which can be trivially eliminated by reformulating the model in terms of new variables , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , as was done by lvov et al .",
    "the validity of the exact scaling relations depends on the existence of inertial ranges separating the sources and sinks for the inviscid invariants solely associated with the non - linear fluxes of the invariants .",
    "the inertial range for the energy flux is determined by the reynolds number @xmath108 , which we here just associate with the inverse of the viscosity @xmath15 , assuming velocity at the integral scale to be of order unity .",
    "the kolmogorov scale is in complete analogy to the k41 theory determined by balancing dissipation and non - linear flux , so we have @xmath109 growing as @xmath110 .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the analogous kolmogorov scale for dissipation of helicity .",
    "balancing dissipation and helicity input using @xmath111 gives , @xmath112^{1/7}$ ] .",
    "thus we get @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "this means that for high reynolds number flow the small scales will always exhibit non - helical flow . in the shell model",
    "the helicity changes sign due to the @xmath105 factor .",
    "the dissipation of positive helicity at even numbered shells and negative helicity at odd numbered shells will grow with wavenumber as @xmath115 , consequently the shell model will show strong odd - even oscillations of @xmath116 from balancing the positive and negative dissipations , the scaling will be determined by the dissipation @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "the situation for the cubic invariant @xmath64 is different .",
    "we can again define a kolmogorov scale for dissipation of @xmath64 by equating the the dissipation and the input of @xmath64 ,    @xmath119 \\sim { \\overline{\\eta}}\\ ] ]    using @xmath111 again gives ,    @xmath120^{2/5}.\\ ] ]    the ratio of dissipation scales is then @xmath121 , so as for the case of helicity the small scales will have no net non - linear flux of @xmath64 .",
    "there is , however , a crucial difference between the dissipation of @xmath78 and of @xmath64 .",
    "the dissipation of helicity is forced to be of alternating signs whereas the dissipation of @xmath64 can be of either sign at any shell .",
    "thus one should expect the mean dissipation of @xmath122 to vanish for @xmath123 , and the dissipation would not determine the scaling of @xmath124 .",
    "so how would the scaling of @xmath124 be then ?",
    "the non - linear flux @xmath124 is constituted of terms of the form @xmath125 .",
    "this leading scaling is killed by detailed cancellations between terms in an inertial range .",
    "one would then expect @xmath126 to represent a de - correlation scale where the individual terms become independent and the scaling of @xmath127 becomes approximately that of the individual terms , which is @xmath128 .",
    "this conjecture is tested in a numerical simulation .",
    "a simulation using a simple fourth order runge - kutta scheme has been performed with the parameter values , @xmath129 .",
    "the anomalous scaling exponents are defined from @xmath130 .",
    "the results for this model are show in figure 2 ( diamonds ) and coincides within the numerical accuracy of the simulation with the exponents found by lvov et al . for the sabra model with @xmath131 ( triangles ) .",
    "the non - linear fluxes for @xmath95 are shown in figures 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "the fluxes for @xmath78 and @xmath64 fluctuates between positive and negative values , so that only the absolute values are shown .",
    "the scaling indicated by the straight lines confirms the conjectures made in the previous section .",
    "however , even though the simulation is long enough and numerically accurate enough to determine the anomalous scaling exponents reliably , the non - linear flux @xmath124 can only be determined using extreme numerical precision .",
    "if we conjecture that there is a constant flux of @xmath64 of order unity @xmath132 through the inertial range we must calculate @xmath124 as differences of fourth order correlators of order @xmath128 which is about @xmath133 at the end of the inertial range to obtain a constant of order unity .",
    "so in fact the graph in figure 5 does not reliably represent @xmath124 , it is merely numerical noise . to see this",
    "consider the average @xmath134 as a function of @xmath135 , see figure 6 .",
    "the line is the curve @xmath136 which is expected for an independent random process .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath137 of the process is of the order @xmath128 .",
    "the main justification for studying shell models is the possibility of accurate numerical calculations of correlators and scaling exponents for high reynolds number flow .",
    "here we see that even the shell model can been pushed to the limit where the determination of correlators by numerical simulation is impractical .",
    "to summarize , it has been argued why this model is a natural choice for a shell model of turbulence . for the choice of parameters which conserves both energy , dimensionally correct helicity and the third order quantity @xmath64 the anomalous scaling exponents are the same as for the sabra model which conserves energy and dimensionally correct helicity but not @xmath64 .",
    "so even though the model has a hamiltonian structure , the non - positive hamiltonian , @xmath64 , seems not relevant for determining the scaling properties of the model .",
    "it has been argued that there will not be an inertial range scaling regime for the fourth order correlator associated with the flux of @xmath64 .",
    "however , due to the extreme numerical accuracy required to determine this correlator the numerical simulations presented here are not conclusive in the determination of this correlator .",
