    "we have recently developed a robust and accurate algorithm to track vortex lines in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gp ) with arbitrary geometries in a periodic domain .",
    "the full details of the algorithm and the case studies to check its validity can be found in @xcite .",
    "we recall here briefly the basic ideas .",
    "a quantised vortex line is defined by the nodal lines of the wavefunction . in three dimensions",
    "this corresponds to a line defined by @xmath67=im[\\psi(x , y , z)]=0\\ ] ] the algorithm is based on a newton - raphson method to find zeros of @xmath2 and on the knowledge of the _ pseudo - vorticity _ field @xmath68\\times \\nabla im[\\psi]$ ] , always tangent to the line , to follow vortex lines ( in the spirit of rorai et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    starting from a point @xmath69 where the density @xmath70 is below a given small threshold ( therefore very close to a vortex ) , we define the orthogonal plane to the vortex line using @xmath71 .",
    "the plane is then spanned by the two directors @xmath72 and @xmath73 as illustrated in fig.[fig : sketch ] .    ]    a better approximation for the true point @xmath74 where the vortex lies on the plane is then given by @xmath75 . here the increment @xmath76 is obtained using the newton - raphson formula : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the jacobian matrix expressed as @xmath79\\cdot \\hat{{\\bf u}}_1   &    \\nabla re[\\psi]\\cdot \\hat{{\\bf u}}_2 \\\\   \\nabla im[\\psi]\\cdot \\hat{{\\bf u}}_1 &   \\nabla im[\\psi]\\cdot \\hat{{\\bf u}}_2    \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] the increment can be therefore found using @xmath80,im[\\psi({\\bf x_0})])^t$ ] . the jacobian matrix is a non - singular @xmath81 matrix so its inverse is computed with its explicit formula .",
    "we underline that the method will require in general the evaluation of the jacobian   at intermesh points .",
    "however , making use of the spectral representation of @xmath2 , we can compute spatial derivatives of the field @xmath82 efficiently using fast fourier transforms .",
    "this process can be iterated until the true vortex location @xmath74 is determined upon a selected convergence precision .    to track the next vortex point we use as next initial guess @xmath83 , which is obtained evolving along @xmath84 by a small step @xmath85 .",
    "the process is repeated until the entire line is tracked and closed .",
    "once the line is completely tracked the process is repeated with another line until the whole domain has been fully explored .",
    "the algorithm has been extensively described and validated in @xcite using different case tests . as a final remark",
    ", we underline that the algorithm takes full advantage of the spectral resolution when a field is generated integrating the gross - pitaevskii with a pseudo - spectral method .",

    "<S> finally , the temporal evolution of the kelvin wave spectrum is obtained providing evidence of the development of a weak - wave turbulence cascade .    </S>",
    "<S> the full understanding of turbulence in a fluid is one of the oldest yet still unsolved problems in physics . </S>",
    "<S> a fluid is said to be turbulent when it manifests excitations occurring at several length - scales . due to the large number of degrees of freedom and the nonlinearity of the governing equations of motion , </S>",
    "<S> the problem is usually tackled statistically by introducing assumptions and closures in terms of correlators . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case in the seminal work of kolmogorov in 1941 based on the idea of richardson s energy cascade , where energy in classical fluids is transferred from large to small scales @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> superfluids form a particular class among fluids characterised essentially by two main ingredients : the lack of dissipation and the evidence that vortex circulation takes only discrete values multiple of the quantum of circulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> superfluid examples which are routinely created in laboratories are superfluid liquid helium ( he ii ) and bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) made of dilute alkali gases . here </S>",
    "<S> the superfluid phase is usually modelled via a complex field describing the order parameter of the system and quantised vortices appear as topological defects where the superfluid density vanishes .    in three spatial dimensions </S>",
    "<S> those defects organise themselves into closed lines ( or even open lines at the boundaries if confining sides are considered ) of different configurations . </S>",
    "<S> any vortex line point induces a velocity field in the superfluid which affects the motion of any object in the system including the vortex line itself . in general , even for a single closed vortex line , the dynamics are chaotic and the problem does not have analytical solutions . </S>",
    "<S> superfluid turbulence regards the study of the evolution of many vortex lines , a tangle , which induce velocity field gradients in the fluid at several length scales .    </S>",
    "<S> different mathematical models have been devised to mimic the dynamics of a superfluid . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the vortex filament ( vf ) model based on the biot - savart law that relates vorticity and velocity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model is able to mimic the dynamics of dense vortex tangles due to a relatively fast numerical integration technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vf model implicitly assumes that the superfluid density field is constant everywhere and the vortex structure is precisely a line with vanishing core . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is generally satisfied in he ii where the characteristic experimental setup sizes , and consequently the largest scales of the motion , are order of @xmath0 m and the vortex core is order of @xmath1 m . moreover , since helium is in its liquid phase , the compressibility effects can be usually neglected </S>",
    "<S> . however , the vf model fails to describe vortex reconnections . </S>",
    "<S> these are rapid changes in the topology of the vortex configuration which occur naturally in a superfluid @xcite and are one of the main mechanisms responsible for the energy transfer . </S>",
    "<S> reconnections are thus introduced by some ad - hoc mechanism .    another superfluid model that admits quantised vortices and inherently possesses vortex reconnections is the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation that describes the evolution of the superfluid order parameter @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the vf model , the gp equation allows density fluctuations in terms of phonons and density depletion at the vortex cores . </S>",
    "<S> although it has been formally derived as a mean - field theory for a dilute boson gas in the limit of zero temperature @xcite , it also qualitatively reproduces he ii dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex core size in the gp equation is order of the healing length @xmath3 , the only intrinsic characteristic length - scale of the model ; nowadays experimental techniques are able to create bec setups that are @xmath4 healing lengths where superfluid turbulence can develop @xcite . in turbulent superfluids , vortices </S>",
    "<S> constantly re - arrange themselves following reconnections into complex tangles with non - trivial geometrical , algebraic and topological properties @xcite . at small scales , helical excitations of vortex lines known as kelvin waves ( kws ) , are believed to be the ultimate mechanism of energy dissipation via phonon emission @xcite . to study such dynamics , the gp equation has the advantage that no extra modelling is needed ( unlike the vf model ) . </S>",
    "<S> however gp does not provide direct information on vortices .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we apply a novel numerical algorithm @xcite to track accurately the configuration of a turbulent vortex tangle evolving accordingly to the gp model . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the evolution and decay of the tangle . </S>",

    "<S> different algebraic and topological quantities of the tangle are then measured . </S>",
    "<S> the tracking allows for obtaining curvature and torsion distributions of the vortex tangle . </S>",

    "<S> competing theories have been put forward to statistically predict a power - law kw spectrum in the form of @xmath54 ( here @xmath55 is the kelvin wavenumber ) and to explain the energy transfer through kw scales . assuming small amplitude kws ( weak non - linearity ) , kozik&svistunov @xcite and lvov&nazarenko @xcite obtained the exponents @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively considering two different orders of interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the kw spectra of the @xmath58 largest rings during the evolution of the tangle applying a gaussian kernel in order to establish the unperturbed ring ( see appendix d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra , averaged over the rings , are shown for different times in fig.[fig : kwspectra]a .    . </S>",
    "<S> b ) kw spectrum at @xmath59 ( averaged over the 50 longest rings ) for run at resolution @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line displays the @xmath60 scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the inset displays the respective @xmath61 ( solid blue ) and @xmath62 ( dashed red ) compensated spectra.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is evident that all accessible kw modes get populated at early times due to reconnection events that trigger the cascade @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe kw spectra exhibiting power - laws with an exponent independent of time where the best scaling is appreciated at the time where the rings are the longest ( @xmath63 ) . to get the best estimation of the power - law exponent </S>",
    "<S> , we repeated the taylor - green decay in a simulation box twice larger ; in this new configuration the scaling range spans almost two wavenumber decades . </S>",
    "<S> in fig.[fig : kwspectra]b we show the spectrum at @xmath64 : the observed power - law exponent agrees with the lvov&nazarenko @xmath57 prediction </S>",
    "<S> . this can be better appreciated by looking at the compensated spectra with respect to @xmath65 and @xmath66 showed in the inset . </S>",
    "<S> this finding corroborates the result in favour of lvov&nazarenko s prediction previously obtained while studying the kw oscillations about a perfect straight line in the gp model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight that although the weak - wave turbulence prediction for the kw spectrum was formally derived for kws on an isolated straight vortex line using the vf model , it remarkably turns out to be valid in a dense turbulent tangle also driven by the gp model . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly due to the fact that the predicted kw spectrum was found for the longest rings . </S>",
    "<S> small rings quickly loose their energy by phonon radiation and also exchange momentum with sound waves . both contributions are important to understand dissipation of superfluids at very low temperature and further studies are still needed to fully comprehend the relevance of such mechanisms .    tracking vortices in gp turbulence opens a new way for studying and understanding the topological configuration and properties of quantum vortex tangles . although unlikely , we show that rings can link creating a local ( in time and space ) fluctuation of helicity . </S>",
    "<S> it will be of great interest to repeat a similar analysis in a gp setting where the mean helicity of the flow is not zero , like the abc flow introduced in @xcite where linking and self - linking processes could be substantially enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the results presented in this letter confirm that some predictions traditionally associated to superfluid liquid helium become important in weakly - interacting becs at low temperature described by the gp model . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays bec experimentalists are able to create and track few vortices in harmonic traps @xcite . a controlled experimental setting with a turbulent bec , such as the one presented in this letter , has yet to be achieved but it should be realisable in the near future .    </S>",
