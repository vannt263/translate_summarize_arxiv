    "a notion of _ quantum characteristic exponent _ has been introduced in ref.@xcite , which has the same physical meaning as the corresponding classical quantity ( the lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "the correspondence is established by first rewriting the classical lyapunov exponent as a functional of densities and then constructing the corresponding quantity in quantum mechanics .",
    "the construction is explained in detail in ref.@xcite , where the required functional spaces are identified and the infinite - dimensional measure theoretic framework is developed .",
    "here we just recall the main definitions and emphasize some refinements concerning the support properties of the quantum characteristic exponents , which turn out to be relevant for the numerical computations of sect.2 .",
    "expressed as a functional of _ admissible _ @xmath0densities , the classical lyapunov exponent is@xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an initial condition density , @xmath3 the perron - frobenius operator , @xmath4 a generic phase - space coordinate , @xmath5 a vector in the tangent space , @xmath6 the invariant measure and @xmath7 the gateaux derivative along the generalized function @xmath8 . the possibility to define gateaux derivatives along generalized functions with point support and the need for a well - defined @xmath9-additive measure in an infinite - dimensional functional space lead almost uniquely to the choice of the appropriate mathematical framework ,",
    "that is , _",
    "admissible densities _ are required to belong to a nuclear space .",
    "being ergodic invariants , the lyapunov exponents exist on the support of a measure . in the nuclear space framework , measures with support on generalized functions , which are in one - to - one correspondence with the usual measures in phase space ,",
    "may be constructed by the bochner - minlos theorem@xcite .    to construct , in quantum mechanics , a quantity with the same operational meaning as ( [ 1.1 ] ) let @xmath10 ( @xmath11 continuous or discrete ) be the unitary operator of quantum evolution acting on the hilbert space @xmath12 and @xmath13 a self - adjoint operator in @xmath12 belonging to a commuting set @xmath14 .",
    "for definiteness @xmath15 is assumed to have a continuous spectrum , to be for example a coordinate operator in configuration space .",
    "one considers , as in the classical case , the propagation of a perturbation @xmath16 , where by @xmath4 we mean now a point in the spectrum of @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath17 for the proper definition of the right - hand side of ( [ 1.2 ] ) one requires @xmath18 to be in a gelfand triplet@xcite@xmath19 by @xmath20 or @xmath21 we denote a generalized eigenvector of @xmath22 in @xmath23 .",
    "notice also that @xmath10 , being an element of the infinite - dimensional unitary group , has a natural action both in @xmath24 and @xmath25@xcite .",
    "one obtains then the following definition of _ quantum characteristic exponent _",
    "@xmath26    the support properties of this quantum version of the lyapunov exponent have to be carefully analyzed . in eq.([1.3 ] ) , @xmath27 defines the state which , in quantum mechanics , plays the role of a ( non - commutative ) measure@xcite .",
    "the quantum exponent may depend on the state , but the measure that , as in the classical case , provides its support is not the state but a measure in the space of the perturbations of the initial conditions , that is , in the space where the gateaux derivative operates . in the classical case",
    "these two measures coincide , in the sense that to which invariant measure in phase - space corresponds an infinite - dimensional measure in the space of generalized functions@xcite . in the quantum case , however , the two entities are different , the second one being the measure on the spectrum of @xmath15 induced by the projection - valued spectral measure and the state , that is    @xmath28    a particular case where an infinite - dimensional measure - theoretical setting , similar to the classical one , may be used to define the quantum exponents@xcite , is when the quantum evolution is implemented by substitution operators in configuration space , as in some sectors of the configurational quantum cat@xcite@xcite@xcite",
    ". however this formulation is not very useful in general and the _ state plus spectrum - measure _",
    "framework seems to be the one that has general validity . in this framework",
    "the following existence theorem holds    : let @xmath15 be a self - adjoint operator , @xmath29 a test function space in a gelfand triplet containing the generalized eigenvectors of @xmath15 in its dual @xmath23 and @xmath18 .",
    "then if @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and the following integrability condition is fulfilled @xmath34 @xmath32 , the limit in eq.([1.3 ] ) exists as a @xmath35function , that is , the average quantum characteristic exponent is defined for any measurable set in the support of @xmath36 .",
    "proof :    we write eq.([1.3 ] ) as @xmath37 then from the integrability condition ( [ 1.4a ] ) the integral of the sequence in the right - hand side of eq.([1.4b ] ) is bounded and the bolzano - weierstrass theorem insures the existence of the @xmath38 . therefore @xmath39 is well defined as a @xmath35function .",
    "@xmath40    notice that we really need the @xmath38 in the definition of the characteristic exponent because we have no natural @xmath41-invariant measure in @xmath42 to be able , for example , to apply birkhoff or kingman s theorem and prove @xmath38=@xmath43 . also the sense in which the measure @xmath36 provides the support for the quantum characteristic exponent is different from the classical ergodic theorems .",
    "we have not proven pointwise existence of the exponent a. e. in the support a measure .",
    "what we have obtained here is the possibility to define an average quantum characteristic exponent for arbitrarily small @xmath44measurable sets .",
    "other definitions of characteristic exponents in infinite - dimensional spaces have been proposed by several authors@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "they characterize several aspects of the dynamics of linear and non - linear systems .",
    "the definition discussed here , proposed for the first time in @xcite , seems however to be the one that is as close as possible to the spirit of the classical definition of lyapunov exponent .",
    "like the classical lyapunov exponent the quantum analogue ( [ 1.3 ] ) can not in general be obtained analytically .",
    "there is however a non - trivial example where it can .",
    "this is the configurational quantum cat introduced by weigert@xcite@xcite .",
    "the phase space of this model is @xmath45 .",
    "a mapping similar to the classical cat operates as a quantum kick in the configuration space @xmath46 , and the rest of the floquet operator is a free evolution .",
    "this system has the appealing features of actually corresponding to the physical motion of a charged particle on a torus acted by an impulsive electromagnetic field and , as show by weigert@xcite , to be exactly solvable .",
    "the floquet operator is @xmath47 @xmath48;\\bigskip\\ u_k=\\exp [ -\\frac i2(\\widetilde{x}\\cdot v\\cdot \\widetilde{p}+\\widetilde{p}\\cdot v\\cdot   \\widetilde{x})]\\ ] ] @xmath49 is a free evolution and @xmath50 a kick that operates in a simple manner on momentum eigenstates and on ( generalized ) position eigenstates @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 being an hyperbolic matrix with integer entries and determinant equal to 1 .",
    "the momentum has discrete spectrum , @xmath54 .    to compute the quantum characteristic exponent ( eq.([1.3 ] ) ) , let the operator @xmath15 be @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "this operator has the same set of generalized eigenvectors as the position operator @xmath57 . to construct the measure @xmath36 ( eq.([1.4 ] ) ) in the spectrum of the operator @xmath15 we can not use the energy eigenstates @xmath58 because they are not normalized .",
    "however all one requires is invariance of the measure , and using the ( normalizable ) momentum eigenstates one such measure is obtained .",
    "@xmath59 this invariant measure in this case happens to be simply the lebesgue measure in @xmath46 .",
    "defining @xmath60 the result for the quantum characteristic exponent is @xmath61 with @xmath62 for the @xmath38 the cosine term plays no role and finally @xmath63 the characteristic exponent is then determined from the eigenvalues of the hyperbolic matrix @xmath53 and is the same everywhere in the support of the measure @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) are the eigenvalues of @xmath53 , one obtains @xmath67 for a generic vector @xmath5 and @xmath68 iff @xmath36 is orthogonal to the eigenvector associated to @xmath64 .",
    "hence , in this case , one obtains a positive quantum characteristic exponent whenever the corresponding classical lyapunov exponent is also positive .",
    "this exact example will be used in sect.2 as a testing ground for the numerical algorithm and an illustration of the kind of precision problems and support properties to be expected when computing quantum characteristic exponents .    in the numerical calculation of the quantum characteristic",
    "exponents two delicate points are identified .",
    "the first is that the calculation requires a high degree of precision , because , if the exponent is positive , the derivative of @xmath69 grows very rapidly with @xmath11 .",
    "therefore in the positive exponent case acceptable statistics is only obtained by taking average values over the configuration space .",
    "second , if the situation is as in the classical case where different invariant measures coexist in phase space , the quantum exponent may depend on the state @xmath27 used to define the measure @xmath36 in the spectrum of @xmath15 . therefore , in all rigor , one should first construct stationary states and then study the @xmath70dependence of the quantum exponent .",
    "such study has not yet been carried out and , in the calculations below , a flat wave function is used as the initial state .",
    "for kicked quantum systems corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath71 the floquet operator is @xmath72 in units where @xmath73 . for the computation of the action of @xmath41 on a wave function @xmath74 , a fast fourier transform algorithm @xmath75 and its inverse @xmath76 are used @xmath77 in this way one obtains a uniform algorithm for any potential . in the configurational quantum cat , eq.([1.6 ] ) , the computation is similar with the multiplicative kick @xmath78 replaced by the substitution operator @xmath79 the quantum characteristic exponent is obtained from the calculation of @xmath80 in the limit of large @xmath11 .",
    "the precision of the algorithm is checked by insuring that @xmath81 for a small @xmath82 , and that the finite difference used to compute the derivative in ( [ 2.5 ] ) does not approach the maximum possible value allowed by the discretization .      here",
    "the configuration space is the 2-torus @xmath46 , the floquet operator is the one of eq.([1.6 ] ) , and the kick is a substitution operator with matrix @xmath83 numerically we have computed the quantities @xmath84 @xmath15 being the operator in ( [ 1.9 ] ) .",
    "the initial wave function is @xmath85 and the average is taken over the whole of configuration space .",
    "it turns out that , in this case , the derivative in the numerator of ( [ 2.8 ] ) grows so fast at some points that one reaches , after a few iterations , the maximum difference ( 2 in this case ) for the wave function at two nearby points in the discretization grid .",
    "when this happens the calculation can not be reliably taken to higher @xmath11 with that discretization . in the numerical calculation of the classical lyapunov",
    "the computation becomes a local evaluation at each step by rescaling the transported tangent vector . here , because of the linearity of matrix elements and quantum evolution , a similar procedure is not possible and one has to carefully control the growth of the quantities in ( [ 2.8 ] ) . to improve statistics",
    "the average over configuration space has been taken .",
    "this can be safely done in this case because we know exactly the supporting measure ( [ 1.10 ] ) , but in general there will be no guarantee that the supporting spectral measure is uniform . in any case average quantities like ( [ 2.8 ] ) are exactly we expect to be able to compute reliably .    fig.1 shows the evolution of @xmath86 obtained with a discretization grid of 292681 points in the unit square , for two different directions @xmath36 .",
    "the calculation was interrupted when the local finite differences reached one half of the maximum .",
    "the lines are fits to the points constrained to approach the same value at large @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting numerical estimate for the largest quantum characteristic exponent is 0.95 .",
    "the exact value obtained from ( [ 1.13 ] ) is 0.9624 .",
    "the configuration space is the circle @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xmath89 and for @xmath90 the following two possibilities were explored @xmath91 the operator @xmath15 is @xmath92 the quantity that is numerically computed is    @xmath93    and , in all cases , one starts from a flat initial wave function . in both cases and for the very many values of @xmath94 that were studied",
    ", this quantity seems either to stabilize or to have a very small rate of growth for large @xmath95 .",
    "fig.2 , for example , shows the results for the @xmath96 case with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the ( numerical ) conclusion is that the quantum characteristic exponent vanishes .",
    "this conclusion does not seem to be a numerical artifact because the discretization grid for the fast fourier transform has always been chosen sufficiently small to insure a small local finite difference for all iterations .",
    "for example in the example shown in fig.2 , the grid has 4096 points which keeps observed local differences below 0.1 .",
    "also the vanishing of the quantum characteristic exponent in quantum kicked rotators is not dependent on the phenomena of localization because also for quantum resonances it may exactly be shown to vanish@xcite",
    ".    in fig.2 @xmath99 seems to tend to a constant at large @xmath11 . in other cases very slow rates of growth",
    "are observed .",
    "this is shown in figs.3a , b for the @xmath100 case with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "both the classical lyapunov exponent ( [ 1.1 ] ) and its quantum counterpart ( [ 1.3 ] ) , measure the exponential rate of separation of matrix elements of @xmath15 when the density ( or the wave function ) suffers a @xmath103 perturbation , @xmath4 being a point in the spectrum of @xmath13 .",
    "the configurational quantum cat example shows that there are instances of _ true quantum chaos _",
    ", in the sense of exponential growth of the matrix element separation",
    ". however , as the numerical study of the quantum kicked rotators seems to show , exponential growth may be rather exceptional in quantum mechanics .",
    "furthermore the taming effect of quantum mechanics on exponential chaos goes deeper than the phenomenon of localization , because also for quantum resonances , where no localization is present , the quantum characteristic exponent vanishes .",
    "although distinct from one another , all known ways that now exist to approach the problem of quantum chaos , seem to agree in one point , namely that quantum mechanics has a definite taming effect on chaos .",
    "this is now probably the main issue in quantum chaos , not only from the theoretical point of view , but also in the context of quantum control . even if quantum characteristic exponent , as defined in ( [ 1.3 ] )",
    "might be zero in most quantum systems , the rate of growth index @xmath104 or its average @xmath105 might still be useful as a characterization of quantum dynamics because , even if weaker than exponential , a growth of this quantity would still be an indication of sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "in particular , as suggested by the numerical results , subexponential rates of growth might characterize distinct complexity classes of quantum evolution .",
