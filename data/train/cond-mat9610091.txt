    "since the discovery of the high temperature superconductors ( htsc s ) , a great number of experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to identify the symmetry of the superconducting pairing state . although there still remain controversies , it is believed that the @xmath1-wave symmetry is most probable in htsc s ; e.g. a series of strong evidences have been provided by the phase sensitive experiments@xcite .    in recent years , the structure of vortices in a @xmath1 superconductor was of great interest .",
    "it was expected that the structure of @xmath0-wave vortices might be very different from that of @xmath4-wave vortices . and connected with the vortex structure , the question of order parameter symmetry admixture arose .    from a standpoint of the spontaneous symmetry breaking , in a bulk with a perfect crystal symmetry ,",
    "the order parameter transforms according to an irreducible representation@xcite of the crystallographic point group@xcite .",
    "thus in a crystal of tetragonal ( @xmath5 ) symmetry , only one symmetry state ( e.g. @xmath1-wave ) is allowed .",
    "however near interfaces , surfaces or impurities , the crystalline symmetry is not perfect and the @xmath1-wave order parameter fluctuates spatially and hence induces components of other symmetry .",
    "this is also the case in the presence of vortices , to which we will confine ourselves in this work .",
    "soininen _ et al._@xcite , starting from a simple microscopic model hamiltonian and its bogoliubov - de gennes equation , found a substantial admixture of an induced @xmath4-wave and the dominant @xmath1-wave .",
    "based on this work , berlinsky _",
    "et al._@xcite and franz _ et al._@xcite investigated the structure of @xmath0-wave vortices using the ginzburg - landau(gl ) theory .",
    "ren _ et al._@xcite microscopically derived the gl equation from the gorkov equation of a continuum mean field model , and it was studied in detail by xu _",
    "et al._@xcite for the @xmath0-wave vortex structures .",
    "joynt@xcite also included the @xmath0-@xmath4 mixing term in their phenomenological gl model , from the symmetry argument .",
    "very recently , maki and bal - monod@xcite and won and maki@xcite also incorporated @xmath0-@xmath4 mixture .",
    "they used an interaction potential with the @xmath4 channel repulsive coulomb interaction in their weak - coupling model . in most of the works",
    "above , they observed that the @xmath4-wave component induced near the vortex core causes the @xmath0-wave component to have fourfold anisotropy,@xcite and that the vortices arrange in an oblique lattice instead of triangular one.@xcite    recently , the possibility of admixture of @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave was also suggested .",
    "koyama and tachiki@xcite took into account the internal orbital motion of the pairing electrons in their linearized gorkov - type gap equation near @xmath6 .",
    "they found that the dominant @xmath1-wave symmetry was mixed with @xmath2-wave symmetry , instead of the @xmath4-wave .",
    "the coupling of the two @xmath0-wave components led to a significant paramagnetic effect and to strong enhancement of the upper critical field at lower temperatures , which remarkably fits the experimental results on over - doped cuprate superconductors bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 and tl@xmath7ba@xmath7cuo@xmath9 . and",
    "et al._@xcite considered both @xmath1-@xmath4 mixing and @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing in the frame work of the classical eilenberger equations .",
    "they studied the isolated single vortex structures and found that the amplitude of the @xmath2-wave component has the shape of an octofoil .",
    "as described above , for the case of @xmath0-@xmath4 mixture , the single vortex and/or vortex lattice structure have been extensively studied @xcite , but not for the case of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixture . in this paper , we present analogous studies based on the gl theory which includes the mixing of @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave , assuming the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the superconducting ground state .",
    "we start with the gl free energy functional proposed by koyama and tachiki : @xmath10 where the order parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) corresponds to the @xmath1-wave ( @xmath2-wave ) symmetry . as we previously assumed , in meissner state , the only non - vanishing component is @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "other coefficients are assumed to be positive and independent of temperature .    in passing ,",
    "we make a couple of remarks . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : glmodel ] ) we included the coupling term @xmath16 , which was omitted in the model originally proposed by koyama and tachiki@xcite .",
    "this term is necessary in order to get the most general ( up to the fourth order ) free energy functional from the symmetry consideration.@xcite the mixing term @xmath17 in the quadratic order give rise to the paramagnetic current.@xcite as we will see below , it dominates other mixing terms and significantly affects the mixed state properties of @xmath0-wave superconductors .    in mean field approximation , neglecting thermal fluctuation effects , physical properties are described by the corresponding gl equations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities by adopting the fundamental length scale to be the gl coherence length @xmath18 of @xmath11 ( see table .",
    "[ table : parameters ] ) . in this case , the gl equations and maxwell equations are written as @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and other parameters are defined in the table [ table : parameters ] . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell2 ] ) , the last term is the paramagnetic current contribution .",
    "consider an isolated single vortex near the lower critical field @xmath24@xcite .",
    "for the problem of isolated single vortex , it would be convenient to decompose the order parameter into the form @xmath25 .",
    "since the @xmath2-wave component is induced through the direct coupling to the magnetic field , in the low field near @xmath24 its amplitude is expected to be very small compared with @xmath1-wave component .",
    "thus just for intuitive understanding , for a moment we neglect the effect of the coupling in the fourth order ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) . the effect will be considered below .",
    "let s first look at the phase distributions associated with the vortex .",
    "it is obvious from the rotational symmetry of the gl equations that the phases should have @xmath28 up to an additive constant@xcite , which we take to be zero ; the two @xmath0-wave components have the same winding .",
    "thus , the differential equations are rewritten , in terms of @xmath29 only , as @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "second , near the vortex center ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the asymptotic behavior of the following form : @xmath40 \\\\ % f_+(r )   & = & c_0 r\\left (      1 + c_2r^2 + { \\cal o}[r^4 ]      \\right ) \\\\ % f_-(r )   & = & d_0 r\\left (      1 + { \\cal o}[r^4 ]      \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xcite @xmath41 \\\\ d_0 & = & \\nu_2\\frac{b_0}{\\xi - b_0}\\ ; c_0 \\\\ b_2 & = & -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{c_0 ^ 2}{\\kappa^2}\\left [      1 -2\\nu_p^2\\frac{b_0}{\\xi - b_0 }       + \\nu_p^2\\left(\\frac{b_0}{\\xi - b_0}\\right)^2 \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that since @xmath42 , in the extreme type - ii superconductors ( @xmath43 ) the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath38 and @xmath44 deviates very little from those of the conventional @xmath4-wave gl theory ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "next , consider the region far from the vortex center ( @xmath47 ) . assuming the extreme type - ii superconductor ( @xmath48 ) , we can treat @xmath49 and neglect @xmath50 . then by taking the curl of eq .",
    "( [ eq : maxwell12 ] ) we get the usual london equation : @xmath51 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gl12 ] ) @xmath52 thus far outside the core , only the pure @xmath1-wave component remains .",
    "now we discuss the effect of the mixing terms in the fourth order , _",
    "i.e. _ with finite @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in general ,",
    "due to the coupling of the form @xmath55 the gl equations do not have spherical symmetry .",
    "however , within the assumption of small @xmath2-wave component , we can apply a partial wave expansion for @xmath56 : @xmath57 it is straightforward to show that the only non - vanishing component is of @xmath58 , and that the asymptotic results given above have no change .",
    "we also provide the numerical results for the distribution of the order parameter and the magnetic induction in fig .",
    "[ fig : sv ] . as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : sv ] ( a ) , the magnitude @xmath59 of the @xmath2-wave component increases as the @xmath1-@xmath2 coupling strength @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) increases and as the temperature @xmath62 decreases .",
    "however , @xmath59 is so small that its effect on @xmath44 and @xmath38 is negligible ; the isolated single vortex structure of this model is very similar to that of the conventional @xmath4-wave gl theory .",
    "in the vicinity of the upper critical field @xmath3 , the magnitudes of the order parameters are small and thus the non - linear terms in the gl equations eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gl1],[eq : gl2 ] ) are negligible .",
    "the magnetic field are also assumed to be constant all over the space since the inter - vortex spacing is much less than the penetration depth @xmath63 .",
    "then the gl equations are reduced to a linearized form : @xmath64 each of the solutions @xmath65 is just a linear combination of the wave functions in the lowest landau level , which is infinitely degenerate , and determined so as to minimize the gl free energy .",
    "we minimize the free energy by generalizing the abrikosov s procedures @xcite . in these procedures ,",
    "the two components of the order parameter satisfy @xmath66 and that the current contribution is given by @xmath67 then the magnetization@xcite and the gl free energy are given by @xmath68 @xmath69 \\label{eq : glenergy}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a still undetermined parameter , and @xmath71 with @xmath72 the abrikosov parameter @xmath73 concerns the vortex lattice structure and is determined by minimizing the gl free energy . since @xmath74 has the same form as the @xmath4-wave abrikosov solution , it is obvious that the free energy is minimized for the triangular vortex lattice ( @xmath75)@xcite . the magnetization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) shows the usual form of the conventional @xmath4-wave gl theory@xcite , but the slope @xmath76 depends on the temperature .",
    "there is no direct observation of the single vortex structure in a htsc , while keimer _",
    "et al._@xcite and maggio - aprile _",
    "et al._@xcite observed oblique lattices in their sans and stm experiments on ybco compound , respectively .",
    "their result of oblique lattice is not consistent with our result of triangular lattice . both the single vortex structure and",
    "the vortex lattice structure is also different from theoretical predictions based on the @xmath1-@xmath4 admixture scenario.@xcite    the single vortex structure can have a significant influence on the structure of the vortex lattice in many - vortex problem .",
    "it is quite interesting to note that the four - fold symmetry of @xmath0-@xmath4 admixed vortex is an implication of the mixed gradient coupling in its model . in our model",
    ", there is no mixed gradient term up to quadratic order .",
    "very recently , ichioka _",
    "et al._@xcite argued that a non - local correction is required and associated gl theory should enclose the fourth order mixed gradient term .",
    "they observed that the @xmath1-wave component has the four - lobe shape and @xmath2-wave component the shape of octofoil .",
    "although in this present paper we put emphasis on the effect of mixing through the direct coupling to the magnetic field , the result of ichioka _ et al .",
    "_ strongly suggests that the @xmath1-@xmath2 admixture can leads to an oblique vortex lattice .",
    "furthermore , even in the present gl model , for the intermediate field regime off the extreme regions near to @xmath24 or @xmath3 , the order parameter distribution is not spherically symmetric .",
    "therefore further study is required for that region , because the non - spherical symmetry of the supercurrent distribution around a vortex is not compatible with the triangular lattice symmetry .    the strong temperature dependence of @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m ] ) reminiscent of @xmath78 in the microscopic consideration of conventional superconductors by maki@xcite and eilenberger@xcite . roughly speaking , the difference between @xmath79 and @xmath80 for that case was due to the nonlocality of the electromagnetic response of the superconductors .",
    "in our case , the strong @xmath62-dependence of @xmath77 has an interesting interpretation .",
    "in contrast to the low field limit , @xmath56 is order of @xmath13 at high fields ( @xmath81 and low temperatures for @xmath82 , and the associated paramagnetic current significantly affects the magnetization curve @xmath83 in low temperature region .",
    "several experiments reported the strong temperature dependence of the slope @xmath76 near @xmath84 in htsc.@xcite",
    "we investigated a gl theory for vortex structures and magnetization in a @xmath0-wave superconductor . in the gl theory",
    ", we assumed the @xmath1-wave symmetry of the superconducting ground state , and the admixture of @xmath1-wave and @xmath2 symmetry in the presence of the vortices .",
    "the structure of an isolated single vortex was studied asymptotically and numerically at low field region ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the isolated single vortex is similar to conventional @xmath4-wave vortex , and has almost spherically symmetric supercurrent distribution around it .",
    "the vortex lattice structure and magnetization were studied analytically at high fields near the upper critical field @xmath3 .",
    "the vortices arrange in a triangular lattice , and the magnetization curve @xmath83 shows a strong temperature dependence for @xmath86 due to the paramagnetic current effect . some physical implications of the results were discussed .",
    "the results were also compared with the experimental observations and with those of @xmath0-@xmath4 scenario .",
    "it was recognized that further study in the intermediate field region is valuable .",
    "we thank t. koyama and m. tachiki very much for valuable discussions and sending us preprints . this work was supported by the seoam scholarship foundation , and by the basic science research institute program , ministry of education ( bsri-95 - 2437 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the order parameters have been defined in an unconventional way [ see koyama and tachiki ( 1996 ) ] . the time - reversal operation , which transforms @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , leaves the mixing term invariant ."
