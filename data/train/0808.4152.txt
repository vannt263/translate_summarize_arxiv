    "one of the key problems at the interface between fundamental physics and cosmology is to understand the physical mechanism behind the late - time acceleration of the universe . in principle , this phenomenon may be the result of unknown physical processes involving either modifications of gravitation theory or the existence of new fields in high energy physics .",
    "although the latter route is most commonly used , which gives rise to the idea of a dark energy component ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , following the former , at least two other attractive approaches to this problem can be explored .",
    "the first one is related to the possible existence of extra dimensions , an idea that links cosmic acceleration with the hierarchy problem in high energy physics , and gives rise to the so - called brane - world cosmology @xcite .",
    "the second one , known as @xmath0 gravity , examine the possibility of modifying einstein s general relativity ( gr ) by adding terms proportional to powers of the ricci scalar @xmath6 to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the cosmological interest in @xmath0 gravity comes from the fact that these theories can exhibit naturally an accelerating expansion without introducing dark energy .",
    "however , the freedom in the choice of different functional forms of @xmath0 gives rise to the problem of how to constrain on theoretical and/or observational grounds , the many possible @xmath0 gravity theories .",
    "much efforts within the realm , mainly from a theoretical viewpoint , have been developed so far  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) , while only recently observational constraints from several cosmological data sets have been explored for testing the viability of these theories@xcite .",
    "an important aspect worth emphasizing concerns the two different variational approaches that may be followed when one works with @xmath0 gravity theories , namely , the metric and the palatini formalisms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the metric formalism the connections are assumed to be the christoffel symbols and variation of the action is taken with respect to the metric , whereas in the palatini variational approach the metric and the affine connections are treated as independent fields and the variation is taken with respect to both .",
    "in fact , these approaches are equivalents only in the context of gr , that is , in the case of linear hilbert action ; for a general @xmath0 term in the action they give different equations of motion .    in the present paper we will restrict ourselves to the palatini formalism for gravitation and will focus on its application to the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmological model .",
    "we will derive constraints on the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath4 of the @xmath5 gravity theory from the most recent compilations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations , which includes the recent large samples from supernova legacy survey ( snls ) , the essence survey , distant sne ia observed with hst , and others , giving a sample of 307 sne ia events @xcite .",
    "we also combine the sne ia data with information from the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite and the cmb shift parameter @xcite in order to improve the sne ia bounds on the free parameters of the theory .",
    "the action that defines an @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the determinant of the metric tensor and @xmath10 is the standard action for the matter fields . treating the metric and the connection as completely independent fields , variation of this action gives the field equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the matter energy - momentum tensor which , for a perfect - fluid , is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the energy density , @xmath15 is the fluid pressure and @xmath16 is the fluid four - velocity . here",
    ", we adopt the notation @xmath17 , @xmath18 and so on . in ( [ field_eq ] ) @xmath19 is given in the usual way in terms of the independent connection @xmath20 , and its derivatives , which is related with the christoffel symbol @xmath21 of the metric @xmath22 by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we assume a homogeneous and isotropic frw universe whose metric is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the cosmological scale factor . the generalized friedmann equation can be written in terms of redshift parameter @xmath27 and the density parameter @xmath28 as ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the matter density today .",
    "the trace of eq .",
    "( [ field_eq ] ) gives another relation @xmath32 and , as can be easily checked , for the einstein - hilbert lagrangean ( @xmath33 ) eq .",
    "( [ fe3 ] ) reduces to the known form of friedmann equation .    by assuming a functional form of the type @xmath5",
    ", one may easily show that eq .",
    "( [ trace2 ] ) evaluated at @xmath34 imposes the following relation among @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath35 where @xmath36 , the value of the ricci scalar today , is determined from the algebraic equation resulting from equating ( [ trace2 ] ) and ( [ fe3 ] ) for @xmath34 .",
    "hence , specifying the values of two of these parameters the third is automatically fixed .",
    "in other words , in the palatini approach , the two parameter of @xmath37 can be thought as the pair ( @xmath38 ) or ( @xmath39 ) .    0.1 in    0.1 in",
    "since the very first results showing direct evidence for a present cosmic acceleration ( using a small number of sne ia events ) @xcite , the number and quality of sne ia data available for cosmological studies have increased considerably due to several observational programs .",
    "the most up to date set of sne ia has been compiled by kowalski _",
    "_ @xcite and includes recent large samples from snls @xcite and essence @xcite surveys , older data sets and the recently extended data set of distant supernovae observed with hst .",
    "the total compilation , the so - called _ union _ sample , amounts to 414 sne ia events , which was reduced to 307 data points after selection cuts .    in this section",
    ", we will use this sne ia sample to place limits on the @xmath40 ( or , equivalently , @xmath41 ) parametric space .",
    "this analysis , therefore , updates the results of refs .",
    "we also perform a joint analysis involving the _ union _ sne ia sample and measurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from sdss @xcite and the cmb shift parameter as given by the wmap team @xcite to break possible degeneracies in the @xmath40 plane ( for more details on the statistical analyses discussed below we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the predicted distance modulus for a supernova at redshift @xmath42 , given a set of parameters @xmath43 , is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are , respectively , the apparent and absolute magnitudes , and @xmath47 stands for the luminosity distance ( in units of megaparsecs ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ fe3 ] ) - ( [ trace2 ] ) .",

    "figure ( 1 ) shows the hubble diagram for the 307 sne ia events of the _ union _ sample .",
    "the curves stand for the best - fit @xmath0 models obtained from sne ia and sne ia + bao + cmb analysis .",
    "for the sake of comparison , the standard @xmath58cdm model with @xmath59 is also shown .",

    "we clearly see that sne ia measurements alone do not tightly constrain the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , allowing for a large interval of values for these parameters , with @xmath2 ranging from -1 to even beyond 1 , and @xmath3 consistent with both vacuum solutions ( @xmath62 ) , as well with universes with up to 90% of its energy density in the form of non - relativistic matter .",

    "this signature furnishes a standard rule which can be used to constrain the following quantity : @xmath67 where the observed value is @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the typical redshift of the sdss sample and @xmath70 is the dilation scale , defined as @xmath71^{1/3}$]with the comoving distance @xmath72 given by @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "( 2b ) we show the confidence contours ( 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% c.l . ) in the @xmath40 plane arising from this measurement of @xmath74 . as expected , since this quantity has been measured at a specific redshift ( @xmath75 ) , it forms bands on this parametric space , instead of ellipsoids as in the case of sne ia data .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath76 , which determines the whole shift of the cmb angular power spectrum , is given by @xcite @xmath77 where the @xmath78 is the redshift of the last scattering surface , and the current estimated value for this quantity is @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "note that , to include the cmb shift parameter into the analysis , the equations of motion must be integrated up to the matter / radiation decoupling , @xmath80 . since radiation is no longer negligible at this redshift , a radiation component with an energy density today of @xmath81 has been included in our analysis .",

    "note also that the best - fit value for the matter density parameter , i.e. , @xmath82 , is consistent with current estimates of the contribution of non - relativistic matter to the total energy density in the universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite showed that @xmath0 derived cosmologies in the metric formalism can not produce a standard matter - dominated era followed by an accelerating expansion . to verify",

    "figure ( 3b ) shows the effective eos as a function of @xmath85 for the best - fit solution of our joint sne ia + bao + cmb analysis .",
