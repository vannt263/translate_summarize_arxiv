    "to power the central black hole by accretion , bright quasars must consume @xmath5 solar masses during their lifetimes  roughly 1% of the stellar mass in a bright elliptical galaxy or 10% of the gaseous mass of a bright spiral .",
    "even with the assumption of a large host galaxy , an efficient mechanism is needed to channel gas to the central source .",
    "this problem of fuelling quasars is normally divided into three parts : the movement of gas from galactic scales to the inner few hundred parsecs , the instabilities of a self gravitating disk that transports the gas to a compact accretion disk and the detailed dynamics and radiation mechanisms of the final accretion . here , we consider the first problem of moving gas from galactic scales into the inner few hundred parsecs . at redshifts of 2 where the number densities of quasars peak , this has been associated with the dynamical chaos of galaxy formation ( c.f .",
    "haehelt and rees 1993 ) . at lower redshifts , interactions of galaxies leading to coalescence or merging have been proposed ( hernquist 1989 ) .",
    "these mergers can drive more than 10% of the gas to the center .",
    "the final host galaxy is the product of a merger , therefore it would be brighter than average .",
    "there are two observations that suggest a third mechanism at intermediate redshifts @xmath6 .",
    "the environment of quasars has been observed to change with redshift ( yates , miller and peacock 1989 ; hereafter ymp89 , yee and ellingson 1993 ; hereafter ye93 ) .",
    "quasars at higher redshifts are in abell richness class 0 - 1 clusters of galaxies  an environment that is considerably richer than that of lower redshift quasars ( the break point is at @xmath7 in ymp89 and @xmath8 in ye93 ) .",
    "bahcall , kirhakos and schneider ( 1995 ; hereafter bks ) used hst to image eight luminous quasars at redshifts between 0.15 and 0.3 . only three quasars in their sample have candidate hosts that are as luminous as  , the characteristic luminosity in the schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "the other five hosts must be fainter than  to have escaped detection .",
    "after observations of additional quasars , bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter bkss97 ) conclude that  the luminous quasars studied in this paper occur preferentially in luminous galaxies \" .",
    "they are rejecting the  null hypothesis \" that all galaxies are equally likely to have quasars ( e.g. a hypothesis that states that draco and the milky way are equally likely to host quasars ) .",
    "their conclusion results because at least half of all galaxies are @xmath9 magnitudes fainter than  whereas the dividing line for their sample of quasar hosts is @xmath10 within their errors .",
    "this depends slightly on the logarithmic slope of the lf .",
    "since most lfs are weakly diverging at the faint end @xmath11 , @xmath12 , a faint end cutoff is required to to define an  average luminosity \" and that average is normally 2 to 3 magnitudes brighter than the cutoff or @xmath9 magnitudes fainter than  .",
    "however , galaxies brighter than @xmath13 contain half of all the luminosity , where the range takes into accounts the uncertainty in the faint end slope and cutoff of the luminosity function .",
    "this dividing line of luminosity is consistent with the bkss97 midpoint of quasar hosts within their errors .",
    "so , quasars do nt obviously prefer brighter galaxies any more than stars do .",
    "previously , mcleaod and rieke ( 1995 ) suggested a linear relation between the absolute magnitude of the quasar and its host .",
    "bkss97 find no such relation other than what can be attributed to the obvious bias from detection limits .",
    "the simplest summary of the observations to date is that quasars and galaxies may be related much as stars and galaxies ; the probability of finding either in a galaxy is proportional to the galaxies luminosity but their individual luminosities are not determined by the luminosity of their host . hence , _ we need a mechanism that will produce quasars with a frequency per unit luminosity rather than a mechanism that only operates in bright galaxies as would be the case if mergers were the dominant trigger_.    we have found a mechanism that is extremely efficient at channeling gas into the center of sub -  galaxies that live in clusters .  galaxy harassment \" drives dynamical instabilities that send most of the gas into the central few hundred parsecs of the harassed galaxies . in  2 , we present detailed hydrodynamical simulations that show these effects , while we look at the model s predictions in  3 .",
    "we use treesph ( hernquist and katz 1989 , katz , weinberg and hernquist 1996 ) to examine the fate of a high resolution galaxy with @xmath14 particles in each of three components : gas , stars and dark matter .",
    "the simulations were originally performed to follow the morphological evolution of galaxies in clusters ( moore 1996 , moore , katz and lake 1996b ) , so the parameters were chosen to be typical of the disturbed galaxies seen by hst at redshifts of @xmath15 .",
    "we present three simulations , two with circular velocities of @xmath16 and one with a circular velocity of @xmath17 . using the fisher  tully ( 1981 ) relation , the luminosity of a galaxy with a circular velocity , @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 model galaxies have exponential disks with scalelengths of 2.5 kpc and scaleheights of 200 pc .",
    "the smaller galaxy is scaled by using the faber - jackson relation and preserving the ratio of stars , gas and dark matter .",
    "the disks are constructed with a toomre ( 1964 ) `` stability '' parameter @xmath21 and run in isolation for 2 gyr before being set into orbit in the cluster .",
    "the gaseous disk is initially on cold circular orbits .",
    "the dark halo of each galaxy is a spherical isothermal with a core radius of @xmath22 kpc , and is tidally truncated at the pericenter of the galaxy s orbit within the cluster . at 4 disk scalelengths ( 10 kpc ) ,",
    "the initial ratio of dark matter to stars to gas is 11:4:1 . at 8 disk scalelengths ( 20 kpc ) ,",
    "the ratios are 20:5:1 and the total mass is @xmath23 .",
    "the cluster model is based on coma .",
    "its one dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath24 and the mass within the virial radius ( 1.5 mpc ) is @xmath25 . for an @xmath26 of 250 ,",
    "the total cluster luminosity within this radius is @xmath27 .",
    "the other galaxies in the cluster are drawn from a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function parameterized using @xmath28 and @xmath29 including all galaxies brighter than @xmath30 ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 throughout this paper ) .",
    "this produces a model cluster that has 950 galaxies brighter than the magellanic clouds , but only 31 brighter than @xmath1 .",
    "the masses and tidal radii of the other galaxies are determined by taking an isothermal model with a dispersion given by the faber - jackson relation and tidally limiting it at the galaxy s pericentric distance .",
    "they are then modeled by spheres with a softening length equal to half of their tidal radius .",
    "most simulations have no  interpenetrating \" collisions . however , any such collision will be more gentle than a collision with a realistic model of a galaxy that is more centrally concentrated .",
    "white and rees ( 1978 ) speculated that the dark halos were stripped from galaxies within clusters ; we find that the dominant stripping mechanisms are tides and high speed encountersgalaxy harassment \" ( moore , katz and lake 1996b ; hereafter mkl96b ) .",
    "if galaxies are initially tidally limited by the cluster potential , bright galaxies retain more than half of their mass when followed for 5 gyr . for greater self - consistency , we reduced the mass of each perturber by 25% ,",
    "the average loss over a hubble time ( mkl96b ) and we left the tidal / softening radius fixed . in the accompanying video , the perturbing galaxies are shown as green dots located at their centers .    the mean ratio of a perturbing galaxy s apocenter to its pericenter in our cluster model is roughly 6-to-1 ( this ratio is even larger in infinite isothermal spheres with isotropic velocities ) ; a galaxy found at a radius of 450 kpc will have a mean orbital radius of 400 kpc and a typical pericenter ( @xmath33 ) that is slightly greater than 150 kpc .",
    "we assign galaxies masses of @xmath34 corresponding to mass - to - light ratios , @xmath35 .",
    "the luminous parts of elliptical galaxies have mass - to - light ratios of @xmath36 ( van der marel 1991 ) , so our perturbing galaxies have very modest extended dark halos .",
    "the fraction of the cluster s density attached to galaxies varies with radius from zero at the center to nearly unity at the virial radius .",
    "it is @xmath1020% at the mean orbital radius of our simulated galaxies .",
    "the rest of the cluster mass is in a smoothly distributed background represented by a fixed analytic potential .",
    "further details of the cluster model can be found in mkl96b .",
    "we have intentionally made some conservative assumptions to ensure that our results are robust . for a model galaxy on a fixed orbit ,",
    "the havoc wreaked by harassment depends on the square of the masses of the largest galaxies encountered .",
    "the most massive galaxies are giant ellipticals that are far less prone to harassment owing to their high internal densities , yet we have reduced the masses of all galaxies by the same time averaged value of 25% .",
    "at a fixed mean orbital radius , galaxies on elongated orbits experience greater harassment . we follow galaxies that have apo / peri ratios of 2 ( _ i.e. _ apocenter at 600 kpc , pericenter at 300 kpc ) , whereas the typical value is @xmath37 . as a result ,",
    "our model galaxies avoid extremes of the cluster distribution and start with large dark halo masses determined by the tidal limit at their atypically large pericenters .",
    "both effects serve to underestimate the effects of harassment .",
    "the strongest encounters do not necessarily occur near the center of the cluster .",
    "clearly , the frequency of encounters scales with the density of galaxies . however , there are two counterbalancing effects .",
    "if the galaxies are all tidally limited , they are more massive at larger cluster radii .",
    "secondly , the relative velocity of encounters decreases in the outer parts of the cluster and encounters are stronger at fixed impact parameter .",
    "as long as the encounter timscale is short compared to the internal dynamical time of the galaxy , the gas dynamical effects are strongest outside the central region of a cluster .",
    "however , galaxies near the center of the cluster are more strongly damaged by the cluster s tidal field .",
    "care was taken to ensure that our initial models were sensible and stable by simulating galaxies on circular and elliptical orbits in smooth cluster potentials before examining the effects of harassment by other galaxies .",
    "the disk of a galaxy on circular orbit at 450 kpc in a fixed cluster potential remains stable for 10 gyrs .",
    "a galaxy on an eccentric orbit with an apocenter of 600 kpc and pericenter of 300 kpc becomes bar unstable after the first pericentric passage and a bar persists for 5 billion years .",
    "each passage through pericenter results in the loss of a small fraction of dark halo material , but the gas and stars remain attached .",
    "the most dramatic evolution owes to strong encounters when the other perturbing galaxies are included ( one simulation is shown on an accompanying video ) .",
    "the first strong encounter usually causes a bar instability of greater strength than that induced by only the cluster s tidal field .",
    "the continued heating of the disk by collisions transforms the galaxy into a spheroidal galaxy that matches the brightness profile and velocity dispersions of the dwarfs in nearby clusters ( moore , lake and katz 1997 ) .",
    "perhaps the most stunning feature of the evolution is the rate that gas is driven into the center of the galaxy , as shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows snapshots of the evolution of gas disk ( also shown as the last sequence in the accompanying video ) .",
    "the angular momentum of the gas is decreased by the torques of passing collisions and internal torques between the distorted disk and the halo . when combined with radiative cooling , this drives a large fraction of the gas into the center of the galaxy as shown in figure 2 . in our first three simulations , we found that @xmath1090% , 80% and 40% of the gas is driven to the center within 3 gyrs . in the first two cases ,",
    "half of the mass is transferred in an interval of 100 - 200 myr .",
    "we note one last problem in making detailed comparisons to observations .",
    "we link the collisional deformation of a galaxy to the channeling of gas into the middle of the galaxy .",
    "the response to the jolt of a high speed fly - by encounter occurs over the galaxy s internal orbital time , @xmath38 myr ( for a half light radius of 5.6 kpc and circular velocity of @xmath16 ) .",
    "the three dimensional velocity dispersion in the cluster is @xmath39 , so each galaxy moves @xmath40 kpc through the cluster as it responds to their encounter .",
    "therefore , one can determine neither the galaxy that stimulated the encounter nor the location where the encounter occurred .",
    "we havent included star formation in our gas dynamical simulations , a weakness that we share with all past models of quasar fueling by gas in galaxies .",
    "the lack of star formation enables the gas to radiate the random energy resulting from the impulsive torques that diminish its angular momentum .",
    "if the material were all instantly turned into stars , it would not continue its inward flow and the central source would be extinguished .",
    "this caveat applies to all other models that use gas dyanmical simulations such as feuling with mergers ( _ cf .",
    "_ hernquist ) .",
    "however , we offer some observational evidence that the material does remain gas for a fairly long time .    in an accompanying paper ( moore , lake and katz 1997 )",
    ", we examine the remnants and compare them to spheroidal galaxies .",
    "we will examine the possibility of  black hole hunting \" in nucleated spheroidals in the next section .",
    "galaxy harassment only occurs in clusters where the impact velocities are too large to permit merging . by invoking this process to explain the qso hosts below  , we make four clear predictions that will each be explored in the next sections :    * quasars with low luminosity hosts should be in clusters where harassment occurs",
    ", * resolved hosts should appear disturbed , * regions where harassment is ongoing should show an enhanced quasar frequency * black holes should exist in some nucleated spheroidal galaxies      early studies of the environments of quasars concluded that they were not in rich clusters ( roberts , odell and burbidge 1977 , stockton 1978 , french and gunn 1983 ) . that picture has changed and it is now clear that many low redshift quasars are in rich clusters .",
    "the majority of these may lie at the edge of the cluster ( @xcite , green and yee 1984 , yee 1989 ) , but there are a few such as h 1821 + 643 ( schneider 1992 ) and 3c 206 ( yee 1989 ) that appear to lie at the center .",
    "many other quasars show excesses of close optical companions ( hutchings , crampton and campbell 1984 , dahari 1984 , heckman 1984 and yee 1986 ) .",
    "heckman ( 1984 ) obtained redshifts for 15 optical companions and found that 14 out of 15 were physical companions not projections .",
    "several groups have found that the clustering properties of quasars change rapidly with redshift .",
    "ymp93 find that quasars with redshifts @xmath0 occur in abell richness class 0 - 1 clusters of galaxies , an environment that is roughly three times richer than that of the lower redshift quasars .",
    "ye93 reach a similar conclusion , but place the redshift break slightly higher ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "fisher ( 1996 ; hereafter fbks ) looked at a sample of ( @xmath42 ) with a mean redshift of @xmath43 .",
    "they conclude that the quasars reside in stuctures that have at least half as many members as richness class r=0 abell clusters .",
    "so , there seems to be a smooth trend with redshift .",
    "these results agree qualitatively with our model , where the chaos of galaxy formation remains the reason for the observed peak of quasar number densities at a redshift of 2 and merging could dominate at the present day . in the standard hierarchical clustering model , kaufman ( 1995 )",
    "has shown that the infall rate of field galaxies into clusters peaks at redshifts of 0.30.5 . at these redshifts , infalling galaxies",
    "are harassed to produce the central gas flow needed to create a quasar .",
    "the real test will be a measurement of the evolution of the galaxy  galaxy and quasar  galaxy correlation functions to @xmath8 .",
    "we can also examine what is known about the environments of the quasars in the bks95 sample .",
    "bks95 found 7 companions within 25 kpc of their targets , whereas they estimate the chance occurrence should be 0.375 per target .",

    "however , we are encouraged by the structures described for the two less luminous hosts . strong bars and rings",
    "are often seen in harassed galaxies .",
    "the phenomena of galaxy harassment was discovered in our study of the destruction of substructure in mergers ( mkl96b ) . in moore ( 1996 ) , we first applied it to explain the evolution of cluster populations discovered by butcher and oemler ( 1978 ) .",
    "harassment is clearly occurring in these clusters .",
    "if this is the cause of nuclear activity in quasars found in sub -  galaxies , then we expect that the frequency of agns should be higher in clusters at @xmath46 that show the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "we find the data to check this prediction to be extremely puzzling .",
    "when they first embarked on their decade long spectroscopic study of these clusters , dressler and gunn ( 1982 , 1983 , see also dressler 1987 ) reported that the frequency of agns in these clusters was much higher than the 1% found in @xmath47 clusters ( dressler , thompson and shectman 1985 ) .",

    "we do note that our first and third predictions have some redundancy .",
    "quasars at intermediate redshifts could not lie in clusters rich enough to be classified by abell ( yates , miller and peacock 1989 , and yee and ellingson 1993 ) if nuclear activity is not enhanced in clusters .      with sensible assumptions about their duty cycle ,",
    "the dead remnants of quasars are inferred to have number densities comparable to galaxies brighter than  ( c.f . haehelt and rees 1993 and references therein ) .",

    "our candidate hosts have a much greater spatial frequency and are associated with quasars at lower redshifts where they are relatively rare .",
    "hence , a tiny fraction of the spheroidals are expected to have massive nuclei .",
