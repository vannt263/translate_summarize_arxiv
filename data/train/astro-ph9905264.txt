    "the spectroscopic study of the blue and near - uv region around @xmath04000    has proven to be a useful tool to investigate the stellar populations of composite stellar systems .",
    "obviously , this spectral region is specially suited to detect the presence of young stars and therefore , to study star formation histories .",
    "furthermore , in a pioneering work , morgan ( 1959 ) already showed that the difference in intensity of the continuum level on the two sides of h@xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) in galactic globular clusters correlated well with metal abundance .",
    "although different absorption line - strength indices have been defined in this spectral range to understand the stellar composition of early - type objects ( e.g. , faber 1973 ; burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; rose 1984 , 1994 ; tripicco 1989 ; worthey et al .",
    "1994 , hereafter w94 ; jones & worthey 1995 ; worthey & ottaviani 1997 ; vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ) , some of them are quite dependent on spectral resolution ( and therefore velocity dispersion ) and , in many cases , their use requires relatively high signal - to - noise ratios . in this sense , an interesting spectral index that avoids these problems",
    "is the @xmath04000    break .",
    "we have already demonstrated ( cardiel et al . 1998 ) that this discontinuity can be measured with a relative error of @xmath4% with a signal - to - noise ratio per   @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the break is well suited to be measured in faint objects or at low surface brightnesses .",
    "however , this advantage , due to the large wavelength interval employed in its definition , also translates into an important drawback : many absorption lines are included in the break bandpasses .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of the break is expected to be complex .    in this work",
    "we are using the definition adopted by bruzual ( 1983 ) , who defined this spectral index as the ratio of the average flux density , @xmath6 ( erg s@xmath7 @xmath8 hz@xmath7 ) , in two bands at the long and short  wavelength side of the @xmath04000    discontinuity , in particular @xmath9 where . except for the combination of @xmath10 and @xmath0 , ( due to the measurement method employed by bruzual , in which the break was obtained from galaxy spectra plotted as @xmath6 versus @xmath0 ) , and for not being in logarithmic units",
    ", this definition resembles that of a color .",
    "because of this , the d@xmath1 can be considered as a pseudo - color .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that , compared to the classical color indices in this spectral range ( like @xmath11 ) , the 4000    break is much less sensitive to extinction by dust , and hence , it is more valuable to investigate the stellar content of galaxies .",
    "in particular , using the average interstellar extinction curve from savage & mathis ( 1979 ) , the d@xmath1 can be corrected from internal reddening ( and galactic extinction for objects at zero redshift ) using the following expression @xmath12 it is interesting to note that the break definition is still the same for redshifted objects , where the integral limits must be properly modified , and that absolute fluxes are not required . as a working expression ,",
    "the 4000    break can be rewritten as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the flux density per unit wavelength ( in arbitrary units ) , and @xmath15  is the redshift of the object being measured .    up to date , many authors have employed the d@xmath1 to study the stellar composition and star formation history of early - type galaxies ( e.g. mcclure & van den bergh 1968 ; spinrad 1980 , 1986 ; bruzual 1983 ; laurikainen & jaakkola 1985 ; hamilton 1985 ; dressler 1987 ; dressler & shectman 1987 ; johnstone et al .",

    "1991 ; charlot et al . 1993 ; charlot & silk 1994 ; davidge & clark 1994 ; songaila et al . 1994 ; belloni et al . 1995 ; davidge & grinder 1995 ; cardiel et al .",

    "the reliable analysis of the break measurements rests on the comparison of the data with the predictions of stellar population models ( e.g. worthey 1994 ; bruzual & charlot 1996 ) .",
    "so far , such predictions are computed by using either model atmospheres , or stellar libraries with a poor coverage of the atmospheric parameter space , especially in metallicity .    in this paper",
    "we present an empirical calibration of the @xmath04000  break as a function of the main atmospheric stellar parameters ( namely effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity ) in an ample stellar library which covers an appropriate range of parameters to study relatively old stellar populations .",
    "one of the main advantages of using fitting functions to describe the behaviour of spectral indices is that they allow stellar population models to include the contribution of all the required stars , through a smooth interpolation in the space defined by the fitted stellar parameters .",
    "the usefulness of this approach has been demonstrated by the successful inclusion of similar fitting functions in recent evolutionary synthesis models ( eg .",
    "worthey 1994 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ; bressan et al . 1996",
    "; bruzual & charlot 1996 ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the empirical calibration is only a mathematical representation of the break behaviour as a function of atmospheric stellar parameters , and that we do not attempt to obtain any physical justification of the derived coefficients .",
    "we briefly review the previous works devoted to understand the d@xmath1 in section  2 .",
    "the star sample is given in section  3 .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section  4 , whereas section  5 contains a description of the error analysis . in section 6",
    "we show the behaviour of the measured d@xmath1 values as a function of the stellar atmospheric parameters .",
    "the fitting strategy and the resulting empirical function are presented in sections  7 .",
    "finally , in section  8 we give a summary , providing a public fortran subroutine written by the authors to facilitate the computation of the d@xmath1 using the fitting function presented in this paper .",
    "sections  4 and  5 are rather technical , due to the inclusion of a lengthy explanation of the data and error handling .",
    "we suggest the reader not interested in such details to scan tables  [ tabletotal ] and  [ tableruns ] , and skip those sections .",
    "the @xmath04000    break is a sudden onset of absorption features bluewards 4000    which is clearly noticeable for stellar types cooler than g0 ( see fig .",
    "[ plotspt ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ figd4000detailed ] we show a typical spectrum of a cool star in this spectral region , together with the identification of the most prominent spectral features . considering the large wavelength range employed in the measurement of the d@xmath1",
    ", it is expected the strength of this discontinuity to be a function of the distribution of the continuum light in this region ( governed by the effective temperature ) modulated by the absorption line strengths ( which must depend primarily on both temperature and metallicity , and secondly on gravity ) .",
    "this behaviour converts the break in a potential tool to investigate composite stellar populations in early - type systems .",
    "the relevance of the line - blanketing discontinuity near @xmath04000    was the object of a systematic study by wildey et al .",
    "these authors measured the _ energy subtracted _ in the spectra of some stars due to fraunhofer lines , showing that the effect was important below @xmath04000   .",
    "van den bergh ( 1963 ) , and van den bergh & sackmann ( 1965 ) defined a break , @xmath16 , as the ratio of the smoothed observed continuum at both sides of @xmath04000   .",
    "these authors measured this break in a sample of 200  stars concluding that @xmath16 depended both on stellar metallicity and b@xmath17v color .",
    "analogous discontinuity definitions , like ( mcclure & van den bergh 1968 ) , and ( carbon et al .",
    "1982 ) , have been also employed in the spectroscopic analysis of stars , star clusters and galaxies .",
    "using spectrophotometric stellar libraries , bruzual ( 1983 ) and hamilton ( 1985 ) studied the variation of the @xmath04000    break with spectral types and luminosity classes ( compare fig .  3 in bruzual with fig .",
    "6 in hamilton ) .",
    "both authors concluded that , as a function of temperature , the d@xmath1 increases slowly for spectral types in the range from o5 to g0 , and faster from g0 to m0 , whereas the break decreases for the later types , m0 to m5 .",
    "in addition , whilst for spectral types hotter than g0 the break does not depend on gravity , a clear dichotomy between main sequence stars on one hand , and giant and supergiant stars on the other , is apparent for lower temperatures . given the scarcity of the employed stellar libraries , no dependence on metallicity could be obtained in these works .    from the analysis of moderate - resolution spectra of 950 galaxies in 12 rich clusters ,",
    "dressler & shectman ( 1987 ) argued that , in composite stellar populations , the break is insensitive to changes in metal abundance , at least in the metallicity range spanned by their galaxy sample .",
    "this result was employed by munn ( 1992 ) to conclude that the cn ",
    "d@xmath1 diagram is effective at separating metallicity and age effects on the integrated spectra of early - type galaxies .",
    "however , kimble et al . ( 1989 ) obtained that the break correlated strongly with metallicity indicators , such as the mgb index .",
    "more recently , poggianti & barbaro ( 1997 ) , working with kurucz s models , have obtained a theoretical calibration of the break as a function of stellar parameters .",
    "they present ( fig .  1 in their paper ) the behaviour of the d@xmath1 in the ranges , , and .",
    "this work clearly shows the strong dependence of the break on effective temperature , as previously reported from the studies based on stellar libraries , and quantifies , for a small sample of temperatures , the variation of the break as a function of metallicity and gravity .",
    "the d@xmath1 is shown to be insensitive to metallicity for hot stars ( @xmath18  k ) , whereas the contrary is true for  k. in addition , using the stellar spectra of straizys & sviderskiene ( 1972 ; note that these spectra are those also employed by bruzual 1983 ) , these authors obtain that , for stars with , the d@xmath1 always exhibits values above 2 , with a maximum of 3 at . using this theoretical calibration , barbaro & poggianti ( 1997 )",
    "have also elaborated an evolutionary synthesis model which predicts , in the integrated spectrum of a galaxy , the variation of the d@xmath1 as a function of the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "more interestingly , they conclude that the break can be employed to yield the ratio of the sfr averaged over the last 5 billion years to the present sfr .    from all these previous works ,",
    "it is quite clear that the d@xmath1 is a suitable tool to face the study of stellar systems , in particular to reveal their stellar composition .",
    "however , a detailed empirical calibration , such as that presented in this paper , is needed to i ) overcome the unavoidable uncertainties associated to the theoretical calibrations , ii ) extend our understanding of the break behaviour for stars with @xmath19 k ( note that these late - type stars constitute a fundamental ingredient in the modeling of old stellar populations ) , and iii ) use in conjunction with other indices previously calibrated with the same stellar library .",
    "in order to derive a confident empirical calibration of the d@xmath1 , we decided to measure this spectral feature in all the stars belonging to the lick / ids library ( burstein et al . 1984 ; faber et al .",
    "1985 ; burstein et al .",
    "1986 ; gorgas et al .",
    "1993 , hereafter g93 ; and worthey et al .",
    "the suitability of the lick / ids library to obtain empirical fitting functions has been widely demonstrated by the works of g93 , w94 , and worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) , who , in overall , have derived analytical expressions for 25 spectral indices in the  region .",
    "trager et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and references therein , have extensively shown the usefulness of the lick / ids absorption - line index system in the study of old stellar populations . in brief , the lick / ids library contains 460 stars of all spectral types and luminosity classes .",
    "although a large fraction are field stars from the solar neighbourhood , members of open clusters ( covering a wide range of ages ) and galactic globular clusters ( with different metallicities ) are also included .",
    "table  [ tabletotal ] lists the final data sample , which comprises 392 stars out of the original set of 424 objects with published atmospheric parameters in w94 ( the remaining 32 stars presented high uncertainties in the derived measurements and were not included in order to guarantee the quality of the final dataset ) .",
    "the first two columns list the henry draper catalog number , if any , and other common designation .",
    "the spectral type and luminosity class are given in the third column ( see references at the end of the table ) .",
    "the following three columns list the atmospheric parameters employed in this work .",
    "most of them are those listed in the electronic table of w94 . since we wish to keep the consistency with the previous fitting functions for the lick indices , we have been reluctant to change any atmospheric parameter .",
    "however , we have introduced new parameters for some of the stars which lack them in w94 , and , in some cases , the original parameters have been improved using more recent or reliable data from the literature ( see the description in the table notes ) . as a whole , effective temperature , gravity and metallicity data",
    "are finally available for 383 , 382 and 354 stars , respectively .    to summarize , the lick / ids library spans the following ranges in atmospheric parameters : @xmath20 from 2747 to 21860  k , @xmath21 from 0 to 5.12 , and [ fe / h ] from @xmath22 to 0.46 .",
    "it is important to note that the star sample does not homogeneously cover the parameter space , being more densely populated in the metallicity interval @xmath171.0  dex to + 0.5  dex , whereas the gravity range is wider close to solar metallicity .",
    "a more important deficiency of the library is the paucity of hot stars .",
    "since we are also interested in applying the derived fitting functions to the modeling of younger stellar populations , we have enlarged the sample with the inclusion of additional hot stars .",
    "for this purpose , we have employed flux - calibrated spectra corresponding to representative spectral types and luminosity classes from the compilation of pickles ( 1998 ) . in particular , 43 spectra of o5f0 stars with @xmath23  k have been incorporated .",
    "it is worth noting that we have checked that no systematic offset is apparent between our d4000 measurements and those in pickles spectra . to display the range of stellar parameters covered by the resulting library , in fig  [ hrdiag ] we present a @xmath21@xmath20 diagram of the calibrating stars .

    "we have derived a set of empirical fitting functions describing the behaviour of the break at @xmath24   in terms of the atmospheric stellar parameters : effective temperature , metallicity and surface gravity .",
    "this calibration can be easily incorporated into stellar population models to provide accurate predictions of the d@xmath1 for composite systems . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will analyze the measurements of the break in old stellar populations at the light of the predictions of such models .",
    "considering the volume covered by the employed stellar library ( lick / ids @xmath25 pickles hot subsample ) in the stellar parameter space , the derived fitting functions suit the requirements to provide accurate d@xmath1 predictions for populations with ages larger than about 0.1  gyr , and @xmath26 } \\le + 0.5 $ ]  dex ( see also w94 ) .",
    "note however that , since the break could be contaminated by nebular emission in galaxies with ongoing star formation , it is necessary to include this effect in the population modelling in order to predict reliable d@xmath1 indices for such stellar populations .",
    "it should also be noted that the applicability of the derived fitting functions is safe as far as the abundance ratios of the library stars reflect those in the modeled stellar populations .    in order to facilitate the usage of the present d@xmath1 fitting functions",
    "we have written a fortran subroutine , available from : + http://www.ucm.es/info/astrof/d4000/d4000.html .",
