    "an ontology is expressed as a knowledge base ( kb ) .",
    "inconsistency is not rare in ontology applications and may be caused by several reasons , such as errors in modeling , migration from other formalisms , ontology merging , and ontology evolution .",
    "therefore , handling inconsistency is always considered an important problem in dl and ontology management communities . however ,",
    "dl - lite reasoning mechanism based on classical dl semantics faces problem when inconsistency occurs , which is referred to as the triviality problem .",
    "that is , any conclusions , that are possibly irrelevant or even contradicting , will be entailed from an inconsistent dl - lite ontology under the classical semantics .    in many practical ontology applications ,",
    "there is a strong need for inferring ( only ) useful information from inconsistent ontologies .",
    "for instance , consider a simple dl - lite kb @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 . under the classical semantics for dls ,",
    "anything can be inferred from @xmath3 .",
    "intuitively , one might wish to still infer @xmath4 and @xmath5 , while they are useless to derive both @xmath6 and @xmath7 from @xmath3 .",
    "there exist several proposals for reasoning with inconsistent dl - lite kbs in the literature .",
    "these approaches usually fall into one of two fundamentally different streams . the first one is based on the assumption that inconsistencies are caused by erroneous data and",
    "thus , they should be removed in order to obtain a consistent kb ( @xcite ) . in most approaches in this stream ,",
    "the task of repairing inconsistent ontologies is actually reduced to finding a maximum consistent subset of the original kb .",
    "a shortcoming of these approaches is the so - called _ multi - extension problem_. that is , in many cases , an inconsistent kb may have several different sub - kbs that are maximum consistent .",
    "the other stream , based on the idea of living with inconsistency , is to introduce a form of paraconsistent reasoning or inconsistency - tolerant reasoning by employing non - standard reasoning methods ( e.g. , non - standard inference and non - classical semantics ) . @xcite",
    "introduce some strategies to select consistent subsets from an inconsistent kb as substitutes of the original kb in reasoning .",
    "@xcite present the belnap s four - valued semantics of dls where two additional logical values besides  true \" and  false \" are introduced to indicate contradictory conclusions . @xcite present the hunter s quasi - classical semantics of dls whose strong semantics",
    "strengthens the inference power of four - valued semantics .",
    "however , the reasoning capability of such paraconsistent methods is not strong enough for many practical applications .",
    "for instance , a conclusion @xmath8 , that can inferred from a consistent kb @xmath3 under the classical semantics , may become not derivable under their paraconsistent semantics .",
    "we argue that approaches in these two streams are mostly _ coarse - grained _ in the sense that they fail to fully utilize semantic information in the given inconsistent kb .",
    "for instance , when two interpretations make a concept unsatisfiable , one interpretation may be more reasonable than the other .",
    "but existing approaches to paraconsistent semantics in dls do not take this into account usually",
    ".    recently a distance - based semantics presented by @xcite has been proposed to deal with inconsistent kbs in propositional logic .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to generalize this approach to dls because a dl kb can have infinite number of models and a model can also be infinite . additionally , it is also a challenge in adopting distance - based semantics for dl complex constructors .    to overcome these difficulties , in this paper",
    "we first use the notion of _ features _ @xcite and introduce a distance - based semantics for paraconsistent reasoning with dl - lite .",
    "feature in dl - lite are herbrand interpretations extended with limited structure , which provide a novel semantic characterization for dls .",
    "in addition , features also generalize the notion of _ types _ for tboxes @xcite to general kbs .",
    "each kb in dl - lite has a finite number of features and each feature is finite .",
    "this makes it possible to cast arieli s distance - based semantics to dl - lite .",
    "the main innovations and contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "we introduce distances on _ types _ of @xmath9 kbs , which avoids the problem of domain infiniteness and model infiniteness in defining the distance in terms of models of kbs . based on the new distance on types",
    ", we develop a way of measuring types that are closest to a tbox and the notion of _ minimal model types _ is introduced .",
    "this notion is also extended to _ minimal model features _ for kbs .",
    "we propose a distance - based semantics for @xmath9 so that useful information can still be inferred when a kb is inconsistent .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing a novel entailment relation ( i.e. distance - based entailment ) between a kb and an axiom in terms of minimal model features .",
    "our results show that the distance - based entailment is paraconsistent , non - monotonic , cautious as the paraconsistent based on multi - valued semantics .",
    "we also show that the distance - based entailment is not over - skeptical in the sense that for a classically consistent kb , the distance - based entailment coincides with the classical entailment , which is missing in most existing paraconsistent semantics for dls .",
