    "this paper investigates the problem of estimating the posture of human hands using sensing devices , and how to improve their performance based on the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands .",
    "similarly to the companion paper @xcite , this work is motivated by studies on the human hand in grasping tasks @xcite suggesting hand posture representations of increasing complexity ( `` synergies '' ) , which allow to reduce the number of degrees of freedom ( dofs ) to be used according to the desired level of approximation . in @xcite",
    ", we analyzed the role of the _ a priori _ information for pose hand reconstructions by using given sensing devices , and showed that acceptable reconstruction results can be obtained even in presence of insufficient and inaccurate sensing data .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis to consider the optimal design of sensing `` gloves '' , i.e.  devices for hand pose reconstruction based on measurements of few geometric features of the hand .",
    "the problem we consider is to find the distribution of a number of sensing elements of limited accuracy so as to provide , together with the _ a priori _ information , the optimal design which minimizes in probability the reconstruction error .",
    "the problem becomes particularly relevant when limits on the production costs of sensing gloves introduce constraints limiting both the number and the quality of sensors . in these cases ,",
    "a careful design of sensor distribution is instrumental to obtain good performance .",
    "optimal experimental design represents a challenging , widely discussed topic in literature @xcite . among all optimal design criteria ,",
    "bayesian methods are ideally suited to contribute to experimental design and error statistics minimization , when some information is available prior to experimentation ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) . on the contrary",
    ", non bayesian criteria are adopted when a linear gaussian hypothesis is not fulfilled and/or when the designer s primary concern is to minimize worst - case sensing errors rather than error statistics .",
    "criteria on explicit worst - case / deterministic bounds on the errors and tools from the theory of optimal worst - case / deterministic estimation and/or identification are discussed e.g.  in  @xcite .",
    "however , most of these approaches refer to cases with a number of basic sensors which is redundant or at least equal to the number of variables to be estimated . moreover , no previous example of application to the peculiar problem of exploiting the a priori psychophysical information on the structure of human hand embodiment for under  sensorized gloves has ever been reported . in  @xcite an investigation of `` whole - hand '' interfaces for the control of complex tasks",
    "is presented , along with the description , design , and evaluation of whole - hand inputs , based on empirical data from users . in  @xcite authors",
    "discussed the properties , advantages , and design aspects associated with piezoelectric materials for sensing glove design , in an application where the device is used as a keyboard .",
    "finally ,  @xcite authors explored how to methodically select a minimal set of hand pose features from optical marker data for grasp recognition .",
    "the objective is to determine marker locations on the hand surface that is appropriate for grasp classification of hand poses .",
    "all the aforementioned approaches rely on experimental or qualitative observations : from actual sensor data , locations that provide the largest and most useful information on the system are chosen .    in this paper , we investigate in depth the problem of obtaining the optimal distribution of sensors minimizing in probability the reconstruction error of hand poses .",
    "we adopt a classical bayesian approach to minimize the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix norm and hence , to maximize the information on the real hand posture available by the glove measurement .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix , @xmath0@xmath1 , which directly depends on the sensor design through the measurement matrix @xmath2 , its noise covariance @xmath3 , and on the _ a priori _ information @xmath4 , represents a measure of the amount of information that the observable variables carry about the unknown pose parameters . here",
    "we explore the role of the measurement matrix @xmath2 on the estimation procedure , providing the optimal design of a sensing device able to get the maximum amount of the information on the actual hand posture .",
    "we first consider the _ continuous _ sensing case , where individual sensing elements in the glove can be designed so as to measure a linear combination of joint angles .",
    "an example of this type is the sensorized glove developed in  @xcite ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuoussensing ] ) , or the 5dt data glove ( 5dt inc . , irvine , ca - usa ) .",
    "other devices , such as e.g. the cyberglove ( cyberglove system llc , san jose , ca - usa ) , or the humanglove ( humanware s.r.l . , pisa , italy ) shown in figure  [ fig : discretesensing ] , provide instead _ discrete _ sensing , i.e.  each sensor provides a measure of a single joint angle .    finally , for the sake of generality , we consider the optimal design of hybrid sensing devices , which combine continuous and discrete sensors .",
    "it is interesting to note that human hands represent , to some extent , examples of such hybrid sensing : among the cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the dorsal skin of the hand that were demonstrated to be involved in the responses to finger movements , @xcite includes both fast adapting ( mainly fai ) afferents , with localized response to movements about one or , at most , two nearby joints ; and slow adapting ( sa ) afferents , whose discharge rate is influenced by several joints interactively .",
    "note also that fa units are found primarily close to joints , while sa units are more uniformly distributed .    to validate our technique we consider hand posture reconstruction using a limited number of measurements from a set of grasp postures acquired with an optical tracking system , providing accurate reference poses . experiments and statistical analyses",
    "demonstrate the improvement of the estimation techniques proposed in @xcite by using the optimal design proposed in this paper .",
    "for reader s convenience we summarize here the definitions and results of  @xcite used in the following .",
    "let us assume a @xmath5 degrees of freedom kinematic hand model and let @xmath6 be the measures provided by a sensing glove .",
    "the relationship between joint variables @xmath7 and measurements @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is a full row rank matrix , and @xmath12 is a vector of measurement noise . in  @xcite ,",
    "the goal is to determine the hand posture , i.e.  the joint angles @xmath13 , by using a set of measures @xmath8 whose number is lower than the number of dofs describing the kinematic hand model in use . to improve the hand pose reconstruction",
    ", we used postural synergy information embedded in the _ a priori _ grasp set , which is obtained by collecting a large number @xmath14 of grasp postures @xmath15 , consisting of @xmath5 dofs , into a matrix @xmath16 .",
    "this information can be summarized in a covariance matrix @xmath17 , which is a symmetric matrix computed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a matrix @xmath20 whose columns contain the mean values for each joint angle arranged in vector @xmath21 .",
    "based on the minimum variance estimation ( mve ) technique , in  @xcite we obtained the hand pose reconstruction as @xmath22 where matrix @xmath23 is the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix .",
    "when @xmath3 tends to assume very small values , the solution described in   might encounter numerical problems .",
    "however , by using the sherman - morrison - woodbury formulae , can be rewritten as @xmath24 and the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix becomes @xmath25 .",
    "the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix , which depends on measurement matrix @xmath2 , represents a measure of the amount of information that an observable variable carries about unknown parameters . in this paper",
    "we will explore the role of the measurement matrix @xmath2 on the estimation procedure , providing the optimal design of a sensing device able to obtain the maximum amount of the information on the actual hand posture .",
    "let us preliminary introduce some useful notations .",

    "@xmath29 of @xmath26 and @xmath30 is an orthogonal matrix whose columns @xmath31 are the eigenvectors of @xmath26 , known as principal components ( pcs ) of @xmath26 , associated with @xmath32 .",
    "for example , the svd of the _ a priori _ covariance matrix is @xmath33 , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the singular values and the principal components of matrix @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we first analyze the case that individual sensing elements in the glove can be designed to measure a linear combination of joint angles ( continuous sensing devices ) , and provide , for given _ a priori _ information and fixed number of measurements , the optimal design , minimizing in average the reconstruction error .",
    "we then consider the case where each measure provided by the glove corresponds to a single joint angle ( discrete sensing devices ) .",
    "for these types of gloves we determine which joint should be individually measured in order to optimize the design .",
    "finally , we will consider the case that both continuous and discrete sensor elements are used in the achieve sensing devices , defining a procedure to obtain the optimal hybrid sensing glove design",
    ".    in the ideal case of noiseless measures ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 becomes zero when @xmath2 is a full rank @xmath5 matrix , meaning that available measures contain a complete information about the hand posture . in the real case of noisy measures and/or when",
    "the number of measurements @xmath39 is less than the number of dofs @xmath5 , @xmath38 can not be zero . in these cases ,",
    "the following problem becomes very interesting : find the optimal matrix @xmath40 such that the hand posture information contained in the fewer number of measurements is maximized . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath2 to be full row rank and we consider the following problem .",
    "[ prob : optimalh1 ] let @xmath2 be an @xmath41 full row rank matrix with @xmath11 and @xmath42 be defined as @xmath43 , find @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the frobenius norm defined as @xmath46 , for @xmath47 .    to solve problem  [ prob : optimalh1 ] means to minimize the entries of the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix : the smaller the values of the elements in @xmath38 , the greater is the predictive efficiency .",

    "we first consider the case of noiseless measures , i.e.  @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath56 be a non - negative matrix of order @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that , for any given matrix @xmath57 of rank @xmath39 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the eigenvalues of @xmath56 , and the minimum is attained when @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the eigenvector of @xmath56 associated with @xmath60 . in other words ,",
    "the choice of @xmath57 as in   is the best fitting matrix of given rank @xmath39 to @xmath56 . by using this result we are able to show when the minimum of  , hence of @xmath63 can be reached .",
    "let us preliminary observe that the row vectors @xmath64 of @xmath65 can be chosen , without loss of generality , to satisfy the condition @xmath66 , which implies that the measures are uncorrelated ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath55 denotes the set of @xmath41 matrices , with @xmath11 , whose rows satisfy the aforementioned condition , i.e.  the set of matrices with orthonormal rows ( @xmath67 ) . by using",
    ", the minimum of   is obtained when ( cf .  @xcite ) @xmath68 since @xmath69 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the @xmath72__-th _ _ element of the canonical basis .",
    "hence , it is easy to verify that   holds for @xmath73 $ ] . as a consequence ,",
    "row vectors @xmath74 of @xmath2 are the first @xmath39 principal components of @xmath4 , i.e.  @xmath75 , for @xmath76 .    from these results ,",
    "a principal component can be defined as a linear combination of optimally - weighted observed variables meaning that the corresponding measures can account for a maximal amount of variance in the data set . as reported in  @xcite , every set of @xmath39 optimal measures can be considered as a representation of points in the best fitting lower dimensional subspace .",
    "thus the first measure gives the best one  dimensional representation of data set , the first two measures give the best two  dimensional representation , and so on .    in the noisy measurement case , can be rewritten as @xmath77 in this case , @xmath78 can not be attained for any finite @xmath2 : indeed , for unconstrained @xmath2 , @xmath79 would be attained for @xmath80 , i.e.  for infinite signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the problem can be recast in a well  posed form by imposing a constraint on the magnitude of the measurement matrix . up to a possible renormalization of @xmath3 ,",
    "we can search the optimum design in the set @xmath81 .",
    "this problem was discussed and solved in  @xcite , showing that , for arbitrary noise covariance matrix @xmath3 , @xmath82 which is attained for @xmath83 hence , if @xmath84 consists of all matrices with mutually perpendicular , unit length rows , the first @xmath39 principal components of @xmath4 are still the optimal choice for @xmath2 rows .",
    "the alternative case that the solution is sought under a frobenius norm constraint on @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath85 is discussed in  @xcite .      in this subsection",
    "we describe a different approach to the solution of problem  [ eq : optimalproblem ] , which consists of constructing a differential equation whose trajectories converge to the desired optimum .",
    "the method lends itself directly to efficient numerical implementations .",
    "although a closed - form solution has been proposed in the previous subsection , the numerical solution considered here is very useful when constraints are imposed on the measurement structure ( as they will be for instance in the hybrid sensor design ) , where closed form solutions are not applicable .",
    "the following proposition describes an algorithm that minimizes the cost function @xmath86 , providing the gradient flow which will be useful in the method of steepest descent .",

    "of course , in case of noise  free sensors , this constraint is not strictly necessary . on the other hand , in case of noisy sensors , the minimum of @xmath86 can not be obtained since it represents a limit case that can be achieved when @xmath2 becomes very large ( i.e.  an infimum ) and hence increasing the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ".    a reasonable solution for the constrained problem will be provided by using the rosen s gradient projection method for linear constraints  @xcite , which is based on projecting the search direction into the subspace tangent to the constraint .",
    "hence , given the steepest descent direction for the unconstrained problem , this method consists on finding the direction with the most negative directional derivative which satisfies the constraint on the structure of the matrix @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath91 .",
    "this can be obtained by using the projection matrix @xmath92 and then projecting the unconstrained gradient flow   into the subspace tangent to the constraint , obtaining the search direction @xmath93    having the search direction for the constrained problem , the gradient flow is given by @xmath94^t\\ ] ] where @xmath88 .",
    "the gradient flow   guarantees that the optimal solution @xmath40 will satisfy @xmath95 , if @xmath96 satisfies @xmath97 , i.e.  @xmath98 .",
    "notice that both @xmath55 and @xmath86 are not convex , hence the problem could not have a unique minimum .",
    "however , in case of noise  free measures , the invariance of the cost function w.r.t .  changes of basis ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath99 with @xmath100 a full rank matrix , suggests that there exists a subspace in @xmath48 where the optimum is achieved .",
    "indeed , gradients become zero when rows of matrix @xmath2 are any linear combination of a subset of @xmath39 principal components of the _ a priori _ covariance matrix . unfortunately",

    "when each measure @xmath101 , @xmath102 provided by the glove corresponds to a single joint angle @xmath15 , @xmath103 , the problem is to find the optimal choice of @xmath39 joints or dofs to be measured .",

    "finally , in figure  [ fig : poseest_withandwithoutnoise ] some reconstructed poses with mve algorithm are reported by using both @xmath146 and @xmath147 measurement matrix , with and without additional noise . under a qualitative point of view",
    ", what is noticeable is that reconstructed poses are not far from the real ones for both measurement matrices .",
    "moreover , it is not surprising that some poses seem to be estimated in a better manner using @xmath146 and vice versa , even if from the previously described statistical results @xmath147 provides best average performance . indeed , mve methods are thought to minimize error statistics rather than worst - case sensing errors related to peculiar poses  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , optimal design of sensing glove has been proposed on the basis of the minimization of the _ a posteriori _ covariance matrix as it results from the estimation procedure described in  @xcite . optimal solution are described for the continuous , discrete and hybrid case .    in the continuous sensing case",
    ", optimal measures are individuated by principal components of the _ a priori _ covariance matrix , thus suggesting the importance of postural synergies not only for hand control .",
    "the reconstruction performance obtained by combining the estimation technique proposed in  @xcite and the optimal design proposed in this paper is significantly improved if compared with non - optimal measure case .",
    "therefore ,  @xcite and  @xcite provide a complete procedure to enhance the performance and for a more effective development of both sensorization systems for robotic hands and active touch sensing systems , which can be used in a wide range of applications , ranging from virtual reality to tele - robotics and rehabilitation .",
    "moreover , by optimizing the number and location of sensors the production costs can be further reduced without loss of performance , thus increasing device diffusion .",
