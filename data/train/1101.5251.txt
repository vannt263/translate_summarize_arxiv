    "it is commonly known that stress - energy and spin tensors are not uniquely defined in field theory as long as gravity is disregarded . in quantum field theory ,",
    "distinct stress - energy tensors differing by the divergence of a rank 3 tensor provide , once integrated in three - dimensional space , the same generators of space - time translations provided that the flux of the additional rank 3 tensor field ( hereafter referred to as superpotential ) vanishes at the boundary .",
    "correspondingly , in classical field theory , the spatial integrals of @xmath2 yield the same values of total energy and momentum . within field theory on a flat spacetime , it is then possible to generate apparently equivalent stress - energy tensors which are e.g. symmetric or non - symmetric . indeed",
    ", gravitational coupling provides an unambiguous way of defining the stress - energy tensor ; in general relativity , it is symmetric by construction and the spin tensor vanishes .",
    "however , in a likely extension known as einstein - cartan theory ( not excluded by present observations ) the spin tensor is non - vanishing and the stress - energy tensor is non - symmetric .",
    "can we say something more ?",
    "in classical physics we have a stronger requirement with respect to a quantum theory : we would like the energy , momentum and angular momentum content of _ any _ arbitrary macroscopic spatial region to be well defined concepts ; otherwise stated , we would like to have objective values for the energy , momentum and angular momentum densities .",
    "if these quantities are to be the components of the stress - energy and spin tensors , such a requirement strongly limits the freedom to change these tensors .",
    "it is crucial to emphasize , from the very beginning , the difference between quantum and classical tensors .",
    "the quantum stress - energy and spin tensors , henceforth denoted with a hat @xmath3 , are operatorial expressions depending on the microscopic quantum field operators @xmath4 , whereas the classical ones are c - numbers .",
    "the relation between them is @xcite : @xmath5 \\qquad   \\spt^{\\lambda,\\mu",
    "\\nu}(x ) = { { \\rm tr } } [ \\widehat \\rho \\ , : \\!\\wspt^{\\lambda , \\mu \\nu}(x)\\!:]\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the density operator describing the ( mixed or pure ) quantum state and @xmath7 denotes normal ordering ; the latter is usually introduced in the mean value definition in order to subtract the zero - point infinities .",

    "( [ mean ] ) . ] according to ( [ mean ] ) , a change of quantum stress - energy and spin tensors could induce a change of the corresponding classical ones in an undesirable fashion , meaning that energy or momentum or angular momentum density get changed .",
    "however , the change that classical mean values undergo as a reflection of a variation of quantum tensors crucially depends on the physical state @xmath8 .",
    "particularly , we will see that the freedom of varying the stress - energy and spin tensors at a quantum level depends on the symmetry features of the physical state : a highly symmetric state allows more changes of quantum tensors than a state with little symmetry does .    in this paper",
    ", we prove that a system at full thermodynamical equilibrium with a macroscopic value of angular momentum , thence rigidly rotating @xcite , allows to discriminate between different quantum spin tensors , and , consequently , between different quantum stress - energy tensors . this kind of inequivalence shows up only for a rotating system whereas all quantum tensors are equivalent for a system at the more familiar thermodynamical equilibrium with vanishing macroscopic angular momentum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ transform ] we will discuss the general class of stress - energy tensor transformations ensuring the invariance of conservation equations ; in sect .",
    "[ thermo ] we will discuss the usual thermodynamical equilibrium distribution and its symmetries and in sect .",

[ axisymm ] we will obtain the most general form of mean stress - energy and spin tensor for a system at full thermodynamical equilibrium with angular momentum and show that the equivalence between different quantum tensors no longer applies unless peculiar conditions are met ; in sect .  [ dirac ] we will present and prove a concrete instance of inequivalence for the free dirac field ; finally , in sect .",
    "[ concl ] we will summarize and further illustrate the obtained result and discuss the possible consequences thereof .      in this paper we adopt the natural units , with @xmath9 . + the minkowskian metric tensor is @xmath10 ; for the levi - civita symbol we use the convention @xmath11 .",
    "+ we will use the relativistic notation with repeated greek indices assumed to be saturated .",
    "operators in hilbert space will be denoted by an upper hat , e.g. @xmath12 , with the exception of the dirac field operator which is denoted with a capital @xmath4 .",
    "the conservation equations ensuing from the relativistic translational and lorentz invariance are the well known continuity equations of energy - momentum and total angular momentum : @xmath13 however , stress - energy @xmath14 and spin tensor @xmath15 are not uniquely defined in quantum field theory ; once a particular couple @xmath16 of these tensors is found , e.g. applying noether s theorem to some lagrangian density ( the so - called _ canonical _ tensors ) , it is possible to generate new couples @xmath17 through the following pseudo - gauge transformation @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an arbitrary tensor of rank three antisymmetric in the last two indices depending on the fields @xmath20 .",

    "[ dirac ] ) .",
    "it is very important to stress here that one can obtain conserved stress - energy and angular momentum tensors and a corresponding set of conserved generators even within a finite or bounded region , thus breaking global translational and rotational symmetry , provided that suitable boundary conditions are imposed on the fields ; this point will be further discussed in sect .",
    "[ dirac ] .",

    "a pseudo - gauge transformation like ( [ transfq ] ) is always possible provided that the boundary conditions ( [ boundary ] ) are ensured ; in this case the couple @xmath16 and @xmath17 are regarded as equivalent in quantum field theory because they give the same total energy , momentum and angular momentum , in the operatorial sense .",
    "the classical counterpart of transformation ( [ transfq ] ) can be calculated by applying eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) to both sides and this obviously leads to : @xmath27 if the system is macroscopic , we would like the mean values of those tensors to be invariant under a transformation ( [ transf ] ) , and not just their integrals .",
    "this is because energy , momentum and total angular momentum densities classically must take on objective values , independent of the particular quantum tensors .",
    "a minimal requirement would be the invariance of the aforementioned densities , that is : @xmath28 however , this is a frame - dependent requirement ; a lorenzt - boosted frame would measure a different energy - momentum density if only the first row of the stress - energy tensor was invariant under transformation ( [ transf ] ) in one particular frame .",

    "yet , we can argue , on the basis of a thermodynamical argument - which can in principle be used to assess any other couple of tensors - that the canonical spin tensor is favoured over the belinfante one ; the argument also elucidates why the source of the inequivalence is ultimately the second law of thermodynamics .",
