    "we are interested in this note in the construction of some special hypercyclic  operators  on hilbert spaces .",
    "our work fits into the framework of linear dynamics , which is the study of the properties of the iterates @xmath1 , @xmath2 , of a bounded linear operator  @xmath3 acting on an infinite dimensional ,  banach space @xmath4 .",
    "it is of particular interest to study the behavior of the orbits @xmath5 of vectors @xmath6 of @xmath4 under the action of @xmath3 .",
    "for instance when @xmath7 is dense in @xmath4 , the vector @xmath6 is said to be _",
    "the operator  @xmath3 itself is hypercyclic  when there exists an @xmath8 such that @xmath6 is hypercyclic  for @xmath3 .",
    "it is not completely trivial to exhibit hypercyclic  operators : the first example of such an operator  was given by rolewicz @xcite , who proved that if @xmath9 denotes the standard backward weighted shift on @xmath10 , @xmath11 is hypercyclic  for any complex number @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "many more examples of hypercyclic  operators  on `` classical '' spaces can be found in the book @xcite .",
    "it is a non - trivial result of ansari @xcite and bernal - gonzalez @xcite , relying on previous work of salas @xcite that any ( real or complex ) ,  infinite - dimensional banach space @xmath4 supports a hypercyclic  operator .",
    "such a general operator  has necessarily the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a nuclear operator  on @xmath4 , so that a nuclear perturbation of the identity operator  can indeed be hypercyclic .",
    "obviously a finite rank perturbation of the identity operator  can never be hypercyclic .    in @xcite shkarin",
    "investigated the following question : can a finite rank perturbation of a unitary operator  on a complex ,  infinite - dimensional hilbert space be hypercyclic ?",
    "this question came from the work of salas @xcite on supercyclicity of weighted shifts : @xmath3 is said to be _ supercyclic _ ( a weaker requirement than hypercyclicity ) if there exists a vector @xmath8 such that @xmath16 is dense in @xmath4 .",
    "it is known ( @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) that no hyponormal operator  on a hilbert space can be supercyclic .",
    "salas thus proposed the following question : can a finite rank perturbation of a hyponormal operator  on a hilbert space be supercyclic ?",
    "shkarin answered in @xcite this question in the affirmative , and proved : there exists a unitary operator  @xmath17 and an operator  @xmath18 of rank at most @xmath19 acting on a hilbert space @xmath20 such that @xmath21 is hypercyclic  on @xmath20 .",
    "this yields an example of a contraction @xmath22 and a rank @xmath0 operator  @xmath23 on @xmath20 such that @xmath24 is hypercyclic . but",
    "a natural question remained open in @xcite :    [ q1 ] does there exist a rank @xmath0 perturbation of a unitary operator  on a hilbert space which is hypercyclic ?",
    "our aim in this paper is to answer question [ q1 ] in the affirmative :    [ th1 ] there exists a unitary operator  @xmath25 and a rank @xmath0 operator  @xmath18 on the complex hilbert space @xmath10 such that the operator  @xmath26 is hypercyclic  on @xmath10 .",
    "our method of proof is rather different from the one employed in @xcite , the only common point being the criterion for hypercyclicity which we use : it is based on the properties of eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues of @xmath3 which are of modulus @xmath0 , and was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use here a recent refinement of this criterion which comes from @xcite , see section 2 of this paper .",
    "the operators  which we construct are intrinsically different from the ones of @xcite : in @xcite the operators  live on the function space @xmath27 , and the operator  @xmath21 ( @xmath17 unitary , @xmath18 of rank @xmath19 ) which is constructed is an operator  induced by @xmath28 on an invariant subspace of @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the multiplication operator  by @xmath30 on @xmath27 and @xmath31 is a rank one operator  on @xmath27 .",
    "one of the key tools in the proof of @xcite is a result of belov @xcite concerning the distribution of values of certain functions @xmath32 defined as lacunary trigonometric series .",
    "our approach here is much more elementary : our unitary operator  @xmath25 is a diagonal operator  on @xmath10 with unimodular diagonal coefficients , and these coefficients as well as the two vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath10 which define @xmath35 are constructed by induction in such a way that the eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues of modulus @xmath0 of the operator  @xmath36 can be explicitly written down .",
    "the main idea of the proof of theorem [ th1 ] is presented in section 2 , and the inductive construction , which is more technical , is given in section 3 .",
    "the criterion for hypercyclicity which we are going to use in the proof of theorem [ th1 ] is stated in terms of eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues of modulus @xmath0 of the operator . roughly speaking ,",
    "if @xmath3 is a bounded linear operator  on a complex ,  banach space @xmath4 which has `` plenty '' of such eigenvectors , then @xmath3 is hypercyclic . here is the precise definition :    we say that @xmath37 has a _ ps .",
    "_  if there exists a continuous probability measure  @xmath38 on the unit circle @xmath39 such that for any @xmath38-measurable subset @xmath9 of @xmath39 with @xmath40 , we have @xmath41=x$ ] .    when @xmath3 has a ps .",
    ", it is automatically hypercyclic .",
    "this is proved in @xcite .",
    "the easiest way to check this spanning property of the eigenvectors is to exhibit a family @xmath42 of compact perfect subsets of @xmath39 and a family @xmath43 of eigenvector  fields @xmath44 which are continuous on @xmath45 and such that the vectors @xmath46 , @xmath47 , span a dense subspace of @xmath4 .",
    "this can be done rather easily by using the following theorem , which was proved in @xcite :    [ th0 ] let @xmath4 be a complex ,  infinite - dimensional banach space , and let @xmath3 be a bounded operator  on @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that there exists a sequence @xmath48 of vectors of @xmath4 having the following properties :    * for each @xmath49 , @xmath50 is an eigenvector  of @xmath3 associated to an eigenvalue  @xmath51 of @xmath3 , with @xmath52 and the @xmath53 s all distinct ; * @xmath54 $ ] is dense in @xmath4 ; * for any @xmath49 and any @xmath55 , there exists an @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "then there exists a family @xmath42 of subsets of @xmath39 which are homeomorphic to the cantor set @xmath58 and a family @xmath43 of eigenvector  fields @xmath44 which are continuous on @xmath45 for each @xmath59 and which span @xmath4 : @xmath60 $ ] is dense in @xmath4 .",
    "so @xmath3 has a ps . , and in particular @xmath3 is hypercyclic .",
    "theorem [ th0 ] actually yields a stronger conclusion , as it is known that if @xmath3 has a ps .",
    ", then it is frequently hypercyclic .",
    "see @xcite for the definition of frequent hypercyclicity and for a proof of this statement in the hilbert space setting , and @xcite for a proof in the banach space case . when the eigenvalues @xmath51 which appear in the assumption of theorem [ th0 ] are @xmath61 roots of @xmath0 , @xmath62 , then the operator  is not only hypercyclic  but chaotic ( it is hypercyclic  and has a dense set of periodic vectors ) .",
    "we will in the proof of theorem [ th1 ] construct the operator  @xmath3 so that the assumptions of theorem [ th0 ] are satisfied .",
    "it will become clear in the course of the proof that we can choose the @xmath53 s to be @xmath61 roots of @xmath0 , and thus the operator  of theorem [ th1 ] can be made chaotic and frequently hypercyclic .",
    "we are looking for a hypercyclic  operator  @xmath3 on the space @xmath10 endowed with the canonical basis @xmath63 of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is a unitary operator  and @xmath18 is an operator  of rank @xmath0 . the unitary operator  which we construct is a diagonal operator  @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is for each @xmath66 a complex number of modulus @xmath0 with the @xmath67 s all distinct .",
    "the operator  @xmath18 has the form @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are two elements of @xmath10 : @xmath71 for any @xmath72 .",
    "our aim is to define the coefficients @xmath67 and the numbers @xmath73 and @xmath74 in such a way that the operator  @xmath75 satisfies the assumptions of theorem [ th0 ] .",
    "let @xmath76 be a complex number of modulus @xmath0 .",
    "then with the notation above , @xmath12 is an eigenvalue  of the operator  @xmath75 with associated eigenvector  @xmath77 if and only if  @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath80 . if @xmath81 , @xmath82 is injective , and thus the equation above admits a non - zero solution @xmath83 if and only if @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is unique and @xmath87 . if @xmath88 , then necessarily @xmath89 and @xmath87 means that @xmath90 we can reformulate this observation as :    [ lem1 ] if @xmath91 , then @xmath92 is an eigenvalue  of @xmath93 if and only if   @xmath94 in this case an associated eigenvector  @xmath83 is given by @xmath95      let @xmath96 be a function having the following properties :    @xmath97 @xmath98 ;    @xmath97 @xmath99 for every @xmath100 ;    @xmath97 for any @xmath101 the set @xmath102 is infinite , i.e. @xmath103 takes every value @xmath101 infinitely often .    the proof of theorem [ th1 ] will be carried out via an induction argument . as step @xmath104 , @xmath66 ,",
    "we define two unimodular numbers @xmath67 and @xmath105 , a complex number @xmath73 and an @xmath104-tuple @xmath106 of complex numbers such that the following properties hold true :    * if @xmath107 denotes the diagonal operator  on @xmath108 with diagonal coefficients @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , and @xmath111 denotes the rank @xmath0 operator  @xmath112 on @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath113 for any @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 , then the operator  @xmath117 acting on @xmath108 has @xmath104 distinct eigenvalues which are the unimodular numbers @xmath118 .",
    "moreover @xmath105 does not belong to the set of distinct numbers @xmath119 , and the vector @xmath120 is an eigenvector  of @xmath121 associated to the eigenvalue  @xmath51 .",
    "additionally for any @xmath66 , @xmath122=\\textrm{sp}[e_{1},\\ldots , e_{n}]$ ] . thus there exists a positive constant @xmath123 such that for any @xmath114 with @xmath124 , we have @xmath125 * @xmath126 and @xmath127 * @xmath128 * @xmath129 * we have @xmath130 * for any @xmath131 , @xmath132 * @xmath133 * for any @xmath134 and any @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "suppose that the construction of the sequences @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 has been carried out in such a way that properties ( 1)-(8 ) are satisfied . by ( 2 )",
    "the vector @xmath69 belongs to @xmath10 . by ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , we have    * @xmath141    so that the sequence @xmath140 converges in @xmath10 to a certain vector @xmath70 , with    * @xmath142 .",
    "so it makes sense to define the rank one operator  @xmath35 on @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the diagonal operator  @xmath143 on @xmath10 .",
    "we are going to show , using theorem [ th0 ] , that @xmath93 is then hypercyclic , which will prove theorem [ th1 ] .",

    "for any @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 since @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 is finite , @xmath152 tends to zero as @xmath104 tends to infinity . applying this to @xmath153 yields that for any @xmath101 and any @xmath135 , @xmath154 by ( 8) , as @xmath155 for any @xmath156 . by ( 6 )",
    "the sequence @xmath157 converges as @xmath104 tends to infinity to a certain vector @xmath158 , which is nothing but @xmath159 it is a non zero vector , and making @xmath160 tend to infinity in the inequalities above shows that @xmath161 , so that @xmath50 is an eigenvector  of @xmath3 associated to the eigenvalue  @xmath51 .",
    "let us now prove that the sequence @xmath48 satisfies the assumptions of theorem [ th0 ] : assertion @xmath162 is true by construction , as the @xmath51 s are all distinct .",
    "as for assertion @xmath163 , let us consider a vector @xmath164 with finite support and @xmath165 .",
    "writing @xmath6 as @xmath166 , we have by ( 1 ) @xmath167 by ( 6 ) .",
    "hence for any @xmath55 there exists a vector @xmath168 $ ] such that @xmath169 , and this proves assertion @xmath170 .",
    "assertion @xmath171 is a consequence of ( 7 ) : for any @xmath101 let @xmath172 be the set @xmath173 .",
    "observe that if @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "for any @xmath176 we have @xmath177 by ( 7 ) .",
    "let us estimate @xmath178 : @xmath179 thus if @xmath180 is any positive number , since @xmath172 is infinite there exists an @xmath176 such that @xmath181 , and assertion @xmath171 of theorem [ th0 ] is satisfied too .",
    "we have thus proved that @xmath3 is hypercyclic , which proves theorem [ th1 ] modulo the construction of @xmath67 , @xmath105 , @xmath73 and @xmath182 for each @xmath66 .",
    "in order to complete the proof of theorem [ th1 ] , we now have to carry out the induction step . before starting ,",
    "let us reformulate the first half of condition ( 1 ) in a more convenient way : saying that the operator  @xmath183 acting on @xmath108 has @xmath104 distinct eigenvalues @xmath118 exactly means that we have @xmath184    let @xmath185 be the matrix @xmath186 with @xmath187 .",
    "these coefficients are well - defined , as we choose at each step @xmath160 @xmath188 and @xmath189",
    ". then equations ( [ eq1 ] ) can be rewritten as the matrix equation @xmath190      @xmath97 we start by taking @xmath191 and @xmath192 for instance",
    ". then we take @xmath193 with @xmath194 and @xmath195 so small ( with @xmath196 in particular ) that if we set @xmath197 then @xmath198 .",
    "of course @xmath199 .",
    "@xmath97 suppose now that the construction has been carried out until step @xmath200 .",
    "we have to construct @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 and @xmath204 such that properties ( 1)-(8 ) hold true .",
    "first of all , let @xmath55 be a positive number which is so small that :      we first construct the @xmath206 diagonal coefficient @xmath67 of @xmath107 : it is chosen very close to @xmath207 . more precisely : by the induction assumption @xmath207 is an eigenvalue  of the matrix @xmath208 , so that @xmath209 it follows that there exists @xmath210 such that for any @xmath211 with @xmath212 , we have @xmath213 we choose @xmath214 such that @xmath215 .",
    "we then have : @xmath216 once @xmath67 is chosen , the next step is to choose @xmath105 .",
    "we take @xmath217 with @xmath218 so small that @xmath219 and @xmath220    it is easy to see that conditions ( g ) , ( h ) , ( i ) and ( j ) can be fullfilled if @xmath218 is small enough .",
    "that condition ( k ) can be made to hold too is not so immediate , but not too hard either : first of all for any @xmath221 there exists a @xmath222 such that if @xmath223 , then @xmath224 indeed @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is the matrix obtained from @xmath227 by multiplying its last line by @xmath228 .",
    "if @xmath218 is extremely small , the coefficients @xmath229 , @xmath230 , are almost equal to zero , while @xmath231 .",
    "thus @xmath232 can be made as close as we wish to @xmath233 , and it is possible to ensure that @xmath234 from which it follows that @xmath224 notice that @xmath235       the coefficients @xmath237 and @xmath238 of @xmath239 , @xmath240 , can be made arbitrarily small if @xmath218 is small enough , as @xmath241 and @xmath242 do not depend on @xmath243 , while @xmath244 can be made arbitrarily small with @xmath218 ;     the coefficients @xmath245 , @xmath246 can be made very close to the coefficients @xmath247 . indeed the dominant term in the computation of @xmath248 is the one involving @xmath249 , that is @xmath250 .",
    "so @xmath251 can be made as close as we wish to @xmath252    hence @xmath239 is very close to the matrix @xmath253 for the operator  norm on @xmath254 , where @xmath255 for @xmath246 and @xmath256 for @xmath240 .",
    "hence there exists @xmath257 such that @xmath258 if @xmath259 , and property ( k ) is satisfied if @xmath105 is sufficiently close to @xmath67 .    now that @xmath67 and @xmath105 are constructed , it remains to fix @xmath73 and @xmath182 .",
    "we take first @xmath260 there is now not much room for the choice of @xmath182 : we must have @xmath261 the numbers @xmath262 are completely determined by these equations , and so we set @xmath263            @xmath97 let us now check property ( 5 ) .",
    "we have @xmath266 hence @xmath267 by ( g ) we have @xmath268 , so that @xmath269 hence @xmath270 by ( k ) and the fact that @xmath271 , that is @xmath272 in particular @xmath273 so that @xmath274 by ( c ) we get that @xmath275 which is property ( 5 ) .",
