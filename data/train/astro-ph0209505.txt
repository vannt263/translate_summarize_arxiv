    "dark energy ( de ) parameters or the amplitude of primeval gravitational waves ( gw ) are just mildly constrained by anisotropy data , while polarization would significantly depend on them .",
    "a peculiar situation then holds for the cosmic optical depth to cmb photons ( @xmath1 ) , due to reionization .",
    "anisotropy data only mildly constrain it , while polarization data would provide more stringent constraints ; of course , greater @xmath1 values would ease its detection , but , in turn , greater @xmath1 values would also ease the determination of de and/or gw parameters .",
    "this paper tries to investigate which polarization experiment(s ) can determine @xmath1 .",
    "the success of an experiment , however , will also depend on the value of @xmath1 itself .",
    "in particular , we shall consider the sport experiment ( macculi et al .",
    "2000 ; carretti et al . 2000 ; peverini et al . 2001 ) , planned to perform a ( nearly ) full  sky polarization measure aboard of the iss in 2004 , with an angular resolution similar to cobe .",
    "when only anisotropy data are considered , there is a degeneracy between the effects of varying @xmath1 or the primeval spectral index @xmath0 ( jungman et al . 1996 ; zaldarriaga , spergel & seljak 1997 ; eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1999 ; efstathiou & bond 1999 ) .",
    "the most stringent limits on @xmath1 , based on anisotropy data , are provided by stompor et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who used the outputs of recent balloon experiments to set @xmath5 at the 2@xmath4 level , once @xmath0 is assumed @xmath6 .",
    "( such limits will be included in a number of figures here below and denominated _ stompor limits _ ) . full ",
    "sky anisotropy measures from space , like map or planck , might improve the _ stompor limits _ by a factor @xmath7 . in turn , a residual uncertainty ( @xmath8 ) on the value of @xmath0 is related to our scarce knowledge of @xmath1 .",
    "of course , a more precise determination of @xmath0 would really be welcome , first of all to shed new light on the mechanism generating primeval fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , within a generic inflationary model , only for @xmath9 primeval gw may be expected to exist .",
    "the impact that a variation of @xmath1 may have on cmb polarization can be seen from fig .  1 ; here , for a spatially flat cosmological model ( density parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc : @xmath12 ; @xmath13 ; dark energy is an ordinary cosmological constant ) and for different values of @xmath1 , we plot the dependence on @xmath2 of the angular spectra @xmath14 with @xmath15 , standing for anisotropy , @xmath16 and @xmath17mode polarization and anisotropy  polarization cross correlation respectively ; only @xmath16mode polarization is considered through this paper .",
    "1 shows that the main dependence on @xmath1 actually occurs at low @xmath2 and for the polarization and cross  correlation spectra ; comparatively , the @xmath1 dependence of spectra , at @xmath18 , is milder .",
    "this point is important to devise the right polarization experiment , which should aim to great sensitivity , while , for @xmath1 determination , high resolution data might not bear a direct relevance .",
    "accordingly , the angular resolution of the sport experiment does not prevent it from achieving cosmologically significant results .    here , as well as in most recent literature",
    ", we assume that the whole cosmic opacity arises from an almost complete ionization of hydrogen , after a suitable redshift .",
    "more complex reionization histories may have to be taken into account to discuss future data ( bruscoli , ferrara & scannapieco 2002 ; venkatesan 2002 ) , but would not modify general conclusions .    for low@xmath2 spectral components , varying @xmath0 has a milder effect than varying @xmath1 . if the whole angular spectrum is considered , other parameters , like @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( total , matter and baryon density parameters ) , may be determined independently from low@xmath2 features .",
    "here we shall assume that they are already known from such high@xmath2 anisotropy measures .",
    "dealing with low @xmath2 s , a significant part of our analysis will be devoted to inspect cosmic variance .",
    "its impact on @xmath22 determination is known . here , however , we are interested in measuring different quantities and a knowledge of @xmath22 s is not even required",
    ". we shall explore this point by simulating and analyzing a large number of artificial data sets . among other things",
    ", we shall see that the sport experiment , although far from granting a stringent @xmath1 determination , may improve the _",
    "stompor limit _ in a significant number of cases .    in the next section we shall first debate which range of values can be expected for @xmath1 .",
    "we shall then describe how artificial data sets are produced . in section 4",
    "we shall show the results of their analysis , in a number of different experimental conditions and considering different @xmath1 values . in section 5 , conclusions will be drawn .",
    "in the present cosmic epoch , although diffuse baryonic materials are almost completely ionized , the scattering time for cmb photons @xmath23s ( @xmath24 : hubble parameter in units of 100  km / s / mpc ) exceeds the hubble time @xmath25s and the universe is transparent to cmb photons .",
    "these figures can be extrapolated to the past , but , while @xmath26 ( @xmath27 : the scale factor ) , the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath27 depends on the cosmological model . in an expansion regime dominated by",
    "non  relativistic matter , a fully ionized universe is opaque to cmb at @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath30 ( standard bbns limits ; see , e.g. , dolgov 2002 for a recent review ) and @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 , safely above the expected reionization redshift @xmath33 .",
    "no reasonable cosmological model allows a substantial reduction of such @xmath34 .    on the contrary ,",
    "the precise value of @xmath35 , does depend on the model and , in particular , on @xmath33 .",
    "recent data on high@xmath36 qso s ( djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 ; becker et al .",
    "2001 ) indicate that at least a fraction of neutral hydrogen is present , in the intergalactic medium , at @xmath37 .",
    "these very authors , however , warn us against an immediate conclusion that @xmath38 .",
    "reionization can be a slow and/or patchy process and our present knowledge of primeval object formation can be consistent with an effective @xmath38 or a significantly greater value . in fig .",
    "2 we show how @xmath1 is related to @xmath33 and model features , considering a wide set of cosmological models . for @xmath39 , values of @xmath1 up to @xmath400.20",
    "are licit .",
    "artificial data sets will be built with reference to the features of the sky polarization observatory ( sport ) experiment , selected by the european space agency ( esa ) to fly on the international space station ( iss ) in 2004 , aiming to measure the linear polarization of the diffuse sky radiation at 22 , 32 and 90 ghz , using a set of polarimeters fed by corrugated horns with an angular resolution ( fwhm ) of @xmath41 . at variance from other space experiments ( map and planck )",
    ", sport has been explicitly designed to measure the stokes parameters q and u and to minimize systematics and instrumental polarization .",
    "sport will observe a sky area with declination @xmath42 ( @xmath43 of the whole sky ) .",
    "the lifetime of the experiment is at least 1.5 years , but an extension is not unlikely ; data will be binned in a number of pixels ranging from 662 to several thousands , depending on the effective duration of the flight and efficiency .    in this analysis",
    "we shall assume that pixels are distributed according to the healpix package , with @xmath44 or 16 , and smoothed with a gaussian beam of fwhm of @xmath41 .",
    "the two choices of @xmath45 allow to confirm that the best exploitation of the observational output is achieved when the average angular distance between pixel centers is @xmath46 half fwhm .",
    "for the low ( high ) resolution cases we shall therefore have , on the whole sky , 768 ( 3072 ) pixels , whose centers lie at an average angular distance of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "once polar caps are excluded , there remain 600 ( 2448 ) pixels , providing measures of the stokes parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "sport polarimeters will provide no anisotropy data .",
    "such information will be however available through other experiments ( cobe , map ) and we shall assume here that no peculiar problem arises in correlating sport and anisotropy data .",
    "of course , anisotropy data probe a different sky area , i.e. the whole sky , excluding the area with declination @xmath51 , where galactic contamination is severe .",
    "( on the contrary , such contamination can be assumed to be under control , for polarization data ; see , e.g. , bruscoli et al .",
    "2002 ; tucci et al . 2002 . ) for the coarse ( fine ) pixelization cases , as above , in this sky area there are 480 ( 1984 ) pixels . for 376 ( 1360 ) of them , both anisotropy and polarization data are supposed to be available .",
    "random noise ( @xmath3 ) will be included in artificial data , assuming it to be uncorrelated , both among pixels and between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in the case of polarization measures .",
    "we shall assume @xmath52k ( @xmath53k ) for temperature data ( as expected for map measurements scaled to the sport resolution ) .",
    "on the contrary , one of the main variables we consider is the noise level for polarization data .",
    "sport data will be characterized by @xmath54k per pixel , where @xmath55 is the experiment s lifetime in years while @xmath56 indicates the detection efficiency .",
    "our analysis will consider @xmath3 s in the interval comprised from 0.5 to 5@xmath57k per pixel , with coarse pixelization , corresponding to 1 to 10@xmath57k per pixel , with fine pixelization .",
    "the expected angular spectra @xmath58 , were produced with the program cmbfast , starting from a spatially flat cosmological model with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "dark energy is an ordinary cosmological constant .",
    "several values of @xmath0 were considered , but we shall report results only for @xmath13 .",
    "other close @xmath0 values yield quantitatively similar results and the potentiality of the experiment does not depend on @xmath0 , in any appreciable way . on the contrary ,",
    "our analysis aimed to exploring @xmath1 values ranging from 0.035 to 0.25 .",
    "cosmic variance was taken into account by considering 1000 independent realizations for each @xmath1 and @xmath3 pair .",
    "the first aim of our analysis amounts to finding the likelihood distribution on the plane @xmath1@xmath0 .",
    "the number of pixels for anisotropy and polarization ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) in our ( artificial ) data are different .",
    "let then @xmath61 be the anisotropy measured in @xmath59 pixels and @xmath62 and @xmath63 the stokes parameters measured in @xmath60 pixels . in general ,",
    "let us define vectors @xmath64 , of @xmath65 components , defining an observed state of anisotropy and polarization .",
    "once a pair of values @xmath1@xmath0 is assigned , the angular spectra @xmath66 are univocally determined . on the contrary ,",
    "a data vector @xmath67 , of @xmath68 components , built from them , is just a _ realization _ of such model : once the @xmath68 component vector @xmath67 is assigned , the pair of values @xmath1@xmath0 is not univocally fixed .    a function @xmath69^{-{1 \\over 2 } } \\exp   \\big [ -{1 \\over 2}{\\bf d^t } { \\bf m}^{-1 } { \\bf d } \\big ] \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] shall then be built , to yield the likelihood of a given set of @xmath70 ( i.e. , of a pair of @xmath1@xmath0 values ) , if @xmath67 is observed .",
    "the main ingredient of @xmath71 is the correlation matrix @xmath72 ; here @xmath73 is the signal term and @xmath74 is due to the noise .",
    "the components @xmath75 yield the correlation between the @xmath76th and @xmath77th elements of data vectors @xmath78 corresponding to particular choices of @xmath79 , i.e. of @xmath1@xmath0 values .",
    "the construction of the ( model dependent ) signal term , however , does not require to build explicitly the vectors @xmath78 .",
    "the procedure to be followed , in the case when both anisotropy and polarization data are available , is explicitly reported by zaldarriaga ( 1998 ) .",
    "the construction of the noise term is simpler , as we expect no noise correlation , and the matrix @xmath80 ( for @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 ( for @xmath83 ) is diagonal .    in",
    "what follows , the technical role of the @xmath84 spectra will not need to be further outlined and the likelihood function will be explicitly considered to depend on @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in particular , we assume that the most probable @xmath1@xmath0 pair , for a given anisotropy ",
    "polarization state @xmath67 , is the one which maximizes the likelihood . on the @xmath1@xmath0 plane",
    ", we can then define curves connecting points where @xmath71 corresponds to a given fraction of its top value .",
    "the area enclosed by each such curve corresponds to a given confidence level . in the figures below ,",
    "such fractions were selected in order that the areas enclosed by the curves correspond to 68@xmath85 , 90@xmath85 and 99@xmath85 confidence levels .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we shall refer to them as 123@xmath86 levels .",
    "because of the role played by low@xmath2 harmonics in our analysis , as above outlined , cosmic variance may be quite significant .",
    "henceforth , 1000 realizations of each model will be considered ; 123@xmath86 curves will be obtained by averaging among the results of such realizations , so obtaining an _ average likelihood distribution_. of course , this is not sufficient to evaluate the expected result of a given experiment .",
    "we shall therefore implement average results with histograms , describing the distribution of results in various realizations , suitably defined for the various cases .",
    "because of the large number of realizations required , we considered likelihood distributions both for coarse and fine pixelization , corresponding to distances between pixel centers of @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "a comparison of such distributions , for the cases we treated in both ways , confirms that , in general , a finer pixelization allows a better exploitation of data .",
    "finding some general trends , however , does not require fine pixelization analysis .    in fig .  3",
    ", we report the likelihood distributions for @xmath87 and 4 levels of @xmath3 ( for coarse pixelization ) . in fig .  4 , we report the likelihood distribution for the same @xmath1 value and @xmath88k ( for fine pixelization , corresponding to @xmath89k with coarse pixelization ) . besides of the solid curves obtained by considering both anisotropy and polarization , dashed curves",
    "are shown , obtained from polarization data only .",
    "stompor limits are explicitly shown in fig .  4 , while in fig .  3 we report stompor s 95@xmath85 confidence limit only .",
    "see the caption of fig .  4 for further details on stompor limits .    from these figures",
    "it is clearly visible that upper limits on @xmath1 can be significantly improved , in respect to previous analyses , for @xmath903@xmath57k .",
    "this is true even if only polarization data are used .",
    "the main improvement obtained , when using anisotropy data as well , concerns @xmath0 , for which both lower and upper limits are obtained . when passing from coarse to fine pixelization , @xmath0 is even better constrained . if @xmath3 is at the lowest levels considered , @xmath0 determination is better than in stompor s case .    for what concerns lower limits on @xmath1 ,",
    "the situation is more critical . detecting a lower limit",
    ", however , should be the main aim of such kind of experiments .",
    "4 shows that a lower limit , in average , can be detected at the 1@xmath4 confidence level at most .",
    "this is a case , however , when average estimates themselves are insufficient . in fig .  5 , therefore",
    ", we show the distribution of 1@xmath4 lower limits found , with or without taking into account anisotropy , with fine pixelization . in the former case",
    ", we see that , in @xmath91 of cases a lower limit is found . such percentage decreases to @xmath92 , if no anisotropy data could be considered . for",
    "the sake of comparison , let us report that the above figures decrease to @xmath93 and @xmath94 , with coarse pixelization .",
    "going below a noise level of @xmath95k per pixel ( with fine pixelization ) , although highly problematic from an experimental point of view , would be however decisive .",
    "this is shown by fig .  6 ,",
    "where we see that , for @xmath96k , even the average 3@xmath4 curve indicates a detection of @xmath97 . if the distribution of lower limits in various realizations is considered , we find that , only in @xmath98 of cases , no 3@xmath4 lower limits would be detectable .",
    "let us now consider the cases with greater @xmath1 values .",
    "they are reported in fig .  7 and 8 , for @xmath99 and 0.15 .",
    "these figures are all obtained with coarse pixelization .",
    "they confirm that significant improvements of stompor upper limits on @xmath1 are obtainable for @xmath1003@xmath57k .",
    "moreover , lower limits become safer than in the @xmath101 case .",
    "even with @xmath88k , if @xmath102 , a 1@xmath4 lower limit is likely to be obtained and a 2@xmath4 lower limit might be obtained as well .",
    "this is an important point , as such noise levels are not far from those obtainable , in the best possible conditions , by the sport experiment .",
    "it is also significant to go above average values , for lower limits , in all previous cases . in fig .  9 to 11",
    ", we report the fractions of realizations , for which lower limits were detected , both using anisotropy  polarization data and polarization only . among various possible comments ,",
    "these plots confirm that , in order to detect @xmath1 ( unless @xmath103 ) , the noise level of the sport experiment is too high .",
    "it may also be significant to compare these figures with the expected noise level in the planck measurements of polarization .",
    "weighting the various channels in order to minimize variance , it is expected that @xmath104k , for a fwhm of @xmath105 ( see , e.g. , hu & okamoto 2002 ) .",
    "if a scaling @xmath106 is assumed , this yields @xmath107k , if reported to our fine pixelization . at such noise level , no magnification of the intrinsic cosmic variance seems to occur .",
    "in this paper we performed a likelihood analysis , to determine how a polarization experiment could break the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 determinations , found in pure anisotropy analyses .",
    "to this aim we built artificial data , consistent with an experiment in progress to detect polarization , but pushing noise even well below the expected experimental level . the experiment considered will cover 80@xmath85 of the whole sky and artificial data were built assuming such sky coverage . if data were available for the full sky , a slight improvement of the signal can be expected .",
    "artificial data were then analyzed . in respect to future observers , we have however the critical advantage to be able to analyze as many skies ( realizations ) we need .",
    "this is significant , in our case , as the @xmath0@xmath1 degeneracy , in principle , is readily overcome from low@xmath2 spectral components , where , however , cosmic variance can be critical . our results",
    ", however , indicate that cosmic variance is not such a severe limitation , if a sufficiently low noise level is attained .",
    "this is one of the most important conclusions of our analysis , as it confirms that , to detect @xmath1 , polarization experiments should aim to high sensitivity , while high resolution does not bear a direct relevance .",
    "the critical issue , in this respect , is whether and when firm lower limits on @xmath1 are obtainable .",
    "the noise level to be attained , to implement such aim , obviously depends on the physical value of @xmath1 itself .",
    "available constraints on @xmath1 , besides that from cmb anisotropy data , can be also related to the detection of hydrogen lines in high@xmath36 qso spectra .",
    "this however leaves us a still significant range of possible cosmic opacities to cmb photons .",
    "if @xmath1 is not negligibly low , the noise level below which we expect that lower limits on @xmath1 can be obtained is @xmath1082@xmath57k , for an instrument with an angular resolution similar to cobe . a detection , at higher @xmath109 , can not be however excluded .",
    "we compared such general conclusion with the actual expected features of the sport experiment and found that , for some of the greatest values for @xmath1 allowed by the cosmic reionization physics , and assuming the best possible performance of the experiment , a detection of @xmath1 , at the 2@xmath4 level , is possible .",
