    "since increasing the interaction strength drives the system toward zero polarization and therefore a perfectly screened mean - field ground state , the system is not susceptible to density - wave fluctuations . the dispersion relations above this mean - field ground state consists of two weakly - coupled modes that cross at large enough interaction strengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionlowbeta ] ) .",
    "one of the modes is a spin - wave mode gapped at zero momentum that undergoes an avoided crossing with the gapless density - wave mode , leading to a roton - like feature at finite momentum that softens as @xmath232 is increased .",
    "the avoided crossing is narrow , which means that the character of the lower branch of the full dispersion relation switches , and the instability that arises therefore has a spin - wave character .",
    "thus , far from the stability threshold , the polarization is uniform , but as the stability threshold is approached , fluctuations arise at a wavelength of about @xmath292 that give rise to domains of opposite polarization .",
    "this is explained by the fact that at large enough density , the energy cost for flipping domains of dipoles against the external field becomes on the order of the energy benefit from attractive interactions between nearby domains of oppositely - aligned dipoles .",
    "effectively , the local field due to nearby domains of dipoles nearly cancels out the external field , zeroing out the energy cost of aligning dipoles against the field .",
    "these fluctuations are of pure spin - wave character , as density - wave fluctuations are suppressed due to the net zero polarization of the mean - field ground state .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structurelowfield ] , where the density - density correlation functions are featureless , whereas the spin - spin correlation functions display strong correlations over large distances .",
    "the spin structure factor develops a strong feature at a wavelength of about @xmath292 , and this feature diverges at the stability threshold .",
    "the instability is caused by the strong lateral interactions between adjacent domains of opposite polarization , indicating that the instigated collapse should be longitudinal .",
    "the two instabilities just described are characterized by different competitions of energy scales .",
    "the density - wave roton arises due to the competition of trap and interaction energy scales , whereas the spin - wave roton arises due to the competition between the zero - field splitting and the interaction energy scales . in the high - field limit ,",
    "the gas is fully polarized , and the zero - field splitting is irrelevant , whereas in the low field limit , the influence of the zero - field splitting dominates over the influence of the external field .",
    "finally , in the intermediate regime , our picture is one of a spin - wave - assisted density - wave instability , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : assistedschematic ] .",
    "the argument is as follows . at intermediate fields",
    ", a roton - like feature appears in the lower branch of the dispersion relation due to the strong coupling between the spin - wave and density - wave modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionlowbeta ] ) , although it is not the result of a crossing between the modes . at interaction strengths where this roton appears",
    ", strong features appear in both the density and spin structure factors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structurelowfield ] ) .",
    "spontaneous fluctuations in the system can set up a density wave in which the regions of higher density have a polarization small enough that there is no local collapse , indicating that there is no density - wave instability at intermediate field strengths ( see dashed curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : stability ] ) .",
    "however , at the same time , the gas is susceptible to spontaneous spin - wave fluctuations with a wavelength comparable to that of the density - wave , leading to larger polarizations within the high - density regions , thereby hastening the local collapse .",
    "we have identified three distinct mechanisms for the collapse of a two - state , dipolar bec in quasi-2d under the influence of an external polarizing field .",
    "the strong - field behavior is the well - understood density - wave rotonization that occurs in fully polarized dipole bec s trapped in quasi-2d .",
    "it is a consequence of the competition between energy scales of the attractive interactions between dipoles lined up end - to - end and the confinement induced by the trapping .",
    "in contrast , the low - field and intermediate - field behaviors are consequences of the dielectric character of the system , where the polarizability of the individual molecules in the condensate plays a crucial role . at very low fields ,",
    "the gas is stabilized against density - wave fluctuations due to screening in the ground state , and interactions tend to drive the system towards zero polarization . however , the attractive interactions that arise when adjacent domains of opposite polarization appear are strong enough to overcome the energy cost associated with flipping dipoles against the external field . in the intermediate field ,",
    "the system is stabilized against a density - wave collapse due to the fact that interactions drive the system towards a low polarization , partially screened state . however , superposed polarization and density - waves lead to local polarizations large enough to instigate a collapse analogous to the instability that occurs in the high field limit .",
    "we have also identified three molecules that are candidates for experimentally realizing these results . while gases composed of rigid - rotor molecules such as rbcs are closest to being made quantum degenerate , the densities required for accessing the dielectric instability are experimentally inaccessible . even if the densities were achievable , it is likely that three - body losses would dominate in those regimes  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we focus on the molecules with either a @xmath0-doublet or a doublet-@xmath1 structure .",
    "the zero - field splitting of the @xmath0-doublet in tho is @xmath293 ( @xmath294 )  @xcite .",
    "given a trap frequency of 5 khz , this corresponds to @xmath295 , which is what we have used for the majority of the results presented in this paper .",
    "the zero - field dielectric instability occurs at @xmath296 , and since the maximum dipole moment ( in strong applied fields ) of tho is @xmath297 ( @xmath298 )  @xcite , this corresponds to a 2d density of @xmath299 .",
    "the maximum 3d density @xmath300 occurs at the center of the trap , and for this choice of parameters , @xmath301 . in molecules such as srf",
    ", there are two low - lying states of opposite parity whose splitting can be tuned via an external magnetic field .",
    "the splitting is zero at 5370 g and is approximately 100 mhz at @xmath302 g  @xcite , allowing experimenters to easily access small values of @xmath248 , and therefore small values of @xmath232 and reasonable values of @xmath303 . the combination of a tunable zero - field splitting and the fact that a gas of srf molecules can be laser - cooled  @xcite makes srf an enticing candidate for future experimental investigation of the results presented in this paper .    in real systems ,",
    "the gases are confined in all three dimensions in a so - called `` pancake '' geometry . in these setups ,",
    "a low - momentum cutoff is introduced due to the finite size of the system , and the correlations seen in the density - density , two - point correlation functions manifest as density striping  @xcite . in the low - field limit of our model , we expect polarization striping to appear in the absence of density striping when the gas is harmonically confined in the plane , which is the subject of ongoing investigation .",
    "the theoretical methods presented in the first part of this paper comprise a general method for investigating the mean - field ground state and low - lying excitations of a bec of dipolar molecules purely analytically .",
    "the long - range nature of the dipole - dipole interactions result in momentum - dependent coupling constants in the bogoliubov - de gennes fluctuation hamiltonian , but this hamiltonian can be diagonalized analytically at every non - zero momentum with a sequence of physically motivated canonical transformations .",
    "this procedure generalizes to situations where the internal states of the molecules in a bec are linearly coupled , and the molecules interact via direct , long - range interactions .",
    "we acknowledge many fruitful discussions with j.  l.  bohn , b.  l.  johnson , r.  v.  krems , c.  ticknor , e.  timmermans , and h.  r.  sadeghpour .",
