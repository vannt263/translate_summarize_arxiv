    "since the discovery of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of atoms in optical traps , the field of ultracold atoms has experienced tremendous developments in the recent years.@xcite a first important step has been the use of fano - feshbach resonances@xcite to tune the strength of atom - atom interaction.@xcite fano - feshbach resonances take place when the energy difference between the molecular state in the closed channel and the threshold of the two - atom continuum in the open channel , known as the detuning @xmath0 , is zero@xcite . near a fano - feshbach resonance ,",
    "the atom - atom scattering length possesses a singularity . for @xmath1 , atoms are stable , but the existence of the virtual molecular state results in an effective attraction . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the molecules are formed and possess a weakly repulsive interaction . since the value of @xmath0 can be controlled by an applied magnetic field , this allows to tune the sign and strength of the atomic and molecular interactions.@xcite in particular , the use of fano - feshbach resonances has allowed the observation of pairs of fermionic@xcite or bosonic@xcite atoms binding together to form bosonic molecules . at sufficiently low temperature , for @xmath2 , these molecules can form a bose - einstein condensate . in the case of a fermionic system , for @xmath1 , due to attractive interactions",
    "a bcs superfluid is expected .",
    "since the bec and the bcs state break the same u(1 ) symmetry , a smooth crossover between the two states is expected as @xmath0 is tuned through the resonance .",
    "indeed , the bec of molecules@xcite and the crossover to a strongly degenerate fermi gas@xcite have been observed as a gas of cold fermionic atoms is swept through the fano - feshbach resonance .",
    "measurement of the radio - frequency excitation spectra@xcite and of the specific heat@xcite as well as observation of vortices in a rotating system@xcite on the @xmath1 side revealed the presence of a superfluid bcs gap , thus proving the existence of a bec - bcs crossover .",
    "such a crossover is naturally described by the boson - fermion model , @xcitefirst introduced in the 1950s in the context of the theory of superconductivity@xcite and later reinvestigated in the 1980s in the context of polaronic@xcite and high - tc superconductivity theory.@xcite a second important parallel development has been the possibility to form quasi-1d condensates using anisotropic traps@xcite , two - dimensional optical lattices@xcite or atoms on chips.@xcite in one dimensional systems interactions are known to lead to a rich physics.@xcite in particular , strongly correlated states of fermions , where individual particles are replaced by collective spin or density excitations , are theoretically expected.@xcite when the interactions between the fermions are repulsive , both the spin and density fluctuations are gapless with linear dispersion and this state is known as the luttinger liquid@xcite . for attractive interactions between the fermions , the spin degrees of freedom develop a gap , yielding a state known as the luther - emery liquid.@xcite similarly , bosons are expected to be found in a luttinger liquid state , with individual particles being replaced by collective density excitations@xcite . moreover",
    ", strong repulsion can lead to the fermionization of interacting bosons i.e. the density matrix becomes identical to that of a non - interacting spinless fermion system , the so - called tonks - girardeau ( tg ) regime.@xcite experiments in elongated traps have provided evidence for one - dimensional fluctuations@xcite . however , in these systems , the bosons remain weakly interacting . with two - dimensional optical lattices ,",
    "it is possible to explore a regime with stronger repulsion . in particular , it was possible to observe the tg regime with @xmath3rb atoms@xcite by increasing the transverse confinement .",
    "the tg regime can also be reached by applying a 1d periodic potential along the tubes to increase the effective mass of the bosons@xcite . using a stronger 1d potential , it is possible to drive a one - dimensional mott transition between the superfluid state and an insulating state@xcite .",
    "another characteristic of atoms in a one - dimensional trap is that transverse confinement can give rise to a type of fano - feshbach resonance as a function of the trapping frequency called the confinement induced resonance ( cir).@xcite recently , experiments have been performed on @xmath4k fermionic atoms in a one dimensional trap forming bound states either as a result of fano - feshbach resonances or of cir.@xcite both types of bound states have been observed and the results can be described using the boson - fermion model.@xcite this prompts the question of whether a one dimensional analogue of the bec - bcs crossover could be observed in such a system .",
    "it is well known that in one dimension , no long range bec or bcs order can exist.@xcite however , quasi - long range superfluid order is still possible . for fermions with attractive interactions , it was shown using the exactly solved gaudin - yang model@xcite that for weakly attractive interactions , a luther - emery state with gapless density excitations and gapful spin excitations was formed , whereas for strongly attractive interactions the system would crossover to a luttinger liquid of bosons.@xcite the boson - fermion model was also considered in the case of a broad fano - feshbach resonance.@xcite in that case only bosons or fermions are present ( depending on which side of the resonance the system is ) and the results are analogous to those obtained with the gaudin - yang model .",
    "in fact , in the three dimensional case , it is possible to derive a mapping of the boson - fermion model with a broad resonance to a model with only fermions and a two - body interaction.@xcite in the narrow resonance case , such a mapping is valid only very close to the resonance .",
    "it was therefore interesting to investigate what happens in one dimension in the case of a narrow resonance .",
    "indeed , in the latter case , it has been shown previously@xcite that a richer phase diagram could emerge with a phase coherence between a fluid of atoms and a fluid of molecules at weak repulsion and a decoupling transition for stronger repulsion .",
    "analogous effects have been discussed in the context of bosonic atoms with a fano - feshbach resonance in@xcite .",
    "due to the concrete possibility of forming 1d fermi and bose gas with optical lattices @xcite some of the theoretical predictions in the narrow resonance case may become testable experimentally in the future .",
    "experimental signature of the phase coherence between the two fluids include density response and momentum distribution function . in the present paper ,",
    "we investigate in more details the phase in which the atomic and the molecular fluid coexist .",
    "in particular , we study the equilibrium between the atomic and the molecular fluid as the detuning is varied . also , we investigate the effect of placing the system in a periodic potential and show that the phase coherence between the atomic and molecular fluid hinders the formation of the mott state in systems at commensurate filling .",
    "such conclusion is in agreement with a study in higher dimension@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec.[sec :",
    "hamiltonian ] we introduce the boson - fermion hamiltonian both in the lattice representation and in the continuum .",
    "we discuss its thermodynamics in the limit of an infinitesimal boson - fermion conversion term and show under which conditions atoms and molecules can coexist . in sec.[sec : boson - appr ] we derive the bosonized expression for the boson - fermion hamiltonian valid in the region where atoms and molecules coexist .",
    "this hamiltonian is valid for a system in an optical lattice provided it is at an incommensurate filling ( i.e. with a number of atoms per site which is not integer ) .",
    "we show that for not too strong repulsion in the system , a phase where the atomic and the molecular superfluid become coherent can be obtained .",
    "this phase possesses a spin gap .",
    "we show that in this phase the order parameter for the bec and the bcs superfluidity order parameter are identical , while charge density wave correlations present an exponential decay .",
    "we discuss the phase transitions induced by the detuning , the magnetic field and the repulsion .",
    "we also exhibit a solvable point where some correlation functions can be obtained exactly . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mott - insul - state ] , we consider the case where the number of atoms per site in the optical lattice is integer . we show that a phase transition to a mott insulating state can be obtained in that case . however , there is no density wave order in this mott state . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : param - boson - hamilt ] , we discuss the applicability of our results to experiments .",
    "we consider a system of 1d fermionic atoms with a fano - feshbach resonance.@xcite this 1d system can be obtained by trapping the fermions in a two dimensional or a three dimensional optical lattice . in the first case ,",
    "the fermions are trapped into 1d tubes , in the second case , a periodic potential is superimposed along the direction of the tubes . in the case in which the fermions are injected in a uniform potential ,",

    "since these interactions are short ranged , it is convenient to assume that they are of the form @xmath12 .",
    "the term @xmath0 is the detuning .",
    "finally , the term @xmath13 allows the transformation of a pair of fermions into a fano - feshbach molecule and the reverse process .",
    "this term can be viewed as a josephson coupling@xcite between the order parameter of the bec of the molecules , and the order parameter for the superfluidity of the fermions . as a result of the presence of this term , pairs of atoms are converted into molecules and vice - versa , as in a chemical reaction@xcite . as a result of this ,",
    "only the total number of atoms ( paired and unpaired ) , @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the number of molecules and @xmath16 is the number of unpaired atoms ) is a conserved quantity .    in the case where atoms are injected in a periodic potential , @xmath17 it is convenient to introduce the wannier orbitals@xcite of this potential . in the single band approximation",
    "the hamiltonian reads : @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 annihilates a fermion of spin @xmath8 on site @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 creates a fano - feshbach molecule ( boson ) on the site @xmath20 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the hopping integrals of the fermions and bosons are respectively @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 is the detuning .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 measure ( respectively ) the fermion - fermion , boson - boson , and fermion - boson repulsion .",
    "the case of hard core bosons corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "the conversion of atoms into molecules is measured by the term @xmath30 .",
    "again , only the sum @xmath31 is conserved .",
    "we note that within the single band approximation , there should exist a hard core repulsion between the bosons .      in this section",
    ", we wish to study the behavior of the density of unpaired atoms @xmath33 and of the density of atoms paired in molecules @xmath34 as a function of the total density of atoms ( pair and unpaired ) @xmath35 in the limit of @xmath36 .",
    "in such a limit , the fermion - boson conversion does not affect the spectrum of the system compared to the case without fermion - boson conversion .",
    "however , it is imposing that only the total total number of atoms @xmath37 is conserved .",
    "therefore , it this limit there is a single chemical potential @xmath38 and the partition function reads : @xmath39=\\mathrm{tr}[e^{-\\beta[h_\\lambda-\\mu(n_f+2n_b ) ] } ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and : @xmath40 in the absence of fermion - boson conversion , @xmath15 and @xmath16 would be separately conserved , and one would have a chemical potential @xmath41 for the molecules and @xmath42 for the atoms .",
    "the partition function of this hypothetical system would read : @xmath43=\\mathrm{tr}[e^{-\\beta[h_0-\\mu_f n_f- \\mu_b n_b ] } ] ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus : @xmath44=z_0[\\mu,2\\mu ] .   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we further assume that @xmath45 , we have @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the hamiltonian of the fermion subsystem and @xmath48 is the hamiltonian of the bosonic subsystem , and the partition function  ( [ eq : partition - no - conversion ] ) factorizes as @xmath49=z_f[\\mu_f ] z_b[\\mu_b]$ ] , where @xmath50=\\mathrm{tr}[e^{-\\beta[h_\\nu-\\mu_\\nu n_\\nu}]$ ] for @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath52 , we obtain the following expression of the number of unpaired atoms @xmath16 and the number of atoms paired in molecules @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath53 we now use these equations  ( [ eq : atom - number ] ) and ( [ eq : molecule - number ] ) to study the coexistence of bosons and fermions as the detuning @xmath0 is varied .",
    "two simple cases can be considered to illustrate this problem of coexistence .",
    "first , one can consider bosonic molecules with hard core repulsion and noninteracting fermionic atoms .",
    "in such a case , the thermodynamics of the gas of molecules is reduced to that of a system of spinless fermions by the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite , and the expression of the densities of unpaired atoms and molecules can be obtained in closed form . in this simple case , it is straightforward to show that for sufficiently negative detuning all atoms are paired into molecules , and for sufficiently positive detuning all the atoms remain unpaired .",
    "the case of intermediate detuning is more interesting as coexistence of unpaired atoms with atoms paired into molecules becomes possible .",
    "the physical origin of this coexistence is of course the molecule - molecule repulsion that makes the chemical potential of the gas of molecules increase with the density so that in a sufficiently dense gas of molecules , it becomes energetically favorable to create unpaired atoms . to show that the above result is not an artifact of having a hard core repulsion ,",
    "we have also considered a slightly more realistic case of molecules with contact repulsion and non - interacting atoms .",
    "although in that case we can not anymore obtain closed form expressions of the density of molecules , we can still calculate numerically the density of molecules using the lieb - liniger solution@xcite .",
    "we will see that having a finite repulsion between the molecules indeed does not eliminate the regime of of coexistence .",
    "in that case we assume that the boson - boson repulsion @xmath54 in the lattice case and @xmath55 in the continuum case is going to infinity . using the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite",
    ", one shows that the partition function of these hard core bosons is equal to that of free spinless fermions thanks to the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "for positive temperature , the number of unpaired atoms and the number of atoms paired into molecules read : @xmath56 for @xmath57 , these equations reduce to : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fermi momentum of the atoms and @xmath60 is the fermi momentum of the spinless fermions ( i.e. the pseudo - fermi momentum of the molecules ) . up to now , we have not specified the dispersion of the atoms and of the molecules . in the lattice case , these dispersion are obtained from eq .",

    "this implies either a ground state degeneracy ( associated with a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry ) or the existence of gapless excitations ( if the spontaneous translational symmetry is unbroken and the ground state is unique ) . for integer @xmath0 , the ground state and the state @xmath351 have the same momentum . in that case",
    ", a gapped state without degeneracy can be obtained .",
    "this state is analogous to the mott insulating state in the half - filled hubbard model in one - dimension@xcite or the mott insulating state in the bose - hubbard model with one boson per site@xcite .",

    "the condition to have a mott insulating state in the hubbard model , @xmath357 is thus generalized to @xmath358 i.e. @xmath359 .      in this section , we provide a derivation of the umklapp term valid in the case of the lattice system  ( [ eq : lattice ] ) .",

    "let us consider first the case of @xmath364 .",
    "then , the term ( [ eq : umk - source ] ) is oscillating . in second order perturbation theory",
    ", it gives rise to the umklapp term : @xmath365 the condition for the appearance of the umklapp term  ( [ eq : umklapp ] ) can be seen to correspond to having one fermion atom per site of the atomic lattice .",
    "let us briefly mention two alternative derivations of ( [ eq : umklapp ] ) .",
    "a simple derivation can be obtained by considering the combination of the @xmath366 term in the boson density with the @xmath367 term in the fermion density in haldane s expansion@xcite .",
    "a second derivation can be obtained by considering the effect of a translation by one lattice parameter on the phases @xmath368 and @xmath369 @xcite .",
    "the expressions of the densities ( [ eq : fermion - density - bosonized ] ) and ( [ eq : boson - density - bosonized ] ) imply that upon a translation by a single site @xmath370 and @xmath371 .",
    "therefore , the combination @xmath372 transforms as : @xmath373 . for @xmath374 , the term @xmath375 is invariant upon translation , thus leading again to ( [ eq : umklapp ] ) .",
    "the presence of the umklapp term  ( [ eq : umklapp ] ) in the hamiltonian can result in the opening of a charge gap and the formation of a mott insulating state .",
    "since the umklapp term is of dimension @xmath376 this implies that a mott insulating state is possible only for @xmath377 i.e. very strong repulsion . for free fermions ,",
    "the mott transition would occur at @xmath130 i.e. for weakly repulsive interaction .",
    "thus , we see that the josephson coupling is very effective in destabilizing the mott state . in the mott insulating state , the superfluid fluctuations become short ranged .",
    "since cdw fluctuations are also suppressed , the system shows some analogy with the haldane gapped phase of spin-1 chains@xcite in that it is totally quantum disordered .",
    "in fact , this analogy can be strengthened by exhibiting an analog of the vbs ( valence bond solid ) order parameter@xcite . in haldane",
    "gapped chains , this nonlocal order parameter measures a hidden long range order in the system associated with the breakdown of a hidden discrete symmetry in the system . the equivalent nonlocal order parameter for the atom - molecule system is discussed in appendix  [ app : non_loc_ord ] .",
    "another commensurate filling , where a mott insulating state is possible is obtained for @xmath378 .",
    "this case corresponds to having one molecule ( or two atoms ) per site of the optical lattice . in that case , the term in ( [ eq : umk - source ] ) is non - oscillating , and it gives rise to an umklapp term of the form : @xmath379 we notice that this umklapp term is compatible with the spin gap induced by the josephson term ( [ eq : lambda - bosonized ] ) .",
    "when the josephson coupling is large , we can make @xmath380 and we see that the term ( [ eq : umklapp - boson ] ) becomes relevant for @xmath381 . for weaker josephson coupling ,",
    "the dimension becomes @xmath382 , and this term is relevant only for @xmath383 .",
    "since @xmath384 corresponds to hard core bosons , this means that for weak josephson coupling , the mott state with a single boson per site becomes trivial .",
    "interestingly , we note that increasing the josephson coupling is _ enhancing _ the tendency of the system to enter a mott insulating state as a result of the formation of a spin gap .",
    "if we compare with a system of bosons at commensurate filling , we note however that the mott transition would obtain for @xmath385@xcite . therefore",
    ", the josephson coupling still appears to weaken the tendency to form a mott insulating state .",
    "such tendency was also observed in @xcite",
    ".      when the atomic subsystem is at commensurate filling ( @xmath386 ) , an umklapp term : @xmath387 must be added to the hamiltonian .",
    "such umklapp term can create a gap in the density excitations of the unpaired atoms .",
    "however , we must also take into account the term  ( [ eq : lambda - bosonized ] ) .",
    "this term is ordering @xmath185 and thus competes with the umklapp term ( [ eq : umklapp - fermions ] ) . to understand what happens when @xmath185 is locked , it is convenient to rewrite the umklapp term ( [ eq : umklapp - fermions ] ) as @xmath388 .",
    "the terms generated by the renormalization group are of the form @xmath389 , with @xmath390 an integer . when @xmath185 is locked , replacing the terms @xmath391 by their expectation values , we find that all these terms vanish . therefore , no term @xmath392 can appear in the low energy hamiltonian .",
    "a more formal justification of the absence of the @xmath393 term in the low energy hamiltonian can be given by noting that when the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of @xmath176 it has a continuous symmetry @xmath394 and @xmath395 .",
    "as a result , terms of the form @xmath396 are forbidden by such symmetry .",
    "the consequence of the absence of @xmath392 terms in the hamiltonian when @xmath185 is locked is that , even if the unpaired atom density is at a commensurate filling , the umklapp terms do not destabilize the coupled phase .",
    "however , in the opposite case of a strong umklapp term and a weak boson - fermion conversion term , it is the field @xmath368 that will be ordered .",
    "the previous arguments can be reversed and show that the formation of a mott gap for the fermions will prevent the formation of the coupled phase . using the method of ref.@xcite , one can show that the phase transition between the coupled and the decoupled state is identical to the phase transition that occurs in two non - equivalent coupled two - dimensional xy models .",
    "this phase transition was studied by the renormalization group in @xcite .",
    "it was found that in the case of interest to us , this phase transition was in the ising universality class .",
    "thus , one expects a quantum ising phase transition between the state where the fermions are decoupled from the bosons and form a mott insulator and the state where the fermions and bosons are coupled and form a superfluid .    of course , the same arguments can also be applied to the bosons at commensurate filling , the role of the fields @xmath369 and @xmath368 being simply reversed .",
    "to connect experiments in quasi - one - dimensional confining waveguides with theoretical models in 1d , it is necessary to obtain estimates of the parameters that enter the hamiltonians ( [ eq : lattice]),([eq : nolattice ] ) and the bosonized hamiltonian ( [ eq : bosonized - spin]),([eq : lambda - bosonized ] ) and ( [ eq : detun - bosonized ] ) . since the parameters in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : lattice ] ) depend on the periodic optical trapping potential , we will mainly focus on the parameters that enter in the continuum hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : nolattice ] ) and in the bosonized hamiltonian , i.e. the luttinger exponent @xmath137 , the velocity , and the fermion - boson coupling @xmath13 . before giving an estimate of the parameters we need first to remind that , at the two - body level",
    ", there is a connection between the 1d boson - fermion model and the quasi-1d single channel model@xcite , thus we will use one or the other depending on the physical parameter wherein we are interested .",

    "the mass is roughly 6 times the mass of the proton , @xmath398 , and for @xmath4k it is @xmath399 .",
    "then , we need to determine the effective interaction of atoms under cylindrical confinement . for the interaction , we will assume a contact form , i.e. @xmath400 and the hamiltonian describing the confined atoms reads : @xmath401 where @xmath402 , the second term represents the harmonic confinement potential , and : @xmath403 is the atom - atom repulsion .",

    "it is known that virtual transitions to higher states can give rise to a divergence in 1d scattering length known as confinement induced resonance ( cir ) which is a kind of fano - feshbach resonance@xcite .",

    "we have seen that bosons are only weakly interacting and the necessary small fermionic luttinger parameter required to realize a strongly interacting system , render the mott insulating and decoupled phases difficult to observe in experiments .",
    "a nontrivial challenge is the experimental realization of the coupled luttinger liquids phase with parameters tunable through the exactly solvable point ( the luther - emery point ) .",
    "we suggest that a fano - feshbach resonantly interacting atomic gas confined in a highly anisotropic ( 1d ) trap and subject to a periodic optical potential is a promising candidate for an experimental measurement of the physical quantities ( correlation functions ) discussed here .",
