    "the meson - baryon - baryon @xmath9 couplings play a central role in hadron physics concerning the baryon - baryon @xmath10 interactions as well as the formation and decay of baryon resonances . to study these couplings effective",
    "hadron lagrangians involving the mesons and baryons under consideration are postulated .",
    "all the complexity of the @xmath11 vertices is assumed to be taken into account through running couplingsdepending on @xmath12 , the transfer momentum in the vertex .",
    "this dependency is usually parametrized in terms of a form factor and a coupling constant defined as the value of the running coupling at a particular @xmath12 , usually on - shell @xmath13 .",
    "then one can calculate physical processes and compare to data to extract these values .",
    "thus the @xmath4 coupling constant is obtained from @xmath14 and/or @xmath3 scattering data  eri92 . for couplings involving baryons and/or mesons for which scattering or decay data",
    "are not so complete  or unavailable one can also rely on symmetry to derive predictions , see for instance  @xcite .    from a more fundamental point of view hadrons are made up of quarks .",
    "hence hadron structures and decays as well as hadron - hadron interactions should come out from quark dynamics as dictated by qcd . due to the technical difficulty to achieve this objective at present quark models of hadrons incorporating qcd - motivated symmetries and dynamics",
    "have been successfully applied to generate the baryon - baryon interactions , and consistently the baryon spectrum , in the light @xmath15",
    "@xcite as well as in the light + strange @xmath16 quark sectors  @xcite .",
    "these models , sometimes less precise than effective hadronic treatments , offer the advantage of providing a consistent unified description of all baryon - baryon processes from the same hamiltonian at the quark level .",
    "this confers them in principle a great predictive power once the model parameters are tightly constrained from some selected set of existing data .",
    "we shall make use of this power to predict , within a non - relativistic chiral quark model framework , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 : baryon of the flavor octet ) coupling constants in terms of meson - quark - quark ( @xmath19 couplings .",
    "more precisely we shall generate , from a @xmath20 lagrangian incorporating the effect of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( scsb ) , the quark - quark meson exchange potentials and from them , through a born  oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation , the asymptotic baryon ",
    "baryon meson exchange interactions .",
    "the use of justified harmonic oscillator baryon wave functions ( in terms of quarks ) will allow us to perform analytic calculations . by comparing the resulting interactions to the ones postulated at the effective hadronic level we shall identify the meson - baryon - baryon coupling constants .",
    "this procedure has been applied in the literature to the @xmath4 coupling  liu93 . here",
    "we shall be more precise in the extraction of coupling constants and form factors and we shall extend its application to the @xmath2 meson and the other @xmath18 baryons making feasible the comparison of our results to the ones obtained with alternative methods based on quark or hadron degrees of freedom .",
    "the contents are organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ secii ] we shall center on the light quark sector where spontaneously broken chiral su(2)@xmath0su(2 ) symmetry serves as an underlying general guide to generate the quark - quark meson - exchange potentials .",
    "we shall revisit the calculation of the @xmath4 coupling in terms of the @xmath21 one and apply the same procedure to the @xmath5 case .",
    "we shall also comment on the possibility of applying our method to @xmath22 and nucleon resonances . then in sect .",
    "seciii we shall consider the extension , via chiral su(3)@xmath23su(3 ) , to the su(3 ) octet of baryons . finally in sect .",
    "[ seciv ] we shall summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the chiral lagrangian @xmath25where @xmath26 has components @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the chiral @xmath20 coupling constant ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking gives rise to a vertex form factor @xmath31 @xcite . from the parametrization given in references  @xcite we propose the lorentz invariant form (",
    "note that for the purpose of the derivation of static potentials @xmath32 ) , @xmath33where @xmath34 is an effective cutoff parameter fitted from data .",
    "we should keep in mind that this parametrization of @xmath31 makes only sense for @xmath35    from the form proposed ( @xmath36 it is clear that @xmath29 represents the value of the @xmath20 coupling , @xmath37 at @xmath13 in the limit @xmath38 in order to deal with coupling constants defined on the physical meson masses ( @xmath39 we identify ( it is implicitly assumed that @xmath40 @xmath41@xmath42as the values of the coupling @xmath43 at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "let us point out that the use of the experimental pion mass may have required the introduction of an explicit symmetry breaking term proportional to @xmath2 in the lagrangian but this term has not any further effect in the analysis we perform . regarding the @xmath2 mass it will be taken as a parameter to be fitted from data around the value provided by the scsb relation  @xcite , @xmath46where @xmath47 denotes the constituent quark mass at @xmath48    in terms of @xmath49 we write the pion lagrangian as@xmath50with a vertex form factor @xmath51 given by @xmath52analogously , the sigma lagrangian reads @xmath53with a vertex form factor @xmath54 given by @xmath55note that both form factors are of the same type @xmath56 so that @xmath57      from @xmath59 and the form factors the static ope and ose central potentials ( to the respective lowest order in @xmath60 can be obtained through a non - relativistic reduction of the corresponding feynman diagram amplitudes .",
    "they are @xmath61 ( { \\vec{\\sigma}}_{i}\\cdot { \\vec{\\sigma}}_{j})({\\vec{\\tau}}_{i}\\cdot { \\vec{\\tau}}_{j})\\ , ,   \\label{ope}\\]]@xmath62 \\ , .",
    "\\label{ose}\\]]here @xmath63 and @xmath64 are numbers denoting quarks , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 are the spin ( isospin ) pauli operators , @xmath68 is the interquark distance and the function @xmath69 is defined as , @xmath70once the potentials at the quark level have been derived we shall use them to obtain the baryon - baryon potentials . from @xmath71 the asymptotic baryon - baryon meson exchange static potential is defined as @xmath72where @xmath73 stands for the two - baryon wave function , @xmath74 for the interbaryon distance and the integration is over the quark coordinates .",
    "we shall concentrate on @xmath75 interactions involving baryons with the same mass .",
    "then the asymptotic two - baryon wave function will be expressed in the center of mass system as @xmath76where @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the quarks forming the baryons , @xmath79 the baryons position and @xmath80is the one - baryon wave function expressed as the direct product of its spatial , spin  flavor and color parts . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the baryon spatial wave function will be chosen of harmonic oscillator type@xmath81   \\label{eqfin}\\]]with an harmonic oscillator parameter , @xmath82 , related to the size of the baryon .      in order to fix the parameters at the quark level : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath82 , we shall rely on the efficient description of @xmath3 data provided by the chiral quark cluster model ( cqcm ) @xcite .",
    "such model contains , apart from ope and ose potentials derived from @xmath59 , a confinement plus a residual one - gluon exchange ( oge ) interactions .",
    "we should realize though that the precise fitting of the parameters in the cqcm relies on a rgm calculation so that the two - baryon wave function as well as the baryon - baryon potentials are different from the ones obtained via the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approach we follow , eq .",
    "we shall take this into account in an effective manner by keeping the same values for @xmath47 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath82 , and fitting a new value for @xmath29 to reproduce , with our bo approach , the experimental value of the pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling constant ( see next section ) .",
    "the values of the parameters used henceforth are listed in table  [ t1 ] .       by making use of the @xmath87 degeneracy in our quark model",
    "we have also predicted @xmath88 on  shell couplings . concerning other diagonal @xmath58 couplings such as @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 to which our formalism could be also applied the situation gets complicated by the presence of the strange quark and/or antiquark which may give rise to relevant su(3 ) breaking effects out of the scope of our symmetry treatment .",
    "let us finally add that in our model goldberger - treiman relations of the form ( @xmath92 , where @xmath93 stands for the axial coupling constant and @xmath94 for the pion decay constant , can be immediately applied . in our non - relativistic description @xmath95 ,",
    "a value considerable larger than the experimental one @xmath96 consequently @xmath97 mev , which is @xmath98 bigger than the experimental value of @xmath99 mev . regarding these discrepancies it has been shown  @xcite that a relativistic treatment , beyond our present approach , could correct them to a good extent .",
