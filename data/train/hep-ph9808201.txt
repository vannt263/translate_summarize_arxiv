    "constituent quark models , on one side , and the parton picture , on the other side , represent two complementary descriptions of hadron structure @xcite . the rest frame ( or laboratory )",
    "description , based on constituent quarks , and the infinite momentum frame description ( @xmath0 ) , based on partons , appeared as formalisms capable of interpreting particle physics phenomena at different resolution scales . the algebraic approach , we are going to explore , seemed useful in establishing links between them @xcite .",
    "it was intensively investigated in the late sixties , but a quantitative scheme for interacting scenarios was never attained .",
    "the birth of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) set the general framework to understand deep inelastic phenomena beyond the parton model .",
    "the perturbative approach to qcd is able to connect observables at different resolution scales , but the realization of the complete project , i.e. , to fully understand the consequences of the dynamics of quarks and gluons , requires the input of unknown non - perturbative matrix elements to provide absolute values for the observables at any scale .    in the recent past the work by glck , reya and coworkers @xcite has shown that , starting from a parton parametrization at a low resolution scale @xmath1 , the experimental deep inelastic structure functions at high momentum transfer can be reproduced and even predicted @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is evaluated by evolving back the second moment of the valence distribution to the point where it becomes dominant .",
    "the procedure , suggested by parisi and petronzio @xcite , assumes that there exist a scale , @xmath1 , where the short range ( perturbative ) part of the interaction is negligible , therefore the glue and sea are suppressed , and the long range ( confining ) part of the interaction produces a proton composed of three ( valence ) quarks only .",
    "jaffe and ross @xcite proposed thereafter , to adscribe the quark model calculations of matrix elements to that , hadronic scale , @xmath1 . for larger @xmath2",
    "their wilson coefficients will give the evolution as dictated by perturbative qcd .",
    "in this way quark models , summarizing a great deal of hadronic properties , may substitute for low - energy parametrizations .",
    "following such a path , a partonic description can be generated from gluon radiation even off a purely valence quark system , which can be used to generate the non perturbative input occurring in the operator product expansion ( ope ) analysis of lepton - hadron scattering in qcd @xcite . a systematic analysis based on non - relativistic potential models",
    ", shows that the approach can be consistently developed at next - to - leading order both for polarized and unpolarized structure functions @xcite , including non - perturbative contributions from the nucleon cloud @xcite or from the partonic substructure of the constituent quarks@xcite .",
    "the formulation of this naive approach has been motivated by simplicity and by the success of the constituent models in reproducing many properties of the hadronic spectrum in the 1 - 2 gev region .",
    "it has been quite evident , since the original formulation of many of these models , that relativistic effects to the nucleon wave function , as well as , covariance requirements , are needed even for a phenomenological description of the structure of hadrons .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of a possible generalization of our approach in that direction , and we will show that relativistic covariance can be incorporated within the same framework in a rather transparent and elegant manner . to this aim",
    "we develop a constituent quark model in the light - front realization of the hamiltonian dynamics and apply to it the formalism for the calculation of both polarized and unpolarized parton distributions .    in the next section",
    "we proceed to reformulate the procedure using the hamiltonian formalism in the light front dynamics .",
    "a light - front constituent quark model is defined and its momentum distributions are related to the quark distribution function at the hadronic scale in the conventional way .",
    "the third section is dedicated to analyze , under different hadronic conditions , the perturbative evolution required to reach the scale of the data .",
    "two scenarios , characterized by the presence or absence of soft gluons at the hadronic scale , are studied .",
    "we end by summarizing our results and discussing those points , which at the light of our presentation , require further development .",
    "a schematic phenomenological distinction between constituent quarks and partons is often made by differentiating the infinite momentum frame , where partons show up , from the laboratory rest frame , where the constituent quarks appear to be the relevant degrees of freedom responsible for the correct symmetries and quantum numbers .",
    "of course such a schematic point of view is only approximate and can also be at the origin of some misunderstanding . actually the two descriptions appear well defined in the light - front description of deep inelastic scattering , where the parton model is recovered , in the bjorken limit , due to the dominance of short light - cone distances ( @xmath3 ) in the relevant feynmann diagrams . as a consequence",
    "the partonic description can be developed in the rest frame of the hadron by using light - cone formalism .",
    "in particular the @xmath4-th parton distribution can be related to the light - cone momentum density ) can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "( [ dval ] ) includes the support correction as discussed in the same reference . ] .",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the light - cone momentum fraction of the struck parton in the rest frame , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nucleon and parton mass respectively and @xmath9 , @xmath10 represent the light - cone density momentum density of the @xmath4-th parton whose spin is _ aligned _ ( @xmath11 ) or _ anti - aligned _ ( @xmath12 ) to the total spin of the parent nucleon . if one assumes that at the scale @xmath1 only the @xmath13 and @xmath14 constituent quarks are resolved , the momentum densities can be written @xmath15 the light - cone distributions ( [ n_up / down ] ) have been evaluated in the past making use of non - relativistic constituent quark models , while in the present investigation we want to improve their description including relativistic effects as introduced by a light - front formulation of a three - body interacting system . as a consequence",
    "we will remain within a constituent picture where the partons in the rest frame are identified with three ( constituent ) quarks at the hadronic scale , and covariance requirement is fulfilled .",
    "since the hadronic scale @xmath1 turns out to be very low ( @xmath16 gev@xmath17 ) , close to the constituent quark mass ranges from 0.094 gev@xmath17 , if only valence quarks are considered , to 0.37 gev@xmath18 , when non - perturbative @xmath19 pairs and gluons are included .",
    "] , we assume that the constituent picture at this scale has to be identified with a constituent quark model , whose parameters are fixed to reproduce the basic features of the nucleon spectrum in the energy region @xmath20 gev .      before discussing the details of the quark wave functions , it is worth to remark the main features of the theoretical framework that we have employed to achieve a covariant description of the nucleon s constituent degrees of freedom .",
    "an exhaustive review of covariant hamiltonian dynamics can be found in @xcite .    on a quantum level ,",
    "the covariance requirement is formulated by demanding the probability assigned to a given event to be the same in all inertial frames . according to wigner theorem @xcite ,",
    "this is achieved if ( and only if ) the correspondence between the states in different frames is realized by means of an unitary representation @xmath21 of the poincar group .",
    "the connected component of the poincar group is a ten parameter lie group that includes four space time translations , three rotations and three lorentz boosts .",
    "let us denote with @xmath22 the representations of the generators of space - time translations , with @xmath23 those of lorentz boosts , and with @xmath24 those of @xmath25 .",
    "any linear combination of generators is still a generator . to achieve a covariant formulation of the poincar algebra",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new set of tensor generators of the lorentz group : @xmath26 the tensor character of these operators is expressed by the following relationships : @xmath27    starting from the equations ( [ tensor1 ] ) and ( [ tensor2 ] ) it is possible to work out the following algebra : @xmath28   =   0 , \\ ] ] @xmath29   = i(g^{\\mu\\nu}p^{\\rho}-g^{\\rho\\nu}p^{\\mu}),\\ ] ] @xmath30   =   i(g^{\\mu\\sigma}j^{\\nu\\rho}-g^{\\mu\\rho}j^{\\nu\\sigma } -g^{\\nu\\sigma}j^{\\mu\\rho}+g^{\\nu\\rho}j^{\\mu\\sigma}).\\ ] ]    hence , in order to build a covariant quantum mechanical model , one has to construct a model hilbert space and find a set of operators such that these commutation relations are satisfied .    in general ,",
    "such a representation is not unique and depends on the interaction .",
    "however , it is possible to single out a subset of generators which do not contain the interaction .",
    "such operators group together to form the _ kinetic subgroup_. once the kinetic subgroup is determined , the whole set of generators is also fixed including the _ hamiltonian _ generators ( i.e. those operators which contain the interaction ) .",
    "dirac proposed @xcite to fix first the kinetic subgroup identified with the stability group of a three - dimensional surface in minkowski s space , and then extract the hamiltonian generators by group representation properties .    the choice of the surface that determines the kinetic subgroup fixes the _ form of the dynamics_. in the following we will use the light - front form of the dynamics whose invariant surface is the light - front ( null ) plane @xmath31 .",
    "this form of the dynamics has many important properties , for example , it leads to the largest possible kinetic subgroup .    in the light - front form of the dynamics , it is convenient to consider the following set of generators : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( kinetic subgroup ) and @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( set of hamiltonians ) .",
    "in particular , the role of the hamiltonian @xmath39 of non relativistic quantum mechanics is played , in the front form , by the generator @xmath40 of translations along the direction orthogonal to the null plane .",
    "this operator has a positive eigenvalued spectrum and this prevents the existence of negative `` energy '' states , allowing for the number of particles to be fixed .",
    "for this reason the light - front form of the dynamics is particularly well suited to describe a low energy model where only three valence quarks are considered .",
    "the construction of a representation of the poincar space such that the kinetic subgroup is the stability group on the light - front , is clearly much easier by using a parametrization of the minkowski space which is as close as possible to the symmetry of the problem , i.e. the light - front coordinates : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in this way a vector is given by @xmath45 , an the scalar product by @xmath46 .",
    "the null plane is the plane with @xmath47 and the `` ( three)-vector '' @xmath48 on that plane is a true three - vector under light - front boosts ( i.e. the boost belonging to the kinetic subgroup ) .    in order to model",
    "the hilbert space one needs to combine the generators of the poincar group to get a set of self commuting operators which have a physical interpretation . by combining @xmath49",
    ", @xmath50 one can construct two invariants : i ) the mass operator @xmath51 ii ) and the square ( @xmath52 ) of the _ pauli - lubansky _ vector : @xmath53    in relativistic systems the definition of the spin operator is related to the pauli - lubansky vector : one defines , in fact , the square of the spin by @xmath54 it can be proved that there is an infinite set of operator - valued vectors satisfying the relation ( [ lubaspin ] ) .",
    "therefore , the spin operator is defined as a linear combination of @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 the coefficients @xmath58 are space - like operator - valued vectors of an orthonormal basis @xcite . different choices of this basis leads to the specific definition of spin in different forms of the dynamics . starting from ( [ spindef ] ) one can prove that the spin operator transforms as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is called wigner rotation .",
    "one can demonstrate that defining @xmath61 , the 16 components quantity @xmath62 forms a @xmath63 representation of a lorentz transformation .",
    "the spin operator can be written @xmath64 where the last equality holds when the system is made up of @xmath65 independent constituents . in the _ instant form _ of the dynamics",
    "( in which the invariant surface is chosen to be the equal - time plane ) the wigner transformations associated to a rotation is the rotation itself and the spin is called _ canonical_.",
    "one can demonstrate that , in this form of the dynamics , the ordinary composition rules of the angular momentum hold , providing one rotates the constituent spins by means of appropriate wigner rotations . in the case of light - front form of the dynamics , the wigner rotations associated to a light - front boosts are the identity .",
    "the ordinary composition laws for the total angular momentum hold , provided we transform the light - front spin into the canonical spin .",

    "( [ massop ] ) ) have been fixed to reproduce the low - lying nucleon spectrum as discussed in section [ numsol ] .",
    "the effect of relativistic covariance in the quark wave function is mainly associated to the spin dynamics induced by the melosh rotations ( cfr .",
    "eqs.([meloshs1 ] ) , ( [ meloshs2 ] ) , ( [ q - melosh ] ) ) and these transformations lead to a strong suppression of the structure function in the small-@xmath148 region ( @xmath200 ) .    in order to introduce the gluons non perturbatively we evolve the unpolarized distributions predicted by the scenario a , up to the scale of scenario b where 60% of the total momentum is carried by valence quarks . at that scale",
    "we add to the valence partons the non - perturbative gluons as defined in eq .",
    "( [ nonpg ] ) of section [ nonpgluo ] .",
    "moreover , at the new hadronic scale , the fraction of polarized gluons is chosen to be _ negative _ according to jaffe s result @xcite or _ positive _ as in other parametrizations .",
    "note that by choosing a negative fraction we are maximizing the difference with respect to the radiative gluons , because those yield to a positive polarization .",
    "6 leads us to confirm that the low-@xmath148 data on @xmath201 do not constrain the gluon polarization strongly .",
    "if we vary the fraction of polarized gluons from 35% to 100% the quality of the agreement is not significantly changed in the region @xmath197 . for larger values of @xmath148",
    "the valence contribution plays a major role and the behavior of the structure functions might depend on the model wave functions .    for both scenarios",
    "the boundary value @xmath1 is rather low and one could question on higher order contributions to the evolution . in order to appreciate ( and maximize ) the relevance of nnlo ( or higher order ) effects , the polarized proton structure function are evolved at @xmath202 gev@xmath17 within the scenario a and by using both lo and nlo approximations ( cfr .",
    "fig .  4 ) .",
    "in the region of @xmath203 they differ roughly of 20% which represents the order of magnitude of the largest higher leading effects .",
    "the same evolution obtained within the scenario b would lead to an even smaller difference ( @xmath204 ) between lo and nlo results .",
    "the comparison of the predicted neutron structure function with the data ( fig .",
    "5 ) differs quite substantially according to the amount of polarized gluons at the hadronic scale . within scenario",
    "a the values of @xmath205 remain quite small according to the fact that the mass operator chosen ( [ massop ] ) is @xmath127 symmetric .",
    "the introduction of _ negative _ gluon polarization brings the predictions of the present relativistic quark model closer to the experimental observations at least in the @xmath206 region ; a larger _ negative _ fraction of gluon polarization is favored by the data as can be argued also from the results of _ positively _ polarized gluons as shown in the same figure .",
    "any how , since the neutron structure function is largely dependent on the nucleon wave function model , our assumption on @xmath127 symmetry is the largest source of uncertainty and a more detailed study of @xmath207 should include more complex wave function models .",
    "another source of uncertainty in our evaluation of the neutron stucture function is the lack , at the hadronic scale , of ( polarized ) sea contributions which can play even a major rle for @xmath208 @xcite .",
    "all these limitations , however , do not obscure the main aim of our study , namely the discussion on the effects due the relativistic requirement of the quark wave function .    fig .",
    "6 is devoted to the gluon distributions .",
    "within scenario a the polarized gluon distributions remain _ positive _ at the experimental scale as a result of the nlo evolution . on the contrary a large amount of _ negative _ gluon polarization is predicted within scenario b if one assumes anti - aligned gluons at the hadronic scale .",
    "the distribution is largely dependent on the polarization fraction .",
    "the dotted line of fig .",
    "6a shows the consequence , in the deep inelastic regime , of the jaffe s calculation at low energy .",
    "the absence of non - perturbative sea polarization results in a huge ( and probably unrealistic ) amount of negative gluon polarization to reproduce the neutron data .",
    "such a large amount of gluons is , however , inconsistent with the unpolarized gluon distributions as it is shown in fig .",
    "6b ( dotted line again ) .",
    "7 shows the results of the analysis on the factorization scheme dependence .",
    "we have chosen to show both the proton and the more appreciable case of the polarized neutron data .",
    "the small difference gives us confidence in the results .",
    "figs .  8 and 9 complete our study of unpolarized partons ( gluons are shown in fig .",
    "6 as already mentioned ) .",
    "particularly evident is the improvement , due to the high momentum components introduced by the relativized solution , in describing the proton @xmath209 distribution in the region @xmath210 .",
    "the non - relativistic description is largely suppressed for @xmath211 due to the lack of high momentum contributions .",
    "the solution of the mass operator ( [ massop ] ) have the appropriate components to contribute in this @xmath148-region .",
    "the work is completed by the comparison of lo nlo evolution also in the case of unpolarized scattering ( fig .  8a ) and the results on valence and sea distributions ( fig .  9 ) . in this last case",
    "one could repeat the comments already formulated for the polarized distributions : the lack of non - perturbative sea at the hadronic scale largely limits the possibility of reproducing the parton distributions in the singlet sector .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a semi - quantitative analysis of the effects due to relativistic covariance requirement in the study of polarized structure functions within constituent quark models .",
    "the investigation clearly shows the relevance of relativistic effects due , in particular to the dynamics of the spin observables in special relativity .",
    "in fact two new ingredients play a major rle in our light - front calculation : i ) the presence of high momentum components and ii ) the spin dynamics induced by the melosh transformations .",
    "\\i ) the large amount of high momentum components in the nucleon wave function is generated by the solution of the relativized mass equation ( [ massop ] ) and are relevant in reproducing the large @xmath148 behavior of polarized and unpolarized structure functions .",
    "the lack of such high momentum contributions have been repeatedly stressed in connection with non - relativistic calculations @xcite without reaching a satisfying solution within non - relativistic quark models .",
    "\\ii ) the melosh rotation dynamics introduce the basic new ingredient in the calculations and its effect is quite sizeable in suppressing the proton response in the region @xmath212 .",
    "the first natural extension of the present discussion is the study of transversity distributions as they will be investigated by drell - yan processes .",
    "in fact relativity must play a quite sizeable rle for that observable @xcite and the light - front dynamics is a privileged tool to study such effects .",
    "in addition to the advantages of our approach we want to stress also its limitations and approximations because a further study should remove them in order to provide a more quantitative study of the nucleon spin within the light - front dynamics .    the most relevant limitation of the present investigation is probably the lack of ( non - perturbative ) sea contributions at the hadronic scale due to the meson cloud of the nucleon .",
    "the effects can be rather large and significant in particular for the spin response of the neutron .",
    "work in this direction is in progress and we want to extend the investigation of non - relativistic approaches @xcite inserting the recent successful description of the meson cloud @xcite within a coherent light - front formulation @xcite    a second limitation is determined by the particular choice of the quark - quark interaction of eq .",
    "( [ massop ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in few points of the present paper the large @xmath148 behavior of the nucleon response can be affected by the specific choice of the interquark interaction model .",
    "work is in progress to investigate the numerical solutions of more sophisticated hyper - central potentials already discussed in the non - relativistic limit @xcite .",
    "in addition we did not include hyperfine interaction terms in our analysis and we would like to extend the approach also to the consistent light - front treatment of such interaction .    finally the factorization scheme dependence is to be investigated in more detail in connection with radiative model studies of the kind discussed in the present paper .",
    "we acknowledge useful conversations with s. scopetta regarding factorization schemes and with f. cano on the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ dval ] ) to the light - front approach .",
    "this work has been supported in part by dgicyt - pb94 - 0080 and the tmr programme of the european commission erb fmrx - ct96 - 008 .",
