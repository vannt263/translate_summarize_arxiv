    "the issue of magnetism in band - ferromagnets like fe , co and ni is far from being settled .",
    "magnetism in this materials is due to correlations within itinerant electron bands .",
    "the simplest model that comprises this aspects is the single - band hubbard model .",
    "although it was introduced to gain a first qualitative understanding of band - ferromagnetism@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite it took almost 30 years to answer the question whether it is a generic model for ferromagnetism at all .",
    "about ten years ago a dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite@xmath0 @xcite@xmath0 @xcite@xmath0 @xcite was developed , which allows a consistent ( mean field ) description of the whole parameter range of the single - band hubbard model .",
    "dmft - based calculations confirmed the existence of ferromagnetism for a wide parameter range@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "today there is a general consensus that the single - band hubbard model exhibits ferromagnetism .",
    "+ there is also consensus , however , that this model oversimplifies the situation in band - ferromagnets , for instance by restricting the correlations to the on - site elements .",
    "but an even more drastic simplification is the restriction to a single non - degenerated electron band .",
    "the fivefold degeneracy of the d - electrons certainly influences the magnetic properties of the system .",
    "consequently , a lot of effort is being done by transferring certain treatments , once developed for the single - band model , to multi - band models .",
    "let us mention gutzwiller approximation @xcite or various treatments within the dmft - frame@xcite@xmath0@xcite . + besides the degeneracy of the d - electrons , the single - band model also neglects weakly correlated @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands , although they are located around the fermi energy in @xmath3 transition - metals . the interplay between correlated and uncorrelated electrons",
    "is known to give rise to a variety of phenomena such as the kondo effect or heavy fermions@xcite and is the central point of widely used models like the anderson model . in the case of the periodic anderson model ( pam ) ,",
    "correlations in combination with the hybridization to an uncorrelated band can cause ferromagnetism@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite as shown rigorously for the one - dimensional case at quarter filling@xcite .",
    "this indicates that uncorrelated bands may influence the magnetic phase diagram of the hubbard model , too , and this is most likely if the band distance is smaller than the on - site coulomb energy ( charge transfer regime@xcite ) .",
    "recent experiments indeed seem to indicate that ferromagnetism can be stabilized if additional p - orbitals are doped into a @xmath4-system(@xmath5)@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to decide , whether the neglect of @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands is justified when modeling band - ferromagnets like fe , co , or ni .",
    "the influence of the hybridization of @xmath6-electrons with these orbitals shall be investigated systematically .",
    "+   + the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "a suitable hamiltonian is formulated and we try to give a qualitative overview of the interplay between the two different kinds of electrons . in section [ theory ] we will apply certain approximations to the hamiltonian . thereby we will try to get as much insight as possible into the mechanisms , by which the @xmath6-band magnetism is altered .",
    "while the above mentioned dmft - based treatments give certainly reliable values for magnetic properties , it is challenging to give a direct physical meaning to auxiliary quantities used in this theory ( e.g. the energy- and spin - dependent hybridization function ) .",
    "for these reasons we will formulate the much simpler hubbard - i decoupling ( _ hu - i_)@xcite , the spectral density approach ( _ sda_)@xcite , and the modified alloy analogy ( _ maa_)@xcite for the described multi - band model .",
    "these theories are conceptually restricted to high energy excitations in the strong coupling regime .",
    "this is , however , the interesting case concerning band - ferromagnetism . for the single - band model in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions",
    "the theories are thoroughly tested against numerical exact results available in this limit@xcite .",
    "it is found that the _ sda _ as well as the _ maa _ systematically overestimate magnetic quantities such as the curie temperature but turn out to give a qualitative satisfying description of band - ferromagnetism@xcite@xmath0@xcite . for our purpose",
    "the main advantage of these theories is the possibility for analytical estimations . + in section [ results ]",
    "the main results concerning the p - band influence on ferromagnetism are shown . within the _ sda",
    "_ we will derive analytical expressions for the quasiparticle band structure in the strong coupling limit .",
    "this allows a vivid physical interpretation of the mechanism by which the properties of the correlated subsystem are influenced by uncorrelated bands .",
    "we will see that the main impact is due to spin dependent inter - band fluctuations , which may enhance or reduce the spin asymmetry of the interacting density of states .",
    "finally we discuss alternative mechanisms that involve the new states , like superexchange and rkky - coupling .",
    "we want to study the influence of weakly correlated bands to @xmath6-band ferromagnetism within the following extension of the single - band hubbard model : @xmath7 this hamiltonian is similar to those used e.g. in reference @xcite and reduces to the periodic anderson model ( pam ) in the limit @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "the weakly correlated electrons are described by a quasi - free `` @xmath2-band '' , with the hopping integrals @xmath10 , while the single - band hubbard model describes the @xmath6-system .",

    "the hopping integrals are the fourier transformed bloch energies and @xmath14 denotes the chemical potential .",
    "the free band structure @xmath15 shall be the result of a tight - binding approximation .",
    "the relative position of the bands is characterized by two parameters : the difference of the free centers of gravity @xmath16 and the ratio of the free band widths @xmath17 : @xmath18 @xmath19 are the centers of gravity of the free bands . to achieve a realistic description of transition metals we choose @xmath20 and @xmath21 . as a consequence of the tight binding approximation",
    "the dispersions are connected via @xmath22 let us now discuss the possible influences of the @xmath2-band on the @xmath6-system within this model .",
    "+ first of all , there is a rather trivial particle number effect@xcite .",
    "magnetism depends sensitively on the @xmath6-particle density .",
    "if now the new band is added while the total particle number in the system stays fixed , the electron density within the correlated subsystem is changed .",
    "the same holds if the parameters @xmath13 or @xmath16 are tuned .",
    "we do not want to address these effects here .",
    "note , that our intention is not to describe effects resulting from an experimental tuning of the hybridization strength , e.g. by applying pressure .",
    "rather we want to decide if the neglect of the @xmath23-@xmath6 hybridization is a good approximation for many body model calculations . in this context",
    "it is assumed that even when the @xmath1- and @xmath2-electrons are neglected the correct @xmath6-particle number per site is used .",
    "this generally non - integer number is already the result of the hybridization to other bands .",
    "thus we will regard this case ( where the change of the @xmath6-particle number due to the hybridization is already considered ) and the case of an explicitely treated hybridization ( where additionally all other effects resulting from the two - band situation are taken into account ) . to compare these cases",
    "properly we have to fix the @xmath6-particle density in our calculations . + what further effects can be expected ?",
    "naively , one would believe that an uncorrelated and therefore a priori `` non - magnetic '' @xmath2-band would destabilize ferromagnetism by `` reducing the average correlation '' .",
    "this reasoning , however , is too simple .",
    "particle fluctuations between the bands will influence the propagation of electrons within the @xmath6-band and thus the @xmath6-projected density of states .",
    "it is known that ferromagnetism depends sensitively on the the shape of the density of states@xcite .",
    "this effect will be most important if the fluctuation rate is spin - dependent .",
    "this would cause different alterations of the spin - up and spin - down density of states and directly influence its spin asymmetry .",
    "+ let us look at this mechanism in the trivial limiting case of uncorrelated bands @xmath24 . for small hybridizations",
    "the excitation energies are : @xmath25 for the lower band @xmath26 this causes a band asymmetry , a band shift to lower energies , and a band broadening in the quasiparticle density of states . for non - overlapping bands ,",
    "i.e. @xmath27 , we insert ( [ alpha ] ) into ( [ dispersionen ] ) and expand @xmath26 in powers of @xmath28 .",
    "equation ( [ dispersionen ] ) becomes @xmath29 with the band shift @xmath30 and the band broadening factor @xmath31 the broadening as well as the shift are also present if the @xmath6-electrons are correlated as can be seen by studying a two - site cluster out of ( [ ham ] ) with the inter - site hoppings @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for small @xmath13 one can perform a canonical transformation that decouples the @xmath2- and @xmath6-band in first order in @xmath13 .",
    "the calculation is lengthy but straightforward . for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and",
    "@xmath36 the @xmath6-electrons are well approximated by a two - site hubbard hamiltonian with a renormalized center of gravity @xmath37 , renormalized hopping integrals @xmath38 , and a renormalized interaction @xmath39 .",
    "we find the parameters @xmath40 the broadening as well as the shift is clearly recognized in ( [ cluster ] ) .",
    "our preceding , qualitative considerations indicate that inter - band particle fluctuations indeed modify the d - projected density of states .",
    "these modifications are expected to influence also the magnetic properties . up to now",
    "we only investigated spin - symmetric limiting cases allowing only a spin symmetric fluctuation rate .",
    "regarding ferromagnetism it will be most important whether one of the effects becomes spin - dependent in the full system .",
    "the magnetic properties of ( [ ham ] ) can be studied using retarded single electron green functions @xmath41 which fulfill the following equations of motion : ] @xmath42 the self - energy @xmath43 is introduced as usual via @xmath44_-;d_{k\\sigma}^+\\rangle\\rangle\\quad , \\label{def.sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath45_-$ ] denotes the commutator . solving ( [ eom ] )",

    "+ obviously we can calculate the phase boundary between para- and ferromagnetism as soon as we have found an ( approximate ) expression for the self - energy .",
    "+ to this aim we will formulate the _ hu - i _ , _ sda _ , and _ maa _ for the two - band problem ( [ ham ] ) . by comparing the influence of the hybridization within different approximations",
    "we can minimize the risk of an artificial @xmath2-band influence .",
    "the two `` simple '' approximations _",
    "hu - i _ and _ sda _ can give an excellent insight into the working mechanisms .",
    "due to their explicit structure of the self energy , one can perform some demonstrative analytical estimations .",
    "the _ sda _ gives qualitatively convincing results concerning ferromagnetism .",
    "this is due to the fact that it reproduces the correct values for the centers of gravity and weights of the hubbard bands in the strong coupling limit @xmath34 . compared to _ hu - i",
    "_ , an additional correlation function is considered that describes the itineracy of electrons of opposite spin direction and allows for a spin - dependent band shift .",
    "the _ maa _ is a first systematic improvement of the _ sda _ , since it allows quasiparticle damping , which is completely neglected within the _ sda_. by comparing _",
    "maa_- and _ sda_-results one can see , if the mechanisms derived within the _ sda _ are also present in a more complex theory .",
    "+   + * hubbard - i decoupling * : let us start with the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "straightforward decoupling of the real space equations of motion in ( [ matrix ] ) yields the _ hu - i _ self - energy @xmath54 which is formally identical to the single - band case .",
    "the self - energy is @xmath13-dependent via @xmath55 , which is calculated using ( [ matrix ] ) and ( [ nvonro ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ hu - i ] ) gives three excitation energies in every point of the brillouin - zone , corresponding to the three - peak structure of the spectral density in the atomic limit @xmath56 .",
    "finite values of the hopping and hybridization change the positions and weights of the @xmath57-peaks and lead to a mixing of @xmath58 and @xmath59 spectral density . +   + * sda * for the single - band model , the _ sda _ is the simplest theory that yields the correct strong coupling and high energy behaviour , which seems to be decisive for the existence of ferromagnetism .",
    "the general structure of the spectral density and the self - energy is the same as in _ hu - i_. the energy - positions and weights of the @xmath57-peaks in the spectral density are obtained by fitting it to the first four spectral moments : @xmath60_-h]_-\\ldots h]_-}_{m - fold},d_{k\\sigma}^+]_+\\rangle\\quad . \\label{momente}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath45_+$ ] is the anti - commutator . for the two - band model we will apply this concept directly to the self - energy rather than to the spectral density .",
    "therefore we choose the same structure as in ( [ hu - i ] ) for a self - energy ansatz : @xmath61 the parameters @xmath62 shall now be fitted to the spectral moments . to this end",
    "we expand the green function and the self - energy with respect to powers of @xmath63 : @xmath64 the high - energy coefficients of the green function are the spectral moments ( [ momente ] ) .",
    "this can easily be seen by expanding the spectral representation of the green function @xmath65 with respect to @xmath63 and comparing the resulting expressions with the definition of the moments ( [ momente ] ) .",
    "the self - energy coefficients @xmath66 are obtained as functions of the moments @xmath67 by inserting the expansions ( [ hochenergie ] ) into ( [ matrix ] ) ( or equivalently into the dyson equation ) and by comparing the coefficients of the @xmath68 terms . with the r.h.s . of ( [ momente ] ) , we find the first four correlated spectral moments : @xmath69 the self - energy coefficients read : @xmath70 @xmath71 is a higher correlation function with the local part @xmath72 and a @xmath73dependent part @xmath74 . for the single - band model , the influence of both terms is discussed in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the most important term is the local @xmath75 , which leads to a spin - dependent band shift in the ferromagnetic phase . with regard to ferromagnetism",
    "the non - local part @xmath76 seems to be of minor importance",
    ". therefore we will neglect it in the following . from ( [ momente ] )",
    "we find for the local part @xmath72 : @xmath77 although @xmath78 contains expectation values of the uncorrelated band and higher correlation functions , it can be expressed as a functional of the correlated single - electron green function only : @xmath79 the correlation - function @xmath72 and the self - energy coefficients @xmath80 turn out to be the same functionals of the correlated green function @xmath81 as in the single - band model . while determining the self - energy coefficients , the whole @xmath13-dependence in the moments @xmath82 ( [ zweib - moments ] ) is cancelled by the explicit @xmath13-dependence of the correlated green function ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "thus , like in the _ hu - i _ approximation , the _ sda _ self - energy is formally identical to the single - band case : @xmath83 the @xmath84dependence comes again into play by the expectation values @xmath85 and @xmath86 being evaluated via ( [ matrix ] ) , ( [ nvonro ] ) , and ( [ be ] ) .",
    "+   + * maa * besides the restriction to strong interaction strengths a drawback of _ sda _ and _ hu - i _ is the exclusion of scattering processes , which lead to quasiparticle damping .",
    "the correlated @xmath6-system is described by two quasiparticles with infinite lifetime corresponding to singly or doubly occupied sites .",
    "one possibility to include quasiparticle damping is the description of the system by a fictitious alloy ( alloy analogy ) , which is a standard method in many body physics@xcite . with this approach one can account for electron scattering at the potentials formed by the distribution of the electrons of opposite spin direction .",
    "main excitation energies of the many body system are modelled by atomic energy levels of a fictitious alloy .",
    "correlation effects are then described by the properties of this alloy and its self - energy is identified with the self - energy of the many body problem . since the self - energy ( [ def.sigma ] ) exclusively characterizes correlated electrons , we will only describe the correlated subsystem by a fictitious alloy . in the strong coupling limit we have two main excitation energies within the correlated subsystem .",
    "consequently we will describe it by a two - component alloy .",
    "the resulting effective alloy problem can be solved by the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) , which yields the cpa self - energy @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the atomic energy - levels and concentrations of the alloy components .",
    "the cpa , being a single - site theory , gives a local self - energy @xmath90 .",
    "after rearranging the terms and setting @xmath91 equation ( [ cpa ] ) becomes @xmath92 here @xmath93 is already used . to complete the theory",
    ", we now have to adjust the parameters @xmath94 , and @xmath95 .",
    "similar to the _ sda _ these parameters can be fitted to the on - site spectral moments @xmath96 and on - site self - energy coefficients @xmath97 .",
    "the two latters are defined analogously to @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( [ momente ] ) . to this purpose",
    "one has to expand the local green function @xmath81 and the local self - energy @xmath90 in powers of @xmath63 analogously to ( [ hochenergie ] ) .",

    "this feature is known to stabilizes ferromagnetism .",

    "these bands move apart with rising @xmath13 while the correlated sub - bands are broadened .",
    "one can see that the band shifts are proportional to @xmath107 , which agrees perfectly with the results for free bands ( [ dispersionen2 ] , [ shift ] , [ broad . ] ) and the two - site cluster ( [ cluster ] ) . +    fig .",

    "the magnetic properties can thus be changed drastically due to the presence of the uncorrelated band . within the framework of the _ sda _ we can derive analytical expressions for the shift and the broadening by calculating the poles of ( [ matrix ] ) with @xmath108 . for @xmath34 we find : @xmath109 where @xmath110 describes the whole influence of the hybridization .",

    "thus an hybridization with an uncorrelated band causes alterations in the band structure similar to the non - interacting case ( [ shift ] , [ broad . ] ) , i.e. a band shift and a band broadening for the correlated sub - band .",

    "<S> we investigate the influence of s - d or p - d hybridization to d - band ferromagnetism to estimate the importance of hybridization for the magnetic properties of transition metals . to focus our attention to the interplay between hybridization and correlation we investigate a simple model system consisting of two non - degenerated hybridized bands , one strongly correlated , the other one quasi - free . to solve this extended hubbard model </S>",
    "<S> , we apply simple approximations , namely sda and maa , that , concerning ferromagnetism in the single - band model , are known to give qualitatively satisfactory results . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows us to discuss the underlying mechanism , by which d - band ferromagnetism is influenced by the hybridization on the basis of analytical expressions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter clearly display the order and the functional dependencies of the important effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is found , that spin - dependent inter - band particle fluctuations cause a spin - dependent band shift and a spin - dependent band broadening of the hubbard bands . </S>",
    "<S> the shift stabilizes , the broadening tends to destabilize ferromagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> stabilization requires relatively high band distances and small hybridization matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> super - exchange and rkky coupling are of minor importance . </S>"
