    "<S> thermal conductivity measurements have been performed on the superconducting ferromagnet ucoge down to very low temperature and under magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the electronic quasiparticle thermal conductivity , additional contributions to the thermal transport are detected : they are sensitive to the amplitude and direction of the magnetic field , and at low temperature , they display a strong anisotropy with the heat current direction . </S>",
    "<S> we identify these contributions as arising from magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> detection of such fluctuations on the thermal transport in 3d weak ferromagnets is very rare if not unique , and pledges for a strongly itinerant character of the magnetism of ucoge .    </S>",
    "<S> e - mail : jean-pascal.brison@cea.fr    the first superconducting ferromagnet , uge@xmath0 , has been discovered more than ten years ago @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the field has been continuously expanding with the discovery of the zero pressure ferromagnetic superconductors urhge @xcite and ucoge @xcite , as well as with the wealth of unconventional phenomena discovered when exploring their properties under pressure and magnetic fields @xcite . in ucoge , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-electrons are strongly involved in both magnetic and superconducting orders @xcite , and the magnetic ground state on which superconductivity develops is a cornerstone for the supposed equal - spin pairing superconducting ground state , as well as for the field dependence of the superconducting properties @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty to have a precise description of the ground state is usual in heavy - fermion systems , as rich physics does not arise in clear - cut limit cases , but in intermediate regimes where kondo effect , itineracy of the _ f_-bands and intersite magnetic interactions compete on equal footings . </S>",
    "<S> another difficulty comes specifically for these ferromagnetic superconductors , from the lack of microscopic data on the magnetic excitation spectrum at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> uge@xmath0 is the best known system , with inelastic neutron data at zero pressure showing that it is intermediate between a localized and itinerant system @xcite . under pressure , </S>",
    "<S> when the curie temperature ( @xmath2 ) is lowered together with the ordered moment , and superconductivity appears , it is likely that uge@xmath0 has gone closer to the itinerant electron limit case . for ucoge , </S>",
    "<S> nmr has succeeded to demonstrate the strong ising anisotropy of the static and dynamical properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also revealed the presence of longitudinal magnetic fluctuations up to very high temperature ( 80k ) compared to @xmath2 ( around 2.5 - 2.8k ) @xcite , as well as a strong suppression of these fluctuations by a magnetic field applied along the easy magnetization axis @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is focused on the normal state properties of ucoge , with the first study of thermal conductivity at low temperature and under magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , unexpectedly , thermal transport reveals a contribution of magnetic excitations at high temperature , and below @xmath2 , an anisotropic dispersion of these excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in agreement with the itinerant character of the magnetism of ucoge , even though it seems to be a rare case of weak ferromagnet where magnetic fluctuations act not only as a scattering mechanism , but also emerge as a proper channel for heat conduction </S>",
    "<S> . this feature may be due to the duality between the itinerant and localized character of the electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> ucoge crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the * c*-axis is the easy magnetization axis , the * a*- * b*-axis being the hard and intermediate axis respectively . </S>",
    "<S> high - quality single crystals were grown by the czhochralski method in a tetra - arc furnace , and further annealed . </S>",
    "<S> thermal conductivity has been measured on 4 different bar - shaped samples , cut along the different crystallographic directions ( 2 along the * c*-axis , 1 along * a * , and 1 along * b * ) , with very different residual resistivity ratios ( rrr , ranging from 16 up to 150 ) , which allowed to distinguish pure electronic quasiparticle contributions , from others ( phonons , spin fluctuations@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> they have been characterized by specific heat , laue x - ray diffraction and resistivity measurements . </S>",

    "<S> * a * , * b * and * c*-axis , with different rrr ( see text for labelling ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath6 does increase with the rrr at 0.5k , but is almost independent of the rrr above 3k . </S>",
    "<S> _ inset _ : resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    low temperature thermal conductivity measurements have been performed down to 10mk and up to 8.5 t with the standard one heater two thermometers setup . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , results under a magnetic field applied along both the * c*-axis and the * b*-axis will be presented for samples @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the electrical resistivity was measured simultaneously for all samples , so that the wfl could be checked for all samples ( @xmath9 when @xmath10 , @xmath11 the lorentz number and @xmath12 the resistivity ) . </S>",
    "<S> results are independent from the applied temperature gradient , which was typically @xmath13 , except for sample @xmath8 , where it was between @xmath14 and @xmath15 due to its higher conductivity . as physical properties have a strong angular dependence @xcite , the alignment of the samples in the magnetic field along the * b*-axis was adjusted in situ with two goniometers with piezo - electric actuators .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : k_rho_0 t ] shows the thermal conductivity divided by the temperature ( @xmath6 ) at zero field of the four samples up to 7k . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic and superconducting transitions are shown by the vertical dashed lines . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 shows a kink at @xmath2 , and at the superconducting transition ( @xmath16 ) , displays a kink in sample @xmath7 and a much weaker feature on the other samples ( @xmath17 is slightly above the maximum of @xmath6 ) . for each crystal , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 in the paramagnetic state ( above 3k ) varies very little whereas it increases strongly in the ferromagnetic state for samples with large rrr . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the resistivity ( in inset ) of all samples decreases monotonically in the same temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> so , above 3k , improvement of the electronic mean free path seems to have almost no effect on @xmath6 ( same value at 7k for all samples despite a factor three between the resistivity of samples @xmath7 and @xmath8 at this temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is even true in the whole temperature range investigated for sample @xmath7 , as @xmath6 continuously decreases on cooling despite the decrease of the resistivity ( suppression of inelastic scattering ) .     at 0 t and 6 t for the field in both directions . </S>",
    "<S> _ b ) _ the corresponding lorentz ratio , reaching 10 at 7k , but strongly suppressed for * * h**=6t//*c*. both point to an extra contribution to @xmath6 above 3k , suppressed by a field if it is directed along the * c*-axis.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    these opposite behaviors of charge and heat transport point to the existence of a sizable contribution to @xmath6 in addition to the electronic quasiparticle contribution ( @xmath5 ) , dominant for all samples above 3k , and in the whole temperature range for sample @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see below that the usual lattice contribution ( @xmath18 ) can only be part of this extra contribution : @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath20 ( temperature and field independent ) was consistently estimated to be in the range @xmath21 for the different samples , notably from the high field measurements , similar to estimates in other heavy fermion systems ( see cerhin@xmath22 for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we call extra contribution ( @xmath23 ) the thermal conductivity after removal of the quasiparticle and phonon contributions , assuming that the contributions of the different channels are additive : @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> .    @xmath23 is best seen on the lorentz ratio : @xmath25 , displayed on fig.[fig : kappa_a2]b ) for sample @xmath7 ( * * j**@xmath26//*c * ) : it reaches 1 when extrapolated at zero temperature , a good check of the validity of the measurements , but it is always superior to 1 at finite temperature , which confirms the presence of extra contributions , particularly dominant at high temperature ( @xmath27 larger than 10 at 7k in zero field ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the magnetic field is also visible on the same figure : for a field of 6 t for * h*//*b * , there is almost no effect on the lorentz ratio , whereas the same field applied along the * c*-axis reduces drastically @xmath27 .     or @xmath28 , see text ) of sample @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower curve ( full line ) shows the additional contribution ( @xmath29 ) , with a large almost model independent contribution below 0.5k . </S>",
    "<S> _ inset _ : the lorentz ratio at 0 t , 2 t and 6 t , * h*//*c*.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    a field of @xmath30 along the * c*-axis ( same fig.[fig : kappa_a2]a ) ) improves heat transport below @xmath31 , but reduces it above , whereas charge transport is improved by the applied field in the whole temperature range . so above 2k , the applied field ( * h*//*c * ) increases @xmath32 : the observed opposite decrease of @xmath6 in this temperature range has to arise from a strong suppression of @xmath33 , over - compensating the field increase of @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> this points to a sizable extra contribution to heat transport at high temperature , but also to its strong field dependence : hence the need for an extra contribution which can not be purely originated by phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the strong decrease of the lorentz ratio at high temperature under field along the * c*-axis , as well as the weak sensitivity of this ratio for fields along the ( intermediate ) * b*-axis is robust : it has been found on all measured samples . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig.[fig : kappa_a12 ] shows the effect on sample @xmath8 ( * h*//*c * ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : kappa_a12 ] shows the thermal conductivity of sample @xmath8 ( * * j**@xmath26//*b * ) at 2 t , * h*//*c * ( in the normal state ) . </S>",
    "<S> this sample has a rrr @xmath3410 times larger than sample @xmath7 , so a much larger electronic quasiparticle contribution is expected , which should translate in a lorentz number closer to 1 , or even smaller than 1 if inelastic scattering is dominant ( as observed in samples @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz number is indeed much smaller than for sample @xmath7 above 2k ( inset of fig.[fig : kappa_a12 ] ) , but not at low temperature : @xmath37 displays a maximum at around 0.5k , before reaching 1 only for @xmath38 . on the raw data , this maximum is well visible at 2 t , * h*//*c * , whereas the resistivity is monotonously decreasing on cooling . at 6 t , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum is still visible , although wider and smaller . </S>",
    "<S> so for this crystal , which has the largest electronic contribution , @xmath33 , suppressed also by a field * h*//*c * , seems to peak out not only at high temperature , but also in a very low temperature range ( where @xmath39 is clearly negligible ) .     </S>",
    "<S> has the same order of magnitude for the four samples whereas it is clearly anisotropic in the ferromagnetic state , and much larger for the heat current along the * b*-axis.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    when the electronic inelastic scattering is negligible compared to other mechanisms , @xmath5 can be simply deduced from the wfl , leading to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> a more refined treatment of the electronic quasiparticle contribution is required otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , inelastic scattering is known to be more efficient for the limitation of thermal conductivity than for the limitation of electrical conductivity , due to the presence of so - called `` vertical process '' ( with energy transfer at small momentum , affecting only the thermal resistivity ) . </S>",
    "<S> a sound estimate of the thermal conductivity is an extended wfl @xcite of the form @xmath41 @xmath42 is the residual resistivity and @xmath43 , where w@xmath44 and w@xmath45 are respectively the scattering rates due to inelastic vertical and horizontal processes , assuming that mathiessen s rule holds . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed also that @xmath46 is sample dependent , larger than 1 , but independent of temperature and field . </S>",
    "<S> this crude simplification can be valid for temperatures much smaller than the typical energy of the fluctuations responsible for the inelastic scattering , and has already been used for the heavy fermions upt@xmath47 @xcite or cerhin@xmath22 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an estimation of the different contributions is given fig.[fig : kappa_a12 ] for the sample @xmath8 at 2 t with * h*//*c * , and the estimated @xmath32 is shown for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the low temperature contribution ( below 1k ) is little sensitive to the value of @xmath46 , as expected from the small inelastic term of the resistivity below 0.5k , and that larger @xmath46 values can only enhance the high temperature contribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our estimation of @xmath33 ( @xmath50 for this sample ) , is a lower bound of this contribution .     of the thermal conductivity for samples @xmath8 ( panels * a ) * and * c ) * ) and @xmath7 ( panels * b ) * and * d ) * ) at 0 t , 2 t and 6 t . </S>",
    "<S> the panels * a ) * and * b ) * are for * h*//*c * , with strong suppression of this contribution , and the panels * c ) * and * d ) * for * h*//*b * , showing far less field dependence , and a broadening of the low temperature contribution of sample @xmath8.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the estimated extra contribution to the thermal conductivity ( which can not be attributed to the electronic or phononic heat transport ) is estimated in fig.[fig : kautre_0 t ] using eq.[eq : el_contr_fit ] , for all samples at zero field , above @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the precise temperature dependence of @xmath33 depends on the approximation used for @xmath46 ( temperature independent ) , nevertheless , two robust pieces of information can be extracted : i ) @xmath33 has approximately the same value at zero field in the paramagnetic state for all samples ; ii ) below 2k , the extra contribution decreases for all samples ( including these of high rrr like sample @xmath36 ) except for sample @xmath8 , which shows an increase below 1.5k ( see also the curve at 2 t in fig.[fig : kappa_a12 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> so quantitatively , the extra contribution is rather isotropic above 2k , but displays a strong anisotropy below this temperature , suggesting a change of the excitation spectrum responsible for this channel of heat conduction below @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : kautre ] shows @xmath33 at various fields ( only for samples @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) : @xmath33 is strongly suppressed by fields along the * c*-axis ( panels * a ) * and * b ) * ) , but weakly affected by fields along the * b*-axis ( panels * c ) * and * d ) * ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is strongly reminiscent of the behavior of the longitudinal fluctuations detected by nmr in this system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nmr found enhanced ferromagnetic fluctuations below 8k strongly affected by a field along the * c*-axis . </S>",
    "<S> so it is reasonable to identify this extra contribution to heat transport to the longitudinal spin fluctuations detected by nmr . </S>",
    "<S> the new information is that these modes can carry heat , so are not just incoherent local moment fluctuations but propagating modes . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that his contribution depends little of the crystallographic orientation above 2k , whereas it is much stronger along the * b*-axis than along the * c * or * a*-axis below this temperature : the spectrum of these magnetic fluctuations seems to change when the ferromagnetic order occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> let us point out that such a picture of long range magnetic fluctuations extending far above the ordering temperature ( nmr detects them up to 100k ) is typical of the scr ( self consistent renormalized ) model of spin fluctuations in weakly ferromagnetic metals , as opposed to the local moment picture where short range order rapidly disappears above @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scr theory investigates mainly the effects of spin fluctuations on the scattering rate of the conduction electrons @xcite , and not their own contribution to an additional channel for heat transport . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , in zrzn@xmath0 for example @xcite , the resistivity at 50k is still below 10  @xmath51 cm ( above 40  @xmath51 cm at 7k for the best sample of ucoge ) , so that @xmath5 is dominant in the whole temperature range and an extra contribution would not be detectable . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true for antiferromagnetic systems like cerhin@xmath22 @xcite , where resistivity at 7k is still 7 times smaller than that of ucoge .    </S>",
    "<S> a most striking feature of our results is the strong anisotropy of the extra contribution appearing below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong anisotropy has been also seen on the thermal expansion measurements @xcite : at @xmath2 , there is a large change along the * b*-axis , a smaller along the * c*-axis and almost no change along the * a*-axis , similarly to our measurements . </S>",
    "<S> both effects could be due to the predicted strong change of the fermi surface below @xmath2 @xcite , and its expected feedback on the magnetic excitation spectrum in an itinerant ferromagnet .    </S>",
    "<S> ucoge seems to be a rare case among metallic systems , where the spin fluctuation contribution to the thermal conductivity can be directly discriminated . </S>",
    "<S> magnon contributions in the ordered state have been reported in strong ( metallic ) ferromagnets ( see @xcite for example ) , or in insulating materials ( @xcite ) . but to the best of our knowledge , no `` paramagnon '' or spin fluctuation contribution has been reported yet : this may come from the tiny long range correlations of local moments above the ordering temperature , as opposed to the case of itinerant magnets . in ucoge , the contribution of spin fluctuations could also be favored by the absence of a gap , despite ising anisotropy : coupling to the fermi sea may indeed extend the fluctuation spectrum up to zero frequency ( see the strong ising cases of ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite or uge@xmath0 @xcite ) , as opposed to insulating materials . </S>",
    "<S> let us note that a direct extra magnetic contribution due to magnons has been recently reported in the heavy - fermion weak antiferromagnet ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 , the contribution is still visible at 60mt @xcite , above the critical field , so that it may be due also to magnetic fluctuations , like in ucoge , rather than to real magnons .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> thermal transport in ucoge reveals the presence of spin fluctuations , identified to the longitudinal fluctuations seen by nmr , with isotropic propagation above @xmath2 , and mainly * b*-axis propagation at lower temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it confirms an itinerant limit for the magnetism of this compound , despite the strong ising anisotropy of its magnetic properties , a key feature for the understanding of its superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> the strong anisotropy of the contribution to thermal transport of these fluctuations below @xmath2 may emerge from the possible dramatic change of the fermi surface across @xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it seems to be the first time that such a contribution is identified in metallic systems , and urges for theoretical investigations of direct heat transport by spin fluctuations in metallic weak ferro- or antiferromagnets . </S>"
