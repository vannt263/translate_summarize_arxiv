    "we have tested redundant arrays of integrated drive electronics ( ide ) disk drives , using the linux operating system , for use in particle physics monte carlo simulations and data analysis .",
    "parts costs of total systems using commodity ide disks are now at the $ 2000 per terabyte level .",
    "a revolution is in the making .",
    "our tests include reports on software and hardware redundant arrays of inexpensive disks  level 5 ( raid-5 ) systems running under linux .",
    "raid-5 protects data in case of a catastrophic single disk failure by providing parity bits .",
    "journaling file systems are used to allow rapid recovery ( minutes rather than days ) from system crashes and power failures .",
    "our data analysis strategy is to encapsulate data and cpu processing power together .",
    "data is stored on many pcs .",
    "analysis of a particular part of a data set takes place locally on , or close to , the pc where the data resides .",
    "the network backbone is only used to put results together .",
    "if the i / o overhead is moderate and analysis tasks need more than one local cpu to plow through data , then each of these disk arrays could be used as a local file server to a few computers sharing a local network switch .",
    "these commodity network switches would be combined with a single high end , fast backplane switch allowing the connection of a thousand pcs . to this end , we have also successfully measured the file transfer speed of network file system ( nfs ) software over a local gigabit network .    raid @xcite stands for redundant array of inexpensive disks .",
    "many industry offerings meet all of the qualifications except the inexpensive part , severely limiting the size of an array for a given budget",
    ". this is now changing .",
    "the different raid levels can be defined as follow :    * raid-0 : `` striped . ''",
    "disks are combined into one physical device where reads and writes of data are done in parallel .",
    "access speed is fast but there is no redundancy .",
    "* raid-1 : `` mirrored . '' fully redundant , but the size is limited to the smallest disk . * raid-4 : `` parity . '' for @xmath0 disks , 1 disk is used as a parity bit and the remaining @xmath1 disks are combined .",
    "protects against a single disk failure but access speed is slow since you have to update the parity disk for each write .",
    "some , but not all , files may be recoverable if two disks fail",
    ". * raid-5 : `` striped - parity . '' as with raid-4 , the effective size is that of @xmath1 disks .",
    "however , since the parity information is also distributed evenly among the @xmath0 drives the bottleneck of having to update the parity disk for each write is avoided .",
    "protects against a single disk failure and the access speed is fast .",
    "hardware and software raid-5 , using enhanced integrated drive electronics ( eide ) disks under linux software , is now available @xcite .",
    "redundant disk arrays do provide protection in the most likely single disk failure case , that in which a single disk simply stops working .",
    "this removes a major obstacle to building large arrays of eide disks .",
    "however , raid-5 does not totally protect against other types of disk failures .",
    "raid-5 will offer limited protection in the case where a single disk stops working but causes the whole eide bus to fail ( or the whole eide controller card to fail ) , but only temporarily stops them from functioning .",
    "this would temporarily disable the whole raid-5 array .",
    "if replacing the bad disk solves the problem , i.e.  the failure did not permanently damage data on other disks , then the raid-5 array would recover normally .",
    "to get a large raid array one needs to use large capacity disk drives .",
    "there have been some problems with using large disks , primarily the maximum addressable size .",
    "we have discussed these problems in an earlier papers @xcite . using arrays of disk drives , such as those shown in table [ disks ]",
    ", one can create multi - terabyte raid arrays .",

    "we have tested redundant arrays of ide disk drives for use in offline high energy physics data analysis and monte carlo simulations .",
    "parts costs of total systems using commodity ide disks are now at the $ 2000 per terabyte level .",
    "we have tested software raid-5 systems running under linux 2.4 using promise ultra 133 disk controllers and hardware raid-5 systems running under linux 2.4 and 2.6 using a 3ware hardware raid controller .",
    "we found about @xmath2 overhead for journaling files systems such as ext3 and reiserfs , but given the extra protection and increased recovery speed we still recommend them .",
    "we also found that software raid-5 has about @xmath3 more overhead than hardware raid but the use of dual - cpu systems or using the raid-5 array as a dedicated file server make this `` cost '' negligible for any modern cpu .",
    "raid-5 provides parity bits to protect data in case of a single catastrophic disk failure .",
    "tape backup is not required for data that can be recreated with modest effort . journaling file systems permit rapid recovery from system crashes and power failures .",
    "current high energy physics experiments , for example babar at slac , feature relatively low data acquisition rates , only 3 mb / s , less than a third of the rates taken at fermilab fixed target experiments a decade ago @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider experiments cms and atlas , with data acquisition rates starting at 100 mb / s , will be more challenging and require physical architectures that minimize helter skelter data movement if they are to fulfill their promise . in many cases , architectures designed to solve particular processing problems are far more cost effective than general solutions @xcite .",
    "grid computing @xcite will entail the movement of large amounts of data between various sites .",
    "raid-5 arrays will be needed as disk caches both during the transfer and when it reaches its final destination to ameliorate grid - lock .",
    "another example that can apply to grid computing is the fermilab mass storage system , enstore @xcite , where raid arrays are used as a disk cache for a tape silo .",
    "enstore uses raid arrays to stage tapes to disk allowing faster analysis of large data sets .",
