    "electron - transport calculations are important tools to investigate and develop materials for new electronic devices . recently , to obtain more practical knowledge on electron - transport properties of nanoscale structures , long - range and large - scale transport simulations have attracted much interest . however , such simulations are very hard task since huge computational costs growing with a system size are required .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop an efficient electron - transport simulator .    the lippmann ",
    "schwinger ( ls ) equation method proposed by lang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is one of popular methods , which enable us to obtain the scattering wave functions of nanoscale structures sandwiched between electrodes by solving the integral equation of the second - kind fredholm equation .",
    "when the reference system consists of only bare left and right electrodes with the empty transition region , scattering wave functions can be efficiently evaluated for a variety of structures of nanoscale junctions set up in the transition region by using the same reference green s function of the bare electrode system , where the computation of the reference green s function has only to be performed once . moreover , for a similar reason , the ls equation is utilized in the implementation of self - consistent calculations for the convergence of electronic states in infinitely open systems  @xcite . in the conventional ls equation method ,",
    "scattering wave functions are expressed in the laue representation , that is , the ls equation is solved by using a 2-dimensional plane - wave expansion in the directions parallel to the electrode surface ( lateral directions ) and a real - space discretization of the coordinate in the direction perpendicular to that ( longitudinal direction ) . in the ls equation method , however , one may frequently encounter a numerical difficulty such that a part of the green s function expressed in a variable - separable form drastically varies due to the appearance of evanescent waves exponentially growing and decaying in the longitudinal direction . to overcome this issue , in the previous study  @xcite , we proposed the procedure of the ratio expression for the green s function matrix elements in the laue representation as a remedy for avoiding the numerical collapse .",
    "so far , we developed the several simulators to elucidate the electronic properties of nanostructures based on the real - space finite - difference  ( rsfd ) approach  @xcite , in which the system is divided by equally spaced grid points , within the framework of the density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "for electron - transport simulations , the rsfd method has several advantages compared with the method of the laue representation from the fundamental and practical points of view .",
    "firstly , the finite differentiation for the kinetic - energy operator is treated on the _ equal footing _ in all three directions .",
    "this avoids numerical errors due to the artificial anisotropy between the lateral and longitudinal directions at any grid spacing .",
    "secondly , the computational accuracy can be improved by employing a higher - order finite - difference formula .",
    "thirdly , in the lateral directions , isolated boundary conditions are available as well as periodic ones , which enable us to treat electrodes as leads .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm of the rsfd method is suitable for massively parallel computing@xcite .    in this paper , we present the fully real - space based ls method and the ratio expression technique for the green s function of the reference system within the approach of the rsfd .",
    "this method is referred to the grid ls method . to demonstrate the performance of the grid ls method , we use it to investigate the electron - transport properties of the ( 001)si / sio@xmath0 and ( 001)ge / geo@xmath0 models connected to semi - infinite electrodes .",
    "we also estimate how the dangling bond  ( db ) caused by an oxygen vacancy contributes to leakage currents across the interface between the semiconductor and oxide .",
    "the results indicate that the leakage current attributed to the db state in the si / sio@xmath0 model is much larger than that in the ge / geo@xmath0 model .    in the followings of this",
    "paper , section  [ sec : level2 ] gives details of the computational scheme used to develop the grid ls method .",
    "section  [ sec : level3 ] presents a demonstration of our method , in which we use it to examine transport properties of si / sio@xmath0 and ge / geo@xmath0 models and to reveal how the leakage current is influenced by the db state that arises due to an oxygen vacancy .",
