    "attempts to unify fundamental interactions within a unique theory are not only based on aesthetic and philosophical grounds , but are also reinforced by experiments implying a convergence of the gauge - coupling strengths @xcite .",
    "we built here upon previous work @xcite@xcite trying to explain fermion family structure and the hierarchy between the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry scale and the coupling unification scale by introducing new fermions called `` katoptrons '' ( from the greek word for  mirror \" ) , since it is imperative to distinguish them from ordinary mirror fermions appearing in alternative models .",
    "stabilization of the ew scale is achieved by using a new gauge interaction @xmath0 becoming strong around 1 tev .",
    "the higgs mechanism is based on fermion condensates , in a spirit close to the study of qcd pions and similar to , but differing significantly from , technicolor @xcite . if katoptrons did not carry @xmath1 charges , they would be the mirror partners of the known fermions , the existence of which was first suggested in @xcite in order to restore the apparent left - right asymmetry in nature . breaking the electroweak symmetry dynamically by strongly - interacting mirror fermions",
    "was previously proposed also in @xcite by using different gauge symmetries than the ones appearing in the present paper , in order to achieve unification of the gauge coupling strengths , but failed to reproduce the correct weak scale .",
    "adding so many new particles seems to be required from a theory involving neither new elementary zero - spin particles , nor new energy scales fixed _",
    "ad hoc _ , nor too many arbitrary parameters .",
    "moreover , this approach can in principle produce testable predictions since the effects of these particles , if they exist at all , are expected to be studied at the lhc @xcite . in order to bring these considerations a step closer to gravity , the initial gauge symmetry was previously enlarged to @xmath2 in @xmath3 spacetime dimensions , with known fermions contained in @xmath4 and katoptrons in @xmath5 @xcite . since stabilization of extra dimensions is hard , it makes sense to wonder if too many , and hard to detect , degrees of freedom were added in that work . enlarging the gauge symmetry to such an extent could possibly suffice to bring us closer to gravity , avoiding the addition of extra dimensions by embedding the lorentz group within a larger symmetry @xcite .",
    "we proceed here towards this direction by adopting a bottom - up approach , going from lower energies where theories are well tested to higher energies where powerful theorems have to be surmounted , new theoretical methods have to be developed and experimental data are lacking .",
    "the constructive - inductive methodology followed should not obscure the ultimate consistency of the emerging picture if one wishes to start from planck energies and deduce the resulting physical phenomena on the way down to the weak scale .",
    "first , we inquire whether a particular breaking chain of an initial gauge symmetry @xmath6 down to the standard model is compatible with the unification of the gauge couplings near the planck scale and leads naturally to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking at scales of around 1 tev .",
    "we investigate whether the fermion fields surviving at lower energies and the effective composite fields leading to symmetry breaking appear naturally within this setting , a property which is _ a priori _ neither trivial nor obvious .",
    "next , an attempt is made to incorporate the lorentz group within the initial exceptional - group symmetry @xmath7 in order to judge whether the model proposed is in principle compatible with models of gravity based on spinors , which were so far based only on orthogonal groups , and which could potentially allow the inclusion of gravitational interactions in related unification considerations .",
    "then , an effort is made to justify the value of the gauge couplings at the unification scale using a rough order - of - magnitude calculation involving fermion condensates that would enable us to express the hierarchy between the weak scale and the planck scale in terms of a symmetry - group invariant .",
    "last , a novel mechanism of symmetry emergence is proposed within the framework of critical phenomena and spinor gravity , in order to reduce the arbitrariness of our choice of the initial symmetry @xmath7 . even though the problems arising in this emergence approach are mostly intractable analytically , one might be able draw useful qualitative conclusions on the critical temperature involved and derive order - of - magnitude results addressing several important cosmological issues like the value of the cosmological constant , the nature of dark matter and the interplay between space - time and elementary particles .",
    "we proceed below with our first task , _ i.e. _ the analytical calculation , in lowest order , of the relation between the weak scale and the coupling unification scale .",
    "one of the results of @xcite is coupling unification at high energies , including the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "the starting point here is a different initial symmetry @xmath7 assumed to break at energies @xmath8 down to @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate the running of the couplings in this case to see if the energy scales involved have theoretically and phenomenologically acceptable values . under @xmath9 , left - handed ordinary fermions @xmath10 and right - handed katoptrons",
    "@xmath11 are taken to transform as follows : @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a fermion generation superscript , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote non - abelian and abelian group singlets respectively , ordinary fermions are singlets under @xmath16 and appear in 3 generations , while katoptrons are singlets under @xmath17 and triplets under @xmath0 . in an assignment inspired by  flipped @xmath18 \" models @xcite , the @xmath19 of @xmath18 contains a lepton doublet and up - type antiquarks , the @xmath20 a quark doublet , down - type antiquarks and a neutrino , and the @xmath18 singlet is a positively - charged lepton ( positron etc . ) , and similarly for the katoptrons in @xmath21 .    the symmetry @xmath22 is assumed to break at energies @xmath23 down to the standard model ( sm ) group times an abelian @xmath24 felt only by katoptrons .",
    "one is then left with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the hypercharge group with a rescaled coupling .",
    "the fields leading to this breaking are neglected in the 1-loop calculation of coupling renormalization below .",
    "while katoptrons interact with the same @xmath27 interaction as known fermions at energies below @xmath23 , they carry their own @xmath24 interaction down to the ew symmetry scale .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 becomes strong near @xmath28 , breaking itself and the ew symmetry @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of the gauge couplings @xmath29 at energy scales @xmath30 for @xmath31 fermions in the fundamental representation ( rep ) of @xmath32 at 1-loop is given by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 some reference scale , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the katoptron coupling @xmath37 evolves at scales ranging from @xmath38 to the unification scale @xmath8 according to @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 coupling @xmath41 and the @xmath42 coupling @xmath43 evolve according to @xmath44 at energies where both ordinary and katoptron fermions contribute to the beta functions , _",
    "i.e. _ between @xmath38 and @xmath23 . either below @xmath28 , where katoptrons are massive and decouple , or when fermions and katoptrons interact with distinct groups , as is the case for all the @xmath45 and the @xmath18 , @xmath21 couplings , couplings evolve according to @xmath46 , with @xmath47 for the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 couplings of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 respectively , and @xmath56 for the @xmath57 couplings and the @xmath58 , @xmath59 couplings of @xmath18 , @xmath21 respectively . the relevant boundary conditions , noting that @xmath60 @xmath61 and @xmath62 gev , are : @xmath63    these relations yield @xmath8 , @xmath23 , and @xmath38 , assuming a `` big desert '' between these scales and decoupling of the heavier degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath64    and using the boundary conditions listed above , we find @xmath65 where @xmath66 due to @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , we find @xmath68 and @xmath69 . a dynamical justification of the value of the unification coupling is attempted in the next section . moreover",
    ", one observes that @xmath70    a relation rendering transparent the dynamical solution of the hierarchy problem due to katoptrons .",
    "the value of a single parameter remains then to be justified more fundamentally , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath71 , if a relation of the form @xmath72 can be produced from the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath23 renders this scenario safe , at first glance , with regards to proton decay .",
    "it has to be emphasized that if katoptrons kept interacting with the same hypercharge interaction as ordinary fermions , coupling unification would be impossible due to the faster running of the @xmath54 coupling , as is obvious by the slopes of figure 1 .",
    "this problem was obviated in @xcite by the appearance of a relatively low scale of pati - salam symmetry breaking , something not possible here .",
    "in addition , inspection of figure 1 shows that had katoptrons kept their own distinct @xmath73 and @xmath74 interactions , coupling unification would require an ew symmetry breaking scale @xmath38 that would be too low .",
    "furthermore , in such a case the scale @xmath23 would be too low to avoid an observable proton - decay rate .",
    "on the other hand , adding artificially additional matter in the present theory to slow down the running of the @xmath42 and @xmath40 couplings to enable them to unify with an hypothetical common @xmath75 coupling would require @xmath38 to be too high for ew symmetry breaking .",
    "the value of @xmath8 is close to @xmath76 ( see figure 1 ) , a result due to the slower running of some of the gauge couplings , since above @xmath28 both fermions and katoptrons contribute to the renormalization of the @xmath40 and @xmath42 couplings .",
    "this is also due to the use of the @xmath77 group and its primed partner .",
    "it is not expected that these results change significantly by higher - order calculations or by including contributions of the fields responsible for symmetry breaking .",
    "next , the symmetry breaking chain from a group @xmath7 down to @xmath9 and then down to the sm is explored using @xcite .",
    "non - zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of effective composite fields are taken to lead to the breaking channels needed .",
    "these are fermion condensates arising non - perturbatively to safeguard gauge invariance at tree level .",
    "coupling unification forces us to keep a distinct @xmath24 for katoptrons breaking at @xmath38 in a way consistent with ew radiative corrections .",
    "therefore , apart from fermion condensates of the form @xmath78 , gauge - invariant 4-fermion condensates @xmath79 are assumed to break the two hypercharge symmetries down to their diagonal subgroup @xmath80 and then together with @xmath40 down to @xmath81 near the weak scale .",
    "such operators arise again non - perturbatively and are also needed to  feed \" mass to fermions @xcite .    in order to have one generation of fermions in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath18 , in addition to the right - handed neutrino , needed for the sm particles to fit inside @xmath82 in an anomaly - free way ( and similarly for katoptrons in @xmath83 ) , we assign fermions in @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "one generation of fermions fits inside 2 copies of @xmath85 and 1 copy of @xmath86 .",
    "a @xmath19 pairs up with a @xmath87 under @xmath18 acquiring thus gut - scale masses .",
    "we are thus left with @xmath88 under @xmath89 , i.e. a full fermion generation , plus a neutral lepton for each generation , and similarly for katoptrons . assuming that effective fields in the * 35 * of @xmath82 and @xmath83 acquire non - zero vevs at @xmath8 , @xmath90 breaks down to @xmath91 .",
    "note that this is not the only possible breaking channel for each @xmath82 left invariant by * 35 * , @xmath92 and @xmath93 being other examples .",
    "these are however phenomenologically unacceptable , since in these cases quarks would not carry @xmath94 charges .",
    "therefore , it has to be proven that the `` flipped '' @xmath18 is the preferred symmetry - breaking channel .    with regards to the breaking of @xmath95 down to @xmath96 at @xmath23 , we use the fact that the @xmath97 of @xmath82 contains a @xmath98 under @xmath89 ( and similarly for the primed groups ) . assuming that fermion composite operators with quantum numbers @xmath99 and @xmath100 under @xmath101 acquire non - zero vevs near @xmath23 , they break the two @xmath18 symmetries down to their @xmath102 subgroups , while @xmath52 , @xmath103 are left intact . in order to break the two resulting @xmath102 symmetries down to their diagonal subgroup , since fermions and katoptrons interact with the same @xmath42 and @xmath40 interactions ,",
    "it is necessary to couple somehow the -initially decoupled- left - handed and right - handed sectors of the theory in a way that the two @xmath18 groups break down to their diagonal subgroup . in the following ,",
    "we assume that this coupling takes place , noting that a possible solution to this problem can be better justified within the context of the next subsection where it is presented .    further breaking to",
    "the sm takes place by additional effective fields transforming as a @xmath104 of @xmath82 , and similarly for @xmath83 , which decomposes under @xmath17 like @xmath105 .",
    "near the @xmath101 breaking scale @xmath23 , these fields are taken to acquire non - zero vevs and also break @xmath106 down to @xmath107 , mixing their @xmath52 , @xmath53 charges with the charges of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 groups in the final hypercharge groups @xmath54 , @xmath24 .",
    "we will see shortly how the effective fields @xmath104 and @xmath97 in each of @xmath82 and @xmath83 might emerge naturally in this theory .",
    "moreover , one has to demonstrate that the alternative breakings of @xmath18 to @xmath110 , and similarly for their primed partners , is disfavoured .",
    "the reason why alternative embeddings of the @xmath89 groups into @xmath111 or a pati - salam symmetry for instance are not considered will become clear in the following .",
    "our next goal is to expand the larger symmetry @xmath112 at the energy scale @xmath8 further .",
    "apart from being responsible for the dynamical ew symmetry breaking , @xmath1 plays the role of a gauged generation group for katoptrons .",
    "in addition , it prohibits gauge invariant vector - like masses corresponding to fermion bilinear operators formed by combining the known fermions with katoptrons .",
    "even though it would be nice to have a generation gauge symmetry for the known fermions as well , this is excluded by phenomenological reasons , i.e. by the absence of flavour - changing neutral currents .",
    "it is however reasonable to assume , for naturalness and symmetry reasons , that such a generation symmetry @xmath113 existed at higher energies only to be broken at lower energies .",
    "an initial symmetry group of the form @xmath114 would nonetheless have rank 14 . in principle",
    ", such a symmetry may be embedded within a larger symmetry to allow for unification .    for that purpose",
    ", we consider @xmath115 .",
    "known fermions fit in @xmath116 embedded in @xmath117 , while katoptrons fit in @xmath118 embedded in @xmath119 .",
    "fermions sit in the @xmath120 reps of the two @xmath121s , and the ones in the @xmath5 exhibit the opposite chirality from the ones in @xmath4 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath113 breaks at @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath122 and @xmath123 of @xmath124 transform under @xmath125 like @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "if fermions initially sit in these reps , vector - like particles contained in @xmath128 and @xmath129 obtain gut - scale masses .",
    "we then need 2 copies of fermions in the @xmath122 of @xmath124 to give us the 2 @xmath130s , and 1 copy in the @xmath123 of @xmath124 containing the @xmath131 of @xmath82 described above .",
    "this content , replicated thrice , corresponds to the fermion generations .",
    "similar considerations apply for the primed groups corresponding to katoptrons .",
    "we discuss later fermions transforming under the conjugate @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "how do @xmath124 and @xmath134 break down to @xmath116 and @xmath118 ?",
    "the * 133 * of @xmath124 contains the @xmath135 of @xmath125 which is needed for the breaking of @xmath136 down to @xmath137 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath122 of @xmath124 , when decomposed under @xmath125 , contains the @xmath138 needed for the breaking of @xmath139 down to @xmath140 .",
    "considering non - zero vevs of effective fields in the @xmath122 and @xmath123 of @xmath124 and @xmath134 may lead to the breaking sequence needed , since not only do these break @xmath124 , @xmath141 , but they also contain the @xmath138 and @xmath135 fields for the breaking of the symmetries to the sm .",
    "the embedding of @xmath142 in @xmath143 is now straightforward , with left - handed and right - handed fermions initially contained in the fundamental reps of @xmath121 and @xmath5 respectively . noting that @xmath144 , and that the @xmath120 of @xmath4 decomposes under @xmath145 like @xmath146 , we find 2 copies of fermions in the @xmath122 and 1 copy of the @xmath123 in each of the @xmath4 and @xmath147 , assuming that the extra @xmath148 , @xmath149 symmetries in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are also broken .",
    "regarding the breaking of @xmath4 and @xmath147 down to @xmath150 and its primed copy , the symmetric tensor product of 2 fundamental reps of @xmath121 yields @xmath151 .",
    "in fact , @xmath145 is the only symmetric subgroup of @xmath4 , denoted sometimes in this context as @xmath152 , left invariant by * 3875*. if fields , like fermion bilinears , having such quantum numbers acquired non - zero vevs , they could provide us with the desired symmetry - breaking channel for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , assuming that breaking to a symmetric subgroup is preferred over other channels . moreover , the * 3875 * of @xmath4 contains the @xmath122 and @xmath123 effective fields under @xmath153 that could lead to the symmetry breaking channels exposed above .",
    "the @xmath154 leaves @xmath145 invariant , but it is quite large , and it being formed is hard to justify by mac arguments .",
    "the @xmath120 contains the * 56 * and * 133 * of @xmath153 as well , and the corresponding channel is also attractive @xcite , so having a non - zero vev of an effective field in this rep might also suit our purposes and be ultimately responsible for the breaking chain described . since adding fundamental scalars is avoided , a candidate for this field is formed by an antisymmetric tensor product of two fermions in @xmath120 , i.e. @xmath155 , where the subscript @xmath156 refers to its antisymmetric nature .",
    "this field however is not a lorentz scalar , a fact used later in this work .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that the breaking channel above is more attractive than alternative ones leading from @xmath121 down to @xmath157 or @xmath158 .",
    "next , we inquire how the generation symmetry of the ordinary fermions @xmath113 breaks .",
    "we relax one of our assumptions and take the coupling @xmath159 of @xmath124 to be much larger at @xmath8 than the coupling @xmath160 of @xmath134 , something lying at the heart of parity asymmetry .",
    "the large value of @xmath161 is assumed to trigger the self - breaking of @xmath113 down to @xmath162 , via a non - zero fermion bilinear vev transforming under the @xmath163 of @xmath113 originating from @xmath164 .",
    "this is further broken down to @xmath165 with a vev transforming under the adjoint of @xmath162 coming from @xmath166 , assuming that the singlet of this channel does not determine the correct vacuum . the remaining @xmath165 breaks when the fundamental reps of @xmath82 pair up with each other , with the @xmath167 of * 133 * pairing up with the @xmath130 of * 56 * of @xmath124 .",
    "this scenario is in principle consistent with the self - breaking of the mirror - fermion generation symmetry @xmath1 at @xmath168 tev , since both symmetries self - break when their gauge couplings become strong @xcite .",
    "to assure that this does not create problems with coupling unification , we use the relation @xmath169 holding for the ( @xmath58 , @xmath170 ) and ( @xmath48 , @xmath171 ) couplings due to the breaking of their respective gauge groups at @xmath23 down to their diagonal subgroups , since @xmath172 .",
    "all fermions at @xmath23 are then left with common abelian and non - abelian couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ the weakest ones . to sum up , denoting as @xmath173 the symmetry @xmath174 , we assume that the following symmetry breaking chain is obtained , triggered by the @xmath175 condensate and starting from @xmath176 : @xmath177~ ( \\rm{at } ~ \\lambda_{gut } ) \\rightarrow & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "further dynamical justification of the breaking chain above follows in the next section .",
    "next , we address the appearance of conjugate generations in the considerations above .",
    "these are sometimes referred to as `` mirror families '' , and would in principle appear within each of the @xmath179 , @xmath5 . however , we assume that `` mirror fermions '' are just coming from a second @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath147 . what happens to the conjugate generations within each of the @xmath180 , @xmath5 ?",
    "this issue first appeared when we stepped from @xmath82 to @xmath124 .",
    "if these conjugate generations were the `` mirror partners '' of the rest of the fermions , i.e. related to each other via a parity transformation interchanging their chirality , they would probably pair up with them , acquiring unification - scale gauge - invariant vector - like masses and disappearing from the low energy spectrum .",
    "if there were a symmetry reason why this is forbidden , they would anyway never have masses much above 1 tev , since in that case they would raise the weak scale at unacceptable levels .",
    "but even in that case , they would either share a gauged generation symmetry with the known fermions , something which is experimentally excluded , or not have such a gauge symmetry , in which case our dynamical symmetry breaking scenario involving strongly - interacting mirror fermions would break down .",
    "we must therefore dispense of the conjugate copies within each of the @xmath179 , @xmath147 in a consistent manner .",
    "this problem was circumvented in @xcite by introducing extra dimensions , since in 10 dimensions one may define majorana - weyl spinors and impose a chirality condition , identifying thus the two kinds of fermion generations . in the present 4-dimensional approach",
    "however this trick is inapplicable .",
    "the answer lies within the channel the groups @xmath4 and @xmath5 break @xcite .",
    "the group @xmath121 has just 2 symmetric subgroups , @xmath181 and @xmath145 .",
    "charge conjugation and parity transformations on fermion reps in each of these subgroups are distinct , flipping the sign of a different number of @xmath4 roots . when embedding @xmath181 in @xmath4 , charge conjugation @xmath182 amounts to complex conjugation , i.e. for a fermion rep @xmath183 in @xmath184 for instance , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , the bar denoting complex conjugation , while parity transformation @xmath187 changes chirality with no complex conjugation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath188 and @xmath189 . consequently , @xmath190 transformations taking particles to their antiparticles are distinct from parity transformations . on the contrary , in the embedding of @xmath191 in @xmath4 ,",
    "charge conjugation @xmath192 leaves the fermion rep invariant , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath193 and @xmath194 , while a parity transformation @xmath195 implies not only chirality change but charge conjugation as well , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath196 and @xmath197 , so that @xmath198 .",
    "parity and @xmath199 transformations have an identical effect in the @xmath145 case .",
    "consequently , conjugate families appearing in @xmath124 and @xmath4 here are taken to be the antiparticles of fermions , not their `` mirror partners '' .",
    "the fact that these are not observed in nature characterizes the  baryon asymmetry of the universe \" and is a distinct problem from the one of",
    " mirror \" fermions .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular symmetry - breaking channel is now clear , since a breaking involving @xmath200 leading to a pati - salam ( ps ) scenario creates problems with conjugate generations .",
    "an alternative ps scenario could in principle still be recovered via a channel involving @xmath124 and @xmath201 @xcite , but it leaves no room for the symmetry @xmath173 , which is central to the discussion below .",
    "to proceed , we argue that @xmath202 contains the lorentz symmetry @xmath203 ( up to discrete subgroups omitted here for the sake of simplicity ) , an assumption motivated by the proximity of @xmath8 to @xmath76 . with regards to the non - compact nature of the lorentz symmetry ,",
    "note that we are dealing with the complexified versions @xmath204 of the corresponding groups .",
    "therefore , to be more explicit , one should write the @xmath121 decomposition above as @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "one then gets from the two @xmath121s the group @xmath206 ( since @xmath207 ) which has both @xmath208 and @xmath203 as subgroups . a relevant mechanism",
    "should obviously be provided in order to lead to the relevant symmetry breaking and to the observed signature in nature , which is discussed later .",
    "the @xmath173 group is therefore assumed to contain the lorentz group and it is taken to be a global , not a local symmetry .",
    "we list some arguments supporting this assumption .",
    "first , spin-1 gauge bosons associated with a gauged @xmath173 are neither observed nor expected .",
    "second , there are no prohibitive phenomenological constraints enforcing a local lorentz symmetry @xcite .",
    "third , taking lorentz symmetry to be a global symmetry spontaneously broken allows the identification of some of the corresponding goldstone bosons with the usual gravitons @xcite@xcite .",
    "fourth , considering @xmath173 as an unbroken symmetry would not allow the pairing of the fermions sitting in the @xmath167 and @xmath130 of @xmath82 needed to obtain the required fermion content .",
    "last , breaking the lorentz symmetry via an antisymmetric fermion tensor product transforming like @xmath175 under @xmath4 is needed in order to obtain the symmetry - breaking channel to the sm , as described below . in order to render the relation between @xmath173 and the lorentz group consistent",
    ", one needs to equate the @xmath203 coupling with the gravitational coupling . for coupling unification to work , one should extend the previous parity - breaking relation @xmath172 from the two @xmath153 to the two @xmath121 groups .",
    "after the breaking of @xmath209 down to the lorentz group , @xmath203 should be left with the @xmath210 coupling of @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ the weakest one .    before continuing ,",
    "we need to address the coleman - mandula theorem prohibiting the total symmetry from being a direct product of a local lorentz group with a gauged symmetry @xcite . we choose to follow @xcite , claiming that our starting point is a topological symmetric phase , in which the metric is initially absent and no s matrix",

    ", these vevs have a dynamical origin since they are expressed as fermion bilinear operators : @xmath220    where @xmath221 are dirac matrices in d dimensions and @xmath222 are grassmann variables in the irreducible spinor rep of the @xmath214-dimensional lorentz group .",
    "a relevant partition function , effective action and effective potential can then be formally defined , a prerequisite being an anomaly - free functional measure @xmath223 preserving lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "this is expected to lead in principle , in lowest order in the effective potential expansion , to equations similar to the ones of general relativity @xcite , in a way that spacetime is not treated as background but is incorporated in the equations non - perturbatively . in such a picture ,",
    "physical distances are induced by fermion correlation functions and the appearance of a metric is inherently quantum - mechanical .",
    "difficulties in quantizing gravity would show up in possible gravitational anomalies and in regularizing the corresponding effective potential .",
    "although the finite number of counterterms in this context is encouraging for renormalizability , we do not pursue further the highly non - trivial issues arising in this setting .",
    "the approaches quoted above use large orthogonal groups in which the embedding of the lorentz group takes place , treating lorentz and gauge transformations in a unified manner as rotations in a higher - dimensional space ( 14 total dimensions in @xcite corresponding to @xmath224 , 16 total dimensions in @xcite corresponding to @xmath181 ) .",
    "the interpretation of these extra dimensions differs slightly in the two approaches . in @xcite ,",
    "gauge symmetry arises by compactification of extra space dimensions .",
    "therefore , in a complete approach we have to replace ordinary derivatives by covariant ones in the quantities appearing in the four - dimensional @xmath225 , while this is not necessary for the higher - dimensional @xmath226 .",
    "on the other hand , extra dimensions in @xcite are considered as internal dimensions corresponding to a unifying orthogonal group .",

    "this correspondence is realized when spacetime derivatives in 4d appearing in @xcite are replaced by gauge covariant derivatives , and fermion bilinears are treated as effective fields .",
    "the problem with large orthogonal groups however , as we saw above , is the emergence of conjugate generations which can not be considered as anti - generations , but are just mirror copies of ordinary fermions . to solve this problem and make connection with our model , we extend the unification symmetry to @xmath227 , adopting the fermion - bilinear approach for the soldering forms @xcite in order to maintain the dynamical interpretation of the breaking of @xmath228 , where internal dimensions are connected with the appearance of gauge symmetries in 4d .",

    "such lattices exist only in @xmath304 dimensions .",
    "when @xmath281 , the only such lattices are @xmath303 and @xmath305 .",
    "note that the same space has already been used in the context of heterotic string theory , the crucial difference being the origin of the quantization condition ; instead of considering strings on a continuous background , the idea here is to work on a discrete space from the start .",
    "after symmetry breaking , @xmath173 should carry traces of this discrete structure , while taking the root norm to be of size @xmath283 is expected to approximate satisfactorily the continuum at low energies . more work",
    "is obviously needed in order to check rigorously the validity of this construction , which will be quite useful in the next section .    in the following",
    ", an effort is made to motivate further our choice of @xmath227 as a unification symmetry group , apart from the self - duality feature which might prove to be unique and crucial for unifying spacetime with gauge symmetries .",
    "the arguments presented below might reduce the arbitrary nature of such a choice .",
    "the appearance of this symmetry might be due to a relevant phase transition in a discrete space and might be related to the fact that each of the two 8d @xmath4 lattices , which are also even and self - dual , offer the densest sphere - packing and correspond to the highest  kissing number \" configuration known in 8d .",
    "this property allows by the way their use in other scientific areas like coding theory , since they offer the most efficient information transmission @xcite . to use this result in the present context however ,",
    "the 8d spaces of the two @xmath4 groups have to be treated distinctly , something consistent with the parity violating assumption @xmath306 made previously , since couplings emerge from the volumes vol@xmath307 of the compactified dimensions and are inversely proportional to them . taking the @xmath179 , @xmath147 to be localized on distinct 8d hypersurfaces ( hyps ) and the compactification radius corresponding to @xmath121 to be much smaller than the one of @xmath5 , i.e. vol@xmath308 hyps@xmath309 vol@xmath310 hyps@xmath311 , could possibly give a geometrical interpretation of parity - symmetry breaking . treating the two @xmath4s distinctly from this particular viewpoint is anyway required , since , while each of the two @xmath4 lattices provide the highest kissing number and densest sphere packing in 8d , in 16d other lattices like the barnes - wall ( bw ) lattice provide a higher kissing number and denser sphere packing than @xmath303 , even though they are not self - dual . in particular , the @xmath303 kissing number equals 480 , while the bw lattice has a kissing number equal to 4,320 .",
    "however , since lattices like bw do not correspond to any root system , they can not generate the symmetries needed .",
    "it is very important to note that densest sphere packings in higher dimensions @xmath312 are most likely either disordered , not corresponding to lattices , or the lattices they correspond to are not associated with root systems and thus known gauge symmetries .",
    "the disordered packing phenomenon appears already when @xmath313 and it is due to the fact that the packing density @xmath314 , defined as the ratio of volume of one sphere to the volume of the corresponding lattice s fundamental cell , is falling exponentially with @xmath214 .",
    "the @xmath4 lattice @xmath315 for instance provides a packing density of only @xmath316 in eight dimensions , while in three dimensions , the highest sphere packing density , in an arrangement correctly conjectured by kepler and being part of hilbert s 18th problem , reaches around @xmath317 .",
    "however , even when such higher - dimensional densest sphere packings correspond to lattices , like the  leech \" lattice in 24d , these do not correspond directly to a lie group s root system .",
    "therefore , all other cases for @xmath312 can not easily lead to the symmetries needed for phenomenology and unification considerations .    an additional argument supporting this scenario",
    "is related to the concept of optimal lattices . in order for @xmath303 to arise naturally , it could be shown that it either extremizes an effective  potential \" between lattice points , or equivalently that nature is based on a new fundamental principle reformulating the  least - action \" principle , requiring  most efficient information transmission \" for each of the 2 lattices of the @xmath4 groups , justifying thus their choice as the vacuum of our world .",
    "this lattice would then have to be universally optimal , independently of the specific form of the  potential \" used , apart from general requirements of being repulsive at short- and attractive at long distances .",
    "note that universal optimality of this lattice has already been investigated and is true for potentials , as functions of the distance between the centres of the spheres located at the origin of the roots , which are decreasing monotonically fast enough @xcite .",
    "repulsion at short distances amounts to the impossibility of having 2 lattice sites occupying the same position , which is equivalent to pauli s exclusion principle",
    ". attraction at large distances leading to the formation of this lattice is achievable _ via _ dynamics favouring long - range order .",
    "alternative justification for the number of internal dimensions ( 14 here ) as multiple of seven might come from arguments based again on densest sphere packing and involving optimal vacuum energy density @xcite . in any case , all these arguments might be an indication that we are approaching a theory starting from an action as simple as the one in equation [ action ] and yielding the dimension of the internal space and its isometries by the dynamics of the action itself , without having to postulate them _ a priori_. this is similar in spirit with emergent geometry and gravity @xcite , although it seems more general since it tries to include all the gauge symmetries as well .",
    "the next section deals with this issue in more detail , trying to crystallize these thoughts in a more concrete way .",
    "in order to connect our action to the results above , one needs first to justify the value of @xmath71 calculated in section 2 .",
    "we are dealing with a critical phenomenon breaking @xmath2 and having as order parameters the non - zero vevs in equations [ orderparam1 ] and [ orderparam ] .",
    "the relevant critical parameters are the couplings of the two @xmath4s .",
    "the order parameters are assumed here to scale as @xmath318 with fermions @xmath319 in the fundamental reps of @xmath121 and @xmath5 and @xmath320 .",
    "the @xmath321 condensate , corresponding to the mac , is assumed here to be the catalyst for the formation of the antisymmetric condensates in the @xmath175 of the two @xmath121s .",
    "similarly , it is taken to be the catalyst for the formation of the 4-fermion operators discussed in section 2 .",
    "this should obviate problems arising from the fact that the antisymmetric channel is by itself not as attractive as the singlet one .",
    "this implies that the values of the critical couplings for the formation of such vevs are at least close to each other .",
    "we return to this issue in the next subsection .",
    "since @xmath280 breaks at around @xmath76 , we first estimate this coupling by using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) formalism , which in 4d gives @xmath322    with fermion mass @xmath218 and an effective coupling @xmath323 given by @xmath324    and having a critical value @xmath325 ( see for instance @xcite ) . assuming that @xmath323 is determined by the value @xmath326 of the gauge coupling at the symmetry breaking scale",
    ", we find @xmath327 with @xmath328 the quadratic casimir invariant of @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "a value @xmath329 yields @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "although this number is small due to the magnitude of @xmath332 , it is larger than @xmath333 found in section 2 .",
    "in fact , @xmath71 is close to its critical value @xcite in the case of unbroken @xmath121 gauge symmetries .",
    "this may be due to the fact that gravitational interactions stemming from @xmath334 are associated with massless goldstone bosons identified with gravitons , and are also connected to @xmath335 which have infinite correlation length .",
    "this implies a graviton propagator whose scalar part for small momenta @xmath336 scales as @xmath337 @xcite .",
    "since in a unified setting the gravitational constant scales as @xmath338 , neglecting this infrared ( ir ) behaviour amounts to neglecting the masslessness of gravitons .",
    "the enhanced contribution to the condensate integral stemming from the ir region might be responsible for the smaller critical value of @xmath323 .",
    "although a full calculation requires a complete quantum theory of gravity , we attempt to estimate roughly this critical coupling by replacing @xmath339 above with a gauge - boson propagator @xmath340 , @xmath336 being the external momentum .",
    "after angular integration this expression is replaced by @xmath341 .",
    "taking @xmath218 and @xmath323 to be momentum - independent , we have @xmath342    yielding @xmath343 , where @xmath344 .",

    "the regime @xmath346 is then equivalent to @xmath347 , in which case @xmath323 is given by the same expression as in equation [ njl2 ] , so @xmath325 .",
    "for @xmath348 however , @xmath349 .",
    "taking @xmath350 as before , we have @xmath351 .",
    "then , we find @xmath352 , allowing thus a dynamical interpretation of @xmath71 found in the previous section .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath353 .",
    "criticality is not apparent for @xmath354 and @xmath350 , but @xmath355 is close to @xmath356 predicted for self - energies @xmath357 in unbroken gauge theories @xcite . with regards to equation [ hierarchy ] , the wide hierarchy between @xmath76 and the weak scale",
    "can then be traced back to the magnitude of @xmath332 , since @xmath358 the coupling in higher dimensions being inversely proportional to vol@xmath359 , a shrinking compactification space until the above equation is satisfied might provide a relevant geometrical interpretation .",
    "as promised in the previous section , we now take a first glance at the dynamics which might lead to the emergence of symmetry in the first place by studying a relevant phase transition . deferring rigorous justification of this approach to a more detailed future study",
    ", we apply techniques borrowed from similar studies in solid - state physics , chemistry , biology and even sociology .",
    "the common starting ground is the emergence of particle configurations exhibiting spontaneous self - organization transitions in ordered structures and nucleation , like dna , neural networks or crystals , _",
    "i.e. _ processes characterized by  self - organised criticality \" @xcite .",

    "therefore , the self - duality property of the @xmath360 lattice mentioned previously might provide a further advantage of the scenario proposed here .",
    "first , we find the relevant universality class , allowing us to predict the qualitative behaviour of the system by studying a simpler model hamiltonian belonging to the same class .",
    "one crucial factor determining universality class is dimensionality , noting that 8 , the dimension of the @xmath121 lattice , is the upper critical dimension for several random physical systems , generic lattice trees and some polymer and percolation models @xcite , appearing to be critical also for transitions in glasses @xcite and allowing the application of mean - field theory results .",
    "we place our action on a lattice to see if its qualitative behaviour can be inferred by simpler or similar systems in lattice gauge theories or solid - state systems . the effective action @xmath361 stemming from equation [ effaction ] to lowest order , apart from the einstein - hilbert terms ,",

    "readers familiar with the q - state potts model recognize in this expression @xmath404 given by @xmath405 for @xmath381 .",
    "this has a highly non - trivial and far - reaching impact on the topology of the network of nodes .",
    "since for a network to have any sense we assume that @xmath406 , a lattice like the one of @xmath121 with @xmath376 contributes much more to the partition function than the conventional @xmath374 lattice having @xmath375 . at this point , it is important to realize that @xmath373 corresponds to the  kissing number \" discussed in the previous section .",
    "approaching @xmath404 therefore allows the possiblity of having a @xmath121 lattice emerge spontaneously from the dynamics .",
    "the relevance of densest - sphere packing and  highest kissing number \" arguments presented in the previous section is now apparent , since this particular lattice offers an optimal configuration with regards to @xmath373 and might be preferred over alternative arrangements not offering so many edges per node .",
    "note moreover that  crystal \" clusters with @xmath407 evolve even when @xmath408 .",
    "however , such clusters should lie within limited regions not contradicting big - bang nucleosynthesis .    at this critical point",
    "other lattices with even higher @xmath214 and @xmath373 could also form .",
    "these however do not lead to the symmetries observed in our world , as explained in the last section .",
    "this implies that we might be living within a metastable region , with other universe domains corresponding to different configurations of lattice points , devoid of the known interactions .",
    "this is consistent with ostwald s rule in polymorphic and allotropic crystallography , according to which the least stable polymorphs crystallize first , leading to transformations between closest phases with regards to free energy .",
    "we return to this issue shortly .    returning to the @xmath121 lattices now , near @xmath409",
    "one finds a free energy @xmath410 and an entropy @xmath411 , where @xmath412 has a combinatorial interpretation , expressing the number of classically distinct configurations depending on whether a pair of nodes is connected or not by an edge . since for @xmath413 just above @xmath404 one expects @xmath414 , while for @xmath415 just below @xmath404 we have @xmath416 , the entropy @xmath417 is discontinuous and the heat capacity @xmath418 is expected to diverge at @xmath419 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath419 we expect a latent heat , or enthalpy , equal to @xmath420 a more careful calculation of enthalpy might produce a smaller value for @xmath421 due to the action of the @xmath242 discrete symmetries discussed in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , another regime is @xmath422 , for which @xmath423 .",
    "this describes the ground state and has a clear intuitive interpretation favouring large clusters .",
    "zero entropy follows the 3rd law of thermodynamics .",
    "negative energy implies positive pressure and contraction",
    ". however , quantum corrections are here significant .",
    "the negative contribution stemming from cluster formation is nearly cancelled by the quantum mechanical ground - state energy , leading to roughly zero energy and pressure , and lattice points close to equilibrium .",
    "metastability of the two @xmath121 lattices is central to the argument presented and should be studied more thoroughly now . to proceed , recall that , in a sphere packing",
    ", the space @xmath424 can be geometrically divided into identical regions @xmath10 called fundamental cells , each of which contains just one sphere .",
    "thus , the density of a sphere packing is given by @xmath425 , where @xmath426 is the volume of a single d - dimensional sphere and @xmath427 is the d - dimensional volume of @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "indeed , there exist bounds according to which the @xmath121 lattice offers a centre density higher than the maximum achievable for @xmath428 @xcite . in parallel ,",

    "as can also be seen in the related figure 2 , @xmath433 exhibits two , almost degenerate , minima at @xmath440 and @xmath430 . since a known kissing - number configuration does not necessarily saturate the packing - density upper bound , the calculation of @xmath433 above benefits suboptimal packings .",
    "this only makes our argument stronger , since the local extrema of the potential correspond to the @xmath121 and leech lattices , which are most likely optimal .",

    "moreover , one should study further the mechanism by which the two @xmath121 lattices couple to each other during the  crystallization \" and compactification process , in a way consistent with the discussion of the previous section .",
    "we close this section by noting that , in a space that is inherently discrete as the one just analysed , the continuum limit required in order to study consistently the @xmath121-singlet fermion condensate is ill - defined .",
    "therefore , the antisymmetric @xmath260 fermion condensate considered in the previous section is left as the most natural trigger of symmetry breaking .",
    "next , we describe some potentially interesting cosmological implications of this critical behaviour . we take the measured @xmath450 ev to correspond to the free energy of a minimal cluster of the @xmath451 lattice having 240 edges from each of the two @xmath121 s , _ i.e. _ @xmath452 , and @xmath453 ev of the cosmic background radiation to be equal to the system s temperature .",
    "then , the critical free - energy expression yields @xmath454 and @xmath455 .",
    "this implies a certain fine - tuning close to criticality for @xmath371 .",
    "taking the universe to be in a  glass - to - crystal \" transition , typical relaxation and equilibration times @xmath456 for glassy dynamics are huge compared to the microscopic ones of ferromagnetic - type systems .",

    "near the transition point , @xmath458 and @xmath456 diverge .",
    "this implies that relaxation times are of cosmological scale , and we might be just living within such a critical period .",
    "another issue to address is the smallness of @xmath254 in comparison to @xmath76 .",
    "the solution to this puzzle might be coming from the hamiltonian we started with , which includes only local , nearest - neighbour , interactions , effectively introducing a very large infrared cut - off . for this interpretation to work ,",
    "feynman integrals are to be performed over the whole momentum space only when particles are present in the feynman diagram , which can exhibit non - local behaviour .",
    "spacetime itself is local and momentum integration should not be allowed to reach values much lower than @xmath76 .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce a phenomenological potential @xmath460 between lattice sites being separated from each other by a distance @xmath461 , similar to the lennard - jones type , given by @xmath462    with @xmath463 , @xmath281 and @xmath156 having dimensions of length corresponding to the distance where  repulsive \" effects become important . for large @xmath461 , @xmath460 vanishes like @xmath464 , since the 2-point correlation function in position space falls as @xmath465 . using the fact that @xmath466 , min@xmath467 in accordance with the ground - state free energy reached for @xmath468 defining in parallel @xmath469 as a function of @xmath470 . the potential exhibits a non - linear behaviour with respect to @xmath470 , a situation possibly traceable back to the action of equation [ action ] before linearization .",
    "moreover , @xmath460 has a zero at @xmath471 , i.e close to the value where it has its minimum .",
    "since the slope of @xmath460 for small @xmath461 is proportional to a large power of @xmath156 , adjusting the modulus @xmath156 can control the steepness of the potential .",
    "using the relation @xmath472    derived directly from the minimization condition and taking @xmath473 gives the required hierarchy @xmath474 @xmath76 between @xmath254 and @xmath76 .",
    "the extent of this hierarchy might therefore be traced not only in the large dimensionality of our space , but also in the steepness of the repulsive potential between sites . moreover ,",
    "the quantity @xmath475 , apart from falling with increasing @xmath156 , is proportional to the system s vol@xmath307 and inversely proportional to the emergent gauge coupling .",
    "symmetry breaking could then be associated with a shrinking vol@xmath307 and with a critical value of the steepness parameter @xmath156 , _ i.e. _ @xmath476 , above which fermion condensates form .",
    "anyway , the form of the 2nd term of the potential needs further justification , probably in terms of a series expansion in powers of @xmath477 , where the value of @xmath156 might be determined by the geometry of the lattice .",
    "consequently , a higher - dimensional analogue of spin - glass phase transitions might provide a picture for the emergence of @xmath478 at the beginning of our universe , as a kind of  liquid - to - solid \" , freezing phase transition , or a kind of disorder - order ,  glass - to - crystal \" transition .",
    "regarding entropy @xmath399 , the only way for the system to compensate for the loss of @xmath399 within a spacetime volume @xmath396 during a time @xmath479 is to expand , changing its volume by @xmath480 .",

    "although large values for @xmath390 imply a period resembling inflation , a study in this direction exceeds the bounds of the present analysis .",
    "other cosmological implications include the existence of macroscopic domains in the universe not having the symmetries observed in our neighbourhood .",
    "particles within such regions would not interact in familiar ways , for instance not feeling electromagnetic interactions and possibly supplying an explanation for dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the luminous parts of galaxies would occupy regions corresponding to the  jammed \" , ordered phase of spacetime , domain states of ferromagnetic type , like  crystal bubbles \" within a glass - type , amorphous spacetime structure .",
    "domain growth would be described by a relation of the form @xmath482 .",

    "for @xmath488 , we find the following possible characteristic @xmath489 pairs : @xmath490 , @xmath491 and @xmath492 .",
    "a detailed analysis towards this direction would allow the prediction of galactic dm concentrations and of the average structure of the underlying spacetime lattice .",
    "it would allow answering questions like  is the structure of spacetime within the intergalactic voids of glass- or crystal - type ? \" and compare results with dm considerations @xcite .",
    "assuming that  crystal \" domains are occupied by visible galaxies implies that @xmath493 , while taking intergalactic voids to be also  crystal \"- like raises @xmath483 to around @xmath494 .",
    "other possibilities include dm regions corresponding either to alternative @xmath153 symmetry breakings , or to denser  sphere packings \" not linked to a group s root system .",
    "the latter takes us to a scenario where our vacuum has already started decaying towards a more stable configuration like the leech lattice , leading to growing dm and shrinking luminous domains .",
    "alternatively , in off - equilibrium phenomena of crystal and glass formation , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in fast transitions is violated , since the system does not have enough time to relax to its new equilibrium , forcing us to consider  effective temperatures \" @xmath495 even an order of magnitude larger from the heat - bath ones @xcite . here , @xmath496 implies @xmath497 , while @xmath498 implies @xmath499 . if the universe expanded and cooled too fast to have relaxed to equilibrium , @xmath495 for  crystal \" formation is larger than @xmath500 .",

    "this result favours in parallel the characterization of intergalactic voids as  crystal - like \" .",
    "note that the discrepancy between @xmath500 and @xmath495 might actually be smaller if a more careful calculation of the enthalpy @xmath421 is performed .",
    "moreover , the position of galaxies and such  crystal bubbles \" might be correlated , with mass acting as a topological defect closely connected to the formation of a spacetime  crystal \" .",
    "this has far - reaching implications on the structure formation of galaxies , consistent with the view that stars are born within dm halos .",
    "it could potentially lead to an understanding of the shape of spiral galaxies on the basis of  helicoidal dislocations \" in crystals .",
    "it might also explain the large voids between galactic clusters , since crystals usually displace impurities towards boundaries of different phases and form vacancy clusters to minimize their energy . in our case ,",
    "the role of impurities is played by dm regions containing small crystal  islands \" , _ i.e. _ galaxies .",
    "the latter are full of vacancy defects which are  frozen - in \" during cosmological expansion , in analogy to a similar phenomenon occuring during fast crystallization , and which correspond to elementary particles .",
    "such considerations might also solve the  dwarf galaxy \" problem , i.e. the rarity of  dwarf \" galaxies , which are an order of magnitude less than predicted by simulations @xcite@xcite , since in these  dwarf \" galaxies , particle density , seen as a defect , has not reached values consistent with nucleation and  crystal \" formation .",
    "experiments could be designed in the far future to probe the spacetime structure within dm domains , or to measure the potential energy release , perhaps in the form of ultra - high energy cosmic rays , which are presently of unknown origin , when the  crystal \" forms . however , critical phenomena of this kind are intractable even in low dimensions , necessitating the use of phenomenological potentials and simulations in the area of glass - to - crystal transitions which is still far from being well understood .",
    "although a thorough analysis in this direction transcends our purposes , the smallness of the luminous - matter portion of the total energy of the universe makes us reluctant to discard so radical solutions of the dm and dark - energy puzzle too hastily .",
    "we close this discussion by noting a similar attempt to circumvent problems cold - dm models have with galactic mass distribution by positing that dm is topological @xcite .",
    "next , we discuss briefly quantization of our action . what follows is speculative , noting a proximity of the present theory with some current approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "the fact that the group @xmath4 is simply laced allows the definition of a common scale @xmath283 equal to the roots norm , an identification defining a fundamental scale for the theory . by having @xmath508 emerge with lattice spacing equal to @xmath469 , one achieves a cellular decomposition of spacetime with a uv cut - off equal to @xmath76 , avoiding in principle singularities plaguing quantum gravity .",
    "the number of faces , edges and vertices of the various simplices is determined by this lattice .",
    "this might have a dramatic impact not only on the general renormalization programme but also on black holes , the initial singularity of spacetime and gravitational collapse , analogous for some to the false prediction of atom collapse before the advent of quantum mechanics .",
    "moreover , the metric in section 2 is reminiscent of the one in the spinorial version of ashtekar variables @xcite using no background metric . in an approach close to spin networks and lattice yang - mills",
    ", we have lattice nodes corresponding to 4d spacetime points , a  world crystal \" , where a continuum perturbative limit is ill - defined since spacetime is inherently discrete , while flat minkowski space lies far from perturbative considerations . on each node",
    "there is a fiber corresponding to @xmath235 stemming from 14 compactified dimensions .",
    "a probability wavefunction extending between 2 adjacent lattice nodes corresponds to a particle with planck - scale energy , which seems a reasonable configuration for the first moments after the creation of the universe .",
    "it also provides an understanding of heisenberg s uncertainty principle , since a particle is not localized on a node but extends at least between 2 adjacent nodes .",
    "this is compatible with treating particles with spin as spacetime defects like  dislocations \" and  disclinations \" in einstein - cartan action theories @xcite@xcite , reminds us of wheeler considering particles as ",
    "quantum geometrodynamic excitons \" @xcite in an analogy inspired by solid - state physics and is consistent with our previous treatment of particles as topological or vacancy defects .",
    "such schemes might also lead to a small @xmath254 due to a kind of  equilibrium \" between lattice sites @xcite .",
    "the above provide just a heuristic hint towards quantization , more work being required to derive robust results .",
    "experiments around @xmath76 should distinguish such a spacetime fabric from models treating particles as extended objects on a continuous spacetime background .",
    "ideas along these lines might include in the future a gravitational analogue of bragg spectroscopy probing the microstructure of spacetime .",
    "considering the results of the previous sections , we have to note that several open issues still remain . most important , the issue of reproducing reliably the equations of general relativity starting from an action of the form given in equation [ action ] and the issue of providing a solid framework leading to its quantization , while the emergence of a uv cutoff in the theory is an encouraging sign in this direction .",
    "next , one should show that the 16d torus over the @xmath509 lattice emerges naturally and produces the action needed to describe correctly physics at long wavelengths , including the number of internal dimensions , their possible relation to inflation , and the value of the cosmological constant . in this respect ,",
    "the metastability of this lattice should be studied further , since it would offer a solid argument for the emergence of the symmetries observed in nature .",
    "in addition , more work is required towards proving that the potts lattice model analyzed belongs to the same universality class as the one required by our spinor - gravity approach , in order to draw safer conclusions on the validity of the qualitative cosmological implications of this model , including the interpretation of elementary particles as vacancy defects , or  defectons \" in a quantum setting .",
    "then , a justification of the parity - violating assumption @xmath306 is needed , probably in relation with the compactification volumes .",
    "furthermore , a rigorous justification of the breaking channels of the symmetries down to the sm should be sought , since these channels , although attractive , are not unique . in addition , a more reliable calculation of the critical coupling associated to the breaking of the initial symmetry should be performed .",
    "moreover , unitarity issues have to be tackled because of the non - compact form of the lorentz group @xmath203 . in principle",
    ", a metric - independent topological action like the one in equation [ action ] should cure such issues when considered from the viewpoint of a fundamental theory .    on the experimental front",
    ", a problem with the fermion content described in this work is that it is usually associated with an @xmath399 parameter which is larger than what is measured experimentally .",
    "it remains to be seen whether non - perturbative vertex corrections in such models can drive the @xmath399 parameter close to zero , although so many new fermions are introduced @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "some lep and fermilab results at the @xmath510 level are in principle compatible with quark - katoptron mixing and the existence of katoptron bound states @xcite , since they suggest mass - dependent anomalous quark couplings @xcite and an excess of dijet plus w - boson events @xcite . moreover , assuming that the theory exposed above is correct , recent lhc results regarding a new boson having a mass of around 126 gev correspond to the lightest member of a series of katoptronic mesons , similar to qcd or technicolor mesons .",
    "this lightest meson , a ",
    "katoptronic pion \" corresponding to the lightest katoptrons , is expected to have comparatively very small couplings to third - generation ordinary fermions , like the bottom and top quark , due to the comparatively small mixing of the lightest katoptrons to third - generation ordinary fermions .",
    "we expect future collider experiments in lhc and elsewhere to shed more light on some of these issues by carefully studying the fermionic couplings of any new bosons detected .",
    "we exposed above an attempt to unify gauge with gravitational interactions using @xmath143 emerging naturally from first principles .",
    "it presents several advantages , not requiring many arbitrary parameters , nor fundamental scalar fields , nor extra space dimensions ; it leads to coupling unification and to an understanding of the unification coupling strength from an invariant of the emergent symmetry group ; it reproduces the symmetries , the family structure of matter and the dimensionality of spacetime , far from treating it as background ; it provides a possible solution to the hierarchy problem between the planck scale , the weak scale and the cosmological constant scale .",
    "moreover , it exhibits a unique vacua sequence with cosmological implications like the interpretation of dm as having a topological origin . securing the present approach on a firm basis needs , among many other things , a new physical principle which refers to  optimal connectivity \" .",
    "this principle lies presumably at the heart of several other scientific areas as well ( like crystallography , cognitive science etc . ) and is more fundamental than a given spacetime or gauge symmetry ; according to it , spacetime , matter , and their symmetries , emerge naturally , after a relevant phase transition , from a set of identical , distinct elementary fields connected to each other optimally .",
