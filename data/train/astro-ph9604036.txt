    "there is a tremendously rich literature on the distance determination of the virgo cluster ( e.g. de vaucouleur 1993 ) .",
    "relatively little has been worked on the fornax cluster of galaxies , although it offers several advantages with respect to the virgo cluster : it is more compact , does not show substructure , and is a spiral - poor , evolved galaxy cluster , where one can suspect that the elliptical galaxies projected near the center are indeed spatially concentrated .    in this letter , we apply the method of globular cluster luminosity functions ( gclfs ) to derive the distances of four ellipticals in the fornax cluster .",
    "the central point of this method , namely the universality of the turnover ( to ) magnitude is still a subject of some debate ( e.g. harris in jacoby et al .",
    "1993 , sandage & tammann 1995 , richtler 1995 ) .",
    "we show that among our target galaxies , the turnover magnitude scatters with a dispersion of 0.23 mag in v and only 0.14 mag in i , which indeed is evidence for a universal turnover .",
    "the full presentation of the data , together with a general presentation of the globular cluster system ( gcs ) will be given in a forthcoming paper , so here we restrict ourselves to some basic remarks .",
    "our targets were the galaxies ngc 1399 , 1374 , 1379 , 1387 , 1427 ( table [ observations ] ) .",
    "the observations have been performed with the 2.5 m dupont telescope at las campanas observatory , chile , in the period sept .",
    "26 - 29 , 1994 .",
    "the ccd was a tektronix chip with a pixel size of 0.227 , resulting in a frame with dimension @xmath0 .",
    "deep exposures have been gained in johnson v and cousins i. only ngc 1399 was covered by four overlapping frames , the other targets are much less extended and fit each on one frame .",
    "the seeing conditions were of medium quality , ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 .",
    "the limiting magnitude was approximately v=24 mag .",
    "modelling and subtraction of the target galaxies has been done with iraf routines , finding and photometry of point sources with daophot ii under iraf .",
    "the differences between psf and aperture photometry could be determined with an accuracy of better than 0.015 mag .",
    "the photometric calibration has also been done with iraf routines , using standard stars from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "about 30 standard star measurements were made nightly under photometric conditions .",
    "the mean residual of calibrated magnitude to standard star magnitude is about 0.02 mag for each night .",
    "obviously , a proper knowledge of the background population is essential for deriving a gclf , since we can not distinguish between point - like background sources and globular clusters . with the exception of ngc 1399 ,",
    "the gcss of the galaxies are considerably smaller in extent than the framesize so that the background could be determined locally .",
    "a coarse selection of gc candidates with respect to extended objects was done by selecting sources with psf profiles .",
    "the remaining background population consists mostly of distant galaxies , to some extend also of foreground stars . leaving details for a forthcoming full data presentation",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ background ] for v the relative contribution of the total counts , the background , and the subtracted counts in dependence on magnitude .",
    "the dashed line shows in addition the completeness , calculated by artificial star experiments .",
