    "the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe was eventually determined at the electroweak phase transition @xcite . the most straightforward method to study",
    "this phase transition is to use resummed perturbation theory ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . in the low temperature higgs phase the perturbative approach",
    "is expected to work well , however , it is not able to describe the high temperature symmetric phase , which has serious infrared problems in perturbation theory . since the determination of thermodynamical quantities at the critical temperatures is based on the properties of both phases , non - perturbative techniques are necessary for a quantitative understanding of the phase transition .",
    "one very succesful possibility is construct an effective 3-dimensional theory by using dimensional reduction , which is a perturbative step .",
    "the non - perturbative study is carried out in this effective 3-dimensional model ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "analytical estimates are confirmed by numerical results and relative errors are believed to be at the percent level .",
    "another approach is to use 4-dimensional simulations .",
    "the complete lattice analysis of the standard model is not feasible due to the presence of chiral fermions , however , the infrared problems are connected only with the bosonic sector .",
    "these are the reasons why the problem is usually studied by simulating the su(2)-higgs model on 4-dimensional lattices , and perturbative steps are used to include the u(1 ) gauge group and the fermions .",
    "finite temperature simulations are carried out on lattices with volumes @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the temporal and spatial extensions of the lattice , respectively .",
    "the lattice spacing is basically fixed by the number of the lattice points in the temporal direction ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the critical temperature in physical units ) ; therefore huge lattices are needed to study the soft modes .",
    "this problem is particularly severe for higgs boson masses around the w mass , for which the phase transition is weak and typical correlation lengths are much larger than the lattice spacing . in this case",
    "asymmetric lattice spacings are used , in particular the spatial lattice unit is approximately four times larger than the temporal one @xcite .    despite the fact that the two approaches ( perturbative and lattice ) are systematic and well - defined , it is not easy to compare their predictions .",
    "the reason for this is that in lattice simulations the gauge coupling constant is determined from the static potential , whereas in perturbation theory the @xmath4 scheme is used .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to perform as perfect a comparison as possible , by determining the @xmath4 gauge coupling constants , which correspond to the different lattice results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the one - loop static potential of the su(2)-higgs model using the @xmath4 scheme in the feynman gauge .",
    "section 3 relates the continuum version of the lattice gauge coupling constant to the @xmath4 coupling . in section 4",
    "the detailed comparison of lattice and perturbative predictions are presented .",
    "section 5 summarizes our results .",
    "the one - loop static potential was calculated long ago in quantum chromodynamics @xcite , and even the full two - loop result was published recently @xcite .",
    "the calculation is based on the same principles and techniques in the case of the su(2)-higgs model .",
    "one calculates rectangular wilson loops of size @xmath5 .",
    "the logarithm divided by @xmath6 gives the potential at distance @xmath7 in the @xmath8 limit .",
    "our calculation was performed in the @xmath4 scheme and the feynman gauge but the result is gauge independent , as it should be for a physical observable .",
    "the relevant graphs are shown in fig .  1 . other graphs , giving vanishing contributions in the feynman gauge and are not shown in fig .  1 .",
    "solid lines represent the heavy quark ( antiquark ) propagator , while wavy lines the vector boson propagator . external heavy quark ( antiquark )",
    "propagators are not shown in the figure .",
    "the one - loop corrected vector boson propagator contains scalar and ghost contributions as well .",
    "the result can be conveniently given in momentum space .",
    "one obtains    @xmath9   \\right\\ } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 denotes the square of the three - momentum @xmath11 , @xmath12 the higgs mass and @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath14 is defined as    @xmath15    as it can be seen , our result does depend on the renormalization scale @xmath16 and it fully agrees with that of m.  laine @xcite .",
    "( [ mom_pot ] ) has to be fourier transformed into coordinate space .",
    "we applied the brute force method performing numerical integration . as a check",
    ", we compared our results with various pieces of the partly analytic calculation in @xcite for the derivative of the potential ( with respect to distance ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "our result is presented in figs .  2 and 3 , where the various parts of the one - loop correction to the potential are plotted .",
    "we define    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the one - loop mass correction .",
    "since @xmath19 is scale dependent , so is @xmath20 .",
    "a and b are functions of the distance @xmath7 and @xmath21 .",
    "we choose @xmath22gev .",
    "2 shows the dependence of @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the dimensionless distance @xmath25 for @xmath26 ( corresponding to the end point of the first order finite temperature phase transition @xcite ) , while fig .  3 shows the @xmath27 dependence for @xmath28",
    "since we wish to compare results of lattice simulations and continuum perturbation theory calculations , it is an essential point to define the su(2 ) gauge coupling in the same way in both cases .",
    "however , in continuum perturbation theory the @xmath30 running coupling constant at a given renormalization scale is more natural ( as used in eqs .",
    "( [ mom_pot],[pot ] ) , too ) , while in lattice simulations other definitions are applied .",
    "therefore we have to establish the relation between the coupling constants .",
    "the lattice definition of the coupling constant is given in @xcite .",
    "note that we are using the local version below .",
    "for the reader s",
    "convenience we recall this definition ( inspired by @xcite ) . +",
    "first rectangular wilson loops of size ( r , t ) are measured .",
    "extrapolating to large @xmath31 and dividing the logarithm by @xmath6 one gets the static potential in the @xmath32 limit as a function of r. the nonperturbative lattice static potential is fitted by a finite lattice version of the yukawa potential with four parameters ( for details cf .",
    "one of these parameters is the mass in the exponential of the yukawa potential , which is usually called the screening mass .",
    "the gauge coupling at distance @xmath7 is defined as the ratio of the discrete @xmath7 derivative of the lattice simulated nonperturbative potential and the discrete derivative of the tree - level lattice yukawa potential normalized by the square of the tree - level coupling and with the mass parameter @xmath33 identified with the screening mass . in practice @xmath34 is determined and is called the local renormalized gauge coupling constant on the lattice .",
    "the lattice results at various higgs masses are collected in table 1 .",
    "data are from @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite .",
    "to follow the above procedure in the case of the continuum perturbative determination of the renormalized gauge coupling , we performed a fit of the one - loop potential with a tree - level yukawa potential plus a constant term .",
    "the parameters of the fit are the coupling constant , the mass in the exponent ( perturbative `` screening mass '' @xmath35 ) and the constant .",
    "for the various values of higgs mass we performed the fit in the same @xmath7 range as used in the lattice studies and took the errors of the fitted function to be proportional to the errors of the potential obtained in lattice simulations .",
    "@xmath36 is then determined by taking the ratio of the derivatives with respect to @xmath7 of the one - loop potential and the tree - level potential normalized by the square of the tree - level coupling , i.e.  we have @xmath37 } { { \\displaystyle}\\frac{d}{dr } \\int \\frac{d^3 k}{(2\\pi)^3}\\frac{\\exp ( i{\\vec k}\\cdot { \\vec r } ) } { k^2 + m_{\\rm screen}^2 } } , \\ ] ] with @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) , @xmath39 , and @xmath35 obtained from the fit . since @xmath40 , for distances satisfying @xmath41 we can put eq .",
    "( [ g2_def ] ) into the form @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 are functions of @xmath27 and @xmath35 , their values are tabulated in table 2 for @xmath45gev .",
    ".[couplings ] various quantities calculated for values of @xmath27 used in lattice simulations . for",
    "more explanation see the text . as usual",
    "the numbers in the parentheses denote the errors in units of the last decimals .",
    "the errors of the different gauge couplings are dominated by the lattice simulation errors ( fourth row ) , therefore we did not indicate them in rows 6 and 7 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the quantity which has the smallest pull even for large higgs boson masses is @xmath46 .",
    "a quadratic fit was performed to this quantity as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the result is @xmath47    in @xcite the end point result for the four - dimensional su(2)-higgs model was perturbatively converted to the standard model . in this step the deviation between the two definitions of the gauge coupling ( @xmath48 and the one based on the static potential ) was neglected . the estimated uncertainty due to this simplification was included into the systematic error of the end point higgs mass .",
    "using the results of the present paper we can also refine the value of the standard model end point higgs mass .",
    "this is done by perturbatively taking into account fermions and the u(1 ) factor of the standard model ( for details see the fourth paper of @xcite ) .",
    "the improvement is established by precisely converting the lattice simulation renormalized gauge coupling of the su(2)-higgs model into the perturbative @xmath49 .",
    "the new value of the standard model end point higgs mass is @xmath50gev .",
    "this does not deviate much from the old value @xmath51gev of @xcite .",
    "however , the error is smaller , since the uncertainty arising from the gauge coupling definitions is eliminated .",
    "in this paper we presented the one - loop static potential in the su(2)-higgs model .",
    "this calculation is in agreement with @xcite . using the potential it was possible to connect the gauge coupling constant used in finite temperature field theory and in lattice simulations .",
    "as expected the numerical difference between the two conventions is not that large , it is within a few percent . with this connection",
    "we were able to perform a precise comparison between the predictions of perturbative and lattice approaches .",
    "we reanalyzed the existing lattice data and performed a continuum limit extrapolation whenever it was possible .",
    "the relationship between the two definitions of the gauge coupling constants turned out to be marginal , as the lattice data have errors , usually larger then this few percent .",
    "the only quantity which is measured so precisely that the definition of the gauge coupling constant is essential is the ratio of the critical temperature to the higgs boson mass .",
    "as it has been observed already for @xmath52 gev the perturbative value of @xmath3 is larger than in lattice simulations .",
    "this sort of discrepancy disappears for larger higgs boson masses . a plausible reason for this fact is the convergence of the high temperature expansion used in the perturbative approach . in two - loop perturbation theory",
    "one uses the high temperature expansion also up to second order , which might be inaccurate for the smallest higgs mass case with temperatures @xmath53 gev and higgs field expectation values @xmath54 gev . nevertheless , the observed differences are on the percent level and they do not affect the electroweak phase transition significantly . for small higgs boson masses ( 16 and 34 gev )",
    "we expect similar differences between lattice and perturbative predictions for other quatities ( the jump of the order parameter , the latent heat and the surface tension ) ; however , present lattice data have too large errors and the differences can not be seen yet .",
    "the most dramatic differences appear clearly as we get closer to the end point .",
    "the perturbative approach gives nonvanishing jump of the order parameter , nonvanishing latent heat and interface tension , while the lattice results suggest rapid decrease of these quantities and no phase transition beyond the end point .",
