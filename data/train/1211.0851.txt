    "these trends can be qualified by effectively one - component mean - field treatments as pioneered by flory and de gennes .",
    "@xcite here the system free energy @xmath1 in dependence of coil size @xmath2 is typically written as  @xcite @xmath3 where the first term is the elastic energy of an ideal chain with @xmath4 monomers and segment length @xmath5 , and the other terms account for mutual monomer interactions globally expressed by an virial expansion up to second order in density @xmath6 .",
    "the virial coefficients have to be considered as based on _ effective _ pair potentials because the ( co)solvent degrees of freedom have been integrated out . scaling law predictions from ( 1 )",

    "@xcite a particularly important example is the specific effect of cosolutes , such as ions , osmolytes , or denaturants on protein structure and stability .",
    "@xcite here , general polymer principles are typically employed as a starting point for the investigation of those cosolute effects .",
    "@xcite in this spirit , relatively simple thermosensitive polymers such as the poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) homopolymer often serve as a experimental peptide model .",

    "remarkably this reproduces the observation in the simulation profiles in fig .  4 , where we found a homogenous bulk - like density in the most swollen state of the coil .",
    "for the largest plotted @xmath169 where polymer compaction is very strong this correspondence between the minimum in @xmath142 and plateau @xmath143 is lost for whatever reason . for further increasing @xmath170 the cosolute density @xmath143 within",
    "the polymer further grows for all values of @xmath59 while the chain is collapsing again .",
    "thus , consistent with the simulations , chain collapse driven by highly attractive polymer - cosolute interactions leads to highly dense cosolute states inside the coil .",
    "the density of about 14 nm@xmath36 is about twice as high as in the simulation , cf .",
    "fig .  4 , but the flory prediction of one - order - of - magnitude increase inside the globule is qualitatively correct .     in dependence of cosolute bulk density @xmath101 from the two - component flory - like approach .",
    "data are for a fixed monomer - monomer attraction @xmath91 and varying monomer - cosolute attractions @xmath74 , 0.4 , and 1.0 .",
    "note that only the case @xmath168 exhibits nonmonotonic behavior.,width=264 ]    finally , we can use the flory - like approach to make predictions about the dependence of polymer size @xmath2 on the cosolute density reservoir ( or bulk ) density @xmath101 .",
    "the calculated @xmath171 is plotted in fig .  9 in dependence of cosolute bulk density @xmath101 for a fixed monomer - monomer attraction @xmath91 and varying monomer - cosolute attractions",
    "@xmath74 , 0.4 , and 1.0 .",
    "the density range covers typical denaturant concentration from 1 to 8 nm@xmath36 , that is , 1.7 to 13.3 mol / l . in the case",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath2 decreases monotonically with density .",
    "this is expected for a depletion - like collapse mechanism , where the effect grows with density .",
    "in contrast , in the case @xmath172 , @xmath2 _ increases _ monotonically with density .",
    "that indicates that the collapse effect due to highly attractive cosolute deteriorates with increasing cosolute density .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath168 , where swelling is found for weakly attractive cosolutes , the size behavior is _ nonmonotonic .",
    "_ this is interesting in the light of lcst measurements of poly(nipam ) and elastin - like peptides in hofmeister salts .",
    "@xcite nonmonotonic behavior of the lcst change with salt concentration was indeed observed only in the swelling scenarios .",
    "this happened for the salts nai and nascn which seem to feature weakly attractive interactions with nonpolar peptide groups .",
    "the coarse - grained computer simulations performed here and elsewhere  @xcite demonstrate polymer collapse to compact globular states at highly attractive cosolute conditions .",
    "the polymer response and relative swelling / collapse behavior is most pronounced for polymers in nearly ideal @xmath57-like solvent conditions . here",
    "the polymer can shrink or swell considerably , depending on polymer - monomer interaction strength . collapsed states for repulsive and strongly attractive cosolutes are physically different as in the latter state",
    "the polymer coil is rich in cosolutes .",
    "for the same polymer size the internal cosolute density can differ enormously between 1/2 to 1/3 of the bulk density ( repulsive cosolutes ) and 8 times the bulk density ( highly attractive case ) , respectively , signifying considerably different physical properties of the globule - cosolute system .",
    "the most swollen polymer state is characterized by a bulk like cosolute density inside the polymer coil .",
    "we further demonstrate that the transition to collapsed states in strongly attractive cosolutes can be rationalized by two independent theoretical and semi - analytical approaches .",
    "their implications are summarized in the following .    the effective one - component statistical mechanics model showed that for large polymer cosolute attraction bridging interactions ( leading to compact glued states ) are energetically favored over both depletion interaction ( favoring collapse by exclusion ) and repulsion by attraction situation ( leading to swelling ) .",
    "we have shown that a critical parameter to distinguish those scenarios is the ratio between interaction width and cosolute size @xmath173 . only if polymer - cosolute interactions are not too short - ranged swelling effects should be observable .",
    "this may be valid for hydrophobic or dispersion attractions . in simulations",
    "indeed urea swells purely hydrophobic polymers  @xcite or hydrophobic peptides .",
    "@xcite in hydrogen bonding systems , however , the attraction length is short @xmath174 or 1/5 and no swelling is possible .",
    "consistent with that view , urea compresses pnipam polymers which has been argued is due to h - bonding and crosslinking by bivalent binding as demonstrated by experiments .",
    "@xcite methylated urea did not swell pnipam , neither did urea swell elastin - like peptides .",
    "the two - component flory - de gennes mean - field model also predicts polymer collapse at strongly attractive cosolute conditions .",
    "the transition from swollen to collapsed state at a polymer - cosolute attraction energy of @xmath175 is in good agreement with our computer simulations and the effective one - component approach .",
    "in particular , the flory model confirmed that cosolute densities inside the coil can significantly differ between repulsive cosolutes and strongly attractive ones .",
    "it also reproduced the simulation finding that the polymer is most swollen if internal cosolute density exactly matches bulk density for nearly ideal cosolutes .",
    "thus , the structural nature of collapsed states can be qualitatively different while the polymeric state alone , on a first glance , may be similar .",
    "the flory approach also predicts a nonmonotonic dependence of swelling magnitude with cosolute density , which is observed for pnipam or elastin in nai and nascn .",
    "@xcite a more detailed investigation may shed more light on the reason why .",
    "we note that dense cosolutes in polymer coils may have strong impact on internal friction and viscosity of polymeric globules . consequently , the conformational kinetics of polymers maybe highly affected by explicit direct - binding cosolutes in contrast to isolated polymers .",
    "@xcite    our findings may have implications on the interpretation of denaturant action on proteins and the nature of denatured states .",
    "for instance , the structure of molten globular proteins denatured by high naclo@xmath0 ( sodium perchlorate ) is controversially discussed.@xcite considering our results and the experimentally known strong affinity of naclo@xmath0 to the protein backbone ,  @xcite the reason for the difficulties may be a large amount of bridging or crosslinking denaturant which probably strongly obscures the experimental characterization of structure and its classification ."
