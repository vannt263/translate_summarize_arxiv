    "possible existence of superheavy elements ( she ) with atomic masses @xmath22 and atomic numbers @xmath23 was already discussed in 1950 s @xcite . in 1960",
    "s , the development of new methods of calculation of the shell model corrections to the liquid drop model predicted a neutron - rich `` island of stability '' around the double magic @xmath24 or 126 , @xmath25 @xcite , with half - life of the nucleus @xmath26110 calculated as @xmath27 yr @xcite and @xmath28 yr @xcite .",
    "various recent calculations @xcite related to different macro - micro and microscopic models predict @xmath25 as the magic number of neutrons and @xmath29 or 126 as the proton magic number for spherical nuclei .    in experiments on the artificial synthesis of the she in fusion of ions with accelerators , more than one hundred different unstable isotopes with @xmath30",
    "were created @xcite , with half - lives from microseconds to hours ( for @xmath31db @xmath32 h @xcite ) .",
    "new isotopes with @xmath33 predominantly undergo a chain of @xmath2 decays followed by spontaneous fission ( sf ) @xcite .",
    "note that the she formed in fusion reaction @xcite are proton - rich ( or neutron - deficient ) , and the half - lives of she with number of neutrons near the magic number 184 are expected to be longer .",
    "while maybe only the edge of the `` island of stability '' is reached to - date in the laboratory conditions , long - lived she probably were produced in explosive stellar events by a sequence of rapid neutron captures and @xmath34 decays @xcite ( for current status of our understanding of she nucleosynthesis see e.g. @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . it should be noted that some recent estimations ( e.g. @xcite ) are more pessimistic : calculations @xcite predict that superheavy nuclei with masses up to @xmath35 can be produced during star explosions but they decay through several @xmath36 transformations and spontaneous fission on time scales of days not reaching the valley of stability .",
    "such results , however , evidently depend on models ( and many theoretical parameters ) used for description of stars , their evolution and nucleosynthesis during explosion , as well as on models which predict masses of nuclei and their half - lives respectively to @xmath2 , @xmath36 decays and spontaneous fission .",
    "thus , a possibility that long - lived she were synthesized in the r - process and that they still are present in minor quantities in the earth materials is not fully excluded .    in 1970",
    "s and 1980 s , an extensive program to search for she in nature was undertaken .",
    "hundreds of samples from the ocean floor to the lunar surface were analyzed with sensitivity to mass concentration of @xmath37 g / g ( see reviews @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "some hints were obtained on the presence of she through their fission in meteorites and in hot spring waters from the cheleken peninsula ( caspian sea ) , or through their long tracks in olivine crystals from meteorites ( which supposedly belong to she with @xmath38 ) .",
    "giant radioactive halos in minerals were also considered as possibly caused by radiation damage due to @xmath2 particles with energy @xmath39 mev emitted from the central inclusion by she with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "while the old results are summarized in @xcite , we will give below details on more recent investigations .",
    "in the measurements of marinov et al . with natural gold using inductively",
    "coupled plasma sector field mass spectrometry , superheavy isotopes with atomic masses @xmath41 and 265 and concentration @xmath42 atoms / atom relatively to au were found @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that they are most probably isotopes of roentgenium rg ( eka - au , @xmath43 ) . in similar studies on natural thorium , superheavy nuclei with @xmath44 and @xmath45 atoms / atom",
    "relatively to @xmath46th were found , interpreted as possible existence of long - lived eka - th ( @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the evidence on the existence of she with @xmath48 in natural au was not confirmed in sensitive searches with accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) of the vienna group @xcite where few orders of magnitude lower limits of @xmath49 atoms / atom were obtained .",
    "similarly , only limit of @xmath50 atoms / atom was found for abundance of she with @xmath44 in th @xcite ( see also comments in @xcite ) .",
    "the ams searches of the same group for she in natural pt , pb and bi also gave only the limits @xcite : i ) @xmath51 atoms / atom for eka - pt ( ds , @xmath52 ) in pt ( for she atomic masses @xmath53 ) ; ii ) @xmath54 atoms / atom for eka - pb ( fl , @xmath24 ) in pb ( for @xmath55 ) ; iii ) @xmath56 atoms / atom for eka - bi ( @xmath57 ) in bi ( for @xmath58 ) .",
    "recently the ams technique was also used in the searches of the garching group for she with @xmath59 in samples of os , pt and pbf@xmath60 , where only limits were established in the range of @xmath61 atoms / atom @xcite .    in the olimpiya experiment @xcite , in the analysis of @xmath62 tracks from cosmic rays accumulated during @xmath63 yr in @xmath64 olivine crystals extracted from meteorites ,",
    "three tracks were found which could belong to nuclei with @xmath65 .",
    "a more accurate estimation for one of them gave @xmath66 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite .",
    "analyzing recent theoretical calculations , oganessian concluded @xcite that the most stable superheavy nuclide could be not eka - pb with @xmath24 but nuclides with @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( eka - w , eka - re , eka - os , respectively ) .",
    "it was expected that they will decay through chain of @xmath36 and @xmath2 decays which may end with spontaneous fission .",
    "it was proposed @xcite to use thin foils ( @xmath69 mg/@xmath70 ) to register expected @xmath2 particles ( this immediately constrains masses of samples on the scale of grams ) .",
    "a search for eka - os ( hs , @xmath71 ) was carried out in the experiment shin ( superheavy in nature ) deep underground ( 4800 m w.e .",
    ", to suppress background from neutrons created by cosmic muons ) in the laboratoire souterrain de modane ( france ) @xcite .",
    "it was expected that either the initial hs nucleus or its daughter created in chain of @xmath2 decays will finally decay through sf .",
    "the average number of neutrons per fission is equal to @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath71 , very different from that from possible background from sf of @xmath75u ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "an os sample with mass of 550 g was measured during 3 yr with a neutron detector which consisted of 60 @xmath77he counters placed in 4 rings around the sample .",
    "few events with multiplicity @xmath78 were observed , but only a limit on mass concentration of eka - os in os @xmath79 g / g was set ( with the standard assumption that the half - life of eka - os is @xmath80 yr ) . afterwards the os sample was changed with a xe sample ( 140 g ) to search for superheavy homolog of xe ; the sensitivity was estimated as @xmath81 g / g .    in the present work",
    ", we use an alternative approach : instead to search for the spontaneous fission , we look for high energy @xmath2 particles ( @xmath3 mev ) possibly emitted in a chain of decays of eka - w ( seaborgium sg , @xmath1 ) and registered by a radioactively pure znwo@xmath0 crystal scintillator working in a low background installation at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) of the infn ( italy ) at a depth of 3600 m w.e . chemical properties of seaborgium are similar to those of tungsten @xcite , and it is expected that sg in some amount follows w in processes of chemical purification and growth of a znwo@xmath0 crystal .",
    "such a technique , when a source of radiation is embedded in a detector ( `` source = detector '' approach ) , allows to reach practically the 100% efficiency in the registration of the process and to use samples with masses on the scale of kg .",
    "measurements with several znwo@xmath0 detectors were carried out earlier , devoted mainly to the search for double beta decay processes in zn and w isotopes @xcite ; information on their radiopurity was also published @xcite . here",
    "we reanalyze the data for possible presence of she in znwo@xmath0 crystals .",
    "the detailed description of the set - up with znwo@xmath0 crystal scintillators and its performances have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "four znwo@xmath0 detectors were measured ( with mass of 117 , 141 , 239 and 699 g ) . while their characteristics were very similar , the largest of them was also found to be the most radioactively pure @xcite , and in the following we will consider only it in more detail .",
    "here we recall the main features of the measurements .",
    "the znwo@xmath0 crystal scintillator ( @xmath82 mm , mass of 699 g ) was grown by the czochralski method .",
    "it was fixed inside a cavity of @xmath83 mm in the central part of a polystyrene light - guide 66 mm in diameter and 312 mm in length .",
    "the cavity was filled up with high purity silicone oil .",
    "the light - guide was optically connected on opposite sides by optical couplant to two low radioactivity emi9265b53/fl 3  photomultipliers ( pmt ) .",
    "the light - guide was wrapped by ptfe tape .",
    "the detector has been installed deep underground ( @xmath84 m w.e . ) in the low background dama / r&d set - up at the lngs .",
    "it was surrounded by cu bricks and sealed in a low radioactive air - tight cu box continuously flushed with high purity nitrogen gas to avoid presence of residual environmental radon .",
    "the copper box was surrounded by a passive shield made of 10 cm of high purity cu , 15 cm of low radioactive lead , 1.5 mm of cadmium and 4/10 cm polyethylene / paraffin to reduce the external background .",
    "the whole shield has been closed inside a plexiglas box , also continuously flushed by high purity nitrogen gas .",
    "an event - by - event data acquisition system accumulates the amplitude and the arrival time of the events .",
    "the time profile of the sum of the signals from the pmts was also recorded with a sampling frequency of 20 ms / s over a time window of 100 @xmath85s by a 8 bit transient digitizer ( dc270 acqiris ) .",
    "a camac system was used to manage the triggers and the adcs , introducing a rather long dead time of about 26 ms ( in particular , because of storing the time profiles on a hard disk ) .",
    "the energy scale and energy resolution of the znwo@xmath0 detector have been measured with @xmath86na , @xmath87ba , @xmath88cs , @xmath89th and @xmath90am @xmath91 sources .",
    "the energy resolution of the znwo@xmath0 detector for @xmath91 quanta is well described as fwhm@xmath92(kev ) = @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the energy of @xmath91 quanta in kev .",
    "rays interact with matter by means of the energy transfer to electrons , the same is applicable also for @xmath36 particles ; we use abbreviation``@xmath95 '' in such cases in the following . ]",
    "it is known that light yield for @xmath2 particles in scintillators is lower than that for @xmath91 quanta ( @xmath36 particles ) of the same energy @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath2 peak position in the energy scale measured with @xmath91 sources to the real energy of the @xmath2 particles for @xmath96 mev is described as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the energy of @xmath2 particles in mev .",
    "the energy resolution for @xmath2 particles is : fwhm@xmath99(kev ) = @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is energy of @xmath2 particles in @xmath91 scale ( in kev ) .",
    "particles is worse than that for @xmath91 quanta due to the dependence of the @xmath102 ratio on the direction of the @xmath2 s relatively to the znwo@xmath0 crystal axes @xcite . ]",
    "the scintillation signals induced in znwo@xmath0 by @xmath2 particles are different from those caused by @xmath95 particles ( signals from @xmath2 s are shorter ) @xcite .",
    "this difference allows one to discriminate @xmath95 events from @xmath2 events .",
    "we used for this purpose the optimal filter method @xcite . for each signal ,",
    "the numerical characteristic of its shape ( shape indicator , @xmath103 ) was defined as @xmath104 , where the sum is over the time channels @xmath105 , starting from the origin of signal and up to 50 @xmath85s ; @xmath106 is the digitized amplitude ( at the time @xmath107 ) of a given signal .",
    "the weight function @xmath108 was defined as : @xmath109/[f_\\alpha(t)+f_\\gamma ( t)]$ ] , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the reference pulse shapes for @xmath2 particles and @xmath91 quanta , respectively , obtained by summing up the shapes of a few thousand @xmath91 or @xmath2 events .",
    "the scatter plot of the shape indicator versus energy for the data of the low background measurements with the znwo@xmath0 detector during 2130 h is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath103 values for the @xmath2 and @xmath95 events are well described by gaussian functions , with center and width dependent on energy ( the @xmath103 distributions for events in the energy interval @xmath112 kev are shown in inset of fig .  1 ) .",
    "using these dependencies , @xmath113 contours were calculated where 95% of the corresponding events are contained .",
    "detailed analysis of the obtained @xmath95 and @xmath2 spectra is given in @xcite ; clusters within the @xmath95 limits belong to @xmath114k , @xmath115zn , @xmath116tl , @xmath117bi , and alpha events are related mainly with @xmath75u and its daughters .",
    "more details on measurements and data processing can be found in @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional energy spectrum of @xmath2 events inside the @xmath113 contour is shown in fig .  2 where the real energies of the @xmath2 particles were obtained using the @xmath102 ratio given above .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the chemical properties of superheavy sg are similar to those of w ; thus , one could expect that long - lived sg follows w in the processes of chemical separation and growth of the znwo@xmath0 crystals , and could also be present at some amount in the znwo@xmath0 detector .",
    "if in a chain of decays of initial sg nucleus an @xmath2 decay with high @xmath118 value occurs , we can see it in the high energy part of the spectrum presented in fig .  2 .",
    "the superheavy isotopes can decay through emission of @xmath34 particle or by electron capture ec ( or @xmath119 decay ) , @xmath2 decay or spontaneous fission ; cluster decay also starts to be important at higher @xmath120 values ( see recent reviews @xcite ) .",
    "in general , energy release @xmath118 in @xmath2 decay is increasing with the increase of the atomic number @xmath120 ; in accordance with @xcite , experimental @xmath118 values for superheavy elements with @xmath121 lay in the interval 7.8  10.6 mev .    the decay of superheavy sg ( @xmath1 ) will lead to independent events in the high energy part of the @xmath2 spectrum in the following scenario :    \\(1 ) long - lived initial sg nucleus decays through @xmath34 channel ( thus creating a nucleus with @xmath122 ) or through ec/@xmath119 ( leading to a nucleus with @xmath123 ) or through @xmath2 decay ( resulting in @xmath73 ) .",
    "the energy of this first @xmath2 decay should be quite modest ( @xmath124 mev , similar to that in decay of @xmath46th and @xmath125u ) to be consistent with the large @xmath126 .",
    "such a low energy , however , does not allow to distinguish it from the decays in usual u / th chains present in trace amount in any material ;    \\(2 ) the created nucleus ( or one of its daughters ) decays with emission of high energy @xmath2 particle ( @xmath3 mev ) .",
    "the energy threshold of 8 mev allows to cut off contributions from @xmath2 decays in u / th chains because all nuclides in these chains have @xmath127 mev , with the exception of @xmath128po with @xmath129 mev @xcite ;    \\(3 ) this daughter nuclide with @xmath3 mev , nevertheless , should live long enough to be registered outside of the dead time of the data acquisition system after the preceding decay ( in our measurements it is 26 mss",
    ". however , this is outside of the present work . ] ) .",
    "this is also realistic because many of the experimentally discovered to - date she isotopes with @xmath3 mev have @xmath126 in the range of seconds ( or larger ) @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions @xcite also confirm this assumption .",
    "it is difficult to recognize exactly initial sg nuclide and its chain of decays which fulfill all the above conditions .",
    "one of the pretendents could be @xmath130sg with half - lives relatively to spontaneous fission and @xmath2 decay estimated in @xcite as : @xmath131 yr and @xmath132 yr . only limit for @xmath36 decay was given in @xcite : @xmath133 s , and this nucleus is quite stable in respect to cluster radioactivity : @xmath134 yr @xcite .",
    "however , the expected @xmath126 values for all possible decay channels of all potential daughters of @xmath130sg ( and its neighbours ) are not available in the literature .",
    "one has also to remember that all theoretical estimations strongly depend on the models ( and their parameters ) used for calculation of nuclear masses and half - lives for @xmath2 , @xmath36/ec , sf and cluster decay channels ( just for example , in the above mentioned works @xmath135 of @xmath130sg was estimated as : @xmath136 yr @xcite , @xmath137 yr @xcite ) , @xmath138 yr @xcite .",
    "taking into account such theoretical uncertainties , experimental investigations should be performed too .",
    "if conditions ( 1 )  ( 3 ) are fulfilled , we can use the data collected in the low background measurements with the znwo@xmath0 scintillator during @xmath139 h to restrict the presence of long - lived sg in the crystal .",
    "as one can see in fig .  2 , we have @xmath140 events in the energy interval 8  15 mev .",
    "some of them ( at lower energies ) could be related with @xmath128po , some of them ( at higher energies ) could be @xmath95 events ( see fig .",
    "1 ) or the so - called @xmath128bi-@xmath128po events @xcite , but here we conservatively take all of them to derive limit on number @xmath4 of sg nuclei . for time of measurements @xmath141 one can use relation : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the efficiency to register @xmath2 decay in the znwo@xmath0 detector .",
    "it is clear that the probability to absorb @xmath2 particle in the large ( 699 g ) crystal is practically equal to 1 .",
    "we can not estimate loss of efficiency due to the dead time of the data acquisition because half - life of @xmath2 decaying nucleus is unknown .",
    "thus , in the following we will use only @xmath144 determined by the cuts in the selection of the @xmath2 events ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for the half - life of the initial sg nucleus , we will adopt the value : @xmath80 yr which is a standard assumption in the she searches in nature @xcite .",
    "with the measured number of @xmath145 events and very conservatively supposing 0 background , the number of decays is limited by @xmath146 at 90% c.l . in accordance with @xcite .",
    "with all the values given above , one obtains the limit on the number of sg nuclei as : @xmath147(sg ) @xmath148 .",
    "since the number of w nuclei in the 699 g znwo@xmath0 crystal is @xmath4(w ) @xmath149 , one gets the concentration of sg in znwo@xmath0 relatively to w : @xmath150 this value is comparable with the sensitivity reached in the searches for eka - os in the shin experiment ( @xmath79 g / g ) @xcite .",
    "however , the above limit has a drawback : it is given relatively not to natural w but relatively to w in our znwo@xmath0 , i.e. to w which passed processes of extraction from initial w - containing ores ( commercially important minerals are mainly scheelite cawo@xmath0 and wolframite ( fe , mn)wo@xmath0 ) , purification and growth of the znwo@xmath0 crystal .",
    "it is difficult to estimate possible losses of superheavy sg in all these processes but one can try to do this indirectly , using information on the lighter homolog of w : molybdenum .",
    "the following typical values can be found for content of mo in w supplied by different companies : 150 ppm for 99.95% w ( goodfellow @xcite ) , 30 ppm for 99.97% wo@xmath151 and up to 3000 ppm for w ( wolfram @xcite ) , 100 ppm for 99.998% ( except mo ) wo@xmath151 ( alfa aesar @xcite ) , 12 ppm for 99.97% w ( plansee @xcite ) .",
    "if we conservatively assume 10 ppm content of mo in wo@xmath151 powder used in production of the znwo@xmath0 crystal and 1% content of mo in an initial w - containing mineral ( both these values are unknown for our znwo@xmath0 ) , we can estimate reduction factor of mo during extraction and purification processes as @xmath152 .",
    "as regards additional losses of mo during the growth of the znwo@xmath0 crystal , they can be estimated as essentially lower .",
    "for this , we can use available information on znmoo@xmath0 crystal ( which is very close to znwo@xmath0 ) @xcite : content of w in initial moo@xmath151 was 200 ppm , and in the grown znmoo@xmath0 it was 190 ppm , so no w was lost due to the very low segregation of w in the system of melt and solid znwo@xmath0 crystal .    using these estimations ,",
    "the limit ( 1 ) recalculated for natural w can be up to 3 orders of magnitude worse . to avoid this drawback , in future",
    "we plan to search for superheavy sg in similar measurements with natural scheelite ( cawo@xmath0 ) crystal .",
    "the approach to look for high energy @xmath2 s from the decay of natural she ( or its daughters ) , embedded in a detector , can be also used to search for other she .    as an example , bi@xmath0ge@xmath151o@xmath153 ( bgo )",
    "scintillators or scintillating bolometers can be used in searches for superheavy eka - bi ( @xmath57 ) . in particular , in the data of ref .",
    "@xcite collected during 455 h with a 891 g bgo scintillating bolometer in a low background set - up underground at lngs , one can see ( figs .  2 and 3 of @xcite ) 3 @xmath2 events in the energy interval @xmath154 mev ( while one could expect no events after the energy of the most energetic in the u / th chains @xmath2 particles from @xmath128po with @xmath129 mev ) .",
    "the nature of these events should be investigated additionally ( they could be e.g. pile - ups of two @xmath2 signals or bipo events ) but here we just give a conservative limit on the presence of eka - bi in the bgo . in accordance with the procedure given above one gets the limit on the number of events : @xmath155 at 90% c.l .",
    "@xcite . supposing once more @xmath80 yr for eka - bi , this number of decays during 455 h corresponds to a number of eka - bi nuclei as @xmath4(eka - bi ) = @xmath156 .",
    "the number of the bi nuclei in the 891 g bgo is : @xmath4(bi ) = @xmath157 , and thus the limit on the eka - bi concentration in bgo is @xmath158 atoms / atom relatively to bi .",
    "this is better than the limits obtained in recent searches with the accelerator mass spectrometry @xmath56 atoms / atom ( for @xmath58 ) @xcite , demonstrating the good potentiality of the approach considered here to search for she .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that this limit is also obtained relatively not to natural bi but for bi in the bgo crystal after processes of bi extraction , purification and the bgo crystal growth .",
    "while one could expect a reduction factor for natural bi similar to that in case of w , this question has to be studied additionally .",
    "the data collected with a radioactively pure znwo@xmath0 crystal scintillator in low background measurements during 2130 h at lngs were used to set a limit on possible concentration of superheavy eka - w ( seaborgium sg , @xmath1 ) in the crystal . assuming that one of the daughters in a chain of decays of the initial sg nucleus decays with emission of high energy @xmath2 particles ( @xmath3 mev ) and that half - life of the long - lived sg is @xmath6 yr ( that is standard assumption in this field @xcite ) , we obtained the limit on sg concentration as : @xmath4(sg)/@xmath4(w ) @xmath5 atoms / atom at 90% c.l .",
    "this is comparable with the limit @xmath159 atoms / atom obtained for concentration of eka - os in os in the recent shin experiment @xcite .",
    "one should note that the detection of spontaneous fission , as in shin , and the detection of high energy @xmath2 particles , as here , are complementary approaches in the searches for she in nature .",
    "the limit on the concentration of eka - bi in bi : @xmath4(eka - bi)/@xmath4(bi ) @xmath7 atoms / atom was also set from the measurements with a large bgo scintillation bolometer of @xcite .",
    "this is comparable with limits obtained with the accelerator mass spectrometry @xmath56 atoms / atom ( for @xmath58 ) @xcite .",
    "both the limits for eka - w and eka - bi were obtained relatively not to natural w or bi but for w and bi present in znwo@xmath0 and bgo crystals , i.e. after processes of extraction , purification and crystals growth . recalculated for natural w and bi , limits can be lower by a factor of @xmath152 .",
    "the approach followed in this work can be also used in searches for other superheavy elements as eka - tl in nai(tl ) , eka - pb in pbwo@xmath0 , and superheavy homolog of xe in xenon .",
    "it should be noted that detection of @xmath2 particles with @xmath160 mev can not definitively point to a specific isotope ( e.g. eka - w or eka - bi ) .",
    "however , if events with shape of scintillation signal typical for @xmath2 s and high energy will be persistently registered in convincing amounts and alternative explanations ( like bi - po events , pile - ups ) will be absent , this would be an indication on presence of she and necessity to involve also other methods for investigation .",
