    "there has been much recent interest in the so - called @xmath0 gravity theory as an alternative to dark energy for explaining the acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "this theory is a generalisation of the teleparallel gravity @xcite created by replacing @xmath2 , the lagrangian of teleparallel gravity , by a function @xmath3 ) .",
    "it uses the curvature - free weitzenbock connection @xcite to define the covariant derivative instead of the conventional torsionless levi - civita connection of general relativity    teleparallel gravity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and references therein ) has a set of four tetrad ( or vierbein ) fields which form the orthogonal bases for the tangent space at each point of spacetime .",
    "they are the dynamical variables and play the role of the metric tensor field in general relativity .",
    "the vierbeins are parallel vector fields , which gave the theory the descriptor  teleparallel \" .",
    "it is dynamically equivalent to general relativity and so is not really an alternative to it , but a reformulation which allows for a different interpretation : gravity is not due to curvature , but to torsion .",
    "the generalisation to @xmath0 gravity can be viewed as an phenomenological extension of teleparallel gravity ( which is the special case @xmath4 ) , inspired by the @xmath5 generalization ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) of general relativity . however , it has the advantage over @xmath5 gravity that its field equations are second - order instead of fourth - order ( although it is know that , even though it leads to fourth - order equations , @xmath6 gravity can be ghost free ) .",
    "yet , it also possesses disadvantages . although @xmath5 gravity is probably not the low - energy limit of some fundamental theory , it does include models that can be motivated by effective field theory .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 gravity seems at this stage to be just an _ ad hoc _ generalization .",
    "another serious disadvantage of @xmath0 gravity that was pointed out very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite is that it does not respect local lorentz symmetry . from a theoretical perspective",
    "this is a rather undesirable feature and experimentally there are stringent constraints .",
    "a lorentz - violating theory is only attractive if the violations are small enough to avoid detection andit leads to some other significant pay - off .",
    "so far , the only such pay - off that has been suggested is that @xmath0 gravity might provide an alternative to conventional dark energy in general relativistic cosmology .",
    "the specific models that have been considered in the literature bengochea:2009 , yu:2010a , myrzakulov:2010a , tsyba:2010 , linder:2010 , yi:2010b , kazuharu:2010a , kazuharu:2010b , myrzakulov:2010b , yu:2010c , karami:2010 , dent:2010 are rather special as they are tailored to reproduce the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe without a cosmological constant .",
    "however , to do so , a parameter in these models is required to be tuned to a very low value , comparable with the observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "thus , given the lack of clear theoretical motivation for these models , it is rather questionable if this can really be considered to be a resolution of the cosmological constant problem .",
    "nonetheless , given the attention these models have attracted recently , it seems worthwhile to address their viability as alternatives to general relativity in the field of cosmology itself , which was their initial motivation .",
    "we do so by going beyond background cosmology and considering linear perturbations .",
    "we will show that these models behave very differently from the @xmath7cdm model on large scales , and are , therefore , very unlikely to be suitable alternatives to it .",
    "cosmological perturbations in these models have been considered recently in refs .",
    "@xcite as well",
    ". however , in these papers the field equations are written with only partial derivatives and look quite different from the usual einstein equations . here , we will present a covariant version of the field equations of @xmath0 gravity with a clear correspondence to the einstein s equations .",
    "we will use them to derive the field equations for a perturbed friedman  lematre ",
    "walker ( flrw ) universe . as @xmath0 gravity has different dynamical variables ( the tetrad fields ) from general relativity or @xmath5 gravity ( rank-2 tensorial metric field )",
    ", we end up with new degree(s ) of freedom .",
    "this fact has been neglected before , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will show how the new degree of freedom arise in the perturbed field equations , and numerically assess its effects on the linear - perturbation observables , such as the cmb and matter power spectra .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sect : equations ] we derive the field equations for @xmath0 gravity in its original form and rewrite it in the covariant form . in sect .",
    "[ sect : pert ] we give a detailed introduction to the method of deriving the covariant and gauge - invariant linear perturbation equations for @xmath0 gravity theory , and list those equations .",
    "we focus on a specific model with a power - law functional form for @xmath0 in sect .",
    "[ sect : num ] , and study its background cosmology and the growth of large - scale structure .",
    "we summarise and conclude in sect .",
    "sect : con . throughout this work we use the metric convention @xmath8 and set @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant .",
    "in this section we give a brief description of the @xmath0 model and a detailed derivation of its field equations .",
    "in contrast to previous works , which wrote these equations in terms of partial derivatives of the tetrads , we shall do this by expressing them in terms of the einstein tensor plus relevant covariant derivatives of the vierbein field .",
    "this approach makes the equations closely resemble their counterparts in gr and provides a basis for the derivation of the perturbation equations in the and gauge covariant formalism , which is our final goal .",
    "since @xmath0 gravity is a simple generalisation of teleparallel gravity theory , we shall briefly introduce the latter ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) .      in teleparallel gravity",
    "we have the vierbein , or tetrad , fields , @xmath12 , as our dynamical variables ; latin indices @xmath13 run from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and label tangent - space coordinates ; greek indices @xmath16 run from @xmath14 to @xmath15 and label spacetime coordinates .",
    "the @xmath17 are both spacetime vectors and lorentz vectors in the tangent space . as the former ( indexed by @xmath18 )",
    ", they are the dynamical fields of gravitation , as the latter ( indexed by @xmath19 ) , they form an orthonormal basis for the tangent space at each spacetime point .",
    "the metric tensor of spacetime , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the minkowski metric for the tangent space .",
    "from this relation it follows that @xmath23 where einstein convention of summation has been used .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) implies that in this model @xmath20 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are all dependent on each other , which is important for the derivation of the field equations by variation .",
    "general relativity is built on the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath26 where a comma is used to denote a partial derivative ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this connection has nonzero curvature but zero torsion .",
    "teleparallel gravity , or the teleparallel interpretation of general relativity , instead makes use of the weitzenbock connection ( tilded to distinguish from @xmath28 ) @xmath29 which has a zero curvature but nonzero torsion .",
    "the torsion tensor reads @xmath30 the difference between the levi - civita and weitzenbock connections , neither of which is a spacetime tensor , is a spacetime tensor , and is known as the contorsion tensor : @xmath31 it is worth pointing out at this point that , based on the definition we have given above , the weitzenbock connection , the torsion tensor and the contorsion tensor are not local lorentz scalars ( _ i.e. _  they do not remain invariant under a local lorentz transformation in tangent space ) even though they do not have any tangent space indices . ) .",
    "we choose to work in one of these frame .",
    "one could introduce a lorentz covariant formulation of the theory at the level of the action , but this would only change appearances @xcite . ] this is the root of the lack of lorentz invariance in generalized teleparallel theories of gravity .",
    "the lagrangian density of teleparallel gravity is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the determinant of @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the determinant of the metric @xmath20 .",

    "this makes comparison with general relativity rather difficult . in this subsection",
    "we show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : field_eqn_tel ] ) can be written in terms of the metric only and it then becomes einstein s equation .",
    "we also present an equation relating @xmath2 with the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath48 . these will make the equivalence between teleparallel gravity and general relativity clear . on the other hand ,",
    "the tetrad can not be eliminated completely in favour of the metric in eq .",

    "[ subsect : model ] the tensors were all written in terms of partial derivatives , they could be rearranged so that all the partial derivatives are replaced with covariant derivatives compatible with the metric @xmath20 , _",

    "in particular , we would have @xmath51 where we have used the fact that @xmath28 is symmetric in the subscripts @xmath52 . from this",

    "next , from the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath56 as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : contorsion ] ) and the fact that the curvature tensor associated with the weitzenbock connection @xmath56 vanishes , we can write the riemann tensor for the connection @xmath28 as @xcite @xmath57 and the corresponding ricci tensor and ricci scalar are @xmath58 this last equation implies that the @xmath2 and @xmath48 differ only by a covariant divergence of a spacetime vector . therefore , the einstein - hilbert action and the teleparallel action ( _ i.e. _  the action constucted with the lagrangian density given in eq .

    "( [ eq : modified_einstein_eqn ] ) can be taken as the starting point of the @xmath0 modified gravity model , and it has a structure similar to the field equation of the @xmath5 gravity .",
    "note that when @xmath4 general relativity is exactly recovered , as expected .",
    "in order to study the evolution of linear perturbations in the @xmath0 gravity , we have to linearise the field equations . usually , this is achieved by writing all quantities in terms of the metric perturbation variables , and for this we have to use some metric ansatz . in @xmath0 gravity , however , it is the vierbein , rather than the metric , that is the fundamental field , and it has 16 rather than 10 independent components . usually , the six additional components correspond to local lorentz symmetry , but , as mentioned previously @xmath0 gravity is not invariant under that symmetry . consequently , specifying a metric ansatz does not necessarily fix all the tetrad components @xcite , and one needs to specify an ansatz for the tetrad itself and derive the metric perturbations thereafter .",
    "other subtleties emerge here .",
    "for example , one can not write the metric in some familiar gauges ( _ e.g. _  conformal newtonian ) _ a priori _ , as these gauges are obtained by gauging away certain degrees of freedom in the metric fields . however , in @xmath0 gravity the degrees of freedom are different and the lack of local lorentz invariance means that we can only gauge away 4 of the 16 components of the tetrad due to the invariance of the action under spacetime coordinate transformations .    we follow ref",

    "for a quantitative analysis of the evolution of cosmological perturbations in @xmath0 gravity , one needs to consider a concrete class of models .",
    "since the motivation for considering @xmath0 gravity was based on the suggestion that it could account for the late time cosmic speed - up without the need for dark energy , it makes sense to restricts ourselves to models that exhibit this property ( we have expressed out reservations about the theoretical motivation of a general @xmath0 theory in the introduction ) .",
    "thus , we focus on the class of models that can be parametrized as @xmath169 where @xmath170 is some real number . the @xmath171 parameter will be fixed to such a value so that the model can reproduce the late time accelerated expansion of the universe . the minus sign in @xmath172",

    "the modified friedman equation is given as @xmath174 using the fact that @xmath175 , this equation could be written as @xmath176 according to which we could fix @xmath171 by assuming that the present fractional energy density for  dark energy \" is @xmath177 : @xmath178 here @xmath179 is the present hubble expansion rate .",
    "the modified friedman equation can then take the form @xmath180 here the second term in the right - hand side represents the energy density of an effective dark energy component .",
    "given the value for @xmath170 , we can solve the algebraic equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : modified_friedman ] ) to find the expansion rate of the universe at any earlier time .",
    "we have considered five different values for @xmath170 , with @xmath181 , and summarised the results for the background evolution in fig .",

    "the upper left panel shows the fractional energy densities for matter , radiation and effective dark energy respectively .",
    "the black solid curve ( @xmath182 ) is the @xmath7cdm paradigm .",

    "given that we normalise the  dark energy \" fractional energy density by its value today , at earlier times it will be lower in the @xmath0 gravity model than in @xmath1cdm and so the universe will expands slower than in the latter .",
    "the effect on the total effective pressure - density ratio of all matter species , which is defined as @xmath186 , is shown in the upper - right panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : background ] .",
    "note that at very early times the expansion rates in these two models are almost the same , because the effect of the @xmath0 correction ( or the cosmological constant ) is negligible then .",

    "these results show that as long as @xmath192 is close enough to @xmath14 , the deviation of the @xmath0 gravity model from @xmath7cdm is small but the background expansion rate could provide a weak constraint on the model parameter @xmath170 .      having fixed @xmath171 in order to reproduce the desired background evolution , we are ready to consider the evolution of linear perturbations .",
    "these could place much more stringent constraints on the model parameters .    in the section above we gave the covariant and gauge invariant linear perturbation equations for general @xmath0 models . in order to solve these equation",

    "the results suggest that @xmath0 gravity models which are proposed as an alternative to dark energy could face severe difficulties in being compatible with observations regarding large scale evolution .",
    "the expectation that that linear perturbation analysis gives better constraints than the consideration of background cosmology alone is clearly confirmed here as well .",
    "in summary , we have given the modified einstein equations for general @xmath0 gravity models in a covariant formalism , and derived the covariant and gauge - invariant perturbation equations in the @xmath63 formalism .",

    "the equations in specific gauges can then be obtained straightforwardly as shown in appendix  [ appen : newtonian ] .    for a general @xmath0 theory it turns out that no new degrees of freedom appear at the background level , and the modified friedmann equation is simply a nonlinear algebraic equation in the hubble rate @xmath226 that can easily be solved numerically . at the linear order in perturbation there is a new vector degree of freedom ( as a consequence of the lack of local lorentz symmetry , as pointed out in ref .",
    "however , at this order the equations include no time derivatives of this vector , which just satisfies a constraint equation .    after developing the general formalism and deriving the perturbed equation at linear order , we restricted our attention to scalar perturbations .",

    "we also derived the evolution equation for the dark - matter density contrast @xmath227 in a dark - matter - dominated universe , and showed that it resembles that of @xmath1cdm on small scales , but gets significantly modified on large scales .",
    "the large - scale cmb and matter power spectra blow up , signalling a serious viability problem for any @xmath0 models that are able to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe at the background level .",
