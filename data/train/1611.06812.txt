    "the study of anisotropies in the arrival directions of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) as a function of energy is a very important element in elucidating their origin .",
    "identifying such anisotropies is not a simple task since they are weakened by the deflection of cosmic rays in galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the study is further complicated by the fact that the strength of the deflection depends on the cosmic - ray mass composition .",
    "such anisotropies may occur over a wide range of angular scales , and dedicated analysis tools are required to capture and summarise the main features of the angular distributions . in the tev - pev energy range for instance , galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) show complex patterns revealed thanks to the large statistics collected in the last decade by dedicated experiments in both hemispheres . at large scales , anisotropy contrasts at the @xmath2 level are now well established  @xcite .",
    "the dipole moment is generally considered with special interest to probe the particle density gradient shaped by the diffusion of crs in interstellar magnetic fields on scales of the scattering diffusion length .",
    "however , additional effects may enter into play to shape the dipole parameters actually observed , such as the anisotropic diffusion induced by the local ordered magnetic field whose strength is such that circular motions predominate over random scattering . in this case , the observed dipole results from the projection of the density gradient of crs onto the direction of the ordered magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "besides , smaller but significant anisotropy contrasts at the @xmath3 level have also been captured at intermediate and smaller scales  @xcite .",
    "these complex patterns whose positions appear randomly distributed may be the consequence of the particular structure of the turbulent magnetic field within the last sphere of diffusion encountered by crs . with a density gradient",
    ", this turbulence is indeed expected to connect regions of higher density to regions of lower density as seen from earth , and _",
    "vice versa _  @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum , as measured by the icecube observatory  @xcite , is then a natural tool to capture the main output of the complex stochastic process producing the arrival direction distribution of crs , and may help in the future to model and constrain the local turbulent magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "note also that the power spectrum at small scales measured at tev energies may also highlight relevant signatures to probe and study the electric field induced from the motion of the heliosphere relative to the plasma rest frame where the electromagnetic field can be considered as purely magnetic due to the high conductivity of the medium  @xcite .",
    "overall , the measured angular power spectrum is thus , nowadays , a valuable analysis to probe and understand the propagation of tev - pev crs in the local environment , in terms of both the regular and turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "this is essentially because invoking a random nature for the arrival direction distributions of crs allows for a stochastic modeling of non - well known or unknown source positions and propagation mediums ; in opposition to cmb studies where the power spectrum results from primordial and fundamental fluctuations .    at higher energies , the expected increase of anisotropy does not compensate , yet , the decrease in the collected statistics with increasing energy , so that only a few hints of dipolar patterns have been reported . among these hints",
    "are @xmath4 a consistency of the phase measurements in ordered energy intervals showing a transition at eev energies that may be indicative of genuine signals  @xcite , @xmath5 an amplitude of the first harmonic in right ascension standing out from the noise with a @xmath6-value of @xmath7 above 8  eev in the regions of the sky covered by the auger observatory , translating into a dipolar amplitude of @xmath8 under the assumption that the only significant contribution to the anisotropy is a dipolar pattern  @xcite , and @xmath9 a dipolar signal with an amplitude @xmath10 standing out from isotropic expectations with a @xmath6-value of @xmath11 above 10  eev obtained with full - sky coverage from a joint analysis of data collected at the auger observatory and the telescope array  @xcite .",
    "dipolar fluxes are expected in many scenarios of uhecr origin  @xcite .",
    "quadrupolar type anisotropies are also expected in the case of an excess along a plane such as the galactic or super - galactic planes , which are plausible source regions at high energies . in the case of extragalactic cosmic rays , even for a pure dipole gradient at the entrance of the galaxy , magnetic deflections are expected to give rise to higher - order multipoles , although with small amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this , in combination with possible contributions from random configurations of point sources to the cosmic - ray flux that could also be affected by random configurations of magnetic deflections , shows the importance of a multi - resolution analysis of the arrival directions of uhecrs  @xcite . in this work",
    "therefore , we extend previous anisotropy searches to higher multipoles by measuring the uhecr angular power spectrum and performing an analysis , based on the needlet wavelet  @xcite for energies in excess of the saturation energy of detection efficiency when considering events with zenith angles up to @xmath0 , namely above 4  eev .",
    "the benefit of using two methods in this paper is that both of these , widely used in astrophysical analyses , are complementary .",
    "while the angular power spectrum achieves a better performance in identifying large - scale patterns , the needlet - wavelet analysis method presents a higher efficiency in detecting smaller - scale anisotropies , potentially providing directional information on any observed anisotropies .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the angular power spectrum and the needlet analysis are presented in section [ sec : methods ] with their global estimators to assess the anisotropies in different angular scales , taking into account the incomplete and non - uniform sky coverage .",
    "the data set recorded by the pierre auger observatory and used in this work is described in section [ sec : dataset ] .",
    "the results of both analyses are presented in section [ sec : global_search ] , while the conclusions of this work are discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "to uncover possible anisotropies in the uhecr flux , we perform two complementary multi - resolution analyses : the widely - used angular power spectrum analysis , and a wavelet analysis previously used to search for patterns in the cosmic microwave background @xcite . both analyses as well as their global estimators are briefly presented in the next two subsections .",
    "as emphasised in the introduction , the flux of cosmic rays in the energy range analysed in this paper is known to be isotropic within the sensitivity of the previous and current observatories located in both hemispheres and dedicated to study eev and trans - eev cosmic rays , exception made , if confirmed by future data , of a relatively small dipole with an amplitude around @xmath12% above @xmath13eev .",
    "the flux of cosmic rays can thus be considered , to first order , as essentially isotropic over the entire sphere with eventual small anisotropies . in this regard ,",
    "it is convenient to decompose the angular distribution of cosmic rays observed by an experiment in some direction @xmath14 , @xmath15 , by separating the dominant monopole contribution from the anisotropic one , @xmath16 , as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the relative coverage of the observatory varying from 0 to 1 , @xmath19 the fraction of the sky effectively covered by the observatory , and @xmath20 the total number of observed cosmic rays . in this way",
    ", the multipolar expansion of @xmath16 into the spherical harmonics basis @xmath21 reads @xmath22 where the @xmath23 coefficients encode any anisotropy fingerprint .",
    "the partial - sky coverage of the auger observatory encoded in the @xmath18 function prevents the multipolar moments @xmath23 to be recovered in a direct way through the customary recipe making use of the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics basis  @xcite .",
    "indirect procedures have to be used , one of them consisting in considering first the ` pseudo'-multipolar moments @xmath24 and then the system of linear relationships relating these pseudo moments to the real ones . assuming a bound @xmath25 beyond which @xmath26 , these relations can be inverted allowing the recovering of the moments @xmath23 .",
    "however , the obtained resolution on each moment does not behave as @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 a numerical factor depending on @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 for instance ) as expected from naive statistical arguments , but increases exponentially with the particular bound @xmath25 assumed to truncate the multipolar expansion  @xcite .    hence , given the current exposure of the observatory to cosmic rays above 4  eev , the estimation of the individual @xmath23 coefficients can not be carried out with relevant resolution as soon as @xmath32 .",
    "however , based on analysis techniques previously developed in the cmb community  @xcite , it is possible , under some restrictions detailed now and further discussed below , to reconstruct the angular power spectrum coefficients @xmath33 within a statistical resolution independent of the bound @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is to consider that the observed distribution of arrival directions is a particular realisation of an underlying stochastic process which can be assumed gaussian in a conservative way , and which is thus entirely characterised by its first two moments @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in the absence of knowledge of this stochastic process",
    ", the simplest non - trivial situation is to consider that the anisotropies cancel in ensemble average and produce a second order moment that does not depend on the position on the sphere but only on the angular separation between @xmath14 and @xmath36 . in this case , the underlying @xmath23 coefficients vanish in average and are not correlated to each other ( _ i.e. _ diagonal covariance : @xmath37 ) so that the @xmath38 coefficients can be viewed as a measure of the variance of the @xmath23 coefficients .",
    "in this situation , it can then be shown that the pseudo - power spectrum @xmath39 ( which is directly measurable ) is related to the real power spectrum through @xmath40 where the operator @xmath41 describing the cross - talk induced by the non - uniform exposure between genuine modes is entirely determined by the knowledge of the exposure function .",
    "the power spectrum can thus be recovered from the inversion of @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly , for a two - point function of the exposure at angular separation @xmath42 defined as @xmath43 the normalization factor being chosen such that @xmath44 for @xmath45 . ]",
    "@xmath46 never vanishing as in the case of the auger observatory , @xmath47 is shown in the appendix to take the form @xmath48 where the standard notation @xmath49 stands for the legendre polynomials . under this form",
    ", it is explicit that the inversion operation of equation  ( [ eqn : cl ] ) is unambiguously defined , independently of the bound @xmath25 .",
    "we now discuss in more details the implications of the hypothesised two first moments of the stochastic field modeling the angular distribution of cosmic rays , namely @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 any function ) .",
    "these conditions are often referred to as conditions of stationarity and expressed in the reciprocal space as @xmath53 and @xmath37 .",
    "although the underlying process governing the stochastic distribution of the @xmath23 coefficients is unknown , these conditions can describe or approximate numerous benchmark scenarios of interest .",
    "one of these benchmark scenarios , widely - used in the literature , relies on drawing sources at random with a granularity in accordance with some density that might depend on the redshift .",
    "whatever the propagation regime , the ensemble average angular distribution is isotropic by construction and the particular anisotropies in each realisation are due to the fluctuations of the positions of the most contributing local sources . even with some types of structure for the local sources on top of the contribution of the numerous distant sources , the random localisation of the observer and a diffusive propagation regime allow a stationarity description of the process , to first order at least . on the other hand , since the stationarity conditions are obviously not comprehensive of all stochastic processes , there are scenarios preventing the power spectrum to be fairly captured with the method used here .",
    "for instance , one can think of an observer and sources randomly distributed within a thick disk on local scales . in the case of a ballistic or quasi - ballistic propagation regime",
    ", some moments , predominantly the quadrupolar ones , would not average to zero .",
    "another example of scenario , that would induce significant non - zero correlations between several moments and thus break the condition @xmath37 , is the one of a unique ` hot - spot ' at some small or intermediate angular scale on top of an isotropic distribution on the whole sphere .",
    "these kinds of scenarios would be better probed and captured by other analysis techniques , such as the wavelet one presented farther .",
    "overall , given the coverage of the sky at our disposal for this study , making use of the stationarity conditions requires the assumption of the absence of intermediate - scale and small - scale structures in the uncovered region of the sky . since the sensitivity of previous or current experiments covering the northern hemisphere is smaller than the one reached in this report ( for instance , @xmath54 times more exposure here than in the recent search performed at the telescope array  @xcite )",
    ", the non - detection of such structures in the northern hemisphere does not prevent the possibility of a hot spot with an amplitude below the current limits . in this case",
    ", the hidden hot spot would influence to a larger extent the large - scale moments , and the stationarity conditions would tend to cancel some multipoles , essentially the quadrupolar ones . in this sense ,",
    "an unbiased estimation of the power spectrum requires full - sky coverage .    to facilitate the introduction to the angular power spectrum technique ,",
    "only idealised quantities have been presented up to here .",
    "the finite sampling of the angular distribution induces poisson fluctuations and requires the introduction of the following estimator for the @xmath55 coefficients  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the observed distribution of arrival directions . in terms of statistical performances ,",
    "the poisson fluctuations induce an irreducible noise on the estimated power spectrum coefficients such that @xmath58 with @xmath59 ; while for isotropic samples the resolution obtained on each recovered power for each mode @xmath60 behaves as @xmath61 note that to obtain these uncertainties , stationarity conditions are used explicitly .    besides searching for anisotropies at each individual scale , it is also important to define a global anisotropy estimator , which computes the departure of all observed @xmath62 in relation to those expected from an isotropic distribution and at the same time penalises statistically the search over many angular scales .",
    "this estimator , inspired by  @xcite , is given by @xmath63where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are , respectively , the @xmath62 observed in the data , the average and standard deviation from isotropic @xmath62 expectations , all of them evaluated at a given scale @xmath60 . in practice",
    ", we obtain the @xmath65 and @xmath66 values using simulated isotropic skies with the same number of events and exposure as for the data .",
    "the choice of a confidence level ( c.l . ) of 99% defines a threshold @xmath67 to accept or reject the isotropy hypothesis : distributions whose values of @xmath68 are lower ( larger ) than this @xmath67 are considered isotropic ( anisotropic ) at the 99@xmath69 c.l ..      the needlet is a type of spherical wavelet that was introduced to search for patterns in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "the needlet may be viewed as a filter which enhances existing global and localised anisotropies of a given size .",
    "the needlet is composed of multiple scales ( _ i.e. _ filters ) , which are sensitive to angular structures of different sizes , ranging from large - scale to small - scale structures . among the variety of wavelets implementations , the properties of the needlets are particularly well suited for the study pursued here  @xcite",
    ": they are exactly localised on a finite number of multipoles that can be specified for a particular analysis , they are quasi - exponentially concentrated in pixel space , and they are directly embedded on the sphere and thus do not rely on a tangent plane approximation , similarly to the wavelet implementation used in  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the analysis presented below is thus to expand the data set onto spherical harmonics and to convolve the expansion with the different needlet scales so that anisotropies of various sizes can be found .",
    "the end result lies in an output sky map in which existing anisotropies are enhanced .    as in the case of the angular power spectrum approach , the pseudo - spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath55",
    "these harmonic coefficients are derived in the same way with the exception that the event map is weighted by the inverse of the auger coverage ( where the coverage is non - zero ) before expansion . for the representation of the data on the sphere and for the harmonic expansion",
    "the healpix package  @xcite is used .",
    "the coefficients are then convolved with the needlet wavelet , renormalised and transformed back into pixel space .",
    "the result of the analysis is a filtered sky map @xmath70 from which a global anisotropy estimator @xmath71 is derived ( cf . equation  ( [ eq : estimator ] ) ) .",
    "the process is described in more detail in the following .",
    "needlets may intuitively be viewed as a convolution of the projection operator @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the coordinates of the centre of the pixel @xmath75 of the healpix scheme ( see equation  ( [ eqn : pixelpowerform ] ) ) , with a suitably - chosen window function @xmath76 . in our case",
    "this is the needlet kernel @xmath77 with its different the scales @xmath78 , which is shown in figure  [ fig : needlets1b ] as a function of the multipole moment @xmath60 . at a fixed maximum multipole",
    "moment , the width of the needlet scales and consequently the number of available @xmath78-scales is determined by the parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the properties of @xmath80 ensure a quasi - exponential localization property of the needlet  @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath81 is used in the analysis which gives a reasonable range of scales ( six in our case , see figure  [ fig : needlets1b ] and section  [ sec : needres ] ) and is a good trade - off between a tighter localization in harmonic space versus in pixel space .",
    "this choice is based on extensive monte - carlo sensitivity studies to various kinds of anisotropy scenarios such as dipole , quadrupole , catalogue - based and point - source scenario ) . ] .",
    "we choose the respective values to give an overall good sensitivity to detect anisotropies across the various scenarios .",
    "for example , a lower value of the ( threshold ) parameter in equation  ( [ eqn : nthreshold ] ) leads to a better sensitivity to large - scale structures but to a lower sensitivity to small - scale , localised structures such as point sources .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : needlets1b ] , small @xmath78-scales are sensitive to large - scale structures and _ vice versa_.     as a function of the multipole moment @xmath60 at different needlet scales @xmath78 . ]",
    "the needlet is convolved with the ( pseudo ) harmonic coefficients for each scale @xmath78 individually . after the convolution",
    "a backwards transformation is performed , resulting in a set of ` power ' sky maps @xmath82 .",
    "the signal power @xmath83 in each pixel @xmath75 ( in the healpix scheme ) and scale @xmath78 is then given by @xcite : @xmath84 here @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the coordinates of the centre of the pixel @xmath75 of the healpix scheme and @xmath85 is a normalisation factor given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the number of pixels on the sphere .",
    "to combine the different scales and to search for deviations from isotropy in the sky map , each individual scale @xmath78 is normalised as described in the following :    * first , a large set of isotropic sky maps with a given number of observed events is simulated as would be detected by an observatory with a given exposure . *",
    "second , from this set the mean pixel power @xmath88 and the pixel power fluctuations @xmath89 of each pixel @xmath75 in each scale @xmath78 are determined . in the case of a uniform sky exposure , the means and the variances would be identical for all pixels . on the other hand , in the case of non - uniform / incomplete exposure , they depend on the declination and/or right ascension . * third ,",
    "each pixel power value is replaced by the pixel significance ( as in @xcite ) @xmath90 * fourth , to reduce the still remaining background in the individual scales , each pixel which satisfies @xmath91 is assigned a value of zero .",

    ", this value is chosen to give good sensitivity to anisotropies over a wide range of scales , determined using monte - carlo simulations . *",
    "fifth , a combined filtered sky map is created by summing up all scales @xmath78 of interest @xmath93 depending on the intended analysis , one may only use one or two scales ( _ e.g. _ @xmath94 ) or all scales which are sensitive up to a given multipole moment @xmath60 to perform an undirected search ,",
    "_ i.e. _ over all angular scales , for anisotropy . * finally , to determine the anisotropy level of a given filtered sky map , we define the @xmath71 anisotropy estimator in analogy to the @xmath68 estimator ( equation ( [ eq : estimator ] ) ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the number of pixels where @xmath97 does not vanish .",
    "+    the @xmath71-values of a different set of isotropic test sky maps are combined to create an expectation of the @xmath71-value distribution in case of isotropy .",
    "the method to determine whether a given signal sky map deviates from isotropy at a given c.l .",
    "is identical to that for the angular power spectrum .",
    "note that when only one single @xmath78-scale is analysed , no pixel of a given sky map might pass the threshold introduced in equation  ( [ eqn : nthreshold ] ) . in this case , a flat distribution in the @xmath71-distribution of sky maps not passing the cut is assumed .",
    "the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , located in malarge , argentina , is the world s largest cosmic - ray observatory .",
    "its design comprises a surface detector ( sd ) made up of an array of 1660 water - cherenkov detectors spread over 3000  km@xmath98 overlooked by an air - fluorescence detector ( fd ) comprising a total of 27 telescopes .",
    "the sd samples the particle components of extensive air showers on the ground with a duty cycle of nearly @xmath99 .",
    "although the fd has a smaller duty cycle of @xmath10015@xmath69 , its calorimetric measurement of the shower energy deposited in the atmosphere is very important for the calibration of the sd energy reconstruction .",

    "vertical and inclined events are defined as those events with zenith angle smaller than @xmath103 and from @xmath103 up to @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the set of events was divided in two energy bins : @xmath105 and @xmath106  eev . with these energy ranges",
    "we have exploited the fact that the surface detector of the pierre auger observatory is fully efficient for vertical events with an energy above 3  eev @xcite and for horizontal events with an energy above 4  eev @xcite , making the determination of the exposure straightforward as systematic uncertainties on trigger and other effects become negligible .",

    "no significant departure from isotropic expectations at any angular scale is observed in the energy bin between 4 and 8 eev for both analyses . on the other hand , for events with energy above 8  eev , a significant departure from isotropy",
    "is captured in the dipole scale , while no additional deviation from isotropy is observed at any other scale .",
    "the dipolar amplitude and its uncertainty reconstructed by the angular power spectrum are @xmath117 , free of contaminations from multipoles of higher order that would result from a gaussian stochastic process shaping these multipoles in an isotropic way in ensemble average - which excludes scenarios in which the stochastic process would describe strongly constrained geometries for the source positions and produce in particular quadrupole moments tied to the observer environment . besides , the dipolar amplitude reconstructed by the needlet analysis is @xmath118 , pointing in the direction ( @xmath119 . both amplitude measurements are thus consistent with each other .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6-values , as obtained by the global estimators after accounting for searches blindly performed at several angular scales , are @xmath120 in the case of the angular power spectrum , and @xmath121 in the case of the needlet analysis .",

    "future work will profit from the increased statistics , allowing us to reveal whether or not the dipole parameters derived above 8  eev are established with larger significance . for extragalactic crs , the firm detection of a dipole moment with an amplitude of the order as measured implies that the milky way is embedded into , at least , a density gradient . the eventual detection of significant multipole moments beyond the dipole one would be suggestive of significant higher derivatives than the gradient to describe the density of crs outside from the galaxy",
    "together with updated descriptions of the galactic magnetic field to ` unfold ' the anisotropy parameters observed at earth by the magnetic deflections , these future studies will help in probing both the source distribution and the propagation regime of extragalactic crs needed to produce a density of particles outside of the galaxy compatible with the one inferred from the kind of measurements performed in this article .",

    "in this appendix , we give more details on the method used in this paper to deconvolve the effects of a partial - sky coverage for recovering the underlying power spectrum . the incomplete and non - uniform exposure of the pierre auger observatory",
    "gives rise to a mixing between different modes . to recover the power spectrum ,",
    "the starting point is then that the harmonic transform of the product @xmath122 is the convolution of the harmonic transforms of these functions .",
    "this way we can relate the ensemble averages of the mode - coupled angular power spectrum @xmath123 and of the true underlying one @xmath124 by  @xcite @xmath125 where the matrix @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 making use of the addition theorem of the spherical harmonics , @xmath126 can be expressed in terms of the legendre polynomials as @xmath128 where @xmath129 , and @xmath46 is the two - point correlation function of @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath47 matrix elements obviously satisfy @xmath130 . on inserting into this identity the explicit expression of the @xmath41 elements , on multiplying both sides by @xmath131 and on summing over @xmath60 ,",
    "the completeness relation of the legendre polynomials allows us to get at the system @xmath132 for a non - vanishing @xmath133 function , both sides of this expression can be divided by @xmath133 .",
    "then , on multiplying both sides by @xmath134 and on integrating over @xmath135 , the orthogonality of the legendre polynomials allows us to get at @xmath136 which corresponds to equation  ( [ eqn : minv ] ) .      for a recent review ,",
