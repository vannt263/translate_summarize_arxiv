    "hence , disk formation in the class 0 stage is still controversial .",
    "this is because disks are generally difficult to identify in class 0 sources due to the overwhelming emission from protostellar envelopes and outflows .",

    "it seems to have a slight dip toward the protostar position as shown in the intensity profile along the line perpendicular to the outflow axis ( figure @xmath66 ) .",
    "this feature of cch is consistent with that reported by jrgensen et al .",
    "although the spectrum of cch at the protostar position is complicated because of the two hyperfine components ( figure @xmath68 ) , the line width of each hyperfine component of cch is @xmath69 or less , as in the case of h@xmath1co .",

    "the outflow has a redshifted component extending to the northeast from the protostar and a blueshifted component extending to the southwest from the protostar .",
    "since the redshifted and blueshifted lobes of the outflow show little overlap with each other around the protostar , the outflow axis seems to be close to the plane of the sky , indicating that the disk / envelope geometry is almost edge - on . the highest velocity at a certain distance to the protostar linearly increases as a function of the distance , as often observed for outflow cavities ( e.g. , lee et al . 2000 ; arce et al .",
    "the intense knot in the redshifted component corresponds to clump a in figure @xmath57(a ) .",
    "in addition to the high - velocity component , another velocity component can be seen around the systemic velocity ( @xmath87 km s@xmath37 ; sakai et al .",
    "this component is slightly blueshifted on the northeastern side of the protostar and redshifted on the southwestern side of the protostar , which is the reverse case compared to the high - velocity component .",

    "this discrepancy seems to originate from the limited spatial resolution of their data .",
    "another possibility is that the outflow direction on small scales is different from that on larger scales ( e.g. , sakai et al .",

    "figure @xmath102 shows the pv diagram of cch ( @xmath103 ) along the outflow axis through the protostar position .",

    "we prepared pv diagrams .    figures @xmath107(a ) and ( b ) show the pv diagrams of h@xmath1co ( @xmath58@xmath59 ) along the two lines centered at the protostar position shown in figure @xmath57(f ) .",

    "two emission peaks are seen in figure @xmath107(b ) , one of which is redshifted in the northeastern side of the protostar position and the other is blueshifted in the southwestern side .",
    "this systematic velocity gradient in figure @xmath107(b ) is the same case of that in the outflow , but the modest velocity gradient in the vicinity of the protostar is difficult to attribute to the outflow , according to our outflow model .",
    "considering the outflow direction and the inclination angle , the outflow - envelope structure of this source is expected to be like a schematic illustration shown in the upper panel of figure @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the velocity gradient could be a signature of an infalling motion in the envelope rather than outflow .",
    "an infalling / rotating signature is not clearly seen in the pv diagrams for cch ( @xmath103 ) ( figures @xmath107(c ) and ( d ) ) , in contrast with the well - studied low - mass class 0 protostar l1527 ( sakai et al .",
    "2014a , 2014b ) at a distance of @xmath111 pc ( torres et al .",
    "2007 ) . in l1527 , whose protostellar mass and inclination angle are @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , the velocity shift from the systemic velocity observed for the cch line is @xmath114 km s@xmath37 at a radius of @xmath115 au from the protostar ( sakai et al .",
    "on the other hand , the velocity shifts from the systemic velocity are as small as @xmath116 km s@xmath37 and @xmath117 km s@xmath37 for h@xmath1co and cch , respectively , in iras 153983359 ( figure @xmath107 ) , despite the low inclination angle of this source ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "although iras 153983359 is similar to l1527 in its large - scale ( @xmath118 a few @xmath119 au ) chemical composition ( sakai et al .",
    "2009 ) , the infalling / rotating motion is not very clear .    in this observation , we resolve structure down to @xmath120 au ( @xmath0 ) around the protostar .",
    "nevertheless the observed line width is narrow .",
    "this means that the doppler shift due to infalling / rotating motions around the protostar should be small . in principle , the small velocity shift could be explained if the dense gas were not associated with the protostar , that is , if it were mostly present in the outflow",
    ". however , this possibility seems unlikely because the outflow motion can not well explain the velocity gradient in figure @xmath107(b ) for h@xmath1co , as mentioned above .",
    "hence , the small velocity shift likely implies a low protostellar mass .",
    "the upper limit of the central mass is roughly estimated from the maximum velocity shifts from the systemic velocity . under the energy conservation law",
    ", the central mass @xmath121 can be represented in terms of the infalling velocity ( @xmath122 ) and the rotation velocity ( @xmath123 ) at the distance @xmath124 to the protostar as : @xmath125 by use of this relation , the central mass can roughly be estimated to be smaller than @xmath4 with a maximum velocity of less than @xmath116 km s@xmath37 at @xmath0 ( @xmath120 au ) from the protostar .",
    "here , we assume as a robust case that the infalling velocity and the rotating velocity are both the observed maximum value of @xmath126 in figure @xmath107(a ) . in the case of no rotation ( free fall ) ,",
    "the upper limit to the central mass is estimated to be about @xmath127 .      in the case of l1527 , which has similar chemical features to iras 153983359 , the toy model of the infalling rotating envelope shown in figure",
    "@xmath110 has been applied to analyze the observational results for c - c@xmath21h@xmath1 and cch ( sakai et al .",
    "2014a , 2014b ) .",
    "this model assumes that the gas motion follows the particle motion , which is governed by the gravity of the central mass with conservation of energy and angular momentum .",
    "a power - law distribution of the density is employed , and the intensity is assumed to be proportional to the column density along the line of sight . in spite of such a simple model , the basic features of the pv diagrams observed in l1527 for c - c@xmath21h@xmath1 and cch are well reproduced .",
    "therefore , it is worth applying the same model to the velocity structure observed for h@xmath1co and cch in iras 153983359 . in l1527 , cch resides only in infalling rotating the envelope .",
    "hence , it is preferable to examine the toy model with the cch line .",
    "however , the pv diagrams of cch in iras 153983359 are complex due to the hyperfine structure , and their s / ns are insufficient for critical comparison .",
    "in contrast , the emission of h@xmath1co ( @xmath58@xmath59 ) is bright enough in iras 153983359 .",
    "although h@xmath1co is present in the inner disk - like structure as well as the infalling rotating envelope in l1527 , the latter contribution is significant ( sakai et al .",

    "the blue contours represent the model results . unlike in the l1527 case",
    ", we can not determine the radius of the centrifugal barrier from the pv diagram because of absence of an obvious rotation signature .",
    "nevertheless , we can roughly estimate its upper limit from the cch distribution .",
    "if cch is present only in the infalling rotating envelope as in the case of l1527 and the radius of the centrifugal barrier is larger than the synthesized beam ( @xmath0 ; @xmath120 au ) , a hole in the cch distribution toward the protostar position should be resolved .",
    "although an intensity dip toward the center is marginally seen in the cch distribution ( figure @xmath66 ) , it is not well resolved in the present observation .",
    "hence , we set the upper limit of the centrifugal radius to @xmath129 au .",

    "the models with a central mass of @xmath130 and a radius of the centrifugal barrier of @xmath131 au are chosen as the best simulations among the @xmath132 models shown in figure @xmath128 by eye .",
    "the mass is consistent with the upper limit estimated in section 3.3 .",
    "thus , the low protostellar mass can be confirmed with this simulation .",
    "we also simulated the pv diagrams along the different directions through the protostar position shown in figure @xmath82 ( the six broken arrows labeled as  @xmath108 \" ,  @xmath96 \" ,  @xmath133 \" ,  @xmath109 \" ,  @xmath134 \" ,  @xmath135 \" ) for certain values of the central mass ( @xmath130 ) and the centrifugal barrier ( @xmath136 au ) as an example ( figure @xmath137 ) . the trends of a velocity gradient around the protostar are reproduced by the model .",
    "the low mass of the protostar iras 153983359 ( @xmath138 ) is essentially derived from the narrow line width in the inner envelope ( @xmath139 au ) which has an almost edge - on configuration .",
    "the above mass estimate may suffer from the uncertainty of the inclination angle of the envelope / disk .",
    "if the inclination angle is larger , the mass evaluated by the model becomes larger .",
    "however , the upper limit of the protostellar mass does not change significantly , even if an inclination angle of @xmath96 is employed .    by use of the dynamical timescale of the extended outflow ( @xmath116@xmath140 yr for each lobe ; u.a .",
    ", yildiz et al . submitted to a&a ) and the upper limit of the central mass ( @xmath138 ) obtained in this study , the average accretion rate is calculated to be less than @xmath141 yr@xmath37 .",

    "hence , the mass accretion rate and the mass outflow rate are roughly comparable to each other .    on the other hand , the mass accretion rate can be estimated by use of the equation ( palla & stahler 1991 ) : @xmath150 where the @xmath151 is the luminosity and the @xmath152 the radius of the protostar . by using the obtained upper limit to @xmath121",

    "( 2013 ) , the average mass accretion rate is not very different from the canonical value ( @xmath142@xmath145 ) .    on the other hand , the upper limit of the protostar / envelope mass ratio is evaluated to be @xmath158 from the upper limit of the protostellar mass of @xmath4 and an envelope mass of @xmath159 ( kristensen et al .",

    "hence , the ratio seems smaller than that in l1527 ( @xmath161 ; tobin et al . 2012 ) .",
    "this implies that the protostar is in the infant stage and is still growing .",
    "since the specific angular momentum brought into the inner region is smaller in the earlier stage of the protostellar evolution , it seems likely that the rotation signature is not so evident as in the l1527 case .",
    "the h@xmath1co distribution has a centrally concentrated component with a single - peaked distribution , whereas the cch distribution is more flattened ( figure @xmath66 ) .",

    "if this component really represents the contribution of a rotationally supported disk , it suggests that a disk structure is formed already in the early stages of the low - mass star formation .",

    "hence , the chemical evolution can be investigated even in the disk - forming stage .",
    "this paper makes use of the following alma data set ads / jao.alma@xmath1662011.0.00777.s .",
    "alma is a partnership of the eso ( representing its member states ) , the nsf ( usa ) and nins ( japan ) , together with the nrc ( canada ) and the nsc and asiaa ( taiwan ) , in cooperation with the republic of chile . the joint alma observatory is operated by the eso , the aui / nrao and the naoj .",
    "the authors are grateful to the alma staff for their excellent support . n.s . and s.y .",
    "acknowledge financial support from grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technologies of japan ( 21224002 , 25400223 , and 25108005 ) .",
    "thanks the advanced leading graduate course for photon science ( alps ) for financial support .",
    "in our envelope model , the three - dimensional space is sectioned into meshes centered around the protostar , as shown in figure @xmath167 , and each mesh has data of the abundance of the gas and the velocity field .",
    "the intensities of the emission from the meshes are calculated under the assumptions as follows .    *",
    "the motion of the gas is approximated by the particle motion , where the gas pressure is neglected .",
    "the particle motion is governed only by the gravity of the central mass with conservation of its energy and angular momentum . *",
    "the envelope has a flared shape with a flared angle of @xmath3 .",
    "its outer radius is fixed to be @xmath168 au , which is the radius shown in figure @xmath107(a ) . *",
    "although the envelope is not spherical , the density of the gas in the envelope is assumed to be proportional to @xmath169 outside the centrifugal barrier for simplicity ( e.g. , shu 1977 ; ohashi et al .",
    "1997 ; harvey et al .",
    "this corresponds to the density profile of an infalling cloud .",
    "however , this choice is rather arbitrary in this study , because our main interest in this model is on the velocity field of the gas around the protostar .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the gas is absent inward of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "namely , no rotationally supported disk structure is considered .",
    "this can be justified by a lack of the clear keplerian rotation feature in the pv diagram . *",
    "the molecular emission is simply assumed to be optically thin .",
    "therefore , the intensity is just proportional to the number of molecules along the line of sight .",
    "no radiative transfer effects are considered . *",
    "the spectral line has a gaussian profile with a line width of @xmath170 km s@xmath37 , and the emission is observed with a gaussian beam with a fwhm of @xmath171 . *",
    "the number of the meshes is fixed to be @xmath172 and each mesh is a cube with a size of @xmath173 ( @xmath174 au ) .",
    "the velocities of the gas are discretized with a step of @xmath160 km s@xmath37 .",
    "the model parameters are the inclination angle @xmath175 , the central mass @xmath121 , and the radius of the centrifugal barrier @xmath176 .",
    "the radius of the centrifugal barrier is represented as @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the gravitational constant .",
    "it is the radius at which all the kinetic energy is converted to the rotational energy , and is determined by the relative strength of the gravitational force and the centrifugal force .",
    "hence , specification of @xmath176 and @xmath121 means specification of the specific angular momentum @xmath179 .",
    "the infalling and rotating velocities of particles at the distance @xmath124 to the protostar are represented as follows : @xmath180    arce , h.g . ,",
