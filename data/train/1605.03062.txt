    "the results of the `` beam splitting '' experiment at lcls @xcite , demonstrated that even the direction of emission of coherent undulator radiation is beyond the predictive power of conventional synchrotron radiation ( sr ) theory .",
    "that experiment constituted the original basis for arguing that there must be something wrong with the theory .",
    "in fact , in open contrast with it , after a microbunched electron beam is kicked on a large angle compared to the divergence of the fel radiation , powerful emission of coherent radiation has been observed in the kicked direction @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite we demonstrated that the effect of aberration of light supplies the basis for a quantitative description of this phenomenon .",
    "maxwell s theory is usually treated under the standard time order , which is based on the use of clocks in uniform motion with respect to the laboratory frame ( i.e. in rest with respect to the uniform motion imprinted by the kick ) and synchronized by light - signals .",
    "in contrast to this , particle dynamics is usually based on a different time order ( non - standard , or absolute - time synchronization convention ) , which is based on the use of clocks at rest with respect to the laboratory frame and synchronized by light - signals .",
    "this essential point has never received attention in the physics community .",
    "there are two possible ways of coupling fields and particles in this situation . the first , lorentz s prerelativistic way , consists in a `` translation '' of maxwell s electrodynamics to the absolute time world - picture . the second , einstein s way , consists in a `` translation '' of particle tracking results to an electromagnetic world - picture ( that is , to the standard time order ) .",
    "conventional particle dynamics shows that the electron beam direction changes after the kick , while the orientation of the microbunching phase front stays unvaried .",
    "we showed @xcite that a `` translation '' of particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world picture ( or vice versa ) predicts a surprising effect , in complete contrast to the conventional treatment .",
    "namely , in the ultrarelativistic asymptotic ( @xmath3 ) , the orientation of the plane of simultaneity ( that is the microbunching phase front ) is always perpendicular to the beam velocity .",
    "this effect explains the production of coherent undulator radiation from a modulated electron beam in the kicked direction without the suppression usually predicted by theory .    immediately after the publication of the results of the `` beam splitting '' experiment at the lcls , it became clear to us that the conventional sr theory can not even ensure a correct description of spontaneous emission ( i.e. of single particle radiation ) .",
    "in particular , one of the immediate consequences of the beam splitting experiment at lcls is the occurrence of a red shift of the resonance wavelength , which arises in the kicked direction .",
    "clearly , the conventional sr theory predicts a zero red shift for a fundamental reason related to the doppler effect .",
    "in fact , before and after the kick , the electron has the same speed . since in terms of conventional sr theory",
    "an electron emits spontaneous undulator radiation without red shift in the kicked direction , we insist on performing an uncomplicated and inexpensive experiment at 3rd generation light sources that can confute the conventional theoretical approach .    in this work",
    "we stress that the presence of red shift in undulator radiation automatically implies the same problem for conventional cyclotron radiation theory .",
    "in fact , the conventional theory predicts that there should be no red shift for radiation emitted by an electron with velocity directed along and across the magnetic lines of force . in the ultrarelativistic limit well - known analytical formulas which describe the spectral and angular distribution of cyclotron radiation emitted by an electron moving in a constant magnetic field , having a non - relativistic velocity component parallel to the field , and an ultrarelativistic velocity component perpendicular to it . according to the conventional approach ,",
    "exactly as for the undulator case , the angular - spectral distribution of radiation is a function of the total velocity of the particle due , again , to the doppler effect . at present , relativistic cyclotron radiation results are textbook examples ( e.g. @xcite ) and do not require a detailed description .",
    "we note , however , that cyclotron - synchrotron radiation emission is one of the most important processes in plasma physics and astrophysics and the results of an experimental test of conventional sr theory would constitute a truly critical experimental test for a much wider part of physics than that of sr or xfel sources .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , in this paper we focus on the description of an experiment which can reveal the difference between the predictions of conventional sr theory and our proposed correction in some commonly used setups .    in the following",
    "we will assume a filament electron beam approximation , that allows us to take advantage of analytical presentations for single particle sr fields .",
    "this means that the emittance of the electron beam is small enough to neglect finite electron beam size and angular divergence in an undulator . in other words ,",
    "spatially coherent undulator radiation is assumed to be used to test sr theory . in accordance with the diffraction condition",
    ", the electron beam emittance sets the minimum wavelength at which radiation can be diffraction limited .",
    "the performance of synchrotron radiation sources has increased tremendously in terms of spatial coherence during the last years . in particular",
    ", new 3rd generation light sources with ultra - low emittance in the range @xmath4 , which are presently under operation or under construction , can produce practically fully diffraction limited ( i.e. spatial coherent ) undulator radiation in the soft x - ray photon energy range around water window ( 0.25 kev ) .",
    "we also assume that monochromatization is good enough to neglect the finite bandwidth of the radiation around the fundamental frequency , and that the electron beam energy spread is negligible .",
    "contrarily to the bandwidth of a frequency filter , the energy spread is fixed for a given facility : its presence constitutes a fundamental effect .",
    "the typical energy spread for 3rd generation light sources is of order @xmath5 . for the lcls source",
    "this figure is about an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "we studied the impact of a finite energy spread using the expression for the intensity of a diffraction limited beam including energy spread .",
    "we compared , at the resonance frequency , i.e. at zero detuning parameter , the case for negligible energy spread with the case corresponding to an energy spread of @xmath5 for a number of undulator periods @xmath6 , which are typical for 3rd generation light sources .",
    "we found that differences in the maximum intensities are within @xmath7 .",
    "this reasoning allowed us to conclude that the simplest analytical result for zero energy spread can be applied to practical cases of interest involving 3rd generation light sources and undulators with up to @xmath8 periods with good accuracy .",
    "when one needs to specify the angular - spectral flux density at any position down the beam line , one needs to calculate the field at any position down the beam line . in order to do so , we first discuss the field from a single relativistic electron moving without kick along the undulator axis .",
    "we indicate the velocity of the electron with @xmath9 and the lorentz factor with @xmath10 .",
    "we consider a planar undulator , so that the transverse velocity of the electron can be written as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the undulator period and @xmath14 the undulator parameter    @xmath15    @xmath16 being the electron mass and @xmath17 being the maximum of the magnetic field produced by the undulator on the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the resonance condition at the fundamental harmonic is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the average speed in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath21 , the resonance frequency is    @xmath22    sr theory is naturally developed in the space - frequency domain , as one is usually interested in radiation properties at a given position in space at a certain frequency .",
    "here we define the relation between temporal and frequency domain via the following definition of fourier transform pairs :",
    "@xmath23    a well - known expression for the angular distribution of the first harmonic field in the far - zone can be found in literature .",
    "such expression is axis - symmetric , and can therefore be presented as a function of a single observation angle @xmath24 , where    @xmath25    @xmath26 and @xmath27 being angles measured from the undulator @xmath18-axis in the horizontal and in the vertical direction , and @xmath28 being the observation position relative to the center of the undulator . in the following we will always assume that the ultra - relativistic approximation is satisfied , which is the case for sr setups . as a consequence ,",
    "the paraxial approximation applies too .",
    "the paraxial approximation implies a slowly varying envelope of the field with respect to the wavelength .",
    "it is therefore convenient to introduce the slowly varying envelope of the transverse field components as    @xmath29    one then obtains the following distribution for the slowly varying envelope of the electric field :    @xmath30 \\mathrm{sinc}\\left[\\frac{l}{2}\\left(c+\\frac{\\omega          \\theta^2}{2c } \\right)\\right ] \\vec{e}_x~,\\cr & & \\label{generalfin4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 . the field is polarized in the horizontal direction . here",

    "the on - axis angular spectral flux at perfect resonance is given by    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the angle - integrated spectral flux @xmath53 is defined as    @xmath54    if we substitute eq .",
    "( [ dfdom ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ angint ] ) we obtain    @xmath55",
    "let us now discuss the effect of a deflection angle @xmath56 , that is our kick , in accordance to conventional sr theory .",
    "the undulator radiation field emitted by an electron with a deflection angle can be derived after rather cumbersome calculations .",
    "these calculations are based on the well - known formulas for the retarded fields , and were first presented in @xcite . using our previous notation , an explicit expression for the radiation field emitted by an electron with a detuning from resonance @xmath57 and a deflection angle",

    "since the magnetic field experienced by the electron is assumed to be independent of its transverse coordinate , the trajectory followed is still sinusoidal , but the effective undulator period is now given by @xmath60 .",
    "this induces a relative red shift in the resonant wavelength @xmath61 .",
    "in practical cases of interest we may estimate a deflection angle up to about @xmath62 .",
    "then , the relative red shift @xmath63 should be compared with the relative bandwidth of the resonance , that is @xmath64 , @xmath33 being the number of undulator periods . in all situation of practical relevance @xmath65 and , as a result , the red shift in the resonance wavelength due to the increase of the effective undulator period can be neglected .",
    "it is clear from the above that , according to conventional sr theory , if we consider radiation from one electron ( or from a filament beam ) at detuning @xmath57 from resonance , the introduction of a kick only amounts to a rigid rotation of the angular distribution along the new direction of the electron motion .",
    "this is plausible , if one keeps in mind that after the kick the particle has the same energy and emits radiation in the kicked direction owing to the doppler effect .",
    "after such rotation , eq .",
    "( [ generalfin4 ] ) transforms into eq .",
    "( [ generalfin5 ] ) .",
    "let us now discuss the effect of a kick in accordance to our predictions @xcite .",
    "lorentz demonstrated that the principle of galilean relativity , i.e. the galilean law of addition of velocities , holds not only in mechanics but also in experiments involving optics and electrodynamics as long as we neglect effects proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "this accuracy is more than sufficient in our case of interest , because the kick angle ( @xmath67 ) is very small ( order of 0.1 mrad ) , so that a first approximation over the parameter @xmath68 yields a correct quantitative description . in what follows",
    "we will thus endorse a galilean description . according to the principle of galilean relativity ,",
    "the physical laws appear the same in any two inertial frames , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and are related by a galileo transformation .",
    "in the inertial frame @xmath69 , that is the laboratory frame , the electron velocity components after the kick are @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath9 is the beam velocity along the @xmath18-axis , i.e. the undulator axis upstream of the kicker .",
    "consider now an inertial reference frame @xmath70 moving with uniform motion at speed @xmath73 along the @xmath74-axis of the frame @xmath69 . in @xmath70 , the electron velocity components are just @xmath75 .",
    "since all inertial frames are equivalent , @xmath70 and @xmath69 can only be distinguished from one another by their relative speed @xmath73 , and we can transform quantities from @xmath70 to @xmath69 and viceversa using a galileo transformation . now we remind that since we resort to galilean relativity , simultaneity of events does not depend on the reference frame chosen ( @xmath70 , @xmath69 or any other inertial frame ) , that is it is absolute . therefore , the kicked electron , as seen in the frame @xmath70 , reproduces exactly the situation upstream of the kicker as seen in the frame @xmath69 .",
    "however , it is clear from the above that if an electron is at perfect resonance in @xmath69 before the kick and moves with longitudinal velocity @xmath76 , then after the kick the same electron can not be at perfect resonance in the frame @xmath70 , because of the different longitudinal velocity @xmath20 .",
    "we find that the red shift in the resonance wavelength due to the difference between longitudinal velocities can not be neglected in practical situation .",
    "the rule for computing the result in laboratory frame @xmath69 is simple .",
    "one takes the velocity of the light with respect to the frame @xmath70 and adds it vectorially to the velocity of the frame @xmath70 with respect to the laboratory frame @xmath69 .",
    "the direction of the resulting vector is the apparent direction of the source of light as measured at the observer position in the laboratory frame .",
    "the rule conforms to the principle of galilean kinematics , which are intrinsically relativistic , lorentz and galilean transformations are different .",
    "in fact the term @xmath77 in the lorentz transformation for time , leading to relativity of simultaneity , is a first order correction . yet",
    "this term is only conventional and has no direct physical meaning : with a suitable clocks synchronization convention this term can be eliminated . in other words ,",
    "galilean and lorentz transformations are different even in the non - relativistic limit only because they are based on the use of different synchronization conventions .",
    "our point is that the usual description of electron motion is based on the use of clocks in rest relative to the laboratory frame , synchronized by light - signals , and that under this convention only a galilean boost can be used .",
    "in contrast , lorentz transformation is based on the use clocks in rest relative to the frame moving with translational velocity @xmath73 , synchronized by light - signals .",

    "( [ generalfin5 ] ) , the difference consisting in the term @xmath81 in the argument of the @xmath82 function .",

    "when the electron has a uniform translational motion with velocity @xmath73 , the red shift in the resonance frequency can be expressed by the formula @xmath83 , which can be written as @xmath84 .",
    "we now see a second order correction @xmath85 that is , however , multiplied by a large factor @xmath86 .",
    "we thus conclude that both the apparent readjusting of microbunch front orientation and red shift in the resonance wavelength observed at the lcls beam splitting experiment can be quantitatively explained with the help of galilean relativity .    in order to confirm our prediction",
    ", we propose a simple experiment at 3rd generation light sources with ultra - low emittance in the soft x - ray range . the basic setup for a test experiment is sketched in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . the soft x - ray undulator beam line should be tuned to a minimum photon energy ( typically this limit is related with the water window ) .",

    "no precise monochromatization of the undulator radiation is required in this case : a monochromator line width @xmath87 is sufficient . in order for our test experiment to be carried out , it is necessary to control the beam kicking e.g. by corrector magnets . in the case of no kick",

    "in contrast to this , one of the immediate consequences of our theory is the occurrence of a non - zero red shift of the resonance wavelength , which arises because the electron beam has a uniform translational motion with velocity @xmath89 in the direction perpendicular to the undulator axis .",
    "the object of the whole experiment is to confirm or confute the difference in resonance frequencies between the two configurations in fig .",
    "the proposed experimental procedure is reasonably simple and based on relative measurements .",
    "a necessary condition for this type of test experiment is the validity of the filament beam approximation .",
    "there is another interesting problem where our correction of sr theory results is required .",
    "it is the problem of cyclotron radiation .",
    "calculations pertaining radiation from an ultra - relativistic electron in helical motion in a uniform magnetic field are well - known , see e.g. @xcite . similarly as for the case of undulator radiation , however , these calculations lead to incorrect results because of improper analysis for the case of a uniform translational motion of the electron in the direction of magnetic field .",
    "consider fig .",

    "we argue that the angular divergence and critical frequency of the radiation emitted by an electron with relativistic factor @xmath90 spiraling with pitch angle angle @xmath91 about a magnetic field @xmath92 are not @xmath93 and @xmath94 as usually stated but rather , respectively , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .        the influence of the uniform translational motion along the magnetic field direction on the radiation emission can be described purely kinematically .",
    "up to date , our community never considered the question of the method of synchronizing spaced clocks used for describing the particle motion .",
    "however , without a clear definition of this method , any attempt to solve electrodynamic problems will lead to incorrect results . in our previous paper @xcite we demonstrated that galilean transformations supply the basis for a quantitative description of the results obtained at lcls . since the creation of special relativity , most researches assume that lorentz transformations immediately follow from the postulates of the theory of relativity .",
    "however these postulates alone are not sufficient to obtain lorentz transformations : one additionally needs to synchronize spatially separated moving clocks with the help of light signals .",
    "if this is done using the einstein synchronization convention , lorentz transformations follow .",
    "however , if the same clocks are synchronized following a different synchronization convention , other transformations are obtained . the main point behind our criticism of conventional sr theory",
    "is that , under a uniform translation , the electron motion is not described by using clocks in rest relative to the moving reference frame and synchronized by light - signals , but rather by using clocks in rest relative to the laboratory frame and synchronized by light - signals , i.e. following the so - called absolute time convention .",
    "this statement follows from the observation that particle dynamics in the laboratory frame treats time as an independent variable .",
    "unfortunately , in the work of the majority of researches dealing with cyclotron theory development , the synchronization procedure of clocks has either not been considered at all or has been performed incorrectly .",
    "widely accepted expressions for the angular and spectral distributions of radiation from an ultra - relativistic electron on a helical orbit were calculated in @xcite .",
    "let us discuss in some detail the cyclotron radiation emitted by an electron moving in a constant magnetic field with a non - relativistic component of the velocity parallel to the direction of the magnetic field , and a ultra - relativistic component perpendicular to it .",

    "i.e. when the coordinates with respect to axes fixed in the laboratory frame are taken as independent variables .",
    "the second partial derivative is used when @xmath79 is considered as a function of @xmath133 and the `` relative '' coordinates , i.e. when the coordinates with respect to the axes moving with velocity @xmath20 are taken as independent variables .",
    "the relation between the two quantities is expressed by the formula      as to the differential coefficients with respect to spatial coordinates we have @xmath135 ( and similarly @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) .",
    "therefore the dalambertian , which enters in the basic equation of electromagnetism , is a partial differential operator whose change of form can be calculated just by replacing @xmath138 with @xmath139 .    after this replacement , taking @xmath140 and @xmath133 as independent variables , we can see that the inhomogeneous wave equation for the electric field in the laboratory frame has nearly but not quite the usual , standard form that takes when there is no translation .",
    "the main difference consists in the `` interference '' term @xmath141 .",
    "once we have the wave equation in the correct form in the laboratory frame , we may apply it to the study of various phenomena .",
    "following @xcite , however , the discussion of many cases can be based on a mathematical trick , without the direct solution of the modified wave equation .",
    "lorentz found that the solution of the electrodynamic problem in the `` true '' time @xmath133 can be obtained with minimal efforts by formally desynchronizing the `` true '' time @xmath133 to @xmath142 and using @xmath143 without changing the dalambertian in the form outlined above .",
    "it is immediately seen by direct calculations that a shift of time is necessary in order to the eliminate interference term as independent variables , includes an `` interference '' term in @xmath144 , see the left part of eq .",
    "( [ inte ] ) , where both derivatives with respect to @xmath133 and @xmath18 appear .",
    "it follows that , due to the presence of a translational motion , the electron does not radiate like an electron moving on a circle , but it rather picks up extra - effects . in principle , the modified wave equation may be solved directly without mathematical tricks , for example by numerical methods , and one may directly derive wavefront readjusting and red shift associated with the `` interference '' term . ] :      as we continually neglect quantities of second order ( @xmath146 ) , we may substitute @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "the situation is very different in the case of the term @xmath149 , because this term yields a `` renormalized '' velocity of light @xmath150 , which is now involved , instead of @xmath127 in the resonance condition with relativistic velocity @xmath151 .",
    "we come to the conclusion that the interference term described above yields an aberration angle @xmath152 and an effective increase in the velocity of light from @xmath127 to @xmath153 , i.e. a red shift in the resonance condition in accordance with experimental results of the lcls beam splitting experiment with a modulated electron beam . in order to work with the conventional velocity of light , we can just make consistent use of the substitution @xmath154 . in this case ,",
    "the electron velocity @xmath155 will be transformed to @xmath151 .",
    "the treatment presented here shows that there are subtle cancelations that actually lead to a simple result . in order to obtain this result",
    ", we made use of a famous theorem formulated by lorentz , the theorem of corresponding states . according to this theorem , an electron ( or a system of electrons ) in a state of uniform translation with velocity @xmath20 produces radiation with identical angular - spectral density distribution as an electron in the corresponding state without translation",
    "so , the rule for computing the radiation in the case of uniform translation is simple .",
    "one takes the radiation characteristics in the corresponding state and introduces an angle of aberration of @xmath152 radians , with @xmath156 . in the case of an electron in a helical motion with relativistic factor @xmath21",
    ", the corresponding state is an electron moving in a circle with relativistic factor @xmath157 .",
    "this is plausible if one keeps in mind that radiation is related with acceleration , which is identical in the corresponding states .",
    "the influence of the uniform translation is responsible for the aberration of light and is described purely kinematically , as it must be .",
    "the theorem of corresponding states demonstrates that the principle of galilean relativity , i.e. invariance under galilean transformations , is to be expected not only in mechanics , but also in experiments involving optics and electrodynamics in the case when intrinsically relativistic effects ( i.e. effects of order of @xmath158 in radiation properties ) may be neglected .",
    "we demonstrated the effectiveness of this broad conclusion above , when the undulator case was discussed ."
