    "the forces due to quantum mechanical zero point fluctuations involve a frequency scale @xmath1 of motion and are thereby scaled by the energy quantum @xmath2 .",
    "the total magnitude of such forces depend upon whether or not the fluctuations are classical or quantum mechanical in nature . we find for temperatures in the neighborhood of room temperature that the electric field fluctuation force@xcite dominates the hydrodynamic fluctuation force@xcite in the fully quantum mechanical theory .    the einstein theory of purely _ classical _ statistical thermodynamic fluctuation forces will be reviewed in sec.[statthermo ] .",
    "the general results are employed for the specific example of the force on a colloidal spherical particle due to a neighboring hard wall .",
    "the hydrodynamic case is discussed in sec.[fluid ] while the electric field case is discussed in sec.[dipmom ] .",
    "the general theory of quantum mechanical fluctuations are explored in sec.[quant ] and the frequency scales of both fluid mechanical and electrical fluctuations are considered in sec.[frequency ] .",
    "the frequency scales are such that the fluid mechanical fluctuation forces are classical while the electric dipole fluctuation forces are quantum mechanical .",
    "the latter thereby dominate the former as discussed in sec.[qdf ] . although the electric field _",

    "if the bandwidth of experimental observations of brownian motion coincides with a frequency regime wherein fluid mechanics holds true , then fluid fluctuation forces may be ( and have been ) measured .",
    "this point is discussed in sec.[fm ] wherein the formula for the fluid and electrical fluctuation forces are exhibited for two well separated spheres . in the concluding sec.[conc ] , the electric fluctuation forces are shown to more strongly determine the phase properties of a colloid , i.e. whether the colloidal particles will form a smooth colloidal suspension or whether the colloidal particles will undergo phase separation .",
    "let us consider two sets of coordinates , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for the moment , let us fix @xmath5 and assume that @xmath6 undergoes classical thermal fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the einstein probability@xcite @xmath7 of exhibiting a deviation @xmath8 from thermal equilibrium has a gaussian form determined by an activation free energy @xmath9 .",

    "the quantum mechanical version of fluctuation forces will be briefly discussed in the following work where we will explicitly compute the situation shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "we consider two contributions to the fluctuation forces between the sphere and the wall , namely ( i ) fluid velocity fluctuations and ( ii ) electric field fluctuations .",
    "for a single metal sphere ( in a fluid ) with momentum @xmath24 and position @xmath25 , the minimum isothermal work required to produce the momentum is given by the total kinetic energy @xmath26 where the mass matrix @xmath27 plays the role of the compliance in eq.([statthermo1 ] ) .",
