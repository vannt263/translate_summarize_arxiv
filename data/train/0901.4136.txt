    "@xmath6 supersymmetric yang - mills theory is believed to possess an electric - magnetic duality symmetry .",
    "when the gauge group is maximally broken , to an abelian subgroup , this duality interchanges the massive electrically charged particles corresponding to the elementary fields with magnetically charged states arising from classical soliton solutions .",
    "if the unbroken symmetry has a non - abelian component , then there exist massless particles carrying electric - type charge .",
    "although there are no isolated massless solitons , certain multisoliton solutions have degrees of freedom that are naturally interpreted as corresponding to massless magnetic monopoles .",
    "these are manifested as clouds of non - abelian field that surround one or more massive monopoles and shield part of their non - abelian magnetic charge  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper will be to explore the properties of these massless monopoles by studying the interactions between these clouds .",
    "to explain this in more detail , consider an su(@xmath7 ) gauge theory with an adjoint higgs field whose asymptotic value can be brought into the form @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "if the @xmath10 are all distinct , the gauge symmetry is broken maximally , to u(1)@xmath11 , and there are @xmath12 topological charges . if the asymptotic magnetic field is then written in the form @xmath13 , with @xmath14 these topological charges are the @xmath15 . we will refer to an su(@xmath7 ) monopole solution with such charges as being an @xmath16 solution .    with this maximal symmetry breaking",
    ", one can identify @xmath12 fundamental monopoles  @xcite , each carrying a single unit of one of the topological charges , with the mass of the @xmath17th being to unity . ]",
    "each of these has four degrees of freedom  three position variables and one u(1 ) phase .",
    "a bps solution with arbitrary magnetic charges can be understood as being composed of appropriate numbers of the various species of fundamental monopoles and as living on a moduli space whose dimension is four times the total number of component monopoles .",
    "our interest here is not in maximal gauge symmetry breaking , but rather in the alternative possibility , where @xmath19 has degenerate eigenvalues .",
    "the unbroken symmetry is then enhanced to a non - abelian group , and some of the fundamental monopoles become massless . it is instructive to follow the behavior of the classical solutions as this case is obtained from the maximally broken one by smoothly varying the eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "one finds that an isolated fundamental monopole solution goes over to the vacuum solution as it becomes massless .",
    "the behavior of multimonopole solutions is more complex  @xcite .",
    "if the total magnetic charge remains purely abelian , then the solution rapidly approaches its limiting form once the inverse of the smallest monopole mass becomes larger than the separations of the component monopoles .",
    "in addition , the moduli space of solutions and its naturally defined metric have smooth limits ; in the examples where the metric for the case with nonmaximal breaking has been found directly , it is indeed the limit of the metric for the maximally broken case  @xcite .    if instead the magnetic charge has a non - abelian component , none of these are the case .",
    "not only do the moduli spaces not have smooth limits , but cases that are gauge equivalent in the massless limit have different dimensions for any finite monopole mass .",
    "these pathologies are clearly related to the long - range behavior of the non - abelian fields and the non - normalizability of certain zero modes in the massless limit .",
    "a simple example of this arises in an su(3 ) gauge theory . with",
    "maximal breaking , the unbroken symmetry is u(1)@xmath20u(1 ) , and there are two species of fundamental monopoles .",
    "if two of the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are equal , the unbroken symmetry is su(2)@xmath20u(1 ) and one of the fundamental monopoles is massless . in the maximally broken case , the moduli spaces of the ( 2,0 ) and the ( 2,2 ) solutions have dimensions four and twelve , respectively . yet ,",
    "when the breaking is nonmaximal an su(2 ) gauge transformation can turn a ( 2,[0 ] ) solution into a ( 2,[2 ] ) solution , where the square brackets denote the massless species . on the other hand , the ( 2,[1 ] )",
    "solutions , which have a purely abelian long - range field have a well - defined moduli space , with a metric that is a smooth limit of the ( 2,1 ) metric .    in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to configuration with purely abelian magnetic charge .",
    "several such solutions with a single massless monopole are known .",
    "these include solutions  @xcite with one massive and one massless monopole for so(5 ) broken to su(2)@xmath20u(1 ) , as well as su(4 ) ( 1,[1],1 ) solutions  @xcite and the su(3 ) ( 2,[1 ] ) solutions  @xcite referred to above , each with one massless and two massive monopoles .",
    "these su(3 ) solutions will be of particular importance in our analysis .",
    "their properties were studied in considerable detail by dancer and collaborators  @xcite , and we will refer to them , and their @xmath21,\\dots,[1])$ ] generalizations for su(@xmath7 ) , as dancer solutions .    in all of these solutions",
    "there is a single non - abelian cloud ( spherical in the first case , ellipsoidal in the latter two ) that encloses the massive monopole(s ) .",
    "well inside this cloud , the magnetic field approximates the field , with both abelian and non - abelian magnetic components , that would be expected to arise just from the massive monopoles .",
    "the cloud effectively shields the non - abelian components , so that outside the cloud one sees the purely abelian field corresponding to the sum of the massive and massless monopole charges .",
    "the size of the cloud is determined by a single parameter , whose value has no effect on the total energy of the solution .",
    "since our goal in this paper is to investigate the interaction between massless monopole clouds , we need solutions that have more than one cloud .",
    "one might have expected that these could be obtained simply by having more than one massless monopole .",
    "this turns out not to be so .",
    "for example , the su(@xmath7 ) ( 1,[1],  ,[1],1 ) solutions contain @xmath22 massless monopoles , but only a single cloud , no matter how large @xmath7 becomes  @xcite .",
    "[ in fact , for @xmath23 these solutions are essentially embeddings of ( 1,[1],1 ) su(4 ) solutions into the larger group . ]",
    "a set of solutions that do have multiple clouds , and which we will focus on , are the ( 2,[2],[2],[2],2 ) solutions  with four massive and six massless monopoles  in the theory with su(6 ) broken to u(1)@xmath20su(4)@xmath20u(1 ) .",
    "the structure of these solutions was studied in ref .",
    "they can be viewed as containing two su(3 ) dancer solutions , each with a `` dancer cloud '' enclosing two massive monopoles , embedded in disjoint subgroups of the su(6 ) . in addition , there are two larger `` su(4 ) clouds '' , enclosing both dancer clouds , that are somewhat analogous to the cloud in the su(4 ) ( 1,[1],1 ) solutions . as we will describe in more detail later",
    ", these four clouds are characterized not only by individual cloud - size parameters , but also by a number of additional parameters specifying their orientations with respect to the unbroken gauge group .",
    "note that , even in this case , the number of clouds is less than the number of massless monopoles .",
    "a useful tool for studying the low - energy dynamics of multimonopole systems such as these is the moduli space approximation  @xcite , which reduces the full field theory dynamics to that of a finite number of collective coordinates @xmath24 .",
    "the latter are governed by the lagrangian @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the metric on the moduli space of bps solutions .",
    "this method was used to study the ( 1,[1],1 ) su(4 ) solutions  @xcite . because the two massive monopoles lie in mutually commuting subgroups of the su(@xmath27 )",
    ", one would not expect them to interact directly with each other .",
    "this turns out to be the case ; indeed , they can pass though each other undeflected . on the other hand , they do interact with , and exchange energy with , the cloud . in these interactions",
    "the cloud acts as if it were a thin shell , with the monopole - cloud interactions concentrated in the times when the massive monopole positions coincide with the shell . at large times",
    "the massive monopoles and the cloud decouple from each other and evolve independently .",
    "the interactions between the cloud and the massless monopoles are similar in the su(3 ) dancer solutions  @xcite , which have the additional feature that the massive monopoles , being both of the same type , also interact directly with each other .",
    "a word of caution is in order here .",
    "the essential idea underlying the moduli space approximation is that for a slowly moving soliton fluctuations off of the moduli space are energetically suppressed .",
    "if the theory contains massless particles , this needs further examination , since excitation of these modes by radiation of massless particles is always energetically possible .",
    "however , since the source of the radiation is proportional to the time derivative of the bosonic fields , the radiation rate is expected to be small for low soliton velocities .",
    "this has been shown rigorously for configurations involving pairs of monopoles in theories where the massless gauge fields are all abelian @xcite .",
    "although the validity of the approximation has not been demonstrated rigorously for the case where there are massless non - abelian gauge fields , explicit comparison of the predictions of the moduli space approximation with numerical evolution of the full field equations in a spherically symmetric example  @xcite show that they agree as long as the configurations are slowly varying .",
    "of course , this method requires that moduli space metric be known .",
    "it can be obtained directly from the bps solutions , if they are known explicitly . in some other cases",
    "indirect methods based on the mathematical properties of the moduli space can be used to obtain @xmath26  @xcite . however , for other cases it turns out to be easiest to resort to an alternative approach .",
    "the atiyah - drinfeld - hitchin - manin - nahm ( adhmn ) construction  @xcite is a powerful tool for obtaining bps solutions .",
    "it is based on an equivalence between the bogomolny equation for the fields in three - dimensional space and an ordinary differential equation for a set of matrix functions of a single variable , known as the nahm data .",
    "the moduli space of nahm data has its own naturally defined metric .",
    "it has been shown for both the su(2 ) theory  @xcite and for the case of su(@xmath28 ) broken to u(@xmath7 )  @xcite , and is believed to be true in general , that the moduli spaces of nahm data and of bps solutions are isometric.,1 ) su(4 ) solutions , in sec .",
    "[ oneoneone ] . ]",
    "[ in particular , dancer used this equivalence in his investigation of the dynamics of the su(3 ) solutions , and worked with the nahm data metric . ] in this paper we will assume that the equivalence of the two metrics holds as well for our su(6 ) example , and will work with the nahm data metric .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nahmsec ] we review the relevant parts of the adhmn construction , as well as the metric on the moduli space of nahm data .",

    "[ oneoneone ] we illustrate this method by obtaining the metric for the ( 1,[1],1 ) su(4 ) solutions and verify that the nahm data metric thus obtained is in fact equivalent to the metric on the moduli space of bps solutions , which had been found previously  @xcite .",

    "[ nahmsec ] , the result would be rather unwieldy for exploring the nature of the cloud dynamics .",

    "[ largecloudsec ] .",
    "similarly , the two dancer clouds decouple from each other in this asymptotic regime , regardless of their relative sizes .",
    "we have a system of four clouds that are asymptotically noninteracting .",
    "the asymptotic solutions indicate that they are all contracting at large negative times , and expanding at large positive times .",
    "their interactions at intermediate times can be viewed as a series of one or more scattering processes .",

    "we show two typical examples of this in fig .",
    "[ multicloudscatter ] .",
    "both of these simulations were performed with the constant of motion @xmath363 set equal to zero , so that the ratio of the dancer cloud radii remains constant throughout .",
    "the evolution does not depend on this ratio , but only on the sum of the dancer radii , @xmath341 , which is shown by the solid line in these plots .",
    "there is some ambiguity in defining the size of the two su(4 ) clouds [ e.g. , the differences between @xmath364 , @xmath365 , and @xmath215 are negligible at large times , but not necessarily when the su(4 ) and dancer clouds are comparable in size ] .",

    "shows @xmath366 as a function of energy ratio for two different regimes .",
    "the left plot shows @xmath366 for an interaction in which a collapsing su(4 ) cloud overtakes a collapsing dancer cloud . because the cloud velocities are equal when @xmath367 , approaching this value from below corresponds to decreasing the relative velocity of the clouds .",
    "this plot therefore shows that @xmath366 decreases as the relative velocity is decreased .",
    "we see that the two clouds can approach quite close to one another before exchanging a significant amount of energy if they are moving slowly relative to one another .",
    "the right plot is for an interaction in which a collapsing su(4 ) cloud collides with an expanding dancer cloud . in this case",
    "the relative velocity increases with @xmath368 .",
    "we see that as this increases the clouds begin to transfer their energy sooner , and hence at a greater separation .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath366 is about 0.17 in the former case and 0.15 in the latter .",
    "the similarity of the values for these two collision scenarios would seem to indicate that the cloud thickness is a relatively small fraction of the cloud radius , approximately @xmath369 .",
    "the behavior described by these two plots suggests that the clouds act as dissipative media , and that when the su(4 ) cloud moves through the dancer cloud , the energy loss increases with the relative velocity of the clouds .",
    "this explains why when both clouds are collapsing and their relative velocity is small , they can come very close together before significant energy is transferred . in the other situation , where the clouds collide head - on , the energy transfer begins very quickly because the relative velocity is large .",
    "this is also consistent with the behavior of the inelasticity in the collisions that we found previously .",
    "in this paper we have used moduli space methods to investigate the properties of the massless magnetic monopoles that arise when a gauge theory is spontaneously broken to a non - abelian subgroup .",
    "we have shown how the natural metric on the nahm data for a class of su(@xmath0 ) solutions with @xmath1 massive and @xmath2 massless monopoles can be obtained from the metric of a simpler class of su(@xmath3 ) solutions . using this approach ,",
    "we have explicitly verified for the su(4 ) ( 1,[1],1 ) case that the moduli spaces for the nahm data and for the bps solutions are isomorphic , thus lending further support to the conjecture that such an isomorphism holds in general .",
    "we then applied this method to the problem of obtaining the metric for the su(6 ) ( 2,[2],[2],[2],2 ) solutions from the ( 2,[1 ] ) su(3 ) metric studied by dancer .",
    "this gave us an effective lagrangian for a class of axially symmetric solutions .",
    "this lagrangian was then used to study the interactions of the clouds that are the semiclassical manifestation of the massless monopoles .    by examining explicit spacetime solutions ,",
    "it has been known for some time that the spacetime fields evaluated at the cloud radius are not qualitatively different from those at points slightly further from or closer to the origin .",
    "one might therefore expect the interactions between clouds to take place as if the shells of these clouds were diffuse .",
    "however , our simulations show instead that the clouds interact more like relatively thin , hard shells . in the collisions between an su(4 ) cloud and",
    "the dancer clouds the energy transfer takes place over a short interval before and after the cloud radii coincide , suggesting an effective cloud thickness that is roughly 15 - 20% of the cloud radius .",
    "some intriguing open questions remain .",
    "it is known that in type iib string theory one can interpret d1-branes stretched between d3-branes as the analogs of massive magnetic monopoles .",
    "this suggests that massless monopoles should , in some sense , correspond to d1-branes of zero length connecting coincident d3-branes .",
    "it would be desirable to clarify these ideas , and to see if they would help explain the properties of the clouds that we have found .",
    "one would also like to understand better the role of massless monopoles in the electric - magnetic duality of @xmath370 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , where they should be the duals of the `` gluons '' , the massless gauge particles of the unbroken subgroup .",
