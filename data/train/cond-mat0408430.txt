    "liquid @xmath0he is a strongly interacting system of fermionic atoms with nuclear spin 1/2 .",
    "its superfluid state below the critical temperature @xmath2 mk is characterized by the creation of a condensate where the atoms form cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "this is similar to what happens for electrons in superconducting metals and , although @xmath0he atoms are electrically neutral , many analogues exist between the transport properties of the two physical systems .",
    "for example , in both systems so - called andreev reflection can exist , where quasiparticles are converted between particle - like and hole - like branches of the excitation spectrum by the pairing potential @xcite .",
    "however , instead of the singlet @xmath1-wave state of conventional superconductors , the pairing state in superfluid @xmath0he exhibits spin - triplet @xmath3-wave symmetry .",
    "this means that the condensate has internal degrees of freedom , resulting in a complicated structure for the order parameter , and in the existence of multiple superfluid phases .",
    "there is also no crystal potential to impose symmetry restrictions , as in the case of unconventionally paired ( @xmath4-wave ) superconductors . as a result , many of the analogous phenomena occur in a more complicated form in @xmath0he than anywhere else . in this paper",
    "we study the properties of pressure - biased weak links in superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "the weak links consist of small apertures in a wall between two volumes of the liquid @xcite , and , as such , are analogous to ballistic point contacts between superconducting metals .",
    "the theory of superconductor point contacts is well developed , and thus most of the basic ideas may simply be inferred from existing results @xcite .",
    "most importantly , due to andreev reflection , there are bound quasiparticle states localized at the weak link , whose energies are below the bulk gap @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these sub - gap states are responsible for carrying the phase - dependent supercurrents , _",
    "i.e. _ , the josephson effects @xcite .",
    "when the contact is biased by a chemical potential difference @xmath6 , the supercurrents oscillate at the josephson frequency @xmath7 .",
    "under such a bias , also dissipative dc currents will be generated .",
    "the most obvious source of such currents is due to thermally excited quasiparticles , but the resulting current is very small at low temperatures .",
    "however , in the case of a point contact , the cooper pairs themselves may participate in the flow of a dissipative current .",
    "this is because in transmitting a pair between the two condensates , energy can be conserved by transferring the excess energy @xmath8 to the bound - state quasiparticles . as a result",
    ", large dc currents can flow with arbitrarily small biases @xmath9 also at low temperatures .",
    "the underlying process by which this is accomplished is known as multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) @xcite . in this process , the bound quasiparticles are andreev - reflected several times from the surrounding pairing potentials under the influence of the bias @xmath6 .",
    "after two successive retroreflections , a quasiparticle has gained the energy @xmath8 , and this corresponds to the dissipative transmission of one cooper pair .",
    "this coherent process is repeated until the bound quasiparticles escape to energies above @xmath5 , or are relaxed by inelastic scattering . the maximum number @xmath10 of sub - gap reflections",
    "is given by @xmath11 .",
    "in superconductor weak links with non - perfect transparency , mar can give rise to a highly pronounced `` subharmonic gap structure '' ( sgs ) , where the differential conductance is peaked at the biases @xmath12 , with @xmath13 @xcite . on the other hand , in the limit of very low transparency , a tunnel junction is formed , where the sub - gap states and hence mar are completely suppressed .    in the case of superfluid @xmath0he",
    "the sgs is not likely to be observable in practice .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the practically achievable weak link diameters are quite large : generally on the order of the zero - temperature coherence length ( @xmath14 nm ) , and certainly much larger than the fermi wavelength ( @xmath15 nm ) .",
    "since liquid @xmath0he is naturally free of impurities , the quasiparticles simply follow classical ballistics through the aperture .",
    "some non - transparency is introduced by scattering at the walls inside a finite - length aperture , but this scattering is diffusive and its principal effect is to reduce the net currents @xcite .",
    "second , also for practical reasons , the biases @xmath6 in weak links of @xmath0he are always restricted to the limit @xmath9 @xcite , while the sgs occurs on the scale of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , in most experiments @xmath6 is even much smaller than the quasiparticle relaxation strength @xmath16 due to inelastic scattering , which by itself satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "the limit of a low - transparency point contact between triplet - paired condensates was recently studied @xcite , but , as explained above , such results are not likely to be important for interpreting experiments in superfluid @xmath0he . for intermediate transparencies , effects similar to those of ref .",
    "may be expected .    in this paper",
    "we consider the limit of a short point contact with perfect transparency , the so - called `` pinhole '' .",
    "furthermore , we concentrate on studying the bias region @xmath9 , and consider only the b phase of superfluid @xmath0he explicitly . however , some of the general results may just as well be applied for the a phase , or any other triplet or singlet pairing state , and for any value of a constant bias @xmath6 . even though the sgs in the dc current can not be resolved with our assumptions",
    ", there are other details introduced by the complicated structure of the order parameter in @xmath0he , and its modification due to surface scattering .",
    "the equilibrium limit @xmath18 for a @xmath0he - b pinhole was studied in ref .   in detail , and this paper represents an generalization of that calculation to finite biases .",
    "parts of our results have already been published @xcite and we review them here in order to obtain a self - contained presentation .",
    "in addition , we present some new analytical results and a more thorough numerical analysis of the dc current and supercurrent amplitudes as a function of the bias pressure .",

    "the apertures with @xmath327 nm in a 50 nm membrane used in ref .",
    "are rather close , at least compared with the 0.25 @xmath328 m wide slits in a 0.1 @xmath328 m membrane of ref .",
    "second , in order to ensure leak - proofness , the pressure biases are limited to very low values where @xmath9 .",
    "the experiments of ref .",
    "are even restricted to @xmath329 .",
    "therefore , the `` excess current '' limit of eq .",
    "( [ e.exc ] ) , for example , seems not practically achievable in superfluid @xmath0he . nevertheless , the data of refs .",
    "are enough to make a comparison between the most important features of the theoretical and experimental current - pressure characteristics .",
    "figure [ f.ipfits ] shows a comparison between the data of ref .   and the numerical pinhole calculation of @xmath233 .",
    "at indicated temperatures . ]    a diffusive surface is assumed , and we use the parameter @xmath330 .",
    "again we note that although the slope at @xmath18 depends strongly on @xmath260 , the asymptotic behavior for @xmath288 does not .",
    "indeed , at @xmath291 the agreement is rather good for any value of @xmath260 on the order of unity , although a perfect fit for all temperatures simultaneously can not be achieved .",
    "note also that the experimental currents are not even approaching zero in the limit @xmath212 .",
    "however , a better fit can hardly be expected , since the apertures used in these experiments were far from good pinholes .",
    "in fact , in sufficiently large apertures one would expect a transition into a regime where the dissipation is best described in terms of _ phase slips _ by vortices rather than mar .",
    "studying this transition would be interesting , but computationally very demanding . in any case , the overall form of @xmath233 is very similar to the experimental results , and the order - of - magnitude agreement on both axes is surprisingly good .",

    "the apertures used in the experiments reported in ref .",
    "are somewhat better approximations to pinholes .",
    "therefore we have chosen to use these data to estimate the value of @xmath260 for the numerical calculations of the previous section .",
    "the experiments were carried out in the limit @xmath200 , and according to eq .",

    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.ipfitl ] .     at indicated temperatures .",
    "]    the increasing low - temperature deviations in this fit may be partly due to the insufficiency of our normal - state model for @xmath250 .",
    "the currents for the `` h state '' reported in ref .",
    "are larger and more nonlinear than in the l state .",
    "we suspect that part of this nonlinearity may be due to the additional dissipation effects described by eq .",
    "( [ e.avg ] ) @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the experimental apertures already deviate so strongly from pinholes , that the dependence of the bound states on textures is not sufficiently described by simple phase shifts .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented an analysis of pressure - biased weak links between two volumes of superfluid @xmath0he - b by using the pinhole model of a short , ballistic point contact .",

    "may easily be reproduced and generalized to the @xmath3-wave case by parametrizing the green functions with the so - called coherence functions . in the case where the gap suppression at surfaces is neglected , we calculated the current amplitudes analytically in several limits .",
    "in the general case , the order parameters and the pinhole currents were calculated numerically .",
    "comparison to experiments gives strong support to the existence of the mar effect in pressure - biased weak links of superfluid @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "we also predict the existence of additional dc current contributions , which result from the excitation of collective order - parameter modes .",
    "these `` anisotextural '' effects are discussed elsewhere in more detail @xcite .    in order to improve upon the results of the present paper , one should take into account the strong - coupling effects in a more detailed way than with our `` normal - state '' model for the quasiparticle relaxation rate .",
    "one should also consider apertures of finite size , at least by computing the bound - state spectra in equilibrium to see if textures have some significant effect on them in this case . a dynamical calculation for the finite - size aperture should also be performed , but this already seems to approach the limits of practical feasibility .",
