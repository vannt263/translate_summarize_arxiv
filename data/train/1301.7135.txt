    "technology to control quantum systems is rapidly evolving , and various methods to manipulate quantum states have been reported in bose einstein condensates ( bec)@xcite , in quantum computing @xcite and in many other fields of applied physics . for many current and future technologies",
    "the acceleration of controls of quantum systems would be important .",
    "methods of the acceleration of quantum dynamics and quantum adiabatic dynamics or shortcut to adiabaticity have been proposed , e.g. , counterdiabatic protocol @xcite and frictionless quantum driving @xcite , invariant - based inverse engineering @xcite and fast - forward scaling theory @xcite .",
    "these theories make possible to generate target states in short time without energy excitations at the final time of the manipulations @xcite .",
    "recently applications of these methods to the controls of bec including the transport have been proposed theoretically @xcite , and been demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the robustness of these protocols have been investigated @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show a novel application and advantage of the acceleration of the quantum dynamics",
    ".    in actual systems there must be noise which prevents accurate controls of quantum systems .",
    "the influence of the random potential to the static and dynamical properties of the bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been studied by using the optical speckle potential @xcite .",
    "the protection of quantum states from the influence of the noise and disorder would be an important issue as well as rapid controls for accurate manipulations of quantum states like becs and for the extension of the range of the quantum controls . in this paper",
    "we use the random potential as the noise which deforms the wave function in a trapping potential neglecting the dissipation and decoherence due to the environment unlike the quantum decoupling of open systems @xcite .",
    "we show the protection of the quantum states from the disturbance due to the uncontrollable random potential in the background by rapid transport of the quantum states with the use of the fast - forward scaling theory .",
    "it is shown that the quantum states are kept undisturbed for a longer time than the case of the simple trapping with a stationary potential because the effective potential , which the quantum states feel , becomes uniform when the velocity of the transport is sufficiently large .",
    "it is numerically exhibited in one dimension that the alternating transport of a bose - einstein condensate can protect it from the disturbance .    in sec.[model ] we represent the model . and the driving potential for the adiabatic transport is reviewed . in sec.[analysis in large velocity limit ]",
    "we show the protection of quantum states from the disturbance due to the random potential in the large - velocity - limit . in sec.[numerical results",
    "] it is numerically exhibited that the fidelity is kept close to unity by the rapid one - way and alternative transports .",
    "the protection of a bose - einstein condensate is also shown numerically .",
    "we consider a transport of a particle in one dimension .",
    "the driving potential for the ideal transport of quantum states without disturbance was derived , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is the wave function of an energy eigenstate trapped by the stationary potential @xmath1 in the case without the random potential .",
    "the energy is assumed to be zero for the simplicity .",
    "the potential @xmath2 can translates the quantum state without energy excitation at the final time of the manipulation @xcite .",
    "the change in @xmath3 is the displacement of the trapping potential and the wave function .",
    "the first term in eq.([hanav ] ) corresponds to the translation of the trapping potential .",
    "the second term is the additional potential which is spatially linear .",
    "the wave function of the transported state @xmath4 is represented as @xmath5 } , \\label{psiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 denotes the time - derivative of @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the velocity of the translation .",
    "@xmath9 is a solution of the schr@xmath10dinger equation : @xmath11 the additional phase in the wave function in eq.([psiff ] ) vanishes everywhere when the quantum state is stopped and @xmath12 .",
    "now we consider the translation under the random potential @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the random potential is time - independent .",
    "in general the random potential can cause the disturbance of the wave function .",
    "the total hamiltonian with the driving potential is represented as @xmath14 in the following sections it is shown that the disturbance due to the random potential is restrained by the rapid transport .",
    "we show that the fast transport of the quantum states can reduce the influence of the random potential in the case of the constant velocity , @xmath15 , in the large - velocity - limit . in the analysis we use the moving frame which accompanies with the trapping potential . in the moving frame the third term in eq.([hami_12_30 ] ) vanishes and the hamiltonian is represented by @xmath16 the trapping potential is stationary in the moving frame while the random potential is moving with the constant velocity .",
    "we expand the state @xmath17 by the energy eigenstates @xmath18 of the hamiltonian : @xmath19 the state is represented as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the energy of the @xmath23th state .",
    "@xmath18 is time - independent .",
    "the schr@xmath10dinger equation leads to the equations of the coefficients : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "we suppose that the initial state is the @xmath28th energy eigenstate @xmath29 , that is , @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 satisfies the integral equation : @xmath32 for @xmath33 we obtain the 1st order approximation of @xmath34 by substituting @xmath35 and the @xmath36th order solution @xmath37 $ ] in eq.([eq1_13_1 ] ) as @xmath38 we assume that a finite number of the energy eigenstates can have the dominant contribution to the transition from the @xmath28th eigenstate in the 1st order approximation and the others are negligible because of the sufficiently small @xmath39 .",
    "hereafter we focus on the energy eigenstates which may have the dominant contribution .",
    "we divide the time integral in eq.([eq1_24_1 ] ) into the intervals as @xmath40 we take @xmath41 short enough so that @xmath42 $ ] can be regarded as constant in the interval for any @xmath43 , that is , @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "for example the @xmath46th integral with respect to @xmath47 of the last line in eq.([eq1_24_1 ] ) is represented as @xmath48 the integration with respect to @xmath47 is rewritten with @xmath49 as @xmath50 we define the effective potential @xmath51 by @xmath52 which is the average of the random potential in the interval : @xmath53 .",
    "suppose that @xmath54 is the length of @xmath55 with which @xmath56 can be regarded as uniform in the region that wave function is localized . thus if @xmath57 we have @xmath58 due to the orthogonality of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore in the large @xmath61 limit , we see no transition among the energy eigenstates . from the conditions in eqs.([con1 ] ) and ( [ con2 ] ) we obtain a criterion of @xmath61 : @xmath62 with which the level transitions due to the random potential do not occur .",
    "we numerically exhibit the protection of quantum states by the one - way translation with the constant velocity and the alternating translation in one dimension .",

    "we use the moving frame which accompanies with the trapping potential .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by eq.([hm ] ) .",

    "the fidelity is averaged over the dynamics with 100 different random potentials .",
    "we see the decrease of the fidelity with time due to the disturbance by the random potential for @xmath12 .",
    "the fidelity for @xmath79 and @xmath80 is lower than that of @xmath12 .",
    "this is because that the relative time - dependence of the random potential enhances the energy transition .",
    "however , for the sufficiently large velocity , @xmath81 , the decrease of the fidelity is apparently restrained compared to the case of @xmath12 .",
    "the continuous transport reduces the influence of the random potential as theoretically predicted in the previous section .",
    "the variance of the fidelity is about 0.01 for @xmath82 .",
    "the variance tends to be smaller for larger @xmath6 .",
    "time dependence of fidelity in one - way driving .",
    "the fidelity is averaged over the dynamics with 100 different random potentials .",
    "@xmath6 is the velocity of the centre of trapping potential .",
    "other parameters are the same as fig.[fid_p2].,width=264 ]    @xmath83 in eq.([vbar ] ) is regarded as the effective potential that the quantum state feels . to show the property of the effective potential we calculate @xmath84 which corresponds to @xmath83 for @xmath85 .",
    "the distance @xmath86 corresponds to @xmath55 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath87 for the various values of @xmath86 are shown in fig.[veff ] .",
    "effective potential @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",

    "other parameters are the same as fig.[fid_p2].,width=302 ]    for large @xmath86 ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) the effective potential become smooth and uniform compared to the original random potential .",
    "this property of the effective potential explains the decrease of the influence of the random potential .",
    "the distance @xmath91 corresponds to @xmath93 if we relate the distance @xmath86 , the time - interval @xmath41 and the frequency @xmath94 by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .      in actual systems it is impossible to keep translating the quantum state in one direction .",
    "here we show that the alternating translation also protects quantum states from the disturbance due to the random potential in one dimension .",
    "the trapping potential @xmath1 is the harmonic potential as eq.([harm ] ) , and the initial state is the ground state given by eq.([inip ] ) with @xmath12 .",
    "we choose the time dependence of @xmath3 as @xmath97 we continuously translate the quantum state back and forth by translating the trapping potential and simultaneously tuning the spatially linear potential as eq.([hanav ] ) .",
    "the center of the wave packet is oscillated between @xmath98 and @xmath99 periodically .",
    "the random potential is the same as sec.[translation with constant velocity ] . in the numerical simulation",

    "the time dependence of the fidelity is shown in fig.[fid_com2 ] for various values of @xmath100 .",
    "the corresponding value of the time - average of @xmath101 denoted by @xmath102 are shown in the figure .",

    "the variance of the fidelity is about 0.015 for @xmath104 .",
    "the variance tends to be smaller for larger @xmath102 .",
    "it is seen that the alternating translation with the sufficiently large frequency can reduce the influence of random potential .",
    "the rapid falls of the fidelity occur at the time when the trapping potential is turned and starts to move in the opposite direction .",
    "since the velocity becomes small at such time , the quantum state is affected by the random potential and the fidelity decreases .",
    "time dependence of fidelity in the alternating translation for various values of @xmath102 .",
    "the fidelity is averaged over the dynamics with 100 different random potentials .",
    "other parameters are the same as fig.[fid_p2].,width=302 ]      here we apply the method to reduce the influence of the random potential to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) .",
    "we assume that the system is governed by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation : @xmath105 where @xmath66 is the macroscopic wave function , and @xmath106 is the coupling parameter .",
    "it has been shown that the becs are also transported without energy excitation by the same driving potential in eq.([hanav ] ) @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that a bec wave packet is trapped by the harmonic potential subjected to the random potential which is the same as the previous sections .",
    "the initial state is the ground state obtained numerically in the stationary harmonic potential without the random potential .",
    "we alternately translate the wave packet by using the driving potential . the time dependence of @xmath3 and the parameters are same as sec.[alternating translation ] . in fig.[fid_com_non ] the time dependence of the fidelity",
    "is shown for @xmath107 .",

    "we have presented the protection of quantum states from the disturbance due to the random potential by the continuous transport with the use of the driving potential derived by the theory of the acceleration of adiabatic dynamics .",
    "we analytically showed that the fast translation of the quantum states can suppress the influence of the random potential because the effective potential which the quantum states feel becomes uniform when the velocity of the transport is sufficiently large .",
    "we emphasize that the velocity of the transport does not have to be fast enough so that the effective potential vanishes .",
    "we have numerically exhibited the protection of the quantum states by the continuous translation with the constant velocity and the alternating translation of the the ground state in the harmonic potential .",
    "the decrease of the fidelity is clearly restrained by the fast - driving compared to the simple trapping with a stationary potential , while the protection effect is not monotonously increased with the velocity in the small - velocity - region .",
    "it has been shown that the same technique is effective also for the protection of becs from the influence of the random potential .",
    "the optical speckle potential were used to investigate the properties of becs under the random potential experimentally @xcite .",
    "it is expected that such system would be useful to investigate the present method experimentally because the strength of the random potential can be controlled by tuning the intensity of the laser . in this paper",
    "we did not consider the dissipation and decoherence effects .",
    "applications of the present method in the system with the dissipation and decoherence would be studied in the future also with the effect of the time - dependence of the random potential .",
    "we assumed that the driving potential is controlled without error , while for rapid manipulation the control of the potential itself can cause additional noises in actual systems .",
    "the investigation of the robustness of the present technique is a future issue .",
