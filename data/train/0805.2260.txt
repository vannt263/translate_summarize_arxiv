    "recently the discovery of the charged ressonance state @xmath0 by the belle collaboration @xcite has led to the proposal that this state is indeed a radial excitation of a tetratarquark of the form @xmath1 @xcite , being the particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 , discovered by belle and babar , the fundamental tetraquark states ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "others interpret this state as a scattering ressonance of the @xmath6 system @xcite while still others interpret this as a threshold cusp in the same system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 was detected by the decay @xmath7 , but if the model of the tetraquark is correct , the decay @xmath8 could also be possible .",
    "we start to study the tetraquark system , by using the flux tube model , in wich we have a potential given by    @xmath9    the term @xmath10 is the coulomb part of the interaction corresponding to one gluon exchange , and @xmath11 is the confining part of the potential .    the coulomb interaction should be proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the casimir operators of the two particles . since the two quarks are in an antitriplet state we get @xmath15 , wich gives @xmath16 so the quark - quark potential is @xmath17 for the quark - antiquark coulomb potential , since a quark and two antiquarks form an antitriplet , we get a factor @xmath18 for the quark - antiquark interaction @xmath19    as for the confining part of potential it is given by @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the minimum distance that links the four particles as shown in figure [ tetraquark ]    the potential is given by @xmath22    we should solve the schroedinger equation for this potential , but because the form of the confining part of the potential is cumbersome , we approximate our system by a system of a diquark and a di - antiquark , so that we only have the interaction between quarks ( antiquarks ) in the diquark ( diantiquark ) and the interaction diquark - diantiquark .",
    "our simplified potential is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the centers of mass of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 system .",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29    so we define the coordinates @xmath30    then we could also write the kinetical energy operator as    @xmath31    writing the wavefunction as @xmath32    we arrive at three independent schrodinger equations @xmath33 in this work we only care about s wave particles , so we expand the wavefunctions in the s - wave solutions of the harmonic oscilator @xmath34 we do the same expansion to calculate the meson wavefunctions , wich we use latter to calculate the decay width",
    ". we use the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and fix the constant so that we get a mass of @xmath37 for the first radial excitation of the tetraquark , and we get the value @xmath38 .",
    "this is a standard procedure for mesons , we choose the potential constant to get the correct masses .",
    "the results are given in table [ mesonlev ] .        .",
    "masses and constant @xmath39 for different particles [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ mesonlev ]",
    "now we study the decay of the tetraquark system into a two meson system .",
    "note that the potential is different in the tetraquark and in the meson - meson channels .",
    "we assume the `` true '' potential of the system is the the flip - flop potential @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the tetraquark potential , given above , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the quark - antiquark potentials in the respective mesons , wich is of the funnel type @xmath46 the difference @xmath47 is the perturbation that causes the decay of the tetraquark into two mesons .",
    "the full hamiltonean is given by @xmath48 we could rewrite the hamiltonean as @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "now we calculate the matrix elements @xmath52 note that we need to redefine the potential so that @xmath53 .",
    "we have , also @xmath54 to compute the decay of the tetraquark in two mesons we have to solve the equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58    the term @xmath59 comes from the nonorthogonality between the tetraquark state and the meson - meson state . if the states where orthogonal the @xmath60 matrix would be the identity .",
    "we have the equations @xmath61 @xmath62    now eliminating @xmath63 we get @xmath64 where @xmath65    to calculate the decay width , we make the replacement @xmath66 in the left side of the equation and make @xmath67 in the right side .",
    "also we neglect the term @xmath68 wich corresponds to a short range iteraction between the mesons .    for the terms @xmath69 and @xmath70 we use the eq .",
    "@xmath71 for all the wavefunctions , so that @xmath69 is given by @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are polynomials .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given in terms of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , by @xmath80    for @xmath81 , we just replace the potential by @xmath82 .",
    "since the weight of the integral is gaussian , we use the monte carlo method to evaluate this nine - dimensional integral .",
    "so we calculate the width for the decay of the @xmath0 ( assuming it is a tetraquark in the @xmath83 state ) in to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and obtain ( preliminary results ) @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the result is somewhat smaller than the experimental result for the decay of the @xmath0 wich has a width of @xmath88 @xcite , but this result is only preliminary .",
    "also , we do nt include the spin effects , and it is known that the hyperfine splitting effect could increase the decay width ."
