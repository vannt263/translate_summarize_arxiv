    "the experimental results on deep inelastic charm production obtained by the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera provide a strong impetus for further theoretical studies .",
    "this process is truly semihard because of the presence of two larges scales : the virtuality of the exchanged photon ( @xmath3 ) and the charm mass ( @xmath4 ) , both being much larger than @xmath5 but much smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , in the present note , we focus on the semihard approach  @xcite ( sha ) , which we had applied earlier to the @xmath1 meson photoproduction @xcite in a similar manner .",
    "it is known that the resummation @xcite of the terms @xmath7^n,\\;$ ] @xmath8^n\\;$ ] and @xmath9^n$ ] in sha results in the so called unintegrated gluon distribution + @xmath10 , which determines the probability to find a gluon carrying the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 and transverse momentum @xmath12 at the probing scale @xmath13 .",
    "it obeys the bfkl equation  @xcite and reduces to the conventional gluon density @xmath14 once the @xmath15 dependence is integrated out : @xmath16 the factorization scale @xmath13 ( such that @xmath17 @xmath18 ) indicates the scale of the nonperturbative input distribution .",
    "the ccfm evolution equation @xcite includes coherence effects via parton angular ordering and reproduces the bfkl evolution equation in the small @xmath11 limit .",
    "therefore the ccfm unintegrated parton distribution @xmath19 ( unlike the function @xmath20 ) depends also on the maximum angle allowed for any emission corresponding to @xmath21 . in the small @xmath11 limit it reduces to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "when calculating the spin average of the matrix element squared , we substitute the full lepton tensor for the photon polarization matrix : @xmath23/(q^2)^2 \\label{epsq}\\ ] ] ( including also the photon propagator factor ) .",
    "the virtual gluon polarization matrix is taken in the form @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the 4-momenta of the incoming electron and proton .",
    "to parametrise the unintegrated structure functions , we use the prescriptions of ref .",
    "the proposed method lies upon a strai ghtforward perturbative solution of the bfkl equation where the collinear gluon density @xmath27 is used as the boundary condition in the integral form ( 1 ) .",
    "technically , the unintegrated gluon density is calculated as a convolution of the collinear gluon density with universal weight factors : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for bessel functions ( of real and imaginary arguments , respectively ) , and @xmath33 .",
    "the latter parameter is connected with the pomeron trajectory intercept : @xmath34 in the lo , and @xmath35 in the nlo approximations , respectively , where @xmath36 @xcite .    in the previous work @xcite",
    "we used the standard grv parametrization @xcite for the collinear gluon density , from which the unintegrated gluon distribution was developed according to eqs .",
    "( 4 ) - ( 6 ) .",
    "some other essential parameters were chosen as follows : the charm quark mass @xmath37  gev , the peterson fragmentation parameter @xmath38 , the overall @xmath39 fragmentation probability 0.26 .",
    "the pomeron intercept @xmath2 was regarded as free parameter , and then the value @xmath40 has been extracted from a fit to the experimental @xmath41 spectrum measured by the zeus collaboration @xcite .",
    "in this paper we also use an unintegrated gluon density coming from a solution of the ccfm evolution equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a good description of the inclusive structure function @xmath42 and the production of forward jets in dis , which are believed to be a prominent signature of small @xmath11 parton dynamics , can be obtained using the ccfm unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "in @xcite we have used the hadron level monte carlo program cascade described in @xcite to predict the cross section for @xmath43 photoproduction at hera energies .",
    "it was shown that in this case the description of the differential cross section @xmath44 for @xmath45 1 gev@xmath46 for different regions of @xmath41 is improved .",
    "the theoretical predictions on the differential cross sections of deep inelastic @xmath47 production are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] for the zeus kinematical region : @xmath48 gev@xmath46 , @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 .",
    "different curves in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] correspond to different values of the pomeron intercept parameter : @xmath2 = 0.166 ( dotted ) , 0.35 ( solid ) and 0.53 ( dashed ) . we see that the theoretical curves with @xmath51 describe all zeus experimental data @xcite on the differential cross sections , except the @xmath44 distribution . the sha calculations with bfkl unintegrated gluon distribution show some shift to negative @xmath52 with respect to the data .",
    "this descrepancy between the data and the sha prediction could result from the use of the peterson fragmentation function .",
    "another reason may be connected with the bfkl lo unitegrated gluon density .",
    ", ccfm scheme with peterson fragmentation.[fig : fig2 ] ]    , ccfm sheme with jetset fragmentation.[fig : fig3 ] ]    the use of ccfm unintegrated gluon density ( with angular ordering ) from mc generator cascade @xcite with the peterson fragmentation function for @xmath53 transition gives some positive shift to the @xmath44 distribution ( figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ) compared to bfkl curve ( see figure  [ fig : fig1]e ) . finally , when we use the ccfm unintegrated gluon distribution with more realistic jetset based fragmentation function  @xcite implemented in @xcite we obtain good agreement between our theoretical results and the zeus experimental data @xcite for @xmath44 ( figure  [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
