    "the study of particles performing brownian motion in a periodic potential constitutes a hallmark example of stochastic particle dynamics with important applications in various branches of science and technology .",
    "perhaps the most common application of periodic brownian motion is the diffusive dynamics of atoms and molecules on crystal surfaces @xcite .",
    "surface diffusion is among the most important mechanisms that controls processes such as island nucleation and subsequent surface growth .",
    "it has been shown that by controlling the mobility of particles on the surface by external means , such as an ac or dc electric field , allows morphological control over the growing surfaces @xcite .",
    "it is thus of great interest to model periodic brownian motion with static and time - dependent external fields .    to this end",
    ", there have been several studies reporting the diffusion of a single brownian particle in a periodic potential with external ac bias applied @xcite .",
    "the case of a dimer consisting of two connected particles has also been considered @xcite , in which case there s an additional length scale in the problem , namely the dimer bond length , as shown schematically in fig",
    "most of the studies reporting the behavior of brownian particles discuss the influence of an oscillating bias on transport coefficients .",
    "the central issue here is existence of a stochastic resonance ( sr ) , which can greatly enhance the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 in 2d @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown in the case of 1d periodic potentials that although the local jump rate of particles can be enhanced , there is no true sr in the hydrodynamic limit @xcite .    , the lattice constant @xmath1 and the dimer bond length @xmath2 .",
    "the details of an external bias are discussed in the text.,width=264,height=188 ]    an interesting limit of the periodic brownian motion is where the energy barrier @xmath3 is much larger than the thermal energy , _",
    "@xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 the temperature ( cf .",
    "1 ) . since brownian motion",
    "is activated by thermal fluctuations , the diffusion rate is proportional to @xmath8 which becomes very small at low temperatures . to overcome this rare event problem in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations ,",
    "voter @xcite has proposed the so - called hyperdynamics ( hd ) scheme , which involves accelerating the dynamics by adding proper bias potential , which effectively lowers the barrier height .",
    "the dynamics is then corrected based on the approximate transition state theory ( tst ) . there",
    "exist various approaches to the choice of the bias potential , and some examples can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , recently a new scheme has been proposed that is based on the mapping of the stochastic langevin equation to a path integral form @xcite . unlike the standard hd scheme , this so - called stochastic path integral hyperdynamics ( sphd ) method allows an _ exact _ correction of the dynamics by resampling the simulated paths . in other words , this method is not restricted to the tst approximation .",
    "further , it is not restricted to static energy barriers ; both entropic barriers and even time - dependent bias can be employed .",
    "this allows an efficient way to overcome the large barrier problem , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "however , the sphd method is not limited to the case of high barriers . since in principle",
    "any external bias force can be used , it should be possible to obtain results for _ many different bias values _ from running ld simulations with a single value of the bias force , or even without such a force if need be . to demonstrate this , in this work we have undertaken to employ the sphd method to study periodic brownian motion for two interesting cases . in the first case",
    ", we consider the diffusion of a single brownian particle in a 1d periodic potential with ac forcing .",
    "the second case is that of a dimer diffusing in a 1d periodic potential with a static bias . for both cases ,",
    "we show how the sphd method can be efficiently employed to obtain the transport coefficients for a range of different external forcing terms from single simulation runs .",
    "brownian motion of a single particle can be represented by the langevin equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the position of the particle ( of unit mass m ) at time t , moving under the influence of external force @xmath11 and the random noise term @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the friction coefficient . in general , to accelerate the dynamics one must add a bias force @xmath16 to the langevin equation to get @xmath17 with an appropriately chosen bias potential , the dynamics of the system evolves much faster than in the original langevin equation .",
    "the dynamics given by numerically solving eq .",
    "( 2 ) is fictitious , of course .",
    "however , the use of path integral formalism allows an exact compensation of the effect of adding the bias force by defining an effective action functional @xmath18 @xcite @xmath19\\delta t.\\ ] ] this expression constitutes time integration for a given realization of the random noise force @xmath20 along a given trajectory @xmath10 . to recover true dynamics in the absence of @xmath16",
    ", one has to estimate the sphd statistical weight factor @xmath21 and simply use it to re - weight every sampled trajectory .",
    "the fundamental quantity associated with brownian dynamics is the single - particle ( tracer ) diffusion coefficient @xcite , which can be defined through the mean square displacement ( msd ) of the tracer particle as @xmath22^{2 } \\rangle.\\ ] ] when studying particle diffusion the mean square displacement ( msd ) at zero bias ( true dynamics ) can be obtained by running sphd with a bias , calculating @xmath18 along every trajectory and re - weighting as @xmath23_{0}^{2}\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left[r(0)-r(t)\\right]_{\\mathit{hd}}^{2}e^{-\\beta i_{\\xi } } \\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath24 and _ hd _ correspond to the quantities with zero bias ( true dynamics ) and finite bias , respectively .",
    "the sphd has an additional powerful feature which can be seen from the biased langevin equation and the expression for the re - weighting factor @xmath18 .",
    "it is possible to obtain the true dynamics for _ any _ value of the bias force @xmath25 by estimating @xmath26 corresponding to some @xmath27 . with this",
    ", the true dynamics at multiple bias levels ( @xmath27 ) can be extracted , simultaneously , from a single simulation run of biased dynamics according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) and estimating the weight factors , corresponding to multiple values of @xmath27 along all the trajectories .",
    "the first case where we consider the application of the sphd method is that of a brownian particle in a one - dimensional spatially periodic potential with an external , time - dependent ac driving force @xcite .",
    "for such a system , the equation of motion is given by @xmath28 where the second term on the right hand side indicates an ac driving force with amplitude @xmath29 and frequency @xmath30 .",
    "the diffusion of a brownian particle can be studied with respect to various values of these two parameters .",

    ", it appears that large values of amplitude @xmath43 lead to a lower @xmath0 than small values of @xmath43 .",
    "it seems that the ac bias for higher values of both @xmath43 and @xmath47 acts detrimental to activation in the diffusive motion . this feature can be effectively used to localize the motion of the particle .",
    "it is of interest to compare the sphd with direct simulations for the langevin equation . in this case , a larger time step of @xmath48 was sufficient , and averages were taken over @xmath45 trajectories . in table",

    "@xcite that this enhancement exactly cancels out in the hydrodynamic limit for a 1d periodic potential such as used in the present study .",

    "the fene parameters are @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the periodicity of the 1d potential was changed between @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and the tilt parameters were @xmath83 .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient was estimated by using the relation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the center of mass of the dimer , in order to subtract the drift term caused by @xmath86 .",
    "_ vs. _ the wavelength @xmath87 for various tilts .",
    "error bars are of the order of the size of the symbols , or smaller .",
    "the solid lines are just guide to an eye and contain no other significance.,width=264,height=188 ]    in fig .",
    "3 we summarize our results for @xmath0 as a function of the wavelength of the periodic potential for three tilt values . for the case of a dimer , there are now two relevant length scales in the system ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : the zero temperature equilibrium bond length of the dimer @xmath88 and the wavelength @xmath89 of the underlying periodic potential . thus , for the dimer motion there s a matching of the two lengths when the ratio @xmath90 is an integer . on the other hand ,",
    "when this ratio is a half - integer , there s strong competition between the dimer bond and potential energy . in the latter case",
    ", it should be easier for the dimer to escape as the effective diffusion barrier is lower .",
    "indeed , as seen in fig .",
    "3 we find that for every value of the tilt there is a strong decrease in @xmath0 in the vicinity of the first matching condition @xmath91 @xcite . on the other hand , near @xmath92",
    "there is a local maximum in @xmath0 , as expected , followed by another pronounced minimum near @xmath93 . in our model ,",
    "the interaction between the monomers is highly anharmonic .",
    "this results in an equilibrium dimer separation which is temperature dependent and the first minimum in d in fig.3 is shifted from the zero temperature value @xmath94 to @xmath95 . a finite tilt increases the overall magnitude of @xmath0 while its non - monotonic behavior as a function of @xmath87 prevails almost unchanged .",
    "our results are consistent with the langevin dynamics studies of bammert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who considered dimer diffusion in a 2d periodic square potential ( with a hydrodynamic interaction term included ) and found that there s a local maximum in @xmath0 for @xmath92 .",
    "@xcite have reported dimer diffusion on a 1d washboard - like potential , and they also find a flat minimum at @xmath91 for small tilts .",
    "another interesting feature in our results is that the minima in @xmath0 deepen with increasing @xmath96 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "when the matching condition is met ( _ i.e. _ @xmath96 is an integer ) , both beads in the dimer can sit exactly at the minima of the potential separated by @xmath97 minima .",
    "the elementary diffusion move of the dimer ( local jump rate ) consists of both of the beads crossing the saddle points ( potential maxima ) synchronously ( assuming that bond fluctuations can be neglected ) . for every @xmath96",
    "the effective diffusion barrier is exactly the same independent of @xmath96 .",
    "however , the jump length of the dimer depends on @xmath96 ( in units of @xmath98 ) such that the distance the dimer moves is given by @xmath99 . thus , if we use the dynamical mean field theory to approximate the diffusion coefficient @xcite , the prefactor of @xmath0 is proportional to the jump length squared , which gives @xmath100 we have analysed the data upto around @xmath101 and checked that minima of @xmath0 near integer values of @xmath87 indeed decreases with increasing @xmath96 , but slower than predicted by eq .",
    "( 12 ) for the present set of parameters .",
    "indeed , eq . ( 12 ) strictly holds only in the limit of a rigid dimer bond and @xmath102 , which is not in the range of the parameters used here .    in analogy to the single particle case ,",
    "we have compared our results from the sphd scheme to data obtained from directly integrating the langevin equation with the static bias for the largest value of the tilt @xmath103 , for various values of @xmath89 .",
    "for the straight ld simulations @xmath104 and averages were taken over @xmath105 trajectories .",
    "there is again good agreement between these two sets of data .",
    "an intriguing further extension of the sphd method is extrapolation with more than one bias force parameter . in the present case",
    ", we did some test runs by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( 8) corresponding to a flat surface _ and _ zero static bias ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the dynamics along tilted periodic potentials was recovered by setting @xmath107 $ ] , and we used the same parameters as in the single - parameter resampling case .",
    "we found that using @xmath45 trajectories the discrepancies with respect to the data in table ii were about 16 % at largest .",
    "this is due to the fact that when simulations are run on a smooth surface , all trajectories of the dimer are weighted equally .",
    "however , in the actual periodic potential the main contribution to the diffusion coefficient comes from paths crossing the saddle point from one minimum to another .",
    "thus , in the resampling procedure most of the paths are not relevant for determining the value of @xmath0 , and thus the errors remain relatively large even with @xmath45 paths for the present case .",

    "in this work , we have employed the recently proposed sphd scheme to study the diffusive motion of brownian particles in periodic potentials in 1d . unlike the hd schemes proposed so far",
    ", the sphd scheme allows an exact correction of the biased dynamics based on reweighing of all the transition paths .",
    "there s also no restriction for the type of bias potential used , and thus the sphd method can be used to extrapolate results to _ multiple _ values of the bias force from a single simulation run , as shown by the two cases we have studied here : time - dependent forcing for a single brownian particle and constant forcing for a brownian dimer . for a brownian particle in an external ac bias , our results are in agreement with previous studies and show that there s no stochastic resonance in this system . for the second case of a dimer moving in a periodic potential with a static bias we find a strong suppression of @xmath0 when the dimer bond length is an integer multiple of the lattice constant of the potential",
    ". this suppression is weakened by an applied dc bias .",
    "our work demonstrates how external forcing can be used to control particle mobilities in periodic potentials .",
