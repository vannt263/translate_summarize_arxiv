    "the authors [ 1 ] have studied cooper pairs breaking process by comparison of level density in threes of isotopes with the neutron number @xmath4 .",
    "the confidence level in determination of nuclear specific heat is fully stipulated by reliability of the observed level density .",
    "this nuclear parameter obtained from intensities of two - step cascades has considerably higher reliability than that obtained within known methods due to unsuccessful relation between the experimental spectra and desired parameters of the gamma - decay process .",
    "the data needed for the analysis [ 1 ] can be obtained now , for example , for three compound nuclei @xmath5ba and @xmath6 .",
    "analysis method [ 2 ] of a bulk of the information on the two - step cascades , developed in dubna without using any the model notions of level density @xmath7 and radiative strength functions @xmath8 , showed that these data can not be reproduced without the  step - like \" structure in level density and corresponding deviations of @xmath8 from the simple model dependencies . for the fist time , the possibility of the  step - like \" structures in the level density and corresponding thermodynamic characteristics of a nucleus was pointed out in [ 3 ] .",
    "using our experimental data on cascade @xmath1-transitions from the @xmath2ba@xmath0 [ 4 ] and @xmath9dy@xmath0 [ 5 ] reactions we determined [ 6 ] the dependence of the two - step cascade intensity @xmath10 on the primary transition energy @xmath11 for these nuclei ( it is shown in fig .  1 ) , and also level density @xmath7 and radiative strength functions @xmath12 which allow us to reproduce @xmath10 with practically zero deviation from the experiment for both nuclei . the most considerable errors of procedure [ 6 ] of decomposition of the experimental spectrum into two components corresponding to solely primary transitions and solely secondary transitions - leads only to re - distribution of cascade intensities between the different intervals of the primary transition energies .",
    "in the first approach , magnitude of this error is inversely proportional to the number of cascades registered in the experiment .",
    "it increases also with increasing a number of background events .",
    "although efficiency of the spectrometer used in the experiment [ 4,5 ] was small enough , rather specific form of energy dependence of the cascade intensity ( considerable concentration of @xmath13 at the energy of their intermediate levels @xmath14 for @xmath3dy ) decreases the influence of systematical uncertainties of the procedure [ 6 ] for the primary transitions of cascades with the energy @xmath15 mev . in practice , this can increase cascade intensity for @xmath16 mev not more than by 20 - 30% and , respectively , decrease it in the same measure in the region @xmath17 mev .    in case of @xmath3dy ,",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath8 data obtained from analysis [ 2 ] are slightly misrepresented .",
    "but the use of the method [ 6 ] does not change the total cascade intensity in the @xmath18 mev interval .",
    "namely , considerable exceeding of experimental intensity at high enough nuclear excitation @xmath19 above the calculation in the framework fermi - gas [ 7 ] model of level density or any other notions ( which provide exponential energy dependence of level density in the interval from 1 - 2 mev and @xmath20 ) gives  step - like \" structure in energy dependence of level density . as a consequence ,",
    "this systematical error leads , in practice , to insignificant variation in values of the desired parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "just this circumstance allow us to get the data on the level density and radiative strength functions with relatively small systematic errors .",
    "additional error can result from systematic errors of intensities of the cascade high - energy primary gamma - transitions which are used for normalization of @xmath13 .",
    "intensities [ 5 ] used for this aim are about 25% less than the modern values [ 9 ] .",
    "so , one can summarize that all the known ordinary systematic errors can not decrease the presented below experimental level density at least at the excitation energy @xmath21 mev .",
    "such systematical error can not explain the difference between experimental and calculated data in @xmath2ba even in principle also .",
    "level density and radiative strength functions of @xmath22 and @xmath23 cascade transitions , which allow simultaneous reproduction of cascade intensity @xmath10 ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "the mean value of the total radiative width @xmath24 and 57 mev [ 10 ] of neutron resonances in @xmath25ba and @xmath9dy correspondly , are shown in figs .  2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "it was established experimentally in first time now [ 12 ] that the ratio @xmath26 of strength functions for transitions with equal energy and multipolarity but depopulating levels with significantly different excitation energy strongly depends on @xmath27 .",
    "this must lead to significant discrepancy between the calculated and experimental single spectra of cascade gamma - decay of any nuclei and to noticeably less discrepancy in the case of intensities of two - step cascades to the most low - lying levels .",
    "this is due to the sign - variable variation of energy dependence of strength functions @xmath28 of the secondary transitions with respect to @xmath29 for the primary transitions .",
    "such variations influence corresponding @xmath13 values only through the considerably less change in the total radiative strength of the cascade intermediate levels .",
    "but even in this case , the errors in parameters can exceed the width of the interval of probable values @xmath7 and @xmath8 providing precise description of the experimental cascade intensities .    the use of cascade population of the large enough set of cascade intermediate levels with rather high maximum excitation energy provides , to the first approach , accounting [ 12 ] for the dependence @xmath28 .",
    "corresponding results for population by cascades and primary transitions of such set of levels are shown in fig .  4 ,",
    "the lower estimates of cascade populations summed over the 200 kev energy bins are shown in fig .",
    "the last data can be added to the set of experimental data using for extraction [ 2 ] of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this provides as low as possible error in determination of the parameters to be found .    as in other",
    "studied even - odd nuclei , level density in @xmath2ba @xmath3dy in the excitation interval from @xmath30 to @xmath31 mev also is considerably less than that predicted according to [ 7 ] .",
    "theoretical basis for qualitative explanation of such energy dependence was obtained in [ 3 ] . in accordance with the main idea by a.v .",
    "ignatyuk and yu.v .",
    "sokolov , quasi - particle level density is the sum of level densities with 1 , 3 , 5 ... quasi - particles for even - odd nuclei . in the interval between the energies of breaking of corresponding cooper pairs , level density changes very weakly , at least for some first broken pair . and energy of a nucleus",
    ", most probably , is passed to excitation of its vibrations .",
    "the only correction which is necessary to achieve well agreement between the experiment and calculation [ 3 ] is the shift of the energy of appearance of 3 quasi - particles to the higher value by about 1 mev .",
    "enhancement of the radiative strength functions , caused by strong correlations of @xmath8 and @xmath7 , most probably , relates with the change in ratio between the quasi - particle and collective components of the wave functions of the cascade intermediate levels in the region of most strong change in their density .",
    "method [ 2 ] does not allow one , even in principle , to get unique values of the level density and radiative strength functions even in that case when experimental cascade intensities do not contain systematical and statistical errors .",
    "modeling of this situation shows that their asymptotical uncertainty for the available experimental data can not be less than @xmath32 .",
