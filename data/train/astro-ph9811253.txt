    "using the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , lu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) measured the column density of sii toward hvc187 , using the seyfert galaxy ngc3783 as a background probe .",
    "this object is one of the main extreme - positive - velocity clouds , defined by wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) . using the  column density derived from the data discussed here ,",
    "the sulphur abundance was found to be 0.25@xmath50.07 solar , similar to the value in the magellanic clouds . combining this with the tidal model of gardiner & noguchi ( 1996 ) , lu et al .",
    "concluded that the hvc is part of the leading arm of the magellanic system , implying a distance of 1050kpc .",
    "here we present the  data used to derive the  column density .",
    "observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) were done in june 1994 and march / june 1995 , with a resolution of 60x38 .",
    "the primary beam had an fwhm of 337 . for calibration , mapping and analysis",
    "the miriad software package was used .",
    "cleaning was done using the multi - resolution clean ( wakker & schwarz 1987 ) .",
    "the atca data were combined with data from the parkes multibeam survey ( staveley - smith 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the parkes map of hvc187 .",
    "other hvcs , with velocities of about + 100km / s , are present in this same region ( complex  wd ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the total column density map of hvc287 + 22 + 240 , based on combining atca and parkes data .",
    "these maps were created by first summing all interferometer channels , applying a mask .",
    "the mask was created by using a 3-sigma cutoff in a map smoothed to double the beam , so that pixels with low s / n ratio could be eliminated .",
    "the summed maps were then corrected for primary beam attenuation , converted to brightness temperature , and integrated over velocity . finally , the two fields were combined .",
    "next , the interferometer and single - dish maps were combined following the method described by schwarz & wakker ( 1991 ) .",
    "this consists of smoothing the primary - beam corrected interferometer map to the single - dish beam and subtracting the result from the single - dish map to find the emission that was filtered out by the lack of short interferometer baselines .",
    "adding back the cleaned interferometer map gives the final map .",
    "the resulting map shows the presence of structure at scales of 1 arcmin . smoothing decreases the apparent column density in the concentrations , indicating that they are not fully resolved . as is usual for high - velocity cloud cores",
    "the simple structure seen at @xmath620  resolution resolves into many scattered cores .",
    "figure 3 shows spectra toward the six brightest continuum sources in the field .",
    "these spectra were made using the method described by wakker et al.(1991 ) , using only baselines longer than 180 m .",
    "the profiles were extracted , converted to brightness temperature , corrected for primary beam attenuation , and hanning smoothed over 5 points .",
    "table  1 collects the measurements .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath7 follows from the  emission ( @xmath8 ) and the optical depth of the absorption ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 .",
    "we included in @xmath8 a @xmath02k contribution from a smooth background ( filtered out by the interferometer ) .",

    "linewidths are 510km / s , increasing slightly with resolution due to beam - smearing of velocity gradients .",
    "the components with more extreme velocities tend to occur away from the brightest core at 11@xmath1739@xmath18 , @xmath153815 . in low resolution single - dish spectra",
    "this would show up as a broadening of the line profiles away from the core . assuming that the line - of - sight density profile is gaussian , combining the angular diameter ( @xmath19 ) , distance ( d ) and column density ( n@xmath20 ) of a concentration yields the volume density : @xmath21 d ) .",

    "these pressures represent the combined thermal and `` turbulent '' pressure of the ( presumably ) cool  cores .
