    "low dimensional systems have been the subject of increasing interest over the past decades , traditionally in condensed - matter physics , and recently in the framework of quantum gases .",
    "there , recent advances in atom waveguide technology @xcite , the realization of quantum gases in very anisotropic traps @xcite and loading bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) on optical lattices @xcite , allowed experimentalists to obtain a rich variety of systems where the reduced dimensionality rules the physics .",
    "particularly interesting is the case in which the quantum dynamics of the system becomes quasi - one - dimensional . in that case",
    "it was shown @xcite that in certain regimes of large scattering length , low densities , and low temperatures , bosons behave as impenetrable particles known as hard - core bosons ( hcb s ) .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) homogeneous gas of hcb s was introduced by girardeau @xcite , and a one - to - one correspondence between 1d hcb s and spinless fermions was established .",
    "it was shown later by lenard and by vaidya and tracy @xcite that in homogeneous space , the 1d hcb gas does not exhibit true condensation at zero temperature since there is only off - diagonal quasi - long - range order ( one - particle correlations decay as a power law ) , leading to an occupation of the lowest effective single - particle state ( the highest occupied one ) @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the total number of hcb s .",
    "recently , theoretical studies have been focused on the ground - state properties of 1d hcb gases in the presence of harmonic potentials @xcite , which are required in the experiments with quantum gases to keep the particles confined . using the fermi - bose mapping , quantities like density profiles , momentum profiles ,",
    "the natural orbitals ( effective single - particle states ) , and the one - particle density matrix have been calculated for a finite number of particles .",
    "some results were extended to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been found that similarly to the homogeneous case the occupation of the lowest natural orbital is @xmath3 @xcite , so that only a quasicondensate develops in the trap .",
    "another case of interest is given by hcb s on a lattice .",
    "these systems have been realized experimentally very recently @xcite . in the periodic case , the 1d hcb hamiltonian can be mapped into the 1d @xmath4 model of lieb , schulz , and mattis @xcite .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in the literature . at zero temperature the asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions",
    "is known @xcite . in the presence of a confining potential , the systems realized experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , the situation is more complicated .",
    "this is because the trapping potential is equivalent to the addition of a space - varying transverse field to the @xmath4 hamiltonian , for which in general analytical results are not available .    in this work",
    "we study ground - state properties of 1d trapped hcb s in a lattice .",
    "the lattice opens new possibilities for engineering states that can not be obtained in continuous systems .",
    "in particular , for hcb s it is possible to create pure fock states when the occupation in some regions of the system reaches the value @xmath5 , such that coherence is lost there , and these sites decouple from the rest of the system . in addition , the properties of the systems without the lattice can be recovered in the low - density limit in a lattice .",
    "we follow a numerical approach , based on the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , that allows us to calculate exactly the one - particle green s function and analyze arbitrary confining potentials .",
    "this approach was recently introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to study ground - state properties , and generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite for the study of the nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "we concentrate here on the behavior of the off - diagonal part of the one - particle density matrix , the momentum distribution function , and the natural orbitals .",
    "these quantities have a different behavior for hcb s when compared with spinless fermions to which the hcb hamiltonian is mapped by means of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "we find that the one - particle density matrix @xmath6 decays as a power law @xmath7 for large distances , like in the periodic case @xcite , irrespective of the confining potential chosen .",
    "this is valid even when portions of the system reach occupation @xmath8 , such that coherence is lost there .",
    "the power law above is shown to determine the scaling of the occupation of the lowest natural orbital in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this scaling and its finite - size corrections are also studied for arbitrary powers of the confining potential .",
    "in addition , the low - density limit in the lattice is analyzed in detail and the results obtained are compared with the ones presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for continuous systems .",

    "we have shown how the results for the occupation of the lowest natural orbitals in continuous systems can be obtained as an extrapolation in a lattice .",
    "the only input knowledge ones needs to do this extrapolation is the behavior of the ratio between the level spacing and the bandwidth for the lowest energy levels as a function of the strength of the confining potential ."
