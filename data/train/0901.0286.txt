    "the energy budget of momentum driven winds remains roughly 20% of the total sn energy assuming a chabrier imf ( fourth panel ) .",
    "high-@xmath17 winds require substantial energy input , but the wind speeds are relatively mild compared to low-@xmath17 outflows from lirgs and ulirgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as before , we find that substantial mass ejection is a key feature of our wind model : the amount of material ejected at these epochs is many times that which forms into stars .",
    "one reason why enriching the igm is easier at high-@xmath17 is that the physical scale of the universe is small .",
    "od08 showed that in our wind model , winds propagate a similar physical distance ( @xmath145  kpc ) for all redshifts and galaxy masses ; the comoving volume a galaxy can enrich therefore goes as @xmath146 .",
    "figure [ fig : rho_z ] illustrates the rapid growth of metallicity at igm overdensities from @xmath6 .",
    "the gradually rising @xmath147 trend in place at all four redshifts is one of the defining signatures of the momentum - driven wind enrichment .",
    "in contrast , a wind model with constant @xmath66  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will create a flatter metallicity - density relationship with either a sharp drop - off at lower overdensity ( cf .",
    "figure 10 of od06 ) or a rise in metallicity if superwinds are even stronger ( cf .",

    "the cumulative volume filling factors of metals in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : rho_z ] show this , as even regions with @xmath154 fill only about 1% of the simulation volume at @xmath14 . filling factors increase only modestly to lower @xmath17 ( od08 ) , which is somewhat remarkable given that these models can match most available igm metal - line data .",
    "hence the presence of diffuse igm metal absorbers does not necessarily indicate widespread metal distribution .",
    "we will return to this point , and the inhomogeneous enrichment it implies , later .",
    "regions of galactic overdensities ( @xmath155 ) are generally enriched rapidly to @xmath156 or higher .",
    "the metallicity does not grow much at such overdensities , which is reflected in the lack of predicted evolution in the mass - metallicity relation from @xmath157 in dfo08 ( see their figure 5 ) .",
    "the fraction of cosmic volume enriched to @xmath158 is 0.01 - 0.02% , which is actually a factor of 1.5 - 3@xmath135 _ higher _ than that at @xmath159  @xcite .",
    "it is astounding to consider that the volume fraction of the universe enriched to around solar metallicity may change very little between @xmath160 ; the key difference is the corresponding regions at low redshift contain orders of magnitude more baryons .",
    "this is a result of our momentum - driven wind model based on locally observed outflows .",
    "@xcite showed these winds efficiently enrich igm overdensities at high-@xmath17 , some to @xmath161 , while by @xmath162 most of these metals recycle back into galactic environments and later winds often can not escape out of galactic haloes ( od08 ) .",
    "many of the trends noted above can be seen in figure  [ fig : snaps60 ] , which shows the locations of galaxies in the upper left and the metallicity - density distribution in the upper right in a 25 @xmath163-thick slice extending across the d16n512vzw simulation box .",
    "gray indicates zero metallicity in these frames , which corresponds to the vast majority of the igm , and shows the nascent cosmic web .",
    "most of the volume remains unenriched at these redshifts , while regions within early galaxies become enriched up to a tenth solar or more .",
    "clustering between early galaxies and enriched portions of the igm is strong .",
    "this illustrates that the galaxy - absorber connection at high-@xmath17 is extremely tight , as we investigate further in ",
    "[ sec : galabs ] .",
    "to make predictions for observable metal - line absorbers , we must obtain ionization corrections for relevant metal ions .",
    "this requires that we have a model for the photo - ionization rate at each point in the simulation volume .",
    "ideally , we would like to self - consistently track the local ionization spectrum in these simulations . but this must await a full time - dependent , non - equilibrium radiative transfer implementation , which we are in the process of developing @xcite but do not yet have .",
    "hence for this work , we will consider three ad hoc cases for the ionization background ( dubbed _ no field , hm2001 , _ and _ bubble _ ) that span a plausible range .",
    "note that our simulations are originally run with a uniform @xcite ionizing background , and we are only imposing these backgrounds in post - processing .",
    "this obviously does not properly capture the dynamical effects of different pressure forces in our three cases .",
    "however , since dark matter is dynamically dominant in the relatively low - density regions giving rise to igm absorbers , post - processing the background to obtain ionization corrections is a good approximation .      *",
    "no field : * our first case assumes a fully neutral igm , where no ionizing background exists at wavelengths below the lyman limit , while lower energy photons stream freely . this extreme case may be applicable if metal injection precedes ionization fronts , or more realistically if the igm recombines in regions enriched and ionized at earlier times .",
    "oxygen remains in its ground state due to the @xmath3 ionization potential ( 13.618 ev ) being barely higher than the @xmath43 ionization potential , while @xmath164 ( 11.260 ev ) and @xmath165 ( 8.151 ev ) are completely ionized to the second level . +",
    "* hm2001 : * our second case assumes reionization is complete and a spatially - uniform background applies everywhere .",
    "we use the @xcite background assuming a contribution from quasars and 10% of photons above the lyman limit from star forming galaxies generated by their cosmic ultraviolet background ( cuba ) program ; at @xmath23 , star - forming galaxies dominate the ionizing flux .",
    "we divide the total flux by a factor of 1.6 as we did in od06 in order to match the summed flux decrement of the @xmath44 forest down to @xmath166 .",
    "an assumption of a spatially - uniform ionization background is probably far from correct at @xmath23 , but this is intended to represent another extreme case like _ no field_. ionization fractions for metal lines are calculated using cloudy - generated @xcite ionization tables as a function of density and temperature , as described in od06 . + * bubble : * the last case assumes that the ionizing flux of the nearest galaxy dominates , which may be the most realistic scenario during reionization .",
    "this is applicable if metals remain near enough to their parent galaxies to be dominated by the local ionizing intensity , which we will show is often true since metals typically reside within 30  kpc of the originating galaxy .",
    "of course , detailed radiative transfer effects of escaping ionization and subsequent recombinations will play a critical role , so this scenario should be considered a crude proxy for a patchy reionization model .    to implement the _ bubble _ field , we consider the ionizing field from only the nearest galaxy , weighted by the inverse square law .",
    "we assume an average sed per stellar mass by taking the average @xcite stellar synthesis spectrum of _ all _ the stars in the simulation box for a given redshift , accounting for their ages and metallicities .",
    "we then calculate the impinging flux using the stellar mass and distance of the nearest galaxy , which is identified for each sph particle .",
    "note that the same ionizing flux per unit stellar mass is assumed to emanate from each galaxy at a given epoch ; we do not account for variations in nearest galaxy seds , which is another approximation required to make the problem computationally tractable .",
    "we attenuate the emission from galaxies by dust extinction .",
    "the assumed extinction has a fixed value of @xmath121 , as shown in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] to broadly match the observed rest - uv lf . to calculate how the emergent sed is attenuated",
    ", we use the theoretical dust absorption curve from the x - ray to the far - ir of @xcite , using their grain size distribution of silicate and carbonaceous grains found to fit the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) bar .",
    "we use this curve because @xmath167 lbgs exhibit the smaller grain size distributions of smc - like dust @xcite .",
    "note that we can not directly apply the empirical @xcite extinction law because it extends only down to 1200  , while we are especially interested in the attenuation at energies where @xmath2 and @xmath5 are ionized ( i.e. @xmath168  ) .",
    "for each sph particle , the impinging flux is then the dust - attenuated emission divided by the distance from the nearest galaxy squared .",
    "we then use cloudy to generate the resulting metal ionization fractions , which is then used to obtain the optical depth for any ion along the los as described in od06 .",
    "we plot the _",
    "hm2001 _ field at @xmath130 and 6 in figure [ fig : ionbkgd ] , along with the _ bubble _ field , where we assume a @xmath169 galaxy at 10 kpc ( typical values ) for concreteness .",
    "the difference between the solid and dotted orange lines for the _ bubble _ case at @xmath54 illustrates the effects of dust attenuation .",
    "dust absorption in all of the @xcite models sharply peaks at 600 - 900 , causing a dip .",
    "there is a clear lyman break , which in our cases arises mostly from stellar atmospheres , and secondarily from dust .",
    "we note that this break is not nearly as strong as that observed by @xcite in lyman break galaxies at @xmath167 , perhaps indicating that there is a fairly small escape fraction of ionizing photons ; for instance , @xcite assume a global 10% escape fraction .",
    "however , because these data are from lower-@xmath17 and higher-@xmath100 galaxies , it may not be applicable here . for simplicity , we do not assume an overall escape fraction .",

    "this is mostly because our typical galaxy is younger and more metal - poor than that assumed by @xcite ( @xmath172 , 0.5 gyrs ) , which leads to a harder ionizing source .",
    "two secondary reasons for greater hardness are : ( i ) the _ bubble _ lyman - break attenuation due to dust is less than the _",
    "attenuation applied ( @xmath173 vs. an overall 10% escape fraction ) ; and ( ii ) the dust attenuation declines at the ionization potentials of @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( shown ) .",

    "the _ no field _ case is straightforward ( i.e. ionization fractions of unity for @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) , but the often nuanced behavior of the other two fields has some perhaps unexpected consequences .",

    "@xcite suggests this could be an explanation for the strong evolution they find in @xmath15 ( @xmath299 increase between @xmath26 and @xmath300 ) if @xmath171 reionization proceeds over this redshift range , increasing @xmath176 ionizing radiation , and resulting in a lower ionization correction for @xmath2 at @xmath301 .",
    "* wind model : * while we have investigated a plausible wind model for enriching the igm , based on momentum - driven wind scalings , this may not be the only possible outflow scenario that can reproduce observations .",
    "varying wind speeds and mass loading factors in od06 led us to some useful intuition when compared to @xmath2 absorption data : too high wind speeds overheat the igm while too low wind speeds do not sufficiently enrich filaments ; also , too high mass loading suppresses sf so much that too few metals are produced while too low mass loading results in insufficient metals in the igm .",
    "but while constraints at @xmath302 are fairly tight , at higher @xmath17 the possibility of more exotic processes such as pop iii stars or the lack of dust may impart fundamental changes to outflows . without a more detailed physical understanding of the physics of outflow driving ,",
    "it is difficult to ascertain the systematic uncertainties in our wind model .    * mini - halos and population  iii stars : * the very first stars and galaxies are not resolved in our simulation , as they likely form within mini - halos having virial temperatures below @xmath303k  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if such systems dominate the early enrichment or ionization budget , our modeling will be incomplete .",
    "however , @xcite suggests that they do not dominate the ionization budget , and @xcite estimated that they increase the global gas metallicity by only @xmath304 , which is @xmath305 less than the global gas metallicity at @xmath54 in our simulations .",
    "hence unless they have much higher yields than expected , it seems unlikely that metal production in mini - halos should be important at @xmath45 .",
    "* unresolved galaxies : * for galaxies in halos with virial temperatures above @xmath303k , our simulation nearly resolves the jeans mass at @xmath306 . using the formula for jeans length from  6 of od06 , we find a jeans mass of @xmath307 at @xmath308 assuming @xmath309 and @xmath180k , which is nearly the dynamical mass limit of a resolved galaxy in our simulation .",
    "the flattening of the stellar mass function at @xmath310 reflects the effect of the photoionization of regions containing forming galaxies ( i.e. the filtering mass ) .",

    "we use the yields of @xcite , which do not change much at low-@xmath60 for carbon . in our simulations",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which if true means our simulations are over - mixing metals .",
    "integrating the carbon yields over the various stellar imfs listed in table [ table : yields ] does indicate as much as a factor of two difference with the yields we use at the higher end .",
    "note also that the yields calculated by @xcite for rotating stars at solar metallicity can more than double the total carbon yield versus non - rotating models .",
    "* initial mass function : * even if metal - free stars are unimportant , it is possible that there is an overall shift towards a more top - heavy imf at high redshifts .",

    "hence to first order the amount of carbon produced will be correct . but",
    "depending on the nature and form of an imf variation , it remains possible that the overall carbon yield per unit high - mass sf could still vary somewhat .",
    "as an example , the @xcite yields using a contribution only from 30 - 120 @xmath314 stars produces half as much carbon as the @xcite yields ( table [ table : yields ] ) .",
    "* cosmological parameters : * given the uncertainties on cosmological parameters in the 5-year wmap results @xcite , the measurement of @xmath86 ( @xmath315 ) imparts the greatest uncertainty in regards to high-@xmath17 sf . as mentioned in ",

    "similarly , we find @xmath316 fewer @xmath54 stars in a @xmath317 @xmath318 test run where we reduce @xmath86 from 0.83 to 0.75 holding all other parameters constant .",
    "given the error bars on @xmath86 , a factor of two difference in sf and chemical nucleosynthesis at @xmath319 is possible , which will lead to similar uncertainty in @xmath15 if the metals are injected into the igm the same way .",
    "this is the main reason why the d - series results in a larger increase in @xmath15 from @xmath320 compared to the published w - series predictions in od06 .    to summarize , a number of possibilities exist to alter @xmath15 by a factor of a couple .",
    "an important constraint is the number of weaker lines ( @xmath321 ) , which our models may be over - predicting given the comparison to the largest sample from @xcite that can detect such absorbers at @xmath29 ; this could be a sign that superwinds have a smaller filling factor in the igm than our simulations predict , or that more diffuse metals are less ionized ( see  [ sec : masslimit ] ) .",
    "lower carbon yields , possibly from a top - heavy imf , could potentially lower @xmath15 , while a different ionization background is more likely also to decrease @xmath15 compared to the _ bubble _ field . the determination of @xmath86 also can potentially alter @xmath15 by a factor of two .",

    "we present cumulative rest equivalent width ( ew ) distributions at @xmath130 and 6 for all five species in figure [ fig : ew ] .",
    "this is intended to facilitate future observational comparisons , as well as present a more realistic assessment of the discriminatory power of high-@xmath17 metal absorber statistics from lower resolution near - ir spectrographs .",
    "many of the trends already discussed earlier in this section are reproduced here .",
    "the average weaker ionizing flux of the _ hm2001 _ field at @xmath54 results in more strong @xmath1 absorbers and fewer strong @xmath2 absorbers compared to the _ bubble _ field ; the opposite is true for weak absorbers .",

    "@xmath3 best distinguishes neutral and ionized gas .",
    "we note that ews , particularly at the high end , may be influenced by the phenomenon of turbulent broadening . in @xcite",
    "we found turbulent broadening necessary to reproduce the observed low-@xmath17 @xmath72 @xmath322-parameter distribution .",
    "the purported turbulence occurs far below the mass scale resolved by our simulation , and could be associated with energy injection by outflows  @xcite . since high-@xmath17 absorbers are universally young and associated with recent outflows , turbulence may result in a higher ew ( for saturated lines ) , which would affect the high end ew distribution .",
    "@xcite observed velocity differences in @xmath323 @xmath2 profiles from lensed quasar los pairs at sub - kpc scales , which indicate more turbulence than we expect in most low-@xmath17 @xmath72 absorbers .",
    "fortunately , turbulence should not much affect the weak end , since turbulent broadening will leave ews mostly unaltered .",
    "the other observables we have considered such as @xmath15 all deal with column densities , which should remain unaffected by turbulent broadening as long as lines are not saturated .",
    "@xmath322-parameters are the observable most likely affected by turbulent broadening , and may explain some of the broad @xmath2 profiles seen by @xcite and @xcite , although @xcite suggests that these may be multi - component systems with smaller line widths if observed at higher resolution .",
    "we also consider the case of a metallicity floor of @xmath153 added everywhere in the simulation box with the uniform _",
    "ionization field at @xmath54 for @xmath2 ( long dashed cyan line in the upper panel of figure [ fig : ew ] ) .",
    "note that for a chabrier imf and @xcite yields , obtaining this metal floor would involve turning 0.05% of baryons into stars , equivalent to all the stars formed by @xmath324 , and distributing this uniformly among all baryons , which seems implausible .",
    "hence this scenario requires a more exotic origin , possibly resulting from very early fast winds powered by high - yield vmss .",
    "such a scenario is similar to that assumed in semi - analytical enrichment models of @xcite &  @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated a complete filling factor of metals from pre - galactic outflows in their most extreme cases , while @xcite found as much as 40% of the @xmath54 volume is enriched to @xmath325 primarily by sn - driven outflows from early galaxies .",
    "the observational signature of such a metal floor is dramatic at the weak end of the @xmath2 equivalent width distribution . today",
    "s instruments should be able to integrate down to ew=30 m  to statistically distinguish between our standard simulation and a metal floor : 16.9 @xmath227 versus 5.7 @xmath227 .",
    "we also show this scenario in the cdd plot in the bottom left of figure [ fig : cdd ] ( long dashed cyan line ) .",
    "the highest @xmath25 observations yet at @xmath24 @xcite find no weak components , indicating that a significant fraction of the igm is not enriched far above @xmath326 .",
    "data is currently inconclusive as to the extent of volume enrichment at these low levels , but sitting on the brightest quasar at @xmath23 for several nights on an 8 - 10 meter telescope should produce the necessary @xmath25 of @xmath327 to adequately test this scenario .",
    "@xmath2 is by far the best species for testing such a scenario , because it is the most effective tracer of metals around mean overdensity at @xmath54 ; @xmath5 is ionized to @xmath328 at the same overdensities and the metallicity floor does affect the weak absorber frequency .    finally , we note a contrast in the @xmath2 distributions at high-@xmath17 to the @xmath329 ew distribution for @xmath72 . the faint end turnover of the latter shows very little sensitivity to the volume filling factor of metals @xcite .",
    "part of the difference is that @xmath72 is not tracing the lowest overdensities where metals reside at low-@xmath17 ; the @xmath2 contours overlap the metals at the lowest overdensities as shown in figure [ fig : ioncomp ] .",
    "this is precisely the reason why @xmath2 holds so much potential for mapping the true extent of high-@xmath17 metals .",
    "another observationally - accessible statistic is aligned absorber fractions .",

    "the alignment percentages are above 95% in every case .",
    "this lends support to the idea that the low ionization species observed by bsrs , which appear aligned in every case for @xmath3 observed above @xmath331 , are tracing metals where there is no ionizing flux above the lyman limit .",
    "these systems occur far too frequently to be arising within the ism of intervening galaxies according to bsrs",
    ". this could be evidence that patchy reionization is still occurring at these redshifts , or alternatively that dense cloudlets entrained in winds are self - shielded from the ionizing background .",
    "the latter scenario would predict that there be high ionization species in the same systems , possibly offset , indicating multi - phase outflows as observed locally  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and seen in galactic - scale simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore @xmath2 and @xmath5 could be very useful additional constraints .",
    "the high alignment fractions are helped by the fact that these three species have similar ews for typical type ii sne yields .",
    "aligned absorbers fall along the linear relations in each subplot of figure [ fig : align_neutral ] , where the ratios in column densities equal the ratios in type ii sne @xcite yields .",

    "we note that the faster moving materials absorb more in the lower ionization species with the weaker _",

    "more typical examples of quasar absorption line systems are shown in figure [ fig : sysspec_b30 ] where two loss have impact parameters , @xmath322 , of 30 kpc to the same galaxy .",

    "a similar velocity spread is observed by @xcite in his @xmath2 @xmath348 system .",
    "although an alignment within 30 kpcs occurs once in @xmath349 ( if we count the ten most massive galaxies in the d16n256vzw box ) , we will argue in  [ sec : galabs ] that such systems are qualitatively similar to systems observed around lower mass galaxies at lower impact parameters .",

    "we also address the physical environment of the _ hm2001 _ field , which may be most appropriate at @xmath354 , in  [ sec : physenvuniform ]    we concentrate on @xmath2 absorbers at @xmath54 , examining first their physical state and then their evolutionary status , and bring them together by exploring the high-@xmath17 galaxy - absorber connection .",
    "we consider an absorber s connection to the stellar mass of its originating galaxy , which in our models is a good proxy for the more observationally - accessible sfr .",

    "@xmath2 has the smallest global ionization correction at @xmath7 , because the ionization fractions of this species are ideally aligned with the range of densities at which metals reside at this redshift ( @xmath355 ) .",
    "histograms in the bottom left panel show that stronger absorbers trace higher overdensities .",
    "temperatures indicate predominantly photo - ionized @xmath2 .",
    "outflows typically heat gas to @xmath356  k around galaxies , but the gas quickly cools to warm igm temperatures due to efficient cooling in this range .",
    "this appears to contradict our previous work in od06 , where we claimed a significant fraction of @xmath8 @xmath2 ( 43% ) is collisionally ionized , but the difference arises because in od06 we quoted a mass - weighted fraction ( from particles ) , while here we are computing a volume - weighted quantity ( from spectra ) . for @xmath357 , our present models agree well with od06 , comparing figure 9 in od06 with the upper left of figure [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ] .",
    "regions with @xmath358 are mostly forming stars at @xmath54 , and the frequency of metal systems where @xmath359 includes sph particles above the sf threshold is @xmath360 . of the 54 components with @xmath361 ,",
    "only 12 have any traces of sf .",
    "ironically , only one of these 12 lines has its line center density at @xmath358 ; even when loss probe galactic environments , the @xmath2 absorbing gas is primarily intergalactic and @xmath362 ! this may be an unphysical amount of @xmath2 , but this one absorber comprises 88% of the total @xmath15 along all loss .",
    "this example illustrates the reason for the discrepancy between the volume - derived @xmath15 of @xmath261 absorbers versus the mass - derived @xmath15 , as discussed in  [ sec : omega ] . ] .",
    "hence our models clearly predict that the vast majority of typical @xmath2 absorbers are primarily intergalactic at @xmath54 , and the rest mostly trace halo outskirts .",
    "the average carbon metallicities at @xmath363 and @xmath364 are @xmath365 and @xmath366 @xmath367 respectively .",
    "this is about @xmath368 the igm metallicities at the corresponding overdensities , using the simulation - averaged metallicity - density relation in figure  [ fig : rho_z ] .",
    "hence @xmath2 absorbers are tracing a clumpy , inhomogeneous distribution of metals with a very low volume filling factor , @xmath369 .",
    "this is generic in our models , and is even seen at the present day for @xmath72 absorbers",
    "the metallicity inhomogeneity is even more extreme at @xmath130 : @xmath370 for @xmath371 , while the simulation - averaged metallicity is @xmath372 ( a factor of @xmath373 ) .",
    "this shows that metal - line absorbers trace an increasingly clumpy distribution of metals at early times going back from @xmath374 , a trend that extends to low-@xmath17 igm metals as traced by @xmath72 @xcite .    in summary , @xmath2 absorbers seen at @xmath8",
    "are mostly expected to be true intergalactic absorbers , not gas within galaxies or galactic halos .",
    "galaxy outflows reach a larger comoving volume at early times ( od08 ) , but in actuality they are enriching a small fraction of the volume in a highly patchy fashion .",
    "we now consider how an absorber s age relates to its environment , as a way of characterizing in which regions igm metals originate .",
    "an age - density anti - correlation exists in @xmath54 @xmath2 , with a significant spread , as shown in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ] .",
    "this is the same trend we see in low-@xmath17 @xmath72 @xcite where stronger absorbers trace higher densities that have been enriched more recently . in the case of @xmath2 ,",
    "absorbers over @xmath375 are more likely to trace metals ejected on average 100 myr ago , while weaker absorbers trace metals 100 - 300 myr ago from earlier galaxies when they were at lower mass and metallicity .",
    "the age - density relation can be understood by considering the age - galaxy distance ( @xmath376 , shown in physical kpc ) relation in the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ] .",
    "older absorbers have had time to travel greater distances reaching lower overdensities .",
    "taking @xmath376 divided by age , we can plot the average velocity these winds need to travel to get as far as they do , which we call the effective wind speed , @xmath377 .",
    "the gray solid line shows @xmath378 and the dashed lines on the left and right sides are 30 and 300 @xmath163 respectively . comparing this to the average wind speed at launch @xmath379  ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_wind ] ) , we see that outflowing gas typically slows @xmath380% by the time it reaches the igm . as argued in od08",
    ", this slowing is primarily hydrodynamical as outflows run into a dense igm , though gravity plays a non - trivial role .",
    "the good age-@xmath376 correlation indicates that these absorbers trace metals leaving galaxies for the first time .",
    "this also is expected from the evolutionary picture of feedback from @xmath381 presented in od08 , where we found that metals more often than not recycle ( i.e. return to a galaxy at later time and are shot out in another wind / form into stars ) .",
    "metals recycle on a timescale of 1 - 3 gyr reaching a median farthest distance of @xmath145 proper kpc from their parent galaxies .",
    "@xmath2 is tracing metals on their first journey into the igm , because the ages and distances in figure [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ] are nearly all less than the recycling times and turn - around distances .",
    "these absorbers primarily reside in the igm and not in halos , because the halo radius ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath382  physical kpc for all @xmath54 galaxies in our simulation ; nearly all absorbers are at distances above this value in figure [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ] .",
    "hence @xmath2 absorbers are tracing igm metals on their first journey outward from galaxies at @xmath54 .        as another way of considering absorber origin , we plot the ratio of the effective velocity to the launch velocity ( @xmath383 ) versus the distance from a galaxy ( left panel ) and the launch velocity ( right panel ) in figure [ fig : c4_z6_vw_vratio ] .",
    "this ratio should not exceed one , given that wind particles are slowed as they travel outward .",
    "a few absorbers at greater than one are mostly due to the rare instances when the neighboring galaxy is not the originating galaxy for a wind .",
    "the clearest trend is that @xmath384 shows a general decline with @xmath376 . for absorbers with @xmath385 , the strength of most components observed by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the median ratio is nearly unity at 3 - 5 kpc , 0.8 at 10 kpc , and 0.5 by 50 kpc .",
    "note that our outflow prescription  ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) turns off hydrodynamic forces for a time that does not exceed that required to cover 4  physical kpc ( at @xmath54 ) at @xmath66 .",
    "this shows that , as soon as hydro forces are turned on , outflows begin slowing down as they travel further from their parent galaxy .",
    "several other physically interesting trends are also evident in the right panel of figure [ fig : c4_z6_vw_vratio ] .",
    "first , stronger absorbers arise from more massive galaxies with greater @xmath66 ; more massive galaxies enrich the igm with higher metallicity outflows due to the mass - metallicity relationship at high redshift ( @xmath386 ; dfo06 ) .",
    "second , winds from massive galaxies slow down quicker as indicated by lower @xmath383 at higher @xmath66 ; this arises because massive galaxies tend to be surrounded by denser gas ( od08 ) .      while we have explored numerous relations between absorber physical and environmental parameters at @xmath54",
    ", there is as of yet no over - riding correlation to explain @xmath2 absorber strengths , as each parameter exhibits considerable scatter versus @xmath387 .",
    "here we argue that the _ fundamental relation _ governing metal absorbers is the stellar mass , @xmath100 , of the neighboring galaxy versus the distance to that galaxy , @xmath376 , and most other correlations are merely a consequence .",
    "the neighboring galaxy is defined as the galaxy with the greatest impinging flux on an absorber ( i.e. the nearest galaxy weighted by the inverse square law ) .",
    "figure [ fig : c4_z6_mgal_dgal ] shows the @xmath388 relation . as is evident , the relation between @xmath376 and @xmath387 at a given @xmath100 shows a strong correlation .     vs. @xmath389 elucidates the fundamental and close connection between galaxies and absorbers at high-@xmath17 .",
    "it reveals a strong correlation between @xmath387 and @xmath188 for a given mass galaxy .",
    "the ionizing conditions are identical in the _ bubble _ field along the gray dotted lines , explaining much of this correlation .",
    "evolutionary tracks ( solid gray lines for winds emanating from a @xmath390 , @xmath391 , &  @xmath392 galaxy ) tracing an absorber back to its parent galaxy assuming a constant @xmath378 and secular galaxy growth . currently observable @xmath54 @xmath2 absorbers are launched from galaxies between @xmath393 , but are observed around galaxies with @xmath110 .",
    "the color key for absorber strength in figure  [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ]  applies here . ]",
    "we plot gray dotted lines corresponding to the relation @xmath394 representing the constant flux levels resulting from the _ bubble _ field due to the inverse square law .",
    "if all physical conditions are equal , absorbers along these lines should be identical .",
    "indeed , this seems to hold reasonably well .",
    "hence the key deterministic relation for absorber strength is distance from galaxy of a given stellar mass , more so than any of the physical parameters explored in the previous sections .",
    "the paucity of absorbers below the bottom - most gray dotted line is only a selection effect poorly sampling these regions in a volume - averaged measurement ; very strong absorbers exist here if loss are fortunate enough to sample them ( e.g. the extreme systems displayed in figure [ fig : sysspec_b0 ] ) .",
    "absorbers are closely related to galaxies at high-@xmath17 moreso than any other time because ( i ) metals are on their first journey into the igm , ( ii ) they are still in close proximity to their parent galaxies , and ( iii ) galaxy evolution is relatively simple to understand at high-@xmath17 as galaxies are mostly evolving in isolation .",
    "we use these assumptions to construct the solid gray `` evolutionary tracks '' that metals take into the igm , assuming constant @xmath395 and an exponentially increasing @xmath100 with time , which approximately falls out of the integration of equation [ eqn : sfr_m * ] .",
    "although both of these assumptions are not exactly true , this treatment reveals some important behaviors .",
    "first , `` isochrones '' travel parallel to the x - axis of figure [ fig : c4_z6_mgal_dgal ] by construction if @xmath377 is assumed to be independent of @xmath389 , meaning the absorbers of the same age are found at a similar distance .",
    "this of course an oversimplification , because @xmath377 slows down as time passes and winds with higher @xmath66 slows down faster .",
    "however , this explains why there are very few weak absorbers ( @xmath396 ) around @xmath128 galaxies ; metals simply have not had time to travel far enough to the low - density regions where weak @xmath2 absorbers would arise .",
    "second , tracing the evolutionary tracks back to the bottom reveals the mass of the launch galaxy for each metal absorber .",
    "dfo06 plotted the mass - metallicity relationship of @xmath54 and @xmath130 galaxies , finding that gas metallicity increases by @xmath397 dex per decade of @xmath100 .",
    "although the over - riding trend for absorber strength depends on the ionizing flux in the _ bubble _ field , a more subtle trend ( hardly visible ) is that absorbers grow stronger rightward along the same dotted gray line primarily as a result of the mass - metallicity relationship .",
    "however , this effect is about half as strong as expected ( @xmath398 dex ) , and should be counter - balanced by increased mass loading factors of smaller galaxies . also , consider that @xmath377 is not really constant , which limits us from over - interpreting this plot .",
    "the only candidate observed high-@xmath17 galaxy-@xmath2 absorber connection is along the j1030 + 0524 los , where @xcite notes the observed systems at @xmath399 may be related to an excess of @xmath36-band dropouts observed by @xcite along this quasar los .",
    "in our models , most absorbers between @xmath261 are associated with galaxies where @xmath110 , which have corresponding 1350   ab magnitudes ranging between @xmath400 and @xmath401 ( see the luminosity range bounded by green dotted lines in figure [ fig : lumfunc ] ) , and sfrs from @xmath402 . the closest of the j1030 absorbers lies about 50 arcseconds away from a galaxy , i.e. an impact parameter of 300 kpc , which is too far for our winds to reach ( e.g. @xmath403 for 300 myr ) ; plus the magnitudes of these galaxies appear to be brighter than any of the galaxies in the d16n256vzw simulation box .",
    "this may be an extended overdense region of space where smaller , currently unobservable galaxies are primarily responsible for the enrichment .",
    "the uniform _",
    "_ background case may be more appropriate below @xmath54 , and actually better explains the observed frequency of strong @xmath2 absorbers at @xmath250 , although it is more discrepant in over - estimating weaker absorbers .",
    "we show the galaxy - absorber connection plot in figure [ fig : c4_z6_mgal_dgal_uniform ] for this field and note the following differences .",
    "first , the distance and mass of the neighboring galaxy matters less for the characteristics of these absorbers ; the dotted lines do not have any meaning , but are shown for relative contrasts with figure [ fig : c4_z6_mgal_dgal ] . as this field is weaker near galaxies , there are fewer strong absorbers because carbon is in lower ionization states .",
    "for the same reason , there are more weak @xmath2 absorbers at greater distances from galaxies , because these metals are otherwise ionized to @xmath404 by the _ bubble _ field .     for te _ bubble",
    "_ model . here",
    "the gray dotted lines do not have any significance , but are shown for reference .",
    "fewer strong absorbers exist near galaxies and more weak absorbers exist far from galaxies due to the weaker ionizing field in such environments . one important difference with the _ bubble _ field is that strong absorbers are only associated with @xmath405 galaxies , and these absorbers trace enriched low - density regions further from galaxies .",
    "the color key for absorber strength in figure  [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ]  applies here . ]",
    "a potentially accessible distinguishing characteristic of the two fields involves components with @xmath406 , which are only found around @xmath405 galaxies in the uniform case .",
    "these absorbers arise in the situations like those illustrated in figure [ fig : snaps_z60_gal2 ] , where a bipolar outflow copiously enriches the low density igm outside of filaments where the _",
    "@xmath2 ionization correction is lowest .",
    "the strongest absorbers actually arise from overdensities less than 10 , which is the opposite of the behavior in the _ bubble _ model .",
    "both our backgrounds produce a significant amount of weak absorbers ( @xmath407 ) , contributing non - trivially to @xmath15 ( 30% in the _ bubble _ case and 70% in the _",
    "hm2001 _ case ) .",
    "the two observational @xmath54 @xmath2 cdd constraints shown in figure [ fig : cdd ] ( bottom right ) suggest a possibly shallower distribution than either of our models produce , with the @xmath2 mass density coming almost exclusively from strong systems .",
    "the @xcite data point is a conservative upper limit , and already provides a powerful constraint that we interpret as indicating a significant volume of the igm is not enriched far above @xmath408 .",
    "however , if we consider that they observe no @xmath2 absorbers between @xmath371 and assume their completeness is 75% over this column density range ( this seems reasonably conservative using their figure 3 ) , the difference with our models is even more stark .",
    "we predict 3.3 and 3.9 such absorbers should be detected at @xmath409 for the _ bubble _ and _ hm2001 _ fields respectively over the @xcite adjusted pathlength of @xmath410 .",
    "a possible explanation is that the small galaxies in our simulation do not produce @xmath2 absorbers for some reason .",
    "the evolutionary tracks in figure [ fig : c4_z6_mgal_dgal ] can be used as a stellar mass cut for which galaxies produce @xmath2 systems .",
    "for example , if the originating @xmath100 must be @xmath411 , then only absorbers right of the middle evolutionary track contribute . systems below @xmath412 are more than halved , while leaving the stronger end unaffected if applying this cut .",
    "the power law slope now approaches @xmath413 ( i.e. equal numbers of absorbers in low and high density cdd bins ) .",
    "why would low - mass haloes not produce @xmath2 absorbers ?",
    "a possible explanation is that the highly mass - loaded outflows from small galaxies self - shield metals leading to them being observed in lower ionization states .",
    "thus the over - excess of @xmath2 absorbers and @xmath15 in either ionization background may be counter - balanced by the bsrs low - ionization systems , which are underestimated when applying these backgrounds to all metals .",
    "a second possibility for us overestimating weak @xmath2 absorbers is that our outflows are traveling too far into the igm .",
    "for example , there exist few very weak , @xmath414 , absorbers around galaxies @xmath415 in figure [ fig : c4_z6_mgal_dgal ] because winds have not had time to enrich regions at @xmath416 kpc .",
    "if wind speeds are even lower , metals will populate less of the @xmath417 phase space at large @xmath188 , where they otherwise would produce weaker @xmath2 absorbers .",
    "our discussion in this section on the galaxy - absorber connection may be currently inaccessible to observations and somewhat speculative , as only a handful of absorbers at @xmath8 are known thus far and identifying the nearest galaxy may have to await a next - generation facility .",
    "our purpose is to emphasize the @xmath388 relation as the key one for understanding the origin and subsequent evolution of high-@xmath17 metal - line absorbers .",
    "as these early galaxies push a majority of their metals into the igm , the metals are still close enough that the high-@xmath17 galaxy - absorber connection tightly establishes the absorber properties .",
    "this is a fundamental prediction of our model , and if proved correct , offers a novel way to probe feedback processes in the reionization epoch .",
    "we now examine the physical conditions of @xmath1 absorbers , as a representative of lower ionization species . in  [ sec : ionbehave ]  we showed @xmath1 traces higher overdensities closer to galaxies ; therefore we might expect this species to trace metal - enriched outflows at an earlier stage .",
    "this turns out to be only partially true . in figure",
    "[ fig : c2_z6 ]  we plot @xmath1 absorbers in @xmath174 phase space demonstrating that @xmath1 absorbers do not trace the same extent of this phase space as @xmath2 .",
    "our visualization in figure [ fig : snaps60 ] shows @xmath1 tracing less volume than @xmath2 .",
    "another difference is there is a stronger correlation with density for @xmath1 , much more so than for @xmath2 .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath1 ionization fraction falls off rapidly toward lower overdensities as shown in figure [ fig : ioncomp ]  while the @xmath2 ionization fraction peaks at overdensities corresponding to intergalactic metals .",
    "@xmath1 absorption strength depends much more on the physical state ( density ) than @xmath2 , which depends more on its environmental state ( proximity to and mass & metallicity of its parent galaxy ) .",
    "the ionization field has little effect here , because density is the primary determinant for @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 tracing higher overdensities translates into this species tracing regions closer to the launch galaxy , as the range in @xmath188 in figure  [ fig : c2_z6 ]  is less than that for @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath282 arises from absorbers at the same ages traced by the @xmath2 absorbers ( compare y - axis histograms in the center panel of figure [ fig : c2_z6 ]  and bottom left panel of [ fig : c4_z6_4panel ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 is tracing older metals that remain closer to their parent galaxies by virtue of either lower @xmath66 or more hydrodynamic slowing .",
    "the primary reason is the lower @xmath66 : the average @xmath66 of a @xmath1 absorber is 150 @xmath163 versus 250 @xmath163 , while the @xmath383 ratio is not different than that for @xmath2 ; hence @xmath1 is arising from slower winds around less massive galaxies . despite @xmath1 tracing a different set of winds , 62% of @xmath1 absorbers over 50 m  are aligned with @xmath2 in the _ bubble _ field .",
    "rare strong @xmath1 absorbers trace some of the youngest outflows ( @xmath418 myrs ) , which are sometimes still within the galactic halos of @xmath54 galaxies .    in the right panel of figure [",
    "fig : c2_z6 ] , @xmath1 strength is determined more plainly by @xmath188 independent of @xmath100 , which is a result of this ion s greater dependence on density compared to @xmath2 .",
    "the galaxy - absorber connection is _ not _ as important for @xmath1 absorber strength .",
    "if @xmath419 is mostly independent of @xmath100 , the selection effects of loss probing a random volume finds the average @xmath1 absorber around a smaller galaxy .",
    "the median @xmath389 of the @xmath420 histogram in the bottom of this panel is @xmath421 , corresponding to a sfr of 0.03 @xmath422 .",
    "@xmath1 is probing a different set of metals than @xmath2 , which itself is tracing faster winds arising from more massive galaxies ( @xmath423 ) enriching a larger volume .",
    "we are already delving into the hypothetical here by considering the physical and environmental parameters of absorbers and galaxies not even discovered yet , so we take it one step further by considering what @xmath2 absorbers trace at @xmath130 .",
    "if our suggestion that @xmath2 absorbers are tracing metals on their first journey into the igm , metals should be observed even closer to galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "this indeed is the case in figure  [ fig : c4_z8 ] for @xmath130 absorbers ; the absorbers occupy slightly higher overdensity ( left panel ) than at @xmath54 due to winds not reaching mean overdensities yet , while absorbers are closer to their parent galaxies as a consequence of having less time to travel ( middle panel ) .",
    "these absorbers have @xmath377 more similar to @xmath66 signifying these outflows are just leaving their galaxy .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath383 for the absorbers between with @xmath385 for @xmath424 kpc is 0.73 at @xmath130 versus 0.62 at @xmath54 .",
    "such absorbers at @xmath130 trace outflowing gas more directly , whereas at @xmath54 some absorbers at this distance trace outflows that have already stalled or are returning to galaxies .",
    "the right panel displays our galaxy - absorber connection plot with dotted lines corresponding to constant _ bubble _ ionization flux , while gray lines are evolutionary tracks assuming @xmath425 and the sfr is doubled from equation  [ eqn : sfr_m * ]  as in dfo6 at @xmath130 versus @xmath54 .",
    "the more rapid assembly of galaxies at this epoch is noticeable by greater curvature in these evolutionary tracks ; more galactic evolution likely has occurred in an absorber s associated galaxy despite the younger age of the universe .",
    "the mass - metallicity holds at this redshift ( dfo06 ) and appears to play a role in the increasing @xmath387 for more massive galaxies .",
    "we explore high redshift metal - line absorbers using a state - of - the - art , @xmath426 particle gadget-2  cosmological simulation enriching the igm with star formation - driven galactic outflows .",
    "our galactic outflows follow the predicted relations of momentum - driven winds , where outflow velocity scales with galaxy velocity dispersion and the mass loading factor scales inversely , leading to higher mass loading from small galaxies . our purpose is to reproduce igm metal - line observations at @xmath7 while providing predictions for future observations out to @xmath130 , as well as to investigate the physical nature of high-@xmath17 metal absorbers and its connection to galaxies .",
    "we explore five species ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , &  @xmath5 ) using three different ionizing backgrounds : fully neutral , fully reionized , and a patchy bubble model based on the flux of the nearest galaxy .",
    "our key results and predictions are as follows : + ( i ) metal lines already discovered at @xmath48 are primarily tracing the diffuse igm , not gas in galaxies .",
    "some @xmath2 lines already discovered could be tracing metals at overdensities not much higher than the mean density of the universe .",
    "\\(ii ) we can reproduce the observed trends of @xmath15 at @xmath427 with steady enrichment of the igm filling only 1% of the igm with metals by @xmath14 .",
    "the recent samples of @xcite and @xcite that find lower @xmath15s suggests that the filling factor could be even less .",
    "we also propose that patchy ionization conditions where some metals are ionized by their local galaxy and others are not ionized may best explain the observed trends in both @xmath2 and lower ionization absorbers .",
    "the determination of @xmath15 is also highly dependent on the shape of the ionizing field ( especially above 47.9 ev ) , sne yields , the @xmath86 parameter , and the number of @xmath321 absorbers .",
    "\\(iii ) the global gas - phase metallicity increases by a factor of @xmath428 from @xmath6 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath15 generally reflects this change , but the exact amount of evolution depends on the form of the ionization background .",
    "the uniform @xcite evolving background results in an increase in @xmath15 of @xmath429 , while the _ bubble _ field shows only a @xmath291 increase reflecting the actual increase in gas - phase metals .",
    "the greater ionization intensity around 47.9 ev in the latter background , which is a result of the dust attenuation law we apply along with the proximity of metals to galaxies , results in @xmath195 greater @xmath15 at @xmath130 .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath2 is the ideal tracer for metals at low overdensities at @xmath54 , and its detection holds the best option at high-@xmath17 to determine the volume filling factor of metals .",
    "@xmath2 has the lowest global ionization correction at @xmath7 ( i.e. @xmath430c@xmath431 is at its maximum ) . adding a metallicity floor of @xmath153 will have dramatic effects on the numbers of weak @xmath2 absorbers , just below thresholds of currently published results . integrating for several nights on a single bright @xmath23 quasar could determine if a significant portion of the igm volume is enriched to this level .",
    "the results of @xcite already indicate that a significant volume of the igm is unlikely to be enriched much above @xmath153 , and possibly there exists too many weak @xmath2 absorbers in our model without this floor .",
    "\\(v ) the velocity profiles of systems are dominated by the peculiar velocities of outflowing gas .",
    "we reproduce the large @xmath335 s ( @xmath432 ) observed in strong @xmath3 and @xmath2 systems .",
    "the hubble expansion of spatially distributed metals alone is far too small to create these observed system profiles .",
    "\\(vi ) the galaxies responsible for the enrichment of the igm have stellar masses in the range of @xmath433 and corresponding rest - frame uv magnitudes of @xmath400 and @xmath401 ( 1350   ab ) when considering @xmath2 , and a factor of ten less when considering @xmath1 .",
    "most absorbers should still be near their originating galaxies ( 5 - 50 physical kpc for @xmath54 @xmath2 and 2 - 20 kpc for @xmath1 absorbers ) .",
    "we stress the need to identify such galaxies , which will require the likes of jwst and 30-meter telescope facilities , in order to study the high-@xmath17 galaxy - absorber connection .",
    "identifying the environments of strong @xmath2 components ( @xmath434 ) can constrain the ionizing source : within @xmath435 kpc of @xmath436 galaxies for the _ bubble _ field , and at @xmath437 kpc around @xmath438 galaxies for the _ hm2001 _ field .",
    "\\(vii ) the abundance of @xmath3 absorbers observed by @xcite in the sdss j1148 + 5251 sight line is consistent with metals residing in a neutral igm ( as also argued by those authors ) .",
    "we can not produce such a frequency of @xmath3 within our models with ionization extending above the lyman limit .",
    "the excellent alignment with @xmath1 and @xmath4 in this dataset also strongly supports this .",
    "the fact that most sight lines show much less @xmath3 suggests the possibility that reionization is still inhomogeneous over large scales at @xmath38 .",
    "it is unlikely to be an effect of inhomogeneous enrichment , since smaller galaxies with relatively low clustering lengths are primarily responsible for enriching the igm at these epochs .",
    "another possibility for broad @xmath3 systems observed down to @xmath439 are metals entrained in outflows , which remain shielded from the ionization background as they travel into the igm .",
    "\\(viii ) aligned absorber ratios are a powerful tool to determine the physical parameters of the metal - enriched igm and the nature of the ionization field .",
    "aligned absorbers with both components above 50 m  are rare at @xmath54 , unless the igm is neutral .",
    "this makes the @xcite finding of frequent low - ionization aligned absorbers all the more supportive of either a neutral ( probably recombined ) portion of the igm , or metals entrained in self - shielded outflows as the travel into the igm .",
    "+ our analysis in od08 indicated that most metals injected into the igm recycle back into galaxies on a typical timescale of @xmath440 gyrs . hence at @xmath48 , metals should primarily be on the outward leg of their first journey into the igm .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case when we look in detail at the evolutionary state of absorbers .",
    "this has consequences for the galaxy - absorber connection , in that this relationship is closest at high-@xmath17 because metals are still in relatively close proximity of their parent galaxies .",
    "absorbers trace gas on an outward trajectory still holding signatures of their galactic outflow origin , while possibly being primarily irradiated by their parent galaxy s radiation field .",
    "the properties of @xmath2 absorbers depend most on their evolutionary relation to their parent galaxy ( proximity , mass , & metallicity ) , while lower ionization species depend more on the physical state of the gas ( density , primarily ) .",
    "this is a result of the different @xmath174 phase space traced by these ions .",
    "another tenet of od08 is that metals travel a relatively constant physical distance ( @xmath441 kpc ) from their parent galaxies , meaning early outflows have the greatest chance of enriching a large volume of the universe .",
    "however this journey takes significant time as wind outflows travel at an average of @xmath442 taking @xmath443 gyr to get to this distance , or more than the age of any stars at @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the volume of the universe enriched to significant levels ( i.e. 0.01 - 0.1 @xmath367 ) grows by an order of magnitude over the relatively brief time ( 575 myr ) covered between @xmath6 .",
    "this era can be called the `` age of volume enrichment .",
    "'' however metals do not exhibit the expansionist zeal of the mongol empire when it comes to enriching the igm ; the vast majority of the igm ( as much as 90% ) still remains unenriched in our simulations run to @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "the outlook for the study of very high-@xmath17 metal lines in the igm looks promising as long as sources ( quasars and grbs ) are discovered to provide light bulbs for the near - ir spectrometers that will be on - line in the near future .",
    "relatively low resolution and @xmath25 observations can provide key constraints as to the filling factors of metals , the velocities and mass loading factors of the winds that put the metals there , and of course the ionization state of the igm .",
    "in contrast to metal lines between @xmath16 , we expect significant evolution in metal - line properties between @xmath6 , a prediction that may have already been observed by @xcite and @xcite . further down",
    "the line is the study of the intriguing high-@xmath17 galaxy - absorber connection , as this relation is closer than at lower redshift .",
    "the jwst and 20 - 30 meter class telescopes are required to study this realm as galaxies at @xmath444 with sfrs below 0.5 @xmath422 , which are primarily responsible for most igm metal lines at @xmath445 . to sum it all up ,",
    "absorption line spectroscopy applied to the early universe should yield significant insights into early galaxy formation , and whether such galaxies enrich the igm in a manner similar to lower redshift systems , or in some exotic fashions not considered here .",
    "we suspect the former .",

    "<S> intergalactic medium ( igm ) metal absorption lines observed in @xmath0 spectra offer the opportunity to probe early feedback processes , the nature of enriching sources , and the topology of reionization . </S>",
    "<S> we run high - resolution cosmological simulations including galactic outflows to study the observability and physical properties of 5 ions ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) in absorption between @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we apply three cases for ionization conditions : fully neutral , fully reionized , and a patchy model based on the flux from the nearest galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our simulations can broadly fit available @xmath7 igm metal - line data , although all observations can not be accommodated with a single ionization condition . </S>",
    "<S> variations in @xmath3 absorbers among sight lines seen by becker et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2006 ) suggest significant neutral igm patches down to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> strong @xmath2 absorbers at @xmath9 may be the result of ionization by the galaxy responsible for that enrichment , although the identification of the neighboring galaxy will have to wait to confirm this . </S>",
    "<S> our outflows have typical speeds of @xmath10  km / s and mass loading factors of @xmath11 . such high mass loading is critical for enriching the igm to the observed levels while sufficiently curtailing early star formation to match the observed rest - frame uv luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the volume filling factor of metals increases during this epoch , but only reaches @xmath12 for @xmath13 by @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> detectable absorbers generally trace inhomogeneously - distributed metals residing outside of galactic halos . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is an ideal tracer of igm metals at @xmath7 , with dropping global ionization fractions to either higher or lower redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a strongly increasing global @xmath2 mass density ( @xmath15 ) from @xmath6 , in contrast to its relative constancy from @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations do not support widespread early igm enrichment from e.g. population iii stars , as this would overpredict the numbers of weak @xmath2 absorbers in the latest data . </S>",
    "<S> high-@xmath17 absorbers arise from metals mostly on their first outward journey , at distances 5 - 50 physical kpc , and often exhibit broad profiles ( @xmath18 ) as a result of outflowing peculiar velocities in the strongest systems . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies responsible for early igm enrichment have typical stellar masses of @xmath19 , and star formation rates @xmath20yr . </S>",
    "<S> future facilities will be able to study the high-@xmath17 galaxy - absorber connection in detail , revealing a wealth of information about feedback processes in the reionization epoch .    </S>",
