    "with the recent success of model building in the framework of the heterotic @xmath0 string theory @xcite it becomes important to reconsider the questions of moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "early attempts considered fluxes and gaugino condensates @xcite , race track superpotentials @xcite and/or khler stabilization @xcite .    more recently , these questions have been studied in the framework of type iib string theory .",
    "while explicit model building towards the mssm ( the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ) is more difficult in this framework , it is usually argued that the stabilization of moduli can be achieved quite easily .",
    "the reason is the appearance of two types of fluxes [ neveu - schwarz  neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) and ramond  ramond ( r - r ) ] @xcite while only one of them is present in the heterotic theory . with the inclusion of nonperturbative effects like gaugino condensation one",
    "might then stabilize all moduli @xcite .",
    "still , there is a problem with the adjustment of the vacuum energy @xmath1 to a small positive value .",
    "one has to postulate a so - called `` up - lifting '' sector that adjusts @xmath1 to the desired value @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this up - lifting sector has important consequences for the explicit pattern of supersymmetry breakdown @xcite . instead of modulus mediation one",
    "is led to a hybrid mediation scheme and a so - called `` mirage pattern '' of the soft breaking terms emerges @xcite .    within the framework of the heterotic string",
    ", the importance of this up - lifting sector has not been fully appreciated so far .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to fill this gap . to illustrate the importance of this sector",
    ", we consider a simple example : a gaugino condensate in the absence of a flux background .",
    "this is known to lead to a so - called run - away potential with a supersymmetric vacuum at @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 denotes the dilaton field ) .",
    "attempts to stabilize the dilaton at a finite value include the consideration of nonperturbative correction to the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the resulting scheme is believed to provide a mediation of supersymmetry breakdown that is dominated by the dilaton .",
    "still the question of the fine - tuning of the vacuum energy has to be addressed . in the existing examples it seems again that an additional sector is needed to adjust the vacuum energy to the desired value @xcite , just like the up - lifting sector in the type iib case . to be explicit ,",
    "we consider the model of barreiro , carlos and copeland ( bcc ) ref .",
    "@xcite that appears to be particularly suited for a class of realistic heterotic models @xcite",
    ". a stabilization of the dilaton can be achieved , but the actual value of @xmath1 turns out to be large and positive so that the desired `` up - lifting '' mechanism should provide a `` down - lift '' of @xmath1 .",
    "we here consider the mechanism of lebedev , nilles and ratz ( lnr ) @xcite to adjust @xmath1 . in the framework of type iib theory",
    "this is known as @xmath4-term uplifting @xcite and could be originated in dynamical schemes as considered in @xcite or schemes that might require the existence of additional branes and/or anti - branes @xcite .",
    "an explicit discussion of supersymmetry breakdown leads to similar conclusions as in the type iib case , the uplifting sector is important for the mechanism of supersymmetry ( susy ) breakdown and its mediation such that a variant of a mirage pattern emerges @xcite .",
    "there are , however , some quantitative differences between the heterotic and the type iib case that will be discussed in detail .",
    "so far it seems that the stabilization of the dilaton requires sizeable nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential while the uplifting sector adjusts @xmath1 .",
    "a closer inspection , however , reveals the surprising fact that one can switch off the corrections to the khler potential and still remain with a stabilized dilaton ! _ the uplifting sector alone is responsible for both , modulus stabilization and adjustment of the vacuum energy . _ stabilization of the dilaton neither requires nonvanishing flux nor corrections to the khler potential .",
    "the appearance of a gaugino condensate , however , remains crucial .",
    "this remarkable fact shows that modulus stabilization in heterotic string theory is not as difficult as usually assumed .",
    "one just needs a suitable uplifting sector very similar to the one postulated in the framework of type iib string theory .",
    "it also shows the importance of this uplifting sector for moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "moreover it leads to a hybrid mediation scheme and its signature is a mirage pattern of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we shall discuss the model of ref @xcite with a gaugino condensate and nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential .",
    "we present the heterotic analogy of uplifting in the spirit of lnr @xcite , the adjustment of the vacuum energy of the metastable vacuum and the discussion of supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "this will be followed by a discussion of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters , the appearance of a mirage pattern and the phenomenological properties of the set - up .",
    "section 4 will contain some concluding remarks .",
    "dilaton stabilization in the context of heterotic string theory can occur via a racetrack mechanism @xcite or by the means of nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the former option , consisting of at least two gaugino condensates , leads to a scenario where both the auxiliary field of the dilaton and the @xmath5 modulus are nonzero with typically @xmath6 .",
    "the latter option might require just one gaugino condensate , but sizeable nonperturbative corrections to the tree level khler potential . under certain circumstances",
    "this leads to a scenario with @xmath7 which is also known as the _ dilaton domination scenario_.    casas @xcite has investigated the impact of an arbitrary khler potential on the low energy theory and also introduced possible string motivated nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential .",
    "the distinct feature of this ansatz was the fact that it became possible to stabilize the dilaton at phenomenologically acceptable values @xmath8 , although the minimum of the scalar potential turned out to be de sitter .    in this work",
    "we shall investigate the impact of the presence of an up - lifting sector ( consisting of hidden sector matter fields @xcite ) on a set - up with just one gaugino condensate and the tree - level khler potential .",
    "but let us first repeat the arguments of @xcite and present the explicit model of bcc @xcite .",
    "consider @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dedekind eta function ( convention as in @xcite ) , insuring the correct transformation under the @xmath11 target space modular invariance and @xmath12 if the condensing gauge group is @xmath13 .",
    "the khler potential at tree - level is given by @xmath14 in the supergravity language the scalar potential and the @xmath4 terms are expressed in terms of the function @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the khler potential and the superpotential , respectively .",
    "the scalar potential is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 denote differentiation with respect to the fields and @xmath21 is the inverse khler metric .",
    "the @xmath4 terms are found to be @xmath22 using eqs.([eqn : super],[eqn : kahler ] ) we obtain @xmath23 with @xmath24 . in this work",
    "we will assume that the khler modulus is stabilized at one of the self - dual points of the @xmath25 function , leading to @xmath7 .",
    "from now on we will drop the @xmath5 dependence in khler potential , gauge kinetic function and superpotential and rescale @xmath26 .    in order to provide the formation of a minimum and so to stabilize the dilaton we look at the stationary point condition @xmath27 which relates the derivatives of @xmath28 as @xmath29 if we only use the tree - level khler potential @xmath30 , eq.([eqn : oldgrelation ] ) becomes @xmath31_{{\\re\\mathfrak{e}\\hspace{1pt}}{s}\\simeq 2 } & = 0 , \\label{eqn : oldwrong}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can not be solved for any reasonable value of @xmath32 or @xmath33 , respectively .    ) . ]    ) . ]",
    "therefore one obtains a runaway potential for the dilaton ( fig.[fig : runaway ] ) . adding nonperturbative corrections to standard tree - level khler potential as motivated in @xcite @xmath34 \\label{eqn : npkahler}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provides an extra contribution to eq.([eqn : oldwrong ] ) which also must be sizeable in order to allow for a solution .",
    "the explicit model of @xcite typically obtains a potential as displayed in fig.[fig : copeland ] .",
    "stabilization of the dilaton depends crucially on the presence of nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential .",
    "otherwise we would have a run - away behaviour of the dilaton and no stabilization .",
    "typically the vacuum energy turns out to be too large and a `` down - lift '' to a smaller value is necessary . an additional contribution to the scalar potential",
    "is therefore needed to give a solution to eq.([eqn : oldgrelation ] ) .",
    "the role of such an additional contribution should allow the adjustment of the vacuum energy to a zero ( or small ) value .",
    "_ we shall see that such an additional sector will stabilize the dilaton even in the absence of the nonperturbative corrections to the khler potential .",
    "_      we would like to investigate the interaction of the set - up described in the previous section with a new hidden sector designed to adjust the vacuum energy .",
    "this is the heterotic analogy of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding khler potential reads @xmath35 with @xmath36 being a hidden sector matter field , assumed to be a singlet under unbroken gauge symmetries . from eq.([eqn : scalarpot ] ) we obtain @xmath37 as obvious from eq.([eqn : newpot ] ) there are now new contributions to the scalar potential which , by properly adjusting the parameters of the new sector , may modify the shape of the scalar potential .",
    "let us for concreteness and simplicity consider the polonyi superpotential @xcite and focus on the possibility of having a minkowski vacuum .",
    "the superpotential for this choice is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are constants .",
    "the scalar potential eq.([eqn : newpot ] ) becomes @xmath41 where we have introduced the quantities @xmath42 which denote the contribution of the dilaton and hidden sector matter field to susy breaking , respectively .",
    "the stationary point conditions now become @xmath43\\stackrel{!}{=}0 , \\label{eqn : stationarys}\\\\ \\frac{{\\partial}v}{{\\partial}c } & = v\\,{\\overline{c } } + e^k \\big [ -w_c\\,\\gamma^s + { \\overline{w}}\\,{\\overline{\\gamma}}^c + w_c\\,{\\overline{c}}\\,\\gamma^c -3w_c{\\overline{w } } \\big]\\stackrel{!}{=}0 .",
    "\\label{eqn : stationaryc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we show that eqs.([eqn : stationarys],[eqn : stationaryc ] ) are satisfied at @xmath44 to prove whether the stationary point corresponds to a minimum we have to calculate the hessian matrix for the scalar potential and subsequently evaluate the eigenvalues . in this analysis",
    "we can neglect the vacuum energy @xmath45 .",
    "up to the factor @xmath46}\\sim\\mathcal{o}(1)$ ] the second derivatives of @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 one can now consider two cases .",
    "for @xmath49 the susy breaking is dominated by the dilaton .",
    "however this does not correspond to a satisfactory choice as the contribution from the polonyi sector would then not be sufficient to solve eqs.([eqn : stationarys],[eqn : stationaryc ] ) .",
    "therefore it is more interesting to look at the so - called _ matter dominated _ susy breaking where @xmath50 .",
    "the leading order term in eqs.([eqn : vss][eqn : vscbar ] ) is @xmath51 .",
    "next to leading order terms are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "all other contributions are sub - leading and can be neglected in this analysis . in the matrix element @xmath54",
    "contributes at the next to leading order .",
    "we however neglect it here to keep the hessian as simple as possible in order to obtain transparent equations for the eigenvalues . ]",
    "thus we arrive at @xmath55 with @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the indices of the hessian are defined as @xmath58 .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath59 and are all positive .",
    "this proves that the stationary point is a local minimum .",
    "moreover the spectrum consists of two heavy states with masses of order @xmath60 and two light states with masses of order @xmath61 .      in consideration of a vanishing / small cosmological constant eq.([eqn : newpot ] )",
    "can be parameterized as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a fine - tuning parameter and @xmath64 .",
    "then the vacuum energy is @xmath65 the solution to first order in @xmath63 reads @xmath66 by choosing @xmath40 , which sets the scale of the polonyi field , one obtains @xmath67 , implying that the system under consideration can be used to construct a minkowski minimum ( or adjusting the vacuum energy to a small value ) . an example is presented in figs.[fig : sdirection ] and [ fig:3dplot ] .",
    "let us now have a look at the gravitino mass .",
    "it is given by @xmath68 and the polonyi part in the superpotential dominates .",
    "so we see that @xmath40 controls not only the mass of the polonyi field but also the gravitino mass .",
    "furthermore , for the dilaton we obtain @xmath69 the quantity @xmath70 can be estimated as follows .",
    "the stationary point conditions for the scalar potential eq.([eqn : newpot ] ) read @xmath71 the first term in each equation vanishes at the minimum and the remaining terms give relations among the derivatives of @xmath28 .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "we then arrive at @xmath74 the choice of a minkowski vacuum ( or small vacuum energy ) requires @xmath75 to have a value that cancels the contribution of @xmath76 in eq.([eqn : combinedfs ] ) and furthermore acts to suppress @xmath77 by @xmath32 , where @xmath78 for the polonyi field we have @xmath79 since @xmath73 .",
    "thus @xmath80 turns out to be the dominant part in susy breakdown whereas @xmath77 appears as being suppressed by a factor as given in eq.([eqn : suppression ] ) .",
    "the mass of the dilaton field is expressed as @xmath81 where the second derivative of the scalar potential has the behavior @xmath82 and thus @xmath83 and the mass of the dilaton is enhanced compared to @xmath84 .",
    "the mass of the polonyi field is @xmath85 which means that it is comparable to the gravitino mass .",
    "this is in accordance with the previous discussion , namely @xmath40 sets the scale of the polonyi field as well as that of the gravitino mass .       and @xmath36 direction with minkowski minimum at @xmath87 . ]     and @xmath36 direction with minkowski minimum at @xmath87 . ]",
    "if we compare this to the type iib case we , in fact , end up with very similar results ( although the starting point was quite different ) . in type",
    "iib one started with a supersymmetric theory in an anti - de sitter vacuum which then gets up - lifted to a minkowski vacuum with susy breakdown induced by the up - lifting sector . in the heterotic case we started with an unstabilized dilaton .",
    "the superpotential interaction involving matter fields provides the stabilization of the dilaton and also induces the breakdown of supersymmetry .",
    "finally a minkowski vacuum can be realized by properly adjusting the parameters of the polonyi sector . the hierarchical structure among @xmath88 , @xmath84 and gaugino masses @xmath89 is @xmath90 this is similar as the result obtained in the type iib case @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "this little hierarchy has its origin in the appearance of the factor @xmath91 .",
    "it suppresses the modulus contribution to the soft mass terms such that loop induced effects become competitive to the tree level ones .",
    "the result is the so - called mirage pattern of soft mass terms .",
    "having presented the set - up we would like to analyze in detail the pattern of the emerging soft terms in the effective low energy theory .",
    "first we derive the soft breaking terms as boundary conditions valid at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale with a suitable parameterization .",
    "we then evolve these soft terms down to the electroweak ( ew ) scale and impose several phenomenological constraints of theoretical and experimental nature .",
    "our analysis in section  [ sub : combination ] was done in the framework of the polonyi model . following the lines of @xcite one",
    "can also construct generalized superpotentials for which the soft terms take a simpler form .",
    "in particular we are interested in a simple pattern for the gaugino masses . for a more general discussion see @xcite . in order to simplify the discussion we thus assume that the minimum of the scalar potential emerges at @xmath87 and @xmath92 .",

    "furthermore we assume that the string threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic function involving the @xmath36 field are negligible at @xmath96 . the moduli / dilaton mediated contribution to the soft terms",

    "<S> it requires a gaugino condensate and an up - lifting sector similar to the one postulated in type iib string theory . </S>",
    "<S> its signature is a hybrid mediation of supersymmetry breakdown with a variant of a mirage pattern for the soft breaking terms . </S>",
    "<S> the set - up is suited for the discussion of heterotic mssm candidates . </S>"
