    "the generation of nonclassical states of light is one of the primary research areas in quantum optics .",
    "in particular , the preparation of _ entangled states _ of light has attracted a considerable amount of attention recently , since these states have been identified as a key resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "other interesting applications of the entangled states include , for instance , ultra - high precision measurements @xcite and quantum optical lithography @xcite .",
    "the range of interactions between light fields that are experimentally accessible and feasible is rather limited , which restricts the class of quantum states of the optical field that can be generated in the lab .",
    "however , this class can be significantly extended if one considers probabilistic generation schemes , whose success is conditioned on the detection of a particular outcome of a measurement performed on some ancilla system .",
    "schemes for probabilistic preparation of fock states @xcite , arbitrary superpositions of fock states of single - mode field @xcite , and superpositions of classically distinguishable states ( schrdinger - cat - like states ) @xcite , have been found .",
    "several setups for the generation of two - mode @xmath0-photon path - entangled states have been suggested @xcite .",
    "recently , the experimental conditional preparation of a single - photon fock state with negative wigner function has been reported @xcite .    however , all the above mentioned schemes are still quite restrictive since they are capable to prepare only single - mode states or only a particular class of two - mode states ( such as the @xmath0-photon states ) . in this paper",
    ", we design a truly _ universal _ scheme that can be used to probabilistically generate an _",
    "arbitrary _ multimode entangled state of light , provided that each mode does not contain more than @xmath0 photons , where @xmath0 is an arbitrary but finite integer .",
    "the resources required for the present scheme comprise the passive linear optical elements ( beam splitters and phase shifters ) , single photon sources , strong coherent laser beams , and photodetectors .",
    "it was shown recently that these resources are sufficient for performing universal quantum computing @xcite .",
    "our proposal provides another illustration of the surprising versatility and power of such an approach , relying only on linear optics and single photons . in this context",
    "it is worth mentioning that , very recently , clausen _ et al .",
    "_ suggested a scheme for approximate conditional implementation of general single- or multi - mode operators acting on states of traveling optical field @xcite .",
    "the scheme described in @xcite is also based on linear optics and may be in principle used for ( approximate ) quantum state preparation .",
    "we emphasize that the approach proposed in the present paper conceptually differs from that of ref .",
    "we are primarily interested in exact state preparation and our setup is specifically tailored for that purpose .",
    "we will first explain all the essential features of the state - preparation procedure on the simplest yet nontrivial example of two - mode entangled state that is formed by a superposition of two product states , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a normalization factor .",
    "then we will generalize the preparation procedure and design a scheme for the generation of arbitrary multimode entangled states of light .",
    "we note in passing that even the simple entangled states ( [ target ] ) may find applications in the investigations of the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , it was shown recently that the states of the form ( [ target ] ) yield a strong violation of bell - chsh inequalities when alice and bob perform balanced homodyne measurements followed by an appropriate binning @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we propose a method to probabilistically generate the two - mode entangled state ( [ target ] ) with the help of passive linear optics , single photon sources , strong coherent laser fields and photodetectors . in section",
    "iii we shall extend our scheme to allow for more than two modes and more than two terms in the superposition .",
    "we will thus design a universal device that enables one to conditionally prepare an arbitrary multimode state of light .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "let us first note that , in order to simplify the notation , we shall omit the normalization factors in front of the quantum states in what follows .",
    "since the state @xmath3 is rather complicated , we divide its preparation into several steps .",
    "the main simplification stems from the observation that the entangled state ( [ target ] ) can be prepared by means of entanglement swapping @xcite if we possess the two three - mode states @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the state of a single photon in spatial mode @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) that is polarized vertically or horizontally , respectively . as shown in fig . 1",
    ", we easily obtain the state ( [ target ] ) from the state @xmath9 if we project the single photons in spatial modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 onto the maximally entangled bell state @xmath10 the generation of state ( [ target ] ) thus boils down to the preparation of the entangled state ( [ targetsp ] ) .",
    "[ state ( [ targetspprime ] ) can be prepared similarly ] .",
    "this latter task will be accomplished with the help of a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement of a single photon , which creates entanglement .",
    "the proposed setup is depicted in fig .",
    "the input polarization modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 are prepared in the pure single - mode states @xmath13 and @xmath14 that contain no more than @xmath15 photons , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the @xmath18-photon fock state",
    ". the states ( [ fgtildeexpansion ] ) are , of course , closely related to the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ targetsp ] ) . the exact relationship between them will be specified later .",
    "note that it was shown by dakna _",
    "_ @xcite that the single - mode states ( [ fgtildeexpansion ] ) can be probabilistically generated with the help of passive linear optics , single photon sources , strong coherent laser pulses and photodetectors with single photon sensitivity .    as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the input beam containing the states @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 polarization modes impinges on a beam splitter @xmath23 with transmittance @xmath24 and reflectance @xmath25 .",
    "the purpose of this beam splitter is to separate a single photon from one of the input states and thus create entanglement .",
    "of course , @xmath23 may split more than one photon or no photon at all .",
    "therefore we must verify that there is exactly a single photon present in the output spatial mode @xmath26 , without disturbing its polarization state .",
    "such qnd measurements of a single photon have been recently thoroughly discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where several schemes have been proposed and analyzed .",
    "one possible method relies on teleportation @xcite . with the help of the conditional c - not gate for photonic qubits",
    "@xcite we have to first prepare the singlet state @xmath27 in the auxiliary modes @xmath28",
    ". then we teleport the polarization state of a photon in mode @xmath26 onto the photon in mode @xmath29 by performing a bell measurement on modes @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "this measurement should be carried out with two detectors that are capable to resolve the number of photons .",
    "if exactly two photons are detected in coincidence at the two detectors , then we know that there was a single photon in mode @xmath26 and its polarization state has been coherently transfered onto the state of a single photon in mode @xmath29 .    kok _ et al . _ also proposed qnd measurement schemes that do not require a - priori entanglement @xcite . for our purposes it suffices to employ the simple interferometric scheme depicted in fig .",
    "3 which performs a partial qnd photon number measurement . the coincident detection of a single photon in detectors @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 indicates that there was at least one photon in the input mode .",
    "moreover , if there was _ exactly _ a single photon at the input , then its polarization state is unperturbed by the measurement .",
    "the probability of successful qnd measurement of a single photon provided that there _ is _ a single photon in the spatial mode @xmath26 is equal to @xmath33 . in the preparation scheme shown in fig .",
    "1 the two qnd measurements are followed by the entanglement swapping that succeeds only if each photodetector in fig . 1 detects exactly one photon . in this way we select the events when there is exactly a single photon in each mode @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the state after the qnd measurement can be written in the form @xmath34 where the non - unitary operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 describe removal of none or a single photon at @xmath37 , respectively , @xmath38      the qnd measurement has thus created the entanglement . still , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are states of two different polarization modes while @xmath41 and @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ targetsp ] ) are states of a _ single _ mode .",
    "we achieve this by erasing the information about the polarization .",
    "this is done with the help of a polarizing beam splitter @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "the beam splitter is rotated such that it combines the @xmath21 and @xmath22 polarizations .",
    "if we associate the annihilation operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 with the modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , then the transformation carried out by @xmath43 is given by @xmath46 where the polarization modes @xmath47 and @xmath48 are _ spatially separated _ at the output of @xmath43 as indicated in fig .",
    "2 . the erasing succeeds if and only if the detector @xmath49 placed on the @xmath48 mode does not detect any photon , which ensures that all photons have been transmitted to the linearly polarized output mode @xmath47 .",
    "since the input states do not contain more than @xmath15 photons each and since a single photon was subtracted on @xmath23 , the state after erasure of the polarization information reads @xmath50 where the output complex amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 are given by the following formula , @xmath53    it follows that we can fix the values of output coefficients @xmath51 by properly choosing the complex amplitudes of the input states .",
    "we have the recurrence equations @xmath54 and a similar formula holds for @xmath55 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath56 and @xmath55 are calculated as follows .",
    "first , some nonzero values for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are chosen .",
    "then one uses repeatedly eq .",
    "( [ inoutsolution ] ) to calculate @xmath56 and @xmath55 from @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and the iterations stop at @xmath62 .",
    "we have thus almost obtained the state ( [ targetsp ] ) .",
    "however , while the effective states @xmath41 and @xmath42 in ( [ psierasure ] ) have the correct structure in the subspace spanned by the first @xmath15 fock states @xmath63 , they also contain an unwanted tail in the subspace spanned by the fock states @xmath64 .",
    "the last step in our scheme is to get rid of that tail .",
    "we do so with the help of the quantum scissors @xcite that will project the state in the mode @xmath65 onto the subspace spanned by the first @xmath15 fock states .",
    "this action is formally described by the projector @xmath66 ) in the output modes 1 and 2 of our device .",
    "the quantum scissors have been discussed in detail in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "the schemes proposed there can be implemented with the use of linear optics , single photon sources , and photodetectors .",
    "the setup that we shall consider in the present paper is depicted in fig .",
    "the modes @xmath26 and @xmath30 are prepared in a pure @xmath0-photon two - mode entangled state @xmath67 it was shown recently that these states may be conditionally generated with the help of linear optics , single photon sources and photodetectors @xcite .",
    "we then combine the modes @xmath65 and @xmath26 on a balanced beam splitter and measure the number of photons in output modes @xmath65 and @xmath26 by means of two photodetectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 with single - photon resolution .",
    "the truncation is a conditional operation that succeeds when certain particular measurement outcome has been detected , say , no photons at @xmath31 and @xmath0 photons at @xmath32 , which we denote as @xmath68 .",
    "note , that one could also consider other detection events , but the total number of photons detected by the photodetectors should be equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the quantum scissors is essentially a quantum state teleportation in the subspace of the first @xmath15 fock states , where the state ( [ psiscissors ] ) serves as the quantum channel , and the bell - type measurement is carried out with the use of the beam splitter in fig .",
    "4 that couples the modes @xmath65 and @xmath26 .    for our particular choice of the detection event @xmath68 , and assuming a balanced beam splitter",
    ", we find that @xmath69 should hold , where @xmath70 is the probability of the successful quantum - state truncation that projects onto the subspace spanned by @xmath71 .",
    "so far we have considered the generation of a two - mode state that consists of a superposition of two product states . in this section",
    "we shall generalize our scheme in several ways .",
    "first , we will discuss the preparation of a @xmath72-mode entangled state which has a form limited to the superposition of two product states , namely @xmath73 to prepare this state , we first generate @xmath72 states @xmath74 as before , and then project the @xmath72 single photons onto the maximally entangled state @xmath75 this projection can be performed with the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state analyzer described by pan and zeilinger @xcite .",
    "this analyzer consists of polarizing beam splitters and half - wave plates and allows one to distinguish two ghz states of m qubits .",
    "our second generalization extends the preparation procedure to two - mode states that are superpositions of @xmath76 product states , @xmath77 obviously , a natural strategy is to prepare this state via @xmath76-dimensional entanglement swapping from two states of the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes a state of a single photon in the @xmath80th auxiliary spatial mode . to prepare the states ( [ psiquditsp ] ) , we proceed essentially as in sec .",
    "the extended scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "5 . initially ,",
    "@xmath76 spatial modes are prepared in states @xmath81 .",
    "the array of @xmath76 beam splitters @xmath82 extracts , with a certain probability , a single photon .",
    "we must verify the presence of exactly one single photon in total in the modes @xmath83 while preserving the coherence among these modes by performing a qnd measurement .",
    "this can be accomplished by @xmath76-dimensional teleportation similarly as discussed in section ii .",
    "however , this time we need to teleport a qudit encoded as a state of a single photon in @xmath76 spatial modes .",
    "fortunately , it was shown recently that the probabilistic gates for quantum computing with linear optics @xcite , that were introduced for qubits , can be easily extended to qudits @xcite .",
    "this means that all the necessary manipulations , such as the generation of maximally entangled state of two qudits and the bell measurement , can be probabilistically carried out with the resources that we assume here .",
    "after the qnd measurement , we must erase the spatial information contained in the resulting state @xmath84 where @xmath85 are given by eq .",
    "( [ b01operators ] ) .",
    "this is done by the second array of @xmath86 beam splitters indicated by the shaded zone in fig .",
    "the preparation is finished by the application of the quantum scissors , that truncate the fock state expansion of the output state at @xmath0 photons .",
    "suppose that the output mode after erasing is a balanced linear superposition of all @xmath76 modes @xmath87 the complex amplitudes of the states @xmath88 can then be expressed in terms of the complex amplitudes of the input states @xmath89 as follows @xmath90 where the prime indicates summation over all @xmath91 satisfying the constraint @xmath92 .",
    "note that the formula ( [ finoutglobal ] ) may be easily inverted and we can determine the complex amplitudes @xmath93 of the input states for any given prescribed output states @xmath94 .      finally , we point out that those two generalizations can be combined and we can thus generate an arbitrary multimode entangled state of light where each mode contains no more than @xmath0 photons .",
    "any @xmath72-mode state of this kind can be written as a superposition of no more than @xmath95 product states , @xmath96 note that the norm of each product state in the superposition ( [ superposition ] ) may be arbitrary .",
    "we can conditionally generate the state ( [ superposition ] ) if we first prepare @xmath72 entangled states ( @xmath97 ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes a single photon state of the @xmath100-th auxiliary spatial mode . as discussed above , the states ( [ superpositionsp ] )",
    "can be prepared with the help of the scheme depicted in fig .",
    ", we carry out a joint measurement on all auxiliary photons .",
    "the state @xmath101 is obtained if we project the auxiliary modes onto an @xmath72-photon ghz entangled state : @xmath102 if we denote @xmath103 then we can write @xmath104      the above described procedure for the preparation of the generic @xmath72-mode entangled state clearly shows that our approach is indeed general since it allows us , in principle , to generate an arbitrary state .",
    "but the success probability of the scheme will be exponentially small in general .",
    "the preparation procedure will therefore have to be repeated exponentially many times to produce the desired state . in the rest of this section",
    "we shall argue that the number of operations required to produce the desired state can be significantly decreased if a quantum memory is available .",
    "the situation is similar to that analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the operations required to produce `` cat states '' was drastically decreased by using a recursive procedure that uses a quantum memory .",
    "the advantage of the quantum memory is that it allows one to wait until successive steps in the state generation protocol have succeeded before proceeding with the next steps .",
    "for instance in the scheme described in fig . 5 , one can first produce the states @xmath81 and store them in a memory before proceeding with the production of the entangled state ( [ psiquditsp ] ) .",
    "suppose that the state @xmath109 can be prepared with the probability @xmath110 . without quantum memory the probability of simultaneous preparation of the @xmath76 states",
    "@xmath109 is @xmath111 and the number of required operations thus scales as @xmath112 .",
    "if , after a successful preparation , we store each state @xmath13 in a memory , we reduce the number of required operations to @xmath113 .",
    "a more elaborate use of a quantum memory is to build the state using a _ recursive procedure _ based on the schmidt decomposition .",
    "the method is best explained on an explicit example .",
    "suppose we would like to prepare a four - mode state @xmath114 .",
    "the schmidt decomposition of this four - mode state with respect to a bi - partite splitting into the @xmath115 and @xmath116 modes can be written as follows , @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 form orthogonal bases in some subspaces of the hilbert space of modes @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the number of the terms in the schmidt decomposition ( [ schmidt ] ) is bounded by @xmath120 while , in general , @xmath121 terms were necessary in the general procedure of section iiic .",
    "the decomposition ( [ schmidt ] ) suggests that we could obtain the state @xmath114 via entanglement swapping if we first prepare two entangled states @xmath122 now the entangled states @xmath123 and @xmath124 can be prepared using the general procedure of sec .",
    "however , for states of the specific form ( [ abx ] ) , a simpler procedure can be devised .",
    "one first generates @xmath76 states @xmath125 where the tilde indicates that @xmath126 is related to @xmath127 via relations similar to those described by eqs .",
    "( [ inoutsolution ] ) .",
    "the state @xmath123 is then prepared with the help of the device shown in fig .",
    "5 where the mode @xmath128 of @xmath125 is sent to the @xmath80th input port of the interferometer .",
    "the only modification is that we must also erase the spatial information carried by the @xmath129 modes of the states @xmath125 and perform the quantum state truncation after the erasing .",
    "briefly , all @xmath76 modes @xmath130 are combined on an array of @xmath86 beam splitters and the detectors monitor the first @xmath86 output ports .",
    "if these detectors do not register any photon , then the erasing procedure succeeded and we apply the quantum scissors to the state in the @xmath76th output port .    clearly , this recursive procedure can be extended to any number of modes .",
    "the resulting scheme resembles a tree structure involving repeated applications of the entangling scheme shown in fig .",
    "5 and the entanglement swapping that produces an @xmath131-mode state from two @xmath132-mode states entangled with auxiliary single photons .",
    "this scheme relying on quantum memory may possibly lead to a substantial improvement of the generation probability , similarly to the case of the two - mode @xmath0-photon cat states @xcite .",
    "in summary , the scheme proposed in the present paper is universal in that arbitrary multimode entangled states of light can be probabilistically generated .",
    "the resources required are passive linear optics , single photon sources , strong coherent states , and detectors with single - photon resolution .",
    "this result clearly illustrates the versatility and power of the approach relying only on linear optics and single photons .",
    "it is fair to say , though , that the suggested setup is rather complicated and involves several nontrivial operations such as the quantum non - demolition measurement of a single photon , quantum scissors , and transformations of photonic qudits encoded as a state of a single photon in @xmath76 spatial modes .",
    "we have shown that all these operations can be ( probabilistically ) implemented with the resources that we consider here .",
    "the resulting procedure may become very complex for general states .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that building a state like ( [ superposition ] ) must necessarily be complicated because of the large number of parameters [ @xmath133 complex numbers ] that characterize this state and that must be fixed by the preparation scheme .",
    "we have also argued that the use of a quantum memory can decrease the number of operations required to produce the desired state .",
    "we hope that this paper will stimulate the efforts towards experimental demonstrations of the basic building blocks of our scheme , such as the conditional generation of single - mode finite superpositions of fock states and the preparation of two - mode entangled @xmath0-photon states required for the quantum state truncation .",
