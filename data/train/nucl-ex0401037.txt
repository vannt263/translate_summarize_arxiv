    "two particle intensity interferometry ( hbt ) is a useful tool to study the space - time geometry of the particle emitting source in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it also contains dynamical information that can be explored by studying the transverse momentum dependence of the apparent source size @xcite .",
    "extracted parameters in hbt analysis from au+au collisions at = 130 gev at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) did not agree with predictions of hydrodynamic models that gave an almost perfect description of the momentum - space structure of the emitting source and elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "this  hbt puzzle \" could originate from the fact that the extracted timescales ( _ emission duration _ from the @xmath0 ratio and _ evolution duration _ from the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 ) are smaller than those predicted by the hydrodynamical model @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present two - pion correlation systematics as a function of the transverse total mass ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and multiplicity in au+au collisions at = 200 gev produced by rhic at brookhaven national laboratory and measured by the star detector .",
    "we also discuss a fitting procedure in which the strength of the final state coulomb interaction between the two charged pions is taking into account in the fit itself .",
    "experimentally , two - particle correlations are studied by constructing the correlation function @xmath5(*q * )  =  a(*q*)/b(*q * ) . here a(*q",
    "* ) is the measured distribution of the momentum difference * q *  =  @xmath6  -  @xmath7 for pairs of particles from the same event , and b(*q * ) is the corresponding distribution for pairs of particles from different events . for this analysis we selected events with a collision vertex position within @xmath825  cm measured from the center of the 4  m long star time projection chamber ( tpc ) , and we mixed events only if their longitudinal primary vertex positions were no farther apart than 5  cm .",
    "we divided our sample into six centrality bins , where the centrality was characterized according to the measured multiplicity of charged particles at midrapidity .",
    "the six centrality bins correspond to 0 - 5@xmath9 ( most central ) , 5 - 10@xmath9 , 10 - 20@xmath9 , 20 - 30@xmath9 , 30 - 50@xmath9 and 50 - 80@xmath9 ( most peripheral ) of the total hadronic cross section .",
    "charged pions were identified by correlating their specific ionization in the gas of the tpc with their measured momentum @xcite .",
    "the effects of track - splitting ( reconstruction of a single track as two tracks ) and track - merging ( two tracks with similar momenta reconstructed as a single track ) were eliminated as described in @xcite .",
    "a new procedure to take into account final state coulomb interaction is described in the next section .    the effect of the single - particle momentum resolution ( @xmath10p / p @xmath11 1@xmath9 for pions ) induces systematic underestimation of the hbt parameters . using an iterative procedure @xcite",
    ", we corrected our correlation functions for finite resolution effects .",
    "the correction due to the uncertainty on the removal of the artificial reduction of the hbt parameters associated with the anti - merging cut has been calculated in @xcite and is included as systematic error .",
    "the three - dimensional correlation functions were generated .",
    "the relative momentum was measured in the longitudinal co - moving system ( lcms ) frame , and decomposed according to the pratt - bertsch @xcite  out - side - long \" parametrization .",
    "there is a coulomb interaction between emitted particles that needs to be taken into account in order to isolate the bose - einstein interaction .",
    "this coulomb interaction , repulsive for like - sign particles , causes a reduction on the number of real pairs at low q , reducing the correlation function . in our previous analysis @xcite as well as in previous experiments ,",
    "this was corrected by applying a pair coulomb correction to each pair in the background @xcite corresponding to a spherical gaussian source of a given radius ; we call this _ standard _ procedure .",
    "the correlation function was then fit with the functional form : c(@xmath12 ,  @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 )  =  @xmath15  =  1  + @xmath16  @xmath17(-@xmath18  @xmath19  -  @xmath20  @xmath21  -  @xmath22  @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 is the square of the coulomb wave - function .",
    "however , this procedure overcorrects the correlation function since all background pairs are corrected , including those that are not formed by primary pions .",
    "we have implemented a new procedure , first suggested by bowler @xcite and sinyukov @xcite and recently used by the ceres collaboration @xcite , in which the strength of the coulomb interaction is taken into account in the fit itself and only pairs with bose - einstein interaction are considered to coulomb interact ; we call this _ bowler - sinyukov _ procedure .",
    "the fit in this case is : c(@xmath12 ,  @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 )  =  @xmath25  =  ( 1-@xmath16 )  + @xmath26(-@xmath18  @xmath19  -  @xmath20  @xmath21  -  @xmath22  @xmath23 ) ) , where @xmath24 is the same as above .            in figure",
    "[ qinvcf ] , the measured @xmath27 correlation function is compared to several calculations .",
    "lines indicate the _ standard _ ( @xmath28 ) and _ bowler - sinyukov _",
    "( @xmath29 ) coulomb functions ; in the latter , @xmath16 was extracted from the fit to the 3d like - sign correlation function .",
    "clearly , the _ bowler - sinyukov _ function better reproduces the data .",
    "further improvement is observed when the strong interaction ( negligible for like - sign pion correlations ) is included @xcite into the @xmath27 final state interactions .",
    "when we use this procedure in our 3d analysis we observe an increase in @xmath30 of 10 - 15@xmath9 .",
    "the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not depend significantly on the coulomb procedure .",
    "consequently the increase in @xmath0 is not enough to solve the hbt puzzle .",
    "figure [ hbtradii ] shows the @xmath1 dependence of the source parameters for pions at six centrality bins from au+au collisions as well as from p+p and d+au collisions at same beam energy .",
    "the three radii increase with increasing centrality and @xmath2 varies similar to @xmath30 and @xmath33 ; for @xmath30 and @xmath33 this increase may be attributed to the geometrical overlap of the two nuclei .",
    "the extracted radii rapidly decrease as a function of @xmath1 , which is an indication of transverse flow @xcite . in order to extract information about the @xmath1 dependence on centrality",
    ", we fit the @xmath1 dependence of each radius and each centrality to a power - law function : @xmath34 ( solid lines in figure [ hbtradii ] ) .",
    "figure [ alpha ] shows the dependence of @xmath35 on the number of participants ; for au+au , @xmath35 is constant for @xmath2 as a function of number of participants and decreases with the number of participants for @xmath30 and @xmath33 for the most peripheral bins indicating a decrease of transverse flow for these collisions .",
    "@xmath36 1 which indicates a short emission duration in a blast wave fit @xcite .     radius for a transverse gaussian density profile @xcite for p+p , d+au and 6 different centralities in au+au collisions , scaledwidth=65.0% ]     radius for a transverse gaussian density profile @xcite for p+p , d+au and 6 different centralities in au+au collisions , scaledwidth=65.0% ]    assuming boost - invariant longitudinal flow we can extract an evolution time - scale by using a simple fit @xcite : @xmath37 where t is the freeze - out temperature and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the modified bessel functions of order 1 and 2 . for t extracted from fits to pion , kaon , and proton transverse momentum spectra ( 90 mev for most central and 120 mev for most peripheral collisions ) @xcite we get @xmath40 9 fm / c for central events and @xmath40 6 fm / c for peripheral events .",
    "hence , the evolution time , in addition to the emission duration , is quite short .    for a transverse expanding , longitudinally boost - invariant source , and assuming a gaussian transverse density profile",
    ", we can extract information about its radius , @xmath41 , by fitting the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath33 to : @xmath42 where t is again the freeze - out temperature and @xmath43 is the surface transverse rapidity @xcite . for t and @xmath43",
    "consistent with spectra we see an increase on this radius from @xmath115 fm for the most peripheral case to @xmath1113 fm for the most central one as shown in figure [ rgeom ] .",
    "we also observe a smooth transition from p+p ( @xmath44 = 2 ) and d+au ( @xmath44 = 8.3 ) to au+au collisions .",
    "we have presented identical pion interferometry results for au+au collisions at = 200 gev . with respect to multiplicity and @xmath1 dependencies , pion",
    "hbt radii are very similar to results reported at = 130 gev .",
    "hbt radii and geometrical radius increase with increasing centrality .",
    "hbt radii decrease with @xmath1 and we observe a stronger flow for the most central collisions .",
    "our results indicate that both the evolution timescale ( as measured by the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 ) and the emission duration ( probed by comparing @xmath30 to @xmath33 ) are surprisingly fast .",
    "the bowler - sinyukov coulomb procedure does not solve the  hbt puzzle \" although increases the ratio @xmath0 by 10 - 15% .",
