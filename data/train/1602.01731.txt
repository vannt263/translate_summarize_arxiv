    "recent years , the traffic demand in mobile networks has been growing exponentially due to the evolution of smart phones , applications such as web browsing , video streaming etc . , and number of subscriptions .",
    "it has been estimated that by 2020 , there would be 10 billion mobile devices thereby resulting an 11 fold increase in capacity compared with what they are experiencing today @xcite . to cater to the increased service requirements ,",
    "a large number of base stations ( bss ) are being deployed .",
    "recent studies show that the number of bss worldwide has doubled from 2007 to 2012 , and the number of bss as of today has reached more than 4 million @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the energy consumption in cellular networks increases tremendously leading to an increase in the carbon footprint which leads to global warming @xcite .",
    "a recent study show that by the end of 2012 , the amount of co@xmath0 emissions from bs towers has reached 78 million tons @xcite . reducing energy consumption is an important concern for network operators as it leads to lower operational expenditure ( opex ) costs @xcite .",
    "several approaches are being considered by the cellular operators to reduce energy consumption both at a component and at a network level @xcite .",
    "there have been several international research projects ( earth @xcite , operanet @xcite , and ewin @xcite ) that are being carried out to improve energy efficiency in wireless systems .",
    "it is seen that 60 - 80% of the power consumption in cellular networks is at the radio access network ( ran ) , mainly at the bss @xcite . at component level , using advanced design of power amplifiers , reconfigurable circuits , and downlink discontinuous transmission ( dtx ) techniques , only a small amount of energy saving ( es ) can be achieved @xcite . however , at the network level , significant energy saving ( es ) can be achieved by efficient design of network during planning and management phases @xcite .    during cell dimensioning phase ,",
    "the bss are usually deployed considering peak traffic demand and future traffic growth .",
    "however , studies show that most of the time the bss are largely underutilized due to spatial and temporal variations in traffic conditions @xcite .",
    "it is studied that about @xmath1 of time in a day , the traffic is below @xmath2 of the peak @xcite .",
    "power consumption at the bs is composed of two parts : fixed and dynamic . fixed power consumption is due to cooling , signal processing etc . , and is independent of traffic load .",
    "it has been seen that the fixed part constitutes @xmath3 of the total power consumption at full load condition @xcite .",
    "dynamic power consumption is due to the rf transmission and varies with traffic load . during low traffic load conditions , operating",
    "under - utilized bss leads to severe degradation of area energy efficiency ( aee ) [ number of bits transmitted per joule per unit area ( unit : bits / joule / m@xmath4 ) ] performance due to fixed part of power consumption .",
    "therefore , during off - peak hours , putting under - utilized bss to sleep mode ( slm ) is considered as a promising approach for potential energy savings @xcite , thereby increasing aee performance . in slm , the underutilized bs is switched off and the users associated with it are attached to neighbouring bss . moreover , for the purpose of activating / deactivating the bss , distributed and centralized es functionalities have been included in 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) standard @xcite .",
    "although putting bss into slm reduces energy consumption significantly , it has some practical implications . in current cellular systems",
    "the bss are equipped with several ( typically three ) directional antennas , each radiating within a specified orientation ( sector ) .",
    "therefore , during cell dimensioning phase , the bs locations and ran parameters ( transmit power , antenna height , tilt angle ) are optimized in order to meet various system performance metrics such as coverage , capacity , overlap , quality of service ( qos ) etc @xcite .",
    "switching off certain number of bss may affect these basic system requirements .",
    "for instance , it may result in coverage holes .",
    "the interference pattern and signal to interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) experienced by the users may be deteriorated due to change in network configuration .",
    "therefore , proper coverage estimation has to be performed before selecting bss for slm .    in order to support hand - overs ,",
    "it is required to ensure reception of signals from more than one bs @xcite particularly for the users at the cell edge regions .",
    "this means that some amount of overlapping of the coverage region of remaining active bss has to be ensured . at the same time",
    "an excess amount of overlap may significantly increase inter - cell interference ( ici ) from the neighbouring cells especially in single frequency networks ( sfns ) such as long term evolution ( lte ) and worldwide interoperability for microwave access ( wimax ) .",
    "this increase in ici would degrade the sinr experienced by the users . as a consequence",
    ", the capacity may reduce significantly as the capacity of a cell depends on the sinr experienced by the users in that cell .",
    "therefore , an excess amount of overlap should be controlled in order to keep ici within the acceptable level .",
    "further , after switching off certain bss , the remaining set of active cells should not be overloaded as it would lead to increased blocking ( or poor grade of service ) in those cells . at the same time",
    ", the remaining active bss should have sufficient resources to serve the offered traffic demand .",
    "moreover , it is also important to take into account the dynamics of ici due to switching off certain bss as it has direct impact on the performance metrics .",
    "for example , sinr is affected by the radio resource occupancy in neighbouring cells due to varying co - channel interference pattern .",
    "the radio resource occupancy in the neighbouring cells is dependent upon the offered traffic load in those cells .",
    "after slm , with the new set of active bss , the non - uniform ran parameter configurations and inhomogeneous traffic load lead to non - uniform interference scenarios across the network .",
    "therefore , better estimate of system performance metrics such as coverage and capacity is required to exploit the full potential of the radio resources .",
    "overall , the subset of bss to be put into slm should be identified such that it meets the following requirements .    *",
    "the remaining active bs set provides sufficient coverage , capacity , and overlap requirements with minimal energy consumption .",
    "however , the above mentioned performance metrics are tightly coupled with each other due to complex interference patterns .",
    "therefore , improving ( or reducing ) one metric may end up in degrading the performance of the others .",
    "hence , while finding the appropriate bs subset for bs slm , it is important to consider the trade - offs among these performance metrics .",
    "* traffic reorientation is required without major changes in blocking or cell overloading to ensure qos or capacity is not affected . * along with the new set of bss , it is required to reconfigure the ran parameters ( bs transmit power , bs antenna height , and antenna s vertical tilt angle ) as well . *",
    "it is also required to study the inter - relationships between different performance metrics in order to utilize the energy efficiency gains due to bs slm in current and future cellular systems . *",
    "finding an optimal subset of bss and ran parameters with good trade - offs between the system performance metrics is a challenging optimization problem @xcite because it involves huge search space due to a large scale of mobile networks .",
    "* since the requirements of the network differs with fast as well as slow traffic variations @xcite , the solution approach should provide appropriate solutions at faster time scales with minimal computational complexity .    in the line of above discussion , in this work",
    ", we develop a multi - objective optimization framework for efficient utilization of network resources through bs slm .",
    "the motivation for multi - objective optimization is discussed in the next section .",
    "the problem of radio network planning for 2 g and 3 g cellular systems considering multi - objective optimization has been addressed in @xcite . in @xcite , during initial coverage and capacity planning , multi - objective optimization framework is used to find the bs locations , transmission power of bss and channels per cell . in @xcite , the bs locations required to cover a given geographical region is obtained using multi - objective optimization for universal mobile telecommunications systems ( umts ) networks . in @xcite , the problem of maximizing coverage with minimum number of bss is addressed . in @xcite , a multi - objective framework is proposed for optimizing the number of sites , traffic with minimal interference in radio network design . since , identifying bs locations is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem , the solutions are obtained using meta - heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ( ga ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a meta - heuristic tabu search multi - objective optimization framework is developed for wimax networks to find appropriate bs locations taking into consideration the coverage , interference , and cost criteria . in @xcite , a method based on tabu search based method is used to find the bs locations during initial cell planning considering different objectives such as coverage , site cost , interference , and handover .",
    "however , the above mentioned works do not consider energy saving as a design criteria during initial cell planning .",
    "as it is required to find new set of active bss for different traffic load conditions , the bs slm approach can also be seen as the _ dynamic network planning_. therefore , it is required to consider multiple system objectives such as coverage , capacity , etc .",
    ", as is done during initial cell planning . during initial cell planning , as detailed in the above mentioned works , the objective is to find the _ location of bss _ that provides maximum coverage , capacity and minimum interference for a peak traffic condition .",
    "whereas , the bs slm problem is different from the initial cell planning in the sense that in dynamic network planning , it is required to find the subset of bss ( @xmath5 ) and ran parameters from an already deployed bs set ( @xmath6 ) . in this work ,",
    "we treat the problem as a dynamic optimization various system objectives according to spatial and temporal traffic variations .",
    "the related works are detailed in the next section .",
    "there have been several studies concerning es using bs slm .",
    "a recent survey article @xcite lists the relevant works on bs slm . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have studied the amount of possible es through bs slm . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have studied es with bs slm in orthogonal frequency devision multiple access ( ofdma ) based cellular networks using stochastic geometry . in @xcite , a distributed switching on / off scheme based on the mean and variance of traffic profiles is proposed . in @xcite ,",
    "a ga based algorithm is proposed with a single objective of minimizing the number of bss . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have proposed a bs switching off strategy where the set of bss are activated from the predefined network pattern according to the offered traffic load . in their work ,",
    "channel outage probability and call blocking probability are used as the qos metrics . in @xcite , greedy - style heuristic algorithms are proposed to find the user association and the set of bss which need to be switched on / off and analyzed trade - off between energy and delay considering elastic traffic . in @xcite , the possibility of es through site - level slm in 3gpp - lte networks is studied using system level simulations . in @xcite , genetic algorithm ( ga ) based approach",
    "is proposed to identify the sites for slm .",
    "most of the above literature on es through bs slm have focused on the single objective of minimizing energy consumption without considering consequences on other metrics such as network coverage , overlap , and qos degradation etc .",
    "the problem is more critical in 4 g and beyond cellular systems which employ single frequency reuse . in @xcite , a multi - objective optimization framework for cell switch - off",
    "is proposed to minimize energy consumption while maximizing system capacity .",
    "further , the dynamics of ici due to slm has not been addressed in the above mentioned works .",
    "for example , in @xcite , ici has been assumed as a static gaussian - like noise .",
    "this is not a valid assumption , because after deactivating certain number of bss , the service area covered by an individual active bss would be different .",
    "so , the sinr experienced by the users attached to those bss would also be different due to change in ici pattern .",
    "the work presented in this paper is an extension of our previous work @xcite . in @xcite , we have proposed a framework for site - level slm without ran parameter optimization . in this work ,",
    "we present sector - level slm along with ran parameter optimization .",
    "further , we used an approach called sum of weighted objectives ( swo ) , to solve the framed multi - objective optimization problem . in swo",
    ", all the objectives are added together with appropriate weight values to form a single objective .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that in order to obtain the best solution one has to find the appropriate weight vector through trial and error method which may take several trails . in this work",
    "we use a different approach , where initially the set of pareto optimal solutions are obtained and then the final solution is selected based on the preferences .      in this work ,",
    "we develop a multi - objective optimization framework to identify an appropriate network configuration ( set of bss and ran parameters ) that maintains good trade - off between various system performance metrics at different traffic load conditions .",
    "the main motivation for the multi - objective optimization framework is that it provides network providers a clear idea about the different options and solutions to achieve optimal network performance .",
    "further , the proposed framework provides flexibility in choosing the objective functions and control variables according to network conditions .      in this work",
    ", we model interference between different cells by statistical approach in order to capture the characteristics of propagation conditions such as shadowing and traffic conditions such as arrival rate . in practice",
    ", the network setup has to be reconfigured for every few minutes to few hours according to traffic variations . during the reconfiguration interval",
    ", one has to capture the variations in ici which occurs due to user movements and call arrivals .",
    "the previous works considered fixed user locations for computing system performance metrics .",
    "computing the system metrics considering fixed user locations may not be able to find the appropriate network configurations .",
    "a possible approach is to perform monte - carlo simulations .",
    "however , it requires high computational complexity and large number of trails to obtain the solutions . as it is required to obtain the solutions in a smaller time scales , monte - carlo simulation based solutions may not be a suitable approach .",
    "the statistical approach helps to accurately compute the system metrics by capturing spatial and temporal variations of the parameters with less computational burden and processing time .",
    "the contributions of the paper are summarized as follows :    * unlike previous works on bs slm , we consider the following four important system objectives : area power consumption ( apc ) minimization , area spectral efficiency ( ase ) maximization , coverage maximization , and overlap minimization while finding an appropriate network configuration ( the sectors and their ran parameters ) in ofdma based cellular networks such as lte and wimax for a given traffic demand density .",
    "we study the inter - relationship between the different system objectives and provide guidelines to achieve best trade - offs between the conflicting objectives .",
    "* unlike previous works , ici is accurately modeled taking into account the large scale fading ( shadowing ) , small scale fading , and load condition in neighbouring cells .",
    "the accuracy of the model is verified through simulations and it is seen that it works for wide range of standard deviation of shadowing and resource utilization ( sub - carrier occupancy ) in neighbouring cells . the objective functions : network coverage , overlap probability , ase , and apc are derived using the developed ici model .",
    "* a cell load model that relates the offered traffic load to the radio resource utilization is developed in this paper .",
    "the model incorporates the traffic characteristics , and the propagation characteristics such as path loss , shadowing , and small scale fading .",
    "the resource utilization and blocking probability in an individual cell is obtained using kaufman roberts algorithm ( kra ) through traffic and sinr statistics which take into account the load condition in the neighbouring cells .",
    "the accuracy of the model is verified through event - driven simulations . *",
    "the framed multi - objective optimization problem in this work is a complex combinatorial problem .",
    "the number of possible bs combinations exponentially increases with the number of sectors .",
    "identifying ran parameter along with the bs configuration adds further complexity .",
    "genetic algorithm ( ga ) based evolutionary approach is used to find solutions of the multi - objective optimization problem .",
    "the advantage of using the proposed framework in dynamically adjusting the network configuration according to varying traffic conditions with reduced complexity is discussed . *",
    "the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on the dense urban micro ( umi ) scenario which include realistic propagation conditions , three dimensional antenna pattern etc .",
    "it is found that for a given traffic demand density , the solutions are converged to a particular region in the search space .",
    "results demonstrate that using the proposed framework , significant amount of es can be achieved while maintaining good trade - offs between the other system objectives at faster convergence and with lower computational complexity .",

    "the number of trx chains is assumed to be one .",
    "the percentage of area covered by an individual sector is @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ sinr_distribution_twc ] shows the cdf of sinr of an individual cell .",
    "it can be seen that the sinr distribution varies from one cell to the other due to an uneven distribution of interference in the network .",
    "it can be seen that the cells @xmath33 and @xmath34 experience poor sinr distribution due to strong co - channel interferers compared to cells @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ bp_twc ] shows the average blocking probability @xmath37 ( from ) experienced by an individual cell for varying traffic demand density .",
    "it can be observed that the blocking probability in cells @xmath33 and @xmath34 is high , even for low traffic density due to poor sinr distribution in those cells .",
    "although the cells @xmath38 and @xmath34 experience similar sinr distribution , the blocking probability performance of cell @xmath34 is significantly worse than cell @xmath38 .",
    "this is because as the sector @xmath34 covers a larger portion of the geographical area , the cumulative traffic demand experienced by the @xmath34-th cell is significantly higher than that of other cells which results in a high blocking probability .",
    "the resource utilization in an individual cell @xmath39 ( obtained from ) for varying traffic demand density is shown in figure [ ru_twc ] .",
    "it can be seen that the resource consumption at sectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 is significantly high , even at low traffic demand densities due to poor sinr and larger coverage regions .",
    "figure 3(e ) shows the apc for increasing traffic demand density . as the traffic demand increases",
    ", the resource consumption at individual sector is seen to increase resulting in increased dynamic part of power consumption and apc according to . with further increase in traffic demand density ,",
    "the apc is seen to saturate at a certain maximum value due to limitation of available resources at the sectors .",
    "figure 3(f ) shows the % network coverage for varying traffic demand density . as the traffic demand increases the activity of sectors on the sub - channels ( @xmath40 in ) increases which translates into an increased ici to neighbouring cells thereby decreasing the sinr performance .",
    "therefore , the overall coverage decreases with increasing traffic demand density . it can be observed that the area covered by @xmath41 and @xmath42 sectors is significantly less than the area covered by @xmath38 sectors for the active sector set @xmath43 .",
    "it can be observed from figure 2(b ) that with @xmath44 blocking probability requirement , the maximum traffic demand density supported by the active sector set @xmath43 is @xmath45 erlang / m@xmath4 . here ,",
    "@xmath46 the corresponding traffic demand supported ( i.e. @xmath47 ) by the cells @xmath48 , and @xmath36 is @xmath49 and @xmath50 erlang , respectively . from figure 2(c ) it can be observed that the corresponding resource utilization in an individual cell is @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "these values are used in the calculation of power consumption at individual sector .",
    "the apc at traffic demand density @xmath53 erlang / m@xmath4 is @xmath54 w / km@xmath4 .    overall ,",
    "from the results it can be concluded that with increasing traffic demand density the apc increases while the coverage and overlap performance decreases .",
    "further , a particular set of active sectors supports up to a certain traffic demand density due to blocking probability constraint .",
    "our objective is to select a active sector set which minimizes apc and overlap and maximizes coverage and ase while satisfying the blocking probability requirements . for a given traffic demand density @xmath19 ,",
    "if a particular active sector set satisfies the blocking probability requirements it will be included in the potential solution set @xmath55 .",
    "for example , the active sector set @xmath43 will be considered as a potential solution for all traffic demand densities less than @xmath56 erlang / m@xmath4 .",
    "for a given traffic demand density , finding the optimal set of sector and ran parameters among a large number of combinations is a complex combinatorial problem . due to its large scalability , dynamic optimization of mobile networks",
    "should be carried out according to the varying traffic load conditions , in a self organized manner , without any manual intervention .",
    "traffic variations usually take place on an hourly basis .",
    "so , the required reconfiguration of the network needs to be done in small ( from several minutes to few hours ) as wells as large time scales ( from few days to few months ) .",
    "the optimization method should be able to adapt these traffic fluctuations and provide the appropriate solutions with minimal computational complexity whenever it is necessary .",
    "the solutions can be obtained by optimizing all the objectives either jointly or individually according to the system requirements , complexity afford - ability , and need of the operator .",
    "typically dynamic optimization of cellular networks involve the following situations :    _ a ) joint optimization of active bs set and ran parameters considering all four objectives : _ joint optimization is required in case of initial cell planning as well as for re - planning due to introduction of addition of sites to serve an increased population in a given geographical region .",
    "further , during instances such as : change of parameters ( minimum received power threshold @xmath57 , minimum sinr threshold @xmath58 ) , addition of a new site , change in coverage , overlap or blocking probability requirements etc . , it may be required to entirely reconfigure the network . in these situations complexity",
    "may not be a major issue as it is required to find the solutions in the large time scales . in case of joint optimization of active sector set and ran parameters",
    "the search space is calculated as follows .",
    "let @xmath59 be the search space which contains all possible active sector configurations with size @xmath60 for example , with six sectors the search space is @xmath61 with length @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65 be the set of values of tilt angles , transmit power , and heights , respectively , available at sector @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the cardinality of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "one particular combination of a set of ran parameters is denoted as @xmath73 the search space for the ran parameter of a particular set of active sectors @xmath5 is @xmath74 here the possible number of combinations of ran parameters in the search space @xmath75 is equal to the product of number of elements in individual ran parameter set i.e. @xmath76 note that the antenna tilt angle can be adjusted either by mechanical or electrical tilt . in electrical tilt , the antenna pattern is adjusted without changing the physical angle of antenna . whereas , mechanical tilt changes the physical angle of the antenna .",
    "finally , the total search space length becomes @xmath77    _ b ) individual optimization of active bs set and ran parameters considering only a subset of objectives : _ if the complexity is a major concern in smaller time scales then individual optimization is the best approach for obtaining the solutions . in this case search space is very much much less than the previous case .",
    "for example , it may be possible that the same number of bss with different set of ran parameters may be able to support the new traffic demand which is slightly higher than the previous demand .",
    "it is also possible that the bs set which provides maximum energy saving may not be able to provide sufficient coverage . in that case",
    "the coverage performance can be improved through ran parameter optimization .      in this section",
    "we provide the details of complexity of the problem in .    _",
    "the multi - objective optimization problem in is np - hard .",
    "_    consider a simplified problem of finding minimum number of bss required to maintain network coverage @xmath78 .",
    "the problem is similar to the minimum disk cover problem where the set of points in the region @xmath10 to be covered with a subset of disks @xmath79 with minimal cardinality .",
    "it is known that the problem is np - hard @xcite .",
    "the minimum disk cover problem is a subset of our problem in .",
    "therefore , the considered multi - objective optimization problem is np - hard .    in section [ solution_approach ] , we discuss the details of solving the multi - objective optimization problem defined in with reduced complexity by utilizing the traffic fluctuations .",
    "as it is seen in the previous section , the four objectives in are conflicting as they are coupled with each other due to the complex relationships among the variables .",
    "so , there can be no single solution that maximizes all the objectives simultaneously .",
    "in general , there is no global optimum to the multi - objective optimization problem in .",
    "let @xmath80 be the objective set which contains all possible combinations of objective values .",
    "therefore , our aim is to obtain the solution that provides the optimum trade - off among the conflicting objectives .",
    "since the objective functions are conflicting , there will be multiple solutions forming a _ pareto optimal set_.    a solution @xmath81 is said to be non - dominated ( pareto optimal ) if , ( i ) there is no other solution dominating the objectives other than @xmath81 . in other words , @xmath82 does not exist .",
    "( ii ) the solution @xmath81 is strictly better than @xmath83 i.e. @xmath84 for at least one objective @xmath85 .",
    "it can be said that a solution is pareto optimal , if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values @xcite .",
    "each solution in the pareto optimal set has certain trade - offs between the objectives . as there will be multiple solutions , from the pareto solution set , network operator has an opportunity to select appropriate bs and ran parameter configuration according to their needs .",
    "there are two ways to solve the framed multi - objective optimization problem . in one approach ,",
    "called sum of weighted objectives ( swo ) , all the objectives are added together with appropriate weight values to form a single objective as is done in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this method is referred to as _ a priori method _ as it is required to assign preferences to the weight vector beforehand . however , in order to obtain the best solution one has to find the appropriate weight vector through trial and error method which may take several trails .",
    "it is also possible that one may not be able to obtain the appropriate weight vector within the required time frame .",
    "therefore , in this work we use a different approach , called _ a posteriori method_. in this approach , first the set of pareto optimal solutions are obtained and then the final solution is selected based on the preferences .",
    "classical optimization techniques are difficult to apply for the considered combinatorial optimization problem due to non - linear relationships between the variables .",
    "further , obtaining the global pareto solution set is a challenging task .",
    "there are a number of search optimization approaches such as simulated annealing , tabu search , ant colony optimization et . for finding the approximate pareto optimal set .",
    "the main disadvantage of these approaches is that they often get stuck at local solutions and do not provide a global pareto set .",
    "whereas , genetic algorithm ( ga ) is well known for obtaining the global pareto optimal solution of the multi - objective optimization problems with much lower complexity @xcite .",
    "this is because ga processes a group of solutions in the search space unlike other methods which process a single solution at a time .",
    "complexity analysis of ga for the current problem is discussed in section [ ga_complexity ] .",
    "in addition , ga does not require complex mathematical functions , rather it requires numerical values also called fitness functions .",
    "the speed of ga can also be improved by parallel implementation of ga @xcite .    in context to the present problem being discussed , the most important advantage of ga is its suitability in applications to dynamic environments .",
    "there are two different approaches that can be used for dynamically adapting ga : _ search based _ and _ memory based _ approaches @xcite .",
    "the details of these approaches are detailed in the next section .",
    "the dynamics of ga can be implemented both in _ online _ mode and _ offline _ mode .",
