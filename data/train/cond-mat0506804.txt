    "the pt calculations of zhang et al . , and asgari et al . ,",
    "show a strong decrease of @xmath12 from the pt values in the ideal 2des . our calculations , using the `` unperturbed-@xmath13 '' approximation , eq .",
    "[ unpertg ] , lead to a @xmath165 which is only slightly reduced by the thickness effect .",
    "this @xmath165 curve is in close to that of asgari et al .",
    "this is clearly a numerical accident . according to asgari et .",
    "al . , the difference between the ideal @xmath12 and @xmath165 increase as @xmath1 increases . in our calculation",
    "using the `` unperturbed-@xmath13 '' approximation , the difference , already quite small , seems to diminish as @xmath1 increases .",
    "in fact , as @xmath1 increases , the ratio @xmath10 of the higfet layer decreases and the thickness effect may be expected to decrease , unless the difference between @xmath12 and @xmath165 is driven by some other effect .",
    "this `` other effect '' is revealed by giving up the `` unperturbed-@xmath13 '' approximation , and using the full thick - layer 2des pair - distribution function at finite @xmath3 , calculated using the chnc , to evaluate the total free energy @xmath166 of the quasi-2d system , and hence the @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ scfmstr ] we display the pdf of the quasi-2des of a higfet at @xmath47 , and compare it with the pdf of the ideal 2des .",
    "the difference between the ideal and quasi systems is embodied in the form factor @xmath68 .",
    "the reduced coulomb repulsion at small-@xmath84 leads to _ a large pile - up of electrons around the electron at the origin .",
    "_ this means , the electron has to drag this charge pileup and this contributes an enhanced @xmath12 to the thermodynamic and transport properties of the quasi 2des .",
    "the experimental results of tan et .",
    "for @xmath12 show an increase of @xmath155 150% between @xmath1=3 and @xmath167 .",
    "our results from the full chnc calculation , as well as the perturbation results of asgari et al . , are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ scfmstr ] . given the failure of the pt calculations to reproduce the qmc - based @xmath12 for the ideal 2d , it is difficult to evaluate the reliability of the pt - based @xmath165 .",
    "the pt - overestimate of @xmath12 of the ideal 2d is typical of the rpa - like character of these theories which are likely to predict spin transitions at relatively high densities . also , we believe that if the same pt prescriptions were used to evaluate the one - top value @xmath168 of the pdfs of the 2des and the quasi-2des , another measure of the short - comings of the pt methods would be revealed .",
    "the product @xmath157 is given by the ratio of the static spin susceptibility @xmath169 to the ideal ( pauli ) spin susceptibility @xmath170 .",
    "the long wavelength limit of the static response functions are connected with the compressibility or the spin - stiffness via the second derivative of the total energy with respect to the density or the spin polarization@xcite .",
    "de palo et al.@xcite have calculated @xmath157 from the qmc pair distribution functions and shown that they obtain quantitative agreement with the data for very narrow 2-d systems@xcite as well as for the thicker systems found in higfets@xcite .",
    "the chnc pdfs are close approximations to qmc results , and when used in eq .",
    "[ unpertg ] , yield correction energies which are in good agreement with the energies obtained by de palo et al@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the rapid enhancement of @xmath157 in si / sio@xmath14 2des is a consequence of the increase in @xmath12 with @xmath1 , and that the @xmath24 does not increase with @xmath1 because there is _ no spin - phase transition _ in the 2-valley case . in the higfet system",
    "there is a slightly delayed spt , as seen in fig .",
    "[ susfig ] .",
    "hence @xmath157 increases with @xmath1 , while @xmath12 also increases quite rapidly , due to the enhanced `` on - top '' correlations shown ( fig .",

    "we have presented a detailed study of the effect of many - body interactions in quasi-2d electron layers using a single theoretical framework which involves the calculation of the pair - distribution functions of the system via a classical representation of the quantum fluid . a procedure for replacing the inhomogeneous transverse distributions via a constant - density model , i.e. , an equivalent _ homogeneous _ distribution , has also been demonstrated .",
    "easy to use parametrized fit formulae for the exchange energy at zero and finite-@xmath3 have been presented . a simple numerical scheme for calculating the correlation energy of a thick 2d layer , , _ via _ a 3-d slab model combined with a 1-d rod model , has also been demonstrated .",
    "we find that the thickness effect on the spin - phase transition etc .",
    ", provides a clear picture of the changes in the spin - susceptibility enhancement leading to a strong increase in the @xmath13-factor , while @xmath12 is increased due to the enhancement of the `` on - top '' correlations arising from the reduction of the coulomb potential in thick layers .",
    "however , unlike in the case of the effective mass data for si / sio@xmath14 systems@xcite , these results do not provide good quantitative agreement with the effective - mass data for higfets recently reported by tan et al",
