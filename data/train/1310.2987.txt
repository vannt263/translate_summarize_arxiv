    "remarkably , these pumps can always be engineered in such a way to operate reversibly when inserted in any steady state kinetic network .",

    "hyper efficient \" setups which produce finite currents ( and thus finite entropy production ) at the coarse grained level while the real entropy production vanishes .",
    "the origin of this surprising phenomenon is that coarse graining the driving affects the symmetry of the system under time reversal .",
    "entropy production is a measure of the probabilistic distinguishability between a process and its time reversal @xcite . to define the time - reversed process one must consider the time - reversed driving .",
    "but if the information concerning the driving is lost during the coarse graining procedure as is the case here , the time - reversal operation at the coarse grained level does not relate anymore to the real time - reversal operation at the underlying level .",
    "a similar phenomenon may occur if hidden variables which are odd under time reversal are considered , such as velocity , angular momentum , or magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "in fact , an external driving can be implemented by a large mass with a non zero initial velocity @xcite .",
    "our setup has also an intriguing relation with information engines that use the information gathered in a measurement to extract work , in the spirit of the celebrated maxwell demon . in ref .",
    "@xcite a driven kinetic scheme that works as a maxwell demon was introduced . when the demon is coarse grained , the resulting dynamics is markovian and mimics the dynamics of a chemical motor .",
    "the scheme is not able to always work reversibly and it is more restrictive than the one presented here , but the demon is able to run the motor with less entropy production than chemical fuel . in this case , the hidden states are long lifetime states ( with respect to the internal time scale of the motor ) featuring the strong correlation between the motor and the demon implied by the measurement @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to find whether our general scheme also admits an interpretation in terms information .",
    "our pumping mechanism is based on two ingredients , the presence of time asymmetric driving ( an `` odd variables '' ) and a large separation of time scales .",
    "these can yield a dramatic enhancement of the performance of a kinetic network .",
    "it is an open question whether these two ingredients can be helpful for designing more efficient chemical motors and nanodevices or whether they are already present in protein motors and other biological processes .",

    "<S> indications that odd hidden variables do not satisfy this result were analyzed in the context of langevin equations where velocities were coarse grained @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we prove that for systems driven by an external time - dependent force , the entropy production at a coarse grained level of description may overestimate the actual entropy production . </S>",
    "<S> the driving plays the analogous role of an odd hidden variable when it is not invariant under time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit this result to build hyper - efficient pumps . </S>",
    "<S> to do so we consider systems with hidden states driven by an external cyclic time - dependent force generating currents between the apparent states . </S>",
    "<S> the driving is based on adiabatic pumping previously introduced in the literature @xcite but gives rise in our case to a markovian dynamics at the coarse grained level . </S>",
    "<S> we show that our reversible pumps can be used to generate currents again a bias with zero entropy production , without contradicting the second law of thermodynamics . </S>"
