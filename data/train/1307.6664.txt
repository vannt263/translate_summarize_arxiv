    "energy exchange between particles of different species and the subsequent equilibration of their temperatures plays a crucial role in many modern experiments creating high - energy - density matter .",
    "a prime example is inertial confinement fusion where intense lasers are employed to heat and compress a deuterium - tritium pellet to extreme conditions @xcite .",
    "plasmas with well separated electron and ion temperatures are created in the laser spots , the ablator , and the hydrogen pellet itself . in particular , the creation and propagation of the burn wave in the fuel depends on electron - ion temperature equilibration as the main portion of the hydrogen needs to remain cold during compression .",
    "further heating is achieved by @xmath0-particles from the hot spot that , however , transfer their energy almost entirely to the electrons .",
    "fusion conditions are thus only reached after sufficient energy transfer from the electronic to the ionic subsystem .",
    "temperature relaxation is also very important for most experiments dedicated to investigate warm dense matter because a fast energy input into the sample is required to create such a state in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "as the energy is mostly delivered to one species and into special states , samples are often driven into states far from equilibrium .",
    "after a short initial equilibration within each species , the system can be characterised by different electron and ion temperatures . interestingly , ultra - fast probing @xcite allows nowadays to investigate dense plasmas on the time scale of temperature equilibration ( a few pico - seconds ) .",
    "even shorter fs - pulses of intense light as delivered by free electron lasers can further increase the time - resolution or may be used to probe the initial relaxation as well @xcite .",
    "knowledge of the temperature relaxation time is also important when determining equilibrium properties like the equation of state or the structure in equilibrium as it sets a minimum time between creation and probing .    as experimental data for the electron - ion equilibration time",
    "are sparse , one must often rely on theoretical and simulation results for many applications .",
    "the theoretical investigations of electron - ion temperature equilibration can be grouped in two main strains : molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite and quantum kinetics @xcite .",
    "both approaches have their strengths and shortcomings : md simulations are inherently non - perturbative and take into account all channels of energy transfer between the electrons and ions .",
    "however , they are based on classical physics for both the electrons and the ions which strongly restricts their range of applicability .",
    "moreover , the use of electron - ion pseudo - potentials designed to mimic aspects of the quantum behaviour raises basic questions .    quantum statistical theory , on the other hand",
    ", is mostly based on perturbation theory with respect to the electron - ion interaction strength .",
    "thus , it offers rates that take into account either strong collisions or energy transfer via collective modes .",
    "however , statistical theory can easily account for quantum effects like diffraction and exchange during the scattering process as well as fermi statistics in degenerate systems .    here , we conduct an extensive comparison of available md data with results from quantum statistical theory .",
    "first we investigate the electron - ion energy transfer for parameters where strong binary collisions are important . in this connection",
    ", we analyze parametrizations of the energy transfer rates in terms of a modified coulomb logarithm that is chosen to match results of a full binary collision theory ( t - matrix approach ) @xcite or data from md simulations",
    ". then we evaluate the quality of different approximations often applied when computing of the energy transfer within the fgr approach and , identify parameter regions where these approximations are applicable .",
    "the limits of applicability are particularly important when searching for cm effects by comparing to energy transfer rates based on fgr .",
    "finally , we compare energy transfer rates based on binary collision theory , fermi s golden rule and the cm approach to results from md simulations .",
    "we find only small hints of cm effects in few of the md data .",
    "the further analysis shows that this finding is related to the small temperature difference considered in most simulations .",
    "moreover , some of the published md simulations were performed for parameters outside the truly classical regime which may contribute to the inconsistencies found .",
    "the electron - ion energy transfer via binary collisions is traditionally described in form of the landau - spitzer ( ls ) approach @xcite valid for weakly coupled , classical plasmas .",

    "most md simulations performed so far do not meet all requirements to clearly observe cm mode effects as they often consider systems with @xmath73 . comparing the md data with both results from a full cm theory and the fgr approach ,",
    "one finds strong indications of cm effects in the few md data for @xmath74 .",
    "however , these simulations are too close , or even beyond , the lines @xmath70 or @xmath71 to unambiguously exclude that the reductions in energy transfer observed are related to the application of pseudo - potentials or the break of classical statistics inherent to md simulations .",

    "<S> we evaluate various analytical models for the electron - ion energy transfer and compare the results to data from molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the models tested includes energy transfer via strong binary collisions , landau - spitzer rates with different choices for the cut - off parameters in the coulomb logarithm , rates based on fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) and theories taking coupled collective modes ( cm ) into account . in search of a model easy to apply , we first analyze different approximations of the fgr energy transfer rate . then we investigate several numerical studies using md simulations and try to uncover cm effects in the data obtained . </S>",
    "<S> most md data published so far show no distinct cm effects and , thus , can be interpreted within a fgr or binary collision approach . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this finding is related to the parameter regime , in particular the initial temperature difference , considered in these investigations . </S>"
