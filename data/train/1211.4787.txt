    "if a knot @xmath0 in a 3-manifold @xmath1 is in bridge position with respect to a heegaard surface @xmath2 for @xmath1 , both bridge number @xmath6 and distance @xmath7 are integer measures of the complexity of the bridge position .",
    "both give rise to knot invariants ( since we can minimize over all possible bridge positions for @xmath0 ) and both reflect , to some degree , the topology and geometry of the knot exterior .",
    "although , in general , there is no relationship between bridge number and the genus of essential surfaces in the knot exterior , we show that , for knots with bridge surfaces of distance at least 3 , the bridge number is bounded above by an explicit linear function of the genus of such a surface , assuming the surface has non - empty , non - meridional boundary . as a consequence ,",
    "we show :    [ apps1 ] suppose that @xmath0 is a non - trivial knot in a closed , connected orientable 3-manifold @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a bridge surface for @xmath8 , other than a 2 or 4 punctured sphere , and with @xmath9 .",
    "then the following hold :    1 .   if @xmath0 is null - homologous in @xmath1 then @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the minimum genus of a seifert surface for @xmath0 .",
    "if the exterior of @xmath0 is aspherical and non - trivial dehn surgery on @xmath0 produces a reducible 3-manifold , then @xmath12 .",
    "if the exterior of @xmath0 is atoroidal , and non - trivial dehn surgery on @xmath0 produces a toroidal 3-manifold , then @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , if the surgery slope is non - longitudinal , then @xmath12 .",
    "the first conclusion is surprising , for if we drop the hypothesis that @xmath9 , there are genus 1 knots of arbitrarily high bridge number . for example",
    ", let @xmath14 be a sequence of knots in @xmath15 such that the minimum bridge number of a bridge sphere for @xmath14 goes to infinity with @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath17 is the whitehead double of @xmath14 , the seifert genus of @xmath17 is 1 but the bridge number of @xmath17 is at least twice the bridge number of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we expect that there are genus 1 hyperbolic knots of arbitrarily large bridge number , but constructing them is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the second conclusion puts strong restrictions on any potential counterexample to the cabling conjecture @xcite . for , suppose that a counterexample @xmath18 is in minimal bridge position with respect to a heegaard sphere @xmath2 .",
    "hoffman @xcite showed that @xmath19 and , in @xcite , claims he has also proved ( in unpublished notes ) that @xmath20 .",
    "if that result is correct , then our result reduces the cabling conjecture to studying knots having bridge spheres @xmath2 satisfying the simple combinatorial condition @xmath21 . in a forthcoming paper , we will describe all knots in @xmath15 with a bridge sphere satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "many of them , it turns out , contain an essential meridional planar surface in their exterior , much like when @xmath23 .",
    "thus , resolving the cabling conjecture for knots with an essential tangle decomposition would be an important step towards resolving the cabling conjecture in general . towards that end , hayashi @xcite",
    "has shown that if @xmath0 has an essential tangle decomposition such that no two strands of either tangle are parallel , then @xmath0 satisfies the cabling conjecture and taylor @xcite has shown that if @xmath0 is formed by attaching a `` complicated '' band to a two component link ( e.g. if @xmath0 is a band sum ) then @xmath0 also satisfies the cabling conjecture .",
    "however , the proof of the cabling conjecture for the case when @xmath0 has an essential meridional planar surface in its exterior remains incomplete .    with reference to the last conclusion",
    ", we note that if a knot @xmath18 lies in some complicated way on a knotted genus 2 surface @xmath24 , then a dehn surgery on @xmath0 corresponding to the ( integral ) slope of @xmath25 will likely produce a toroidal 3-manifold . presumably , if the knotting of @xmath26 is complicated enough , then the bridge number of @xmath0 with respect to a heegaard sphere can be made arbitrarily high .",
    "eudave - muoz @xcite has given examples of hyperbolic knots in @xmath15 with toroidal surgeries of half - integral slope .",
