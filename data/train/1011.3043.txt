    "graphene @xcite and its bilayer @xcite have attracted much attention recently due to the novel fundamental physics that they display and huge scope that they have for device applications @xcite . in particular , electrons in monolayer graphene (",
    "whose low - energy quasiparticles mimic chiral dirac fermions with linear dispersion ) have displayed relativistic - like phenomena , including klein tunneling @xcite and the half - integer quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "electrons in bilayer graphene show properties which are hybrid between the monolayer and traditional two - dimensional semiconductor systems , since the low - energy quasiparticles are chiral , but the inter - layer coupling induces an effective mass and corresponding quadratic energy dispersion .",

    ", we give a comprehensive description of the band structure and density of states of irradiated bilayer graphene , both in zero external magnetic field and in a strong field .",
    "this is of fundamental physical importance , but also has application in the realm of devices and technology because of the growing consensus that graphene and its bilayer have vast potential in the fields of optoelectronics and photonics @xcite , and in the design of new electronic devices such as ambipolar transistors @xcite .",
    "also , the spin - like degrees of freedom in graphene ( such as the lattice pseudospin and the valley ) may allow for electronic implementations of the ideas of spintronics @xcite which have been discussed in the literature @xcite . in all of these areas ,",

    "the energy spectrum and wave functions of the static hamiltonian are presented in [ app : sp ] , both in zero external magnetic field and when a strong magnetic field quantizes the electron motion into landau levels .",
    "the solutions of the time - dependent part are found via the floquet theorem , which we describe below .",
    "the time - dependent term in the hamiltonian is not known _ a priori _ , so we describe the process by which it is derived .",
    "the irradiating field is represented as a time - dependent vector potential which is introduced to the static hamiltonian via peierl s substitution @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",

    "the mixing between different fourier harmonics is stronger for the lower frequency , but the dynamic gap opened by the mixing is larger for the higher frequency .",
    "the dynamic gaps only occur when states from opposite bands mix .",
    "states from the same band run parallel to each other ( seperated in energy by @xmath82 ) and therefore can not cross .",

    "[ fig : vpspec ] ]    when a gap is introduced to the spectrum by doping one side of the graphene bilayer or by electrostatic gating , the effect of the radiation is markedly different .",
    "this is because the gap means that consecutive fourier harmonics from opposite bands do not cross , and therefore the spectral weight is spread only between floquet states which originate from the same band .",
    "therefore no anticrossings appear , although the effect of a broadening of the band will be seen .",
    "this is illustrated in panel ( d ) of figure [ fig : bzerospectrum ] .",
    "however , as figure [ fig : vpspec ] shows , the coupling to right - handed circularly polarized light is stronger in the k valley than in the k@xmath86 valley .",
    "this is due to the redistribution of the wave function among the four lattice sites as a result of the interlayer bias potential which generates the gap .",
    "if the direction of the potential or the orientation of the irradiating field are changed , then the coupling becomes stronger in the k@xmath86 valley instead .",
    "if linearly polarized light is used , the response of electrons in the two valleys are identical since linearly polarized radiation can be represented as the sum of two circularly polarized components .",
    "the floquet wave functions which are calculated numerically can now be used in equations and to compute the green s function and hence the density of states .",
    "the green s function is @xmath87 where @xmath88 labels the discrete set of floquet states with wave vector @xmath89 and @xmath19 labels the unirradiated basis states with wave vector @xmath89 .",
    "the density of states can be calculated by substituting this expression into equation and numerically evaluating the integral over momentum : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the momentum cut - off determined by requiring the summation over all states yields the correct electron density at half - filling .",

    ", the interlayer bias potential is zero so that the graphene does not have a static gap .",
    "the density of states for unirradiated graphene is constant in this case , as predicted by straightforward analysis of the band structure .",
    "when the graphene is irradiated , dynamic gaps open at @xmath92 and are clearly visible for stronger fields .",
    "the responses of electrons in the two valleys are identical . in ( b ) , the same system parameters are used , except that now a small static gap is present ( @xmath93 ) . in the unirradiated case ( thin solid line ) , the static gap manifests as a region with near - zero dos for small energies ( @xmath94 ) . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the dynamic gaps are still present . however , for @xmath96 , a finite dos is present under strong radiation .",
    "this is due to the dynamical states that are induced by the radiation . in ( c ) , the gap is wider ( @xmath97 ) and now the conduction and valence bands are seperated to an extent where significant coupling between them is not permitted .",
    "however , states within the same band do still couple causing the band edge to be significantly smeared and for electron density to be present in the static gap .",

    "this is due to the gauge field which breaks the translational symmetry .",

    "the mixing of dynamical states is small and the original landau level spectrum is recognizable . for strong coupling ( @xmath107 ) ,",
    "the landau level spectrum is replaced by a near - continuum of levels , each with rather small weight , and there are the beginings of states visible in the gapped region .",

    "we clearly see the radiation - induced dynamical bands as expected .",
    "the first feature of these plots which requires discussion is the difference between the behavior in the conduction and valence bands for the two circular polarizations .",

    "the factors like @xmath112 mean that the weight on each lattice component are different in the two bands , implying that the field will affect these electrons differently .",
    "when strong coupling occurs , the landau level spectrum is almost washed out by the dynamical bands , but when coupling is weak , the states are still clearly discernable . there is also a slight shift in the energy of the landau levels in each valley , which is caused by the broken valley degeneracy in the single - particle spectrum [ see equation ] .",

    "if a current is incident on a region of irradiated bilayer graphene where the radiation and inter - layer bias are tuned such that states only exist in one valley , then incident current in the valley where there are no states will not be able to traverse the irradiated region .",
    "this region can then act as a filter for the electron valley , leading to the possibility of switching devices and ` valleytronic ' applications @xcite .",
    "we define the polarization to be @xmath120 so that @xmath121 implies that all electrons are in the k valley and @xmath122 means that all are in the k valley .",

    "this is important if highly - polarized electron currents are to be produced .",
    "lastly , in panel c ) we show that the polarization induced near the dynamical gaps becomes more pronounced and exists for a wider energy range when the field strength is increased .",
    "this is in contrast to polarization features caused by additional dynamical states appearing in the static gap , which exist only for small parameter ranges .",
    "the features associated with the dynamical gaps also become stronger as the frequency @xmath16 is increased .    in the case where a strong magnetic field is present ,",
