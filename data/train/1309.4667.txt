    "continuous - time it semimartingales are used widely to model stochastic processes in various areas such as finance .",
    "the general it semimartingale process is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are processes with cdlg paths , @xmath3 is a brownian motion and @xmath4 is a jump process ; formal conditions are given in the next section .",
    "inference for model  ( [ eqxintro ] ) in the general case ( either in a parametric or a nonparametric context ) is quite complicated because of the many `` layers of latency , '' for example , as typical in financial applications , @xmath2 and @xmath4 can have randomness not captured by  @xmath5 .",
    "when @xmath6 is sampled at discrete times but with the mesh of the observation grid shrinking to zero , that is , high - frequency data of @xmath6 are available , the distinct pathwise behavior of the components in ( [ eqxintro ] ) can be used to nonparametrically separate them .",
    "indeed , various techniques have been already proposed to estimate nonparametrically the integrated variance @xmath7 over a specific interval @xmath8 $ ] ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite ) , and more generally integrated variance measures of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a continuous function with polynomial growth [ and there are more smoothness requirements on @xmath10 for determining the rate of convergence ] ; see theorems 3.4.1 and 9.4.1 in  @xcite and the recent work of  @xcite .",
    "this paper extends the existing literature on high - frequency nonparametric volatility estimation by developing a nonparametric jump - robust estimator of the occupation time of the latent volatility process @xmath11 where the volatility occupation time is defined by @xmath12.\\ ] ] evidently , the right - hand side of ( [ eqot ] ) is of the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 , which unlike earlier work is a discontinuous function .    if @xmath15 is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , its derivative @xmath16 , that is , the volatility occupation density , is well - defined . by the lebesgue differentiation theorem , the occupation density can be equivalently defined as @xmath17 in addition to estimating @xmath18 , in this paper we also develop a consistent estimator for the volatility occupation density @xmath19 using the high - frequency record of @xmath6 .    the occupation measure of the volatility process `` summarizes '' in a convenient way the information regarding the volatility behavior over the given time interval . indeed , for any bounded ( or nonnegative )",
    "borel function @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , theorem  6.4 of @xcite ) , we have @xmath20 thus , the occupation time and its density can be considered as the pathwise analogues of the cumulative distribution function and its density .",
    "our interest in occupation times stems from the fact that they are natural measures of risk , particularly in nonstationary settings where invariant distributions do not exist ; see , for example , the discussion in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , there has been a significant interest ( both theoretically and in practice ) in pricing options based on the occupation times of an underlying asset ; see for example , @xcite and  @xcite and references therein . here , we show how to measure nonparametrically occupation times associated with the volatility risk of the price process . as a by - product , we also estimate the corresponding quantiles of the actual path of the volatility process over the fixed time interval .",
    "since the pathwise volatility quantiles are preserved under monotone transformations , they provide a convenient way of studying the variability of the volatility and the relationship of the latter with the volatility process itself.=-1    we summarize our estimation procedure as follows .",
    "we first split the fixed time interval into blocks of decreasing length and form local estimates of the unobserved stochastic variance over each of the blocks .",
    "the volatility estimates over the blocks are truncated variations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) , and we further allow for adaptive choice of the truncation level that makes use of some preliminary estimates of the stochastic variance .",
    "then , our estimator of the volatility occupation time is simply the empirical cumulative distribution function of the local volatility estimates over the blocks .",
    "analogously , we estimate the volatility occupation density from the local volatility estimates using kernel smoothing .",
    "our estimation problem can be compared with the recent work of @xcite .",
    "jacod and rosenbaum  @xcite  show that an estimator of @xmath21 , for @xmath10 a @xmath22 function , formed by plugging in local variance estimates formed over blocks of decreasing length , can achieve the efficient @xmath23 rate of convergence ( for @xmath24 being the length of the high - frequency intervals ) .",
    "similar to  @xcite , our estimator here is formed by plugging local variance estimates in our function of interest .",
    "the main difference between the current work and  @xcite is that in our case the function @xmath10 in ( [ eqotheorem ] ) is discontinuous . as a result , the precision of estimating the volatility occupation time depends on the uniform rate of recovering the volatility process outside of the times of the `` big '' volatility jumps ( with the size of the `` big '' jumps shrinking asymptotically to zero ) .",
    "therefore , in the basic case when @xmath6 and @xmath25 are continuous , the rate of convergence of the volatility occupation time estimator is ( almost ) @xmath26 which , as we show in the paper , is the optimal uniform rate for recovering the volatility trajectory from high - frequency observations . by contrast ,  @xcite derive a central limit theorem for the convergence of their estimator to @xmath21 by making use of the assumed smoothness of @xmath27 and applying second - order taylor expansion of the function @xmath27 evaluated at the local volatility estimator in their bias - correction and asymptotic negligibility arguments .",
    "finally , our inference for the volatility occupation time and its density can be compared with the estimation of occupation time and density of a recurrent markov diffusion process from discrete observations of the process ; see , for example ,  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that here the state vector , and therefore the stochastic volatility , is not fully observed .",
    "hence , we first need to recover nonparametrically the unobserved volatility trajectory , and the error associated with recovering the volatility trajectory determines the asymptotic behavior of our estimators .",
