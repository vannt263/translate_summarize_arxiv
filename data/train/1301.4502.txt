    "threshold resummation  @xcite plays an important role in extending and stabilizing the accuracy of perturbative results , and it may be of some relevance even for hadronic processes which are quite far from threshold  @xcite , due to the fact that the underlying partonic process can be rather closer to threshold than the hadronic one  @xcite .",
    "all - order resummed results are known to lead to a divergent series when expanded out in powers of the strong coupling : this is physically due to the fact that resummation is obtained by choosing as a scale of the parton - level process the maximum energy of the radiated partons  @xcite , which tends to zero in the threshold limit .",
    "the divergence can be tamed by introducing suitable subleading contributions , such as exponentially suppressed terms outside the physical kinematic region  @xcite , or power - suppressed terms  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was suggested , within the context of a scet approach to threshold resummation , that the divergence can be tamed by making a hadronic choice of scale . in scet",
    "this is possible because resummed results are characterized by a `` soft scale '' @xmath0 : the becher - neubert ( bn ) scale choice consists of expressing @xmath0 in terms of kinematic variables of the hadronic scattering process .",
    "the meaning of this choice is not obvious in the conventional qcd approach , where , because of perturbative factorization , the partonic cross section , which is being resummed , is independent of the hadronic kinematic variables .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     in ref .",
    "@xcite we have clarified this issue by explicitly exhibiting a relation between the @xmath0 dependent resummed scet result , and the standard ( @xmath0 independent ) qcd expression .",
    "specializing to the bn scale choice ( while taking the drell - yan process  @xcite as an example ) we were able to show that in the scet result , with the bn scale choice , the divergence is removed through terms which are logarithmically subleading in comparison to the logarithmic accuracy of the scet result of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is by half a logarithmic order lower than that of the standard qcd result .    here",
    "we show that the accuracy of the scet result of ref .",
    "@xcite can actually be increased to the same level as that of the qcd result , and we rederive , within this higher accuracy , our master formula , which thus becomes particularly transparent .",
    "we then use this improved master formula to discuss various problems related to the bn scale choice .",
    "we consider for definiteness inclusive drell - yan production , but the same discussion applies to other processes , such as higgs production in gluon - gluon fusion , with minimal modifications .",
    "the dimensionless invariant mass distribution @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the invariant mass of the pair and @xmath3 the leading order partonic cross section , can be written schematically ( omitting a sum over partons ) in factorized form as [ sigma ] ( , m^2)=_^1@xmath4c(z , m^2 ) , where @xmath5 is the parton luminosity , @xmath6 the hadronic center - of - mass energy squared , and @xmath7 , so that the hadronic threshold limit is @xmath8 .",

    ", we shall always choose the renormalization and factorization scales @xmath12 .",
    "standard qcd resummation follows from a mellin - space renormalization - group argument  @xcite : indeed , at the resummed level , both the convolution eq .   and the gluon radiation phase space factorize , so at the resummed level one may write [ melsigma ] ( n , m^2)=_0 ^ 1d^n-1(,m^2 ) = ( n ) c(n , m^2 ) where the @xmath13-space resummed coefficient function has the form  @xcite [ cqcd ] c_qcd(n , m^2)=|g_0@xmath14 |(m^2 , ) where @xmath15 ^ 2m^2)\\ ) \\bigg].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are power series in @xmath11 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    because resummation is obtained through exponentiation , it might seem natural to also exponentiate the function @xmath21 .",
    "however , unlike @xmath22 , @xmath21 is independent of @xmath13 and only depends on @xmath14 . as a consequence ,",
    "it turns out that simply including an extra term in @xmath21 at each order increases the logarithmic accuracy of the coefficient function by half a logarithmic order .",
    "this is summarized in table  [ tab : count ] , where the logarithmic accuracy obtained by including a given number of terms in @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is summarized .",
    "a given accuracy means that all and only the logarithmically enhanced contributions to the coefficient function listed in the last column are correctly predicted . at leading logarithmic ( ll ) accuracy only the largest power of @xmath25 at each order in @xmath11",
    "is predicted ; adding one order in each of the functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 one then obtains the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , which correctly predicts two powers more , and so on to n@xmath26ll accuracy .",
    "however , if @xmath21 is exponentiated and a power counting is performed at the level of exponents , it may seem more natural to include one less order in @xmath21 .",
    "this results in the n@xmath26ll * accuracy , also shown in table , which is lower by one power of @xmath25 at each order in @xmath11 than the n@xmath26ll accuracy .",

    "the scale @xmath36 is a soft matching scale of the effective theory , and @xmath37 formally does not depend on it , up to subleading terms .",
    "however , the scet result resums powers of @xmath38 , so this choice of scale determines what is being resummed .",
    "again , a given logarithmic accuracy is obtained by including a finite number of terms in the perturbative expansion of the functions which determine the resummed result , namely @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , according to table  [ tab : count ] . in ref .",

    "first , we note that the bn scale choice removes the divergence of the perturbative expansion at the cost of introducing logarithmically suppressed non - universal terms .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the commonly used minimal prescription  @xcite , which also introduces non - universal terms ( with support outside the physically accessible kinematic region ) but are more suppressed than any power , or with the borel prescription  @xcite , which introduces power - suppressed but universal terms .",
    "second , we observe that quite in general we do expect pdfs to contain logarithmically enhanced terms . in this case",
    "the terms introduced by the bn scale choice to tame the perturbative divergence can become leading or even super - leading ( i.e. , more logarithmically enhanced than the leading log ) .",
    "finally , we remark that threshold resummation is often useful in situations where @xmath76 is far from threshold , but nevertheless the partonic subprocess is close to threshold  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath107 , and consequently @xmath66 eq .  (",
    "[ eq : cr2 ] ) is actually leading log .",
    "the phenomenological implications of our results remain to be investigated .",
    "they are potentially of considerable interest , given the increasingly important role that threshold resummation , in its various implementations , is playing for lhc phenomenology .",
