    "entanglement is one important concept in quantum mechanics . in quantum teleportation ,",
    "maximally entangled states are the pivotal resource .",
    "it is also the source of power in quantum computation .",
    "usually , quantum computation starts from an initial quantum state , say , @xmath0 .",
    "quantum gate operations are unitary operations that are constructed using a finite set of basic universal quantum computing gates@xcite . at the end of a computation , a measurement is performed on the register so that the outcome is read out .",
    "many schemes have been proposed , and considerable progress has been made over the last decade .",
    "however , it is still a daunting task to build a practical quantum computer .",
    "though it is difficult to build complicated quantum system and to perform complex computation operations , small quantum systems are already easily available and some basic quantum operations can be performed .",
    "recently there have been proposals to perform complicated quantum computation with small quantum systems such as entangled pairs of qubits and simple measurement .",
    "it has been shown that quantum computation can be performed using single qubit operations , joint two - qubit measurement and together with some simple entangled quantum states such as ghz - states@xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "the initial state of the quantum computer may be a separable state and this spares the need to perform complicated gate operations , however at the expense of using some number of entangled states such as einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs .",
    "alternatively , quantum computation can be performed by starting from a very complicated entangled states , and then proceeding to the end by merely measurements .",
    "the cluster state quantum computation scheme@xcite is typical example of these schemes .",
    "valence bond state , proposed by ian affleck @xmath1@xcite and used in condensed matter physics@xcite , has also been found to play an important role in quantum computation recently@xcite .",
    "verstraete and cirac@xcite proved that the cluster state quantum computation and valance - bond - state computation are equivalent .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was shown that universal quantum computation can be carried out by using only pairs of qubits in singlet state and by performing joint two - qubit and three - qubit measurement .",
    "it has the advantage of being deterministic and using a simple initial product state .",
    "single - qubit operation can be implemented by performing a bell - basis - like measurement on the target qubit and another qubit from a singlet .",
    "controlled - z gate is implemented by performing two ghz - like state measurements on the two qubits and three singlets system .",
    "these two unitary gate operations are the basic building blocks for more complicated gate operations .",
    "as this scheme is practically appealing , it is interesting to construct the elementary gate operations in this scheme . in this paper",
    ", we will provide the constructions of the elementary gate operations for this scheme .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we briefly summarize the construction of basic gates of ref.@xcite . in section [ s3 ] , we give the results for the well - known elementary gates mentioned in@xcite , which are the basic ingredients for quantum algorithms in quantum computation . in section [ s4 ] , we give a brief summary .",
    "here we briefly review the basic gate operation in the scheme in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "basic single - qubit local unitary operation on a particle can be implemented in a teleportation fashion .",
    "suppose the state of particle @xmath2 is @xmath3 , and particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are in an entangled state @xmath6 . by performing a joint measurement on qubits a and b in the following - basis @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the pauli matrices @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 is a maximally entangled state , and @xmath11 .",
    "the state of particle @xmath5 becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the outcome of the measurement in basis @xmath14 .",
    "particle @xmath5 then works as the role of particle in the following process of the quantum computation .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the entangled state @xmath6 can be replaced by arbitrary maximally entangled states such as the bell - basis states , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "however this substitution can not be used for the controlled - z gate .",
    "the controlled - z gate , @xmath17 proposed in ref.@xcite involves two ghz - like state joint measurements as redrawn in fig.[f2a ] where we have given explicit labelling to the eight qubits involved .    by doing three - qubit joint measurement of particles on @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 in the following basis , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , the controlled - z gate is implemented between qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the singlet states of the entangled pairs between @xmath19 and @xmath22 , @xmath26 and @xmath20 , @xmath27 and @xmath23 are all @xmath28 .    by replacing the singlet state @xmath6 by other entangled states ,",
    "it is also possible to construct the gate .",
    "the detailed combination of the states used for each pair and the appropriate basis for the joint measurement are given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the main conclusion of this table is that the measuring - basis is determined by the state of the @xmath29 pair , the states of @xmath30 and @xmath31 pairs are irrelevant .",
    "for example , as in fig.[f2b ] , assuming the state of the two original qubits is @xmath32 and the states of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 pairs denoted by @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , are in the bell - basis states , @xmath39 ) were used , half of the information in @xmath40 would be lost .",
    "for instance , if @xmath41 , then the wave function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 would become @xmath42 , which have lost state information in this process due to the form of entangled state of @xmath19 and @xmath22 . to see this more clearly , we write the state of the eight - qubit system of fig.[f2b ] as @xmath43 , @xmath44 where latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }         the entangled state between @xmath19 and @xmath22 is the @xmath6 state , then the three - qubit measurement projections @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are all none - zero .",
    "however if we change the entangled state of @xmath19 and @xmath22 to state @xmath50 , and turn @xmath51,@xmath52 into @xmath53      toffoli gate is the further development of c - not gate .",
    "we present the details for implementing the toffoli gate by doing joint measurement as shown in fig.[f8 ] .",
    "explicitly , the entangled state of @xmath55 is @xmath56 and the entangled state of @xmath57 , @xmath58 are all @xmath59 the entangled state of @xmath60 is @xmath61 the joint measurement basis sets are @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we note that the extra particles @xmath64 and @xmath65 are necessary in this process .",
    "some extra operations should be applied to the wave function of particles @xmath66 after joint measurement too .",
    "for instance , as shown in fig.[f8 ] , if the results of measuring - basis sets are @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then an additional operation @xmath70 on particles @xmath66 is necessary .",
    "fredkin gate is the development of swap gate in a three - qubit system .",
    "the details of the implementation of this quantum gate is given in fig.[f9 ] . here",
    "the entangled state of @xmath71 is @xmath72    the entangled state of @xmath73 is @xmath74    the entangled state of @xmath60 is @xmath75    the entangled state of @xmath76 : @xmath77    the measuring - basis sets are @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "it is worth poiting the extra particles @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath65 are crucial to implement the fredkin gate .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed explicitly the elementary gates for the measurement - based quantum computation , including the generalized controlled - z gate , the phase gate and @xmath84 gate , the swap gate , the c - not gate , the fredkin gate and toffoli gate .",
    "we have studied the relation between the form of the measuring - basis and the entangled states of the pairs .",
    "it is found that the they have an exquisite relation among them . in some cases ,",
    "some parts in the joint measurement basis are necessarily distinct for different qubits in a group so that they can implement the desired quantum gate .",
    "it is interesting to mention that as shown in ref.@xcite , the teleportation - based quantum computation and the vbs quantum computation scheme are equivalent .",
    "it is also equivalent to the cluster - state quantum computation .",
    "in addition , we note that the patterns of entangled states in the process of constructing c - not gate and swap gate are the same and they only differ at the ways of the joint measurement . for these matters , the topological construction of quantum computation@xcite is worthwhile for further study at this point . in all these schemes , entanglement is the core of quantum computation . in the cluster - state quantum computation scheme ,",
    "the entanglement is condensed into the initial state , while in the teleportation - based quantum computation as studied in this paper , the entanglement in injected into the quantum computing system by using entangled pairs of particles .",
