    "there are four types of interactions in nature : gravitational , weak , electromagnetic and strong . in the study of elementary particles at high energy ,",
    "the gravitational interaction plays no known role .",
    "the other three interactions all proceed through the exchange of gauge particles .",
    "the gauge particle for the electromagnetic interaction is the best - known one : the photon , as first pointed out in one of the famous 1905 papers of einstein@xcite .",
    "while the photon does not interact with itself , all the other gauge particles have self - interactions , i.e.  they are all yang  mills particles@xcite .    the gauge particle for strong interactions  the gluon  is the second gauge particle , and the first yang ",
    "mills particle , to be observed experimentally anddirectly@xcite .",
    "four years later , the gauge particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 for weak interactions were observed at cern@xcite .",
    "some properties of these gauge particles are listed in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "all gauge particles have spin  1 .",
    "atoms and molecules are composed of protons , neutrons and electrons ; protons and neutrons are made of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 quarks of gell - mann@xcite and zweig@xcite.the @xmath2 , the @xmath3 , and the electron are all members of the first generation of quarks and leptons .",
    "there are three known generations of quarks and leptons ; some of their properties are listed in table  [ tab : quarks ] .",
    "thus there are six quarks and six leptons together with their antiparticles .",
    "all these quarks and leptons have spin @xmath4 .",
    "the masses of the neutrinos are much smaller than that of the electron , which is the lightest lepton besides the neutrinos .",
    "experimentally , it is known that at least two of the three neutrinos ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) have nonzero mass ; it is generally accepted that all three neutrinos have nonzero masses .",
    "the interactions of these quarks and leptons are described by the standard model of glashow , weinberg and salam@xcite , which is a gauge theory with the group @xmath8 , where the gauge particles are those listed in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "it is an important feature of the standard model that the left - handed and the right - handed components of the quarks and leptons interact differently , according to the @xmath9 and the @xmath10 parts of the gauge group , respectively .",
    "this has far - reaching consequences .",
    "if a quark or a lepton has nonzero mass ( which is indeed the case as seen from table  [ tab : quarks ] ) , then the right - handed and the left - handed components can be transformed into each other through a lorentz transform .",
    "this important point can be seen more explicitly as follows .",
    "expressed in term of the left - handed and the right - handed components , the mass term of an electron , for example , is @xmath11 & = & m_{e}\\bar{\\psi}_{el}\\psi_{er}+m_{e}\\bar{\\psi}_{er}\\psi_{el}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , in order to get a mass term for the electron , it is necessary to couple the left - handed and the right - handed components .",
    "but such a coupling is not allowed because these left - handed and right - handed components transform differently under a gauge transform .",
    "the question is therefore : how can the quarks and the leptons acquire their masses ?    the higgs particle comes to rescue .",
    "the basic idea proposed in 1964 is to introduce a new particle or field that has a nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "some of the early papers on this idea are listed as ref .  .",
    "in the context of the standard model , this new particle is commonly called the higgs particle .    for many years",
    ", this higgs particle had remained the only particle in the standard model not observed experimentally .",
    "it was finally discovered in the summer of 2012 by the atlas collaboration@xcite and the cms collaboration@xcite at cern using the proton ",
    "proton accelerator called the large hadron collider .",
    "it is the purpose of this review to give a brief history of the search and the discovery of this higgs particle .",
    "what are the basic properties of this particle ?",
    "the most fundamental one is that the higgs particle , since it has a nonzero vacuum expectation value , must have spin zero .",
    "= 12.9pt    as already noted above , all the quarks and the leptons are spin-@xmath4 particles , while all the gauge particles have spin one .",
    "therefore , this newly discovered higgs particle not only completes the list of particles in the standard model , but is also the first elementary particle of spin zero .",
    "if one takes the view that this new class of spin-0 elementary particles consists not just of this higgs particle , then it is possible that this experimental discovery of the higgs particle may lead to an entirely new era of high - energy physics .",
    "in particle physics , there is very little understanding of the masses of the various elementary particles .",
    "for example , even though the masses of the electron and the muon have both been measured to the accuracy of eight digits , there is no understanding why the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron . as another example",
    ", the mass of the top quark was not known even roughly until it was observed in fermilab@xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that there was no guess on the mass of the higgs particle even many years after it was proposed theoretically.@xcite    for this reason , the experimental search for this higgs particle must cover a very large range of mass .      limited by the accelerators available at that time , the early searches , i.e.  the searches carried out in the 80s , are for the case of relatively low masses . the first excitement came from the crystal ball collaboration using the doris electron ",
    "positron collider at desy .",
    "they studied the decay @xmath12 and found a peak in the @xmath13 spectrum , corresponding to a higgs mass of 8.32  gev/@xmath14.@xcite this peak , reported at the 1984 international conference of high - energy physics in leipzig and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , has a high statistical significance of above @xmath15 .",
    "unfortunately , this exciting result was not confirmed by the cesr at cornell university .",
    "in fact , with more data , the crystal ball peak@xcite also disappeared .",
    "none of the other searches in the 80s produced a signal for the higgs particle . here",
    "are three examples of such searches .",
    "( a )  the cusb collaboration at cesr of cornell university continued to look for higgs particle in the upsilon decay @xmath16 , the same channel used by the crystal ball collaboration , but did not find a signal.@xcite    ( b )  the sindrum collaboration at the paul scherrer institute proton cyclotron looked for very low - mass higgs particle through the decay @xmath17 with @xmath18 , but did not find a signal.@xcite    ( c )  the cleo collaboration at cesr of cornell university searched for the higgs particle in @xmath19 decay : @xmath20 with @xmath21 but again did not find any signal.@xcite    the conclusion from such searches is that the higgs mass was likely to be larger than 8  gev/@xmath14 or 9  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "lep is the arge lectron ositron collider built at cern .",
    "it was housed in an underground tunnel across the switzerland  france border ; the tunnel has a circumference of 27  km , or 17  miles .    shortly after taking a leading role in the discovery of the gluon at desy , i decided to join the aleph collaboration at lep .",
    "my wisconsin group was the first us group invited to join the aleph experiment .",
    "the main reason for this move to cern was my desire to concentrate on discovering experimentally the higgs particle , but i did not realize at that time this quest was going to take 32  years , from 1980 to 2012 !    the lep design energy for each beam was 100  gev , meaning that the center - of - mass energy was originally designed to reach 200  gev .",
    "there were four detectors at lep : aleph , delphi , l3 and opal .",
    "the operation of lep can be described in terms of two periods , designated as lep1 and lep2 . the strategies to search for the higgs particle are quite different , and are to be described in secs .",
    "[ sec : lep1 ] and [ sec : lep2 ] , respectively below .      during this period ,",
    "lep operated at the @xmath1 peak , i.e.  the center - of - mass energy was 91.18  gev  see table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "thus the event rate was very high .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath1 mass is much larger than those of the particles used to search for the higgs particle as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : earlysearch ] , lep1 provided a significantly larger range for the higgs mass .    at this @xmath1 peak ,",
    "the most useful decay channels for the search of the higgs particle are through @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 means as usual either the electron or the muon , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lep1 ] . in the first channel @xmath25 ,",
    "the observation of the two charged leptons in the decay product gives very clean events .",
    "the second channel @xmath26 , on the other hand , has the important advantage of a larger branching ratio .",
    "plans to search for the higgs particle at lep1 were under way in the early 80s .",
    "for example , in the 1983 meeting of the lep committee , the following question  question  6  was raised :    `` what strategy with respect to data acquisition and analysis would you follow to search for higgs in @xmath1 decay ?",
    "suppose one needs @xmath27 @xmath1 decays to observe ten  events of the type @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . ''",
    "this question was answered by my wisconsin group on december  21 , 1983@xcite :    `` starting with @xmath27 @xmath31 events and by matching the tpc hits in the pad rows to the electromagnetic showers etc . , we can reduce the @xmath27 @xmath31 events to @xmath32 events with 80% efficiency for the higgs events at higgs mass of 50  gev/@xmath33 full reconstruction of these @xmath32 events for physics is expected to be 2030  sec cpu of ibm 370/168 per event . ''",
    "reference   gives a partial list of the publications for the search for the higgs particle on the basis of the data from lep1 .",
    "due to the difficulties of combining the searches from four experiments , very roughly the data from lep1 excludes the mass of the higgs particle to be below 65  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "for lep2 , the center - of - mass energy went beyond the @xmath1 peak , much beyond .",
    "because of this increase in energy , the search at lep2 differs from that at lep1 in that the @xmath1 is real instead of virtual .",
    "more precisely , the search at lep2 can be represented schematically as that of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . of these channels ,",
    "the last one , called the four - jet channel , is the most sensitive one .    in the ecfa workshop of 1986",
    ", i presented the simulated results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the center - of - mass energy of lep was taken to be 200  gev with the higgs mass of 40  gev/@xmath14 and 60  gev/@xmath14.@xcite    = 12.9pt    until the year 1999 , with lep running at a center - of - mass energy up to 200  gev , no indication was found of the production of the higgs particle .",
    "the 95% confidence limit for the lower bound of the higgs mass was 107.9  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "this lower bound is essentially the difference of the lep energy and the @xmath1 mass : @xmath34 .",
    "then things became more interesting .",
    "gigantic efforts were made to push the lep energy beyond the original design energy . with new ideas of working with lep , six machine upgrades were implemented . in this way",
    ", the center - of - mass energy reached a phenomenal value of 209  gev , making lep sensitive in principle to a higgs mass of @xmath35 .",
    "promising candidates started to show up ! in late june 2000 , aleph found the first higgs candidate with a reconstructed mass of 114  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "this event was found by both cut - based and neural network analyses .",
    "the ten most significant higgs candidates from the four experiments at lep are listed in table  [ tab : candidates].@xcite    because of these events , the lep higgs working group made , on november  3 , 2000 , a request to the lep committee for a 46 months extension in 2001 .",
    "this request was denied and lep was shut down in the first week of november 2000 , after delivering 11  years of great physics .",
    "this is very disappointing for those of us who believed that we were really close to a major discovery .",
    "but , in retrospect , no complaints .",
    "the tevatron collider was a proton  antiproton colliding accelerator that had been operating at fermilab since 1987 .",
    "its maximum beam energy was 0.98  tev , and thus its maximum center - of - mass energy was 1.96  tev .",
    "the radius of the tunnel for this collider was 1  km .",
    "the advantage of this tevatron collider was that it was a proton ",
    "antiproton collider .",
    "being a proton ",
    "antiproton collider , both the protons and the antiprotons were accelerated and stored in the same beam pipe .",
    "thus the tevatron collider was the first colliding accelerator in the tev regime . since it was a proton  antiproton colliding - beam accelerator , its luminosity is typically lower by a factor of ten compared with that of a proton ",
    "proton collider .",
    "there were two detectors at this tevatron collider : cdf and d0 .",
    "after lep was shut down near the end of the year 2000 as described in the preceding section , for ten  years the tevatron collider was the only place to search for the higgs particle .",
    "see sec .",
    "[ sec : largehadron ] below .",
    "unfortunately , during these ten  years , this tevatron collider did not manage to discover the higgs particle ; the main reason for this was that it did not produce sufficient amount of integrated luminosity .",
    "it has been estimated that , for the discovery of the higgs particle , the necessary integrated luminosity is about two and half times of what it actually produced .",
    "still , the tevatron experiments produced several results from their higgs searches ; the following is selected from their combined cdf+d0 results :    in july 2011 , with up to 8.6  fb@xmath36 , the combined tevatron analysis was able to exclude ( at the 95%  cl ) standard model higgs boson masses between 156  gev/@xmath14 and 177  gev/@xmath14 .",
    "the result was presented in eps - hep 2011 .    in ichep 2012",
    ", the tevatron experiments gave the result of the higgs search combination with their full dataset ( up to 10  fb@xmath36 ) .",
    "they set a 95%  cl exclusion for higgs boson masses between 100  gev/@xmath14 and 103  gev/@xmath14 , and between 147  gev/@xmath14 and 180  gev/@xmath14.@xcite more interestingly , they observed a @xmath37 excess between 115  gev/@xmath14 and 140  gev/@xmath14.@xcite the excess was concentrated in the @xmath38channel ( fig .",
    "[ fig4_1]).@xcite    the tevatron collider was shut down in 2011 after 24  years of operation .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a proton  proton collider built in the lep tunnel .",
    "its design energy is 14  tev in the center - of - mass system ; when it began to produce experimental data in 2010 , it was running at half of this design energy . in 2012 ,",
    "this center - of - mass energy was raised to 8  tev .",
    "this lhc is a remarkable accelerator : since the previous highest energy of 1.96  tev was from the tevatron collider of fermilab , the initial energy of the lhc was an increase of more than 3.5 times .",
    "such an increase is phenomenal , and thus there is expectation of a great deal of new physics from lhc .",
    "there are four major experiments at lhc : two large ones  atlas and cms   together with two smaller ones  alice and lhcb .",
    "the higgs search and discovery have been carried out entirely by the two large experiments atlas and cms .    in both of these two experiments ,",
    "the mass range of the higgs particle covered is from 600  gev/@xmath14 down to about 110  gev/@xmath14 , which is the lower limit of the higgs mass from lep .",
    "upper higgs mass limit of about 158  gev/@xmath39 has been known from electroweak fits , but such limit is not taken into account in these searches for two reasons :    such a limit is obtained on the assumption that there is only one higgs particle , but there is no good basis for such an assumption ; and    with the abundance of data from lhc , there is no reason not to carry out the search for the range quoted above .      at the lhc ,",
    "protons first went around the full ring on september  10 , 2008 .",
    "unfortunately , nine days later on september 19 , an electric fault triggered a major setback .",
    "the cause of this setback was due to a faulty electric connection between two of the accelerator magnets ; this resulted in mechanical damage and the release of a large amount of liquid helium .",
    "a harvard graduate student on shift when this happened sent the following e - mail :    `` lhc e - log : fire alarm in point  3 and point  4 .",
    "fire brigade going there together with rp .",
    "massive quench in s34 .",
    "helium released in the tunnel .",
    "this had to happen on my shift , of course .",
    "no beam for at least one week . ''    some of the damages are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "the damage turned out to be much more extensive than the student s estimate . here are two indications of the damage from this accident :    several _ tons _ of liquid helium were released , i.e.  several tons of liquid helium circulating in the lhc became gas and of course escaped ; and    several of the dipole magnets , each weighing 27.5  tons , were moved by more than 10  cm .    instead of `` no beam for at least one week ''",
    ", actually there was no beam for over a year . since this accident , low - energy proton beams did not circulate again until november 2009 .      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : slep ] , higgs physics at lep is relatively simple : an electron and a positron in the colliding beams annihilate each other into a @xmath1 , real or virtual , and the @xmath1 is coupled to a @xmath1 and an @xmath40  see figs .",
    "[ lep1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the corresponding situation at the large hadron collider is more complicated .    in an event at lep , almost all the particles in the final state",
    "are seen in the detector , the major exception being the neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , in almost any event at lhc with particle production , most of the particles in the final state are not seen in the detector . in particular , many of them go down the beam pipes and are not detected . as an example",
    ", the exclusive production process @xmath41 has a tiny detectable cross section .",
    "for this reason , at the large hadron collider , initially only inclusive production cross sections are of interest , at least for the higgs particle .    to a good approximation , a proton consists of two @xmath2 quarks , one @xmath3 quark , and a number of gluons , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "since the coupling of the higgs particle to an elementary particle is proportional to its mass , there is little coupling between the higgs particle and these constituents of the proton .",
    "instead , some heavy particle first needs to be produced in a proton - proton collision at the lhc , and then is used to couple to the higgs .    from table  [ tab : properties ] and table  [ tab : quarks ] , the heaviest known elementary particles are +    @xmath42 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 +    ordered according to their masses .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of the @xmath42 , the top quark .",
    "the top quark can only be produced together with an anti - top quark or an anti - bottom quark . since the top quark has a charge of + 2/3 and is a color triplet ,",
    "such pairs can be produced by    \\(a ) a photon : @xmath43 @xmath42 @xmath44 ;    \\(b ) a @xmath1 : @xmath45 @xmath42 @xmath44 ;    \\(c ) a @xmath0 : @xmath46 @xmath42 @xmath47 ; or    \\(d ) a @xmath48 ( gluon ) : @xmath49 @xmath42 @xmath44 .",
    "+ as discussed in the preceding paragraph , there is no photon , or @xmath1 , or @xmath0 as a constituent of the proton . since , on the other hand , there are plenty of gluons in the proton , ( d ) is by far the most important production process for the top quark , the heaviest known elementary particle .    because of color conservation  the gluon has color but not the higgs particle  the top and anti - top pair produced by a gluon can not annihilate into a higgs particle . in order for this annihilation into a higgs particle to occur , it is necessary for the top or the anti - top quark to interact with a second gluon to change its color content .",
    "it is therefore necessary to involve two gluons , one each from the protons of the two opposing beams , and we are led to the following diagram for higgs production :     + this production process is called `` gluon gluon fusion '' ( also called `` gluon fusion '' ) . as expected from the large mass of the top quark , this gluon gluon fusion is by far the most important higgs production process , and shows the central role played by the gluon@xcite in the discovery of the higgs particle in 2012 .",
    "it is desirable to make this statement more quantitative .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ ver2 ] the various higgs production cross sections from calculation as functions of the higgs mass.@xcite the top curve is for gluon gluon fusion , and next one is for vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ; note that the vertical scale is logarithmic .",
    "the other three curves are for associated production processes to be described in the next section .    in order to show even more clearly the importance of gluon gluon fusion , fig .",
    "[ ver3 ] shows the ratio of the second most important production process vbf to gluon gluon fusion .",
    "it is seen that , for the relatively low masses of the higgs particle , vbf cross section is less than 10% of that of gluon gluon fusion",
    ". it will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : discovery ] that the higgs particle discovered experimentally indeed has a mass in this range .",
    "thus , through gluon gluon fusion , the gluon contributes about ninety percent of higgs production at the large hadron collider . a more dramatic way of saying the same thing is that , if there were no gluon , the higgs particle could not have been discovered for many years !      as discussed in the preceding section , there is essentially only one way , the gluon gluon fusion , to produce the higgs particle through its coupling to the top quark , the other contributions being much smaller .",
    "[ see , however , the comments on associated production below . ]",
    "let us consider here the alternative possibilities through the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 instead of the top quark .",
    "note , from tables  [ tab : properties ] and  [ tab : quarks ] , that the mass of the @xmath1 is slightly more than , while that of the @xmath0 slightly less than , half of the top - quark mass .",
    "neither the @xmath1 nor the @xmath0 has color , meaning that they do not couple to the gluon . thus the production of the higgs particle through @xmath50 is quite different from the case of sec .",
    "[ sec : gluon ] . instead , a major process is the so - called `` vector boson fusion '' ( vbf ) where a quark from one of the incoming protons emits a @xmath1 or a @xmath51 while another quark from the other incoming protons provides a @xmath1 or a @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 pair or the @xmath54 pair then `` fuses '' to produce the higgs particle .",
    "the diagram for vbf is shown in fig .",
    "[ ver4 ] .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ ver2 ] and [ ver3 ] , the total cross section for vbf is significantly smaller than that for gluon gluon fusion , which is the major production process for the higgs particle .",
    "if it is desired to determine experimentally the contribution from vbf , use is made of the presence of the two quarks in the final state : each quark is seen in the detector as a @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the higgs particle from vbf can be seen in the detector as together with no @xmath55 , one @xmath55 , or two @xmath56 .",
    "a higgs particle produced together with one @xmath55 or two @xmath56 is an example of associated production .",
    "three other examples of associated production are shown in fig .",
    "[ ver5 ] . that of fig",
    ".  [ ver5 ] ( a ) shows higgs production in association with a @xmath0 or a @xmath1 ; these processes are very similar to that of lep in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , except that the electron - positron pair is replaced by a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "similarly , that of fig .  [ ver5 ] ( b ) shows higgs production in association with a top - antitop pair .",
    "this is similar to gluon gluon fusion except that top loop is opened up ; since the top quark is heavy ( which is the original reason why it is desirable to use the top to produce the higgs ) the presence of one top quark and one anti - top quark in the final state reduces the production cross section for that of fig .",
    "[ ver5 ] ( b ) .",
    "all these production processes shown in figs .  [ ver4 ] and  [ ver5 ] lead to higgs production cross sections significantly smaller than that of gluon gluon fusion of fig .",
    "[ ver1 ] , the reason having already been given in the preceding section .",
    "we now turn our attention to the decay processes for the higgs particle .      for the higgs search",
    ", there are several important and potentially useful decay modes .",
    "it has turned out that the most important decay mode is @xmath57 .",
    "this decay mode was fundamental in the design of the atlas and cms detectors.@xcite in the standard model , this decay @xmath57 proceeds predominantly through one - loop diagrams in the @xmath0 and the top quark , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . for the @xmath0",
    ", there is an additional diagram with a @xmath58 vertex .",
    "experimentally , this decay process has the advantage of relatively less background since the final state contains only photons .",
    "furthermore , because of the good energy measurement for photons with the atlas and the cms detectors , this decay gives a good mass determination of @xmath59 for the higgs particle .",
    "this is shorthand for the decay sequence @xmath61 followed by@xmath62for both @xmath1 s , where @xmath24 denotes either an electron or a muon .",
    "thus the final state consists of four charged leptons : @xmath63 , @xmath64 or @xmath65 . when the higgs mass is less than twice the @xmath1 mass , one or both of the @xmath1 s may be virtual .",
    "this channel is often referred to as the golden channel , because the final state consists of four charged leptons .",
    "not only the momentum of each of the particles in the final state is easy to measure accurately , but also the background is under control .",
    "however , this golden channel suffers from fairly low event rate .",
    "the two processes @xmath57 and @xmath67 @xmath68 , described in secs .  [ sec : htogg ] and [ sec : htozz ] above , are referred to as decay processes with high mass resolution .",
    "this designation means that every one of the decay products can be measured accurately , and hence the mass of the higgs particle can be well determined event by event .",
    "in contrast , the decay mode to be considered here is : @xmath69 followed by either : + both @xmath0 s decay leptonically , + orone of the @xmath0 s decays leptonically while the other decays hadronically . it has not been possible to analyze the channel where both @xmath0 s decay hadronically , the reason being that the qcd background is too high .",
    "when at least one of the two @xmath0 s decays leptonically as indicated above , there is either one or two neutrinos in the decay product , making it impossible to determine the mass of the higgs particle event by event .",
    "for this reason , this decay mode being considered here is referred to as a decay process with low mass resolution .    for some time",
    ", it was believed that this @xmath70 decay mode gave the best chance of discovering the higgs particle because of its relatively large branching ratio .",
    "accordingly , there was a great deal of data analysis developed for this decay mode .",
    "there are two other decay channels with low mass resolution , namely , @xmath71 and @xmath38 .",
    "both decay modes present difficulties in their data analyses , but the difficulties are quite different .",
    "the @xmath72 has two different types of decay modes : leptonic and hadronic . for the leptonic decay modes , there are two neutrinos in the final state ;",
