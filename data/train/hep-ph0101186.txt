    "the structure and phenomenology of relativistic bound states are of primary interest to particle and nuclear physics .",
    "unfortunately even in the simplest field theory models our understanding of relativistic bound states is limited by a number of complications .",
    "monte carlo simulation on the lattice is the standard tool for determining particle masses .",
    "one can find the low energy spectrum from the decay constants of euclidean correlation functions .",
    "though the procedure is generally successful it becomes more difficult and less reliable if the state of interest has the same quantum numbers as another lower energy state .",
    "complications also arise for non - confining interactions , where states just above the continuum threshold can obscure the signal of the bound state .  both of these problems arise even in seemingly simple systems such as we consider here , namely , two - body and three - body bound states in @xmath1 .",
    "one remaining complication is of a more operational nature , and it concerns the interface between computational methods and phenomenology .  much of the interesting and important physics associated with bound states is contained in subtle details .",
    "a measurement of gross properties such as the binding energy is a necessary first step , but one also hopes to gain more descriptive information like the structure of the wavefunction , its response to various interactions , or point - by - point comparisons with intuitive non - relativistic models .    these issues were part of the motivation for a recently proposed approach to computational quantum problems which combines diagonalization and monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "diagonalization makes it possible to consider systems with sign oscillations and extract detailed information about wavefunctions and excited states , while monte carlo allows one to handle the exponential increase in the number of basis states for large volume systems .",
    "the first half of the method involves finding and diagonalizing the hamiltonian restricted to an optimal subspace .",
    "this subspace is designed to include the most important basis vectors of the lowest energy eigenstates .",
    "once the most important basis vectors are found and their interactions treated exactly , monte carlo is used to sample the contribution of the remaining basis vectors .  in this paper",
    "we demonstrate how the new diagonalization / monte carlo scheme is applied to the study of relativistic bound states .",
    "the essential problem of the lattice monte carlo approach to bound states near the continuum threshold involves finding the inverse laplace transform of two - point correlation functions at energies close to thresholds where the spectral density is large .",
    "this is usually done by a non - linear multi - parameter fit of two - point correlators for several different operators .",
    "while in principle one might reach arbitrary accuracy by adding more parameters to the fit , in practice the presence of even very small stochastic error will destabilize the fit and imposes an upper limit on the accuracy .",
    "the main advantage of our method , therefore , is not in computing speed but in numerical stability .",
    "our method also provides additional information about the wavefunction of the bound state .",
    "these two statements are not unrelated .",
    "our method has greater numerical stability because we are implicitly using the information contained in the wavefunctions to separate states .",
    "it is also worthwhile noting that in two dimensions the diagonalization / monte carlo approach can be applied within the framework of discretized light cone and might prove useful since , aside from zero - mode problems , the exponential growth of the number of basis states for large volume systems has so far provided a limit to discretized light cone .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the @xmath2 hamiltonian in @xmath3 dimensions and its decomposition into momentum modes .",
    "we then review the basic features of quasi - sparse eigenvector diagonalization and stochastic error correction .  in the following two sections we briefly set aside the numerical discussion and derive solutions to the non - relativistic versions of the two - body and three - body bound state problems .",
    "we then compare our numerical results for the relativistic bound states energies and wavefunctions with an assortment of different approximations and results from the literature .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian density for @xmath2 theory in @xmath3 dimensions , @xmath4 where normal ordering is with respect to the mass @xmath5 .",
    "this theory was introduced in @xcite  as a simple model with a  stable bound state .  in @xmath3 dimensions ,",
    "normal ordering is sufficient to renormalize the theory .",
    "we will consider the theory in a periodic box of length @xmath6 .",
    "this allows us to expand in free particle momentum modes and rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of mode creation and annihilation operators @xcite , @xmath7 in ( [ hamilton ] ) we have used @xmath8 we can represent any momentum - space fock state as a string of occupation numbers , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 for the calculations presented here , we set the length of the box to size @xmath11 and restrict our attention to momentum modes such that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds with a momentum cutoff scale of @xmath14 a change in the cutoff @xmath15 will lead to adjustments in @xmath5 and @xmath16 in order to keep the physics independent of @xmath15 .",
    "however , these corrections begin at @xmath17 as can be checked by power counting .",
    "the dependence on @xmath15 has been measured explicitly for the bound state data presented in this paper .",
    "it is considerably smaller than the dominant error , which is due to higher order corrections in the series stochastic error method , see below .",
    "in order to find approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in ( [ hamilton ] ) , we use a method called quasi - sparse eigenvector ( qse ) diagonalization .",
    "qse diagonalization is an iterative algorithm that finds the most important basis vectors of the low energy eigenstates for a quantum hamiltonian .",
    "we follow closely the discussion presented in @xcite .",
    "we start with a complete basis for which the hamiltonian matrix @xmath18 is sparse .  in our case",
    "we use the momentum - space fock basis .",
    "the qse  method involves the following iterated steps :    1 .",
    "select a subset of basis vectors @xmath19 and call the corresponding subspace @xmath20 .",
    "diagonalize @xmath21 restricted to @xmath20 and find one eigenvector @xmath22 .",
    "sort the basis components of @xmath22 according to their magnitude and remove the least important basis vectors .",
    "4 .   replace the discarded basis vectors by new basis vectors .",
    "these are selected at random from a pool of candidate basis vectors which are connected to the old basis vectors through non - vanishing matrix elements of @xmath21 .",
    "redefine @xmath20 as the subspace spanned by the updated set of basis vectors and repeat steps 2 through 5 .",
    "if the subset of basis vectors is sufficiently large , the exact low energy eigenvectors will be stable fixed points of the update process .",
    "this is the single eigenvector version of the algorithm .",
    "the multiple eigenvector version simply involves selecting more than one eigenvector each iteration and retaining the most important basis vectors for each of the eigenvectors .",
    "one of the most attractive features of our method is that we are working directly with the infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "there is no restriction on the maximum occupation for any mode .",
    "this is a clear advantage over standard diagonalization methods such as lanczos .    in this analysis we work in the rest frame of the bound state and",
    "consider fock states with total momentum zero .",
    "due to @xmath23 reflection symmetry we can diagonalize the even and odd @xmath24 sectors separately .",
    "we use the multiple eigenvector algorithm to obtain the four lowest eigenstates in the even sector and in the odd sector .  for each qse iteration , we select @xmath25 new basis vectors and keep @xmath26 basis vectors .",
    "the final qse results are used as the starting point for the stochastic error correction method .",
    "the qse method approximates the low energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian by finding and diagonalizing optimized subspaces @xmath20 .",
    "this process however has an intrinsic error due to the omission of basis states not in @xmath20 .",
    "the goal of stochastic error correction is to sample the contribution of these remaining basis vectors .  in the present investigation we use the so - called series expansion method up to first order .",
    "this has been explained in detail in @xcite and therefore we restrict ourselves to the review of basic formulae .",
    "let @xmath27 be an eigenvalue and @xmath28 be the corresponding eigenvector of @xmath21 restricted to the subspace @xmath20 ( the span of the subset of basis vectors after step 3 of the qse algorithm ) .",
    "the remaining basis vectors in the full space not contained in @xmath20 will be denoted by @xmath29 , and we are interested in sampling the contribution of these vectors .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are close to the corresponding quantities for the full hamiltonian @xmath21 .",
    "if we now expand in powers of @xmath32 we find that the first order correction to @xmath30 is @xmath33 and the first order correction to @xmath31 is @xmath34 the sum over all vectors @xmath29 is too unwieldy to perform exactly .",
    "instead we sample the sum stochastically in the following manner .",
    "let @xmath35 be the probability of selecting @xmath36 on the @xmath37 trial .",
    "then @xmath38 and@xmath39 for any fixed vector @xmath40 .",
    "before presenting the results of our calculations , we first summarize what we expect in the weak - coupling non - relativistic limit .",
    "for the two - body bound state we consider all two - particle fock states with zero momentum , @xmath41 these states satisfy the orthogonality and normalization conditions @xmath42    at lowest order in @xmath16 the @xmath43 interaction is not relevant to the two - body bound state problem .",
    "the effective interaction hamiltonian is therefore @xmath44 in the non - relativistic limit we can approximate @xmath45 as @xmath46 it is convenient to define the position - space basis vectors @xmath47 since we are considering a periodic box , @xmath48 and the position - space vectors satisfy @xmath49   .\\ ] ]    for any function @xmath50 , we can define @xmath51 if @xmath52 is to have unit norm , then we require @xmath53 in our position - space representation of the two - particle subspace , we note that @xmath54 and @xmath55    upon restricting our hilbert space to the zero - momentum two - particle subspace , we can simplify the interaction hamiltonian by the substitution @xmath56 we observe that @xmath57 the full non - relativistic hamiltonian , @xmath58 can now be represented as a schrdinger operator : @xmath59   \\psi(x).\\ ] ] we now consider the eigenvalue equation @xmath60 using the ansatz @xmath61 we find @xmath62 when @xmath63 we have @xmath64 this expression for the binding energy is consistent with the derivation in @xcite .",

    "the analysis for the three - body bound state is slightly more involved .  in the non - relativistic weak - coupling limit",
