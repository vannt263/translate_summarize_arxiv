    "one of the main goals of the experiments with the hades detector @xcite at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis18 at gsi / darmstadt is the search for a direct evidence of in - medium modifications of hadrons via the di - electron ( @xmath2 ) channel .",
    "this goal is supported by various theoretical indications concerning an important sensitivity of vector mesons to partial restoration of chiral symmetry in a dense and hot nuclear medium @xcite . in particular , as shown within lattice qcd @xcite , the chiral quark condensate @xmath3 as order parameter of the chiral symmetry breaking decreases with increasing baryon density and temperature . since @xmath3 is coupled to the vector meson spectral densities one can expect considerable in - medium effects of light vector mesons which manifest themselves , e.g. , as resonance mass shifts and broadening of widths @xcite .    in spite of the efforts spent to predictions @xcite ,",
    "there is no commonly accepted and reliably quantitative estimate of the change of the mentioned parameters or spectral functions in a nuclear medium .",
    "for instance , within the qcd sum rule analysis @xcite the in - medium modification of the vector meson masses in zero - width approximation is dictated by the density and temperature dependence of the quark condensates .",
    "while the two - quark condensate @xmath3 can be estimated by a model independent approach with reasonable accuracy , the so far poorly known four - quark condensates like @xmath4 lead to uncertainties for the prediction of the vector meson mass shift @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", direct measurements of the vector meson masses and widths , as being at reach with the high - resolution hades detector system @xcite , can also shed light on fundamental problems such as the in - medium change of the four - quark condensate .",
    "since the most pronounced vector meson mass shift is expected for large baryon density in the nuclear medium , there is the hope to verify the effect in medium - energy heavy - ion collisions at sis18 energies , where baryon densities up to @xmath5 can be reached according to model calculations @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of heavy - ion collisions such measurements face a number of problems related to the expansion dynamics and the spatial inhomogeneity of the produced dense matter . due to the collective expansion , the baryon density @xmath6 depends on time so that obviously a time average of the mass shift is to be expected , i.e. the mass shift effect is distributed over an interval related to the temporal change of @xmath6 .",
    "also spatial variations of @xmath6 will make the situation more complicated .    to extract the wanted information on the in - medium meson spectral function in heavy - ion collisions one has also to take into account that the di - electron spectrum @xmath7 as a function of the di - electron invariant mass @xmath8 is actually a convolution of the considered spectral function and the probability to create the vector meson with given energy and momentum .",
    "the latter one usually drops down very fast with the energy making the resulting di - electron spectrum very steep .",
    "this can make the identification of the possible mass shift , superimposed to collision broadening and further in - medium broadening , in particular for the @xmath0 meson , rather difficult .",
    "an additional problem arises for the @xmath1 meson because of its comparatively long life time which , however , may change in a dense medium @xcite . to measure an in - medium mass shift of the @xmath1 resonance one should obviously separate lepton pairs produced by decays in the dense medium from such ones which originate from decays after the disintegration of the dense system .",
    "the aim of the present note is to explore the extension of the usual analysis of the invariant mass spectrum @xmath7 to the more informative double - differential spectrum @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the transverse mass of the pair with transverse two - momentum @xmath11 perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "as shown in @xcite within a schematic fireball model , such an extension with suitable kinematical cuts allows to avoid the majority of the above mentioned difficulties in extracting information on the in - medium vector meson spectral function . here",
    "we present results of our calculations of double - differential di - electron spectra in heavy - ion collisions at sis18 energies obtained within a transport model of boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) type .",
    "as elementary processes for the @xmath2 production we employ pion annihilation @xmath12 , direct vector meson decays @xmath13 with @xmath14 , pion - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , and dalitz decays of mesons , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "pions are produced solely in baryonic resonance decays , and these resonances are created either in baryon - baryon collisions via @xmath17 with @xmath18 or in meson - baryon collisions @xmath19 with @xmath20 , while the  direct vector mesons ",
    "emerge in the elementary reactions @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "our treatment of these processes is described in some detail in @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "let us list our perturbative treatment of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 channels .",
    "we use the parameterization @xcite of the total cross section @xmath23 for @xmath12 in vacuum @xmath24 with @xmath25 mev , @xmath26 mev , @xmath27 mev to generate the in - medium spectrum by @xmath28 where the spectral function is @xmath29 with mass dependent width @xmath30 below we employ certain parameterizations of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath33 annihilation , the distribution of in - medium decays of directly produced @xmath0 mesons into @xmath2 follows in local density and pole mass approximation from @xmath34 with the branching ratio of @xmath35 , so that all in - medium effects are related to the modification of the vector - meson spectral function .",
    "we take the default value of @xmath36 as in vacuum , i.e. , assume that the e.m",
    ".  decay width and the total width change in the same manner .",
    "such a choice of the branching ratio allows us to avoid an artificial change of the relative contributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons ( see below for the case of the density dependent @xmath1 mass shift ) . in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath37 is a parameterization of the total cross section .",
    "for @xmath38 we use @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 mb , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , z = 2 . in case of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) collisions the scaling factor @xmath47 ( 0.5 ) is employed .",
    "the @xmath48 reaction is similarly parameterized , but @xmath42 mb , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 . the scaling factors @xmath52 here are 0.375 for @xmath53 $ ] , 0.125 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and 0.25 for @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath2 decay spectrum of @xmath1 mesons follows from @xmath57 where the path through matter with local density @xmath58 is followed .",
    "@xmath59 is the lorentz factor according to the velocity , and @xmath60 denotes the vacuum branching ratio .",
    "the production cross section @xmath61 is given by the above parameterization with @xmath62 mb , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 for the reaction @xmath66 with the same scaling factors as for the @xmath48 recation and corresponding isospin channels .",
    "the reaction @xmath67 follows from @xmath68 mb , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , where the appropriate scaling factors @xmath52 are 0.5 for @xmath72 $ ] , 1 for @xmath73 or @xmath74 , and all others as above .",
    "according to our experience @xcite , the di - electron spectra roughly scale when changing the mass numbers of the colliding nuclei .",
    "we choose , therefore , the scaled cross section @xmath75 with @xmath76 fm .",
    "since we are going to demonstrate the advantage of certain observables for the case of strong medium effects , we focus on central collisions of gold nuclei at a beam energy of 1 agev .",
    "first we use the parameterization @xmath77 , @xmath78 with constant values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this is schematic and aimed at verifying the previous finding @xcite that a strong in - medium broadening of the vector meson widths smears out the @xmath0 meson peak in the invariant mass spectrum , while the double - differential spectrum still allows to identify the @xmath0 peak .",
    "this set should also illustrate the separate effects of mass shifts . while in @xcite a fireball model with thermal and chemical equilibrium was used to calculate the di - electron spectra , here both",
    "these conditions are not longer required . moreover , to contrast the present study with the one in @xcite we switch off any rescattering of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons once created thus not allowing thermalization and chemical equilibration of these species .    in fig .  1 we exhibit the resulting double - differential cross section @xmath81 for the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "let us first consider the invariant mass spectrum arising by the full @xmath84 integration ( see lower panel in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we are interested in the invariant mass region @xmath85 mev , where obviously the pion annihilation channel @xmath12 dominates over dalitz decay and bremsstrahlung contributions .",
    "the @xmath1 peak sticks out , but the chosen broadening is so strong that any peak structure , attributable to the @xmath0 meson by pion annihilation , disappears .",
    "instead , a knee is reminiscent of the @xmath0 .",
    "this is the general expectation that a spectroscopy of the @xmath0 meson becomes impossible due to broadening @xcite .",
    "however , selecting an appropriate @xmath84 window , say 850 mev @xmath86 950 mev , the @xmath0 peak becomes clearly visible , even for the assumed extreme broadening ( see upper panel in fig .  1 ) . due to phase space weighting ,",
    "the @xmath0 peak position appears slightly shifted to smaller mass . at the high-@xmath8 wing the direct @xmath0 contribution and the pion annihilation yield compete .",
    "the @xmath84 window around 900 mev seems most suitable , as it represents a compromise of suppressing unwanted background , not cutting off kinematically the @xmath0 peak , and still allowing for sufficient statistics .",
    "next let us consider the effect of a mass shift , which is strongest for the @xmath0 meson according to many predictions .",
    "2 demonstrates for @xmath82 , @xmath87 mev that the above found features are persistent also in case of quite drastic mass shifts .",
    "the upper panel in fig .",
    "2 illustrates , indeed , that such a strong mass shift of the @xmath0 meson is clearly visible even in case of the strong broadening in the spectrum @xmath88 , while for the chosen parameters the invariant mass spectrum does not exhibit any @xmath0 peak , due to the assumed strong broadening ( see lower panel in fig .  2 ) .",
    "figs .  1 and 2",
    "show that for identifying the @xmath1 meson still the invariant mass spectrum is enough : for in - medium changes covered by the parameterization of set ( i ) there is no obvious advantage by a particular @xmath84 selection .",
    "the important point here is that the @xmath1 meson rides on the pion annihilation background .",
    "note that in figs .  1 and 2",
    "the distributions are according to the spectral function eq .",
    "( [ eq.6 ] ) and the phase space ; in line with the model assumptions ( no density dependence of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , no rescattering ) , there is no need of an explicit propagation of the spectral function .",
    "let us now turn to temporal and spatial variations of the density which cause an additional distribution of the vector meson decay strength . also here",
    ", the usefulness of the double - differential cross section with appropriate kinematical cuts still applies .",
    "we focus on an illustration of the @xmath1 mass shift .",
    "since the @xmath1 in vacuum is a narrow resonance , often it is assumed to survive the dense stages during a heavy - ion collision and to decay after freeze - out with its vacuum parameters .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 in - medium spectroscopy is considered as more useful in reactions of elementary projectiles with a nucleus under special kinematical conditions in which the @xmath1 is roughly at rest and decays inside the static matter .",
    "we would like to analyze here the prospects of the @xmath1 in - medium spectroscopy in heavy - ion collisions .    in focusing on the @xmath1 meson ,",
    "we leave for the moment being the @xmath0 meson parameters unattached ( i.e. , take vacuum parameters ) and choose @xmath91 , @xmath92 with @xmath93 mev and @xmath94 mev entering the spectral function of the @xmath1 which is of the form of eq .  ( 3 ) .",
    "given the still sufficiently narrow width of the in - medium @xmath1 we propagate the peak according to local conditions and distribute it at each time instant with the spectral function eq .",
    "( [ eq.6 ] ) and sum up the decay products , cf .",
    "( [ eq.7 ] ) .",
    "these procedure is acceptable only for sufficiently narrow resonances ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "since the number of @xmath1 mesons is normalized , an increase of the width means a reduction of the peak height . for the selected parameters , the @xmath1 peak for the above in - medium parameters has a contribution from in - medium decays and vacuum decays .",
    "the first one shows clearly the down shift and the smearing due to the density dependence , see lower panel in fig .",
    "the vacuum peak sticks not longer so much above the pion annihilation yield .",
    "the in - medium and vacuum @xmath1 contributions compete with the @xmath0 contribution from @xmath33 annihilation . to increase the relative contribution of in - medium @xmath1 decays , in @xcite it has been proposed to select low-@xmath95 di - electrons which stem from very slow @xmath1 mesons which decay in the medium , in contrast to fast @xmath1 mesons which traverse quickly the medium and decay outside .",
    "this feature is also seen in our simulations for heavy - ion collisions in the upper panel in fig .  3 ,",
    "where we selected di - electrons with @xmath96 mev : the vacuum contribution becomes significantly less , while the in - medium @xmath1 contribution is clearly seen as a shifted bump riding on the @xmath33 annihilation background .",
    "this is in contrast to the invariant mass spectrum which is integrated over all @xmath95 ( see lower panel in fig .",
    "3 ) where the strong competition between the wanted @xmath1 meson signal and the @xmath33 annihilation background makes a conclusion on a in - medium @xmath1 mass shift difficult . therefore , the measurement of the double - differential di - electron spectrum at low values of @xmath95 offers much better chances to verify a @xmath1 meson mass shift .",
    "further cuts , e.g. setting an additional narrow repidity window around mid - rapidity , suppress too strongly the yield but do not enhance efficiently enough the in - medium contribution .    with respect to the latest hades @xmath2 measurement in carbon - carbon collisions , we mention that in our simulations of central collisions c + c the @xmath95 dependence is similar to the case of au + au .",
    "however , for c + c the  in - medium @xmath1 shoulder  appears below the @xmath33 channel , since the in - medium @xmath1 contribution is attenuated due to the shorter life time and the smaller volume of compressed nuclear matter .",
    "the vacuum decay contribution dominates , even for small values of @xmath95 .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the above choice of @xmath97 , which assumes that @xmath98 and @xmath99 scale in the same manner in medium .",
    "in contrast , often an in - medium change of @xmath99 is assumed , and @xmath98 is kept constant ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) . in the latter case",
    "the in - medium contribution is noticeably suppressed , as evidenced in fig .",
    "4 . clearly",
    ", this issue , as the treatment of dynamical in - medium effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on a common footing , needs further investigations .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) the spectrum @xmath100 for 850 mev @xmath86 950 mev as a function of @xmath8 is dominated in the region 400 mev @xmath101 800 mev by the channel @xmath12 with a pronounced @xmath0 bump .",
    "this gives a good chance to measure the in - medium @xmath0 meson spectral function by a double - differential di - electron spectrum in heavy - ion collisions at sis18 energies .",
    "( ii ) by selecting di - electrons with small enough transverse momentum @xmath96 mev one can isolate the in - medium @xmath1 decay contribution which signals the in - medium mass shift and a broadening of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "this @xmath95 dependence may be useful for future @xmath1 spectroscopy .",
    "( iii ) bremsstrahlung and dalitz decays are small in the region @xmath102 400 mev , for the considered beam energies .    our findings , which are not to be understood as quantitative predictions , also show that fairly independently of the specific form of the vector meson spectral function the double - differential di - electron spectrum with suitable cuts allows a better access to the in - medium effects and , therefore , can be an appropriate measurement strategy in hades experiments .",
