    "[ intro ] merging of red - sequence galaxies might be an important channel for the formation of massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) .",
    "such _ dry _ mergers have been observed to take place and have an impact on the population of etgs at both low ( up to @xmath1 ; @xcite ,  @xcite ) , and intermediate redshift , in cluster and field environments  @xcite .",
    "a further evidence comes from the fact that the stellar mass on the red sequence has been found to be nearly doubled from @xmath2  @xcite on , implying that at least some red galaxies must be formed from merging systems that are either very dusty or gas - poor  @xcite .",
    "k - band selected samples also revealed a substantial population of old , passively evolving , massive etgs already in place at @xmath3 , with luminosity and stellar mass functions evolving only weakly up to @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "+ from the theoretical viewpoint , dry mergers are also expected to play a major role . using semi - analytical models",
    ", @xcite found that a large fraction of present - day etgs are indeed formed by merging bulge - dominated systems and that the fraction of spheroidal mergers increases with luminosity , with massive etgs being formed by nearly dissipationless events . as shown by  @xcite , more massive etgs are expected to be built up of several stellar pieces , with the number of effective stellar progenitors increasing up to five for the most massive galaxies . on the other hand , hydro - dynamical simulations have also shown that accretion of smaller disk - dominated galaxies ( in the mass ratio of 1:10 ) could also have an important role in the evolution of massive etgs , explaining the presence of the tidal debris observed at @xmath5  @xcite .    to constrain the role of dry mergers in galaxy formation , it is of importance to perform merging simulations of spheroidal systems , comparing the properties of merger remnants to observations .",
    "so far , merging simulations of etgs have been mostly used to constrain the origin of the empirical correlations among galaxy s observed quantities , such as the faber - jackson  , the kormendy  ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kr ) , and the fundamental plane   relations . the impact of dry merging has been investigated in several works ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "they have all agreed that dissipationless merging is able to move galaxies along the fp .",
    "but it is not clear if dry mergers are also able to preserve other observed correlations  @xcite .",
    "for instance ,  @xcite found that the products of repeated merging of gas - free galaxies are characterized by an unrealistically large effective radius and a mass - independent velocity dispersion , while  @xcite found that only the merging of massive galaxies , that lie on the kr , leads to end - products that still follow that relation .",
    "+ in previous works , merging simulations have been performed by means of etg s models where the stellar component is described by simple analytic density laws , such as the king or the hernquist profiles .",
    "this approach implicitly neglects one key observational feature : the structural non - homology of the etg population  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the observed light profiles of etgs deviate from a pure @xmath6 law , being better described by the sersic ( @xcite ) model  @xcite . the sersic index ( shape parameter ) , @xmath0 , measuring the steepness of the light profile , changes systematically along the galaxy sequence , the more luminous galaxies having higher @xmath0 . moreover",
    ", the shape parameter also correlates with other observed properties of etgs , such as the effective parameters and the central velocity dispersion  @xcite , as expected in view of the correlation of @xmath0 with the luminosity .",
    "different values of @xmath0 correspond to physical systems that differ significantly in their phase - space density structure , with higher sersic indices describing galaxies whose light profile is significantly more concentrated toward the center , with an extended low surface brightness halo .",
    "thus , merging systems with different @xmath0 s might lead to a different evolution of the phase - space density of merging remnants with respect to that of `` homologous '' king / hernquist models . for what concerns dark matter haloes , previous simulations",
    "have usually adopted either the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite or the hernquist ( @xcite ) profile . however , as shown by  @xcite and  @xcite ( hereafter mgm06 ) , galaxy- and cluster - sized halos are actually better described by using either the einasto s model  @xcite or the prugniel & simien model  @xcite rather than a nfw - like profile  @xcite .",
    "the einasto s model is identical in functional form to the sersic model , but is used to describe the deprojected ( rather than the projected ) density profile , while the prugniel & simien model is an analytic approximation to the deprojected sersic profile .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter mnl05 ) and mgm06 found that the deprojected sersic model ( i.e. the prugniel & simien model ) provides a better fit to the projected mass density profile of simulated dark - matter halos , with a sersic index value of @xmath7 for galaxy - sized dark - matter halos .",
    "hence , the deprojected sersic model seems able to describe both the stellar and dark matter components of etgs .",
    "driven by that , we present here new simple models of etgs , where both components follow the deprojected sersic law .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these models as double sersic ( @xmath8 ) models .",
    "the models describe spherical , non - rotating , isotropic systems , and are intended as a tool to perform n - body simulations of etgs . in a companion contribution ( coppola et al .  2009b , in preparation )",
    ", we use the @xmath8 models to investigate how dissipation - less ( major and minor ) mergers affect the structural properties of etgs , such as the shape of their light profile and their stellar population gradients .",
    "the present paper aims at : ( i ) describing the main characteristics of the @xmath8 models , by deriving the corresponding potential - density pair and distribution function ( sec .",
    "2 ) , and discussing their physical _ consistency _ and stability ( sec .  3 ) ; ( ii ) describing how to perform discrete n - body realization of the models , by adopting an optimal gravitational smoothing length for simulation codes ( sec .",

    "we notice that , due to the existence of radial gradients in stellar population properties ( such as age and metallicity ) of etgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath36 ) might not actually reflect the physical properties of early - type systems . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_2_7 ] , considering the observational results on age and metallicity gradients in etgs , the @xmath17 is expected to vary significantly with galaxy radius ( up to @xmath37 ) at optical wavebands ( b - band ) .",

    "considering the lower uncertainty of the mnl05 estimate , we describe the dark matter component of the models with a deprojected sersic model having @xmath45 .",
