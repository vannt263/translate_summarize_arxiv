    "the solar magnetism is caused by a large - scale dynamo operating in the solar interior .",
    "its ultimate goal is to reproduce observed spatiotemporal evolution of the solar magnetic field , such as cyclic polarity reversals and butterfly - shaped migrations , in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "although a growing body of evidence is accumulating to reveal large - scale dynamos in numerical mhd models of sun - like stars , unsolved questions remain to be answered if full mhd description of the solar dynamo mechanism is to be attained @xcite .",
    "there are two approaches to simulate stellar dynamo evolution .",
    "one is global simulations that comprise the entire volume of a convection layer and the other uses local - box calculations of a small patch of the stellar interior . the first simulation of a global dynamo that succeeded in obtaining solar - like cyclic large - scale magnetic fields was performed by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the complicated processes included in global simulations often preclude elucidating the real essence of the large - scale dynamo .    direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the convective dynamo in local cartesian geometry",
    "is complementary to the global model , and is expected to facilitate our knowledge of the nature of convective dynamos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "similar to global simulations , the oscillatory large - scale dynamo can also be seen in the cartesian geometry for rigidly rotating stratified convection @xcite . since mean",
    "velocity shear is absent in this system , only a stochastic process due to turbulent convection would contribute to the large - scale dynamo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a milestone toward a complete understanding of the solar mhd dynamo , the mechanism underlying the large - scale dynamo in the cartesian models must be specified .    in this letter , we quantitatively demonstrate that the @xmath0 mechanism is responsible for the quasi - periodic features of this large - scale dynamo .",
    "first , using a dns model in cartesian geometry , we investigate the characteristic behaviors of the convective dynamo .",
    "next , to disentangle the complicated mhd dynamo processes , we construct a mean - field ( mf ) @xmath0 dynamo model , using the dns results as profiles of the convective turbulent velocity and helicity .",
    "our mf model is tested by assessing the dependence of the dynamo properties on the magnetic diffusivity . through careful comparison between dns results and our mf modeling , the mechanism underlying large - scale dynamo",
    "is revealed .",
    "we use the same model ( model b ) as studied by @xcite ( hereafter ms14a ) as a reference model , in which the large - scale dynamo was successfully operated .",
    "what follows is a brief review of our numerical mhd model .    in ms14a ,",
    "a convective dynamo was solved by cartesian domain ( see figure 1a ) .",
    "this computational domain comprises three layers : a top cooling layer ( depth @xmath3 , ) , a middle convection layer ( depth @xmath4 ) , and a bottom stably stratified layer of depth @xmath5 .",
    "the horizontal size is assumed to be @xmath6 ( in @xmath7 ) @xmath8 ( in @xmath9 ) .",
    "the basic equations are compressible mhd equations in the rotating frame of reference , with a constant angular velocity @xmath10 .",

    "we choose @xmath17 for the convection zone , and @xmath18 for the stable zone .",
    "the density contrast between the top and bottom of the domain is @xmath19 .",
    "the dimensionless quantities are introduced by setting @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the initial density at the top surface .",
    "the units of length , time , velocity , and magnetic field are then given by @xmath4 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the volume average in the convection zone and the horizontal average are denoted by single angular brackets containing the subscripts  v \" and  h \" , respectively . the time - average of each spatial mean is denoted by an additional set of angular brackets .",
    "the mean convective velocity and the equipartition field strength are defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the coriolis number and the convective turnover time",
    "are subsequently given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "all the variables are periodic in the horizontal direction , whereas stress - free boundary conditions are used in the vertical direction for the velocity .",
    "perfect conductor and vertical field conditions are used for the magnetic field at the bottom and top boundaries , respectively .",
    "while a constant energy flux is imposed at the bottom boundary , the internal energy remains fixed at the top boundary .",
    "the fundamental equations are solved by the second - order godunov - type finite - difference scheme that employs an approximate mhd riemann solver @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field evolves with the consistent moc - ct method @xcite .",
    "non - dimensional parameters of @xmath29 ( prandtl number ) , @xmath30 ( magnetic prandtl number ) , and @xmath31 ( rayleigh number ) , constant angular velocity of @xmath32 , and the spatial resolution of ( @xmath33 ) @xmath34 @xmath35 were adopted in the reference model ( see ms14a for definitions of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , & @xmath38 ) .",

    "the large - scale magnetic field with spatiotemporal coherence was a remarkable feature of the convective dynamo achieved in our dns .",
    "this feature is reproducible using a mean - field dynamo model with the velocity and helicity profiles consistently extracted from dns results .",
    "to explore the mechanism underlying the large - scale dynamo in our dnss , we construct a one - dimensional mf dynamo model wherein velocity profiles are adopted from the dns results of the saturated convective turbulence and determine the coefficients required for mf modeling .",

    "in this letter , the mechanism controlling the large - scale dynamo in rotating stratified convection was examined by dns in cartesian geometry and the mf dynamo model with the information of turbulent velocity extracted from dns .",

    "our mf model was validated by evaluating the dependence of the large - scale dynamo on the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "it is concluded that the nonuniformity of the @xmath1-effect is a key ingredient for the large - scale dynamo with oscillatory nature .",
    "the oscillatory @xmath0 dynamo mode is attiring a greater level of attention in solar dynamo modeling .",
    "recently , @xcite reported an intriguing numerical finding in their forced helical turbulence that @xmath0 dynamo can yield solar - like equatorward migration of magnetic activity belts ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the superiority of the @xmath0 mode over @xmath50 mode at the nonlinear stage was found by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a connection between @xmath0 dynamo mode and solar magnetism was suggested in some recent results of global mhd dynamos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the crucial factor is the nonuniformity of the @xmath1-effect .",
    "therefore , accurate numerical modeling of the solar internal @xmath1 profile will offer a way to unveil the mystery of solar magnetism .",
    "there is an arbitrary parameter in the mf model , the thickness of the transition layer @xmath93 in equation ( 10 ) .",
    "the mf solution is actually dependent on this parameter .",
    "if the thickness @xmath93 increases , the cycle period of the mf dynamo becomes shorter and its spatiotemporal pattern deviates from that of dns .",
    "the value @xmath94 adopted here is not based on physical reason but is best suited for reproducing the spatiotemporal pattern of the large - scale dynamo in the dns .",
    "several methods , such as imposed- and test - field methods , have been previously proposed to directly calculate the mf coefficients from dns without the use of a statistical turbulence model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , our model is based on fosa for small - scale turbulence .",
    "not only the quenching functions , but also the applicability of fosa to the anisotropic turbulence remains a matter of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although there is room for improvement in our mf model , it appears to appropriately describe various aspects of the large - scale dynamo in the dns .",
