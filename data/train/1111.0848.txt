    "in 1977 n. sanduleak reported on the discovery of a variable emission - line object in the direction of lmc ( sanduleak 1977 ) .",
    "a comparison of objective - prism plates taken at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory in 1968 , 1974 and 1975 showed strong emission in both the balmer series and [ oiii ] @xmath15007 , 4959 , and suspected variable emission at heii @xmath24686  and [ oiii ] @xmath24363 .",
    "the suspected spectral variability , confirmed in later studies ( morgan et al .",
    "1992 ) , suggested that the source was `` some type of eruptive variable star rather than a planetary nebula '' ( sanduleak 1977 ) .",
    "the object ( since then simply known as sanduleak s star ) was included by allen ( 1980 ) among the symbiotic stars candidates in the lmc , in spite of some conflicting evidence that is still waiting for a suitable explanation , above all , the absence of any late - type stellar signatures in the optical spectra .",
    "iue observations unveiled further peculiar spectral features , suggesting a possible similarity in the far - uv between sanduleak s star , @xmath0 carinae , and sn1987a ( michalitsianos et al . 1989 ) .",
    "earlier work found evidence of ( i ) episodic mass outflow , as indicated by the asymmetry of nitrogen line profiles ; ( ii ) extreme departures from normal cosmic values of nitrogen relative to carbon and oxygen ( i.e. , n / c @xmath3 150 , n / o @xmath3 70 ) ; and ( iii ) an electron temperature @xmath4 difficult to reconcile with pure photoionization models ( kafatos et al .",
    "+ nowadays , the symbiotic nature of sanduleak s star appears , if not well - established , at least less contradictory : among the strongest proofs favouring a symbiotic classification there is the optical emission line spectrum , reminding of a dusty - type symbiotic star ( belczynski et al .",
    "2000 ; munari & zwitter 2002 ) and , even more constraining , the presence of the raman bands at @xmath16825 , 7082 , observed only from _ bona fide _ symbiotic stars .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the discovery of a giant , highly - collimated jet from sanduleak s star in the lmc , obtained by using the magellan telescopes at the las campanas observatory , chile . in sect .",
    "2 we give some technical information about the observations , while in sect .",
    "3 we present the results of our analysis . concluding remarks follow in sect .",
    "as part of a systematic observational campaign aimed at characterizing the symbiotic phenomenon outside the milky way , we have used the las campanas observatory ( lco ) magellan telescopes to obtain medium - resolution images and spectra of a representative sample of symbiotic stars in the magellanic clouds . for one of our survey object , sanduleak s star",
    ", we have discovered a giant highly - collimated outflow , which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the equatorial coordinates and the absolute spatial scale of the image are also indicated .",
    "the discovery image was taken with the _ raymond and beverly sackler magellan instant camera _ ( magic ) at the magellan - clay telescope on 2010 august 26 , and it is the result of the sum of three exposures of 900 sec each , through an interference filter which isolates the @xmath5 6563+[nii]6548,6584  emission lines and the underlying continuum ( effective wavelength @xmath6=6563 ; full - width at half - maximum fwhm=50 ) . to obtain the pure emission line image we subtracted an appropriately scaled version of a 900 sec exposure taken through a narrow band filter which contains only continuum light ( @xmath6=7130 , fwhm=50 ) .    in order to constrain the kinematics in the jet of sanduleak s star ,",
    "spectroscopy has been performed with the _ inamori - magellan areal camera and spectrograph _",
    "( imacs - dressler et al .",
    "2011 ) on magellan - baade telescope .",
    "the spectrograph slit was 0.9 arcsecond wide , and it was aligned along the jet passing through the star at a position angle of pa=71 .",
    "a 1200 sec exposure was recorded on 2010 october 23 with a 300 lines / mm grism blazed at 26.7 , yielding a spectral sampling of 1.3  and a velocity resolution of 160 km / s in the spectral range 6300 - 9300 .",
    "the original spatial sampling is 0.2 arcsecond / pix , but the spectrum was rebinned along the spatial direction ( 0.6 arcsecond / pixel ) to increase the signal to noise per resolution element .",
    "an additional 900 sec exposure was obtained in the same night with the 300 lines / mm grism blazed at 17.5 , covering the wavelength range 4000 - 8000  with similar dispersion and resolution of the redder grism .",
    "the images obtained through the @xmath5+[nii ] narrow - band filter clearly reveal a jet with an overall extent of 58 arcseconds . using a distance modulus @xmath7=18.5 for the lmc ( schaefer 2008 )",
    ", this leads to a projected length of more than 14 pc .",
    "this makes it , to our knowledge , the _ largest bipolar stellar jet _ ever observed , as well as the _",
    "first resolved bipolar stellar jet beyond the galaxy_. adopting an upper limit of 2.4 arcseconds for the width of the jet , this corresponds to a lower limit of 24 for the aspect ratio of the highly - collimated structure .",
    "the _ s - shaped _ morphology of the entire complex hints that the jet is precessing ( fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) .",
    "this behaviour is known to occur across a wide class of stellar sources ( karovska et al .",
    "2010 , terquem et al .",
    "furthermore , the opposite curvature displayed by the sw lobe at its extremes leads us to speculate that the precessional period is comparable to - or shorter than - the travel time taken for the gas to flow over the 7 pc of the sw lobe .",
    "focusing on the small - scale structures , the jet complex is made up of a fairly regular and exceptionally symmetric pattern of knots and apparent bow - shocks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the nomenclature of the structures described hereafter ) .",
    "the most notable features are the opposite and highly symmetric pairs of `` spear - like '' knots marking the very edge of the flow ( named as a and c in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , which appear as its brightest regions in the @xmath5+[nii ] image .",
    "both located at 29 arcseconds from the central source , they display a distinguished _ v - shaped _ configuration and have the remarkable size of 2 pc ( knot a ) and 1.5 pc ( knot c ) , respectively .",
    "two broad arcs of emission perpendicular to the flow axis are clearly visible in the proximity of the ne knots ( a and a ) , extending for almost 5 pc .",
    "they bear a close similarity with the feature n3-n6 visible in the hst images of the classic symbiotic star r aqr ( paresce & hack 1994 ) , even if in the latter case these structures measure only a few tens of au . the sw lobe is characterized by a series of smaller , less collimated knots that seem to have cleared ( c and c ) or are still clearing ( b , b and b  ) their way through an elongated nebula which , very close to the energy source and with a projected diameter of almost 3 pc , displays the characteristic of clumpy turbulence due to hydrodynamical ( e.g. , rayleigh - taylor ) instabilities at the working surface . the morphological similarities with respect to analogous structures found in other classic symbiotic systems on vastly smaller scales ( e.g. , he2 - 104  contini & formiggini 2001 ) is remarkable .    observed integrated fluxes of the brightest knots are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 for the knots a , a , c , and c , respectively .",
    "their corresponding @xmath5+[nii ] luminosities are thus of a few 10@xmath12 , still several order of magnitude larger than knot luminosities in typical herbig - haro objects ( raga & noriega - crespo 1998 ) and planetary nebulae ( gonalves et al .",
    "the optical luminosity of the complex ( assuming that @xmath5+[nii ] dominate its emission and without taking into account the contribution of the central source ) amounts to @xmath13 .      the imacs spectrum mentioned in sect .",
    "2 is finally presented in fig .",
    "+ it shows [ nii ] tracing the global jet kinematics ( with the ne lobe receding from , and the sw lobe moving toward us ) which is characterized by a distinctive profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) in which the flow radial velocity @xmath14 increases linearly with the distance @xmath15 from the origin ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "this behaviour is fairly common in proto - planetary nebulae ( corradi 2004 , huggins 2007 ) and eruptive stars ( weis et al .",
    "it is believed to indicate that the outflow is dictated by self - similar expansion , confirming the ballistic character of the knot trajectory and the explosive dynamics of its ejection ( dennis et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the high degree of symmetry in the point - velocity distribution of the knots strongly suggests that the gas has been ejected in opposing directions at the same speed , giving weight to the hypothesis of recurrent outbursts from the central source at the origin of sanduleak s star jet .",
    "nova - like outbursts have already been invoked for explaining the appearance of supersonic knots and complex bipolar distributions in other sources ( oconnor et al .",
    "2000 , livio & soker 2001 ) .    in this ejection scenario , a few characteristic time scales can be derived . because of its very large size ( @xmath17 pc ) and moderate radial velocity ( @xmath18km / s ) , the flow motion is likely to be almost orthogonal to our line of sight .",
    "if we assume a moderate inclination of the jet with respect to the plane of the sky ( @xmath19 ) , the deprojected velocity would then amount to @xmath20 km / s , value that is consistent with the observations that typical velocity of jets in symbiotic stars is of the order of a few thousands km / s ( leedjrv 2004 ) .",
    "this result gives therefore weight to the hypothesis of a low - inclination system . with this in mind",
    ", we can now obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate of the jet kinematical age @xmath21 by assuming as representative quantities _",
    "i ) _ the largest observed radial velocity @xmath22 , and _",
    "ii ) _ the jet size @xmath23 : then , @xmath24 . for small angles ( @xmath25 ) and for @xmath26 km",
    "/ s ( as from fig.[fig4 ] ) , the derived kinematical age amounts to @xmath27 years , which in turn provides an upper limit for the above mentioned precessional period ( see sect . [ imaging ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) .",
    "if one thus adopts the kinematical age of the farthest knots to be @xmath27 years , a timescale for the ejection period of @xmath28 years is then found considering the average spacing between consecutive knots .",
    "this fact , combined with its faint optical magnitude ( @xmath29 ) , explains why there is no historical record of an earlier outburst from sanduleak s star .",
    "the jet seems also embedded in a diffuse ionized nebula : h@xmath30 emission , particularly strong in the inner part of sw lobe but also visible in the ne one , shows a negative relative velocity of a few tens of km / s with respect to the systemic velocity . within the inner 2 pc , both h@xmath30 and [ nii ]",
    "appear kinematically coupled , and display a distinctive wave - like modulation that is suggestive of a precessing emitting source . at larger distances , [ nii ] follows an increasing linear trend with velocity , while h@xmath30 reaches negative velocities of 60 - 100 km / s up to 4.8 pc from the origin .",
    "this emission may be due to some kind of ionized stellar flow ( even if the velocity is too high for considering a slow wind from a hidden giant companion , as in the dusty - type symbiotic star hm sge - muerset el al .",
    "1991 ) , that is shaping an expanding , perhaps axisymmetric nebula , like the one observed in m2 - 9 ( livio & soker 2001 ) .",
    "a further h@xmath30 component , this time clearly associated with [ nii ] , emerges from the ne knots a and a : in this case , it seems reasonable to interpret it as stemming from the post - shock cooling region created by the interaction between the supersonic knots and the preexisting neutral hydrogen , collisionally excited before the atoms are ionized .",
    "the origin of this neutral material may date back to the time when the present outbursting star ( probably a hot , luminous white dwarf of @xmath31 k  muerset et al .",
    "1996 ) was in the agb superwind phase . or it may be the result of ongoing episodes of intense mass - loss from an extincted giant companion , whose suggested mass - loss rate had been estimated at around @xmath32/year ( michalitsianos et al .",
    "1989 ) . + a careful examination of the long - slit spectrum across the jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) reveals that the bulk of the knot emission comes from [ nii ] , unusually strong ( e.g. , [ nii]/h@xmath33 in knot a , [ nii]/h@xmath34 in knot c ) , providing incontrovertible evidence of shock - ionized gas ( sabbadin & dodorico 1976 ) .",
    "no traces of [ oiii ] @xmath14959 , 5007 and [ oi ] @xmath26300 , nor of the [ sii ] @xmath16717 - 6731 doublet are detected from the knots , preventing us from giving any reliable estimate of the physical conditions ( e.g. , electron temperature and density ) in the flow .",
    "nonetheless , the upper limits in the line ratios that one can derive on the basis of these non - detections ( [ oiii]/h@xmath35 ; [ sii]/h@xmath36 ) suggest a fairly extreme chemistry , in which nitrogen is strongly enhanced over oxygen , and where sulphur ( a valuable tracer of low electron density in shocked environments ) seems virtually absent .",
    "this peculiar composition , namely , the observed large nitrogen overabundance , is strikingly similar to what is seen in the ejecta of eruptive high - mass stars , such as the low - velocity remnants of sn1987a ( fransson et al .",
    "1989 ) and the so - called _ s condensation _ of @xmath0 carinae ( gull 2008 ) .",
    "it may result from the ashes of the cno cycle that have been exposed at the star s surface as a consequence of core - envelope mixing episodes during the agb phase of the present wd . in this framework",
    ", we are then observing the nuclear processed material ejected during the recurrent outbursts that have characterized sanduleak star s recent history , a scenario that has been suggested also in the case of young symbiotic novae ( muerset & nussbaumer 1995 ) .",
    "if this idea is correct , higher - quality data should be able to highlight spatial variation in the chemical abundance along the jet .",
    "in addition , the absence of any detectable sulfur emission ( also barely visible in the spectra of @xmath0 carinae outer filaments  smith & morse 2004 ) might be explained by the intrinsically lower sulfur content shown by evolved objects in the lmc with respect to the milky way ( bernard - salas et al . 2008 ) .",
    "much longer exposures will be needed for recording the weak emission arising from these less abundant elements .",
    "the true nature of sanduleak s star remains a mystery , especially so in light of our discovery of the largest stellar jet to date . despite the striking kinematical and chemical similarity with the ejecta of some high - mass eruptive stars",
    ", it seems unlikely that sanduleak s star was as massive as , for example , @xmath0 carinae .",
    "we note that the star s infrared colors are similar to infrared colors of planetary nebulae and other dusty symbiotic objects in the lmc ( miszalski et al .",
    "moreover , its monotonically fading long - term optical light curve is reminiscent of symbiotic novae that have undergone a recent thermonuclear outburst ( angeloni et al . in preparation ,",
    "muerset et al .",
    "thus we support the idea that sanduleak s star is a ( yet outstanding ) nova - like symbiotic , whose cool component is in all probability a post - agb severely absorbed by an optically thick circumstellar envelope of dust and gas ( di mille et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "this suggestion sounds reasonable when considering that we already know a few galactic symbiotic stars in which the cool component is not visible in the optical because of the tremendous circumstellar extinction ( e.g. h1 - 36 - angeloni et al .",
    "2007 ; hm sge - muerset et al .",
    "1991 , angeloni et al .",
    "2010 ) ; and that the advent of space - based infrared observatories ( such as akari and spitzer ) has unveiled a number of agb and post - agb stars completely invisible in the optical range but extremely bright in the infrared ( bunzel et al . 2009 ; garca - hernndez et al .",
    "+ the size and luminosity of the individual knots in the jet ; their high collimation , maintained at distances beyond 7 pc from the central source despite a not - relativistic flow speed ; the overall size of the jet itself : all this represents observational evidence that challenges our current understanding of astrophysical jets . and",
    "that so far has not been dealt with in theoretical models and numerical simulations simply because nobody would have ever bet that such a giant stellar jet could exist . in this respect , and whatever its origin , we think that the sanduleak bipolar outflow is destinated to turn into a crucial test - bed for future modeling of astrophysical jets .",
