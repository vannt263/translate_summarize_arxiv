    "propagation of vibrational excitations in disordered systems is one of the advanced problems in condensed matter physics . in particular , transport mediated by these excitations",
    "is responsible for the thermal conductivity of amorphous dielectrics ( glasses ) .",
    "however mechanisms of heat transfer in glasses above the plateau region are still poorly understood .    at low temperatures below 1k the low frequency plane long wave",
    "acoustical phonons are well defined excitations which transfer the heat in glasses . at these temperatures",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath6 and is controlled by a resonant scattering of phonons on two - level systems ( tls )  @xcite .",
    "between 4k and 20k the thermal conductivity @xmath7 saturates and displays a well known plateau  @xcite .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite it can be explained by resonant scattering of phonons by quasilocal vibrations ( qlv ) .",
    "the qlv , together with tls and phonons are vibrational excitations responsible for many universal properties of glasses  @xcite .",
    "however , above approximately 20k the thermal conductivity rises again and finally saturates on the level of one order of magnitude higher , at temperatures about several hundreds kelvin  @xcite . as generally believed , the origin of this second rise of the thermal conductivity ( above the plateau ) is not related to phonons .",
    "it was established long ago  @xcite , that in this temperature ( frequency ) range the mean free path of phonons @xmath8 becomes of the order of their wave length @xmath9 ( or even smaller , of the order of interatomic distance ) .",
    "correspondingly , the ioffe - regel criterion for phonons  @xcite becomes violated .",
    "the existence of such crossover was confirmed by molecular dynamics calculations for some real and model glasses  @xcite and disordered lattices  @xcite .    in the regime of such strong scattering",
    "a standard concept of plane waves ( phonons ) with a well defined wave vector @xmath10 becomes inapplicable .",
    "the question then arises : what physical mechanism is responsible for the heat transfer in glasses in this temperature range ?",
    "the numerical simulations show that majority of the vibrational modes in the corresponding frequency range are not localized  @xcite .    as was shown in  @xcite , a lower limit of the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids above 30 k",
    "can be correctly estimated within the framework of the einstein s model  @xcite .",
    "it was assumed that the mechanism of heat transport above the plateau is a random walk of thermal energy between clusters of neighboring atoms vibrating with random phases .",
    "in fact , a diffusion mechanism for the heat transfer in this temperature range was proposed .    at the same time , delocalized vibrations in glasses of a new type , different from phonons , were introduced .",
    "they were called _ diffusons _  @xcite .",
    "these are vibrations spreading through the system not ballistically , as phonons ( on distances of the order of mean free path ) but by means of diffusion .",
    "it is an important class of excitations which occupy in glasses the dominant part of the spectrum  @xcite . in these papers",
    "it was put forward the hypothesis that the boundary between phonons and diffusons is determined by the ioffe - regel criterion for phonons .",
    "since diffusons are delocalized excitations , they may be responsible for the thermal conductivity of glasses above the plateau .",
    "the similar conclusion was made by the authors of  @xcite .",
    "they considered the case of strong scattering of phonons in disordered lattices with a significant fraction of randomly located missing sites , but which is still far from the percolation threshold .",
    "it was shown that , in contrast to the electronic case , the ioffe - regel criterion is inaccurate in the prediction of phonon localization . instead of localization ,",
    "the vibrational transport above the ioffe - regel threshold becomes diffusive with approximately constant energy diffusivity @xmath2 .",
    "the diffusivity was calculated by numerical solution of the newton equations for particle displacements .",
    "similar calculations but for real glasses were done in the papers  @xcite using molecular dynamics methods .",
    "the diffusons above the ioffe - regel crossover were identified also in granular jammed systems with repulsive forces between the particles  @xcite .",
    "they also have diffusivity which is independent of frequency @xmath11 .",
    "it was calculated making use of the kubo - greenwood formula for the thermal conductivity derived in  @xcite . in jammed systems the ioffe - regel crossover frequency @xmath1 can vary .",
    "it is shifted to zero when the system approaches the jamming transition point and rigidity goes to zero .",
    "therefore , as we believe , it is important to study properties of diffusons systematically in systems where they exist .",
    "they bring a new physics to our understanding of vibrational properties in strongly disordered systems and energy / heat transfer in glasses . to study these properties",
    ", we should have a model being sufficiently simple but still allowing to describe all of them .",
    "since we consider harmonic models , the simplest but still rather general , are ( scalar or vector ) models where particles , placed in equilibrium positions , are connected by random elastic springs .",
    "the equilibrium positions can be taken on a lattice  @xcite , or randomly distributed in space  @xcite . with some exceptions",
    ", there is no principal difference between these two cases because equilibrium positions do not enter to the dynamical matrix .",
    "the only important features are the type of disorder in elastic spring constants and the topology of the bonds .",
    "if all spring constants are positive , one can study different situations taking different distributions of random springs to explain existing experimental data  @xcite .",
    "however a problem appears when some spring constants take negative values  @xcite . even if the number of negative springs and their absolute values are relatively small , in the absence of any correlation with positive springs they produce an inevitable mechanical instability in all infinite systems .",
    "therefore , a situation of strong force - constant disorder when appreciable concentration of springs can take negative values comparable with positive ones , is not possible in these models . on the other hand , an inclusion of negative spring constants can considerably improve an agreement between theory and existing experimental data  @xcite .",
    "one can solve this problem mathematically , using a stable random matrix approach  @xcite . in this approach",
    "positive and negative springs are tangly correlated with each other .",
    "these correlations automatically guaranty the mechanical stability of the system independently of character and strength of the force constant disorder . in the present paper we are going to use this approach to investigate diffusion of vibrational excitations in disordered lattices with strong force - constant disorder .",
    "some of our preliminary results have been presented in short form elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ rma ] for the sake of clarity of further consideration , we outline the main properties of the model .",
    "we consider disordered lattices with strong force - constant disorder , described by stable positive definite random dynamical matrix @xmath12 having positive eigenvalues only .",
    "matrix @xmath13 is a random matrix ( not necessary symmetric ) built on simple cubic lattice , with statistically independent matrix elements between the nearest neighbors @xmath14 , having zero mean @xmath15 and equal variance @xmath16 .",
    "we show that the density of states @xmath17 is not zero at @xmath18 and phonons can not propagate through the lattice .",
    "similarly to systems at jamming transition point , the rigidity of the lattice is also zero",
    ". however the physical reason is different . in our case",
    "it is due to high concentration of negative springs ( about 45% ) in the system what makes it extremely soft .",
    "the participation ratio @xmath19 indicates that all modes with exception of high frequency part are delocalized .",
    "as it is shown by further investigation , all of them are diffusons . in section  [ phonons ]",
    "we consider slightly additively deformed dynamical matrix @xmath20 which has phonon - like excitations at small frequencies . here",

    "we show that above @xmath1 , phonons cease to exist .",
    "they are transformed to diffusons . in section  [ diff ]",
    "we consider properties of diffusons .",
    "the number of diffusing physical quantities coincides with the number of integrals of motion . in a closed free mechanical system",
    "there are two integrals of motion , momentum and energy . in section  [ diffmomentum ]",
    "we investigate diffusion of momentum .",
    "we show that for all masses equal , it is equivalent to the diffusion of particle displacements since center of inertia is conserved .",
    "the displacement structure factor @xmath28 coincides well with the structure factor @xmath29 of the random walk on a lattice .",
    "we introduce new additional diffusion coefficient @xmath5 which is _ diffusivity of particle displacements_. it is different from the energy diffusivity @xmath2 investigated in  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the correlation function of particle displacements @xmath30 and radius of diffuson . in section  [ ub55p ]",
    ", we investigate the diffusion of energy @xmath2 using two different approaches .",
    "the first approach is a direct numerical solution of newton s equations . in the second approach",
    "the diffusivity is calculated by means of edwards and thouless formula which relates the energy diffusivity with an infinitesimal change of boundary conditions .",
    "both approaches give similar results .",
    "we show that diffusivity @xmath2 is independent of frequency in the diffuson range . in section",
    "[ scaling ] we discuss scaling properties of the model ( their dependence on parameters @xmath31 and @xmath22 ) .",

    "we discuss the obtained results and compare them with experiment .",
    "in harmonic approximation vibrational properties of a mechanical system of @xmath32 particles are determined by the dynamical matrix @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the force constant matrix and @xmath35 are the particle masses .",
    "the matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real , symmetric and _ positively definite _ matrices @xmath38 ( for simplicity we will consider a scalar model ) .",
    "the condition of positive definiteness is important .",
    "it ensures mechanical stability of the system .",
    "one can always present every real , symmetric and positive definite matrix @xmath36 in the following form  @xcite @xmath39 here @xmath13 is some real matrix of a general form ( not necessarily symmetric ) . and , vice versa , for every real matrix @xmath13 the product @xmath12 is always a positively definite symmetric matrix .",
    "matrices @xmath12 belong to wishart ensemble  @xcite . the eigenvalue distribution for such kind of large random matrices was firstly investigated in  @xcite .",
    "for a free mechanical system it is necessary to satisfy also conditions  @xcite @xmath40 ( for simplicity we consider below all masses @xmath41 ) .",
    "it ensures that the potential energy of the system @xmath42 and forces between the particles depend only on the differences of particle displacements @xmath43 . as a result , the potential energy and forces",
    "are not changed under any translation of the system as a whole .",
    "these conditions are necessary ( but not sufficient ) for existence of low frequency acoustic phonon - like modes in the system . if conditions ( [ s6cv1 ] ) are violated , we have spatially pinned system where propagation of goldstone modes ( phonons ) is not possible .    in structural glasses in many cases ( as , for example , in vitreous silica or amorphous silicon ) a mass disorder is not important and we usually deal with the force constant disorder .",
    "it is related to fluctuations of valence bond lengths and valence bond angles because of an absence of crystalline ordering .",
    "since valence forces depend exponentially on the distances between the atoms , they can experience strong fluctuations .",
    "due to positional disorder there are also fluctuations of long distance coulomb forces in non covalent materials .",
    "thus the force - constant disorder plays an essential role in glassy dynamics .",
    "therefore , one may expect that some important properties of glasses can be reproduced if we take matrix @xmath13 as a random one .",
    "as soon as the random elastic spring constants @xmath44 connecting the particles are fixed , the exact equilibrium particle positions are no longer important for particle dynamic on a long length scales much bigger than the interatomic distances .",
    "they do not enter to the dynamical matrix @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to consider harmonic _ lattice models _ involving only force constant disorder .",
    "if disorder is sufficiently strong , then it automatically includes the coordination number disorder since any weak bonding is equivalent to a negligibly small interaction between the two neighbors . also , if the average coordination number is sufficiently big , its exact value and , therefore , the type of the lattice is of no importance as well .",
    "the similar considerations concern polarization of the modes .",
    "a vectorial character of vibrations in real glasses makes the issue to be more complicated .",
    "many universal properties of glasses ( as , for example , the thermal conductivity ) are not related to polarization of the modes .",
    "therefore , for better understanding of the physics involved it is often instructive to exploit scalar models . in these models",
    "the problem of zero frequency modes existing in vectorial isostatic lattices  @xcite does not exist  @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , different scalar models were successfully used in glassy physics in the past  @xcite .    due to the reasons mentioned above we , as in  @xcite , consider the case of a simple cubic lattice with @xmath32 particles and lattice constant @xmath45 .",
    "each particle has its unique integer index @xmath46 which takes values from @xmath47 to @xmath32 .",
    "we construct the random matrix @xmath13 as follows .",
    "the non - diagonal elements @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 ) we take as independent random numbers from gaussian distribution with zero mean @xmath50 and unit variance @xmath51 if @xmath46-th and @xmath52-th particles are nearest neighbors . for each particle in a simple cubic lattice",

    "( [ we45 ] ) . as was shown in  @xcite , in a @xmath0 simple cubic lattice each particle is connected by elastic springs with @xmath58 neighbors .",
    "the elastic spring constants are random and can be either positive or negative .",
    "a negative spring by definition is a spring which expands after initial stretching and shrinks after initial contraction .",
    "the effect of negative spring constants on atomic vibrations was discussed in different papers  @xcite .    to elucidate where this coordination number 24 in @xmath0 case comes from ,",
    "let us first consider as example a @xmath57 simple square lattice .",
    "in this case each particle interacts with 12 neighbors shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : dyn_matrix ] . in accordance to eq .",
    "( [ we45 ] ) , matrix elements connecting central black particle with its 4 nearest neighbors are of the type @xmath59 from eq .",

    "( [ z8bn ] ) @xmath62 since averaged values @xmath15 and different non - diagonal matrix elements @xmath48 are statistically independent from each other , the average value @xmath63 is determined by the first two quadratic terms in eq .",

    "it corresponds to positive average elastic spring @xmath64 between particles 0 and 1 @xmath65 though , according to gaussian distribution of @xmath66 , the spring constant @xmath67 can take negative values as well .",

    "together we have 24 particles interacting with the central black particle .",
    "all these 24 spring constants can be either positive or negative but to ensure the mechanical stability of the whole system they are correlated with each other in a rather tangly way .",
    "distributions of different spring constants are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : kdistr ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath67 is asymmetric with positive mean value .",

    "the resulting distribution of all spring constants was calculated numerically in  @xcite .",
    "the number of negative springs was found to be about 45% .",
    "one can find a similarity between our spring constant distributions and dynamical matrix element distributions obtained in  @xcite for ic - glass , in  @xcite for simple fluid with short - ranged interactions ( see fig .  1 in these papers ) , and in  @xcite for realistic model of amorphous silicon ( see figs  2.12 , 2.13 ) .",
    "though it is difficult to compare our scalar model with vector models analyzed in  @xcite .    concluding this part , we can easily include into consideration the next neighbor shell for matrix @xmath13 .",
    "then , in addition to the previous case , the matrix elements of the type @xmath89 should be taken into account . as a result",
    "the coordination number for matrix @xmath36 in simple cubic lattice increases up to 90 .",
    "just opposite , applying some additional constraints , we can reduce the coordination number from 24 to smaller numbers or make it fluctuating quantity , etc .",
    "we have checked that all these modifications can lead to quantitative changes but do not change qualitatively the main results of the paper .",

    "in other two directions we used the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "then , solving the system of linear newton equations , we found the new equilibrium positions of all other particles in the sample and calculated restoring forces @xmath128 acting on the displaced particles on the right boundary . due to randomness of the elastic bonds ,",
    "the restoring forces are also random .",
    "let @xmath129 be the average restoring force .",

    "however this approach is rather difficult to implement for computer simulations in the case when @xmath119 . in this case",
    "we have phonons in the lattice with long mean free paths .",
    "and samples with much bigger sizes are necessary .    therefore , to calculate the diffusivity @xmath2 for arbitrary value of @xmath22 ( including the case of @xmath114 ) , we used another approach . in this approach edwards and thouless formula  @xcite , @xmath463 , was used .",

    "a relative amount of phonons is small and almost all delocalized vibrations are diffusons .",

    "presumably they are also accounted for the mysterious @xmath399 dependence of the vibrational line width @xmath398 observed in many experiments on inelastic x - ray scattering in glasses .",
