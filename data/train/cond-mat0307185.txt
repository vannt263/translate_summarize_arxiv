    "when a magnetic impurity is located in the bulk of a metal it undergoes a non - trivial many - body scattering with the electronic states at the fermi energy , @xmath0 , called the kondo effect @xcite . the bulk kondo effect ( to be contrasted with the surface kondo effect studied in this paper ) is one of the best studied problems in condensed matter physics and many different techniques from renormalization group @xcite to bethe ansatz @xcite have been used over the years .",
    "the basic mechanism of the kondo effect is the magnetic screening of the impurity ( the formation of the kondo singlet ) at temperatures @xmath1 below the kondo temperature @xmath2 . above @xmath2",
    "the magnetic impurity behaves paramagnetically but for @xmath3 a resonance is formed close to the fermi surface .",
    "the kondo effect is very important in modern condensed matter theory and appears in many different areas of research , from u and ce intermetallics ( heavy - fermions ) @xcite to quantum dots @xcite .",
    "there is a wide variety of phenomena that can be described within the universality of the kondo problem .",
    "the kondo effect can be observed experimentally in measurements of the temperature dependence of resistivity ( the so - called resistivity minimum ) @xcite , and also in thermodynamic measurements such as specific heat and magnetic susceptibility @xcite of dilute magnetic alloys , due to the enhancement of the density of states close to the fermi energy ( the abrikosov - suhl resonance @xcite ) .",
    "the enhancement of the density of states is related to the change of the characteristic energy scales from @xmath0 to @xmath4 and therefore in the density of states from @xmath5 to @xmath6 since @xmath7 .",
    "the kondo effect was also observed recently in stm studies of magnetic atoms on metallic surfaces @xcite ( see fig.[fig - system ] ) . in a stm experiment electrons from a sharp tip tunnel into the material to be studied , creating a tunneling current @xmath8 due to the application of a potential @xmath9 . roughly speaking a stm experiment measures the local density of states at the fermi energy via the differential tunneling conductance @xmath10 @xcite . when a stm tip is away from the magnetic impurity it measures the substrate density of states , @xmath11 ; however , close to the impurity ( that we call the adatom ) electrons from the tip can tunnel directly to the impurity .",
    "the theory of stm is far from trivial because electrons from the tip not only tunnel to the adatom but also to the bulk and surface states , that is , there are various different channels of tunneling that lead to interference effects that have to be taken into consideration for the proper interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "is the distance of the adatom to the surface , @xmath12 is the distance of the stm tip from the surface , and @xmath13 is the distance , along the surface , between the stm tip and the adatom.,width=226 ]    the basic starting point for the study of the kondo effect is the anderson impurity hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for an electron on a localized atomic state ( impurity state ) with angular momentum labelled by @xmath17 , energy @xmath18 and spin @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for an electron on the conduction band with dispersion @xmath23 and momentum @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the number operator , @xmath26 is the coulomb energy for the double occupancy of the impurity state , and @xmath27 is the hybridization energy between the impurity and conduction states ( the electron operators obey anti - commutation rules : @xmath28 ) .",
    "one of the characteristics of the anderson impurity model is the distinction between substrate and adatom wavefunctions .",
    "although most theoretical works do not question the distinction made _ a priori _ between these quantum states , it turns out that this distinction is not completely natural .",
    "the reason is very simple : when an impurity atom is introduced in a metal , it hybridizes with the metallic states losing its identity .",
    "however , it leaves behind a phase shift @xmath29 in the original metallic states .",
    "thus , the impurity state can not be really distinguished from the host states from the quantum mechanical point of view .",
    "nevertheless , anderson @xcite makes the point that because the d - orbitals are a inner shell , the coulomb energy @xmath26 for double occupancy of those orbitals is large and they must be distinguished from metallic states where the coulomb energy is strongly suppressed by screening effects .",
    "thus , the distinction between these two types of states can only be clearly made when these states are orthogonal to each other so that the impurity does not cause a direct perturbation in the substrate spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , even in metals where the electronic bands are generated out of d - orbitals ( as in the case of cu ) , the strong metallic bonding leads to a large s - wave character of the bands and to very small overlap with the adatom d - orbitals ( that is , these states are `` naturally '' orthogonal @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , this orthogonality can only be distinguished _",
    "a posteriori_. in fact , we have found , by direct numerical computation , that this is the case in the surface kondo effect . finally , as pointed out by anderson @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) , the orthogonality of these states is not fundamental for the magnetic phenomenon which is essentially a local effect and all the subtleties associated with orthogonality become encapsulated into the hybridization matrix elements @xmath27 which become a phenomenological parameter to be obtained indirectly from the experiment .",
    "however , in trying to understand the stm experiments , and especially the role played by the surface and bulk states , we can not simply take these matrix elements as phenomenological parameters since we would not be able to separate the contributions coming from the bulk and the surface of the cu substrate .",
    "hence , in this paper we follow the scheme proposed by tsvelik and wiegmann @xcite and work with non - orthogonalized states . in this case",
    "the hybridization energies are given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the atomic state of the impurity which is localized on the impurity site ( that is , it decays exponentially away from the impurity ) and @xmath32 is the bloch wavefunction of the crystal .",
    "the hybridization energy depends not only on the amplitude but also on the direction of @xmath24 .",
    "nevertheless , it is usually assumed that the hybridization is constant in momentum space , that is , @xmath33 .",
    "although this assumption maybe warranted for spherical gapless fermi surfaces ( since the momentum dependence  averages out \" and most of the interesting physics occurs at the fermi surface ) it is not valid for metals where the chemical potential crosses gaps in the electronic spectrum .",
    "the kondo hamiltonian can be obtained from ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the limit of @xmath34 via the schrieffer - wolf transformation @xcite that maps the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) onto : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the impurity spin , @xmath37 is the electron spin at the impurity site ( @xmath38 with @xmath39 are pauli matrices ) and @xmath40 is the exchange interaction between local spins and conduction electrons ( the energy is measured relative to the fermi energy ) . in going from ( [ hamiltonian ] ) to ( [ kondo_hamiltonian_1 ] )",
    "we have disregarded a series of physical processes that can not be described as spin exchange interactions , foremost being the variable occupancy of the impurity site .",
    "even simple metals like cu have energy gaps in their electronic spectrum due to the periodic potential generated by the cu ions @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is well - known that for cu along the ( 111 ) direction there is a gap of @xmath41 ev at the fermi energy while there are no gaps along the ( 100 ) direction ( see fig.[fs ] ) . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath27 does not exist for bulk states when @xmath42 points along the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "however , because of the bulk gap , one has a surface state in the cu(111 ) surface @xcite ( a state that decays exponentially in the ( 111 ) direction but it is extended in the directions perpendicular to ( 111 ) ) that can hybridize with the impurity located on the cu(111 ) surface . on the other hand , there are no surface states in the ( 100 ) direction to hybridize with an impurity located on the cu(100 ) surface , although bulk states hybridize with it since their wavefunctions decay exponentially outside of the crystal .",
    "previous studies @xcite on the surface kondo effect either assume a momentum - independent hybridization @xmath43 or sum average over a gapless fermi surface @xcite . by ignoring momentum dependence or the gap structure of the fermi surface , the comparison between cu(111 ) and cu(100 ) surface kondo effects of noble metals is not possible .",
    "in fact , we show that recent stm experiments of atoms located in the cu(111 ) and cu(100 ) surfaces have been interpreted incorrectly because of these differences .",
    "in particular , we show that the surface kondo effect between a magnetic atom located on the cu(111 ) surface and the cu(111 ) surface state is quantitatively similar to the surface kondo effect of a magnetic atom on a cu(100 ) surface with bulk states .",
    "the main reason for this similarity comes from the fact that the bulk state that dominates the kondo scattering is the one with the largest penetration in the work - function barrier , that is , the state with momentum perpendicular to the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "the state with momentum perpendicular to the cu(100 ) surface has essentially the same decay rate out of the crystal as the surface state in the cu(111 ) surface and therefore similar hybridization with the magnetic impurity .",
    "-l is the ( 111 ) direction ( notice the absence of states due to the bulk gap ) ; @xmath44-x is the ( 100 ) direction.,width=226 ]    in the presence of the tip new terms have to be added to the hamiltonian ( 1 ) that describe the tunneling processes of tip - to - adatom and tip - to - substrate @xcite .",
    "the tunneling processes of tip - to - adatom is given by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) annihilates ( creates ) and electron at the tip and @xmath48 is the hybridization energy between tip and adatom .",
    "the tip - to - substrate hybridization is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the hybridization energy between substrate ( bulk or surface state ) and adatom .",
    "the tip hamiltonian is simply @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy of the electron states on the tip .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the tip - substrate - adsorbate system is @xmath53 . as in the case of ( [ hamiltonian ] )",
    "the hybridization energies are given by : @xmath54 with @xmath55 labeling the wavefunctions , @xmath56 , for substrate , adatom and tip , respectively .",
    "notice that the complexity in this problem comes from the interference between the different channels of tunneling .    in the present work",
    ", we will consider the case of co on cu surfaces while our theory is applicable to any magnetic adatom on noble metal surfaces .",
    "our main objectives are : ( _ i _ ) the calculation of the hybridization matrix elements between the different wavefunctions in the problem ( bulk , surface , impurity , and stm tip ) with the smallest number of adjustable parameters , and ( _ ii _ ) the description of the surface kondo effect via stm measurements .",
    "while the spectrum of bulk and surface states is readily available in the literature , very little has been published on the actual form of the states . instead of embarking on a complicated calculation of wavefunctions via heavy numerical techniques , we opted for a simpler approach that can provide quantitative results that can be directly compared to the experiment as well as intuitive understanding of the problem . as we are going to show , our simplified models have limitations in explaining some of the available stm data and more detailed work is required .",
    "we hope our work stimulates other works that make use of more sophisticated methods to calculate the matrix elements because , as we are going to show , they are fundamental for the understanding of magnetism in metallic surfaces .",
    "we model the periodic potential inside of the crystal in the nearly - free electron approximation and obtain the bulk gaps as observed in metallic cu .",
    "the surface states are obtained after the modeling of the surface potential in terms of the image charge in the vacuum .",
    "the energies of surface states and resonances in each surface are in very good agreement with photoemission results in cu(111 ) and cu(100 ) surfaces . following the literature in stm theory ,",
    "the impurity is modeled via standard hydrogen - like wave functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec - wavefunction ] , we model the ionic potentials that give rise to the wavefunctions of the metallic host , adatom , and the stm tip . using the wavefunctions and their spectrum we discuss the cu band structure , both the bulk and cu(111 ) surface state . in sec .",
    "[ sec - hybridization ] we present the results for the hybridization matrix elements that determine the hybridization energies as a function of the distance from the surface and adatom and also as a function of the momentum .",
    "the surface kondo effect is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - surface - kondo ] in the context of the schrieffer - wolf transformation and the slave - boson mean - field theory . using the calculated hybridization energies",
    "the differential conductance is calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec - stm ] and compared with the stm data .",
    "[ sec - conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we obtain wavefunctions needed to calculate the tunneling matrix elements ( [ tunneling ] ) .",
    "this is the first step towards the stm differential conductance . as discussed in the introduction we are going to use simple models for the various potentials involved in the problem so that we can make analytical progress in calculating the hybridization energies .",
    "metallic cu is a very good metal with a nearly spherical fermi surface except for the gaps in the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "these gaps have their origin in the periodic potential generated by the ions ( see fig.[fs ] ) .",
    "although the cu states can be obtained from first principle calculations @xcite we adopt the nearly free electron approximation and model the bulk potential with a simple periodic function .",
    "furthermore , in order to study the surface states we consider a semi - infinite crystal where the bulk is located at @xmath57 ( see fig .  [ fig - potential ] ) .",
    "we write the potential in the substrate as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the bulk potential , @xmath17 is the lattice spacing in the direction of the surface , @xmath60 is the work function measured from the bottom of the conduction band , @xmath61 is the image plane , chosen in such a way that the image potential joins the constant potential @xmath62 continuously , and is related to @xmath63 as @xmath64 in the potential eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , @xmath63 is the only free parameter .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies for the schrdinger equation associated with the potential ( [ potential ] ) can be calculated exactly and the details are given in appendix a.    let us consider first the case of the ( 111 ) direction . in order to fit the experimental band structure@xcite along the ( 111 ) direction in the nearly - free - electron potential we find that @xmath65 ev , @xmath66 ev . these values provide a very good description of the band gap in the ( 111 ) direction and also of the ionization energy of metallic cu .",
    "the cu(111 ) surface has a band of surface states as measured by photoemission , starting @xmath67 mev below the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "by solving the schrdinger problem for the potential ( [ potential ] ) we find the surface band ( see appendix a ) and fix the value of @xmath68 in order to fit the photoemission results",
    ". using this value for @xmath63 , we also obtain the next surface state at @xmath69 mev below the vacuum level .",
    "this result agrees well with photoemission experiments that find the second surface state at @xmath70 mev below the vacuum level@xcite .",
    "thus , we were able to get a consistent description of two independent experiments with a single fitting parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig - wavefunction ] we show a plot of the surface state wavefunction as a function of the distance away from the surface ( the wavefunction is chosen to be a real function ) .",
    "notice the slow decay of this state inside the crystal in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "ev below the fermi surface .",
    "the vertical axis represents its normalized wavefunction multiplied by the box size @xmath71 .",
    "the horizontal axis represents @xmath72 in @xmath73.,width=302 ]    in the 3-dimensional @xmath74-space of cu , a gaped  cavity \" is centered around the ( 111 ) direction near the fermi level and has the bulk band surrounding this gaped region @xcite . by decomposing the momentum of a bulk state @xmath75 into @xmath76 ( perpendicular to the surface ) and @xmath77 ( parallel to the surface ) , one expects that the larger @xmath78 , the larger wavefunction tail outside the crystal , which makes a significant difference on their contributions to the surface kondo effect . as a result",
    ", it is important to carefully exclude the ( 111 ) gaped region from the fermi sphere when calculating the surface kondo effect .",
    "it is known that a nearly - free - electron band has a parabolic dispersion not too close to the band edge , where  band edge \" refers to the interface between the bulk band and the gap in the 3d @xmath74-space .",
    "when calculating the stm tunneling conductance , one would have to include the contribution close to the band edge as well .",
    "however , the band - edge contribution is typically much smaller than the one coming from the parabolic band , so we can take merely the contribution from the parabolic band . for the cu(111 ) band ,",
    "we terminate the parabolic band @xmath79 ev below the band edge .",
    "as long as we work in a parabolic band , the bulk - state wavefunction inside the crystal takes a plane - wave form .",
    "we now turn to the case of the ( 100 ) direction .",
    "we find that we get good agreement with band structure calculations @xcite by choosing @xmath80 ev , and @xmath81 ev . in contrast to the ( 111 ) direction , the ( 100 ) direction has no true surface state near the fermi surface .",
    "however , there is a surface resonance at @xmath82 ev above the fermi level @xcite that can be well described by choosing @xmath83 .",
    "when calculating the tunneling conductance , we can safely sum over the entire fermi sphere and adopt a parabolic dispersion , i.e. a plane - wave wavefunction inside the crystal .",
    "it is the d - orbital of the adatom that actually participates in the kondo resonance .",
    "when one of these atoms is placed on a metal surface , its outmost s - wave electrons either get transfered to the metal conduction band or to its own d - orbital .",
    "for example , the co adatom tends to form [ ar]@xmath84 on a cu surface@xcite and therefore has an effective spin @xmath85 . as a result ,",
    "an adatom d - wavefunction can be modeled as a hydrogen atom with an effective charge @xmath86 given by : @xmath87 where @xmath88 are spherical harmonics and @xmath89 are hydrogen radial wavefunctions .",
    "the effective charge @xmath90 can be determined by comparing @xmath91 , defined by , @xmath92 with the experimentally observed d - orbital radius for metallic co , @xmath93  . in our calculation",
    "we orient the axis of quantization for the atomic problem along the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the stm tip wavefunction is modeled following tersoff and hamann@xcite who proposed a wavefunction of the form : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the radius of curvature of the tip about its center , the decay constant @xmath96 controls the wavefunction tail , and @xmath97 is the tip work function .",
    "notice that the adatom and tip wavefunctions are normalizable , that is , @xmath98 , when integrated over the entire space .",
    "the set of three different wavefunctions ( substrate , adatom , and tip ) are the main elements required for the calculation of the hybridization energies in the anderson impurity hamiltonian .",
    "using the results of eq.([surface - wavefunction ] ) , ( [ co ] ) and ( [ tip ] ) we can evaluate the overlap integrals in ( [ tunneling ] ) that are important for the hybridization energies . let us first remark that the normalization of each of these wavefunctions is different ; for instance , the bulk state is normalized in a box of size @xmath99 , where @xmath71 is one of the dimensions of the box . the surface state , however , since it decays exponentially away from the surface but is extended on the surface , is normalized in an area of size @xmath100 .",
    "finally , the adatom and tip states always decay exponentially and therefore do not require any box normalization .",
    "thus , it is convenient to redefine the wavefunctions so that : @xmath101 where the subscript @xmath102 refers to bulk and @xmath103 to surface .",
    "note that in this case the hybridization energies between substrate ( bulk and surface ) and adatom in ( [ tunneling ] ) can be written as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 for bulk and @xmath106 for surface .",
    "the matrix elements are , therefore , @xmath107 notice that @xmath108 is not only a function of the momentum and the distance @xmath109 between adatom and surface , but also depends on which surface - here labeled by the subscript @xmath110 - the adatom is located .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - v111 ] we show the result for @xmath111 , the hybridization matrix element between @xmath112 adatom state and surface state in the cu(111 ) surface , as obtained by numerical integration of ( [ vd ] ) using ( [ surface - wavefunction ] ) and ( [ co ] ) , as a function of @xmath109 ( in units of the distance between the planes in the ( 111 ) direction ) by assuming @xmath24 to be at the fermi surface of the surface band [ since the surface states have essentially a spherical fermi surface there is no dependence of @xmath113 with the direction on the cu(111 ) surface ] .",
    "the first striking result is the strong oscillation of the value of the matrix element with @xmath109 .",
    "this oscillation is the result of the interference between the d - state of the adatom and the surface state .",
    "naturally , the largest overlap occurs at the surface ( where the surface state is maximum , see fig .",
    "[ fig - wavefunction ] ) but we notice that there is substantial overlap between the surface state and the adatom at one lattice spacing from the surface . in principle , we can not tell what is the actual orientation of the adatom relative to the surface but we have checked that the @xmath112 state is the one with biggest overlap as compared with higher angular momentum states , thus , instead of a sum over the angular momentum states in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) we could have kept only the one with @xmath112 . furthermore ,",
    "first principle calculations for adatoms in metallic surfaces indicate that the atomic orbitals are oriented in such a way to generate the largest overlaps @xcite .    :",

    "[ fig - v111 ] we also plot the value of @xmath117 , the hybridization matrix element between the bulk states and adatom in the cu(111 ) surface as a function of the distance from the surface for two different bulk states , all of the them at the cu fermi surface , with momenta along the @xmath44-x , and @xmath44-k directions ( see fig.[fs ] ) .",
    "once again we notice the oscillations due to the interference between those states and the adatom states but we also observe that the overlap now is a factor of 3 smaller because these states do not have a large amplitude at the surface . another interesting result of these calculations is the fact that as the momenta moves towards the ( 111 ) direction the overlap grows .",
    "this is due to the fact that away from the ( 111 ) direction the fermi surface of cu is essentially spherical and therefore the states at the fermi surface have essentially the same amplitude , however , the states with large momentum along the direction of the cu(111 ) surface have bigger penetration on the potential barrier generated by the work function and therefore larger hybridization with the adatom .",
    "this effect will be very important later for the interpretation of the experimental data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - v100 ] we show the value of @xmath118 for the overlap between the state of an adatom on the cu(100 ) surface with bulk states with momenta along the @xmath44-x ( this direction is perpendicular to the cu(100 ) surface ) , and @xmath44-k ( since there are no surface states for the cu(100 ) surface we do not need to calculate @xmath119 for this surface ) .",
    "besides the oscillations found in the previous calculations , we find that when the momentum is oriented perpendicular to the surface its penetration is maximum and therefore has largest overlap .",
    "in fact , we find that the overlap between the adatom state on a cu(111 ) surface with the surface state is essentially the same value as the overlap between the state of the adatom on the cu(100 ) surface with a bulk state with momentum oriented in the ( 100 ) direction",
    ". one can easily understand this effect from the nearly free electron picture : in the absence of the periodic potential of the crystal , the fermi surface states in the ( 111 ) and ( 100 ) direction would be essentially identical and their decay in the vacuum of their respective surfaces would be the same .",
    "when the periodic potential of the crystal is added a gap opens in the ( 111 ) direction but not on the ( 100 ) direction .",
    "however , the bulk state that disappeared at the fermi surface in the ( 111 ) direction now becomes the surface state in this same surface .",
    "therefore , its amplitude at the surface and close to it is essentially the same as the state in the ( 100 ) direction ( this is can be readily understood due to the long decay rate of the surface state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - wavefunction ] ) and the overlap is essentially the same .",
    "thus , one has to be careful when discussing what happens to adatoms in different surfaces because there is very little difference between surface states along gaped directions and bulk states along non - gaped directions in the fermi surface of noble metals .",

    "there are two main limits of interest in the kondo problem . the first one is reached when @xmath121 and we can treat the hybridization energy as the smallest scale in the problem .",
    "this is the so - called kondo regime where the average occupation of the impurity state is essentially constant , that is , @xmath122 . in order to study this limit",
    "it is convenient to split the electron states into bulk ( b ) and surface ( s ) so that we write the anderson impurity hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as : @xmath123 where @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) describes the bulk ( surface ) electron annihilation operator , respectively .",
    "we have a two - band problem where both bulk and surface states hybridize with the impurity at the surface .",
    "notice that this is a single channel problem since only one effective channel couples to the impurity .    in the kondo limit",
    "we can use a schrieffer - wolf transformation @xcite and rewrite the anderson impurity hamiltonian as a exchange problem : @xmath126 where @xmath36 is the localized impurity spin and @xmath127 is the exchange energy matrix ( we have defined @xmath128 and @xmath129 as the dimensionalities of bulk and surface states , respectively ) , and @xmath130 notice that , unlike the single band kondo effect ( [ kondo_hamiltonian_1 ] ) , electrons from one band can scatter from the impurity between two different bands with spin flip ( all energies are measured relative to the fermi energy ) .",
    "if we ignore the off - diagonal matrix elements of ( [ exchanges ] ) the problem trivially reduces to two independent kondo effects with characteristic kondo temperatures @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the bandwidth cut - off ( @xmath133 ev , @xmath134 ev @xcite ) and @xmath135 is the effective coupling constant , @xmath136 is the fermi surface density of states ( for spherical fermi surface we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the effective mass ) . because of",
    "the difference in the kondo temperatures given in ( [ tk1 ] ) one of the scattering channels dominates the screening process and the singlet state can be either formed with the surface state when @xmath139 or with the bulk states if @xmath140 .",
    "if we apply this argument to the results of the overlap integrals of the previous section we see that for the adatom in the cu(111 ) surface the kondo screening is dominated by the surface state since the coupling constant ( [ ln ] ) is bigger for this state than the bulk states . on the other hand , if the adatom is sitting at the cu(100 ) surface , the kondo effect is dominated by the bulk state with momentum perpendicular to the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "the above discussion is valid as far as the occupation of the impurity level is close to @xmath141 .",
    "however , in the problem at hand the adatom occupation can change substantially with the hybridization since the matrix element is strongly dependent of the distance to the surface and the type of states involved , that is , @xmath27 can be of the order of @xmath142 ( but still much smaller than @xmath26 ) . in this case , the mapping into the kondo problem fails to properly describe the actual occupation on the adatom .",
    "instead , we should start from the anderson impurity hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and compute the kondo temperature directly from it . here",
    "we will do so by adopting the large @xmath143 calculation of newns and read that allows for average fluctuations in the valence of the adatom in the limit of @xmath144 ( in fact , estimates based on lsda@xcite give a value of @xmath145 ev and @xmath146 ev ) .",
    "the idea of the large @xmath143 calculation is to generalize ( [ hamiltonian ] ) to include more degenerate electron states ( besides the @xmath147 states associated with the spin @xmath85 ) and take the limit where the degeneracy diverges .",
    "mathematically this is accomplished by generalizing the spin index in the electron operator to a new index @xmath148 that varies from @xmath141 to @xmath143 .",
    "it is convenient to write anderson impurity hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the limit of @xmath149 as : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the projector operator that projects out any states of the adatom with double occupancy . in the adatom we can , in principle ,",

    "the physical meaning of these parameters becomes clear when we calculate physical observables .",
    "for instance , the average occupation of the impurity is given by : @xmath170 that shows that @xmath72 has to do with the change in the occupancy of the adatom state due to the hybridization with the substrate .",

[ fig - kondo - t111 ] , which clearly means that the surface state dominates the kondo effect .",

    "furthermore , it is clear from ( [ tk2 ] ) , that the kondo temperature is exponentially sensitive on the details of the hybridization and energy scales and therefore is significantly affected by the various assumptions .",
