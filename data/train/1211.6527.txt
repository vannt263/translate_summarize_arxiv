    "the effects of initial rotation on the dynamical evolution of star clusters received substantial attention because the rotation is a natural consequence during the formation process .",
    "the current population of star clusters may not show significant amount of rotation , but it does not mean that the initial conditions inhibit the presence of rotation .",
    "the direct measurement of the rotation is difficult since it requires long integration with large aperture telescope .",
    "rather indirect evidence for the rotation comes from the shape of globular clusters .",
    "although most globular clusters show high degree of circular symmetry , the ellipticity has been measured for large number of star clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the ellipticity is due to the rotational flattening , many clusters still have some degrees of rotation .",
    "even though the amount of rotation in current population of globular clusters is rather small , initial clusters could have been rotating much more rapidly since the rotation phases out as the clusters evolve dynamically .",
    "the effects of rotation on the dynamical evolution have been studied by a number of authors .",
    "@xcite has extended the fokker - planck ( fp ) equation for rotating systems , but his study was limited to slowly rotating systems by imposing the spherical symmetry for the shape of the clusters .",
    "the thermodynamical analyses have been pioneered by @xcite and found that there exists an instability similar to gravothermal catastrophe and they named this phenomenon as ` gravo - gyro catastrophe ' .",
    "theses earlier studies provided the basis of the possible acceleration of dynamical evolution due to the initial rotation .",
    "more careful studies for the rotating systems have been carried out by @xcite using 2-dimensional fp code developed by @xcite .",
    "these papers investigated both isolated and tidally limited clusters , and single and multi - component clusters .",
    "the general result emerged from these studies is that the rotating clusters undergo faster evolution than non - rotating ones for single component models .",
    "the acceleration is also expected in multi - mass models as well , but the degree of acceleration could be significantly reduced since the energy exchange between different mass components is another accelerating process and these two processes compete each other .",
    "the suitability of the fp approach to the study of dynamical evolution of star clusters has been a matter of debate because the absence of the accurate knowledge on the third integral for rotating systems prohibits us to include all the possible integrals in constructing the fp equation .",
    "comparison with @xmath0-body calculation should provide a clue to the validity of the current version of the fp approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a comparison for rotating systems was done by @xcite and @xcite for single component models and showed that the fp results are generally consistent with the @xmath0-body calculations .",
    "we extend the comparison to the two - component models as an interim step to the full multi - mass models .",
    "two - component models have the ingredients for the multi - mass models , but have smaller model parameters . the important difference between single and multi - mass models",
    "is the existence of energy exchange among different mass components . in rotating models",
    ", there is also a possibility of exchange of the specific angular momentum through the dynamical process .",
    "it is much easier to investigate such processes in @xmath0-body .",
    "another motivation for carrying out @xmath0-body simulations and comparing with fp results is to address the validity of the axisymmetric assumption which is inevitable for the fp approaches .",
    "if the cluster rotates rather rapidly , the bar - like structure can form even with the initial assumption of the axisymmetric shape .",
    "the evolution of the elongated cluster could be different from the perfectly axisymmetric one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the models and their parameters in detail .",
    "the effect of the initial rotation on the cluster shape will be presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we will compare @xmath0-body and fp results in various angles .",
    "we will discuss the effects of mass spectra on the dynamical evolution of star clusters in section 5 .",
    "most of fp results for rotating stellar system with initial mass spectrum are based on the 2d fp solver , mfopax @xcite which is the revised version of fopax @xcite suitable for the rotating stellar system with initial mass spectrum . for the complete description of mfopax readers",
    "are referred sections 2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "the nbody code which we used for this study is one of series of direct @xmath0-body programs developed by s. aarseth since 1960s .",
    "each version of the nbody codes has been added some epochal schemes such as the ahmad - cohen neighbor scheme , the kustaaheimo - stiefel or chain regularization scheme @xcite .",
    "more recently , the nbody4 and the nbody6 codes can perform more precise calculations thanks to the 4th - order hermite integrator @xcite .",
    "specially , the nbody4 code is designed for running on the grape , which is a special - purpose machine for only direct @xmath0-body simulations by calculating gravity or coulomb interaction with high parallelization .",
    "we used the grape6-blx64 boards for the @xmath0-body calculations reported in this paper .    to prepare the initial models for the present @xmath0-body",
    "runs we have assigned the positions and the velocities of the stars from the predefined density , potential and distribution function of initial models .",
    "these initial models also used in fp runs are obtained following @xcite and also applied in previous studies @xcite .",
    "globular clusters or open clusters which are typical stellar systems considered in the present study are tidally limited by their host galaxy . to investigate the time evolution of rotating stellar system under the influence of the tidal effect of the host galaxy and to compare the dynamical evolution of rotational stellar system using two different numerical methods ( fp and @xmath0-body )",
    ", we assume that the stellar systems are orbiting around the center of the galaxy with circular orbit , which is already applied in previous fp runs @xcite . in order to directly compare @xmath0-body results with fp methods",
    ", we remove the stars whose total energy exceeding the tidal energy due to the host galaxy instantaneously . according to the @xmath0-body computation",
    ", it takes at least a crossing time to escape from the clusters for stars with total energy larger than the tidal energy .",
    "therefore , instantaneous removal of stars with energy greater than tidal energy is somewhat unrealistic .",
    "the problem becomes more serious for small-@xmath0 systems since the fraction of stars to be unbounded at a given time is higher than large-@xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "however , since the main goal of the present study is to investigate the difference between @xmath0-body and fp methods for rotating stellar systems , we need to apply the same criteria with the fp approach . the tidal boundary ( or tidal energy ) is adjusted during evolution as described in the previous studies @xcite .",

    "<S> , there are significant differences between these two approaches at the early stage of the evolutions because of the development of bar instability in @xmath0-body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the cluster for @xmath0-body simulations becomes tri - axial or even prolate , which can not be produced by the 2-dimensional fp simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the total angular momentum and the total mass of the cluster decrease rapidly while bar - like structure persists . </S>",
    "<S> after the rotational energy becomes smaller than the critical value for the bar instability , the shape of the cluster becomes nearly axisymmetric again , and follows the evolutionary track predicted by the fp equation . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed again that the energy equipartiton is not completely achieved when @xmath1 0.16 . by examining the angular momentum at each mass component </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the exchange of angular momentum between different mass components occurs , similar to the energy exchange leading to the equipartition .    </S>",
