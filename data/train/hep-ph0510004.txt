    "<S> we calculate qcd corrections to transversely polarized drell - yan process at a measured @xmath0 of the produced lepton pair in the dimensional regularization scheme . the @xmath0 distribution is discussed resumming soft gluon effects relevant for small @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> hard processes with polarized nucleon beams enable us to study spin - dependent dynamics of qcd and the spin structure of nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> the helicity distribution @xmath1 of quarks within nucleon has been measured in polarized dis experiments , and @xmath2 of gluons has also been estimated from the scaling violations of them . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the transversity distribution @xmath3 , i.e. the distribution of transversely polarized quarks inside transversely polarized nucleon , can not be measured in inclusive dis due to its chiral - odd nature,@xcite and remains as the last unknown distribution at the leading twist . </S>",
    "<S> transversely polarized drell - yan ( tdy ) process is one of the processes where the transversity distribution can be measured , and has been undertaken at rhic - spin experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> we compute the 1-loop qcd corrections to tdy at a measured @xmath0 and azimuthal angle @xmath4 of the produced lepton in the dimensional regularization scheme . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , the phase space integration in @xmath5-dimension , separating out the relevant transverse degrees of freedom , is required to extract the @xmath6 part of the cross section characteristic of the spin asymmetry of tdy.@xcite the calculation is rather cumbersome compared with the corresponding calculation in unpolarized and longitudinally polarized cases , and has not been performed so far . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the nlo @xmath7 corrections to the tdy cross section in the @xmath8 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we also include soft gluon effects by all - order resummation of logarithmically enhanced contributions at small @xmath0 ( `` edge regions of the phase space '' ) up to next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy , and obtain the first complete result of the @xmath0 distribution for all regions of @xmath0 at nll level .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the nlo @xmath7 corrections to tdy : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denote nucleons with momentum @xmath11 and transverse spin @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the 4-momentum of dy pair . the spin dependent cross section @xmath14 is given as a convolution @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the factorization scale , and @xmath17\\ ] ] is the product of transversity distributions of the two nucleons , and @xmath18 is the corresponding partonic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> note that , at the leading twist level , the gluon does not contribute to the transversely polarized process due to its chiral odd nature . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the one - loop corrections to @xmath18 , which involve the virtual gluon corrections and the real gluon emission contributions , e.g. , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we regularize the infrared divergence in @xmath21 dimension , and employ naive anticommuting @xmath22 which is a usual prescription in the transverse spin channel.@xcite in the @xmath8 scheme , we eventually get,@xcite to nlo accuracy , @xmath23 , \\label{cross section}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 with @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the rapidity of virtual photon , and @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle of one of the leptons with respect to the initial spin axis . for later convenience </S>",
    "<S> , we have decomposed the cross section into the two parts : the function @xmath27 contains all terms that are singular as @xmath28 , while @xmath29 is of @xmath7 and finite at @xmath30 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ cross section ] ) gives the first nlo result in the @xmath8 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we note that there has been a similar nlo calculation of tdy cross section in massive gluon scheme.@xcite we also note that , integrating ( [ cross section ] ) over @xmath0 , our result coincides with the corresponding @xmath0-integrated cross sections obtained in previous works employing massive gluon scheme@xcite and dimensional reduction scheme,@xcite via the scheme transformation relation.@xcite    the cross section ( [ cross section ] ) becomes very large when @xmath38 , due to the terms behaving @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the singular part @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that , in unpolarized and longitudinally polarized dy , large `` recoil logs '' of similar nature appear in each order of perturbation theory as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and so on , corresponding to ll , nll , and higher contributions , respectively , and that the resummation of those `` double logarithms '' to all orders is necessary to obtain a well - defined , finite prediction of the cross section.@xcite because the ll and nll contributions are universal,@xcite we can work out the all - order resummation of the corresponding logarithmically enhanced contributions in ( [ cross section ] ) up to the nll accuracy , based on the general formulation@xcite of the @xmath0 resummation . </S>",
    "<S> this can be conveniently carried out in the impact parameter @xmath43 space , conjugate to the @xmath0 space . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the singular part @xmath27 of ( [ cross section ] ) is modified into the corresponding resummed part , which is expressed as the fourier transform , @xmath44 here @xmath45 , and the large logarithmic corrections are resummed into the sudakov factor @xmath46 with @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 as well as the coefficient functions @xmath50 are calculable in perturbation theory , and at the present accuracy of nll , we get:@xcite @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . we have utilized a relation@xcite between @xmath48 and the dglap kernels in order to obtain the two - loop term of @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the other contributions have been determined so that the expansion of the above formula ( [ resum ] ) in powers of @xmath54 reproduces @xmath27 of ( [ cross section ] ) , ( [ eq : x ] ) to the nlo accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cross section ] ) with ( [ resum ] ) presents the first result of the nll @xmath0 resummation formula for tdy . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo parton distributions in the @xmath8 scheme have to be used .    </S>",
    "<S> one more step is necessary to make the qcd prediction of tdy . similarly to other all - order resuumation formula </S>",
    "<S> , our result ( [ resum ] ) is suffered from the ir renormalons due to the landau pole at @xmath55 in the sudakov factor , and it is necessary to specify a prescription to avoid this singularity . here </S>",
    "<S> we deform the integration contour in ( [ resum ] ) in the complex @xmath43 space , following the method introduced in the joint resummation.@xcite obviously prescription to define the @xmath43 integration is not unique reflecting ir renormalon ambiguity , e.g. , `` @xmath56 prescription '' to `` freeze '' effectively the @xmath43 integration along the real axis is frequently used.@xcite the renormalon ambiguity should be eventually compensated in the physical quantity by the power corrections @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) due to non - perturbative effects . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , we make the replacement @xmath59 in ( [ resum ] ) with the `` minimal '' ansatz for non - perturbative effects , @xcite @xmath60 with a non - perturbative parameter @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows the @xmath0 distribution of tdy at @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 , and with a model for the transversity @xmath3 that saturates the soffer s inequality at a low scale.@xcite solid line shows the nlo result using ( [ cross section ] ) , and the dashed and dot - dashed lines show the nll result using ( [ cross section ] ) , ( [ resum ] ) , @xmath60 , with @xmath65 gev@xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . </S>"
