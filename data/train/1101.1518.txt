    "the outstanding resolution of _ chandra _ has made possible detailed investigations of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "pwne are formed by the relativistic pulsar wind ( pw ) , which shocks in the ambient medium and emits synchrotron radiation .",
    "the pwn morphology depends on the mach number , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the pulsar s velocity relative to the ambient medium , and @xmath15 is the speed of sound .",
    "pwne created by subsonically moving pulsars , such as the famous crab , exhibit `` torus - jet '' morphology , where the torus represents a shocked equatorial wind beyond the ring - like termination shock ( ts ) , while the jets along the pulsar s spin axis are polar outflows . at @xmath16 , when the ram pressure exceeds the ambient pressure , @xmath17 , the ts acquires a bullet - like shape @xcite , and the pwn exhibits a cometary bow - shock morphology , with a long tail behind the moving pulsar .",
    "spectacular examples of such pwne are created by the pulsars j1747@xmath02958 @xcite and j1509@xmath05850 @xcite .",
    "the tails may coexist with pulsar jets , often aligned with the proper motion direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting modification of bow - shock pwne is expected when the pulsar is in a high - mass binary system .",
    "in such a system , the pulsar moves in the wind emanating from the high - mass companion , and the bow - shock pwn is produced by the collision of the relativistic pw with the dense nonrelativistic wind of the companion ( instead of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the case of a solitary pulsar ) .",
    "the overall appearance , luminosity , and spectrum of such a pwn depend on the ratio of the momentum fluxes carried by the winds , the velocities @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the companion s wind and the pulsar s orbital motion , the temperature and density of the companion s wind , the anisotropy of the outflows , and the separation between the pulsar and the companion .",
    "as these parameters vary along the orbit , the pwn s luminosity , spectrum , shape , size , and orientation should also vary .",
    "if such a pwn can be resolved , observations of the variable pwn morphology would allow a more definitive study of the wind properties than observations of an unresolved pwn + binary system .",
    "a promising target for such studies is the well - known binary system psr b1259@xmath063/ss2883 .",
    "psr b1259@xmath063 ( hereafter b1259 ) is a middle - aged radio pulsar , with the period @xmath20 ms , spin - down age @xmath21 kyr , spin - down power @xmath22 ergs s@xmath4 , and magnetic field @xmath23 g @xcite .",

    "tev emission from this system near periastron was detected with the hess observatory @xcite .",
    "the multi - year observations have shown that its x - ray flux and spectrum vary with orbital phase .",
    "for instance , the 1@xmath010 kev energy flux is at minimum , @xmath34 erg @xmath35 s@xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath36 ergs s@xmath4 ) at apastron , while it is a factor of 20 higher nine days before periastron .",
    "the slope of its power - law ( pl ) spectrum also varies , from @xmath37 ( at apastron ) to 1.2 ( 25 days before periastron ) to 2.0 ( at periastron ) .",
    "no pulsations with the radio pulsar period have been detected from the system outside the radio range .",
    "the orbital variations of the x - ray flux and spectrum have been explained by a model in which the x - ray emission is generated in a pwn formed by the colliding winds ; the pwn becomes more compact and luminous when the pulsar crosses the equatorial disk outflow ( angular half - width of about 20@xmath38 ) of the be companion , tilted with respect to the orbital plane by an angle @xmath39 25@xmath38 ( ta97 ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is no general consensus on the x - ray emission mechanism ( synchrotron emission or inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of companion s optical / uv photons ) .",
    "it would be interesting to study the unusual pwn of b1259 in x - rays , but , at realistic wind parameters , the characteristic size of the ts surface ( @xmath40 0@xmath4101 ) in the b1259 pwn is too small to resolve it even with _",
    "chandra_. on the other hand , we know from the models of bow - shock pwne and observations of supersonic solitary pulsars that the flow speed in the collimated tail behind the moving pulsar can be so high that the length of the observable part of the tail can exceed the characteristic ts size by a very large factor @xcite , despite the fast synchrotron and ic cooling of the emitting relativistic particles .",
    "the tail in the immediate vicinity of the binary should be oriented along the vector @xmath42 , i.e. , almost along the line connecting the be star and the pulsar ( as @xmath43 ) .",
    "the tail should rotate with the binary period , so that its large - scale appearance would resemble an archimedes spiral @xcite .",
    "optimal binary phases to search for the outflow are near the apastron , when the pointlike source emission is the faintest , and the size of the bow - shock pwn is the largest .",
    "we should note that the four _ chandra _ observations taken near the periastron of 2007 @xcite were not suitable for detecting extended emission because they were short ( 37 ks ) and used either continuous clocking mode ( which produces only one - dimensional image ) or high energy transmission grating .",
    "in addition to the tail outflow , a high - resolution image may show pulsar jets , which can penetrate through the companion s wind , and whose orientation would not show any orbital dependence .    to search for extended x - ray emission from the pwn tail and pulsar jets , and to better understand the nature of stellar and pulsar winds and their interaction , we observed b1259 with _ chandra _ near apastron of 2009 .",

    "the observed angular size of the compact pwn , @xmath11 , which corresponds to the projected length of @xmath154 cm , and the fact that the pwn is seen only on one side of the pulsar , put a constraint on the average flow speed : @xmath155 .",
    "such high flow speeds have been obtained in numerical models for tails of bow - shock pwne of solitary pulsars ( e.g. , @xmath156@xmath157 in the narrow central channel of the tail , and @xmath158@xmath159 in the tail s `` sheath '' , in the models by bucciantini et al .",
    "2005 ) , but these speeds may become lower at large distances from the pulsar because of the interaction with the ambient medium ( this effect was not included in the numerical models ) .",
    "observations of tails behind supersonically moving solitary pulsars also show rather high flow speeds  for instance , @xmath160 for the 6 pc tail behind psr j15095850 @xcite .",
    "even higher flow speeds , corresponding to bulk motion lorentz factors @xmath161 up to @xmath162 , were obtained by @xcite in hydrodynamical simulations of flows produced by the collision of the relativistic ( pulsar ) and nonrelativistic ( be star ) winds in a binary system .",
    "the ultrarelativistic flows are formed when the ratio @xmath163 of the momentum flux from the pulsar to that from the be star exceeds @xmath164 , in which case the ts surface becomes `` unclosed '' ( i.e. , the back surface of the ts bullet disappears ) . in the case of b1259 , @xmath163 may vary between @xmath126 and @xmath165 along the binary orbit , being as large as 0.11 around apastron ( when the pw interacts with the so - called polar component of the be star outflow ) .",
    "if the confined flow indeed reaches such high speeds , it can penetrate farther into the ambient medium , which makes the suggested interpretation of the observed asymmetric emission even more plausible .",
    "@xcite note that the properties of the observed x - ray and vhe emission from b1259 are not compatible with the strong doppler boosting corresponding to such large @xmath161 .",
    "however , it is possible that , while the bulk of the observed high - energy emission is generated within ( or very close to ) the binary , where the flow is only mildly relativistic , the extended emission is generated by electrons supplied by the accelerated flow that slows down at large distances from the binary .",
    "the interpretation of the compact pwn as a shocked pw outside the binary can constrain the wind paramenters in various models of b1259 .",
    "the x - ray pwn emission could be due to synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons , accelerated at the inner shock front within the binary ( ta97 ) . to generate x - ray photons , @xmath166 kev , the electron energy @xmath167 and the magnetic field @xmath168 should be high enough : @xmath169 ( where @xmath168 is in units of gauss ) . on the other hand , the cooling time , @xmath170 , for the relativistic electrons in the flow should be longer than the flow time , @xmath171 s , where @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "generally , both the synchrotron cooling in the magnetic field and ic cooling in the radiation field of the be companion can be important . at the very high energies of electrons emitting synchrotron x - rays , @xmath174 ( where @xmath175 ev is the mean photon energy ) , the ic cooling occurs in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "the ic cooling rate in this regime is much lower than in the thomson regime : @xmath176 , and it is much lower than the synchrotron cooling rate beyond the binary orbit .",
    "therefore , the cooling time is determined by synchrotron radiation , @xmath177 s , and it exceeds the flow time at @xmath178 .",
    "taking into account the condition @xmath179 derived above , we obtain @xmath180 for the typical magnetic field and lorentz factor .",
    "the upper limit on magnetic field is much lower than the magnetic field in the ultracompact intrabinary pwn ( e.g. , @xmath181 g in the ta97 model ) , while the lower limit on lorentz factor is close to @xmath182 of the electron energy spectrum in the shocked ( uncooled ) pw within the binary ( ta97 ) . to reconcile such high energies and low magnetic fields with the intrabinary pwn models ,",
    "one has to assume that the radiating electrons are additionally accelerated in the tail , in some internal shocks or via magnetic field reconnection that transforms the magnetic field energy into the kinetic energy of particles .",
    "as noted by chernyakova et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2009 ) , the ta97 model can not explain some of the observed properties of the b1259 s radiation ( such as the hardening of the x - ray spectrum near periastron ) .",
    "these authors ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) discuss another model ( first considered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which the x - ray emission is generated by the ic scattering of stellar photons off moderately relativistic electrons with lorentz factors @xmath183100 ( much lower than in the ta97 model ) .",
    "as such scattering occurs in the thomson regime , the cooling rate is @xmath184 , where @xmath185 ev @xmath29 is the photon energy density at the distance @xmath186 cm from the be companion ( approximately equal to the distance from the binary at @xmath187 ) , and @xmath188 erg s@xmath4 is the luminosity of the stellar companion . at realistic values of the magnetic field , @xmath189 @xmath190 g , the photon energy density exceeds the magnetic energy density , so the ic cooling is more efficient .",
    "taking into account that @xmath191 , the electron s energy at distance @xmath141 is given by the equation @xmath192^{-1}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath193 , @xmath194 .",
    "if we assume @xmath195100 close to the binary orbit at apastron ( @xmath196 cm ) , then @xmath197@xmath198 , which means that the total relative energy loss by an electron , @xmath199^{-1 } \\approx \\gamma_0/\\gamma_c$ ] , is very small at realistic @xmath200100 km s@xmath4 . moreover , the upper limit on the x - ray efficiency of the resolved pwn between distances @xmath201 and @xmath202 from the binary , @xmath203/\\gamma_0 \\sim ( \\gamma_0/\\gamma_c)r_0 ( r_1^{-1 } - r_2^{-1 } ) \\sim 10^{-6 } ( \\gamma_0/30 ) v_{9.5}^{-1}\\left(r_{1,17}^{-1}-r_{2,17}^{-1}\\right)$ ] , is much smaller than the observed value , @xmath204 .",
    "this means that the observed extended x - ray emission can not be explained by the ic scattering , and the synchrotron emission of electrons with tev energies is a more plausible interpretation .    the suggested interpretation of the compact pwn as a bent tail of the shocked pw blown out of the binary by the wind of",
    "the be companion implies that the compact pwn rotates around the pointlike source with the binary period , and its size and luminosity should depend on binary phase .",
    "this can be verified by observing this system with _",
    "chandra _ at different binary phases .    if these observations show the compact pwn at the same position with respect to the pulsar , another interpretation would be required to explain the extended emission . in principle",
    ", it might be a tail or trail of shocked pw behind the moving binary blown out by the head - on wind of the ambient ism matter .",
    "the proper motion of b1259 has not been measured yet , but the speed of the high - mass binary should be much lower than that of a solitary pulsar , so that it would be hard to explain even so short tail / trail as caused by the motion of b1259 in the ism .    finally , we note that strong evidence of extended emission around another @xmath205-ray binary , the microquasar ls 5039 , has been recently found in a _",
    "acis observation @xcite .",
    "it shows that the compact object in ls 5039 is likely a rotation - powered pulsar rather than an accreting neutron star or a black hole .",
    "it also means that b1259 is not the only high - mass x - ray binary surrounded by an extended pwn .",
    "we thank nicholas lee and the cxc calibration team for the discussion of the mirror misalignment effect on acis images , and maria chernyakova for the discussion of the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of b1259 near apastron .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee , whose remarks has allowed us to improve the presentation .",
