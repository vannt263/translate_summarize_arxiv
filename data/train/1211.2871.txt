    "single crystals of pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , x=0.15 ( optimally - doped ) and 0.17 ( over - doped ) were synthesized via a flux method refined by peng @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "thus , the thicknesses of the indented gasket and sample were 40 @xmath17 m and 10 @xmath17 m , respectively .",
    "measurements were stopped on compression when the gasket thinned down such that the sample was in direct contact with the diamonds .",
    "we note that the material under study can not withstand an uniaxial pressure larger than 0.5 gpa @xcite . in the present resistivity measurement the pressure corresponding to gasket collapse was larger than 43 gpa .",

    "this is of interest because for the case of the undoped pr@xmath10cuo@xmath2 at 37.2 gpa there is still 50@xmath3 of the t@xmath4 phase surviving @xcite .",
    "while we believe the differences are mostly intrinsic , the different pressure media used ( n2 gas in wilhelm @xmath15 @xcite vs. the more hydrostatic ne gas in the present study ) may have a sizable influence .",

    "relatively low pressure the resistivity versus temperature curves show what resembles a superconducting transition ( but with non - zero resistivity below t@xmath7 ) and enhancement of resistivity close to t@xmath7 ( left inset of fig .",
    "this enhancement of the resistivity near t@xmath7 , is due in part to a slight inclination of the sample cleaved face from the cuo@xmath10 planes @xcite and in part to granular effects within the crystal @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that this resistivity enhancement near t@xmath7 is due to inhomogeneities in ce doping ( as proposed by klimczuk @xmath15 @xcite ) given that the enhancement in the x=0.15 crystal ( as seen in resistivity data at 4.5 gpa ) is measured on a 10 @xmath17 m thickness crystal while the inhomogeneities in ce were found to appear more in crystals of thickness greater than 300 @xmath17 m @xcite .",
    "the non - zero resistivity below t@xmath7 for pressures greater than the 2.72 gpa of the t@xmath4 @xmath25 t transition can be explained based on the 88 - 98@xmath3 insulating t phase .",
    "this is consistent with the magnitude of resistivity at 4.5 gpa that is of an order of a fraction of a @xmath26 cm , while typical resistivity above t@xmath7 at normal pressure ( where the material is in t@xmath4 phase ) is a fraction of m@xmath26 cm @xcite .",

    "t@xmath7 is suppressed by pressure and at 34 gpa we can not detect any sign of superconducting transition in the resistivity data , and the shape of the resistivity versus temperature curves are consistent with an insulating behavior . at higher pressure ( 43 gpa ) ,",
    "the resistivity versus temperature curve show two broad peaks .",
    "these mysterious features are perhaps due to the complicated effect of the pressure on the magnetic ordering ( spin orientation ) @xcite , and a better understanding of this will require a careful high pressure neutron scattering study .",

    "5a ) and decompression ( fig .",
    "5b ) , with maximum pressure of 32.1 gpa .",
    "the arrow points to the t@xmath7 .",
    "the shape of susceptibility data and how t@xmath7 is determined when a double - frequency modulation technique is used have been discussed in detail in a review paper by struzhkin @xmath15 @xcite and are based on the hao - clemm theory for reversible magnetization in type ii superconductors @xcite .",
    "basically , t@xmath7 in the ac - susceptibility data for pr@xmath8ce@xmath9cuo@xmath2 is marked by the higher temperature `` end '' of the peak as shown in fig .",
    "5 . the extremely sensitive ac - susceptibility proved to be an excellent probe for detecting and monitoring the evolution of t@xmath7 versus pressure given the small fraction of the t@xmath4 superconducting phase beyond the structural transition .",
    "remarkably , for the over - doped pr@xmath8ce@xmath9cuo@xmath2 , t@xmath7 remains unaltered all the way up to 32.1 gpa .    finally , the phase diagram t@xmath7 versus pressure is drawn in fig . 6 , for both pr@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath2 and pr@xmath8ce@xmath9cuo@xmath2 . t@xmath7 for the optimally - doped pr@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath2 is given by the temperature at the peak of resistivity versus t , and t@xmath7 for the over - doped pr@xmath8ce@xmath9cuo@xmath2 from the ac - susceptibility versus t as described earlier .",
    "we also included in the superconducting phase diagram t@xmath7 versus pressure for [ 0 - 2 ] gpa as determined from resistivity measurements by crusellas @xmath15 @xcite on an optimally - doped pcco crystal .",
    "it should be noted here that the high - pressure data points of crusellas @xmath15 @xcite were obtained from data using 1:1 isoamyl and @xmath27-pentane alcohol , that is a completely different pressure medium than the neon gas used in the present study .",
    "therefore , lower pressures resistivity measurements using the same ne gas pressure media will be needed to settle if t@xmath7 is monotonically suppressed with applying pressure or if that beyond 2.7 gpa ( corresponding to the t@xmath4 @xmath25 t transition ) t@xmath7 is suppressed at a higher rate .",
    "regardless , the rate of suppression of t@xmath7 for the optimally - doped sample decreases beyond a pressure that is somewhere between 7 and 13 gpa showing a `` saturation '' to certain t@xmath7 .     versus pressure for pr@xmath5ce@xmath6cuo@xmath2 ( @xmath28 the onset of diamagnetism from @xmath29 under normal pressure , @xmath30 adapted from resistivity on crystal by crusellas @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath31 @xmath32 during compression ) and pr@xmath8ce@xmath9cuo@xmath2 ( @xmath33 @xmath29 during compression , @xmath34 @xmath29 during decompression ) .",

    "it has been known for a long time that the t - structure can be only easily hole - doped , while the t@xmath4-structure can be easily only electron - doped @xcite . in the present study , since 88 - 98@xmath3 of the normal pressure t@xmath4 phase ( that is electron - doped )",
