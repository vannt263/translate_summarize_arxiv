    "multipartite entanglement plays a prominent role in quantum error correction @xcite , one - way quantum computer @xcite and quantum secret sharing @xcite .",
    "the genuine multipartite entangled states eventhough act as great resource for various quantum information and computational tasks @xcite , they become partially entangled states or mixed states due to decoherence .",
    "these partially entangled states are also utilized in certain quantum information processes , see for example @xcite . to certify the multipartite entangled states , several entanglement identifiers in the form of inequalities",
    "@xcite have been constructed . however , for an experimental implementation , the entanglement conditions should be represented in terms of local observables @xcite .",
    "one of the widely studied experimentally accessible entanglement identifiers is the entanglement witness @xcite . recently",
    "two different tools , namely correlation tensors and covariance matrices approach , have been introduced as an alternate to the entanglement witnesses @xcite . among these two ,",
    "the correlation tensors approach got wide attention since it accounts all @xmath0-body correlations that contains all information about the entanglement of a system .",
    "however , recent results reveal that single particle information can also be used to distinguish several important classes of entanglement by associating it with a geometric object , namely entanglement polytope @xcite . with the help of correlation matrix approach several entanglement conditions for bipartite and multipartite states",
    "were reported @xcite .",
    "for example , the experimentally friendly conditions for entanglement were derived in terms of correlation function , which are stronger than the entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "later a geometric approach has been developed in order to identify the genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) and non-@xmath1-separability of different families of multipartite entangled states @xcite .",
    "vicente and huber have developed a general framework to detect gme and non - full separability in multipartite states @xcite . even though different upper bounds were derived to identify gme of @xmath2-partite and @xmath3-partite states @xcite , it is difficult to generalize them for @xmath0-number of systems @xmath4 .",
    "this observation motivates us to consider a class of multipartite entangled states and to characterize their entanglement using correlation tensors .",
    "the restriction on a class of multipartite entangled states and deriving a separability condition for that class offers an advantage to the study of non-@xmath1-separability of multipartite states .    to begin , we recall the definition of @xmath1-separability .",
    "an @xmath0-partite pure quantum state @xmath5 is @xmath1-product @xmath6 if and only if it can be written as a product of @xmath1 substates , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , represents the state of a subsystem or a group of subsystems @xcite .",
    "a mixed state @xmath10 is called @xmath1-separable , if it can be decomposed into pure @xmath1-product states , that is @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13",
    ". an @xmath0-partite state is called non-@xmath1-separable if it is not @xmath1-separable @xcite .",
    "we note here that the criterion based on two particle correlations like covariance matrix criterion is inadequate to detect the entanglement of graph states @xcite . under this circumstance , we believe that the correlation tensor approach is fruitful to characterize the graph states @xcite .",
    "graph states are pure multiqubit states , essential for quantum error correction @xcite and one - way quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the graph states and their special types such as ghz states and cluster states have been experimentally created and analysed @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to identify and quantify the entanglement of graph states @xcite .",
    "recently , entanglement witnesses were also constructed for graph states but they were limited to few qubits only @xcite .",
    "our survey on this topic reveals that the non-@xmath1-separability of graph states is yet to be formulated .    motivated by these observations , in this paper",
    ", we find standard tensor norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors for different multipartite entangled states .",
    "the norms of the @xmath0-qubit complete graph states yield a suitable upper bound for @xmath1-separable @xmath0-qubit complete graph states . using this norm",
    "we derive a separability condition that identifies the non-@xmath1-separability of a class of complete graph states .",
    "we illustrate the performance of our criterion for @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise .",
    "the criterion presented in this paper can be experimentally feasible with the help of few local observables .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we recall correlation tensors and derive the norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors for different multipartite entangled states . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we formulate a separability criterion to identify the non-@xmath1-separability of a class of complete graph states , including ghz state . in section [ sec4 ] , using our criterion , we analyze the gme and non-@xmath1-separability of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise . in section [ sec5 ] , we present our conclusion and discuss the experimental feasibility of our criterion .",
    "we present the method of finding the norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors for @xmath0-qubit complete graph states in the appendix .",
    "to begin , we recall correlation tensors . we then briefly review complete graph states and present the standard tensor norm of correlation tensors of certain genuine multipartite entangled states .",
    "the bloch representation of an @xmath0-qubit density operator is represented by @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 stands for the identity operator , @xmath16 are pauli matrices and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for our convenience , after making the tensor product in ( [ blonqdm ] ) , we redenote the coefficients @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear from the above that the correlation tensors can be represented by expectation values of all possible tensor products of pauli operators @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-body correlation tensor or full correlation tensor , denoted by @xmath22 , is defined by @xcite @xmath23 we consider the standard tensor norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors as given in @xcite , that is latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    since this norm is multiplicative under outer products , we can factorize the @xmath0-body correlation tensors into product of @xmath1 number of lower order correlation tensors as an upper bound to derive the separability criterion .      to begin , we find standard tensor norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors of certain multiqubit entangled states .",
    "we then consider complete graph states and derive a general expression for the standard norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors .",
    "we also consider ghz , w and cluster states and evaluate the standard tensor norms and compare them with the complete graph states .",
    "graph states are pure multiqubit entangled states conventionally represented by mathematical graphs @xcite . in our study , we consider only complete graph ( cg ) states in which each vertex is connected with the remaining vertices through edges .",
    "the graph state is represented by @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26 are qubits , @xmath27 is the edge between @xmath28 and @xmath26 which in turn represents the interaction of two vertices or qubits , @xmath0 is the number of vertices or qubits , @xmath29 is the single qubit state @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the controlled-@xmath32 operation between the qubits @xmath28 and @xmath26 which can be represented by the following matrix @xmath33 for instance , a @xmath2-qubit complete graph state is represented by    @xmath34 we depict the complete graph states for some vertices .",
    "now let us determine the norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors for @xmath0-qubit complete graph states .",
    "the one - body correlation tensor of a single qubit is @xmath35 .",
    "as far as the two qubit complete graph state is concerned , we have to evaluate nine two - body correlation tensors , that is @xmath36 , @xmath37 . evaluating all of them ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and substituting them into ( [ st ] ) , @xmath47",
    ", we find @xmath48 . in the case of @xmath2-qubit complete graph state",
    ", we have to evaluate @xmath49 correlation tensors @xmath50 , @xmath51 . evaluating all of them and substituting the resultant values into ( [ st ] )",
    ", we find the standard tensor norm of @xmath2-body correlation tensors is @xmath52 . for the @xmath0-qubit complete graph states we have to determine @xmath53 correlation tensors from which we can fix the standard tensor norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors .",
    "in the case of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states , we observe that most of the correlation tensors become zero and in the remaining cases each correlation tensor produces the value one . from this outcome",
    "we identify the non - zero expectation value of tensor product of pauli matrices for @xmath0-qubit complete graph states . the standard tensor norm of non - zero correlation tensors reads    @xmath54    [ stnopercg ]    for odd and even @xmath0 respectively . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes the sum over all possible permutations .",
    "the operators given in ( [ stnopercg ] ) and their possible permutations provide non - zero expectation value for the @xmath0-qubit complete graph states . by counting the number of permutations , we can derive a general expression for the norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states .",
    "since each expectation value is one , the resultant value can be expressed in the form @xmath56 @xmath57 , if @xmath0 is odd ( even ) .",
    "we demonstrate the equivalence of ( [ stnopercg ] ) and ( [ stng ] ) in the appendix .",
    "it is known that ghz state is locally equivalent to the complete graph state @xcite .",
    "the standard tensor norm of correlation tensors of @xmath0-qubit ghz state , @xmath58 @xcite , matches with the expression given in ( [ stng ] ) .",
    "but in this case , the non - zero correlation tensors are found to be    @xmath59    which are different from eq.([stnopercg ] ) .",
    "in similar manner we can also determine the standard tensor norm of correlation tensors of @xmath0-qubit w states @xmath60 @xmath61 @xcite and cluster states @xmath62   with @xmath63 @xcite for several @xmath0 .",
    "the results are given in table [ stnctmes ] .",
    ".standard tensor norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors for multipartite entangled states [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we study the robustness of our criterion against noise . to study the noise robustness of our separability criterion , one may consider a state mixed with white noise ( identity operator ) , see for example ref . @xcite . since the correlation tensor elements vanish for the identity operator , adding white noise with a complete graph state is not a meaningful one .",
    "therefore we add a colored product noise and identify the gme and non-@xmath1-separability of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states mixed with colored product noise @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath0-qubit complete graph state ( [ graph ] ) and @xmath66 @xmath67 is the probability .",
    "we note here that the state ( [ rhogcpn ] ) is in the form to which our criterion can be verified unambiguously .    enforcing the condition ( [ bicond ] ) on @xmath68 , we find @xmath69 when the state @xmath68 obeys the inequality @xmath70 , then the state is genuinely @xmath0-qubit entangled .",
    "to demonstrate this , we plot the function @xmath71 against the probability @xmath66 @xmath67 for various values of @xmath0 in fig . [ 9qugm ] . in this figure",
    ", the range covered by @xmath70 reveals the genuine @xmath0-qubit entanglement .",
    "we also analyze the genuine @xmath0-qubit entanglement for large @xmath0 values of @xmath68 . in this case",
    "our criterion identifies the genuine @xmath0-qubit entanglement approximately in the range of @xmath72 .    to illustrate the non-@xmath1-separability",
    ", we consider @xmath73 in ( [ rhogcpn ] ) .",
    "we then find an upper bound for various @xmath1-separable @xmath74 and @xmath75 6-qubit state , that is @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively . applying the inequality ( [ cond ] ) on the @xmath81-qubit complete graph state added with colored product noise",
    ", we find @xmath82 the case , @xmath83 confirms the non-@xmath1-separability . the outcome is drawn in fig . [ 9quns ] .",
    "we have also analysed the non - full separability of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise .",
    "the non - full separability of @xmath68 can be obtained from the expression @xmath84    let us consider the @xmath0-qubit ghz states mixed with colored product noise @xmath85 where @xmath86 . enforcing the condition ( [ cond ] ) on @xmath87 , we obtain a function that matches with ( [ kscond ] ) and ( [ 6qksepub ] ) .",
    "this in turn confirms that our criterion can also detect non-@xmath1-separability in @xmath0-qubit complete graph states mixed with colored product noise and @xmath0-qubit ghz state mixed with colored product noise in the same parameter range .",
    "we have proposed a sufficient condition to identify the non-@xmath1-separability of a class of mixed @xmath0-qubit complete graph states using correlation tensors .",
    "our criterion performs well in identifying gme and non-@xmath1-separability of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise .",
    "we have confirmed that our criterion also provides the same parameter range while detecting non-@xmath1-separability of the @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise and @xmath0-qubit ghz states added with colored product noise .",
    "we recall here that suppose a separability criterion is derived for arbitrary states , one can use that criterion for any states without prior information . if it is not the case , one should have theoretical expectations of what the state should look like . in the latter case",
    "one should choose a suitable criterion which can detect the state under consideration @xcite .",
    "since our criterion is applicable when there is a promise that the state is a complete graph state ( or a mixture of these ) , one should have theoretical expectations about complete graph states . to evaluate the standard tensor norm of our criterion one needs to measure totally @xmath53 correlation tensors for @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "since a considerable number of expectation values of local observables become zero @xcite , one essentially performs the measurements corresponding to non - vanishing expectation values only . for example , in the case of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states added with colored product noise , it is enough to measure only @xmath88 ( if @xmath0 is odd @xmath89 , otherwise @xmath90 ) correlation tensors out of @xmath53 correlation tensors .",
    "in which , @xmath91 number of observables are given in equation ( [ stnopercg ] ) and the other observable is @xmath92 .",
    "therefore @xmath88 number of local observables are sufficient to identify the non-@xmath1-separability of ( [ rhogcpn ] ) through our criterion .",
    "+ we thank the referee for his / her valuable suggestions to improve the quality of this paper .",
    "both the authors have contributed equally to the research and to the writing up of the paper .",
    "to derive a general expression for the standard norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states , we consider eq.([stnopercg ] ) . for a given @xmath0",
    ", we expand the expression ( [ stnopercg ] ) and find all possible permutations .",
    "since each expectation value is one for @xmath0-qubit complete graph states , we just count the number of expectation values , which in turn provide the norm of @xmath0-body correlation tensors of @xmath0-qubit complete graph states . in this way we obtain the expression ( [ stng ] ) .      substituting @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ stnopercg2 ] ) , it becomes @xmath94 upon expanding the right hand side , we obtain @xmath95 the total number of permutations of @xmath28 and @xmath26 in @xmath96 are @xmath97 . using this in eq.([appeven1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath98 simplifying the right hand side , we find @xmath99 one can obtain the same value from @xmath100 while substituting @xmath93 and @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , for the case @xmath101 , eq . ( [ stnopercg1 ] ) yields @xmath102 in this case , we find @xmath103 evaluating the right hand side , we obtain @xmath104 , which in turn exactly coincides with the one given in ( [ stng ] ) .",
