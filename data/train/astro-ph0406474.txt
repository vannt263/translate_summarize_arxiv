    "in order to detect ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , atmospheric fluorescence light from the trajectory of the extensive air shower may be measured by mirror - photosensor systems ( the fluorescence technique ) . in this type of experiment ,",
    "the photon yield from electrons exciting air of various densities and temperatures is the most fundamental information for estimating the primary energy of uhecr .",
    "we have reported in our previous paper @xcite that the photon yield between 300 nm and 406 nm in air excited by an electron with a mean kinetic energy of 0.85 mev ( @xmath0 ) is 3.73@xmath10.15(@xmath114% systematics ) photons per meter at 1000 hpa and 20@xmath2c .",
    "we measured it with six narrow band interference filters , whose central wave lengths were 314.7 , 337.7 , 356.3 , 380.9 , 391.9 and 400.9 nm .",
    "the bandwidth of each filter at 50% of the peak transmission was about 10 nm .",
    "we estimated the photons in unmeasured wave band to be 8.8% with help from the values reported by bunner @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the photon yields in the 337 and 358 nm bands are proportional to d@xmath3/d@xmath4 , when we compare our measurements with the photon yields measured at 300@xmath51000mev by kakimoto et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have made the new measurements with additional 9 filters and have improved the photon yields reported before . by comparing the measurements with filters of overlapping wavelength , the contamination of bands in the tail of each filter is estimated and corrected . in this report we provide the photon yields between 300 nm and 430 nm from our own measurements .",
    "the air density and temperature dependences of each wave band , and the average values in the radiative transition from the level @xmath6 to the level @xmath7 in the first negative 1n(0 , @xmath7 ) , and in the second positive 2p(0 , @xmath7 ) , 2p(1 , @xmath7 ) and 2p(2 , @xmath7 ) systems , are given for application to uhecr observations .    in our previous report @xcite , we have shown the pressure dependence of the relaxation rate of the excited level of n@xmath8 and n@xmath9 in nitrogen gas and in air .",
    "the radiative lifetimes @xmath10 have been obtained after determining the reference pressure @xmath11 from the pressure dependence of the photon yields ( see eqs.(5 ) and ( 10 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the definitions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 will be given in section 3 .",
    "since there have been many experiments ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) before the 1970s that measure @xmath10 with accuracy much better than ours , we do nt include our present measurements of @xmath10 in this article .",
    "[ thb ]        we chose a photon counting and thin target technique to measure the pressure dependence of photon yields ( the number of photons produced by electrons per meter of travel ) from nitrogen and air excited by electrons , following the method employed by kakimoto et al .",
    "experimental details are described in our previous report@xcite .",
    "the central values of the new filters used in the present measurement are 325.0 , 330.6 , 350.2 , 372.5 , 410.0 , 414.0 , 418.5 and 430.0 nm , and their bandwidths at half maximum are about 10 nm . a measurement at 392.0 nm with a band width of 4.35 nm is also made .",
    "their transmissions are indicated by dashed curves in fig.[filter ] .",
    "the solid curves are transmissions of the filters used in the previous measurement @xcite . by subtracting the contribution of bands in the tail of the transmission curves ,",
    "the photon yields from 15 bands between 300 and 430 nm are determined .",
    "contributions from the 311.7 , 313.6 , 330.9 , 333.9 , 346.9 , 350.0 , 358.2 , 367.2 , 371.1 , 388.4 and 389.4 nm bands ca nt be separated and are included in other bands .",
    "the systematic errors of the present experiment are discussed in @xcite . although the uncertainty from the contamination of lines in the tails of filter transmissions is reduced from 5% to 2% , the total systematic error is only reduced from 13.8% to 13% .",
    "this is because the main systematic errors are from uncertainties in the collection efficiency and quantum efficiency of the photomultiplier tubes used in the present experiment .",
    "as described in bunner @xcite and in our previous report @xcite , the photon yield @xmath12 per unit length from gas excited by an electron is written as a function of pressure @xmath13 at a constant temperature @xmath14 in kelvin : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the specific gas constant ( n@xmath8 : 296.9 m@xmath17s@xmath18k@xmath19 and air : 287.1 m@xmath17s@xmath18k@xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the energy loss in ev kg@xmath19 m@xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the photon energy ( ev ) .",

    "it should be noted that since @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath39 , then @xmath11 at @xmath14 , @xmath40 , may be expressed by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is @xmath11 at 20@xmath2c .",
    "the photon yield per unit length per electron @xmath12 is determined as the number of signal counts @xmath43 divided by the product of the following : the total number of electrons @xmath44 , the length of the fluorescence portion @xmath45 , the solid angle of the pmt @xmath46 , the quartz window transmission @xmath47 , the filter transmission @xmath48 , and the quantum efficiency qe and the collection efficiency ce of the pmt .",
    "@xmath49    in the following analysis we use a value of @xmath48 appropriate for the main nitrogen emission band in each filter band pass .",
    "the number of photons from another band in a given filter is estimated from measurements in two adjacent filters and is subtracted from the observed photons .",
    "@xmath44 is about @xmath50 from about 80 hours in each run .",
    "finally , @xmath12 from a run in a vacuum is subtracted from each @xmath12 determined above and the corrected @xmath12 is determined .      in order to separate the photons from the 1n band system ( 427.8 nm ) and the 2p band system ( 427.0 nm ) , a `` two components '' analysis has been performed in one filter band .",
    "the method is described in detail in our previous report @xcite .",
    "briefly , we have fitted the observed pressure dependence of @xmath51 with a superposition of two bands in one filter by the least square(ls ) method . in this case",
    "the observed photon yield @xmath51 is the sum of the photon yields of the main band @xmath52 and the sub - band @xmath53 , and is written as follows :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the parameters of the main band in the filter , and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are those of the other band .",
