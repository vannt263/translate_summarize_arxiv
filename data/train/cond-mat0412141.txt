    "has to write analytical approximations to the size spectrum and then to variate parameters of these approximations .",
    "the most traditional way to get analytical approximations is the iteration procedure . originally started by kuni @xcite it was seriously modified in @xcite , @xcite and became a powerful tool to describe nucleation kinetics .",
    "but here one can not use iteration procedure due to the following reasons :    * the simplest effect which can cause the difference @xmath8 from @xmath10 is the influence of stochastic deviation of the rate of formation from the mean value on the rate of formation of droplets in next moments of time . *",
    "the first iteration in the iteration procedure corresponds to the ideal rate of growth .",
    "so , there is no influence of the deviation of the rate of formation of droplets of big sizes on formation of new droplets . *",
    "the second iteration can not be calculated analytically .",
    "* the standard approximations @xcite which allow to calculate further iterations correspond to some model approximation to the size spectrum . in these approximations",
    "one can not effectively calculate the influence of stochastic deviation of the rate of formation from the mean value on the rate of formation of droplets in next moments of time .",
    "the mentioned difficulties is the reason to calculate stochastic effects on the base of some simple models of evolution .    to present the models for",
    "the size spectrum one has choose a renormalization in the corresponding theory based on averaged characteristics :    * the evolution equation for the renormalized number of molecules @xmath13 in a new phase looks like @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the size spectrum .",
    "* the characteristic time @xmath16 necessary for decompositions ( see @xcite , @xcite ) is chosen to get at @xmath17 the maximum if the spectrum ( or the maximum of spectrum in the first iteration ) .",
    "it leads to @xmath18    the manifestation of stochastic effects requires to have at least two effects - the effect of stochastic deviations and the effect of further reaction on these deviations .",
    "so , the simplest model is the two cycle model where during the first cycle the independent stochastic deviations appear and during the second cycle the reaction on these deviation takes place .",
    "the `` minimal '' model is the two cycle model and now we shall investigate this model .    at first we shall consider approximation proposed in @xcite .",
    "the approximation is the following one    * before @xmath19 the rate of nucleation is supposed to be the ideal one . * after @xmath20 the rate of nucleation @xmath21 ( in renormalized units ) is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the renormalized number of molecules in the droplets formed before @xmath24    in the theory based on the averaged characteristics @xmath25 which explains the sense of approximation .",
    "it is clear that this approximation is very rough .",
    "the boundary parameter @xmath26 was chosen in a bad style .",
    "the reasons of such conclusion are the following :    \\1 .",
    "the spectrum has very discontinuous character .",
    "the jump at @xmath26 is very big .",
    "it can be seen in fig.1         the form of approximation with a boundary value @xmath27    we see that the region @xmath28 is approximately negligible in the calculation of total number of droplets .",
    "but namely this tail will be the main source of the deviation of dispersion from the standard value .    \\2 . for arbitrary @xmath29",
    "one can calculate the number @xmath30 of the total number of droplets .",
    "but always we get the number which is greater than the precise value @xmath31 .",
    "the figure 2 shows the number of droplets as function of @xmath29 .         the total number of droplets given by the theory based on averaged characteristics as a function of @xmath29    one can see that the number of droplets has minimum at @xmath32 .",
    "this value seems to be more realistic because the jump in the spectrum ( this jump must be in every model of such a type ) is nt so giant .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the form of spectrum approximation with a boundary value @xmath32 .",
    "the models with two cycles of evolution where the first cycle is an ideal one and the second cycle is formed under the influence of the first cycle will be referred to as `` two cycle models '' .",
    "the models where the spectrum in the first cycle is determined explicitly on the base of ideal conditions of the embryos formation will be called `` explicit two cycle models '' .    from figure 2 one can see that explicit two cycle models can not reproduce the right number of droplets .",
    "but these models have still more bad features concerning with calculation of dispersion .",
    "the best way to check the theoretical calculation of dispersion in the presented model is to compare it with the results of numerical simulation . here",
    "the following type of numerical simulation will be presented : the evolution of the system of the volume @xmath4 starts from big negative @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is sufficient ) and at every step @xmath35 the random number between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is generated @xmath4 times .",
    "every time the generated random number is compared with @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the rate of nucleation in tac and can be calculated as @xmath40 to know @xmath13 one has to know four integrals @xmath41 and @xmath13 is determined as @xmath42 the integrals @xmath43 are determined in tac as @xmath44 in application to the random appearance of embryos it means that at every attempt when the random number is greater than @xmath38 the integrals have to be increased as @xmath45 certainly , at every step @xmath33 moves to @xmath46 .    in the current calculations the step is @xmath47 , at every @xmath4 around @xmath48 nucleation processes were performed and then the mean value and dispersion were calculated .    the interesting value is the ratio @xmath49 which is plotted in figure 4 . since there is no evidence what total number of droplets one has to take in calculation of @xmath10 ( there are two variants @xmath50 and @xmath51 )",
    "two curves are presented . since @xmath1 is very close to @xmath30",
    "these curves are close .",
    "the jumps of curves correspond to stochastic nature of calculations and one can see what characteristic error is caused by averaging only over 1000 attempts .",
    "relative square of dispersion as the function of the volume in precise simulation .",
    "one can see that the value of dispersion goes with increase of @xmath4 to a limit value around @xmath52 rather quickly .",
    "really in a volume unit there will be around @xmath53 droplets .",
    "so , at @xmath54 droplets the limit value is already attained .",
    "now one can turn to the analytical calculations of dispersion . at first",
    "we shall present calculation according to formulas presented in @xcite .",
    "since the approach in @xcite is absolutely analogous to approach @xcite we do nt mention all mistakes made in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "they are mentioned in @xcite , @xcite where these mistakes were corrected .",
    "the result of calculation is shown in figure 5 . instead of @xcite ,",
    "@xcite we consider the model with an arbitrary @xmath26 instead of @xmath55 . here",
    "one can see the relative square of dispersion as function of @xmath29 .",
    "we plot the parameter @xmath56 in the gaussian distribution @xmath57         relative square of dispersion as function of @xmath29    we see that the dependence of dispersion on @xmath29 is rather essential and there is no evidence of the choice of @xmath29 .",
    "it is seen that the result of the model with @xmath58 is two times smaller than a real result .",
    "but the `` optimal choice '' @xmath59 gives the value of dispersion which is rather close to the real result .",
    "it seems that here the coincidence is attained . but",
    "further considerations will show that this coincidence in no more than occasional .",
    "having seen the results of two cycle models one has to mention that the calculation in these models is connected with technical difficulties and requires serious simplifications to come to the final result . beside many unnecessary restrictions ( see @xcite , @xcite ) the linearization of the action of stochastic fluctuations of already appeared droplets on the rate of formation of new droplets has been done . this linearization is necessary to perform analytical calculations but it kills all possible deviations of the mean number of droplets from the value calculated in the theory based on averaged characteristics .",
    "so , the conclusion about the absence of this shift made in @xcite , @xcite is out of justification , it is direct consequence of linearization . a special question why there is no shift in the mean number of droplets will be the matter of further analysis and now the dispersion with all non - linear terms of the two cycle model will be calculated .",
    "the most simple and effective way to see the non - linear corrections in the two cycle model is to fulfill the numerical simulation corresponding to this model .",
    "then one has to change the calculation of @xmath39 .",
    "instead of @xmath60 one has to use @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath62 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is calculated analogously to @xmath13 but the values of @xmath43 have to be taken here at @xmath26 ( no further increase is allowed ) .",
    "so , from the first point of view there are absolutely no difficulties in simulation of this model .",
    "the numerical simulation of explicit two cycle model shows new weak features of this model .",
    "the first principal difficulty is the divergence of the model .",
    "really , there is a fixed small probability that until @xmath24 no droplets at all will be formed .",
    "this probability can be taken from gaussian distribution as @xmath64 but here there is no reasons to take the gaussian distribution valid for many events ( here there are no events ) .",
    "it is more reasonable to take poisson distribution but even with this distribution one has to come to @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the number of possible events until @xmath26 . for @xmath66 one can get @xmath67 so , with a fixed probability ( it is very small ) there will be no droplets until @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath68 and the size spectrum @xmath69 grows infinitely .    as a result",
    "we see that in explicit two cycle models there appears a singularity which is certainly a main peak in integration over all possible situations .",
    "so , it completely destroys the possibility to get reasonable results in the two cycle models .    to overcome this difficulty one has to see what happens when the number of droplets @xmath70 appeared before @xmath26 deviates from the mean value @xmath71 . since the problem is formulated on the level of the number of droplets . ]",
    "it will be very profitable to express evolution in terms of the number of droplets .",
    "fortunately it is possible to do . in @xcite",
    "a monodisperse approximation for the evolution in the theory based on the averaged characteristics has been presented for the situation of the metastable phase decay . in @xcite",
    "the same task was solved for the smooth variation of external conditions .",
    "now we shall use results of @xcite for our purposes .    briefly speaking",
    "one can say that according to results of @xcite during the nucleation period the vapor is consumed in the unit volume by @xmath72 droplets and this value in renormalized values is one and the same .    what will happened when at @xmath73 ( this is the average value for the position of formation of the maximum of droplets ) the number of appeared droplets will be less than @xmath74 ?",
    "the system will wait until the moment when there will be @xmath74 droplets in the unit of volume .",
    "it will occur at some moment later than @xmath73 , i.e. at @xmath75 .",
    "later the evolution will be the same but in the shifted @xmath76 .",
    "we see that if we calculate the number of droplets precisely at @xmath24 then the parameter in a functional approximation for the rest of size spectrum will be smaller or greater than the necessary value . in the monodisperse approximation",
    "this functional approximation is @xmath77 in explicit two cycle boundary it is @xmath78 when we put the smaller @xmath79 than @xmath74 then the validity of approximation will be violated .",
    "one simply can not use approximation when the value of parameter seriously differs from the value @xmath74 .",
    "the same is valid also for approximation ( [ pp ] ) .",
    "approximation ( [ pp ] ) can be used only if all @xmath43 are near @xmath80 . the use of ( [ pp ] ) for all deviations ( also corresponding to the small values if @xmath43 ) is the serious mistake .",
    "namely this mistake does nt allow to use the two cycle models with a fixed boundaries .    to formulate the two cycle models with floating boundary one has to formulate the balancing property of the kinetics of nucleation .",
    "the calculations of stochastic effects are so complex that they can be made only in some primitive models of evolution in frames of mean values of characteristics .",
    "so , we have to present simple and rather precise models of evolution .    at",
    "first we consider the situation of decay .",
    "in the situation of decay there are two sources of balancing force .",
    "the first one is evident .",
    "suppose that imaginary the whole period is divided into two arbitrary parts .",
    "let the number of droplets in the first part be greater that the average value .",
    "then these droplets will consume metastable phase with greater intensity and the second part of nucleation will be shorter",
    ". then the supposed number of droplets born in the second part will be smaller .",
    "this balances the number of droplets near the average value .",
    "the second balancing reason is more specific .",
    "suppose that the first droplet is nt going to appear .",
    "what will be changed in kinetics ?",
    "the start of nucleation process is the moment of appearance of the first droplet and the system will simply wait until this moment without any changes .",
    "the process of nucleation is invariant to the starting point which is the appearance of the first droplet .",
    "denote as @xmath81 the moment of appearance of the first droplet .",
    "then @xmath82 in the situation of decay .",
    "consider now the situation of smooth variation of external conditions . to get the analytic approximations one has to choose some model of kinetics .",
    "the model of monodisperse spectrum is rather simple and precise @xcite .",
    "we shall follow this model .",
    "certainly the first reason of balancing effect takes place also in dynamic conditions .",
    "but the second reason does nt take place .",
    "the problem is that there is no fixed initial point such as @xmath81 in decay .",
    "ordinary the coordinate of monodisperse spectrum is . ]",
    "we shall call this coordinate @xmath83 .",
    "then the distribution function has the form @xmath84 where the effective number of droplets @xmath70 is given by @xmath85 or @xmath86    the value @xmath70 has the gaussian distribution @xmath87 where @xmath71 is the mean value .",
    "consider what will happen when at @xmath73 the required number of droplets @xmath70 will be less than @xmath71 .",
    "the system will simply wait until @xmath71 will be attained .",
    "and then the evolution will be absolutely the same .",
    "but the evolution will occur with a shifted value of argument @xmath33 which corresponds to the shift in the amplitude value @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the shift in @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the coefficient , which can be put to @xmath37 by appropriate scale of variables @xmath92 .",
    "we keep here @xmath91 to show that the effects do nt occur due to the special renormalization .",
    "then the mean total number of droplets @xmath93 will be shifted as @xmath94    our task is to obtain the shift @xmath89 or the distribution of shifts @xmath95 .",
    "this distribution is connected with @xmath96 .",
    "one can present @xmath71 as @xmath97 or approximately @xmath98 then @xmath99    then @xmath100 or @xmath101 one can also write the last relation as @xmath102    then one can speak about the density distribution @xmath103 of the total number of droplets because @xmath104 then @xmath105    this leads to @xmath106 and there is no effect of shift .",
    "the distribution of the total number of droplets is a gaussian distribution with the ordinary mean value .",
    "the last relation leads to to the absence of shift effect also in the case of dynamic conditions .",
    "certainly , one can mention that the absence of shift takes place only approximately .",
    "really , having used in ( [ tyt ] ) the same parameter @xmath91 we supposed that the difference between ideal supersaturation and real supersaturation is absent .",
    "but the difference is nt absent , it is only small .",
    "then instead of ( [ tyt ] ) we come to @xmath107 the sense of parameters is explained in @xcite . for us",
    "now it is only important that at @xmath108 the coefficient @xmath91 will be approximately @xmath109 then @xmath110 or @xmath111    because @xmath112 is very small one can not see this effect clearly in experiment or in comparison with numerical simulation .",
    "in fact the existence of the last effect is rather doubtful and it is more preferable to speak about the absence of of the regular shift in the considered situation .",
    "one has to note that the property of the absence of the regular shift is very important in the context of stability of kinetics .",
    "really all proposed models have to demonstrate the property of stability in respect to the stochastic perturbations .",
    "namely the absence of the regular shift ensures this stability .",
    "one can also see that the property of regular shift will take place in all two - stage models .",
    "the two stage models of evolution are the models where the first part of spectrum is formed under the ideal supersaturation ( it can be the monodisperse peak or explicitly the spectrum like @xmath113 ) and the rest part of spectrum is formed only under the external influence and the influence of droplets from the first part of the size spectrum . in details",
    "this property will be analyzed separately .",
    "the direct result of the previous balance property is the absence of correction terms to the mean number of droplets formed under the dynamic conditions .",
    "so , the problem to determine the mean number of droplets is solved .",
    "but dispersion remains still undetermined .",
    "but now one can formulate the true two cycle models .",
    "they must be the models with a floating boundary .",
    "the floating boundary is defined as a coordinate or the time moment @xmath114 when the parameters of approximation concerning the first cycle attain their values used in approximation in tac . in the monodisperse approximation",
    "there will be no difficulties - parameter @xmath115 in every particular attempt is the coordinate when the number of appeared droplets attains @xmath74 .",
    "now we shall perform simulations for explicit two cycle models with boundaries @xmath55 and @xmath116 .",
    "results are shown in figure 6 and figure 7 .",
    "relative square of dispersion as a function of volume in the explicit two cycle model with a floating boundary @xmath58 .",
    "relative square of dispersion as a function of volume in the explicit two cycle model with a floating boundary @xmath59 .",
    "one can see that the result of the model with @xmath117 is satisfactory but there are absolutely no reasons to choose @xmath55 except historical ones @xcite .",
    "the coincidence is occasional .",
    "the most reasonable model with @xmath118 gives a wrong result .",
    "in explicit two cycle models there will be a problem because different @xmath41 can attain necessary values @xmath119 in different moments .",
    "this is an evident disadvantage of explicit two cycle models .",
    "having noticed the weak features of explicit two cycle models mentioned at the beginning , we see that one has to consider the monodisperse model with the floating boundary .",
    "the model is the following :    * the effective number of droplets is @xmath120 ( the number @xmath121 appears from @xmath122 in the evolution equation in tac ) .",
    "* since the spectrum is formed in an internal point of a nucleation period one has some reasons to suppose that the subintegral function for @xmath13 in a current moment of time is rather symmetrical being related to the maximum . then the number of droplets which has to be formed before maximum has to be taken as @xmath123 . *",
    "the moment @xmath114 of the monodisperse peak appearance is characterized by formation of @xmath123 droplets . * after @xmath114 the spectrum is @xmath124    the numerical simulation requires to specify the procedure of calculation :    * until @xmath125 the function @xmath39 is @xmath113 and stochastic appearance of droplets is initiated . *",
    "when for the first time @xmath126 the coordinate @xmath33 is referred we choose @xmath114 as coordinate when @xmath127 attains @xmath79 then the result of numerical simulation of this model differs from result of numerical simulation of the precise model . ] as @xmath114 . * in further evolution @xmath128 where @xmath129    dispersion in this model is shown in figure 8 .",
    "relative square of dispersion as the function of volume of the system in the monodisperse approach .",
    "one can see that the coincidence between precise simulation and simulation in monodisperse model is satisfactory .",
    "this approximation contains the precise number of effective droplets which does nt precisely coincide with @xmath74 .",
    "so , here the number of effective droplets is nt the absolutely constant value prescribed by analytical recipes .",
    "but it is better to follow this procedure than to threw out the fractional part of the number of droplets at @xmath115 .",
    "then even the number of droplets has the characteristic jumps at the values of volume @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is a natural number .",
    "these jumps a rather essential at moderate volumes .",
    "it is evident that dispersion near these values has to be greater than the ordinary value .",
    "the last model allows very simple calculations to get the dispersion of the total number of droplets .",
    "really , the dispersion of the first part of droplets , i.e. the droplets which are in the monodisperse peak is zero @xmath132 since the floating boundary has to be used .",
    "the monodisperse spectrum absolutely governs further evolution .",
    "it is very easy to calculate the dispersion of external influence on further evolution , . really according to balance property and the self similarity of conditions of nucleation during the nucleation period ( see @xcite ) the relative deviation of the number of rest droplets equals to the ideal dispersion of the distribution of independent @xmath133 droplets , i.e. @xmath134 * < n_{rest}>\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the number of remaining droplets @xmath136 certainly one has to take into account that under the fluctuating conditions the droplets are formed stochastically with internal fluctuation characteristic to the independent formation of @xmath137 droplets @xmath138 then @xmath139    having put @xmath140 , @xmath141 one can come to @xmath142 @xmath143 the last value is nt too far from results of simulation .",
    "if one shall take into account the similarity of conditions of nucleation @xcite then it will be reasonable to put @xmath144 ( the total number of droplets ) and then @xmath145 which is practically the same result as in numerical simulations .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it can be used as the base for further more detailed constructions taking into account some fine features of nucleation kinetics .",
    "the effect of the influence of several first droplets on the deviation of the mean value of the droplets number from the value prescribed by the theory based on the averaged characteristics manifests itself in the fact that corrections to the mean value of the number of droplets can be completely explained by formation of several first ( actually the very first one ) droplets . here",
    "such a radical result does not take place , but for a wide range of volumes of systems one can effectively use the explicit role of several first droplets .    since several first droplets ( at least those in the monodisperse peak )",
    "are formed independently , the partial distribution of @xmath131 droplets is the poisson s distribution @xmath146 here @xmath66 is the number of possible events .",
    "then at the initial period @xmath147 and @xmath148 it leads to @xmath149    certainly , the main influence appears due to the first droplet . the partial distribution for the waiting of the first droplet is @xmath150 and it is similar to the universal distribution observed in @xcite .",
    "the values of dispersions at moderate @xmath4 initiated by the first droplet , by two first droplets and by three first droplets are shown in the figure 9 .",
    "the increase of the number of droplets taken into account corresponds to the increase of dispersion - the lowest curve corresponds to account of only the first droplet , the highest curve corresponds to three droplets taken into account . here",
    "the value of @xmath151 referred to the number of droplets prescribed by the theory based on averaged characteristics is drawn .",
    "relative square of dispersion as the function of volume initiated by several first droplets .",
    "it is seen that the increase in @xmath151 initiated by every new curve is rather small and one can state that the main influence is initiated by the first droplet .",
    "one can see that the account only of three first droplets ensures the correct description of the monodisperse peak for situations where @xmath152 .",
    "it corresponds to the volume @xmath153 which is already sufficient for majority of real practical situation where the stochastic effects can be really observed in practice .",
    "the method proposed above is based on monodisperse approximation .",
    "this approximation is necessary because it allows to close the system of evolution equations on a level of the number of droplets .",
    "the use of explicit models with more complicated forms of spectrum used in the expression for the quantity of new liquid phase in corresponding tac requires to write more complicated equations for other stochastic characteristics of these spectrums , which makes the problem rather more complex .",
    "meanwhile the applicability of the monodispece approximation is based on the sharpness of subintegral function in expression for the quantity of new phase . in the free molecular regime of growth",
    "this function looks like @xmath154 in tac and allows the monodisperse approximation . in the diffusion regime of growth",
    "the subintegral function in tac will be like @xmath155 and can not be approximated by a monodeisperce peak so effectively as in the case of a free molecular regime of growth .",
    "so , there appeared some difficulties but even in this situation the predictions of monodisperse model qualitatively coincides with results of numerical simulation .",
    "in the diffusion regime of growth one has to put the position of monodisperse peak at @xmath156 and then the value of necessary droplets in the monodisperse peak will be @xmath157 which is approximately the same as the total precise number of droplets in tac @xmath158",
    ". then the total number of droplets appeared in monodisperse approximation will be @xmath159 .",
    "here @xmath160 was calculated by the following way : at @xmath156 the number of droplets will be the half of @xmath70 and later the number of droplets is calculated as @xmath161    as the result we see that @xmath162 it means that practically all droplets have to be in monodisperse approximation . the consequence of this is the absence of dispersion .",
    "but the property that all droplets are in monodisperse peak means that all of them at the same time govern their evolution .",
    "so , then one can attribute the dispersion of independent events",
    ". then @xmath163 results of simulation give @xmath164 which corresponds to above predictions .",
    "now we shall refine the model .",
    "now at @xmath156 the monodisperse peak is formed and we calculate the number of droplets explicitly @xmath165 then the rest quantity of droplets is calculated by the previous formula .",
    "the result of solution is that approximately the three quarters of droplets have to be included in monodisperse peak and the rest quarter is formed under the influence of this peak .",
    "the following question appears : shall one takes into account the dispersion of droplets in the peak ?",
    "the previous result which shows the self action of the monodisperse peak onto itself requires to take into account the dispersion of the monodisperse peak .",
    "so we have @xmath166 where @xmath167 is dispersion of initial peak . certainly , for @xmath167 one has to take the dispersion of independent events @xmath10 . in the last term @xmath168",
    "the value @xmath37 comes from the self dispersion of free events and term @xmath169 is the induced dispersion .",
    "earlier in investigation of free - molecular regime there was no use to take into account the dispersion of initial peak because it would give addition only @xmath170 .",
    "this addition is so small in comparison with renormalizing factor @xmath171 appeared earlier that there is no need to take it into account . in diffusion regime",
    "such addition can be essential .",
    "this result is the estimate from above because the substitution @xmath173 increases the result .",
    "the first estimate @xmath174 is the estimate from below .",
    "so , @xmath175 the interval ensured by these estimates is rather narrow and the result of simulation lies in this interval .",
    "one has to mention that in the diffusion regime foundations of the monodisperse model and of all further constructions are rather weak .",
    "so , one can not state that our result is nt well justified .",
    "fortunately , in the diffusion regime of growth kinetics of nucleation is analyzed separately @xcite and has absolutely another physical reasons of evolution .",
    "also one has to take into account the effect of compensation due to the growing volumes considered in @xcite ."

    "<S> the number @xmath0 differs from the mean value @xmath1 averaged over many particular attempts of nucleation in the given system . </S>",
    "<S> since the process of condensation is essentially non linear one the mean value @xmath1 which is a result of averaging of particular processes differs from the value @xmath2 calculated in the theory based on averaged characteristics ( tac ) @xcite . in a free molecular regime of droplets growth considered here the number @xmath1 approaches to the value calculated on the base of averaged characteristics @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it occurs when the volume @xmath4 of the system is infinitely big which explains notation @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> one has to take this property into account in all theoretical descriptions of kinetics of the global process of phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier stochastic effects were investigated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but here it will be shown that the consideration made in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is nt satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> still the structure of analysis proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite can be adopted in general features for further considerations . from the general limit theorem for the chain of stochastic events </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the distribution @xmath6 has to be a gaussian distribution with some mean value @xmath1 and dispersion @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the task is to determine these values .    from the first point of view </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 equals to the value @xmath9 of dispersion of distribution of independent events . </S>",
    "<S> but the nonlinearity of kinetics of the nucleation process leads to the deviation of @xmath8 from @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> namely this deviation will be the subject of investigation in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> here the situation of the smooth variation of external conditions will be studied . </S>",
    "<S> namely in this situation the method proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite leads to the most striking error .    </S>",
    "<S> the plan of investigation will be the following    * in the first part we shall see why the previous publications @xcite , @xcite , @xcite can not be applied , what are the errors made in these publications . </S>",
    "<S> * in the second part a method to determine dispersion will be presented . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on the monodisperse approximation proposed in @xcite . to calculate dispersion one has to take into account the specific internal balance property in the nucleation process . as a result </S>",
    "<S> a very simple method to calculate dispersion is given . </S>",
    "<S> * in the third part the role of the several first droplets in formation of dispersion is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> the result of this section is a simple method with clear physical reasons which can be applied for practically all significant relative deviations of @xmath11 from @xmath12 . </S>"
