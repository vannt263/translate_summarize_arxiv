    "the last year has seen the discovery of non - zero @xmath2 , and neutrino physics research entered a next stage .",
    "next generation experiments will be targeting the leptonic cp violation and the mass hierarchy of the neutrino . to achieve this goal , it is essential to understand the neutrino - nucleus interaction more precisely , 10% or even better , over a rather wide kinematical region that covers quasi - elastic , resonance , and deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) regions .    in this contribution , we are concerned with the resonance region , from the @xmath3 through second and third resonance regions , up to @xmath4  gev .",
    "several models have been developed for the neutrino - induced single pion production off the nucleon in the resonance region , and have been used as a basic ingredient to construct neutrino - nucleus interaction models  @xcite .",
    "so far , most models deal with only the single pion production . however , the neutrino - nucleon interaction in the resonance region is a multi - channel reaction .",
    "two - pion production has a contribution comparable to the single pion production .",
    "@xmath5 and kaon productions can also happen . in order to deal with this kind of multi - channel reaction ,",
    "an ideal approach is to develop a unitary coupled - channels model ; this is what we will pursue .",
    "recently we developed a unitary dynamical coupled - channels ( dcc ) model that can be extended to the neutrino reactions  @xcite .",
    "our dcc model is based on a comprehensive analysis of @xmath6 reactions in the resonance region , taking account of the coupled - channels unitarity including the @xmath7 channel . in this contribution , we report our first step of extending the dcc model to the neutrino reactions  @xcite . for that , we invoke the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) hypothesis that allows us to relate cross sections of the pion - induced meson productions to those of the corresponding neutrino - induced meson productions in the forward limit .",
    "in our dcc model  @xcite , we consider 8 channels : @xmath8 . the @xmath7 channel is included in the @xmath9 channels using feshbach s projection method , thus maintaining the three - body unitarity .",
    "meson - exchange driving terms are derived from meson - baryon lagrangian .",
    "the driving terms as well as bare @xmath10 excitation mechanisms are implemented in a coupled - channels lippmann - schwinger equation from which we obtain unitary reaction amplitudes .",
    "we analyzed @xmath0 reaction data simultaneously up to @xmath11  gev ( @xmath12 : total energy ) .",
    "the analysis includes fitting about 20,000 data points . to see the quality of the fit",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the single pion photoproduction observables from the dcc model compared with data .",
    "total cross sections ( @xmath13 ) , unpolarized differential cross sections ( @xmath14 ) and photon asymmetry ( @xmath15 ) for @xmath16 from the dcc model  @xcite are compared with data .",
    "the total energy is denoted by @xmath12 , and the scattering angle of the pion by @xmath17 .",
    ", width=453 ]    as seen in the figure , our dcc model gives a reasonable description of meson production data in the resonance region . as a consequence ,",
    "the dcc model contains all four - star resonances ( and more ) listed by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "thus the dcc model provides a good basis with which we proceed to the neutrino reactions .",
    "kinematic variables used in the following discussion are as follows .",
    "we consider the inclusive @xmath18 reactions ( @xmath19 ... etc . ) , where @xmath20 for the charged - current ( cc ) reactions .",
    "although we do not show a result , the neutral - current reactions can be studied in a similar manner .",
    "we assume that leptons are massless . in the laboratory frame , the four - momentum are defined to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with the momentum transfer between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27",

    "are denoted as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the nucleon mass . also , we set @xmath37 so that @xmath38 defines the @xmath39-direction of this frame .",

    "the weak current consists of the vector ( @xmath60 ) and axial ( @xmath61 ) currents . because of the vector current conservation @xmath62 in the isospin limit , the divergence of the axial current remains . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , we can define the pion field with the divergence of the axial currents as @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the pion decay",
    "constant ( pion mass ) , and @xmath66 is the normalized interpolating pion field with the isospin state @xmath67 .",
    "furthermore , the matrix element @xmath68 at @xmath59 can be expressed as @xmath69 here , @xmath70 is the t - matrix element of the @xmath71 reaction in the @xmath72 center - of - mass frame , and the incoming pion is off - mass - shell @xmath73 . using eqs .",
