    "in general , when an elastic sheet bends it will also stretch . while the energy associated with bending",
    "is purely geometrical  depending on the surface curvature  the energy associated with stretching will depend on additional material degrees of freedom .",
    "however , if the sheet is very thin compared to a typical radius of curvature , stretching will typically become far more costly than bending ; thus , if stretching does occur , it will tend to be confined within a set of sharp peaks connected by a network of folds in the sheet @xcite .",
    "this observation has attracted many physicists in the last decade , who have started to look at the properties of these defects in detail ( a nice review is provided in reference @xcite ) .",
    "the limiting behavior of thin sheets has one striking feature : it involves only the geometrical degrees of freedom of the sheet , in particular the bending energy depends only on its shape ; unstretchability constrains what shapes are accessible .",
    "this simple picture turns out to provide a description of the behavior of a range of real materials on widely differing scales : it is equally valid for a sheet of graphene on microscopic scales as it is for a sheet of paper on macroscopic ones @xcite . corresponding materials of soft matter have been studied only recently , mainly inspired by biology .",
    "it was shown for example , that growing tissues or thermo - responsive gels can be described within the same limit if they are sufficiently thin @xcite .",
    "a general treatment of their stability is , however , still lacking .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analyze the stability of the basic building block of such materials , the conical defect .",
    "approaching the stability of the equilibrium states of an unstretchable sheet is complicated by the local nature of the constraints .",
    "these constraints distinguish their treatment from that of a fluid membrane which can also be modeled geometrically @xcite .",
    "in fluid membranes the penalty associated with shear is very small so that it behaves like a fluid along tangential directions .",
    "if there are constraints in the latter they tend to be global in nature : area , enclosed volume or  in a bilayer ",
    "area difference between inner and outer layer may be constrained @xcite . in an unstretchable sheet , however , the constraints are local .",
    "unstretchability translates into a constraint on the metric tensor induced on the surface @xcite .",
    "while the two limits lend themselves to a geometrical description the physical behavior they display is qualitatively very different .",
    "this is reflected in how one goes about examining this behavior .",
    "the metric constraint lends rigidity to the surface with respect to its behavior as a fluid membrane . whereas a shape that is stable as a fluid membrane will also be stable",
    "if it is unstretchable , the converse is not true : unstable modes of a fluid membrane will tend to become inaccessible when the constraint on the surface is accommodated . as a case in point",
    ", there are conical defects that are generic stable features of unstretchable flat sheets .",
    "if the apex of the cone is part of the surface it is not possible to smooth it out by surface deformations that preserve the conical metric . in a fluid membrane ,",
    "however , the energy will be lowered by smoothing out the singularity at the apex .",
    "thus , conical defects will never appear as stable features of a fluid membrane . in this paper",
    "the discrepancy will be quantified .",
    "the stability of simple fluid membrane equilibrium states  spheres and cylinders  was addressed by helfrich and ou - yang in the late 80s @xcite .",
    "this involves the evaluation of the second variation of the bending energy about these surface states .",
    "this was a non - trivial calculation and , not surprisingly , their approach was adapted specifically to these states . later",
    "a framework was developed which does not depend explicitly on the equilibrium state @xcite .    to accommodate the unstretchability of the sheet",
    ", we will adopt the method of lagrange multipliers in the calculus of variations to enforce the corresponding metric constraint . like the construction for fluid membranes developed in @xcite the framework we will develop will not depend explicitly on the particular equilibrium shape .",
    "our focus will be on flat sheets , which can be modeled as surfaces with vanishing gaussian curvature , and we will derive an explicit expression for the second variation of the bending energy subject to this constraint . the unstretchability manifests itself in the important respect that the second variation , unlike its fluid membrane counterpart , depends now on both the normal and tangential deformations of the surface .",
    "this is , as we will see , because the constraint spoils the identification of tangential deformations with reparametrizations .",
    "that an exact framework exists at all is somewhat surprising ; that the calculation is largely tractable analytically is even more so .",
    "this geometrical framework will be used to examine the stability of the equilibrium states of a circular flat sheet with a conical defect at its center .",
    "such surfaces are in one - to - one correspondence with closed curves of fixed length on the unit sphere .",
    "we will focus , in particular , on a sheet with a surplus angle at this point @xcite ( see also @xcite for a related example involving nematic solids ) . unlike their counterparts with an angle deficit such cones possess an infinite number of equilibrium states in the absence of external forces . if the surplus angle is sufficiently small , so that self - contacts do not occur , these shapes are characterized by an @xmath0-fold symmetry beginning with a @xmath5-fold . to assess their stability",
    "we obtain an explicit expression for the second variation of the energy about each of these states .",
    "this will involve a self - adjoint fourth - order linear differential operator , @xmath6 , which depends explicitly on the curvature of the conical state .",
    "the accessible modes of deformation are described by the eigenmodes of this operator consistent with a global linear constraint associated with the unstretchability . a negative eigenvalue signals an instability .",
    "if the surplus angle is small this constraint is tractable analytically and an exact fourier analysis of stability is possible .",
    "the rotational invariance of the energy implies the existence of three zero modes of deformation for each equilibrium state of the conical defect . an exact expression for these modes",
    "will be provided .",
    "two of them correspond to rotations about axes orthogonal to the axis of symmetry . for small surplus angles",
    "they possess a pair of nodes .",
    "the third zero mode is odd and corresponds to a rotation about this axis ; it has @xmath7 nodes in this limit .",
    "all eigenmodes with an intermediate number of nodes will be unstable .",
    "in general , an exact treatment of stability eludes us .",
    "so we develop an approximation for larger surplus angle by introducing a fourier expansion of the modes ; using the gram - schmidt process we construct an orthonormal basis satisfying the global constraint .",
    "the matrix elements of the linear operator are evaluated . while the ground state is stable",
    " like its ice - cream counterpart  as one would have predicted , all excited states are unstable .",
    "the detailed nature of this instability is , however , rather interesting .",
    "the @xmath0-fold beginning with @xmath8 will possess @xmath2 unstable modes .",
    "these modes occur in pairs with even and odd parity with respect to the @xmath0-fold . for low surplus angles ,",
    "each mode consists of a single frequency .",
    "as the surplus angle increases higher frequencies enter and the number of nodes of each mode increases .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to order modes in a manner analogous to the small surplus angle limit .",
    "the spectrum of the operator @xmath6 will be discussed and the dominant mode of instability will be identified for each excited state .",
    "we will model the unstretchable sheet in terms of a surface which is described parametrically by three functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 providing its position in three - dimensional space .",
    "the bending energy associated with the folded state of the surface is quadratic in curvature , @xmath11 = \\frac{1}{2}\\int da\\,\\ , k ^2 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the area element induced on the surface and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the two principal curvatures .",
    "@xmath16 $ ] thus involves only the geometry of the surface .",
    "once the geometry is specified , the bending energy is also .",
    "we will work in units in which the rigidity modulus is unity .",
    "the induced metric tensor on the surface is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , are the two tangent vectors of the surface adapted to the parametrization by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this parametrization will be fixed once and for all .",
    "geometrically , the unstretchability of the sheet is then the statement that the surface is isometric , @xmath22 , the only admissible deformations are those keeping @xmath23 fixed . a natural way to keep track of this constraint in the calculus of variations is to replace @xmath16 $ ] by the functional @xcite @xmath24= h_b[{{\\boldsymbol{x } } } ] - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\int da\\ , t^{ab } \\ , ( g_{ab}- g_{ab}^{(0)})\\,.\\ ] ] the symmetric tensor @xmath25 is the set of lagrange multipliers associated with the constraint that @xmath23 coincides with some fixed metric @xmath26 . in particular , we will be interested in a surface that is a circular flat disc with a conical singularity , described by the line element @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance to the apex of this cone and @xmath29 ranges between 0 and some value @xmath30 .",
    "however , our framework  at least in its initial stage  will not require us to specify @xmath26 explicitly .",
    "recall that a surface is completely determined once the metric tensor @xmath23 and the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath31 are specified @xcite .",
    "the symmetric second rank tensor @xmath32 is a measure of how fast the normal vector @xmath33 rotates into one direction as it is moved along another . unlike @xmath23 , it depends explicitly on this vector .",
    "the principal curvatures , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are the maximum and minimum values of the shape operator @xmath32 .",
    "they are assumed along two tangents  the principal directions  which are always perpendicular . fixing the metric places a constraint on deformations of the surface that is more severe than may ,",
    "at first , appear .",
    "a familiar example is provided by the pingpong ball in which curvature and spherical topology together conspire to produce a geometry that is rigid under isometric deformations .    in order to say something about stability we first identify the euler - lagrange equations that describe the equilibrium states subject to the constraint .",
    "consider a deformation @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "as described in reference @xcite , where the variational framework developed in references @xcite and @xcite was adapted to accommodate the metric constraint , the corresponding change in @xmath36 at first order is given , modulo a boundary term , by @xmath37 where @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the gaussian curvature .",
    "the constraint adds a term linear in curvature to the normal euler - lagrange derivative @xmath40 . unlike a fluid membrane ,",
    "the tangential counterpart is not identically zero .",
    "the equilibrium of the sheet is then described by the euler - lagrange equations : @xmath41 in equilibrium , the tangential stress @xmath25 associated with the metric constraint is conserved .",
    "this equation involves only the intrinsic geometry .",
    "the extrinsic geometry enters through the boundary conditions on the free surface of the sheet . in general",
    ", these conditions will involve the introduction of a boundary layer in which stretching is admitted @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in the case we will treat here , the energy itself will be independent of the precise nature of these conditions .",
    "the only component of @xmath25 which enters the stability analysis is the trace @xmath42 coupling to curvature in @xmath40 . in @xcite it was shown that this component is insensitive to boundary conditions .    we now need to extend this framework to address the stability of equilibrium shapes . to do this it is necessary to expand @xmath36 to second order about solutions of the euler - lagrange equations . note that when the euler - lagrange equations are satisfied , @xmath43 here @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the first order change in @xmath40 given by eq.([eq : eperpx ] ) under the isometry @xmath46 , maintaining @xmath25 fixed .",
    "let us examine @xmath47 .",
    "note first that terms involving the deformed christoffel connection @xmath48 vanish whenever @xmath49 .",
    "a more general statement is possible : whenever @xmath50 , the variation commutes with covariant differentiation .",
    "we now integrate by parts to express the second term appearing in eq.([eq : del2h0 ] ) in the form @xmath51 modulo a divergence .",
    "the first term cancels an identical term appearing in @xmath52 ( see eq.([eq : deleperp ] ) ) ; the second term vanishes because @xmath53 what is left is the surprisingly simple expression @xmath54 superficially , it might appear that the second order deformation is identical to the one that would have been obtained ( see reference @xcite ) had @xmath25 been treated as a parameter .",
    "all that one seems to have achieved is the satisfaction of having dotted all of the i s , confirming that what one might have guessed is also correct .",
    "the presence of the constraint , however , spoils the identification of tangential deformations with reparametrizations of the surface : in particular , a tangential deformation of @xmath40 does not vanish . while @xmath40 is a surface scalar , it involves the tangential stress @xmath25 which does not depend explicitly on @xmath55 .",
    "it is thus not completely determined by the local surface geometry . can be identified with a reparametrization of the surface ( a lie derivative ) .",
    "it thus vanishes when its argument vanishes . ] as a consequence @xmath56 is not the same as @xmath57 in an equilibrium state , and it is no longer legitimate to replace one by the other as it was in the case of a fluid membrane ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "while this does not appear to bode well , the evaluation of @xmath56 turns out to be simpler than that of @xmath57 .",
    "this is because it is possible to exploit the fact that isometric variations commute with covariant differentiation . at a later stage in the calculation",
    ", it will be necessary to implement the metric constraint explicitly to eliminate tangential deformations in favor of normal ones .    to obtain eq.([eq : del2hx ] ) we discarded a boundary term in eq.([eq : nabt ] ) involving @xmath58 .",
    "had we kept track of it , we would have seen that it cancels a counterpart originating in the boundary term that tags along on the right hand side of eq.([eq : delh ] ) when derivatives of @xmath46 are collected in a divergence .",
    "there remains to determine @xmath56 appearing in eq.([eq : del2hx ] ) .",
    "it is useful to think of the normal euler - lagrange derivative , @xmath59 , defined by eq.([eq : eperpx ] ) as a sum of two terms .",
    "the bending part depends on the extrinsic geometry only through the mean curvature . using the fact that both the laplacian and the gaussian curvature are invariants under isometry , it is simple to see that @xmath60 the bending contribution only requires the evaluation of @xmath61 .",
    "the tensor @xmath62 does , however , enter the source term associated with the constraint . in appendix  [ app:1stvariationkkab ] , @xmath62 and @xmath61",
    "are given in terms of the deformation @xmath63 . in the following",
    "we will specialize the obtained expressions to study the stability of conical defects on a flat unstretchable sheet .",
    "we will use the representation of the conical defect as a closed curve @xmath64 on a unit sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : econe ] ) .",

    "it is convenient to parametrize the curve by arc - length .",
    "the total length of the curve @xmath66 will be invariant under isometry .",
    "indeed , the intrinsic geometry of the cone is characterized completely by @xmath67 . for technical simplicity ,",
    "let us suppose that this cone has a fixed finite radius @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 , this cone will be isometric to a planar disc . if @xmath70 , it will exhibit an angle deficit at its apex .",
