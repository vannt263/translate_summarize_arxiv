    "<S> in contrast to laser - powered self - induced oscillations , work extraction from a broadband heat bath does not require coherence or phase - locking : an initial phase - averaged coherent state of the oscillator still yields work , as opposed to an initial fock - state .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum optomechanics has exhibited tremendous theoretical and experimental progress in recent years towards controlled manipulations of the interaction of cavity photons with mechanical oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a prominent application of such manipulations has been the cooling of the mechanical oscillator @xcite and the converse regime of the amplification of its motion @xcite . provided the total damping rate of the oscillator is negative , the laser - driven cavity mode can parametrically amplify the mechanical motion in a self - sustained limit - cycle of oscillations@xcite that has a nonclassical counterpart @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we explore a different avenue , by raising the question : can the quantized oscillator transform thermal energy from a heat bath ( rather than a laser ) into mechanical work @xcite and thus _ act as a heat engine ? </S>",
    "<S> _ is such work similar to the self - induced oscillation discussed above ? </S>",
    "<S> these questions pertain to a subtle and unsettled issue : what is the _ proper definition of work _ in a quantized ( non - driven ) heat engine and what limitations does thermodynamics set on its extraction ?    </S>",
    "<S> we address these issues in the context of a realizable model that consists of a working medium , here the optical mode , constantly coupled to two distinct thermal baths and the mechanical oscillator that extracts the work . </S>",
    "<S> this is the standard situation in quantum open systems : our cavity mode constantly and unavoidably interacts with the outside electromagnetic vacuum ( the cold bath ) and with a spectrally filtered heat source ( hot bath ) . </S>",
    "<S> this setup is an example of a _ continuous _ heat machine that @xcite , contrary to more commonly known strokes - operated machines ( such as the carnot or otto engine ) @xcite , does not involve decoupling from and recoupling to alternate ( hot and cold ) thermal baths . </S>",
    "<S> continuous , fully quantized machines may therefore be operated completely autonomously , without external intervention , after launching them in a `` push @xmath0 go '' fashion . while there is a well - established definition of work as long as the heat machine is driven by an external field ( acting as a piston ) @xcite , it is more subtle to quantify work once this field is quantized . </S>",
    "<S> this subtlety is related to the fundamental question : how is the energy exchange between two quantum systems divided between heat and work ?    here </S>",
    "<S> we invoke the general and rigorous definition of maximal work storage ( capacity ) in the device : it is measured by the nonpassivity ( see below ) @xcite of the quantum state of the `` piston '' , here the mechanical oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the `` piston '' interacts with the working medium ( here the optical mode ) , which in turn is thermalized by the two baths . </S>",
    "<S> as the piston evolves , typically in a non - unitary fashion , its maximal work capacity ( nonpassivity ) changes . </S>",
    "<S> this rate of change is the maximal extractable power . in driven - piston scenarios @xcite </S>",
    "<S> work can be extracted by the piston from the system via unitary or classical operations . </S>",
    "<S> it is then independent of the initial state of the piston , which is not a thermodynamic resource . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we are concerned with work capacity in an autonomous , quantized setup that crucially depends on the initial state of the oscillator  just as the work stored in an initially compressed spring . </S>",
    "<S> this initial state is then an extra thermodynamic resource quantified by nonpassivity , which is largely ( but not completely ) determined by its negentropy ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> this extra resource may be crudely viewed as an additional ( pseudo ) `` bath '' whose state - dependent effective temperature @xmath1 may be ( for some time ) arbitrarily low . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this extra resource may yield higher efficiency than the standard carnot - cycle efficiency 1-tc / th , where the only resources are the hot and cold baths at temperatures th and tc , respectively . consistency with the second law is ensured by construction ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> not less important is the validity of this analysis for _ arbitrary nonunitary and nonadiabatic evolution _ </S>",

    "<S> the cavity mode o directly interacts with two thermal baths : hot ( @xmath8 ) and cold ( @xmath9 ) baths with non - flat spectra , whereas the oscillator m is damped by a nearly - markovian phonon bath . </S>",
    "<S> the response ( coupling ) spectra of the cold ( c ) and hot ( h ) baths may be _ broad _ , as opposed to a single - mode laser , but controllable , as detailed below : we shall take the hot bath to be a _ spectrally - filtered broadband _ source of thermal noise and the cold bath to be the vacuum that is coupled to the cavity mode , with typically a lorentzian - shaped spectrum @xcite ( fig [ fig : ohe]b ) .    in particular , a toroid microcavity is a candidate for implementing the model mentioned above . while the microcavity losses are described by the coupling to the cold bath , a second hot bath could be coupled to the cavity through an optical fiber taper ( see fig [ fig : ohe](a ) ) .    </S>",
