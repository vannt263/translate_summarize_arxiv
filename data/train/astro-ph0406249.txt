    "observational studies of the star formation history of the universe indicate that the star formation density rises rapidly from the present to z @xmath2 1 with very uncertain behavior at higher redshifts ( e.g. , elbaz & cesarsky 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "determining the luminosity functions and redshift distribution of dusty starburst galaxies is crucial to deducing the star formation history of the universe .",
    "the infrared and submillimeter windows are ideal hunting grounds for discovering these sources as most of the luminosity from starbursts is re - radiated by dust at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "a closely related problem is discriminating between starbursts and agns as the fundamental power source for heating this dust .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) detected such infrared galaxies down to @xmath2 0.1 mjy at @xmath215 @xmath0 m within some small survey areas , such as the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) fields number 1415 + 52 and 0300 + 00 ( flores et al .",
    "1999 ) and the hubble deep field north ( hdfn ) @xcite .",
    "the redshift distribution of the iso sources peak at z @xmath2 1 .",
    "these results are used to infer the evolution of star formation under the assumption that these galaxies are primarily powered by starbursts . in some cases ,",
    "this assumption can be confirmed by optical emission line ratios , but in many cases - especially the most luminous sources - the optical spectra show indicators of agn @xcite , so it can not be determined what fraction of the infrared luminosity derives from a starburst compared to the fraction from the agn .",
    "if z @xmath3 1 galaxies are similar to those in the local universe we would expect starbursts to have strong polycyclic - aromatic hydrocarbon features ( pah , at rest wavelengths 6.2 @xmath0 m , 7.7 @xmath0 m , and 11.3 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "these are thought to arise in photodissociation regions around hot stars and are so common in starbursts that they are used as a starburst vs agn spectral classifier , as the pahs are easily destroyed by the harder radiation field from an agn accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "laurent et al . ( 2000 ) extend this scheme to three templates ( agn , pdr and hii ) to discriminate between a pure agn component , quiescent star forming regions with strong pahs associated with the pdr component and a starburst component with weak pah emission ( i.e hii - like emission ) . the mid - infrared ( mir )",
    "continuum can also have a silicate absorption feature ( rest wavelength @xmath2 9.7 @xmath0 m ) from an embedded agn within an optically thick torus , or from optically thick dust cocoons around hot stars .",
    "an embedded source is also likely to have ice and gas absorption features ( e.g. , spoon et al .",
    "this issue ) .",
    "pah and silicate features as strong as those in many nearby galaxies would allow determination of redshifts to z @xmath2 3 for galaxies as faint as @xmath2 1 mjy at 16 @xmath0 m using the low resolution modules of the infrared spectrograph on spitzer ( houck et al .",
    "this issue ) . at z @xmath4 1",
    "these objects are likely to be be ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) with l@xmath5l@xmath6and hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hlirg ) with l@xmath7l@xmath6 .",
    "if these objects are similar to those found in the local universe we may expect to find a dominent agn in sources with l@xmath8l@xmath6@xcite .",
    "it is anticipated that many important discoveries from spitzer will derive from wide area surveys , which will reveal large numbers of infrared galaxies that are too faint for optical follow - up .",
    "hence , the capability to measure faint mid - infrared ( mir ) spectra is crucial .",
    "observations of cfrs 14.1157 were taken as a first test of the irs long - wavelength low resolution spectrograph s ( irs - ll ) ability to measure the redshift of faint z @xmath3 1 galaxies using mir spectral features and to characterise the mir luminosity .",
    "the serendipitous observation of cfrs 14.9025 , a galaxy at z = 0.155 having flux only 0.35 mjy at 16 @xmath0 m , further demonstrates the ability of the irs to observe faint sources .",
    "cfrs 14.1157 is a galaxy identified with the radio source 15v23 ( fomalont et .",
    "al . 1991 ) .",
    "the source is at a z of 1.15 ( hammer et .",
    "al . 1995 ) , which corresponds to a luminosity distance of 7900 mpc ( h@xmath9 = 71 kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 = 0.27 , @xmath12 = 0.73 , @xmath13 = 0 ) and an angular scale of 8 kpc per arcsecond .",
    "the source was detected by isocam with a 15 @xmath0 m  flux of 2.3 @xmath1 0.08 mjy @xcite .",
    "however , the source appears extended and revised photometry indicate that its flux is 3.1 @xmath1 0.3 mjy ( flores private communication ) .",
    "the hst i band image shows a multi - component source embedded in diffuse emission and extended over a region of @xmath2 2.5  ( 20 kpc ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected x - ray emission with xmm - newton and inferred the presence of a fairly heavily obscured agn from the 0.5 - 2/2 - 10 kev band hardness ratio of @xmath2 -0.3 .",
    "however , a comparison between the observed submm flux and that predicted from the agn led @xcite to conclude that there is a strong starburst component present .    the empirical limits which can be reached by the irs in searching for spectral features in faint sources and techniques for optimal spectral extraction and template fitting using the smart analysis package ( higdon et al .",

    "the irs - ll module provides low resolution spectra ( resolving power , 64 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath14 128 ) between 14.0 @xmath0 m and 21.3 @xmath0 m  in long - low 2 ( irs - ll2 ) and 19.5 @xmath0 m  - 38.0 @xmath0 m in long - low 1 ( irs - ll1 ) .",
    "the observation was made on the 5@xmath16 of january 2004 in the irs staring mode aor , which integrated for 6 @xmath17 120 seconds at each of the two nominal nod positions on each of the two slits ( for observing mode details see chapter 7 of the spitzer observers manual ( som ) ) .",
    "therefore , the total integration time required to obtain the entire spectrum shown in figure 1 was 2880 seconds .    in order to accurately place the source on the slit , cfrs 14.1157",
    "was first observed in the irs blue peak - up camera .",
    "this also gives an independent measure of the flux at 16 @xmath0 m .",

    "the slit orientation fortuitously included cfrs 14.9025 , see figure 2 .",

    "the source positions and 16 @xmath0 m  fluxes are listed in table 1 .",
    "the spectral data were processed as far as the un - flatfielded two dimensional image using the standard irs pipeline ( see the som ) .",
