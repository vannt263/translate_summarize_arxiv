    "the non - linear schrodinger equation @xmath3 was first solved by zakharov and shabat in 1971 @xcite . since then",

    "such generalizations were analyzed in @xcite and this work can be viewed as its continuation .",
    "there is a close relationship between mnls equations and homogeneous and symmetric spaces @xcite .",
    "soon after the pioneer paper by zakharov and shabat @xcite , manakov @xcite proposed a two - component nls model .",
    "both nls models have important applications in nonlinear optics , plasma physics , hydrodynamics etc .",
    "manakov model was easily generalized to @xmath5-components known as vector nls ; it has also non - euclidean version ( see @xcite ) : @xmath6 here we should mention another famous paper by zakharov and schulman @xcite where they prove a theorem classifying the integrable two - component nls systems .",
    "they request that the interaction hamiltonian depends only on @xmath7 and @xmath8 and prove that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : man ] ) and ( [ eq : man2 ] ) are the only integrable mnls .",
    "the next step in studying multicomponent nls equations is based on the important idea of fordy and kulish relating the mnls equations to the symmetric spaces @xcite .",
    "the present paper is continuation of @xcite and a sequel of papers @xcite in which mikhailov s reduction group @xcite was applied on the mnls thus deriving new versions with small number of components .",
    "below we limit ourselves with the mnls related to the d.iii-type symmetric spaces and using mikhailov reduction groups of the type @xmath0 derive new types of 2-component nls equations . these are * not * counterexamples to the zakharov - schulman theorem because the corresponding interaction hamiltonians depend not only on @xmath9 , but also on @xmath10 .    in section 2",
    "we collect preliminary facts about the d.iii symmetric spaces and the types of reductions that will be applied to the lax pairs . in section 3",
    "we analyze two types of @xmath11-reductions of mnls related to the algebra @xmath12 . in section 4",
    "we analyze @xmath13-reductions of mnls related to the algebra @xmath14 .",
    "to each of these cases we relate a new two - component nls equation . in section 5",

    "for simplicity we will assume that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 are schwartz - type functions of their variables .",
    "an important and systematic tool to construct new integrable nlee is the so - called reduction group @xcite .",
    "we will start with the local @xmath15-reductions : @xmath43 the consequences of these reductions and the constraints they impose on the fas and the gauss factors of the scattering matrix are well known , see @xcite .",
    "since we are dealing with @xmath44-algebras we take into account that @xmath45 is an inner automorphism .",

    "namely , we will consider reduction of type @xmath54 of the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are automorphisms of order @xmath59 .",
    "this will restrict the number of the independent variables in @xmath93 to twice the number of orbits of @xmath91 .",

    "basic tools in this analysis are the jost solutions ( we will avoid writing explicit time dependence , to avoid cluttering the notation ) @xmath132 formally the jost solutions must satisfy volterra type integral equations .",
    "if we introduce @xmath133 then @xmath134 must satisfy @xmath135 the jost solutions can not be extended for @xmath136 .",
    "however some of their columns can be extended for @xmath137 or @xmath138 .",
    "the jost solutions can be written in the following block - matrix form @xmath139 where the superscript @xmath140 shows that the corresponding @xmath141 block allows analytic extension for @xmath142 .",
    "then the scattering matrix is introduced by @xmath143 where by `` hat '' we denote matrix inverse . since without loss of generality",
    "the jost solutions are group elements the scattering matrix will also be a group element .",
    "note that if we impose one of the @xmath54 reduction ( @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) on the lax pair then @xmath144 must satisfy one of the relations below .",
    "@xmath145 this imposes the following constraints on the blocks @xmath146 and @xmath147 : @xmath148 for the type - a reductions and @xmath149 where the constant matrices @xmath150 and @xmath151 , @xmath152 are given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab0 ] ) .",
    "the second reduction @xmath153 imposes on the jost solutions and on the scattering matrix the constraints ( below  hat  denotes matrix inverse ) : @xmath154 the corresponding blocks of @xmath144 and its inverse @xmath155 must satisfy @xmath156    we end this section by formulating the time - dependence of the scattering matrix which follows naturally from the lax representation ( [ eq : mop ] ) : @xmath157=0 , \\quad \\mbox { i.e. } \\quad   \\begin{aligned } \\frac{\\partial \\a^\\pm } { \\partial t } & = 0 , & \\quad   i \\frac{\\partial \\b^\\pm } { \\partial t } \\mp b^\\pm ( \\lambda , t ) = 0 , \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\c^\\pm } { \\partial t } & = 0 , & \\quad   i \\frac{\\partial \\d^\\pm } { \\partial t } \\pm b^\\pm ( \\lambda , t ) = 0 . \\end{aligned } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , the diagonal blocks can be viewed as generating functionals of the integrals of motion of the mnls .",
    "the inverse scattering method , applied to the scalar nls equation has all the properties of a generalized fourier transform ( gft ) .",
    "the derivation of these properties is based on the wronskian relations @xcite .",
    "these results allow natural generalizations to the mnls equations , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the mapping @xmath158 is directly related to the gft which instead of the usual exponentials @xmath159 uses the so - called ` squared solutions ' of @xmath94 , @xmath160 . here",
    "@xmath161 are the fas of @xmath94 and @xmath162 is a projector onto the image of the operator @xmath163 .",
    "next , one can : i ) prove that the system of ` squared solution ' @xmath164 are complete set of functions on @xmath35 ; ii ) the minimal set of scattering data can be viewed as expansion coefficients of @xmath36 over @xmath165 ; ii ) the variations of the minimal set of scattering data can be viewed as expansion coefficients of @xmath166 over @xmath165 .",
    "finally these expansions can be used to derive the fundamental properties of the whole class of multi - component nlee , for more details and proofs see . @xcite . in particular",
    "this means that the mnls equations admit a hierarchy of hamiltonian formulations , see @xcite .",
    "the simplest of them has as hamiltonian @xmath167 , \\left [ \\ad_j^{-1 } q , q\\right]\\right\\rangle \\right ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the relevant symplectic form is given by @xmath168 the other members of the hierarchy are generated by the recursion operators @xmath169 .",
    "the proof of their compatibility is based on the completeness relations for the ` squared solutions ' that are eigenfunctions of @xmath169 .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that the new 2-component nls will also possess hierarchies of hamiltonian structures .",
    "these type of results can be viewed also as more strict proofs , that have been formally derived by dickey and gelfand @xcite , by drinfeld and sokolov @xcite and by lombardo and mikhailov @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "our last remark is that one can apply similar ideas also to the other types of symmetric spaces .",
    "thus one can find other 2-component mnls related to the other symmetric spaces : bd.i , c.i etc .",
    "these and other natural problems , such as deriving their soliton solutions , the construction of their integrals of motion , derivation of the fundamental properties etc . will be published elsewhere .",
    "one of us ( vsg ) is grateful to professor f. calogero for the useful discussion and suggestions .",
    "the simple lie algebras @xmath170 are usually represented by a @xmath65 antisymmetric matrices . in this realization the cartan subalgebra is not diagonal , so we will use a realization for which every @xmath171 satisfies @xmath172 here the block @xmath173 is a @xmath141 matrix given by @xmath174 , where @xmath175 are @xmath40 matrix given by @xmath176 . with this definition the cartan subalgebra",
