    "communication protocols based on quantum signals have attracted increasing interest in the recent years , since they offer the possibility of enhancing either the communication capacity or the security by exploiting the very quantum nature of the information carriers .",
    "information may be indeed conveyed from a sender to a receiver through quantum channels . in order to achieve this goal",
    "a transmitter prepares a quantum state drawn from a collection of known states and sends it through a given quantum channel .",
    "the receiver retrieves the information by measuring the channel in order to discriminate among the set of possible preparations and , in turn , to determine the transmitted signal .",
    "the encoding states are generally not orthogonal and also when orthogonal signals are transmitted , they usually lose orthogonality because of noisy propagation along the communication channel . therefore , in general , no measurement allows the receiver to distinguish perfectly between the signals @xcite and the need of optimizing the detection strategy unavoidably arises .",
    "a different approach , which will be used in this paper , is to encode information in the degrees of freedom of a correlated state shared by the two parties . in this framework ,",
    "the two parties jointly ( and independently ) measure the state and extract the transmitted symbol according to a previously agreed inference rule .",
    "this kind of schemes , which may be symmetric or asymmetric depending on the nature of the channels , may serve either to send a message or to share a cryptographic key .",
    "in particular , entanglement - based protocols with nonlocal correlations between spatially separated locations have been proved very effective to provide a pair of legitimate users with methods to share a secure cryptographic key via quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . besides , the nonclassicality of entangled states can be used to improve the monitoring of a state against disturbance and/or decoherence , which , in turn , made entanglement useful to detect unwanted measurement attempts , _",
    "i.e _ increasing the security of communication . indeed , several quantum - based cryptographic protocols @xcite have been suggested and implemented either for qubits or continuous variable ( cv ) systems .    communication protocols and qkd schemes have been firstly developed for single qubit @xcite or entangled qubit pairs @xcite , and practically implemented using faint laser pulses or photon pairs from spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) in a pumped nonlinear crystal @xcite .",
    "recently , much attention has been devoted to investigating the use of cv systems in quantum information processing .",
    "in fact , continuous - spectrum quantum variables may be easily manipulated in order to perform various quantum information processes .",
    "this is the case of multiphoton gaussian state of light , _",
    "e.g. _ squeezed - coherent beams and twin - beams , by means of linear optical circuits , photodetection and homodyne detection .",
    "in addition , non gaussian cv states of two modes may be generated either by conditional measurements @xcite or concurrent nonlinearities . in turn , cv multiphoton states @xcite , may be used to increase the effectiveness and reliability of quantum communications and qkd .",
    "several cv qkd protocols have already been developed on the basis of quadrature modulations coding of single squeezed @xcite , coherent @xcite and entangled beam pairs @xcite .",
    "protocols using the sub - shot - noise fluctuations of photon - number difference of two correlated beams @xcite , the sub - shot - noise modulations @xcite and the sub - shot - noise fluctuations of the photon numbers in each of the correlated modes @xcite have been proposed .",
    "although for cv protocols unconditional security proofs have not been obtained yet @xcite , they are of interest and deserve investigations mostly due to the potential gain in communication effectiveness .    in this paper",
    "we address binary and quaternary communication channels based on photon - number continuous - variable multiphoton entangled states ( pnes ) , in particular we consider two - mode coherently - correlated ( tmc ) or twin - beam ( twb ) states .",
    "the communication protocol is based on photon number correlations and realized upon choosing a shared ( set of ) threshold(s ) to convert the outcome of a joint photon number measurement into a symbol from a discrete alphabet .",
    "notice that , in principle , entanglement itself is not needed to establish this class of communication channels , which are based on photon - number correlations owned also by separable mixed states . on the other hand , purity of the support state is relevant to increase security of the channel .",
    "in fact , if the information is encoded in classically correlated ( mixed ) states an intruder can easily measure the number of photons in either of the modes and then recreate the mixed state mode by activating the corresponding number of single - photon or photon - pair sources ( the latter case with the degenerate spdc process is already quite realistic ) . thus the information encoded in the photon number of a mixed state mode can be effectively intercepted . on the other hand ,",
    "this attack is not effective in case of pnes - based channels , since the destruction of the mutual second order coherence of a pnes state can be revealed by a joint measurement on the two modes , which can be accomplished if the receiver , instead or besides extracting the bit value , randomly sends his mode or part of it back to the sender to let her check the presence of an eavesdropper , analogously to `` two - way '' quantum cryptography based on individually coherent entangled beams @xcite .",
    "for the pnes - based protocols although no strict proofs of security can be offered , tmc - based protocols may be proved secure against realistic intercept - resend eavesdropping .",
    "the security mostly relies on the fact that the generation of traveling fock states of radiation , despite several theoretical proposals based on tailored nonlinear interactions @xcite , conditional measurements @xcite , or state engineering @xcite , is still extremely challenging from the experimental point of view .",
    "overall , it is the joint requirement of correlation and purity that leads to individuate pnes as a suitable choice for building effective and , to some extent , secure communication channels",
    ".    the main goal of the paper is twofold .",
    "on the one hand we consider communication channels based on realistic class of pnes and analyze the effects of losses on the performances of the protocol . on the other hand ,",
    "we optimize the performances of our protocol and compare the results of pnes - based schemes to that obtained using a realistic kind of classically correlated ( mixed , separable ) states as a support .",
    "the evolution of tmc and twb in lossy channels , as well as that of classically correlated states , is analyzed to calculate the joint photon number distribution and evaluate the survival of correlations . using this results we determine the optimized bit discrimination thresholds and the corresponding channel capacity ( maximized mutual information ) for binary and quaternary alphabets .",
    "the effects of losses on security of the protocols against intercept - resend attacks are briefly discussed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ s : pnes ] we describe the communication protocol and introduce the correlated states , either pnes or classically correlated , that will be considered as a support . in section [",
    "s : loss ] we analyze the propagation of the above states in a lossy channel , and evaluate the joint photon number distribution and the correlations . in section [",
    "s : im ] we optimize the bit discrimination threshold for binary and quaternary alphabets and evaluate the corresponding channel capacity .",
    "finally , in section [ s : outro ] we briefly discuss security and close the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "quantum optical communication channels can be established using multiphoton entangled states of two field - mode , which provide the necessary correlations between the two parties . in this work",
    "we investigate the information capacity of quantum channels built using as a support a specific class of bipartite entangled states , which we refer to as photon - number entangled states ( pnes ) . in the fock number basis , pnes may be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 . as we will see an effective channel",
    "may be established exploiting the strong correlation between the photon number distributions of the two modes .",
    "indeed , pnes show perfect ( total ) correlations in the photon number , _ i.e. _ the correlation index @xmath3 with @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , is equal to one for any pnes . on the other hand ,",
    "the degree of entanglement strongly depends on the profile @xmath7 .",
    "pnes may be generated by means of parametric optical oscillator ( opo ) exploiting seeded pdc process in a nonlinear crystal placed in and optical cavity @xcite .",
    "several implementations have already been reported , with the generation of pnes with photon number statistics varying from super - poissonian to sub - poissonian after post - selection @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "several quantum communication schemes and qkd protocols were proposed using pnes , with information encoded in the beam intensity @xcite or intensity difference @xcite .",
    "the bits coding / decoding for a pnes - based communication protocol is rather natural : in the binary case each of the legitimate users measure the incoming photon number in a predetermined time slot and compare the obtained value to a given bit threshold .",
    "if the detected value is above the threshold the corresponding bit value is assigned to one , zero otherwise @xmath8 the scheme may be also extended to a @xmath9-letter protocol by introducing different thresholds @xmath10 the effectiveness of these generalizations depends of course on the beam intensity and on the resolution thresholds of the detectors .",
    "pnes - based protocols of this kind have been suggested @xcite and analyzed in the ideal case using two - mode coherently correlated ( tmc ) states using , in the the binary case , a threshold value equal to the integer part of the average photon number . in the fock basis tmc states @xcite are written as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes a modified bessel function of the first kind . without loss of generality",
    "we will consider @xmath14 as real throughout the paper .",
    "the average photon number of the state @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 tmc are eigenstates of the product of the annihilation operators of the two radiation modes @xmath17 =   \\rho_2 \\equiv \\hbox{tr}_1 [ |\\lambda\\rangle\\rangle\\langle\\langle \\lambda | ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{1}{i_0 ( 2 \\lambda ) } \\sum\\limits_n \\",
    ": \\frac{\\lambda ^{2n}}{n!^2}\\ :    sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "in fact , the mandel parameter @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 and it is negative for any value of @xmath14 .",
    "a communication channel based on tmc relies on the strong photon number correlations , which allow to decode a random bit sequence by carrying out independent and simultaneous intensity measurements at two remote locations . on the other hand ,",
    "the security of the scheme is based on checking the beam statistics coming from the measurement results against the ( sub - poissonian ) expected one .",
    "it was shown that any realistic eavesdropping attempts introduce perturbations that are significant enough to be detected , thus making eavesdropping ineffective @xcite .",
    "in addition , the extension to @xmath20-letter alphabets was shown to be effective , _",
    "i.e _ increase the information capacity to @xmath21 bits per measurements , also making the protocol more secure against intercept - resend attacks @xcite .",
    "another relevant class of pnes is given by the so - called twin - beam state ( twb ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are entangled two - mode gaussian states of the field and represents the crucial ingredient for cv teleportation and dense coding .",
    "without loss of generality we assume @xmath25 as real , the average photon number of twb is thus given by @xmath26 the two partial traces of @xmath27 are equal to thermal states @xmath28^{a^\\dag a}$ ] with @xmath29 average photon number each .",
    "the mandel parameter is positive and equal to @xmath30 for both the modes .",
    "as we will see , also twb may employed to built a cv communication protocol analogue to that described above .",
    "the channel capacity is generally larger than for tmc , though the super - poissonian statistics of the partial traces make the security issue more relevant .    in fig .",
    "[ tmcvstwb ] we show the typical photon number distribution @xmath31 of tmc and twb partial traces .",
    "we also report the degree of entanglement of the two states , evaluated as the von - neumann entropy @xmath32=-\\hbox{tr}[\\varrho\\log\\varrho]$ ] of the partial traces , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath33 = s[\\varrho_2]$ ] , as a function of the average photon number .",
    "notice that twbs show larger entanglement ; indeed they are maximally entangled states for a cv two - mode system at fixed energy @xcite .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "a question arises on whether security may be proved for pnes based communication channels . in the ideal case of no loss ,",
    "the intercept - resend strategy has been considered assuming that eve is able to produce strongly correlated beams source ( optimally the tmc - source @xcite ) and it has been shown that the state - cloning attempts can be revealed by checking the beam statistics , which is modified from sub - poissonian to super - poissonian by any eavesdropping attempt . since , as we have proved in this paper , the statistical properties are not changed by the propagation , tmc - based protocols are secure also in the presence of loss . as concern twb , security , remarkably security against intercept - resend attacks , can not be guaranteed through a check of the beam statistics .",
    "the twb - based protocols require the use of additional degrees of freedom , as for example binary randomization of polarization @xcite to guarantee security and to reveal eavesdropping actions .",
    "this may also be useful for tmc - based protocols , in order to achieve unconditional security .",
    "overall , there is a trade - off between the quantity of information one is able to transmit at fixed energy and the security of this transmission , with tmc offering more security at the price of decreasing the channel capacity .    in conclusion",
    ", we have analyzed lossy communication channels based on photon number entangled states and realized upon choosing a shared set of thresholds to convert the outcome of a joint photon number measurement into a symbol from a binary or a quaternary alphabet .",
    "we have focused on channels build using two - mode coherently - correlated or twin - beam states a support .",
    "the explicit optimization of the bit discrimination thresholds have been performed and the corresponding channel capacities have been compared to that of channels built using classically correlated ( separable ) states .",
    "we found that pnes are useful to improve capacity in the presence of noise , and that twb - based channels may transmit a larger amount of information than tmc - based ones at fixed energy and overall loss .",
    "the evolution of the entangled support , either tmc or twb , in lossy channels have been analyzed in details , showing that the beam statistics , either sub - poissonian for tmc or super - poissonian for twb , is not altered during propagation .",
    "the preservation of sub - poissonian statistics indicates that tmc - based protocols are secure against intercept - resend eavesdropping attacks , whereas twb - based protocols require the use of additional degrees of freedom , as for example binary randomization of polarization .",
    "we have analyzed the effects of asymmetric losses on the two beams , showing that i ) asymmetry of the channel does not dramatically affect the performances and ii ) placing the source of entanglement closer to one of the two parties results in a slight increase of the capacity for tmc - based protocols and a slight decrease for twb - based ones .",
    "we conclude that photon - number entangled states , either gaussian or non gaussian ones , are useful resources to implement effective quantum - enhanced communication channels in the presence of loss .",
