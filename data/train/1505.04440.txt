    "tn methods are based on variational tensor structure ansatze for the many - body wave function of the quantum system of interest : the tensor structure is chosen to best accommodate some general system properties , e.g. , dimensionality , boundary conditions and symmetries , while a controlled approximation is introduced in such a way that one can interpolate between a mean field and an exact representation of the system .",

    "secondly , the string breaking process is clearly a two - steps process : first a correlated pair is created in between odd - even sites , and later in between the even - odd sites ( blue - yellow checkerboard pattern inside the string in panels c1 and 2 ) .",
    "finally , for large @xmath14 and @xmath7 , when the string does not break , the correlations behavior drastically changes as well .",
    "there , within the string , the correlations are built periodically only between odd - even sites , while in the vacuum the correlations are drastically suppressed ( panel c3 )",
    ".    a transparent picture on how entanglement is generated during the quench dynamics can be gathered by monitoring the entanglement growth at different points in space . in fig .",
    "[ entropyprofile : fig ] we show the entanglement time evolution for a set of system bipartitions and parameters , e.g. , cutting the system in the middle of the string or in the vacuum",
    ".    the solid lines are results obtained for @xmath65 and @xmath67 , while the dashed lines correspond to the case @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the orange line represents the entanglement growth for a partition at lattice site @xmath88 , therefore in the center of the lattice region starting in the vacuum . in the zero - mass case",
    ", one can see that the entanglement entropy grows almost linearly for most part of the evolution - signaling the vacuum instability against resonant particle - antiparticle pair production . towards the end of the evolution ,",
    "the linear growth breaks down as boundary effects start to play a role .",
    "the remaining solid lines in fig .",
    "[ entropyprofile : fig ] represent the behavior of a partition between an even - odd lattice site ( violet ) and between an odd - even lattice site ( blue ) and display a more complex behavior .",
    "these results were obtained in the center of the string while it breaks up : the counter - phase oscillations indicate the competition of two states , together with an overall growth of the entanglement entropy , though not as fast as in the vacuum . as we have seen , in this regime the string breaking is a result of consecutive hopping processes : fermions hop on the lattice creating mass excitations followed by annihilations , which result in the string breaking with two remaining dynamical mesons .",
    "this dynamical process goes on and after two hopping processes the anti - string is created .",
    "[ entropyprofile : fig ] shows that these dynamics are well captured by the oscillations of the entanglement entropy .",
    "each maximum represents one hopping process : at the first maximum of the blue line the fermions are about to hop for the first time , while at the first maximum of the violet line the second hopping process is at its peak resulting in the string broken state . at around @xmath89",
    ", the blue line does not display a maximum : this depleted region signals the anti - string state , where the last hopping event creating the anti - string is again the first hopping to break the negative string ( and thus , it takes twice as long for the entropy to reach the next maximum ) .",
    "differently from before , in the massive scenario ( dashed lines ) , we see that the entanglement entropy for the vacuum stays close to zero as the large mass and electric coupling strongly suppress the particle - pair creation that triggered the strong growth of the entropy in the previous case .",
    "moreover , in the middle of the string the entanglement entropy is drastically affected : the blue dashed line initially behaves as the solid line in the massless case , reflecting the same mass excitation by pair creation .",
    "however , the violet dashed line always remains close to zero as further evolution into the string broken state is energetically forbidden : the state evolves back into the string and the correlations between the even - odd sites can not be created .",
    "the system is then oscillating between two almost degenerate states : the initial string state and the state made out of pairs .",
    "this results in the oscillating behavior of the entanglement entropy between zero and one .",
    "finally , the third case with @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( dot - dashed lines ) lies between the two previous limiting cases : here the string breaks , but does not evolve into an anti - string . in the vacuum ,",
    "the entanglement evolution is very similar to the first case ( @xmath92 ) as the entropy grows almost linearly after a transient regime .",
    "however , the slope is reduced by the nonzero mass .",
    "the entanglement in the center of the string initially evolves as for the massless case , but after the first two hopping processes for @xmath93 , the oscillation turns into vacuum - like growth .",
    "this is a strong indication for non - periodic string breaking : the dynamics , although being unitary , resemble a dissipative process where the electric field energy irreversibly disperses into the vacuum .",
    "this irreversible behavior directly resembles what we observe in the electric field dynamics , which does not display any clear periodic signature .      even more remarkably , the real - space particle creation and the entanglement dynamics are quantitatively tied .",
    "we concentrate on the signatures of the wavefront of the string imprinted on the evolution of the entanglement entropy .",
    "we consider the case @xmath54 as it is characterized by the most pronounced wavefront , where the string with its slow entanglement growth is embedded in the fast growing vacuum ( see fig .",
    "[ overview : fig ] , panel c1 ) . to characterize the entanglement spreading due to the wavefront",
    ", we exploit the fact that the entanglement entropy in the vacuum is constant in space even though it evolves in time .",
    "therefore , far enough from both sides of the string there is a plateau of constant entropy much higher than the entropy in the middle of the string .",
    "thus , to define the wavefront of entanglement spreading due to the string , one can look for the lattice site at which the entropy plateau starts to decrease .",
    "we identify this point computing the difference of entropy between nearest neighbor bipartitions : tracking when this quantity become bigger than a given threshold allows us to characterize the entanglement wavefront spreading .    in fig .",
    "[ spreadingee : fig ] we show the estimated spreading velocity for different values of the threshold : the limit for the threshold value going to zero gives an estimate of the spreading velocity .",
    "a power law fit results in a spreading velocity of @xmath94 in very good agreement with the analytic estimate of @xmath95 and the result from the electric field of @xmath96 demonstrating the intimate connection between entanglement and electric field spreading .",
    "bound states are a fundamental component of gauge theories , and understanding their complex internal structure is one of the most ambitious goals of computational physics  @xcite . in experiments , such internal structure",
    "is usually explored by colliding heavy ions , so that the energy released during the process can be released via particle - antiparticle creation .",
    "this makes the _ ab initio _ numerical simulations of such scattering processes challenging , as mc simulations suffer from a severe sign problem when tackling real - time dynamics .    here ,",
    "we show how tn simulations allow to investigate meson scattering for the ( 1 + 1)d qlm using tns .",
    "first , we present a general procedure to implement scattering processes between composite particles , and discuss the electric field dynamics after the collision",
    ". then , we present results for the entanglement dynamics during and after the collisions showing that the meson collision is accompanied by the creation of entanglement between the mesons themselves .",
    "indeed , as we will show , the entanglement is bounded by the propagation wavefronts of the particles after collision , and is characterized by a constant plateau of the entanglement entropy within the region .      in order to produce the scattering process",
    ", we shall start with two composite particles .",
    "each particle is charge / anti - charge pair , and divided only by one link , namely a meson , with opposite momentum .",
    "for the two - meson problem , there is a simple picture in the strong coupling limit : the massless theory is a free massive boson ( meson ) theory that is expected to become weakly interacting once a small mass term is included .",
    "hence , in the strong coupling region , a possible two - meson bound state is loosely bound , while in the weak coupling region it is tightly bound .",
    "we start the numerical simulation with the state represented in the cartoon ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ summary : fig ] : two mesons separated by a vacuum state of ten sites , which can be straightforwardly be written in a simple , separable matrix product state with @xmath21 .",
    "we provide momentum to the mesons by adiabatically moving them from the boundaries toward the center of the system : this is done by introducing a deep box - shaped potential that decouples the mesons from the rest of the system , with the only dynamics allowed being the oscillate between its position and a neighboring site .",
    "the box - potential is removed at time @xmath97 when the meson is exactly at half oscillation : from that point on the mesons evolve freely with an effective momentum mostly in one direction , one towards the other and eventually colliding  , the meson wave packets still spread slightly in both directions : however the centers of mass of the two mesons are clearly propagating with constant and opposite momentum until the scattering process occurs and the particles bounce back . ] . in order to avoid vacuum fluctuations during the process",
    ", we choose a large value of @xmath98 .",
    "[ scatt : fig ] shows an example of such a scattering process . in particular , it shows the absolute value of the electric field of two mesons approaching each other , colliding in the center and there parting again . while before the collision the meson are tightly bound , after the scattering process the electric field diffuses , and the corresponding wavefront has a significantly attenuated signal . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ scatt : fig ] , we monitor the time - evolution of the total particle number ( blue ) , clearly indicating that this quantity is approximately conserved over the entire time - evolution , due to the large electric field strength , which suppresses particle - antiparticle creation .",
    "a classical - like picture of the scattering process presented above , would have that two particles move against each other and then bounce back as there is not enough energy available to generate a more complex inelastic scattering .",
    "however , this picture is oversimplified , as this is a fully quantum process .",
    "indeed one can , once more , monitor the quantum correlations generated during the scattering process .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ escheat : fig ] , where we show the evolution of the bipartite entanglement entropy : one sees that entanglement is created and that it is mostly carried by the two mesons . in this parameter regime",
    ", the vacuum does not generate entanglement due to the very large value of @xmath99 . studying the bipartite entanglement entropy for different bipartitions and times",
    ", one clearly sees that there are two regimes : before the scattering occurs , the entanglement is present only in the bipartition that cuts the mesons wave packets , indicating two electron - positron wave packets internally correlated but not sharing any quantum correlations among them . to the contrary , after the scattering , the two wave packets become highly correlated even when their two centers of mass are clearly separated ( see fig .",
    "[ scatt : fig ] for times @xmath100 ) .",
    "the values of the entanglement entropy indicate that one ebit of quantum information has been created during the scattering process . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ escheat : fig ] , we present various cuts of the entanglement entropy profile taken at different times , together with a comparison with the entanglement generated by a single meson moving through the lattice ( dashed line ) .",
    "the difference of @xmath101 between the two cases ( highlighted in fig .",
    "[ escheat : fig ] , green bar ) clearly shows that one additional _",
    "ebit _ of entanglement has been generated during the scattering process : that is , that a singlet state has been created between the two indistinguishable mesons . the entropy has increased as the information on which process occurs ( either mesons bouncing and moving back , or each one moving freely through the other one and keeping moving with its own momentum ) is completely lost .",
    "notice that this is a direct consequence of the wave nature of the mesons : the classical case of two scattering particles in one dimension - with the constraint that no double occupancy might occur in a single matter site - would necessary results only in backscattering , since the two hard classical particles can not pass through each other .",
    "we presented a detailed tensor network study on the real - time dynamics of a lattice gauge theory in the presence of dynamical charges and quantum gauge fields . within this approach",
    ", we have shown that one has direct access to all local quantities of interests - the time evolution of the mass , charge and gauge fields - and to the quantum correlation between bipartitions of the system by means of the von neumann entropy .",
    "we investigated the primary and secondary string breaking in qed in ( 1 + 1)d represented by an @xmath102 quantum link model with staggered fermions . in this context , we studied the real - time evolution of the schwinger mechanism leading to mass creation and annihilation by means of the interplay with the electric energy released by the string .",
    "we quantified key properties of these effects such as the mass production rate of the schwinger mechanism and the velocity of the electric field spreading .",
    "moreover , we unveiled the relation between string breaking dynamics and the entanglement spreading in the systems and we showed that it is possible to study scattering dynamics , characterizing not only mass and charge real - time evolution but also the creation of quantum correlations among scattered particles .",
    "finally , we showed that the presented results can be in principle verified experimentally in possible future quantum simulations , as they appear to be robust with respect to the most common sources of gauge - invariant imperfections appearing in most of the proposed implementations .",
    "this work paves the way to systematic studies of real time dynamical phenomena in abelian and non - abelian lgts in low dimensional systems .",
    "indeed , the present approach can be straightforwardly generalized to more complex lgt and geometries , e.g. , ladders or cylinders , and also can be studied in presence of an external environment by means of , for example , the tensor network approach presented in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can also study the continuum limit of the lgt ( as already discussed for wilson theories  @xcite ) : for qlms , this can either be done using dimensional reduction  @xcite , or by increasing the quantum link representation , similarly to what has been done in  @xcite .",
    "notice that the gauge invariant tensor network formulation behaves favorably as the speed - up it grants scales as the number of rishons per link squared  @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented access to the entanglement dynamics in lgts will allow investigations on the role of quantum correlations in different contexts enabling a deeper understanding of the quantum real - time dynamics of lattice gauge theories .",
    "finally , exploiting the capability to prepare a wide class of complex states granted from recent developments in quantum optimal control of many - body quantum systems  @xcite , more complex dynamics could be investigated .",
    "one example would be to perform extensive studies of the scattering at different energies .",
    "alongside , these methods can also be applied to study condensed matter systems to compute , e.g. , response functions of antiferromagnets described by lgt ( spin ices , resonating valence bond models , etc . ) which are very hard to evaluate using mc due to analytic continuation  @xcite . moreover ,",

    "the main sources of numerical error in our calculations are the finite bond dimension of the mps - state representation and the suzuki - trotter time - step . as a bond dimension we used a value up to @xmath103 , which ensures a truncation error on the corresponding wave function of maximum order @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively for the string breaking calculations , and @xmath108 for @xmath109 for the scattering processes .",

    "from the earliest discussion of the schwinger model , the screening of static charges due to vacuum polarization has attracted a lot of interest @xcite .",
    "recent semiclassical calculations have reproduced this process including also finite masses where it could be shown that the main dynamics for @xmath120 is mostly independent from the mass  @xcite . here , we show that it is possible to study such process using quantum link models implemented in a tensor network algorithm , already with very small spin representation , e.g. @xmath102 .",
    "as the screening of charges can be observed only in asymptotically large times , the large correlations building up during the process have carefully to be kept under control , otherwise they would undermine the efficiency of our approach .",
    "thus , here we limit our system size to @xmath121 lattice sites and encode the two static charges which build up the initial string in the boundary conditions on both sides of the lattice .",
    "in such a way , we avoid to simulate the vacuum regions where quantum correlations build up very quickly ( see fig .  [",

    "we stress that the goal of the presented analysis is to show that it is possible to perform a study of the screening of charges using tensor networks , not to perform a thorough discussion which will be presented elsewhere .",

    "<S> tensor network algorithms provide a suitable route for tackling real - time dependent problems in lattice gauge theories , enabling the investigation of out - of - equilibrium dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a u(1 ) lattice gauge theory in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions in the presence of dynamical matter for different mass and electric field couplings , a theory akin to quantum - electrodynamics in one - dimension , which displays string - breaking : the confining string between charges can spontaneously break during quench experiments , giving rise to charge - anticharge pairs according to the schwinger mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we study the real - time spreading of excitations in the system by means of electric field and particle fluctuations : we determine a dynamical state diagram for string breaking and quantitatively evaluate the time - scales for mass production . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the time evolution of the quantum correlations can be detected via bipartite von neumann entropies , thus demonstrating that the schwinger mechanism is tightly linked to entanglement spreading . </S>",
    "<S> to present the variety of possible applications of this simulation platform , we show how one could follow the real - time scattering processes between mesons and the creation of entanglement during scattering processes . finally , we test the quality of quantum simulations of these dynamics , quantifying the role of possible imperfections in cold atoms , trapped ions , and superconducting circuit systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate how entanglement properties can be used to deepen our understanding of basic phenomena in the real - time dynamics of gauge theories such as string breaking and collisions . </S>"
