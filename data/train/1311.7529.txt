    "ions form a quasi - wigner crystal with a small number of co - ions as impurities , and the diffusion coefficient decreases . in this case , however , there is mostly steric contribution to the activation energy , which is much lower than at pzc , and hence the diffusion in highly charged pores is much faster than at pzc .    we thus conclude that a careful examination of rtils inside nanopores precisely under charging conditions is necessary for selecting an optimal electrode / rtil pair , rather than a simple ` extrapolation ' of rtil s bulk properties .",

    "for instance , in the ionophilic pore @xmath60 of charging is achieved in @xmath61ns , while only @xmath62ns is needed in case of an ionophobic pore .",

    "thus , the ` law of effective diffusion ' is not only remarkable but also of practical importance .",
    "indeed , it can for instance help simplify the development of ` whole porous - electrode ' models , and thus open doors for optimizing electrode materials beyond single - pore level .",
    "ion s self - diffusion in sub - nanometer pores shows an interesting dependence on ion densities and composition .",
    "the self - diffusion coefficient varies during charging over a few orders of magnitude , and can exceed a few times the ion diffusion in the bulk ( under similar conditions ) .",
    "this suggests that fast charging can in principle be achieved if an ionic liquid is optimized specifically for selected porous materials and the required degree of charging .",
    "we have found that charging is often accompanied by overfilling .",
    "although overfilling can in fact accelerate charging , as demonstrated by high effective collective diffusivity , the subsequent de - filling slows down charging significantly , and shall be avoided in practical applications .",
    "one way to achieve this is to make pores ionophobic .",
    "we have shown that ionophobic pores can accelerate charging by an order of magnitude . our preliminary calculations and the recent experience with cylindrical pores  @xcite show that pore ionophobicity leads to comparable values of capacitance and enhanced energy density at moderately high voltages .",

    "md simulations were performed using a customized gromacs code.@xcite pore walls were maintained as equi - potential surfaces with their image planes coinciding with the geometric plane of wall atoms . in the method@xcite we used , the electronic polarizability of pore walls is taken into account on the continuum electrostatics level .",
    "this method is in good agreement@xcite with other models of polarizable electrodes.@xcite    the system was first equilibrated for @xmath79ns at pzc .",
    "the number of ions inside the entire system was tuned so that the ion density in the rtil reservoirs matched that of a bulk system at @xmath80k and @xmath81atm ( such an elevated temperature was chosen to ensure that the model rtil remains in the liquid phase ) .",
    "after the system reached the equilibrium , a voltage difference was impulsively imposed between the negative and positive electrodes , and the system was let evolve in the nvt ensemble for @xmath42ns . each charging case was repeated @xmath82 times , with independent initial configurations , to obtain reliable statistics . to compute the equilibrium charge at a given applied voltage , a separate system with @xmath82% shorter pores were setup and run for @xmath83ns .    to study self - diffusion of ions inside nanopores , we setup md systems which consist of a single pore only ( and the ions in it ) , with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "we tuned the number of cations and anions to match the desired total and charge densities inside the pore .",
    "since pore walls are modeled as equi - potential surface , they form a faraday cage around ions , and electroneutrality is automatically satisfied .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of ions was computed using the einstein - helfand relation@xcite ; the ion trajectories were obtained from at least @xmath4ns equilibrium runs .",

    "<S> having smaller energy density than batteries , supercapacitors have exceptional power density and cyclability . </S>",
    "<S> their energy density can be increased using ionic liquids and electrodes with sub - nanometer pores , but this tends to reduce their power density and compromise the key advantage of supercapacitors . to help address this issue through material optimization , here we unravel the mechanisms of charging sub - nanometer pores with ionic liquids using molecular simulations , navigated by a phenomenological model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that charging of ionophilic pores is a diffusive process , often accompanied by overfilling followed by de - filling . in sharp contrast to conventional expectations , charging is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an order of magnitude faster than in bulk , and charging itself is accelerated by the onset of collective modes . </S>",
    "<S> further acceleration can be achieved using ionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling / de - filling and thus leading to charging behavior qualitatively different from that in conventional , ionophilic pores . </S>"
