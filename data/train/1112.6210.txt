    ", we have a correspondance between this set of power series and the set of sequences over @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the most important results are that the output sequence is the @xmath57-adic expansion of @xmath60 which is in the fraction field of @xmath47 and @xmath61 is the connection integer . under more assumptions ,",

    "we describe this analysis in detail .",
    "note that in @xcite ( p.19 - 25 ) , klapper and xu give three examples to describe the different cases of afsr and one of them corresponds to @xmath0-vfcsr .",
    "in fact , afsr generalize lfsr , @xmath1-ary fcsr , @xmath1-ary @xmath0-fcsr , vfcsr and @xmath0-vfcsr , but the analysis of afsr is very formal and the period of an output sequence of afsr divides @xmath78 and the maximal period is @xmath78 .",
