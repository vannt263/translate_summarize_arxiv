    "their numerical results show that the tumbling can be chaotic @xcite . in order to experimentally distinguish periodic from aperiodic tumbling due to asymmetry",
    ", it is necessary to observe long sequences of flips .",
    "a confounding factor is rotational and centre - of - mass diffusion : the centre of mass of an advected rod may diffuse to neighbouring stream lines of the flow .",
    "this causes aperiodicity . but noise can also directly affect the rotational degrees of freedom , leading to random tumbling .    in order to disentangle these effects it is necessary to follow the orientational dynamics for many flips .",
    "the rods must therefore be tracked for long distances . to achieve this",
    "we have improved an existing experimental setup @xcite in two ways .",

    "the orientational dynamics is expected to retrace its trajectory upon reversal of the flow .",
    "this is a consequence of the time - reversal invariance of the stokes equation governing low reynolds - number flow .",

    "experimentally observed tumbling trajectories .",
    "first , we see periodic and aperiodic tumbling .",
    "second , different tumbling trajectories exhibit different sensitivities to external perturbations . we argue that these observations can be explained by slight asymmetries of the rods .",
    "third , at very long times initially periodic trajectories lose their phase .",
    "we attribute this to drift of the centre of mass of the rod from one to another stream line of the channel flow .",

    "based on the smallest channel dimension ( @xmath12{\\upmu m}$ ] ) this yields a reynolds number of the order of re = @xmath15 .",
    "the navier - stokes equations for the incompressible flow in the channel thus reduce to the viscous stokes equation which can be simply solved by a basis expansion . closely following @xcite we have computed the flow profile in a cross section far from the in- and outlets ( so that we can neglect the @xmath10-coordinate ) .",
    "we assume no - slip boundary conditions at the channel walls and a constant pressure gradient over the channel length . the resulting profile for our channel geometry is shown in fig .  [ fig : flowprofile_theory ] .",

    "the disturbance flow due to the the inclusion is therefore expected to obey the quasi - steady stokes equation .",
    "as explained below , the rods often tumble aperiodically . to classify different dynamical behaviours",
    "requires long time series .",
    "since one traversal of the channel takes approximately @xmath23 minutes , large amounts of data must be analysed .",
    "we have therefore designed a data analysis software ( in matlab ) to track the centre - of - mass and orientational motion of the suspended rods in an automated fashion .    the raw data from the experiment consist of time - stamped positions of the motorised stage , together with frame sequences from the microscope .",
    "the analysis uses this information to estimate time series of the centre - of - mass position of a given rod , and the orientation of the unit vector @xmath24 along its major axis : @xmath25 the coordinate system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental_setup ] .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we briefly describe how the empirical data were processed .",
    "first , we summarise our algorithm for the image analysis . second we explain how time is rescaled to account for variations in the flow velocity due to reversals of the direction of the flow and due to fluctuations in the pump pressure .",
    "the automated image - analysis software tracks the centre of mass and the orientation of a given rod as it moves in the channel .",
    "we separately discuss two steps : detecting the position and orientation of the rod , and estimating its length .",
    "_ finding the rod position and orientation_. to begin with , static image noise is removed as follows . for each pixel ,",
    "the time - averaged intensity is computed , and for each time , the average intensity of the frame is calculated .",
    "then , for each pixel , the time - averaged intensity is subtracted from the instantaneous intensity , and the instantaneous frame average is added .    to locate the rod in a given frame",
    ", the software requires an initial guess of the centre - of - mass position .",
    "the frame rate is sufficiently high so that the tracked rods move only slightly between subsequent frames .",
    "the initial guess is therefore taken to be the last - known rod position ( for the first frame , manual user input is required ) .",
    "once the location of the rod within a given frame has been estimated , a smaller window is cropped around the approximate position of the rod .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_analysisb ] .",
    "a standard implementation of the edge - detection algorithm suggested by @xcite is used to find the points on the edge of a rod sufficiently contrasted from its surroundings , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data_analysisc ] .",
    "we estimate the rod length and its orientation starting from the set of edge pixels . to this end",
    "we use least - squares fits to ellipses @xcite , because this method has proven to be less sensitive to inaccuracies in the edge detection than the commonly employed principal component analysis .",
    "these fits yield estimates of the projections of @xmath26 onto the camera plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : data_analysisd ] ) .",
    "its @xmath11-component is not directly observable , but can be computed from @xmath27 and @xmath28 if the length of the rod is known .",
    "_ estimating the rod length_. it is impossible to determine the length of the rod from the length of its projected image in a single frame .",
    "however , the rod spends a significant amount of time aligned with the flow in the @xmath10-@xmath13-plane , where the projected length corresponds to the rod length .",
    "we therefore recorded time series of projected rod lengths and computed the distribution of projected rod lengths ( fig .",
    "[ fig : length_histogram ] ) . ideally , the distribution should exhibit a sharp cut - off on its rhs , at the true length of the rod .",
    "however , we observe a small tail on the rhs of the distribution , caused by the experimental uncertainty of the order of one pixel size , or @xmath9{\\upmu m}$ ] . this uncertainty is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : length_histogram ] .",
    "we therefore estimate the rod length by the position of the maximum of the distribution .",
    "a histogram of a series of measurements of the projected rod lengths in the @xmath10-@xmath13-plane of a single rod ( rod # 1 in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the rod spends a long time nearly aligned with the flow direction .",
    "this results in the peak of the histogram .",
    "the tail to the left corresponds to observations when the rod is turning around , producing a shorter projection in the camera plane .",
    "the small tail to the right is due to the uncertainty in the measurement .",
    "the width of the tail corresponds to the size a single pixel , indicated in the figure .",
    "the peak position is taken to be the length of the rod . ]",
    "as explained above , we revert the flow direction in order to test the sensitivity of observed orientational motion to perturbations .",
    "we have found that small perturbations may have significant effects .",
    "it is therefore important to revert the flow as smoothly as possible .",
    "this means that the flow velocity changes substantially over a significant amount of time .",
    "another source of changes in flow speed @xmath29 is noise in the form of uncontrolled pressure fluctuations in the pump .",
    "but as long as the flow is governed by the linear stokes equation ( as it is in our case ) , the only effect of fluctuations of @xmath29 is a linear change of time scale . to account for this change",
    ", we plot orientational trajectories as a function of distance @xmath30 along the trajectory of the rod ( and not as a function of time @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 the instantaneous flow velocity @xmath29 is estimated by the centre - of - mass velocity .",

    "@xmath30 to @xmath34 , effectively reversing time . in an ideal and noise - free experiment",

    "consider first fig .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that the fluctuations @xmath35 of the centre - of - mass trajectory are very small , only on the order of @xmath4{\\upmu m}$ ] .",
    "this is less than one rod length , and is much smaller than the channel width ( @xmath36{\\upmu m})$ ] .",
    "panel ( b ) shows @xmath27 , the component of orientation vector along the flow direction .",
    "the rod spends most of its time aligned with the flow , but regularly tumbles between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . upon reversal , the orientational trajectory is initially similar , but drifts out of phase after several flips .",
    "the @xmath13-component of the orientation vector in panel ( c ) is , of course , close to @xmath39 while the rod is aligned along the flow .",
    "however , during a flip the values of @xmath28 determine which particular orientational path the rod takes .",
    "we see that the shape of the @xmath28-curve during flips is similar for several subsequent flips .",
    "this indicates that the orientational trajectory is approximately periodic .",
    "[ fig : result_successful2 ] shows a second example .",
    "it is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] , but corresponds to a different orientational trajectory .",
    "the other main difference is that the period time of the tumbling motion is shorter .",
    "[ fig : result_butterfly1 ] shows an orientational trajectory that exhibits large deviations after reverting the flow .",

    "figs .  [ fig : result_successful3 ] to [ fig : result_butterfly1 ] show both translational and orientational trajectories of rods advected in a channel flow .",
    "the translational trajectories indicate that the experiment is successfully controlled : the rods stay on straight streamlines during the whole experiment in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] to [ fig : result_butterfly1 ] . on a finer scale",
    "we see that the streamline followed by the centre - of - mass is slightly curved , on the order of @xmath4{\\upmu m}$ ] .",
    "this is probably due to imperfections in the channel walls .",
    "after reversal , the centre - of - mass trajectories of the rods follow the streamlines very well , with only minor fluctuations on the order of one micrometer .",
    "our main results are the orientational trajectories of the rods shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] to [ fig : result_butterfly1 ] .",
    "as expected we observe tumbling motion , and the results include both periodic tumbling ( figs .  [",

    "different realisations of the experiment result in different tumbling periods .",
    "moreover , we observe a weak phase drift between trajectories before and after reversal .",
    "we discuss these observations by first briefly recalling the hydrodynamic theory of @xcite and its implications for both axisymmetric and triaxial rods .",
    "the theory is valid when the difference in flow velocity at different ends of the rod is well approximated by the flow gradient . in our experiment",
    "this is the case because the length of the rods ( @xmath2{\\upmu m}$ ] ) is much smaller than the smallest channel dimension of @xmath12{\\upmu m}$ ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : flowprofile_theory ] ) .",
    "small axisymmetric rods suspended in a shear flow tumble periodically .",
    "more precisely , the orientation vector follows one of infinitely many possible periodic jeffery orbits .",
    "which particular orbit the rod takes is determined by its initial orientation . for most jeffery orbits , the rod tumbles : it stays aligned with the streamline for most of the time , but at times it rapidly flips by 180 degrees . when the initial orientation of the rod is very close to the vorticity direction , the tumbling is less pronounced .",
    "the corresponding type of orientational motion is often referred to as `` kayaking '' in the literature , owing to its similarity to the motion of a kayak paddle .    for jeffery orbits ,",
    "the tumbling period does not depend on the initial orientation of the rod .",
    "the period for a rod of aspect ratio @xmath40 suspended in a shear flow of strength @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 as mentioned in the introduction , asymmetric rods also tumble , but not necessarily in a periodic fashion @xcite .",
    "we begin the discussion of figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] and [ fig : result_successful2 ] by noting two consequences of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeffery_time ] ) .",
    "first , this equation shows that the different tumbling periods in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] and [ fig : result_successful2 ] can result from differences in aspect ratio or shear strength : larger aspect ratios correspond to longer periods , stronger shear to shorter periods .",
    "the lengths of the rods shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] and [ fig : result_successful2 ] are approximately the same . but the resolution of our microscope does not allow us to precisely determine the thickness of the two rods .",
    "we can not exclude that the different tumbling periods are in part caused by different aspect ratios of the two rods .",
    "second , we discuss the phase drift between the forward and backward orientational trajectories seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] and [ fig : result_successful2 ] in terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jeffery_time ] ) .",
    "we argue that the phase drift is due to fluctuations in the shear that are caused by small fluctuations of the @xmath11-coordinate of the centre - of - mass position . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental_methods ] , the shear is a function of the @xmath11-coordinate .",
    "our experimental set up does not allow us to measure fluctuations in the @xmath11-coordinate , but if we assume that the centre - of - mass drift in @xmath11 is similar in magnitude to that in @xmath13 ( on the order of a few micrometers ) , we can find a lower bound for the expected phase drift as follows . according to eq .",
    ", the period is inversely proportional to the shear strength .",
    "it follows that the relative change in shear strength equals the relative change in time between flips , @xmath43 .",
    "the flow profile in the @xmath11-direction is approximately a quadratic function , @xmath44 , which implies that @xmath45 .",
    "equating @xmath11 with the channel depth ( @xmath12{\\upmu m}$ ] ) allows us to estimate that the drift should at least be @xmath3{\\%}$ ] , in agreement with panels ( b ) and ( c ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : result_successful3 ] and [ fig : result_successful2 ] .",
    "we conclude the discussion by examining the trajectory in fig .",
    "[ fig : result_butterfly1 ] .",
    "we see , first , that the trajectory is clearly aperiodic , both before and after reversal .",
    "the numerical experiments by @xcite indicate that triaxial rods may exhibit aperiodic dynamics even for very small deviations from axisymmetry ( that could not be resolved by our microscope ) .",
    "secondly , the forward and backward orientational trajectories in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : result_butterfly1 ] separate rapidly .",
    "in fact , the trajectory appears at first to reverse perfectly but then the difference between forward and backward orientational trajectories grows substantially .",
    "these observations suggest that fig .  [",
    "fig : result_butterfly1 ] corresponds to chaotic tumbling of a triaxial particle .",
    "we have designed a microfluidic setup with video microscopy and tracking software to measure the translational and orientational trajectories of microrods advected in microchannel flows .",
