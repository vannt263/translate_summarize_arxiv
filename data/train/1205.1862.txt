    "the finite element method ( fem ) is a most popular method in solving partial differential equations , cf .",
    "@xcite . due to its local conservation property of flux ,",
    "the finite volume method ( fvm ) is also used in a wide range of computation , especially in computational fluid dynamics , cf .",
    "however , the mathematical theory on fvm ( cf . , @xcite ) has not been fully developed , at least , not as satisfactory as that for fem .",
    "low order fvm theory ( @xmath2 and some @xmath3 methods ) is well established , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "both the design and analysis on high order , symmetric fvms are still under investigation , see @xcite .    in this paper , we seek flux - conserving solutions in a completely different way .",
    "the basic idea is to do a post processing on the finite element solution so that the new solution is flux conserving elementwise . to this end",
    ", we first analyze the flux - conservation property of the finite element solution .",
    "it is shown that the order of approximation of finite element in flux is optimal , the same order as that of nodal interpolation .",
    "the order is @xmath4 for the @xmath5-th degree finite element .",
    "that is , there is no convergence in total flux when using linear ( @xmath2 ) finite element .",
    "this is also confirmed numerically , both in 2d and 3d . to overcome this shortcoming of finite element method , we correct the flux error locally on each element by bubble functions , cf . figure . in one method",
    ", we use the same order bubbles , cubic bubbles in 2d and quartic bubbles in 3d , for any order finite element method . in the second method ,",
    "we use degree-@xmath6 orthogonal bubbles for the @xmath5-th degree finite element solutions . in the latter method",
    ", the post - processed finite element solution still satisfies the original finite element equations . in both methods ,",
    "the post - processed finite element solution remains as an optimal - order solution , in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 norms .",
    "( 4.7,1)(0,.1 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 2.4,0 )    we note that the finite volume solution is flux - conserving on each dual cell , i.e. , control - volume , see the left graph in figure .",
    "however for most high - order fvm solutions , the approximate theory has not been established cf .",
    "@xcite . also , other than @xmath2 fvm for constant coefficient problems , it is not natural to derive symmetric fvm , cf . @xcite and references therein",
    "this is important for eigenvalue problems @xcite , even in dealing low order terms . on the other hand , symmetric ,",
    "high - order finite element equations are naturally defined , by the orthogonal projection in a hilbert space , @xcite .",
    "such high - order finite element equations can be solved effectively by the multigrid method or other fast solvers @xcite . at the end , we correct the finite element solutions by bubble functions , to obtain flux - conserving solutions .",
    "such a correction does not alter the value of the finite element solution on the inter - element boundary , i.e. , on vertices , edges , and triangles ( in 3d ) .",
    "the rest of manuscript is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the finite element method and analyze its flux approximation . in section 3 , we define a post - processing algorithm",
    ". we will show the flux - conserving property of the processed solution and its optimal order of convergence .",
    "in section 4 , we provide numerical examples in 2d and 3d .",
    "some remarks are made in section 5 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a bounded , polygonal domain in @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the following second - order elliptic boundary value problem @xmath11 where the boundary @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a bounded and piecewise continuous function that is bounded below : there exists a constant @xmath14 such that @xmath15 for almost all @xmath16 .",
    "we choose homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition here only for simplicity of presentation .",
    "the analysis is similar for other boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath17 be a quasi - uniform , and shape - regular simplicial _",
    "triangulation _ on the domain @xmath9 : with respect to @xmath17 , we define an order @xmath5 finite element subspace @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the space of all polynomials of degree equal to or less than @xmath5 .",
    "thus , @xmath20 . the finite element solution of and is a function @xmath21 such that @xmath22 where the bilinear form @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 and the inner product @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26    unlike the finite volume solutions , the fem solution @xmath27 in does not satisfy the following conservation law elementwise @xmath28 we will define a post - processing method next section so that the above flux - error is zero elementwise .",
    "but we will show first that the finite element solution does preserve flux locally in certain degree . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a notation @xmath29 , for  @xmath30 \" , where @xmath31 is a generic , positive constant , independent of the grid size @xmath32 , and some other parameters .",
    "that is , ",
    "@xmath33 \" means that @xmath34 can be bounded by @xmath35 multiplied by a constant which is independent of the parameters which @xmath34 and @xmath35 may depend on",
    ".    let @xmath36 solve  and @xmath27 solve .",
    "it holds that @xmath37 where the hidden constant depends only on @xmath13 and the shape - regularity of @xmath38 .    for all @xmath39 , by and the divergence theorem , @xmath40 by",
    ", the finite element solution has a local flux - error , @xmath41 since @xmath38 is a shape - regular partition , for all @xmath42 , by the trace theorem and the schwarz inequality , @xmath43 where @xmath44 . the fact that @xmath36 yields @xmath45 for all @xmath46 . by (",
    "* theorem 4.14 ) , as @xmath47 is shape - regular , we have where @xmath48 is the reference triangle or tetrahedron , see .",
    "thus , it follows that therefore , by , summing up the above inequalities for all @xmath49 and using the optimal order approximation property that the inequality follows .",
    "a similar estimate has been derived in @xcite for @xmath2 finite element solutions . in @xcite , on the dual - cell , one order higher convergence is proved for the local flux : where @xmath50 , see the left figure in figure . here @xmath51 is the barycentric - centric coordinate on @xmath47 associated with vertex @xmath52 , cf . .",
    "this is because there is a supercloseness between the @xmath2 finite element solution and the finite volume solution , and because the flux - error is identically @xmath53 on each vertex - centered control volume @xmath54 for the finite volume solution .",
    "here we give an unified estimate for element - wise fluxes of fem solutions of any order .    as a direct consequence of and , we have the following estimate for the @xmath8 norm of numerical fluxes of fem solutions .",
    "let @xmath36 solve  and @xmath27 solve .",
    "it holds that    by , combining them on all elements , we get the corollary is proved by the optimal - order projection property of the finite element solution .",
    "in this section , we present an algorithm to process the fem solution so that the flux is elementwise conserving .",
    "let the @xmath55-dimensional bubble function be @xmath56 on a triangle or tetrahedron @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath57 are the barycentric coordinates on @xmath47 .",
    "that is , @xmath58 is a linear function defined by by the divergence - theorem , noting that @xmath59 on @xmath60 except the @xmath61 vertices",
    ". the scaling argument would give    given the problem  and a finite element space .",
    "* step 1*. solve the finite element system @xmath62 to obtain the standard finite element solution @xmath21 .",
    "* step 2*. correct @xmath27 to obtain a flux - conserving solution : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is defined in and    the post - processed solution @xmath65 satisfies the local flux - conservation property , for all @xmath42 .",
    "we use the lowest - order bubble functions in algorithm , i.e. , degree-3 bubbles in 2d and degree-4 in 3d . we can use nearly any bubble in the flux - correction , even non - polynomial bubbles . in the analysis",
    "below , we only require a bubble to be zero on the boundary and to have non - zero total flux on the boundary of an element , cf . .",
    "although we use the lower order bubble , but it does not deteriorate the approximation of high order finite element . that is , for example , we can apply a degree-3 bubble correction to a 4-th degree finite element solution .",
    "we next analyze the convergence property of the flux - conserving solution @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath36 , then the flux - conserving solution @xmath66 defined in approximates @xmath67 in the optimal order , @xmath68 and @xmath69    since @xmath70 , for all @xmath42 , @xmath71 by and estimates in theorem [ th : flux ] , @xmath72 on the other hand , since @xmath39 is shape regular , @xmath73 and @xmath74 therefore , the correction part of @xmath75 is bounded by by and , similarly , by the scaling argument , @xmath76 by the triangle inequalities @xmath77 @xmath78 and the standard finite elements estimates on @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the estimates and follow .",
    "the corrected solution @xmath66 , defined by , does not satisfy the original finite element equations any more , though it remains as an optimal - order solution .",
    "we can improve the method by using high - order , orthogonal bubble functions .",
    "let be the reference triangle , i.e. , the unit right triangle at the origin .",
    "let @xmath79 such that we note that , by writing @xmath80 , there are @xmath81 degrees of freedom in constructing @xmath82 but only @xmath83 constraints in the constructions .",
    "for example , we can let where @xmath84 is defined in . by the construction ,",
    "the bubble functions are orthogonal to the finite element functions in @xmath85 , in semi-@xmath7 inner - product : where @xmath86 is a degree-@xmath5 polynomial on @xmath47 and @xmath87 is another degree-@xmath88 polynomial on @xmath89 .",
    "thus , if @xmath64 in is replaced by the above orthogonal - bubbles , then the processed finite element solution still satisfies the original equations : for all @xmath86 .",
    "here we assumed a constant coefficient @xmath90 . for variable coefficient @xmath13 , the orthogonal bubbles can be constructed element by element .",
