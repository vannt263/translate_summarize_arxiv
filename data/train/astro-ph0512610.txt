    "many important aspects of high mass star formation ( hmsf ) remain unknown or poorly known .",
    "this is caused by the much more complicated appearance of hmsf regions in comparison with their low - mass counterparts and by the relative difficulties of their studies due to larger distances , etc .",
    "therefore , detailed investigations of the structure and kinematics of hmsf cores are of great importance .",
    "for example , different models of star formation predict different density profiles in the cores and different frequency of outflow occurrence .",
    "an important question in this respect is a selection of reliable tracers of physical parameters in hmsf regions .",
    "chemical effects can seriously distort their appearance .",

    "* caselli  2002 ) ) , implying that this species depletes at higher densities compared to co , despite of the same binding energies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* berg , van broekhuizen , fraser ,  2005 ) ) .",
    "the situation is less clear in hmsf cores where the mechanisms of chemical differentiation are probably different ( e.g. not linked to molecular freeze - out ) .",

    "* pirogov , zinchenko , caselli ,  2003 ) ) maps in many cases shows striking differences between them .",
    "our further studies of dust continuum emission and other high density tracers ( hcn , hnc , hco@xmath1 , their isotopes , etc . ) reveal certain relationships between them .",
    "the details of these observations are presented elsewhere ( pirogov , in preparation , zinchenko , in preparation ) .",
    "here we summarize the main results .",
    "first , we found a good correlation between cs and dust emission in most cases . at the same time",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 distributions are frequently very different .",
    "an example of such comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g285 ] .",
    "the millimeter wave dust ( and cs ) emission peaks are also usually associated with strong fir sources ( in particular , from the iras catalogue ) .",
    "on the other hand the n@xmath0h@xmath1/cs ratio usually reaches the highest values towards clumps without such association .",
    "this behavior is opposite to that typical for cold low - mass cores .",
    "the variations of the cs / n@xmath0h@xmath1 intensity ratio reach more than an order of magnitude .",
    "it is worth noting that the n@xmath0h@xmath1 optical depth is usually small ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pirogov  2003 ) ) while the cs optical depth can be rather high .",
    "this means that the saturation effects can only decrease the apparent variations of the cs / n@xmath0h@xmath1 ratio .",
    "the behavior of other high density tracers varies from source to source but most of them are closer to cs .",
    "an exception is hnc which is an intermediate case in this sense between cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s255 ] we present as an example maps of several high density tracers in s255 overlaid on the dust continuum map .",
    "it shows two continuum peaks almost equal in intensity .",
    "the nature of these two components is different .",
    "the central one is associated with a luminous cluster of ir sources , whereas toward the northern one an ultracompact h  ii region ( g192.58 - 0.04 ) was detected .",
    "cs and hcn follow the dust distribution quite well , while n@xmath0h@xmath1 is very different . hco@xmath1 map in s255 looks similar to n@xmath0h@xmath1 but in some other sources it is closer to cs .",
    "the same can be said about ammonia .",
    "a comparison of the c@xmath3o and dust continuum data for this source shows no sign of co freeze out which suggests that the dust temperature is above 20  k , the sublimation temperature of co.    we studied variations of kinetic temperature in these sources by ch@xmath4c@xmath0h observations . in most cases",
    "no significant temperature difference between the cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 peaks was found ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* malafeev , zinchenko , pirogov ,  2005 ) ) .",
    "typical temperatures which we derived for these peaks are @xmath5  k. e.g. in s255 we found kinetic temperatures of @xmath6  k for both peaks mentioned above .",
    "therefore , the observed chemical differentiations can not be explained by molecular freeze - out as in low mass cores .",
    "density differences between the cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 peaks are also not very significant as follows from our density estimates based on cs and ch@xmath4oh lvg modelling . at the same time",
    "the gas densities at cs peaks are somewhat higher than at the n@xmath0h@xmath1 ones and in general there is a correlation between cs emission intensity and gas density .",
    "one possible explanation for the observed chemical differentiations was proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lintott , viti , rawlings ,  ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "they suggested that the enhancement of cs/@xmath7 abundance ratio may be related to the high dynamical activity in these regions which could enhance the rate of collapse of cores above the free - fall rate .",
    "consequently , high gas densities would be achieved before freeze - out had removed the molecules responsible for the @xmath7 loss , while the high densities promote cs formation .",
    "our data show that in most cases the line widths at the cs peaks are somewhat larger than at the n@xmath0h@xmath1 peaks which is consistent with this model although in s255 the reverse is true .",
    "we studied the density profiles in the cores using the molecular line and dust continuum maps . from the n@xmath0h@xmath1 data we derived the @xmath8 density profile assuming constant n@xmath0h@xmath1 excitation and abundance along the radius ( ( * ? ? ? *",
    "pirogov  2003 ) ) .",
    "however , this assumption is not justified and probably more reliable conclusions can be drawn from dust observations .",
    "the analysis of the dust continuum maps was similar .",
    "we fitted the 2d intensity distribution for nearly circular clumps with a convolution of a power law function with a gaussian beam .",
    "the details of this analysis are presented elsewhere ( pirogov , in preparation ) .",
    "an example of this fitting is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdens ] .    in total",
    ", the data for 17 clumps obtained at sest were analyzed .",
    "the power law index is @xmath9 for clumps with embedded iras point sources and @xmath10 for clumps without such sources . assuming temperature gradient in the former sources ( described by a power law index of @xmath11 ,",
    "see below ) and isothermal latter sources , this corresponds to @xmath12 density profiles for both types of clumps .",
    "such density profiles are in agreement with several other studies ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* beuther , schilke , menten ,  2002 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mueller , shirley , evans ii ,  2002 ) ) .",
    "they rule out some theoretical models ( e.g. so - called `` logatropic '' one ) but are consistent with the `` standard '' theory of star formation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shu 1977 ) ) .",
    "it is worth noting that these dependencies are obtained for _ mean _ volume densities which are derived from column densities .",
    "densities found for regions of molecular emission from excitation analysis are usually significantly higher and have different dependence on radius ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdens ] ) .",
    "this can be a consequence of small scale clumpiness in these regions .",
    "the volume filling factor should be @xmath13 .",
    "we studied the temperature distribution in the cores on the basis of high quality ch@xmath4c@xmath0h @xmath14 maps obtained at iram 30-m telescope ( the beam width at this frequency is @xmath15 ) .",
    "an example of temperature map ( for s140 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s140-tkmap ] .",
    "these maps could be deconvolved into several distinct clumps and the dependence of temperature on the projected distance from the clump center was analyzed .",
    "an example of this dependence for the main clump in s140 is also shown in fig .  [ fig : s140-tkmap ] .",
    "these dependencies were compared with model calculations of temperatures which would be derived for optically thin ch@xmath4c@xmath0h emission from a spherically symmetric cloud with a power law temperature and density gradients ( ch@xmath4c@xmath0h was assumed to be thermalized at densities @xmath16  @xmath17 ) .",
    "we found that the radial temperature dependence in these clumps can be fitted by a power law with indices between 0.3 and 0.4 .",
    "this dependence is in agreement with the theoretically expected one for a centrally heated optically thin cloud .",
    "some other recent studies found somewhat different dependencies .",
    "e.g. @xcite derived steeper temperature gradients from comparison of temperatures found from different species and at the same time argued for rather constant temperature in regions of ch@xmath4c@xmath0h emission .",
    "the results presented here do not support these conclusions .",
    "our cs and n@xmath0h@xmath1 data show that the velocity dispersion in hmsf cores either remains constant or decreases outwards ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zinchenko 1995 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lapinov , schilke , juvela ,  1998 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pirogov  2003 ) ) . a plausible explanation could be found in a higher degree of dynamical activity of gas in central regions of hmsf cores , including differential rotation , infall motions and turbulence due to winds and outflows from massive stars .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite derived an opposite trend from comparison of line widths and sizes of the emission regions for different species in the same source .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear yet .",
    "many hmsf cores mapped in n@xmath0h@xmath1 show systematic velocity gradient fields , implying nearly uniform rotation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pirogov  2003 ) ) .",
    "there is a correlation ( @xmath18 ) between direction angle of total velocity gradient and elongation angle .",
    "this fact justifies an assumption that elongation of cores and clumps could be due to rotation .",
    "however , the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy is only @xmath19 on the average , so that rotation should not play a significant role in core dynamics .    the frequency of occurrence of high velocity outflows in the studied sample was found to exceed @xmath6% using so line wings as an indicator ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zinchenko 2002 ) ) which is in agreement with other available estimates .      in several cases molecular line profiles ( especially hco@xmath1 ) show features indicative of infall motions ( red - shifted self - absorption ) .",
    "this is a case both for clumps with and without strong embedded ir sources .",
    "however , the latter ones are probably at an earlier stage of evolution , and they are characterized by a relatively high n@xmath0h@xmath1/cs ratio , as mentioned above .",
    "thus , one can speculate that this ratio can be one of the indicators of the earliest phases of massive protostars .",
    "we have shown that effects of chemical differentiation in warm massive cores are very different from those in cold low mass cores .",
    "in particular , cs is a good tracer of total mass here , while n@xmath0h@xmath1 is not .",
    "a relatively high n@xmath0h@xmath1/cs ratio can indicate the earliest phases of massive protostars .",
    "the internal structure of hmsf clumps is more or less consistent with the standard theory of star formation .",
