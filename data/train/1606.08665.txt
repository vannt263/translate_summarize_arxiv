    "with the recent operation of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern the opportunity to study the bose  einstein correlations ( bec ) of identical bosons at very high hadron - hadron collision energy has been opened @xcite .",
    "in particular the energy dependence of the bec dimension @xmath7 has recently been investigated and was found to increase with log@xmath8 both in proton - proton ( @xmath2 ) and in heavy ion ( @xmath9 ) collisions @xcite . in the present work we investigate the energy behavior of the chaoticity parameter @xmath1 in @xmath2 collisions which determines the strength of the measured bec effect . to this end",
    "we utilize the relation between the bec dimension @xmath7 , the number of pion source clusters and @xmath1 .",
    "we further stipulate that the pion source clusters are proportional to the average charged particle multiplicity produced in the hadron reactions .",
    "+ the bec is measured in terms of the two identical particle correlation function @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the 4-momenta of the two hadrons , @xmath13 is the two particle density function and @xmath14 is the two particle density function in the absence of the bec effect .",
    "this @xmath14 is often referred to as the reference sample against which the bec is measured .",
    "there are several ways to construct @xmath14 which were adopted by the different bec experiments @xcite . these and the different background conditions and the variety of bec analysis methods should be appraised when their physics implications are determined . throughout this work",
    "we assume that the bec background is well accounted for and that one can safely ignore the influence of the long range correlations on the @xmath1 properties .",
    "among the various bec representations one of the frequently used in the one dimension ( 1d ) analysis of hadrons emerging from a sphere volume , is the goldhaber parametrization of a static gaussian source in the plane - wave approach @xcite , namely @xmath15 which assumes for the particles emitter a spherical volume with a radial gaussian distribution .",
    "the second often used parametrization , which assumes a radial lorentzian distribution of the source , is given by @xmath16 which generally was found at low @xmath17 values , e.g. @xmath18 gev , to fit beter the measured bec distribution than the the gaussian parametrization @xcite . in both representations @xmath19 is the difference squared of the 4-momentum vectors of the two correlated identical bosons .",
    "the @xmath1 factor , also known as the chaoticity parameter , lies in the range between 0 and 1 .",
    "+ in the 1d analysis the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 dimensions can be evaluated from the requirement that the first @xmath17 moment in a given bec distribution will be equal whether it is treated by a fit to a gaussian distribution or to an exponential one , namely @xmath22 this relation remains essentially the same as long as the upper integration value is higher than 2 gev .",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on the lower integration limit @xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "[ qmin ] . in the case that @xmath25 gev",
    "one obtains the known relation @xmath26    a relation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 can in principle be estimated by considering the relations @xmath29 where in the range between @xmath24 and @xmath30 gev the gaussian and the exponential bec parametrizations fit equally well the measured @xmath17 distribution . in this case for the values of @xmath25 and @xmath31 gev one finds that @xmath32    experimentally it has been found that the chaoticity parameter depends on several of the data properties such as the average particle pair transverse momentum , @xmath33 , and in particular on the outgoing charged particle multiplicity @xmath34 .",
    "hence the additional division of the experimental measured @xmath1 data into different categories is advisable before attempting a meaningful comparison with a model prediction .",
    "for this reason we have here , unlike in a former preliminary study @xcite , considered two distinct @xmath2 collision data sample , the first without any multiplicity restrictions labeled by mb ( minimum - bias events ) and the second the high multiplicity events , labeled by hm .",
    "the measured values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the measured ratios @xmath37 , evaluated from table [ table1 ] , are significantly different from that of @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ lamratio ] ) as they are lying in the neighborhood of the value 2 .",
    "the relation between the parameter pairs @xmath39 and @xmath40 obtained in bec fits to the measured @xmath17 distributions are studied in some details in ref .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath37 obtained ratios are matched much better to the measured ones inferred from table [ table1 ] .",
    "it has been shown that in the 1d bec there exists a relation between the dimensions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of independent similar emitting pion source clusters @xcite , namely @xmath44 which relates the one sources dimension @xmath45 at low energies with its value @xmath46 for @xmath43 identical cluster of sources .",
    "the @xmath47 and @xmath48 parameters are the chaoticity values respectively for @xmath49 and @xmath43 clusters . since we limit ourselves to the study of the behavior of the chaoticity parameter with energy it is sufficient to evaluate the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "recently the one dimension @xmath7 dependence on the @xmath2 collision center of mass energy energy was observed to increase from low energies of less than 100 gev to those reached by the lhc at 7 tev .",
    "this rise was fitted @xcite to yield @xmath51 where @xmath52 is in tev@xmath53 units and @xmath54 tev@xmath53 .",

    "it should be noted that the alice results at @xmath61 tev @xcite , which are outside the boundary of the figures are quite different from those of the atlas experiment @xcite and also are far from being part of the general pattern of the @xmath62 energy dependence .    to evaluate the @xmath27 dependence on energy we follow the formalism outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite where the hadron - hadron collisions is contributed by two components .",
    "the first is the `` hard '' component , with a contribution fraction @xmath63 , which is due to the number of binary collisions @xmath64 , and the remaining @xmath65 fraction originates from the number of participants @xmath66 referred to as the `` soft '' processes . in the case of @xmath2 collisions",
