    "it is beyond doubt that the relativistic effects are important in condensed matter physics : they are present in various systems .",
    "but until recently , not so much investigation for relativistic effects in the phenomena of superconductivity were performed , except for taking into account the spin - orbit coupling  [ 1 ] .",
    "recently , the papers of capelle et al . appeared , in which the necessity of the relativistic treatment for superconductivity in condensed matter was asserted  [ 2@xmath04 ] . in the study of the superconductivity under strong relativistic effects , they argued the necessity of the full relativistic treatment , beyond that of making small corrections like the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "they introduced the dirac - type bogoliubov - de gennes theory and discussed some new aspects of the relativistic superconductivity .",
    "based upon their works , we try to generalize their methods in this paper .",
    "in part i of this paper , we developed the formalism of the bcs and generalized bcs superconductivity in relativistic quantum field theory  [ 5 ] . by using the gorkov formalism , we derived various types of gap equations .",
    "we also gave the group - theoretical consideration of the pairing gap functions .",
    "we treated not only the spin singlet pairing states , but also the spin triplet finite angular momentum pairing states by introducing the relativistic generalized - bcs scheme .",
    "we try now to complete our program and work out the numerical study of the gap equations for various cases , by using the formalism developed in part i. to examine the relativistic effects on the gap function , thermodynamics and electromagnetic response , we have to study various cases by performing numerical calculations . in sec .",
    "ii , we examine the excitation energy spectra of quasiparticles in the relativistic theory",
    ". this examination will be useful for investigation and interpretation of the relativistic gap equations and the thermodynamics of the superconductor . in sec .",
    "iii , we solve various types of gap equations , given in part i of this paper .",
    "we consider not only the situation of the usual solid metal , but also other situations where the system has a larger fermi energy .",
    "_ by studying these systems , we depict the strength of the relativistic effects on the gap equations under an unified perspective . _ because we choose the theoretical framework as the bcs and generalized bcs theory , we can materialize it . in sec .",
    "iv , the thermodynamics and the meissner effect in the relativistic bcs and generalized bcs superconductivity are discussed . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we give a summary of the present investigation and provide further possible extensions to be studied for the pairing properties of matter .",
    "in this section , we examine the excitation energy spectra of the quasiparticles , and the density of states ( dos ) . especially we concentrate on the scalar and vector pairings , @xmath1 and @xmath2  [ 5 ] .",
    "as discussed in part i  [ 5 ] , the pairing gap function @xmath3 is decomposed by 16-dimensional complete set of @xmath4 matrices . after constructing the gap equation for each component of them , we found the fact that , only @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 ( the spacelike components of axial vector pairing ) and @xmath6 ( the axial - vector - like components of the two - rank antisymmetric tensor pairing ) can have nontrivial solutions . under the treatment given in part i , in all the cases of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the energy spectra of the quasiparticles of these states take the similar forms with that of @xmath1 or @xmath2 , except the differences about the angular dependences of the gap functions in momentum space",
    "thus , we regard the energy spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as having the typical character of the quasiparticles in the relativistic bcs and generalized bcs theory .",
    "first , we give the excitation energy spectra of the quasiparticles of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states schematically in fig . 1 .",
    "@xmath7 is the branch of the quasiparticles coming from positive ( negative ) energy states .",
    "the explicit forms are given as @xmath8 for the scalar pairing  [ 2,5 ] , and @xmath9 for the 0th component of the vector pairing  [ 5 ] .",
    "we consider first the spectrum @xmath10 . in the case of @xmath1",
    ", the minimum is found at @xmath11 ( throughout this paper , we take the approximation to set @xmath12 . this is the case for zero temperature .",
    "we completely neglect the temperature dependence of @xmath13 and use it as a simple parameter to give the particle density of a system . ) , and the energy gap is given by the width @xmath14 , same as the usual nonrelativistic case .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of @xmath2 , the minimum is found at @xmath15 , and the gap width becomes @xmath16 .",
    "the gap exists also at @xmath17 , but particles feel smaller gap at @xmath18 .",
    "usually @xmath19 , and therefore the gap width becomes @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 ( like the case of usual solid metal ) , the gap width becomes nearly @xmath22 . in this case , the spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 almost coincide with each other .",
    "it is also the case that , when @xmath23 becomes large , the difference of the spectra between @xmath1 and @xmath2 becomes large .",
    "futher , it is clear from the above discussion , if we treat the massless case , the gap will vanish in the @xmath2 state .",
    "the branch of @xmath24 is located above @xmath10 in both cases . when @xmath21 , the relative difference between @xmath10 and @xmath24 is large compared with the fermi energy , @xmath25 ( which gives the characteristic energy scale of a system ) .",
    "hence , the contribution of the quasiparticles of @xmath24 becomes small or can be neglected . on the other hand , when @xmath26 ( like the relativistic plasma ) , the contribution of @xmath24 would become large , and we should take @xmath24 into consideration for the pairing properties .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) is estimated by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dos of the superconducting state , while @xmath29 is the dos of the normal state at the fermi energy ; @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "here we only take into account the contribution of the branch @xmath10 .",
    "2 schematically depicts the dos for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states . in the case of @xmath1",
    ", @xmath28 approaches to infinity at @xmath32 , while in @xmath2 state , @xmath28 becomes infinity at @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath34 , the quasiparticles in the @xmath2 state is more easily excited than that of the @xmath1 state .",
    "in this section , we discuss the numerical solutions of the gap equations . in the numerical calculations , we should not use the approximation which is usually used in the condensed matter theory : @xmath35 rather , we have to treat the details of the energy spectra in the integration of the gap equation in order to compare the relativistic and nonrelativistic cases .",
    "furthermore , we have to introduce a cutoff to make the integral of the gap equation finite due to the use of the @xmath36-function expression for the interaction for simplicity  [ 5 ] .",
    "we take the energy cutoff @xmath37 in the following way : @xmath38 as discussed in part i , the aim of this work is to study the relativistic bcs and generalized bcs theory . for this aim , we set aside the question of the mechanism of the origin of the superconductivity .",
    "this is the attitude of the bcs and generalized bcs theory . due to this attitude",
    ", we can study the relativistic superconductivity of various systems in an unified approach , from the usual solid to the stellar matter .",
    "therefore , we treat the cutoff in a general way . in the electron - phonon interaction ,",
    "we only treat a thin shell near the fermi surface .",
    "since we skip the question about the origin of the attractive interaction , we can extend the width of integration as @xmath39 , based on the discussion of the textbook of vollhardt and wlfle  [ 6 ] , chapter 3 . here",
    "@xmath40 ( @xmath41 ; the quasiparticle lifetime of the fermi liquid ) , while @xmath42 means the fermi temperature .",
    "we integrate the states of the inside and outside of the fermi sphere symmetrically , with moving the cutoff @xmath37 in this range .",
    "then , the gap equation generally has the cutoff @xmath37 , coupling constant @xmath43 , fermion mass @xmath44 , chemical potential @xmath13 and temperature @xmath45 as the parameters of the model .",
    "our gap equations have five parameters .",
    "therefore , there is a large arbitrariness to choose these values . in this work",
    ", we mainly investigate the relativistic effects in superconductivities of several physical systems .",
    "to determine the conditions of solving the gap equations , we present the typical order of physical quantities of several systems , in table i. in this table , we consider 5 examples : ( i ) the usual solid metal ( metallic elements , alloys , compounds , oxides and organic metals )  [ 7,8 ] , ( ii ) the metallic hydrogen  [ 8,9,10 ] , ( iii ) to depict the strength of relativistic effects in heavy elements , we introduce an imaginary system of electron gas , in which @xmath46 is almost same as the kinetic energy of @xmath47-electron of uranium atom , ( iv ) the relativistic plasma  [ 11 ] and ( v ) the neutron star  [ 12 ] .",
    "to estimate the fermi energy @xmath48 of the systems , we use the nonrelativistic energy - momentum relation @xmath49 for the cases of ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( v ) , while we use the relativistic energy - momentum relation @xmath50 for the cases of ( iii ) and ( iv ) . for (",
    "ii ) , the value of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ; mean particle distance , @xmath53 ; the bohr radius ) takes the range of @xmath54  [ 9,10 ] .",
    "based on the paper of ichimaru  [ 10 ] , the electron system is relativistic at @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( at @xmath57 , @xmath58ev and @xmath59 ) . for ( iii ) ,",
    "we take the mean radius of @xmath47-electron as @xmath60 cm  [ 13 ] , and estimate the particle density by @xmath61 . in this case , we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "it is known that the relativistic effect ( kinetic energy effect ) enhances the screening , and the screening length takes a finite value at @xmath63 , while the nonrelativistic thomas - fermi length diverges in the same limit  [ 10,14 ] .",
    "therefore , we shall consider the superconductivity in such high density matter , with an assumption of existence of some effective attractive interaction .",
    "consulting with table i , we put the values of @xmath48 to @xmath13 in the gap equations .",
    "commonly , the magnitude of the gap is much smaller than @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in usual solid metal , the ratio @xmath64 becomes @xmath65 .",
    "hence , we search the values of our parameters , especially @xmath43 and @xmath37 , to satisfy this condition in solving the gap equations . after choosing the values of the parameters , the integration in the gap equation is performed , and search the self - consistency condition under the variation with respect to the amplitude of the gap .",
    "for the integration , we used the numerical package _",
    "version 4.1 .",
    "usually , this package gives high numerical accuracy .",
    "first , we treat the spin singlet pairing states .",
    "we take the cases of @xmath1 ( scalar ): @xmath66 @xmath2 ( 0th component of vector ): @xmath67 `` no - sea '' ( neglect the contribution from the negative energy states in @xmath1 ): @xmath68 and `` nonrelativistic '' ( substitute @xmath69 to `` no - sea '' ): @xmath70 therefore , we treat these 4-cases of the gap equations for comparison .    fig .",
    "3 gives the gap functions at @xmath71 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "here we take the cutoff @xmath37 such that the integration is performed over the inside and the outside of the fermi sphere symmetrically ; @xmath73 . in the case of the solid , the solutions obtained from these 4-types of gap equations discussed above",
    "coincide with each other very well . in this case , the relativistic effect is negligible at least in the gap function .",
    "there is no contribution of the quasiparticles coming from the negative energy states .",
    "in fact , the gap equations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 8) almost coincide in the limit @xmath21 with @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the relativistic plasma , there are large differences between these 4 solutions .",
    "@xmath1 gives the largest gap , while @xmath2 is strongly suppressed and becomes the smallest gap .",
    "the gap of the `` nonrelativistic '' case is also largely reduced compared with @xmath1 .",
    "the difference of @xmath1 and `` no - sea '' is also clear . at @xmath75mev@xmath76 ,",
    "the relative ratios are 105 for @xmath1/``nonrelativsitic '' and 81.4 for `` no - sea''/``nonrelativistic '' .",
    "therefore , in the relativistic plasma , we have to introduce the relativistic treatment , and can not neglect the contribution of the negative energy states .",
    "for the case of the neutron star , the solutions of the 4-cases are close from each other .",
    "but we observe small differences between them . at @xmath77mev@xmath76 ,",
    "the relative ratios are 1.16 for @xmath1/``nonrelativistic '' , and 1.15 for `` no - sea''/``nonrelativistic '' .",
    "this indicates that the contribution of the negative energy states to the gap function is less than 1 percent in this case .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "3 , the solutions reflect the nonperturbative effect and behave almost @xmath78 in all cases .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show the dependence of the cutoff @xmath37 , namely the integration width , in the solutions of 4-cases at @xmath71 . here , @xmath79 . we squeeze the width to a small region containing fermi surface . at @xmath73",
    ", we integrate all the inner region of the fermi sphere and outer region symmetrically .",
    "same as in fig .",
    "3 , the solutions of the 4-cases coincide very well in the case of the solid , and @xmath80 is always retained . in the cases of the relativistic plasma ,",
    "when we squeeze the cutoff , the gaps of @xmath1 and `` no - sea '' come close to each other .",
    "but the relative ratio between @xmath1 and `` nonrelativistic '' still remains large .",
    "we also observe that in the case of the neutron star , the solutions of the 4-cases come close to each other when we squeeze the cutoff . in all cases ,",
    "the solutions almost linearly depend on @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the solutions behave almost @xmath82 ( like the nonrelativistic bcs theory  [ 8,15,16 ] ) in 4-cases of various systems .    in figs . 3 and 4 ,",
    "the values of @xmath83 are given almost in the same range .",
    "from the results of figs . 3 and 4 , we find the values of @xmath72 and @xmath37 to provide reasonable magnitude of the gap , and then we solve the @xmath45-dependent gap equations .",
    "5 gives the temperature @xmath45 dependences of the solutions in the 4-cases .",
    "for the solid , the solutions of the 4-cases almost coincide .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath84 of fig .",
    "5(a ) is 20.7 k. the case of metallic hydrogen ( here we take @xmath85 ) , we find a tiny difference between @xmath1 and `` nonrelativistic '' cases , and @xmath86750 k. in the case of the relativistic plasma , @xmath2 and `` nonrelativistic '' are largely reduced .",
    "the difference of @xmath1 and `` no - sea '' is also large .",
    "@xmath84 of @xmath1 is 0.0820 mev = 9.5@xmath8710@xmath88 k. this @xmath84 is 0.16 times the electron rest mass . for the neutron star , @xmath84 of fig .",
    "5 for @xmath1 is 1.86 mev , while 1.71 mev for the nonrelativistic case ; thus the magnitude of the relativistic effect is less than 10 percent .",
    "next , to describe our numerical results of the singlet states of various electron systems in an unified manner , we solve the gap equations with very fine variation of the chemical potential .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath72 is determined so as to provide the ratio @xmath89 in the solution of the `` nonrelativistic '' case obtained from eq .",
    "the cutoff is always set as @xmath73 . by using these values for @xmath72",
    ", we solve the gap equations ( 6 ) , ( 8) , ( 10 ) and ( 12 ) , and obtain the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the deviations from `` nonrelativistic '' give the relativistic effects .",
    "the relativistic effects become significant for @xmath90kev in both quantities . at @xmath91mev , @xmath84 for @xmath1 case",
    "becomes 0.077 times the electron rest mass .",
    "we obtain an important result that , by using the data in fig .",
    "6 , the bcs universal constant @xmath92=1.76  [ 8,15,16 ] is almost completely filled in @xmath1 , `` no - sea '' and `` nonrelativistic '' in all @xmath23 , while discrepancies are obtained at @xmath93kev for @xmath2 state .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath1 , `` no - sea '' and `` nonrelativistic '' cases obey the bcs - like temperature dependence in all situations .    from the above results ,",
    "we conclude that if the chemical potential @xmath13 is large enough , generally the gaps of the @xmath1 case and `` no - sea '' are larger than that of the nonrelativistic case , and @xmath84 also becomes higher . especially in the case",
    "when the attractive interaction requires the treatment covering the wide range of inner and outer regions of the fermi sphere , those relative differences become significant .",
    "it is well known that , the dos of the relativistic theory in normal state @xmath94 is larger than that of the nonrelativistic one @xmath95 .",
    "this fact also contributes to enhance the solutions of the relativistic gap equations as compared with nonrelativistic counterpart .",
    "the relative difference between the `` no - sea '' and `` nonrelativistic '' cases has its origin in this effect .",
    "we expect from the relative relation among the magnitudes of the gap , the condensation energy , the lowering of the free energy and the thermodynamic critical magnetic field become larger in the relativistic case than in the nonrelativistic case . when @xmath96 ( like the usual solid metal ) , we can not distinguish @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in such a case , the presence of the @xmath2 state is `` hidden '' .",
    "but actually , @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be mixed under @xmath97 rotational symmetry ( as discussed in part i of this paper ) .",
    "the reason of the relation @xmath98 in all @xmath13 is understood in the following way .",
    "based on sec .",
    "iii of part i , each mean field is given as follows : @xmath99 here , @xmath45 means the transposition of a matrix .",
    "in the standard representation , @xmath100 is given as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the large component , while @xmath103 is the small component .",
    "thus , from the relations of ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , we obtain @xmath104 here @xmath105 expresses the spin singlet pairings clearly . at @xmath106 ,",
    "the small component vanishes , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 coincide . on the other hand , when @xmath107 and the kinetic energy becomes large , @xmath102 and @xmath103 approach to the same limit ( when @xmath108 , they coinside with each other ) , then the difference between the magnitudes of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 becomes large .",
    "( we can choose the phase @xmath109 in @xmath110 and @xmath111 . )    in this work , we do not present the results of the massless case and/or ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "we mention , however , for the case of @xmath2 , we obtain an unphysical result at @xmath112 ; two solutions appear in our numerical calculation .",
    "next we give the results for the spin triplet gap equations in fig .",
    "we solve our gap equations , given in ( 114)@xmath0(117 ) with table i of part i , under the 3 conditions : ( a ) the usual solid metal , ( b ) the relativistic plasma and ( c ) the neutron star . in all these cases , at @xmath71 , the largest solutions are obtained for the @xmath113 state of @xmath6 .",
    "this state is regarded as the balian - werthamer ( bw ) state  [ 6,8,17 ] in our theory , as discussed in part i of this paper  [ 5 ] .",
    "thus our theory also predicts that the bw state is the most important state , like the nonrelativistic theory .",
    "the @xmath114 state of @xmath5 ( the anderson - brinkman - morel ( abm ) state  [ 6,8,18 ] in our theory  [ 5 ] ) gives smaller solutions than that of the bw state at @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath84 of the bw , abm and @xmath115 of @xmath5 coincide very well .",
    "in all 3 conditions given above ( ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) , the values of @xmath92 are 6.25 for the bw , while 5.87 for the abm .",
    "especially for the case of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , their relations to each other in the gap equations are the same as that for @xmath1 and @xmath2 except for the coefficients .",
    "therefore , to interprete the results of the spin triplet gap equations , we can use the main results of the spin singlet states .",
    "we can conclude that , when @xmath96 , the solutions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the same @xmath118 will coincide very well .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath107 , the cases of the transversal states of @xmath5 and the longitudinal states of @xmath6 remain important states ; the solutions of other cases given in part i will be strongly suppressed and become unimportant .",
    "thus we recognize the fact that , in the relativistic theory , the relative orientation between the spin vector and momentum vector ( it is given by the helicity of the cooper pair , as discussed in part i ) determine the magnitude of the stabilization of the superconductivity . under the variation of parameters ( @xmath119 , @xmath37 and @xmath13 ) of the gap equations , the transversal states of @xmath5 and the longitudinal states of @xmath6",
    "behave like @xmath1 , while other cases given in part i behave like @xmath2 .",
    "it is also the case that , in the cases of @xmath120 pairings , the solution of their states becomes relatively much smaller than those of the bw and abm states .",
    "these results come from the fact that the basis @xmath121 for expanding these states has components which do not couple with p - wave interaction @xmath122 , because of the orthogonality coming from the azimuthal angular dependence .",
    "if we extend our theory to include f - wave components in the pairing interaction , these situations may become different .    to summarize the numerical results of this section",
    ", we would like to mention that it is impossible to remove the arbitrariness of the choice of the values of the model parameters completely .",
    "especially , the magnitudes of the solutions of the gap equations are sensitive to the coupling constants and the cutoff parameters . therefore in our work",
    ", we can only discuss the characteristic features of the physics of the relativistic bcs superconductivity .",
    "we assert , however , that the various qualitative features we have obtained are true and we have to keep in mind the importance of the relativistic effects in some situations discussed above . in such situations , the results obtained here should be considered seriously .",
    "in this section , we discuss the thermodynamics , especially the specific heat and spin paramagnetic susceptibility , and the meissner effect .",
    "first , we consider the specific heat of the superconducting state .",
    "it is well - known in the nonrelativistic theory  [ 6,8,19 ] that the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath123 at @xmath124 is determined by the dos at the fermi surface .",
    "the dos of the fermi surface is reflected by the node structure of the gap function .",
    "if the gap has no node , the specific heat depends exponentially on @xmath45 ( like the usual bcs or the bw state ) , while @xmath125 for the case when the gap vanishes at a line ( the polar state ) and @xmath126 for the case when the gap vanishes at two points ( the abm state ) . to estimate the @xmath45-dependence of the specific heat in the relativistic theory , we use the next formula : @xmath127 ( for all the details of the derivation , see appendix a )",
    "thus , @xmath123 is determined by dos , @xmath45 , @xmath10 , @xmath24 and the derivatives of the fermi distribution functions .",
    "the second term is usually negligible .",
    "when @xmath128 , the excitation spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 almost coincide . on the other hand , when @xmath13 becomes large , the difference between the excitation spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath2 becomes significant , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii . in such a case ,",
    "the quasipaticles are more easily excited in the @xmath2 pairing than in the @xmath1 pairing .",
    "but in this situation , @xmath2 becomes unimportant , because in such a case , the solution of the gap equation of the @xmath2 becomes small compared with @xmath1 , `` no sea '' , `` nonrelativistic '' , as discussed in sec .",
    "therefore , the effect of the difference in the excitation spectra of the radial direction in @xmath129-space ( like the difference of @xmath10 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) does not affect the thermodynamics seriously .",
    "we conclude that , in the relativistic theory , we can also estimate the @xmath45-dependence of the specific heat by the node structure of the gap",
    ". therefore , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , bw and @xmath115 of @xmath5 of our theory have the exponential dependence , while the abm state of our theory has @xmath130-dependence . in our theory , there is no state which has the polar state like node structure ( see , part i of this paper ) .",
    "next , we consider the spin paramagnetic susceptibility . here",
    "we only consider @xmath1 , @xmath2 and `` nonrelativistic '' cases ; the spin singlet states .",
    "we introduce the zeeman energy for a weak homogeneous external magnetic field , and employ the usual treatment , obtaining the magnetization @xmath131+[f(e_{-}+\\mu_{b}h)-f(e_{-}-\\mu_{b}h)]\\biggr\\}.",
    "\\nonumber \\\\   & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this , the spin paramagnetic susceptibility becomes @xmath132 here the second term is negligible .",
    "when we neglect this term , the difference of @xmath1 and `` nonrelativistic '' is only the dos . from this observation ,",
    "we suppose there is no qualitative difference in the @xmath45-dependences in @xmath1 and `` nonrelativistic '' cases .",
    "when @xmath107 , the dos enhances @xmath133 of @xmath1 , but the gap also becomes large compared with that of the `` nonrelativistic '' pairing , and thermal excitation becomes more difficult in @xmath1 than in `` nonrelativistic '' .",
    "in this situation , @xmath134 is largely reduced and the @xmath2 state becomes unimportant ( as discussed in sec .",
    "iii ) . to retain the comparison of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and `` nonrelativistic '' meaningful",
    ", we have to take @xmath23 small enough or a moderate value . in such situations ( the usual solid metal , metallic hydrogen and neutron star ) , the dos and @xmath10 of them are almost same values .",
    "in fact , we obtain numerical results that , in such situations , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and `` nonrelativistic '' cases give the same @xmath45-dependences for @xmath133 , and behave like the usual yosida function  [ 8,20 ] .",
    "we also confirm in our numerical calculation , at large @xmath13 ( relativistic plasma ) , the @xmath133 of @xmath1 also behaves like the yosida function ( at large @xmath23 , it is needless to consider the @xmath2 state ) , and the second term in ( 21 ) is completely negligible .    strictly speaking , the treatment given above is not completely a relativistic one , because the zeeman energy is a first - order term in @xmath135 ( here @xmath136 is the velocity of light ) . here , we only want to see the effect of the magnetic field in the simple method , which is usually used in the nonrelativistic theory . to compensate this incompleteness",
    ", we calculate the electromagnetic response function , and examine the meissner effect , especially for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states .",
    "the derivation of the response function is given in appendix b. we find , at a small or a moderate value of @xmath23 ( the usual solid metal , metallic hydrogen and neutron star ) , the @xmath45-dependence of the numerical integrals of ( b17 ) become almost @xmath137 in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , similar to the behavior of the response in the nonrelativistic theory  [ 16 ] .",
    "this behavior is found also for the case of large @xmath23 ( the relativistic plasma ) for @xmath1 pairing .    in summary , we conclude that , in the @xmath45-dependence of several thermodynamic quantities and meissner effect , there is no qualitative difference between the relativistic bcs theory and nonrelativistic bcs theory in homogeneous systems .",
    "therefore , we can safely use the basic concepts they are used in conventional nonrelativistic bcs and generalized bcs theory of superconductivity , for qualitative understanding of several thermodynamics and meissner effect in various systems , from the usual solid metal to the stellar matter .",
    "this fact is not clear before our work is done .",
    "in part i and part ii of this paper , we have performed the investigation of the bcs and generalized bcs superconductivity in relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "after the preparation of the gorkov equation and the group theoretical consideration of the pairing gap functions , we have solved the gorkov equations under the conditions which are assumed to have specific types of the pairing gap functions .",
    "after that , we have constructed various types of gap equations , and have solved them numerically .",
    "we have discussed the results in detail .",
    "the thermodynamic functions , especially the specific heat and the spin susceptibility were discussed .",
    "finally we have examined the meissner effect in our theory .",
    "we have obtained and examined various characteristic features of the relativistic bcs and generalized superconductivity throughout this paper .    in part ii , we have mainly investigated the kinetic energy effect of the homogenous systems in the relativistic superconductivity .",
    "this effect clearly appears in the gap equations of several situations . on the other hand , the works of capelle et al .",
    "[ 2@xmath04 ] treated the systems under deep periodic potentials .",
    "they considered the inhomogeneous effect in the relativistic superconductivity , and new physics they have obtained are based essentially on this effect .",
    "now we discuss further possible extensions . in the case of the vector @xmath5 or tensor @xmath6 pairings ,",
    "we have treated only the unitary cases .",
    "these treatments should be extended to study the case of nonunitary states , to solve the gorkov equations and to obtain gap equations . in the case of nonunitary state",
    ", time reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "we are interested in the several physical properties of the nonunitary states , as recently discussed in a nonrelativistic theory  [ 21 ] .",
    "the investigation of the collective modes is also interesting in our theory .",
    "we have introduced new mean fields for pairings , and therefore they may have collective modes which have not been known yet .",
    "for example , various collective modes in the bw and abm states were studied in detail in nonrelativistic theory  [ 6,8,22@xmath024 ] .",
    "it is interesting to study how these modes are modified under the relativistic effects .",
    "extension of our theory to the eliashberg formalism ( strong coupling theory )  [ 25 ] is an important theme .",
    "we should study how the retardation of the pairing interaction modifies our results . in the context of the relativistic theory , inclusion of the coulomb interaction ( and/or the photon - mediated interaction )",
    "is also interesting .",
    "we have obtained the green s functions of the relativistic superconductivity in this paper , with which we gain the abilities to investigate various physical properties .",
    "the problems given above may be treated by our green s functions .",
    "these investigations demand us of preparation of the next stage , which is outside of this paper .",
    "the author would like to thank profs .",
    "h. akai , k. higashijima , y. hosotani , k. ishikawa , y. nambu , h. toki and k. yamaguchi for many valuable suggestions .",
    "we write down the thermodynamic potential ( in unit volume ) in our theory : @xmath138 where the first term gives the normal state thermodynamic potential at @xmath71 , the second term gives the condensation energy at @xmath71 , and the third term gives the contribution of the bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "the entropy is given by @xmath139 this is the formula for the entropy of quasiparticle ideal gas . here , @xmath140 is the fermi distribution function for the bogoliubov quasiparticles : @xmath141 at @xmath142 , eq .",
    "( a2 ) gives the entropy for the normal state .",
    "this indicates a second - order phase transition .",
    "we yield the formula for the specific heat in the relativistic theory : @xmath143 futhermore , at @xmath124 , the gap function satisfies the condition @xmath144 , and therefore @xmath145 .",
    "we intend to study the temperature dependence of the heat capacity at @xmath124 .",
    "hence , we use a formula which neglects the temperature dependence of the gap function .",
    "therefore , we obtain ( 19 ) in sec .",
    "our starting point is the gorkov equation under the presence of an external field , ( 13 ) of part i  [ 16,26,27 ] . in this equation , we regard @xmath146 as a perturbation , and see the variation in the one - particle propagator in the first order . we decompose green s functions as @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and put them into the gorkov equation , retaining only the first order terms . here",
    "@xmath150 indicates the 0th order , the part which satisfies the gorkov equation with no external field , while @xmath151 indicates the variation with respect to the external field . due to the choice of the coulomb gauge",
    ", we assume that the mean field is rigid under the external field  [ 26 ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath152 @xmath153 and write it in the form of the dyson - type integral equation , @xmath154 @xmath155 we take the first order variation , for example for @xmath156 : @xmath157 the induced current now becomes @xmath158 we obtain the polarization function as @xmath159 this is given in the fourier transform as @xmath160 following the same way , we obtain formulae in the matsubara formalism .",
    "the induced current becomes @xmath161 the polarization becomes @xmath162 and in the fourier transform @xmath163 hereafter we use only the matsubara formalism .    in the gauge invariant theory ,",
    "the transversal condition for the polarization , @xmath164 , comes from the current conservation . in the case of zero temperature quantum field theory for the vacuum , from the lorentz invariance",
    ", it takes the form @xmath165 , which represents the 4-dimensinal transversality . in our case , the system is under finite - temperature and finite - density .",
    "we take a specific coordinate for the imaginary time and select a suitable rest frame for the description of the system . then in our case ,",
    "the lorentz invariance is lost .",
    "only @xmath97 rotational invariance in @xmath129-space remains .",
    "then we use the following projection operator ( here @xmath166 )  [ 28 ] : @xmath167 and from @xmath168 , we derive a 3-dimensional transversal condition , and then @xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 is for the 3-dimensional transversal condition , while @xmath172 is the 3-dimensional longitudinal condition , and each of them satisfies @xmath173 . using them , we obtain @xmath174 next we choose the coulomb gauge @xmath175 and",
    "also take @xmath176 , and the response becomes only 3-dimensinal transversal : @xmath177 for the meissner effect , we only consider the static field @xmath178 , then @xmath179 we calculate this response by our green s functions .",
    "we concentrate on the case of the scalar @xmath1 and the 0th component of the vector @xmath2 . for the finite @xmath180 ,",
    "it becomes rather complicated calculation .",
    "here we only want to study the meissner effect , then we take the london limit @xmath181 . after the frequency summation , we obtain @xmath182 where @xmath183 for the scalar @xmath1 case is @xmath184 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + |\\delta^{s}|^{4}[-3(p^{2}_{0}-3\\mu^{2})+5{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$}}^{2}+3m^{2}]+3|\\delta^{s}|^{6}\\big\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the vector @xmath2 case is @xmath185 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + |\\delta^{v}_{0}|^{4}[3(3p^{2}_{0}-\\mu^{2})+5{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ p$}}^{2}-9m^{2}]-3|\\delta^{v}_{0}|^{6}\\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( b17 ) , the first and second terms become zero at @xmath71 , and only contribute the neighbor of the fermi surface to the integral .",
    "the integral of these two terms always converge .",
    "these terms have their origin on the terms which describe collisionless elementary excitations  [ 29 ] .",
    "the third and fourth terms give diverged integrals , and we interpret these terms as coming from the terms which describe the creation - annihilation of the cooper pair  [ 29 ] .",
    "the third and fourth terms have small temperature dependences . in the finite - temperature field theory , @xmath186 is devided into @xmath187 with the definition @xmath188 , and the usual renormalization procedure is adopted to the @xmath189  [ 28,30 ] . here",
    "we also use this method to handle the divergence of ( b17 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath190 and @xmath191 it is well - known that , after the method of usual gauge - invariant regularization and renormalization is performed to @xmath192 , this term becomes @xmath193 , and vanishes at @xmath194 .",
    "therefore , for our aim , @xmath195 should be calculated . by using this function ,",
    "we examine ( b16 ) at @xmath181 .",
    "this examination corresponds to treat the london equation at @xmath181 .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the integral ( b17 ) corresponds to the temperature dependence of the supercurrent in the relativistic superconductivity .",
