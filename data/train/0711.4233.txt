    "let us recall the following : for a collection of classical particles , @xmath97 is written as  @xcite @xmath98 for @xmath99 , i.e. , as an average over the relative positions @xmath100 of particles surrounding a given particle . as a result ,",
    "@xmath95 for @xmath96 if @xmath101 , e.g. , for particles formulated on a lattice",
    ". such behavior of @xmath97 thus implies the absence of particle correlations at short distances .",
    "in this section we study the case of graphene . in the present treatment the @xmath23 and @xmath24 sectors are independent and the spectral weight @xmath102 with @xmath103 is given by the sum @xmath104 for @xmath99 . for the @xmath23 sector one may simply replace , in eq .",
    "( [ rhorhonr ] ) , @xmath105 by @xmath106 of eq .",
    "( [ gpsikn ] ) and note that the level indices @xmath107 now run over all integers , @xmath108 .",

    "( [ gpsigchi ] ) relates @xmath121 and @xmath126 so that @xmath127 the equalities @xmath128 and @xmath129 then imply the following : ( i )  the @xmath23 and @xmath24 sectors contribute equally to the vacuum spectral weight , @xmath130 .",
    "( ii )  the spectral weight @xmath5 is the same for the charge - conjugate states with @xmath131 . in view of this",
    "we shall focus on the case @xmath132 from now on .    in the limit @xmath22 of practical interest ,",
    "distinctions between @xmath133 and @xmath134 disappear : @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath138 , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ gpsikn ] ) .",
    "this yields @xmath139 in particular , @xmath140 shows that the graphene vacuum and the @xmath141 states , all of zero energy , have the same spectral weight @xmath142 .",
    "actually we earlier noted such degeneracy in electric susceptibility for the @xmath143 and @xmath141 states ,  @xcite and these states now turn out to be indistinguishable in both the real and imaginary parts of density response ; we discuss this point in more detail later .    to proceed further let us note some basic properties of the transition rates @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ gammapsichi ] ) that the transition rates among the positive - energy states and those among the negative - energy states are essentially the same whereas they are different from the rates across the dirac sea ( @xmath146 with @xmath147 ) .",
    "this feature is seen from fig .  1  ( a ) , which illustrates typical profiles of @xmath148 for @xmath149 .",
    "in general , @xmath150 is significantly peaked at some value of @xmath151 and the peak position rises only gradually as the level gap @xmath152 increases .",
    "the structure factor @xmath97 for small @xmath153 is thus governed by virtual transitions to neighboring levels while its property at larger @xmath153 is determined by transitions across larger gaps .",
    "it is readily expected from this property that the sum over an infinite number of negative - energy levels would make the weight @xmath5 cutoff ( @xmath154 ) dependent for small @xmath155 , actually to @xmath156 . in particular , the vacuum weight @xmath157 vanishes at @xmath158 and grows rapidly with @xmath159 for fixed @xmath154 , whereas it diverges as @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "see fig .  1  ( b ) .",
    "indeed , evaluating the @xmath162 terms in @xmath163 shows that the divergence is logarithmic in @xmath154 , @xmath164 with @xmath165 and for @xmath22 .",
    "this ultraviolet divergence is physical .",
    "the infinite depth of the dirac sea , of course , is an artifact of the continuum model  ( [ hzero ] ) and the cutoff scale @xmath166 is set by the energy scale above which the model loses its validity .",
    "let us recall here that for conventional qh systems the charge operator trivially annihilates the vacuum , @xmath167 , and the vacuum spectral weight vanishes .",
    "accordingly , the nonzero vacuum weight @xmath168 itself is a `` relativistic '' signature of graphene , @xmath169 which is a consequence of particle - hole pair creation or the presence of the dirac sea .",
    "it is perfectly legitimate to consider the vacuum weight with such a physical cutoff @xmath154 ( apart from its precise value ) .",
    "one can equally well extract cutoff - insensitive information out of it .",
    "one possible way is to consider a variation of @xmath168 for @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "experimentally this means measuring the vacuum weight for @xmath170 and @xmath171 separately .",
    "for @xmath171 the spectral weight for the graphene vacuum @xmath172 with @xmath22 is written as @xmath173 which represents a collection of virtual transitions  @xcite from a negative - energy electron state with momentum @xmath174 to a positive - energy state with @xmath175 via the charge density @xmath176 ; here @xmath177 denotes the angle between @xmath174 and @xmath175 ; @xmath120 and @xmath178 denote the spin and valley degeneracy .",
    "this is again ultraviolet divergent .",
    "for regularization we cut off the @xmath174 integral at @xmath179 and choose the `` fermi momentum '' @xmath180 so that the dirac sea accommodates the same number of electrons as in the @xmath181 case , @xmath182 , i.e. , @xmath183 .",
    "a direct calculation yields @xmath184 the cutoff @xmath185 dependence thus correctly disappears from the difference @xmath186 , with the result @xmath187 as seen from fig .  1  ( b ) ,",
    "the vacuum weight @xmath188 differs only slightly for @xmath181 and @xmath171 .    actually for all @xmath0",
    "the spectral weight @xmath5 contains the vacuum fluctuations and the static structure factor @xmath97 is necessarily cutoff - dependent .",
    "a possible cutoff - independent measure in experiment is to compare the spectral weights for @xmath189 and @xmath143 ( with @xmath181 ) .",
    "correspondingly let us define by @xmath190 the structure factor with the vacuum contribution subtracted .",
    "for the @xmath191 states ( with @xmath192 ) , @xmath193 in terms of the cutoff - independent deviations @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "for @xmath196 they are rewritten as @xmath197 analogously for @xmath198 . in reaching the second line ,",
    "we have used the formulas ( valid for @xmath22 and @xmath160 ) : @xmath199\\ ,   e^{z } -{1\\over{4}}\\ , { z^{|n| } \\over{|n|!}},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\label{sumgkn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 and @xmath200 ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath201 and @xmath202 as @xmath203 ; the decrease is slower for larger @xmath204 , as depicted in fig .  2  ( a ) .",

    "there are some notable features : ( 1 )  @xmath211 for @xmath212 .",
    "this is a consequence of the uniformity of charge at long wavelengths .",
    "( 2 )  @xmath211 for @xmath213 .",
    "this shows that the large @xmath153 portion of @xmath214 is common to all @xmath0 and is governed by the vacuum weight @xmath168 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath97 itself would rise with @xmath153 , in sharp contrast to the standard behavior @xmath215 as @xmath216 for `` nonrelativistic '' hall electrons in eq .",
    "( [ spnr ] ) .",
    "( 3 )  @xmath208 tends to saturate around 0.25 over a certain broad range of @xmath153 for higher filling factors @xmath0 .",
    "the subtracted structure factor @xmath208 , unlike @xmath97 , refers to quantum fluctuations of a finite number of filled levels above the vacuum and is governed by virtual transitions , newly allowed or suppressed by the presence of such levels , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ dij ] ) .",
    "saturation is a consequence of a competition between the transitions among positive - energy states and the suppressed vacuum polarization effect .    in this connection ,",
    "let us try to retain only the positive - energy states and transitions among them . in fig .",
    "3  ( a ) we plot a projected structure factor @xmath217 calculated from the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dij ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath218 i.e. , even the positive - energy sector alone does not recover the @xmath215 behavior of conventional qh systems .",
    "while @xmath217 itself is not directly observable in experiment , this feature  ( [ splusp ] ) would indicate indirectly that @xmath208 is significantly smaller than 1/2 .",
    "some remarks on the influence of a mass gap are in order here .",
    "the relativistic treatment makes sense when the mass gap is tiny @xmath219 . in the `` nonrelativistic '' limit @xmath220 where the mass gap is large compared with the depth of the dirac sea , in contrast , the landau - level sum is limited to a finite interval @xmath221 and ceases to yield a divergence .",
    "the virtual transition rates across the mass gap scale like @xmath222 ( while @xmath223 for @xmath224 ) , and the vacuum spectral weight @xmath225 tends to zero like @xmath226 as @xmath227 .",
    "figure  3  ( b ) shows the manner how @xmath228 develops as the mass gap gets large for @xmath229 .",
    "the @xmath230 state is now distinguishable in @xmath97 from the vacuum . in the @xmath227 limit",
    ", @xmath231 recovers the standard behavior @xmath215 as @xmath216 for all integer @xmath0 .    to explore the origin of the unconventional behavior  ( [ splusp ] )",
    "let us note the formula @xmath232 which follows from eq .",
    "( [ sumgkn ] ) .",
    "actually this formula is valid for @xmath21 as well , since it is independently derived from the evaluation of the static weight @xmath233 for a hypothetical state @xmath75 with only one filled landau level @xmath234 and all other levels empty .",
    "it is thus a consequence of completeness of physical states .    in the `` nonrelativistic '' limit",
    "the dirac sea effectively disappears . then eq .",
    "( [ completedirac ] ) is reduced to eq .",
    "( [ completenr ] ) , which in turn leads to the behavior @xmath215 for @xmath216 .",
    "for @xmath22 the large-@xmath153 behavior of eq .",
    "( [ completedirac ] ) is governed by the sums over @xmath235 so that @xmath236 as seen also from eq .  ( [ sumgkn ] ) .",
    "this precisely accounts for the behavior of @xmath217 in eq .",
    "( [ splusp ] ) .",
    "it is now clear that both the masslessness ( or a tiny mass gap ) of the quasiparticles and the presence of the dirac sea are crucial for the unusual density correlations @xmath237 at short distances . in other words ,",
    "correlations fail to vanish at short distances because of particle - hole pair creation ; the inability of localizing massless particles is a purely `` relativistic '' effect , underlying also the klein paradox .",
    "@xcite    equation  ( [ completedirac ] ) may suggest that the vacuum spectral weight @xmath168 would have a contribution of @xmath238 from the dirac sea , it actually rises like @xmath239 , as we have seen in eq .",
    "( [ vacuumweight ] ) .",
    "had we defined the `` vacuum '' static structure factor @xmath97 with normalization by the total number of electrons in the dirac sea , it would vanish like @xmath240 .",
    "this shows again that , for massless particles and in the presence of the dirac sea , the standard ( classical ) picture of particle correlations does not necessarily make sense .",
    "finally we wish to comment on some peculiarities of the zero - energy @xmath50 levels , especially on how the coulomb interaction @xmath28 affects their response . in the random - phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "the effect of @xmath31 of eq .",
