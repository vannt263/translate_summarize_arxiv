    "a discrepancy exists between the extent of observed visible matter in the universe and that inferred from the motion of galaxies and clusters of galaxies if newton s second law and law of gravitation are applied .",
    "the existence of abundant unobserved ( or  dark \" ) matter has been proposed by many cosmologists to account for the discrepancy .",
    "an alternative but no less radical explanation is that either : newton s second law should be modified for the low accelerations evident in observations of galactic motion ; or that the equations of gravity should be modified for these low accelerations [ 1,2 ] .",
    "mond was first put forward in 1983 [ 1 ] and during the last twenty three years has continued to be consistent with the growing body of observational data on the rotation curves of galaxies [ 3 ] , and has survived a number of studies looking for consistency with various other effects otherwise requiring dark matter , such as cosmological models derived from combining a multitude of observational data [ 4 ] , to tidal streams from a companion galaxy to the milky way [ 5 ] .",
    "however , mond theory is empirical in nature , being derived exclusively from correlations based upon observations and , to date , has eluded derivation from first principles , although the recent relativistic more fundamental formulation from bekenstein [ 5 ] offers both mond and newtonian limits .    in this paper",
    "we show that the introduction of a @xmath0 large - scale dimension to the description of space - time can account for all aspects of the empirical equations of mond , provide a natural transition function @xmath3 between the mond and newtonian regimes , and explain the link between the mond parameter @xmath2 and key universal parameters , such as hubble s constant .",
    "an essential feature of this approach is that it does * not * require the principles of newton s second law to be modified , only that they should be applied in five dimensions of space - time rather than four .",
    "the paper is divided into four sections as follows : formulation of newton s laws in a 5-dimensional space - time ; the origin and role of the acceleration , @xmath4 , originating from the presence of a @xmath0 dimension ; connection to the equations of mond ; and a derivation and calculation of the pioneer anomaly .",
    "the paper concludes with a short discussion section .",
    "the @xmath0 dimension represented by the parameter @xmath1 is assumed orthogonal to the three space dimensions @xmath5 and to the time dimension @xmath6 .",
    "it is also assumed that bodies can only propagate in @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and have no access to the @xmath1 dimension .",
    "however forces originating from the @xmath1 dimension can act on bodies in @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  1 , where only a single space dimension @xmath9 is shown together with the @xmath0 dimension @xmath1 forming an @xmath10 plane .    a body at point @xmath11 is subject to three forces ( accelerations ) : ( i ) gravitational acceleration @xmath12 towards a gravitational source mass @xmath13 in the direction of negative @xmath9 ; ( ii ) an applied inertial acceleration @xmath14 in the direction of @xmath9 positive ; and ( iii ) an assumed ( mond - like ) acceleration @xmath4 in the positive @xmath1 direction and orthogonal to @xmath9 . in a world of three space dimensions and no @xmath0 dimension , balance would simply be defined in terms of component balances in each of the three space dimensions @xmath5 . with a @xmath0 dimension",
    "it is useful to introduce the concept of branes and look for a condition in which the components in two mutually orthogonal branes ( denoted by symbols @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) can be balanced . in figure  1 the angle at which the branes intersect with the reference axes ( @xmath17 ) is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "force balance occurs when @xmath19    these two equations are simultaneously satisfied if @xmath20    ordinarily it would be assumed that the imaginary part could not be realised by measurement in ` real ' space .",
    "however , as will be shown later this imaginary part can give rise to measurable effects under certain circumstances .    before leaving this section",
    "we return to the consider the angle @xmath18 , which defines where the brane walls are found .",
    "this angle is given by @xmath21 this angle will not be constant throughout space but will be determined by the local value of this gradient .",
    "in a closed universe , which is isotropic on a large - scale , there is a finite radius of curvature to space - time even remote from gravitating bodies .",
    "we attribute this underlying parameter , @xmath22 , to our assumed @xmath0 dimension . propagating",
    "electro - magnetic radiation effectively follows a world - line of radius of curvature @xmath22 and this can be interpreted as a universal acceleration applying throughout space ( see section  4.1 ) with a value @xmath23 acting in the direction of positive @xmath1 .",
    ", through the equation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the curvature [ 7 ] ]    the validity of this relationship implies that a closed 4-dimensional space - time is considered to be embedded within a locally flat 5-dimensional universe .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  2 from which we now derive @xmath4 .    in figure",
    "2 the space dimension @xmath26 represents any one of the three space dimensions @xmath5 . a single space dimension segment",
    "@xmath27 represents a distance @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the speed of light in vacuo , and the radius of curvature of a ( geodesic ) path of electromagnetic radiation in space - time remote from gravitational fields is @xmath22 . the radius of curvature of single space dimension segment , @xmath28 , ( remote from gravitational fields ) is then given by @xmath30 . assuming newton s second law applies in 5 dimensions , the centrifugal acceleration acting on electromagnetic radiation travelling along space dimension segment @xmath28 is given by : @xmath31 the value of @xmath4 is now given by the component of the centrifugal acceleration acting in the @xmath1 direction - i.e. in the direction of expansion of the universe .",
    "hence : @xmath32      at any point @xmath11 in space dimension @xmath9 adjacent to a gravitating mass @xmath13 , but otherwise empty , there exist two accelerations ; ( i ) the acceleration due to the gravitational field of @xmath13 , and ( ii ) @xmath4 acting in direction of @xmath1 increasing .",
    "this is shown in figure  3 . at the point",
    "@xmath11 , a brane can be defined in which there exists balance between these two accelerations , @xmath12 , and @xmath4 .",
    "this brane @xmath15 satisfies the equation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the local gradient , @xmath35 , of the brane at point o relative to the space dimension x.    the brane ( defined as @xmath15 in the diagram ) is the locus of all points @xmath11 at which there is balance between @xmath12 and @xmath4 , i.e. between accelerations of contraction of the universe on the one hand and expansion of the universe on the other",
    ". it can be convenient to think of this balance condition as a form of  surface tension \" somewhat akin to the  rubber - sheet \" analogy of general relativity .",
    "this balance condition is a function of distance @xmath9 , away from the mass , and this allows a local functional form for @xmath36 in the presence of a gravitating body as : @xmath37\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an interesting characteristic of the brane @xmath15 can be noted at this point simply from the equation of balance between @xmath12 and @xmath4 : the closer is point @xmath11 to the gravitating mass @xmath13 , the greater is the gradient @xmath35 and the more closely aligned is the brane @xmath15 to the @xmath1-dimension , and as we move further away and out towards infinity the more the acceleration lying in the plane of the brane @xmath15 itself converges to @xmath12 .",
    "the original motivation for mond was to explain the quasi - flat rotation curves of galaxies . hence to establish if there is a connection between this work and mond we need to see how the force balance in 5 dimensions affects orbiting systems . for an object in a stable circular orbit ( i.e. constant velocity , @xmath38 ) in the @xmath39 plane ( see figure  4 )",
    "the centrifugal acceleration in standard 4-dimensional space - time is @xmath40 adapting this for 5 dimensions requires the introduction of a new angle , @xmath41 , between the angular momentum vector , @xmath42 , which now lies in the @xmath43 plane and the @xmath1 axis as shown in figure  5 .",
    "equation  10 then becomes latexmath:[\\[a_x={\\underline \\omega_{zr}}\\,\\wedge\\,{\\underline v } =    imaginary component is in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "+ the angle @xmath41 will again be locally determined and by contrast with the variation in the angle @xmath18 which arises from the dependence of potential energy on position , we associate @xmath41 with the kinetic energy . replacing potential energy with the non - relativistic kinetic energy in equation  9",
    "gives ] @xmath45\\ ] ]         lying in the plane @xmath46.,height=124 ]    @xmath47 is independent of @xmath41 and can be determined from the familiar case of @xmath48 being aligned strictly in the direction of @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath49 ) when @xmath50 . as for @xmath41",
    "we attribute this to the gradient , @xmath35 , induced by the inertial accelerations acting on a body , and this must be calculated from equation  12 using @xmath51 for the body in orbit in figure  4 this gives @xmath52 however , @xmath53 is just the expected newtonian _ inertial _ acceleration , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "hence @xmath56     space at an angle @xmath41 to the @xmath57 plane.,height=124 ]    an implication of the function @xmath58 is that a full description of the motion of bodies in three dimensional space @xmath5 necessarily requires consideration of a 5-dimensional frame of reference ( i.e. @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the implications of the equation @xmath59 are twofold : first , that all finite angular momentun vectors have a component in the @xmath1 dimension , and second that the plane of rotation of a body will lie solely in the three space dimensions @xmath5 only if the centrifugal acceleration of the body tends to zero .",
    "one consequence of these principles is that the rest vector ( defined as @xmath60 ) for all zero angular velocities must be aligned in the direction of the @xmath0 dimension in the sense of @xmath1 positive .",
    "this is the same as saying that the default zero angular velocity component lies in the @xmath0 dimension for all matter and energy . as the _ total _ angular velocity , , increases the vector becomes increasingly displaced towards the @xmath8-direction , i.e. being always normal to the plane of rotation ( @xmath61 space in figure  6 ) , subtends an angle @xmath41 away from the @xmath1-direction .",
    "returning to the ` centrifugal ' accelerations expressed in a 5-dimensional framework , we can now use the expression for @xmath62 in equation 11 which gives @xmath63\\ ] ] which , for small @xmath54 ( @xmath64 ) , becomes : @xmath65 the real part of this expression recovers the mond limit if @xmath4 is identified directly with the @xmath2 parameter from mond .    for large @xmath54 ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "it becomes : @xmath67 the real part of which recovers the newtonian limit .",
    "hence the real terms in these equations reproduce the key mond equations and do indeed argue for a clear association between this derivation and mond .",
    "moreover this analysis provides a form for the transition function @xmath3 of mond directly as equation  16 , derived here from first principles , is precisely one of the fitting functions noted by milgrom [ http://www.astro.umd.edu/  ssm / mond / faq.html ] to give good agreement with observational data . ] .",
    "it can be seen from the above derivation that this transition function is governed ultimately by equation  12 , which is the lorentz contraction formula approximation for @xmath68 .",
    "in addition the value of @xmath4 is now fixed by equation  5 and in the next subsection we show that its value is remarkably close to the value of @xmath2 used by mond .",
    "substitution of equation  18 into equation 3 , to satisfy the condition of a force balance in 5-dimensions , shows that @xmath69 as expected in the newtonian limit .",
    "however if we do the same with equation 17 there is a residual imaginary term which in the limit @xmath70 becomes @xmath71 .",
    "this appears to be consistent with a seemless transition at the fringes of galaxies from fixed orbits to those increasingly governed by the expansion of the universe .      to calculate a value for @xmath4 from equation  5",
    "we adopt a straight - forward cosmology with an expanding universe in which time increments , @xmath72 , and space increments , @xmath28 can be related to @xmath22 as shown in figure  7 , which gives @xmath73    ) and time ( @xmath72 ) are defined by reference to @xmath22.,height=288 ]    consider two galaxies embedded in expanding space - time with zero peculiar motion ; i.e. @xmath74 is constant .",
    "their apparent mutual recession velocity , @xmath75 , will be given by @xmath76 at constant @xmath74 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath77 by hubble s law this should also be equal to @xmath78 which provides the link between @xmath79 and @xmath22 @xmath80 if the value for @xmath79 is taken to be @xmath81 and the age of the universe , @xmath82 , is taken to be @xmath83years , then equation  22 gives a minimum value for @xmath84 m which substituted into equation  5 gives a value of @xmath85ms@xmath86 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the mond parameter @xmath2 derived from observations of rotation curves of galaxies [ 1,2 ] , so the connection with mond is now clear and in the remaining sections we substitute @xmath2 for @xmath4 , although there may be good reasons why a more accurate version is @xmath87 . ] .",
    "if the mond parameter value of @xmath88ms@xmath86 is adopted then the implied value for @xmath22 is @xmath89 m .",
    "the original motivation for mond , and hence this work , was in explaining two aspects of galaxy dynamics ; i.e. the flat rotation curves and the tulley - fisher relationship . equation  16 allows us to predict what we expect from the derivation in this paper . matching the reals parts of equations 16 and 3 gives @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the mass enclosed within a radius @xmath9 .",
    "the rotation curve , @xmath92 , is then given by @xmath93 as an example of the transition region for a system with a centralised mass distribution , the left - hand panel in figure  8 shows this function for the solar - system .",
    "the departure from newtonian gravity is visually obvious on this plot beyond 300au .",
    "the asymptotic orbital velocity is @xmath94 m/s . in the right - hand panel",
    "we show the difference between the newtonian prediction and that from equation  24 .        as an example of a galactic rotation curve ,",
    "figure  9 is plotted for a distributed mass inferred from measured data from a typical spiral galaxy . in figures",
    "8&9 the lower curve show the newtonian behaviour .",
    "it is worth noting that in the current derivation there are no free parameters from one galaxy to the next , other than needing to know the mass distribution .",
    "uncertainty in the value of @xmath2 is a systematic which applies to all galaxies .",
    "the asymptotic velocity from equation  24 is @xmath95 which underlies the tulley - fisher relationship .",
    "equation  16 has been derived for a system with angular momentum and predicts an observable departure from a newtonian system .",
    "what if we now consider a system without angular momentum ? combining equations  9 and 12",
    "we can write @xmath96 where @xmath97 is potential energy and @xmath98 is kinetic energy of a body with mass @xmath99 . for a body undergoing purely gravitational acceleration towards a much larger mass @xmath13 without any modified response from the newtonian expectation this becomes @xmath100 which is none other than equation 1 .",
    "this implies that there are no components of linear momentum vectors lying in the @xmath1 dimension .",
    "moreover if we also impose an energy balance with respect to time , @xmath101 into which we substitute equations 9 and 12 we get the result @xmath102    hence there is a balance condition without reference to the additional dimension @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) and so without departure from newtonian principles applied in 4-dimensional space - time .",
    "this implies that mond - type behaviour is _ not _ to be expected from a system without angular momentum .",
    "finally , we consider whether the 5-dimensional orbital dynamics described in this paper can be used to explain the pioneer anomaly [ 10 ] .",
    "the acceleration parameter , @xmath4 , introduced in section 3.1 , itself has two components : an angular velocity @xmath103 ( with magnitude @xmath104 ) ; and @xmath29 for propagating radiation .",
    "the angular velocity , @xmath103 , is orthogonal to @xmath4 and , being a function of @xmath1 , will vary as @xmath1 varies . in particular , @xmath103 will vary with time for a body moving away from a gravitating mass , @xmath13 , in accordance with equation 9 .",
    "however , to find the complete time derivative of @xmath103 account must also be taken of the time dependency of the radius of curvature of space in an expanding universe as described in sections 3.1 and 4.1 .",
    "hence we start with the angular velocity @xmath105 that is associated with the acceleration parameter , @xmath106 , for a space dimension interval @xmath28 ( see figures 2 and 10 ) .",
    "@xmath107    substituting for @xmath1 from equation 9 ( in terms of distance @xmath26 rather than @xmath9 ) and for @xmath108 from equation 19 , the time derivation of @xmath105 can be expressed as    @xmath109\\left[\\frac{g_s}{c^2}\\right]\\frac{ds}{dt}+\\cot{\\alpha}\\frac{d\\alpha}{dt}\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath110 is the gravitational acceleration due to a mass @xmath13 , @xmath111 is the radial velocity of a body with respect to @xmath13 , ( defined as @xmath112 ) ; @xmath113 is @xmath104 in the general case of @xmath114 rather than @xmath22 in equation 19 ; @xmath115 ; and , from equation 22 , @xmath116 , again in the general case of @xmath114 rather than @xmath22 .",
    "the angular acceleration @xmath117 is the component of @xmath118 resolved in the direction orthogonal to @xmath4 .",
    "hence equation 31 can be approximated by    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the angular acceleration derived in the first part ( @xmath121 ) from motion in the direction of @xmath26 radially away from the @xmath13 and , in the second part ( @xmath122 ) , from the consequences of unbound motion ( i.e. not within a fixed orbit ) that is subject to the influence of the background expansion of the universe .",
    "the angular acceleration @xmath117 is orthogonal to @xmath110 and gives rise to a tangential acceleration ( i.e an observed linear acceleration ) acting in the direction of @xmath26 orthogonal to both @xmath103 and @xmath1 from the relationship    @xmath123    this tangential acceleration appears to be coreolis - like in nature within the context of 5-dimensional orbital dynamics - i.e. it derives from angular accelerations that arise if there is radial motion ( @xmath124 ) orthogonal to an angular velocity ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "it is this coreolis - like acceleration which is identified with the pioneer anomaly and is given the symbol @xmath125 . from equations 32 and 33 , @xmath125 can be written :    @xmath126    equation 34 can be used to predict values for the pioneer anomaly acceleration ( @xmath125 ) . in particular , for pioneer 11 between distances of 22au and 32au from the sun ; and , for pioneer 10 , between 40au and 70au [ 11 ] .",
    "the respective average radial velocities of the spacecraft at these distances were @xmath127kms@xmath128 and @xmath129kms@xmath128 .",
    "the figure for the mass of the sun is taken to be @xmath130 kg and @xmath131kms@xmath128mpc@xmath128 .",
    "the predicted values for @xmath125 are shown in table  1 .",
    ".predicted values for the pioneer anomaly acceleration.[tab : exp ] [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     a number of things can be noted about these results and equation 34 :    * all the figures for @xmath125 lie within the tolerance limits reported for the pioneer anomaly : @xmath132ms@xmath86 , except for those predicted for pioneer 11 at distances less than 27au .",
    "* at the distances considered , the second term ( @xmath122 ) makes the larger contribution to @xmath125 ( in fact , @xmath133 ms@xmath86 ) and , in this form of the equation , the term does not vary with distance from the sun , nor with radial velocity ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "however , this term only arises after the pioneer spacecraft have entered hyperbolic orbits ( following their final fly - bys ) and their motion is subject to the coreolis - like effect described above . *",
    "if the equation is integrated as a single continuous function over the distance range 20au to 70au at an average radial velocity of @xmath134kms@xmath128 and assuming a hyperbolic orbit throughout , the value for @xmath125 generated is @xmath135ms@xmath86 .",
    "* at distances of @xmath136au and with the spacecraft travelling at a radial velocity @xmath137kms@xmath128 , but without having entered hyperbolic orbit , the value of @xmath125 predicted by the equation remains @xmath138ms@xmath86 as the loss of the second term which falls away for a bounded orbit , is made up for by the stronger gravitational acceleration of the sun in the first term .",
    "* as radial velocities decline to zero in bound orbits , so will @xmath125 . *",
    "the equation only takes into account a single space dimension ( @xmath26 ) - the radial distance from @xmath13 .",
    "this prevents it from describing the full 3-dimensional motion of the pioneer spacecraft as they travel through and out of the solar system .",
    "in addition , the extent to which the transition from bound to unbound orbits progressively introduces the second term is not addressed .",
    "a full 5-dimensional derivation of the equation should correct this short - coming , but is beyond the scope of this paper . * in circumstances where the hyperbolic orbit term does apply , the scale link between @xmath125 and the mond parameter @xmath139 , is apparent from the relationship @xmath140 ( derived from equations 5 and 22 ) where @xmath141 for the current age of the universe .",
    "the level of agreement between the values for @xmath125 predicted by equation 34 and those reported seems to be reasonably good , albeit that the reported value is interpreted to be constant whereas equation 34 predicts a range of possible values that depend on several key parameters , such as the radial velocity of the pioneer spacecrafts .",

    "* a possible derivation of the pioneer anomaly using 5-dimensional orbital dynamics including a calculation involving key cosmological constants with no free parameters .    the principal objection to introducing a fifth large - scale dimension into models of the universe is generally taken to be a lack of direct observational evidence to support its existence",
