    "some interesting models @xcite explaining fermion masses and mixing within the context of a gut theory , a family symmetry and using type i see - saw @xcite , can not easily account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe through thermal leptogenesis .",
    "working in the context of a gauge group pati - salam ( ps ) @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a family group , we address two natural questions : how complicated is it to find a model realizing both mechanisms in a non - fine tuned way ? and",
    "can we determine predictive features of such a model ?    instead of concentrating on a particular model we first re - analyze , in the light of recent experimental measurements and analysis , the validity of the yukawa textures that are commonly embedded in @xmath1 family models @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we find that while these yukawa textures themselves are still compatible with experimental observations , the @xmath1 models that could potentially explain them should be modified . in particular , the messengers of such theories should be carefully analyzed since the details of them could determine the real predictability and viability of such models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in @xmath5 2 we state the parameters of the yukawa textures that are usually embedded in @xmath1 family models @xcite-@xcite , briefly explaining which observables are used for the fit to experimental quantities .",
    "we leave for the appendix a some details of the fits .",
    "one has been performed for @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 small , ( table [ tbl : f_12_13_diffsgn_small_tbeta ] ) and the other one for @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath7 large , ( table [ tbl : f_12_13_diffsgn_large_tbeta ] ) .",
    "the fit for large @xmath7 is the preferred one .",
    "then in @xmath5 3 we re - state the assumptions for these textures to be embedded in @xmath1 family groups , paying attention to the messenger sector of the theory and giving as an example a minimal messenger content for the model in @xcite .",
    "these messengers are not @xmath9 singlets thus in principle this ansatz could be embedded in @xmath10 models where the breaking to the ps group happens close to the unification scale , such that gauge coupling unification is not significantly altered . in @xmath5 4",
    "we explain how the observed neutrino mixing can arise in this particular example . under these guidelines",
    "we exemplify how different assumptions of the messenger masses can be taken into account to have different yukawa couplings and different predictions for @xmath7 .",
    "the constraints coming from flavour violation and the parameters relevant for leptogenesis are discussed in @xmath5 5 and @xmath5 6 respectively .",
    "lepton flavour violation gives important constraints on the elements of @xmath11 , the yukawa coupling of the right - handed neutrinos in the basis where charged leptons are diagonal . as a result",
    "we find that for our example of messenger sector of an @xmath1 model , detailed in @xmath5 3 , the messengers for the right - handed neutrinos and those for the rest of the fermions should have a rather different behaviour .",
    "it is interesting to note that flavoured thermal leptogenesis @xcite can account for the explanation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the solution for low @xmath7 is not pretty sensitive to the element @xmath12 , while the solution for high @xmath7 it is .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that in the context of right - handed neutrino sequential dominance ( rhnsd ) @xcite , a ratio @xmath13 for a mass of the lightest right - handed neutrino of @xmath14 gev and a relative high @xmath7 could account for the right value of the baryon asymmetry through flavoured leptogenesis .",
    "our solution for explaining the mixing in the lepton sector differs from the rhnsd solution and hence the weak dependence of @xmath12 for low @xmath7 .",
    "finally we conclude in @xmath5 7 by summarizing that it is possible to construct a @xmath1 model with type i see - saw , account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , with the decay of the lightest right - handed neutrino and satisfy flavour violation bounds .",
