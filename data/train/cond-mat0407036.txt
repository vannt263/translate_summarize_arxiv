    "<S> limits of weak and strong spin  orbit coupling are distinguished , and spin properties of the electronic states elucidated . the case of strong rashba spin splitting </S>",

    "<S> wire subbands leads to an unusual spin structure where the direction of motion for electrons can fix their spin state . </S>",
    "<S> this peculiar property has important ramifications for linear transport in the quantum wire , giving rise to spin accumulation without magnetic fields or ferromagnetic contacts . </S>",
    "<S> a description for interacting rashba  split quantum wires is developed , which is based on a generalization of the tomonaga  luttinger model .    </S>",
