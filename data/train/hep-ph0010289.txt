    "the inclusive production of a single charged hadron , @xmath3 , in the annihilation process @xmath4 has been measured at many different @xmath0 colliders over a wide range of center - of - mass ( cm ) energies , @xmath5 , between 3 and 183  gev @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath3 may either refer to a specific hadron species , _",
    "e.g. _ , pion , kaon , or proton , or to the sum over all charged - hadron species .",
    "a large amount of precise data has now become available from various experimental collaborations at cern lep1 and slac slc , who started taking data several years ago . the process  ( [ process ] ) is particularly suitable in order to study the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into hadrons .",
    "the information contained in fixed - target , hadron - collider , and @xmath6-scattering data is less useful , since it is obscured by theoretical uncertainties from the parton distribution functions and the choice of factorization scales connected with the initial states .",
    "the partonic cross sections pertinent to process  ( [ process ] ) can be entirely calculated in perturbative qcd with no additional input , except for the strong - coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "they are known at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite and even at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) @xcite .",
    "the subsequent transition of the partons into hadrons takes place at an energy scale of the order of 1  gev and can , therefore , not be treated in perturbation theory . instead",
    ", the hadronization of the partons is described by fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , @xmath8 .",
    "their values correspond to the probability that the parton @xmath9 , which is produced at short distance , of order @xmath10 , fragments into the hadron @xmath3 carrying the fraction @xmath11 of the momentum of @xmath9 . in the case of process  ( [ process ] )",
    ", @xmath12 is typically of order @xmath13 .",
    "given their @xmath11 dependence at some scale @xmath14 , the evolution of the ffs with @xmath12 may be computed perturbatively . at present ,",
    "the evolution equations are only known through nlo .",
    "consistency requires that we do not include the nnlo corrections to the partonic cross sections @xcite in our analysis of process  ( [ process ] ) via unpolarized photons and @xmath1 bosons .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the fragmentation process in @xmath0 annihilation is of interest for several reasons .",
    "first , it allows us to test qcd quantitatively within one experiment observing hadrons at different values of @xmath5 and to determine the strong - coupling constant , @xmath15 , to be compared with determinations from other observables and/or processes .",
    "second , since according to the factorization theorem the ffs are independent of the process in which they have been determined , they can be used for quantitative predictions of inclusive single hadron cross sections in other processes , like @xmath16 , @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 scattering .",
    "third , the exact knowledge of the ffs , in particular for identified hadrons , may help to elucidate the fundamental features of hadronization and to constrain models used for the calculation of complete final states in various high - energy reactions .",
    "after the pioneering leading - order ( lo ) analyses of pion , kaon @xcite , and charmed - meson @xcite ffs in the late 70s , there had long been no progress on the theoretical side of this field . in the mid 90 s , nlo ff sets for @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 mesons @xcite have been constructed through fits to data of @xmath0 annihilation , mostly generated with monte carlo event generators .    in 1994/95 , two of us , together with binnewies , determined the ffs of quarks and gluons into @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons at lo and nlo from genuine experimental data , adopting two different strategies @xcite . in the first analysis @xcite , we included in the fit only the data on @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "production taken by the tpc / two - gamma collaboration @xcite at slac pep , with energy @xmath25  gev .",
    "these data combine small statistical errors with fine binning in @xmath11 and are thus more constraining than data collected by other experiments in the energy range from 5.2  gev to 44  gev .",
    "charged - pion and -kaon data at other energies were only used for cross checks . furthermore , theoretical predictions obtained using these ffs were compared with data on the inclusive production of unidentified charged hadrons taken at the pep , desy petra , and kek tristan colliders making an assumption on the @xmath26 contribution based on information extracted from the tpc data @xcite . in 1994 ,",
    "when the first analysis @xcite was performed , data with identified quark flavours did not exist .",
    "therefore , we had to make the assumption that the @xmath13 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) quarks fragment into @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) mesons in the same way .    in our second analysis @xcite , we could remove this assumption because new data on charged - hadron production with partial flavour separation had been released by the aleph collaboration @xcite at lep1 ( see also refs .",
    "apart from the usual data sample without flavour separation , they also presented light- and @xmath28-quark - enriched samples . here and in the following , we consider @xmath30 , @xmath29 , and @xmath13 quarks as light .",
    "in addition , we included in our fits accurate @xmath20 and @xmath21 data from aleph @xcite and information on tagged three - jet events from opal @xcite at lep1 , which constrained the gluon ffs . in order to describe the production of charged hadrons in terms of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 ffs",
    ", we needed some information on the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into protons and antiprotons . to that end",
    ", we introduced a function @xmath31 which parameterizes the ratio of the @xmath32 and @xmath20 production cross sections as measured by aleph @xcite .",
    "it is clear that this analysis @xcite suffered from the lack of specific data on the fragmentation of tagged quarks and gluons to @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 hadrons , rather than just to charged hadrons of unidentified species .",
    "this lack has been remedied in 1998 by the advent of new data from delphi @xcite at lep1 and sld @xcite at slc .",
    "besides other things , sld @xcite measured the differential production cross section , as a function of the scaled momentum @xmath33 , for the identified hadron species @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 in @xmath1-boson decays to light , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 quarks and in such decays without flavour separation . similarly , delphi @xcite presented @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 production data , covering the full momentum range up to 45.6  gev , discriminating between @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 events",
    ". there is also new specific information that allows us to better control the gluon ff .",
    "in fact , new gluon - tagged three - jet data of inclusive charged - hadron production was released by aleph @xcite and opal @xcite . in the opal @xcite analysis",
    ", the gluon jets were identified using the method proposed by gary @xcite .",
    "this method is based on rare events of the type @xmath37 in which the @xmath38- and @xmath39-quark jets appear in the same hemisphere of a multihadronic @xmath0 annihilation event .",
    "the object @xmath40 , which is taken to be the gluon jet , is defined by all hadrons observed in the hemisphere opposite to that containing the @xmath38- and @xmath39-quark jets .",
    "this method allows for the extraction of the gluon ff with as little theoretical bias as possible .",
    "it is supposed to be superior to the earlier opal @xcite measurement of the gluon ff based on a jet - finding algorithm to define the gluon jets , which entered the bkk analysis @xcite .",
    "the new opal @xcite data set comprises more points than the previous one @xcite , and the energy of the gluon jets is now well defined , with a mean value of @xmath41  gev .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to make full use of all the recent data from aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite , opal @xcite , and sld @xcite in order to construct new sets of lo and nlo ffs without imposing relations between the ffs of different flavours , except that we identify the ffs of @xmath30 and @xmath29 quarks into @xmath20 mesons and those of @xmath30 and @xmath13 quarks into @xmath21 mesons , as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case of protons and antiprotons",
    ", we fix the @xmath29-quark ffs to be half of the @xmath30-quark ffs . for completeness , we also include in our fits the older @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath32 production data without flavour separation from aleph @xcite , which also entered the bkk analysis @xcite . in order to be sensitive to the running of @xmath7 , _",
    "i.e. _ , to be able to fit the asymptotic scale parameter , @xmath42 , we also include the tpc data @xcite , as in refs .",
    "there is also precise data on charged - hadron production with flavour separation from aleph @xcite , who provided light- , @xmath27- , and @xmath28-quark - enriched samples , and from opal @xcite , who provided light- and @xmath28-quark - enriched samples . to be on the conservative side",
    ", we exclude this data from our fits because the contribution due to charged hadrons other than @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath32 is unknown and may be comparable or larger than the experimental errors .",
    "in fact , it turns out that this data yields rather sizeable @xmath43 values relative to the theoretical predictions obtained from our ffs",
    ". we also test our ffs against data from @xmath0 colliders with lower cm energies , namely , from desy doris @xcite and petra @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we study the longitudinal cross section for the production of charged hadrons on the @xmath1-boson resonance and compare the results with data from aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite , and opal @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section  2 , we summarize the data",
    "included in our fits , outline the theoretical framework , describe our fitting procedure , present our ffs , and discuss their goodness .",
    "furthermore , we check our ffs against @xmath0 data which are not included in our fits . in section  3 , we investigate for charged - hadron production how well our ffs satisfy the momentum sum rule , which we did not impose on our fits .",
    "furthermore , we examine to what extent our ffs also account for the longitudinal cross section of charged - hadron production on the @xmath1-boson resonance , and how our nlo gluon ff compares with the one of the bkk set  @xcite and with the one recently measured by delphi @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  4 .",
    ".cm energies , types of data , and @xmath44 values obtained at lo and nlo for various data samples . samples not used in the fits are marked by asterisks . [",
    "cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the comparisons presented in fig .",
    "10 provide us with a very useful check of the gluon ff in the low-@xmath11 range , where the data have small errors .",
    "in particular , the good agreement in the case of flavour separation nicely confirms the relative importance of the light- and @xmath28-quark ffs relative to the gluon ff .",
    "since the @xmath44 values obtained at nlo for the longitudinal cross section are comparable to those achieved in our nlo fit , we do not expect that the inclusion of the information on the longitudinal cross section in our nlo fit would significantly change the outcome .",
    "as is well known , the gluon ff only enters the prediction for @xmath45 at @xmath46 , while at @xmath47 it only contributes indirectly via the @xmath12 evolution .",
    "therefore , we have used the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite data on gluon - tagged three - jet events in order to constrain it .",
    "these data were already compared with the fitted gluon ff in fig .",
    "it is of interest to compare this gluon ff with the bkk @xcite one and the one recently extracted by delphi @xcite from their three - jet events for scales in the range @xmath48  gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a parameterization , valid for this @xmath49 range and for @xmath50 , was generated adopting an ansatz similar to the one introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "11 , the @xmath11 dependences of these three gluon ffs are studied for @xmath51 , 52.4 , 80.2 , and 200  gev .",
    "the results for @xmath52 and 80.2  gev are compared with the aleph @xcite and opal @xcite gluon - tagged three - jet data , which are included in our fits . from fig .",
    "11 the following observations can be made .",
    "our new gluon ff is rather similar to the bkk one , especially for larger values of @xmath49 . at @xmath53  gev ,",
    "the delphi gluon ff is somewhat steeper than the new and bkk ones , except for large @xmath11 values , and it agrees slightly better with the opal @xcite data . on the other hand , our new gluon ff agrees best with the aleph @xcite data at @xmath52  gev . at @xmath51  gev",
    ", the delphi gluon ff has a flatter @xmath11 dependence than the other ones and overshoots them , while at @xmath54  gev the situation is similar to the case of @xmath53  gev .",
    "the lep1 and slc experiments have provided us with a wealth of high - precision experimental information on how partons fragment into low - mass charged hadrons @xcite .",
    "the data partly come as light- , @xmath27- , and @xmath28-quark - enriched samples without @xcite or with identified final - state hadrons ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 ) @xcite or as gluon - tagged three - jet samples without hadron identification @xcite .",
    "this new situation motivated us to update , refine , and extend the bkk analysis @xcite by generating new lo and nlo sets of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 ffs .",
    "the @xmath11 distributions of the resulting ffs at their starting scales @xmath55 are given by eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) with the parameters listed in table  2 .",
    "the @xmath12 evolution is determined by the timelike altarelli - parisi equations in the respective orders , lo or nlo , which are summarized in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . should be replaced by @xmath56 . ] the evolution procedure in mellin space is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . a fortran subroutine which returns the values of the @xmath8 functions for given values of @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "may be downloaded from the url http://www.desy.de/~poetter/kkp.html or obtained upon request from the authors .    by also including in our fits @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 data ( without flavour separation ) from pep",
    "@xcite , with cm energy @xmath2  gev , we obtained a handle on the scaling violation in the fragmentation process , which allowed us to extract lo and nlo values of @xmath57 .",
    "we found @xmath58 at lo and @xmath59 at nlo , where the errors are experimental .",
    "these results are in perfect agreement with what the particle data group currently quotes as the world average , @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "our strategy was to only include in our fits lep1 and slc data with both flavour separation and hadron identification @xcite , gluon - tagged three - jet samples with a fixed gluon - jet energy @xcite , and the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 data sets from the pre - lep1/slc era with the highest statistics and the finest binning in @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "other data served us for cross checks .",
    "in particular , we probed the scaling violation through comparisons with @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath26 data from doris and petra , with cm energies between 5.4 and 34  gev @xcite . furthermore , we tested the gluon ff , which enters the unpolarized cross section only at nlo , by comparing our predictions for the longitudinal cross section , where it already enters at lo , with available data @xcite . finally , we directly compared our gluon ff with the one recently measured by delphi in three - jet production with gluon identification as a function of @xmath11 at various scales @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "all these comparisons led to rather encouraging results .",
    "we also verified that our ffs satisfy reasonably well the momentum sum rules , which we did not impose as constraints on our fits .",
    "all these cross checks make us believe that our ffs should allow for a reliable description of inclusive charged - hadron production in all kinds of high - energy - collision experiments over wide ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ". the very - high-@xmath12 regime will be accessible with the cern lhc and a future @xmath0 linear collider .",
    "our ffs are bound to break down at very low values of @xmath11 , where it becomes necessary to modify the ansatz  ( [ ansatz ] ) according to the mlla @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present analysis , but should eventually be investigated @xcite .      after the submission of this paper , a preprint @xcite appeared which also presents nlo ffs for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and charged hadrons .",
    "these ffs are fitted to the aleph @xcite , sld @xcite , and tpc @xcite data assuming certain power laws in the light - quark sector .",
