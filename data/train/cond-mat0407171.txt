    "the spontaneous magnetization of bulk ferromagnets has been successfully described by a heisenberg model within the framework of many - body green s function theory @xcite , where the tyablikov decoupling ( random phase approximation : rpa ) is the crucial approximation for the exchange energy term .",
    "usually , only the @xmath7-component of the magnetization @xmath8 was considered .",
    "callen@xcite developed a formalism which lead to a closed - form expression for the magnetization @xmath8 in ferromagnetic ( fm ) systems for any spin quantum number @xmath6 .",
    "this theory has been helpful in studying various systems described by heisenberg hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental work has provided an incentive to calculate more than one component of the magnetization .",
    "for example , under the influence of an external field perpendicular to the anisotropy axis , the magnetization rotates with the variation of the field strength .",
    "when a fm layer is covered by an anti - ferromagnetic layer , the magnetizations across the interface may have different orientations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the antiferromagnetic sublattice magnetization may be non - collinear @xcite . in fm ultrathin films ,",
    "the magnetization may rotate when the temperature or film thickness are varied ; see e.g.@xcite .",

    "@xcite have developed a method using green s function theory to calculate more than one component of the magnetization for fm films .",
    "they investigated the reorientation of the magnetization of fm films caused by an external field and the dipole - dipole coupling by applying rpa to the exchange energy term and the anderson - callen decoupling @xcite to an _ out - of - plane _ single - ion anisotropy .",
    "later an exact treatment of the single - ion anisotropy term was proposed by going to higher - order green s functions @xcite .",
    "this exact treatment and a comparison with quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite showed that the anderson - callen decoupling is a good approximation when the single - ion anisotropy is small compared to the exchange interaction .",
    "the anderson - callen decoupling can therefore often be a useful approximation in this situation , particularly as it is much simpler to apply than the exact treatment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , general analytical formulas were derived on the basis of rpa and the anderson - callen decoupling for the three components of the magnetization for 3d and 2d fm systems for any spin quantum number .",
    "the green s function formalism was also applied to uniaxial out - of - plane and uniaxial in - plane _ exchange _ anisotropies @xcite .    the papers above [ 12 - 17 ] dealt only with a uniaxial _ out - of - plane _ single - ion anisotropy . in the present paper",
    ", we generalize the model by introducing single - ion anisotropies in all directions of space , thus obtaining the in - plane and out - of - plane anisotropies as special cases , and also allowing for a reorientation of the magnetization from out - of - plane to in - plane and vice versa , depending on the chosen parameters .",
    "the new key features are the formulation in terms of green s functions defined in the spin operators @xmath9 instead of the @xmath10 operators , and the generalization of the anderson - callen decoupling to the terms coming from the single - ion anisotropies for all directions in space .",
    "the new formulation is advantageous if several non - vanishing components of the magnetization are present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "we also discuss the effects of the magnetic dipole - dipole coupling .",

    "the advantage of such operators is that the @xmath42 s are equivalent to each other . a particular direction in space is not preferred .",

    "it is unnecessary to plot the components of the magnetization as functions of the external field at various temperatures as in fig .",
    "4 ( the 3d case ) because they are qualitatively so similar .    in refs . @xcite",
    ", the case of the out - of - plane anisotropy was studied in detail . since the method developed in the present paper also enables the study of the in - plane anisotropy , it is natural to compare both cases .",
    "we mention the following differences , which can all be explained on the basis of eqs .",
    "the first concerns the case where there is no external field . for an out - of - plane anisotropy",
    ", there is a magnetization reorientation from the @xmath7-direction to the @xmath85-plane due to di even without an external field @xcite . at zero temperature , the magnetization points to the @xmath7-direction because of the out - of - plane anisotropy term @xmath209 . with increasing temperature",
    ", the magnetization turns to the @xmath85-plane owing to the di . in the case of in - plane anisotropy",
    ", there is no spin reorientation in the absence of the field , because the magnetization is already in the @xmath85-plane at zero temperature .",
    "secondly , with the same di strength and the same field ( perpendicular to the anisotropy direction ) , the magnetization reorientation temperature is different for the two anisotropy cases as shown in figure 7 . in fig.7(a ) and ( b ) , the solid lines are for @xmath157 and the dotted lines are for @xmath210 , both with @xmath193 .",
    "figure 7(a ) depicts the in - plane anisotropy case with an external field @xmath170 along the @xmath7-direction , and figure 7(b ) the out - of - plane anisotropy case with an external field @xmath211 along the @xmath89-direction .",
    "the magnetization reorientation temperature of the latter case is lower than that of the former case .",
    "this can be understood from eqs .",
    "( 55 ) , from which one sees that the dipole interaction enhances the effect of the in - plane anisotropy term , whereas the opposite is true for the out - of - plane case ; i.e. the role of di can be considered as a renormalization of the anisotropy terms in the following sense @xmath212    this also explains , thirdly , the effect of the variation in the strength of the di , as shown in figure 7(a ) and ( b ) . in the case of in - plane anisotropy , increasing the di strength hinders the reorientation from in - plane to out - of - plane , see fig.7(a ) , whereas the reorientation from out - of - plane to in - plane is enforced in the case of the out - of - plane anisotropy .",
    "it is seen that the di suppresses the out - of - plane anisotropy and enhances the in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the fourth difference involves the variation of the external field .",
    "if an external field @xmath213 is applied along the @xmath89-direction in the case of an out - of - plane anisotropy , the magnetization reorients easier with di than without di .",
    "this is shown by comparison of the dashed and solid lines in fig.8 .",
    "the reason is that we can also interpret the effect of the di as a renormalization of the external field , as has been done in ref.@xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ 55 ] ) @xmath214 this means that the effect of the di is to enhance a magnetic field in the @xmath215-plane , and to weaken an external field along the @xmath7-direction . therefore , if an external field @xmath179 is applied along the @xmath7-direction in the case of an in - plane anisotropy , it is more difficult for the magnetization to reorient into the out - of - plane direction with di than without di .",
    "comparison of the dotted and solid lines in fig.8 provides an example .",
    "in this paper , we have treated a heisenberg hamiltonian with single - ion anisotropies in all three directions of space by applying many - body green s function theory , thus generalizing previous work dealing with uniaxial out - of - plane anisotropy .",
    "to do so , we selected the spin operators @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath1 as basis operators to construct the green s functions instead of the commonly used operators @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath1",
    ". we stress that in the derivation of the formalism none of the three axes is special , so that we are always able to select a reference direction along which the magnetization component is not zero .",
    "the key is the generalization of the anderson - callen decoupling to the terms from the single - ion anisotropy in all directions of space , eqs.(11 , 12 ) .",
    "a formal advantage of the use of the present operators is that the matrix governing the equations of motion is hermitian , whereas the ususal formalism leads to real non - hermitian matrices , which are more difficult to treat .",
    "a main result of the paper is that analytical expressions can be derived for the three components of the magnetization and the correlations @xmath220 , @xmath92 and @xmath5 for any spin quantum number .",
    "the formalism obtained in this paper enables a treatment of both the in - plane and out - of - plane anisotropies .",
    "for the 2d system , we included the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "its effect on the magnetization can be explained on the basis of eq.([55 ] ) , and can be interpreted as a renormalization of the nondispersive part of the exchange interaction terms , or of the single - ion anisotropy terms or of the external field , see eqs.([57 ] , [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] ) .",
    "the reorientation of the magnetization from in - plane to out - of - plane under an external field occurs more easily without the di than with it , or in other words the di supports the reorientation from the out - of plane to the in - plane direction .    because of eq.(55 )",
    ", @xmath221 may appear negative . in this case",
    "the regularity condition eq.(28 ) would be meaningless because the @xmath7-component magnetization should be within @xmath222 .",
    "only when the value of @xmath194 is under a certain value can there is a non - zero @xmath223 without a field in @xmath7-direction . from eq.(58 ) , the condition should be @xmath224",
    ". then one should have @xmath225\\right ) >",
    "gt_0(1 + 2s)$ ] . since @xmath226",
    ", one has @xmath227 , where @xmath204 is taken .",
    "the upper limit increases with spin quantum number .",
    "however , because we use scaled parameters in this paper , eq.(52 ) , we have @xmath228 .",
    "the upper limit decreases with spin quantum number .",
    "when the value of @xmath194 is over this limit , the @xmath7-component of magnetization has to be zero .",
    "figure 5 provides an example where the magnetization lies in the plane .",
    "finally , we point out that the numerical results are all calculated with scaled parameters in order to obtain universal results , in accordance with refs.@xcite . with increasing @xmath6 , the scaled exchange @xmath53 and anisotropy",
    "@xmath152 become smaller as can be seen in eq.([52 ] ) .",
    "this results in the conclusions in section 3 that , with increasing @xmath6 , the following quantities decrease : the scaled @xmath158 in fig.1 , the effective anisotropy coefficients in figs.3 , 6 and 7 , and the field under which the reorientation occurs in fig.4 . if the parameters are not scaled but kept unchanged , the conclusions are the other way round .",
    "a larger @xmath6 means a larger magnetization .",
    "it will , therefore , result in a higher curie temperature .",
    "consequently , the effective anisotropy coefficients are larger for larger @xmath6 at a given temperature . for instance , at zero temperature , the effective anisotropy coefficient should be @xmath229 .",
    "a larger magnetization is more difficult to turn by an external field . as a result ,",
    "the magnitude of the field at which the magnetization reorientation occurs should rise with increasing @xmath6 for a given temperature .",
