[ halls ] and [ rho ] ) coincide with abrupt changes in the quantum oscillation frequencies and effective masses ( see table 1 in supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are related to modifications of the fs topology with the most drastic change occurring at @xmath35 where the hall effect collapses and @xmath27 has a pronounced minimum . </S>",
    "<S> the fs can be easily modified by applying a magnetic field and the small fs pockets disappear through a lt . </S>",

    "<S> as ucoge is a weak ferromagnet this effect will even be strengthened by the internal field . </S>",
    "<S> hence an important polarization of the bands can be achieved by easily accessible magnetic fields and thus a series of magnetic field - induced lt appears .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization up to 50@xmath38 t @xcite has a strongly non - linear field dependence suggesting that the electronic magnetic response must vary strongly with the magnetic field while the fm fluctuations are already fully suppressed for @xmath73  t along the @xmath0 axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the electronic instabilities seem to occur in the paramagnetic regime without any additional phase transitions and far above the field where the fm intersite magnetic correlations collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the key phenomenon is that fs changes are induced by crossing some critical values of magnetic polarization . </S>",
    "<S> such fs changes are accompanied by a metamagnetic - like transition depending on the nature of the electronic instability . </S>",
    "<S> very recent magnetization measurements @xcite point to a tiny metamagnetic - like transition at @xmath34 but do not detect any anomaly at @xmath33 and the high field measurements @xcite exclude it for @xmath35 and @xmath50 . the case of ucoge can be compared to the series of observed inside the hidden order phase of uru@xmath4si@xmath4 . in this compound </S>",
    "<S> no detectable effects on the bulk magnetization have been observed @xcite , but the lts are related to the polarization of the small fs pockets @xcite . in ceru@xmath4si@xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> the lt is linked to the pseudo - metamagnetic transition where one spin - split fs vanishes continuously at the transition @xcite , while in ybrh@xmath4si@xmath4 the lt @xcite goes along with a suppression of the local kondo effect as has been demonstrated by renormalized band structure calculations under magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a lt occurring at 28  t has been reported in paramagnetic ceirin@xmath74 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> different lda band structure calculations have been performed on ucoge @xcite showing strong differences in the fs topology . in the paramagnetic state three bands are contributing to fs sheets with rather small volume , characteristic for a low carrier or semimetallic system . </S>",
    "<S> two cigar - like @xcite or pillar - like @xcite fss centered around the @xmath22 point have been predicted which may correspond to the small fss observed below @xmath34 . in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> the fm state with a magnetic polarization along the @xmath0 axis has also been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the fss ( with a moment of @xmath75 much larger than in experiment ) differ significantly from the paramagnetic ones and do not at all agree with our experiment . in arpes experiments at zero field details of the fs could not be resolved up to now @xcite and it will be of great interest to see the differences of the fs above and below @xmath76 .    in conclusion , we give clear evidences by quantum oscillation experiments for fs instabilities under magnetic field in ucoge for field along the easy magnetization axis .    </S>",
