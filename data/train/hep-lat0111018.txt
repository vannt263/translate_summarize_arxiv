    "the effective infrared theory obtained after abelian projection must reproduce the low mass hadron spectrum at least in qualitative agreement with the real spectrum . to check this in the maximally abelian ( ma )",
    "projection @xcite we calculate glueball and gluelump spectrum in the abelian projected ( ap ) su(3 ) theory .",
    "we also discuss results for qcd with dynamical fermions .",
    "the glueball spectrum in ap @xmath1 theory has been studied in @xcite and good agreement with the @xmath1 spectrum has been found .",
    "the low hadron masses have been computed in ap @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this study , though being limited in precision , allows to draw conclusion about qualitative agreement with the spectrum of the unprojected theory .",
    "there is another motivation of our work .",
    "it has been claimed @xcite that since abelian projection breaks @xmath2 invariance ( even global ) the new hadronic states must appear in a theory which are absent in the experimental spectrum .",
    "we will suggest a solution of this problem .",
    "we follow the standard procedure of abelian projection for @xmath2 in ma gauge @xcite . to fix ma gauge a simulated annealing algorithm @xcite has been employed with the aim to reduce effects of gribov copies .",
    "we generated one gauge copy per configuration .",
    "our computations have been done on a @xmath3 lattice . in the quenched case we used @xmath4 configurations at @xmath5 . for the @xmath0",
    "full qcd @xmath6 configurations at @xmath7 generated by qcdsf @xcite have been used .",
    "these two sets have roughly equal lattice spacing with @xmath8 .",
    "let us introduce lattice gauge field @xmath9 and abelian projected field @xmath10 .",
    "the glueball correlator has a general form @xmath11 the zero momentum operator @xmath12 @xmath13 belongs to one of the three representations of the cubic group : @xmath14 . in ( [ glb_op ] ) closed paths @xmath15 and sign are chosen properly to get particular representation . to obtain the corresponding projected correlator we make the following substitution in ( [ glb_op ] ) : @xmath16 .",
    "we use square loops of a size up to @xmath17 and apply smearing or fuzzing to @xmath18 .",
    "finally , the effective mass is extracted as usual : @xmath19\\ ] ] in fig .  1 we present our results for projected @xmath20 for @xmath21 glueball .",
    "the straight lines show central value and error bars of the @xmath21 glueball mass obtained at this @xmath22 value in @xcite in the unprojected theory .",
    "one can see unusual behaviour of @xmath20 for smeared / fuzzed operators .",
    "this is due to lack of reflection positivity for gauge noninvariant operators used in our computations , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we found consistency between our results obtained with various operators which assures us that our computation of the glueball masses is meaningful .",
    "good agreement with results of @xcite can be seen from fig .  1 .",
    "similar agreement was found for @xmath23 and @xmath24 glueballs .",
    "we repeated our computation on full qcd configurations and obtained results consistent within error bars with results for the quenched case .",
    "the gluelump was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is not a physical particle .",
    "it can be seen as a glueball with one gluon infinitely massive or as a static adjoint quark with color screened by dynamical gluon field .",
    "its lowest energy determines a scale where adjoint string should break .",
    "the gluelump correlator has the following form : @xmath25 \\ s_{ab}(\\vec{x},t ) \\",
    "\\mbox{tr } \\left [ g(\\vec{x},t ) \\lambda_b \\right ] \\ ] ] @xmath26 the gluelump spectrum has been computed both in @xmath1 @xcite and in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath24 and @xmath27 gluelump correlators coincide with the gauge invariant correlators of the magnetic and electric fields @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 is a schwinger line . in the stochastic vacuum model",
    "@xcite the field strength correlator has exponential decay and determines the gluon correlation length @xmath31 @xcite . within the scope of this model",
    "@xmath31 is a fundamental parameter .",
    "the field strength correlator has been computed on the lattice .",
    "the lattice results for @xmath31 can be summarized as follows : in @xmath1 @xmath32 fm @xcite , in @xmath2 @xmath33 fm @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy of the gluelump , @xmath34 , is related to @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath35 the abelian projected gluelump correlator is : @xmath36 note the absence of the schwinger line in the projected correlator .",
    "this implies that the energy computed from this correlator has no divergent part .",
    "recently a connection between the field strength correlator and the dual photon propagator of an effective infrared qcd ( dual abelian higgs model ) has been suggested @xcite .",
    "if this is true , then the dual photon mass is equal to @xmath37 introduced above . in this sense",
    "we can say that the dual photon corresponds to the @xmath24 gluelump and thus is not observable .",
    "we computed correlators @xmath38 for @xmath39 gluelumps using the same techniques as in the computation of the projected glueball spectrum .    to compare with results of @xcite",
    "we need to subtract the divergent part from these results .",
    "this we make in the way applied to @xmath1 gluelumps in @xcite : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a selfenergy of the static adjoint quark - antiquark pair . to estimate @xmath41 we use the relation @xmath42 , which holds according to results of @xcite , and take the value @xmath43 from @xcite .",
    "our results presented in fig .  2 show good qualitative agreement with the @xmath2 spectrum of gluelumps obtained in @xcite .",
    "similar to the glueballs case the gluelump spectrum in ap qcd agrees well with results depicted in fig .  2 .",
    "+ it is easy now to suggest the interpretation of the new hadron states considered in @xcite , namely the states generated by operators @xmath44 .",
    "they are abelian projections of adjoint - mesons @xcite determined by the correlator @xmath45 s_{ab}(\\vec{x},t ) { \\mbox{tr}}\\left [ g_b(\\vec{x},t ) \\right ]   \\vspace{-.1cm}\\ ] ] @xmath46 after abelian projection the correlator is : @xmath47 { \\mbox{tr}}\\left [ g_\\alpha(\\vec{x},t ) \\right ] \\ ] ] the adjoint - baryons and their abelian projection can be constructed analogously . note that we always use weyl invariant operators since our gauge fixing does not break weyl invariance .",
    "our results for glueball and gluelump spectra in ap @xmath2 show good qualitative agreement with corresponding results obtained in @xmath2 . to make conclusion about how good agreement is quantitatively the extrapolation to the continuum limit",
    "would be necessary .",
    "similar computations made in ap full qcd at @xmath48 have not revealed any essential changes in the spectrum .",
    "we proposed solution of the problem of new hadrons , raised in @xcite : these states are abelian counterparts of gluelumps ( or adjoint mesons / baryons ) and thus can not be detected in experiments .",
