    "evidence is now emerging that ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) have an astrophysical origin , as opposed to being generated in exotic top - down models : the detection of a spectral suppression consistent with the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite by both hires  @xcite and auger  @xcite collaborations , together with the auger bounds on the uhe neutrino flux  @xcite , on the photon fraction  @xcite and on the anisotropy towards the galactic center  @xcite are all consistent with this scenario .",
    "the next step is clearly the identification of the sources of uhecrs , an arena where anisotropy studies play a crucial role .",
    "yet , the limited angular resolution of extensive air shower detectors and especially the deflections that charged particles suffer in astrophysical magnetic fields make the task highly non trivial .",
    "this is especially troublesome given that the uhecrs chemical composition is unknown , that we lack a detailed knowledge of the galactic magnetic field structure and , above all , of the very magnitude and structure of extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) outside of cluster cores .",
    "these limitations  together with the small statistics available at present  suggest that , at least in an initial phase , charged particle astronomy may be limited to the inference on the statistical properties of uhecr sources , rather than a detailed study of single accelerators .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that a global comparison of the two - point auto - correlation function of the data with the one of catalogues of potential sources is a powerful diagnostic tool : this observable is less sensitive to unknown deflections in magnetic fields than the cross - correlation function , while keeping a strong discriminating power among source candidates .",
    "in particular , the autocorrelation function of ( sub- ) classes of galaxies have different biases with respect to the large - scale structure ( lss ) of matter . as a result ,",
    "the best fit value for the density @xmath0 of different source classes may differ , especially if only one or a small range of angular scales is considered . although the bias of different source classes differs maximally at small angular scales , we showed that the statistically most significant differences are at intermediate angular scales , where both the larger number of cosmic ray pairs ( cr ) and of galaxy pairs leads to relatively smaller error bars .",
    "moreover , the autocorrelation function on larger angular scales becomes less dependent on possible deflections in the galactic and extragalactic fields .",
    "+ in this article we derive the number density of uhecr sources using the recently published arrival directions and energies of the 27 auger events  @xcite with estimated energy @xmath5eev , thereby complementing the study  @xcite with a concrete example for a comparison of the _ global _ cumulative autocorrelation function of sources and uhecrs .",
    "note that we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that , even in an idealized case where systematics play no major role , roughly three times the number of `` useful '' events that can be extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite are required to start distinguishing between different sub - classes of sources .",
    "thus a study of the kind envisaged in ref .",
    "@xcite is unrealistic at present . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to more modest goals : i ) to compare the data against predictions of two toy model cases of uniformly distributed sources and of `` normal galaxies '' ( i.e.  sources that have the same distribution as the pscz catalogue  @xcite ) which we shall refer to with the two values for the label @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "ii ) to study the effect on the allowed range of @xmath0 of a systematic error on the energy scale of the uhecr experiment . note that preliminary results of the clustering of the auger events has been presented in @xcite , but astrophysical implications have not been discussed there .",
    "we review the statistical method we use in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] , and apply it in sec .  [ int ] to the auger data , providing some interpretation of the results . in sec .",
    "[ disc ] we discuss some limitations and caveats of the analysis .",
    "finally , we summarize in sec .",
    "the use of correlation functions is well suited to the study of over- and underdensities of non - uniformly distributed sources and of the resulting anisotropies in the radiation received from them . since the number of cr events published by auger is still small , we use in our analysis following ref",
    ".  @xcite the _ cumulative _ two - point autocorrelation function @xmath7 defined as ( ) = _ i=2^n_j=1^i-1(-_ij ) , i.e.  the number of pairs within the angular distance @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the number of crs considered , @xmath10 is the angular distance between events @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the step function ( with @xmath14 ) .",
    "this function is straightforward to compute for the data , and denoted then by @xmath15 . for a specific model hypothesis @xmath16 , a set of functions @xmath17",
    "is obtained in the following way : sources with equal luminosities are distributed within a sphere of @xmath18mpc either uniformly or following the three - dimensional lss as given by a smoothed version  @xcite of the pscz catalogue  @xcite . for the lss case ( but not for the uniform case ) sources and cr events within the pscz mask are excluded , leaving 22 cr events .",
    "note that the mask mostly overlaps with the galactic plane and bulge region , where larger deflections due to the galactic magnetic field are expected : the mask is thus not only a catalogue limitation , but also implements to some extent a physically motivated angular cut .",
    "finally , each source @xmath19 , at redshift @xmath20 , is weighted by the factor [ weight ] _",
    "e_i(e_cut , z_k)^ e^-s de accounting for its redshift dependent flux suppression and the cr energy losses .",
    "these are parametrized as a continuous process in term of the function @xmath21 which gives the initial injection energy @xmath22 for a particle leaving the source at @xmath20 and arriving at the earth with energy @xmath23 .",
    "further details are given in  @xcite .",
    "the injection spectral index @xmath24 is assumed to be the same for all the sources and equal to 2.0 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath24 is however weak as shown in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "this procedure defines the model , while a single random realization is obtained by choosing the observed number of events from the sources according to the source weights and the declination - dependent auger experimental exposure .",
    "the model thus depends directly only on @xmath0 and the choice between sources distributed uniformly or according to the pscz catalogue ( of course , implicitly it also depends on the assumptions of sufficiently small magnetic field deflections ) .",
    "additionally , the model depends via the weights of eq .",
    "( [ weight ] ) on the type of primary particle , the energy spectrum of the sources , and the energy scale and cut @xmath25 .",
    "the latter dependence arises , because the energy scale of cr experiments has a relatively large systematic error that is difficult to determine .",
    "in particular , it has been argued  @xcite that the energy scale of auger should be shifted up by 3040% to obtain agreement with the spectral shape predicted by @xmath26 pair production  @xcite and the cr flux measured by other experiments .",
    "therefore we use two different values for the energy cut , @xmath27eev assuming that the energy calibration of auger is correct and @xmath28eev inspired by the dip interpretation .",
    "we do not include in this work the finite energy resolution of the auger experiment that is of order 20% in @xmath29 .",
    "a finite energy resolution would result in an effective decrease of the nominal energy cut due to the steeply falling cr spectrum and to a larger gzk horizon  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we do not account for the stochasticity of the energy loss in the photo - pion production process .",
    "both of the effects are subdominant at the moment with the present low statistics while a more careful analysis will be needed in the future when more data is available . for",
    "a rough estimate of the influence of both effects on @xmath0 one may compare how the 30% up - ward shift of @xmath25 from 60 to 80eev changes @xmath0 .",
    "finally , throughout this work we consider proton primaries , but note that the combination of nuclei with large deflections and few sources has been advocated too  @xcite .",
    "a further brief discussion of this point is postponed to sec .",
    "[ chemadd ] .",
    "the cumulative autocorrelation of the data @xmath15 , which is a single , one - dimensional function , has now to be compared with the hypothesis @xmath16 , for which we have various monte carlo realizations @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( we use typically @xmath32 ) . a standard method to compare data and",
    "model is to use angular bins @xmath33 so that to substitute the continuous function @xmath7 with the discrete set of values @xmath34 .",
    "the monte carlo realizations can then be used to calculate the marginalized probability distribution of each single @xmath35 or , if required , the joint probability distribution of two @xmath36 variables @xmath37 , three @xmath36 variables or more . in practice , to derive the best fit value @xmath0 as well as the goodness - of - fit for the chosen hypothesis @xmath16 a possible way is to calculate the mean @xmath38 and the variance @xmath39 per bin as well as the correlation matrix @xmath40 and then to perform a @xmath41 test .",
    "however , the difficulty to deal with such an high dimensional probability space and the generally strong non - gaussianity of the probability distribution make the @xmath41 method clearly not optimal for the problem at hand .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in this article , we assumed dominant proton primary as a basic working hypothesis .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the experimental situation on the chemical composition at uhe is far from settled : while anisotropy data point to a relatively light composition , the results of the fluorescence detector of the pierre auger collaboration favor a significant fraction of heavy nuclei  @xcite . yet , for the interpretation of these results one must rely on simulations employing hadronic interaction models .",
    "these are not based on a first - principle theory , rather on models calibrated on `` low - energy '' collider data , then _ extrapolated _ about two orders of magnitude beyond the center of mass energies experimentally probed .",
    "a proper quantitative assessment on how our conclusions vary in a mixed composition scenario goes beyond the purpose of the present paper . yet , at a qualitative level , we can note that several effects would come into play .",
    "first of all , in the unrealistic case where one could forget about magnetic deflections , the major effect would be a reduction of the energy - loss horizon ( but for iron , whose horizon is similar to the proton one ) .",
    "this should _ enhance _ the anisotropy pattern , due to the prominence of nearby accelerators .    when including ( the poorly known ) magnetic fields , two additional effects are relevant : i ) for a given energy , the higher the charge the larger the deflection and hence the loss of information at _ small _ angular separations .",
    "quantifying how large is this scale is a difficult task .",
    "we note that protons of these energies in the sole galactic field likely suffer a few degrees absolute deflections , see  @xcite , implying a degree - scale smoothing in the relative deflections important for the 2pcf .",
    "this is comparable with the angular resolution of the pao : in this optimal case the whole information in the 2pcf starting at @xmath42 could be used .",
    "however , a different galactic field model ( especially towards the galactic center ) , the presence of heavy nuclei , and/or significant extragalactic magnetic fields can easily lift @xmath43 by one order of magnitude or more .",
    "ii ) the other effect is that the real path - length of the nucleus would be longer than the distance to the source : thus , the distance of accessible sources would be even shorter than estimated from energy - loss considerations .",
    "this is particularly relevant if the nucleus spends a lot of time in a magnetized region surrounding the accelerator ( e.g. a magnetized cluster in which it is immersed ) before escaping in the intergalactic medium .",
    "finally , if the maximal energy of acceleration of different species of nuclei fall by unfortunate coincidence in the same region expected for the gzk feature , slightly different energy cuts in the data ( as well as statistical and systematic errors on the energy scale ) might significantly change the expected pattern of anisotropies .",
    "the same happens if the proportions of different nuclei accelerated at the source change as a function of the energy .",
    "this is in principle a possibility , especially if different classes of objects contribute to the events at slightly different energies .",
    "the general pessimistic conclusion is that if several of the above effects are relevant ( or perhaps a single one is _",
    "dominant _ ) the capability of performing uhecr astronomy would be greatly reduced .",
    "while one still expects indications for anisotropies , inverting the problem and inferring the source / propagation medium properties would require a much larger statistics ( especially in the trans - gzk region ) : disentangling the different effects is in fact a formidable task .    to provide a glimpse of how some of the above effects alter the reconstruction of @xmath0 ( our main topic here ) , in table  [ tab:2 ] we report how the constraint on @xmath0 degrades as a function of a `` smoothing angle '' @xmath43 , below which we assume that the 2pcf information is completely lost .",
    "the main trend is that , if the smallest angular scales are neglected , it is easier to find parameter configuration fitting the data and , correspondingly , the allowed range for @xmath0 widens .",
    "this had to be expected , given the shape of the correlation functions shown in figs . 2 - 3 .",
    "in particular we find that with @xmath44 we obtain almost the same results as in the global case .",
    "the case @xmath45 still places useful constraints especially for the @xmath46eev case , while finally using only the information above @xmath47 basically no constraints on @xmath0 are obtained .",
    "note however that relative deflection angles of that sort would imply overall deflections even larger , seriously questioning the perspectives of present instruments to perform some form of uhecr astronomy .",
    "we used the first uhe data released by auger to perform a _ global _ autocorrelation study of uhecr arrival directions , assuming proton primaries .",
    "the major advantage of our tool is that no biases are introduced by the _ a priori _ choice of a single angular scale .",
    "the main observable we have focused on is the number density @xmath0 of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) sources . while the global analysis does not bias @xmath0 by what is the theoretical prior of the `` relevant '' angular scale , still it is important to establish how the extraction of the allowed range of @xmath0 from the data depends on a number of other effects , an issue often overlooked in the literature .",
    "in particular , here we discussed the systematic energy scale uncertainty and of the bias of uhecr sources with respect to large scale structures .",
    "as a first attempt to extract some information from the data , we compared four hypotheses : a structured universe ( following the pscz catalogue ) and an isotropic case , each for two possible values for the absolute energy scale of the pao experiment .",
    "the density @xmath0 is the free continuous parameter in terms of which constraints have been analyzed .",
    "not surprisingly , we find that the number of crs usable for this analysis is still small and all four hypotheses are compatible with the data at the @xmath48 level for some range of @xmath0 . yet , several interesting observations can be tentatively drawn .",
    "the best fit is achieved for sources following the matter tracer distribution , and a source density @xmath49/mpc@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the data show some preference ( although not significant , yet ) for a structured universe : other recent statistical studies , like  @xcite , qualitatively agree in that respect .",
    "also , there is indication that the case of a uniform distribution of  infinitely many \" sources ( @xmath50 each with an infinitesimal luminosity ) , is excluded for both energy cuts at the 95% c.l . :",
    "the upper bound is @xmath51mpc@xmath52 .",
    "this is another way to say that early auger data suggest that data are poorly consistent with a structureless uhecr sky , independently of the use of a catalogue and of a pre - determined angular scale for the search .",
    "compared to a benchmark number density of proton sources @xmath53mpc@xmath3 , a factor @xmath54 lower densities are preferred if the current auger energy scale is correct , a factor @xmath54 higher value if it is underestimated as required by the _ dip _ model .",
    "including the finite energy resolution of the auger experiment into the analysis will reduce further the best fit value for @xmath0 .",
    "the width of the allowed region is dominated at present by the statistical error due to the small number of events .",
    "nominally , approximately a three times larger sample is needed to reduce the poisson error below the typical differences between source candidates .",
    "once that level of statistics is reached , other effects will provide the main source of error , a major one being the systematics on the energy scale as we illustrated here . in the future ,",
    "other effects such as the systematic and statistical errors in the energy determination of uhecr events and the stochastic nature of the photo - pion process need to be included to correctly determine the best fit value of @xmath0 . even considering the above limitations ,",
    "preliminary conclusions are the following : first , the fit generally improves for sources following the lss compared to uniformly distributed sources ; qualitatively , for agns which are known to be even more overdensity - biased than the lss ( see e.g. discussion in @xcite ) , the agreement is expected to improve even further . in particular , the case of an uniform distribution of  infinitely many \" sources , i.e.  a structureless uhecr sky , is excluded at 99% c.l .",
    "second , the absence of clustering on scales smaller than a few degrees is most easily understood as the effect of magnetic smearing of comparable size .",
    "this , intriguingly , suggests that autocorrelation studies can be employed as a complementary tool to study galactic ( and extragalactic ) magnetic fields .",
    "conclusions about the source scenario are complicated by the the limited knowledge of the egmfs and the presence of beaming and/or bursting effects which are difficult to disentangle with the use of the autocorrelation alone .",
    "hence , the true source density could be somewhat lower that the best fit value found : the energy scale error alone shifts the best fit value by a factor two or three ; luminosity function effects are likely relevant , too .",
    "the scarce statistics at the moment is a serious limiting factor to constrain more realistic models , but with a greater exposure of currently existing instruments and the multi - messenger combination of gamma - ray and neutrino data , some of these issues will probably be addressed and solved in the near future .    for a significant contamination of nuclei in the sample ,",
    "a much more complicated analysis is needed , since many more variables enter the game .",
    "qualitatively , one can expect that although future data might allow to disentangle a proton - dominated sample from a more complicated picture , inferring source properties and disentangling them from magnetic effects ( in a few words , performing uhecr astronomy ) should wait for a major jump in exposure , perhaps beyond the capabilities of currently planned instruments .",
    "similar considerations apply unfortunately to the constraints to the cross sections of uhecrs as well .",
