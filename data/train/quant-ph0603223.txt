    "one of the basic problems in quantum information theory @xcite concerns the issue of additivity of classical capacity of quantum channels .",
    "a basic question is whether the use of entangled states as optimal states for encoding classical information can increase the capacity of a channel or not . a proper calculation of the so called schumacher - westmoreland - holevo capacity @xcite,@xcite requires the optimization of mutual information between the input and output of the channel when we encode the information into arbitrary long strings of quantum states ( more precisely states in the tensor product of the hilbert space of one state ) and carrying out the limiting procedure @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the capacity of the channel when we send @xmath2 strings of quantum states into the channel .",
    "here @xmath3 is the ensemble of input states , @xmath4 is the mutual information between the input and the output , when the channel maps each input state @xmath5 into the output state @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the von neumann entropy of a state @xmath8 .",
    "we should stress that ( [ 1 ] ) may not be the proper definition for capacity in a memory channel as formulated in its most general setting in @xcite , however such a definition seems to be still valid for generic memory channels @xcite .",
    "+ calculation of @xmath9 is extremely difficult if not impossible .",
    "a much simpler problem is to calculate @xmath10 , and to see if entangled states can enhance this kind of limited capacity or not .",
    "this problem has been tackled by many authors @xcite and there is now strong support for a conjecture that if the noise of the channel is not correlated , i.e for product channels , entangled states have no advantage over separable states for encoding classical information .",
    "however when the noise is correlated , several examples have been provided which indicate that entanglement can enhance the mutual information , if the correlation is above a certain critical value . to our knowledge these examples are limited to qubit channels @xcite,@xcite , and bosonic gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "+ it is a nontrivial problem to find examples which show such a transition .",
    "the difficulty in finding more examples resides in the large number of parameters over which the required optimization should be carried out . in fact one has to propose a channel and a certain type of correlation and only after carrying out the optimization for all values of the noise parameters and correlation values one can see if a critical value of correlation exists above which entangled states are advantageous over separable states .",
    "when one goes to higher dimensional states , the number of parameters increases and the problem becomes even more intractable . therefore it is desirable to have a systematic method for constructing such channels .",
    "this is a problem which we study in this paper . + we will find a general class of channels for which there is a sharp transition , reminiscent of phase transitions , at which the optimal state changes abruptly from a separable state to a maximally entangled state .",
    "this transition always happens regardless of the value of noise parameters .",
    "therefore it is remarkable that the struggle for optimality is between these two extremes of entanglement and not between other intermediate values .",
    "+ the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ( [ performance ] ) we first use the minimum output entropy as a parameter characterizing the performance of the channel @xcite .",
    "since an input state usually becomes entangled with the environment at the output and the state of the environment is not accessible , minimum entropy at the output means that minimum information has leaked to the environment .",
    "+ we then provide a general class of channels which are guaranteed to show such transitions in their performance . in section ( [ capacity ] )",
    "we show that for a subclass of these channels , i.e. those for which the kraus operators form an irreducible representation of a group and commute modulo a phase with each other , the minimization of output entropy is equivalent to the maximization of the mutual information , hence we show that in the models which we study , which are among the above subclass , it is really the mutual information that behaves non - analytically . in section ( [ qubit ] )",
    "we study a pauli channel for qubits with only bit - flip and phase flip errors and show that it shows such a transition . finally in section ( [ arbitrary ] )",
    "we go to arbitrary dimensions and study a subclass of generalized pauli channels having a symmetry . for this subclass ,",
    "still satisfying the group representation property , we do the main part of the analysis analytically and only at the end use numerical calculations .",
    "figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show some of our results",
    ". + we should be clear that these and previous similar results on enhancement of mutual information do not directly address the problem of additivity of entropy , since this property deals with sending entangled states over a product channel and not a correlated one .",
    "in arbitrary dimensions consider the following two channels , each of them acts on a single quantum state : @xmath11 we take the kraus operators @xcite @xmath12 , to be unitary operators and @xmath13 .",
    "we now consider the channel @xmath14 acting on two states as follows :    @xmath15    where    @xmath16    this type of correlation is inspired by the work of @xcite who first proposed it for the pauli channels .",
    "the basic difference however is that our product channel ( for @xmath17 ) is @xmath18 rather than @xmath19 , and for @xmath20 error operators are of the form @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "one can not however attach the same physical interpretation as authors of @xcite did for this kind of channel , that is one can not interpret this channel as two consecutive uses of the channel @xmath23 in equation ( [ kraus ] ) .",
    "however this practical problem is of minor importance , as long as we are interested in the non - analytical behavior of this channel .",
    "+ to study the performance of this channel we use minimum output entropy as explained in the introduction .",
    "that is we search for input states which give the minimum entropy among all output states .",
    "+ we know that when @xmath17 , the channel ( [ erho ] ) is a product channel , and for these channels , there is strong analytical and numerical support @xcite that the optimal input states of the two channels when multiplied by each other give the best input state of the product channel in the sense that it gives the minimum output entropy . on the other hand",
    "we know that when @xmath20 , the maximally entangled states pass through the channel without any distortion .",
    "this is due to the easily proved identity that for any such state , namely for any state of the form @xmath24 and for any unitary operator @xmath25 @xmath26 thus we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "however this does not by itself prove that at @xmath20 separable states may not be optimal , since they may have vanishing output entropy at @xmath20 , too . if we can prove that at @xmath20 , no separable state gives a vanishing output entropy , then we conclude that somewhere in the interval @xmath29 $ ] , a transition occurs in the behavior of the channel . this by itself does not imply that this transition should be abrupt , however our examples clearly indicate such an abrupt transition .",
    "+ in order to present our next result , we need a definition .",
    "let us choose an arbitrary kraus operator say @xmath30 from the set of @xmath12 s describing the channel .",
    "for each @xmath31 we define the set of states which are invariant modulo a phase under the action of @xmath32 , that is @xmath33    then the condition under which a transition occurs is simply given in the following + * theorem * : if @xmath34 then there is a transition in the optimal input states , which improve the channel performance , from separable to maximally entangled states as we increase the level of correlation . + * proof * : we want to show that under this condition no separable input state leads to an output state of vanishing entropy .",
    "let @xmath35 be a general separable state . by definition",
    "it can be written as a convex combination of pure product states , namely @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are pure . if @xmath39 , then we find from concavity of @xmath40 that @xmath41    in view of positivity of @xmath40 this means that for all @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "thus we should consider only separable states of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both pure .",
    "+ when @xmath20 such a state transforms to the output state @xmath47    again using concavity of @xmath40 we have    @xmath48    with equality only if all the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 are independent of the index @xmath31 . + this is possible only if we can find a pure state @xmath51 which transforms to the same state @xmath52 under the action of all the operators @xmath12 , i.e. if @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "this last condition is however exactly equivalent to the existence of a state @xmath51 which is invariant modulo a phase under all the operators @xmath32 for an arbitrarily chosen @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56    therefore if @xmath34 , no separable state can achieve zero entropy at the output of the channel and a critical value of @xmath57 certainly exists .",
    "+ note that this theorem by itself does not imply that such a transition is sharp , however the examples of @xcite and those presented here suggest such a conclusion .",
    "as an example , we are certain that in two dimensions , a channel with kraus operators @xmath58 will show a transition while a channel with kraus operators @xmath59 will not , a result which we have seen in our numerical searches of optimal states .",
    "if we impose some extra conditions on the kraus operators and follow the arguments in @xcite , we can show that minimum output entropy is equivalent to maximal mutual information in the channel .",
    "thus for these kinds of channels the conditions stated in our theorem also guarantee an enhancement of mutual information .",
    "+ following @xcite we note that the first term of mutual information ( [ mutual ] ) , is maximized if @xmath60 .",
    "therefore an upper bound is found for the mutual information in the form @xmath61    let us suppose that the kraus operators in equation ( [ kraus ] ) have the following two properties : ( a ) commute with each other modulo a phase : @xmath62 , and ( b ) form an irreducible representation of a group .",
    "+ using property ( a ) and defining an equiprobable input ensemble @xmath63 in which @xmath64 it is straightforward to show that for @xmath14 defined in equation ( [ erho ] ) we have : @xmath65 this mean that the channel @xmath14 in covariant with respect to the kraus operators @xmath12 .",
    "since entropy is invariant under unitary operations , we conclude that @xmath66 therefore if @xmath35 minimizes the output entropy all the @xmath67 do that , too .",
    "+ as a consequence of the second property of the kraus operators , we find that the state @xmath68 with all @xmath69 s equal , commutes with all the operators @xmath70 and hence by schur s first lemma it is a multiple of identity , @xmath71 from ( [ mutual ] ) , ( [ sterm ] ) and ( [ fterm ] ) we see that the upper bound of equation ( [ bound ] ) is attainable if we use @xmath67 with the same probability as the input states .",
    "this means that to maximize the mutual information , we only need to find a state @xmath35 which minimizes the output entropy .",
    "+ the examples which we present in the following sections are of this type and hence the transition observed in their behavior as measured in the minimum output entropy is in fact a transition in their mutual information .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite two examples of qubit channels which have such a critical correlation have been studied .",
    "we introduce a third example .",
    "let us take the error operators to be @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the identity matrix and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the pauli matrices .",
    "these errors happen with probability @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , with @xmath79 .",
    "this is a channel with only bit - flip and phase - flip operators .",
    "it is easily verified that this channel satisfies the criteria mentioned in the previous section .",
    "we expect this channel to show a transition as we increase the correlation parameter @xmath57 . to see this we take a general pure state of two qubits @xmath80 and calculate the output state .",
    "the eigenvalues of the output density matrix can not be determined analytically and have to be evaluated numerically for fixed correlation parameter @xmath57 and error parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 for all states . for each set of these parameters",
    "we find the optimal state , i.e. the input state which yields the output state with minimum entropy .",
    "the result is shown in figure ( [ min - ent-1 ] ) where we have fixed error parameters to @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "+ it is seen that there is a sharp transition for optimal input state at @xmath83 from separable states to maximally entangled states .",
    "in this section we analyze correlated pauli channels in arbitrary dimensions and study in more detail a 3 dimensional channel , which shows such a critical transition . + in general for a generalized pauli channel carrying @xmath84 dimensional states ( with basis states @xmath85 ) , the error operators are the generalized pauli operators @xmath86 defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "these operators have well - known properties , including @xmath89    and satisfy the conditions in section ( [ capacity ] ) .",
    "the effect of a pauli channel on a single qudit is defined as @xmath90 with @xmath91 .    in order to simplify the calculations",
    "we can restrict ourselves to a subclass of such channels which have a symmetry .",
    "let us assume that such a channel has a symmetry of the form    @xmath92    for @xmath93 belonging to an index set representing the symmetry group @xmath94",
    ". then if @xmath35 is an optimal state , @xmath95 will also be an optimal state , where @xmath96 is the order of the group",
    ". moreover the state @xmath97 is invariant , that is @xmath98 .",
    "this invariance greatly facilitates our analytical or numerical search for optimal states .",
    "+ in the pauli channel let us consider a subclass for which @xmath99 .",
    "this is a generalization of the channel studied in @xcite . in this subclass",
    "we have the following symmetry @xmath100 this symmetry also exists when the channel ( [ dpauli ] ) acts on two qudits in the presence of correlated noise . in that case",
    "it takes the form @xmath101 since @xmath102 this symmetry is generated by only one single element namely @xmath103 and we can search for the optimal input state among those which have the following symmetry .",
    "@xmath104    a simple calculation in the basis in which @xmath103 is diagonal shows that the state @xmath97 is nothing but a convex combination of pure states of the following form    @xmath105    following the reasoning of @xcite we can take the optimal state to be a pure state which we take to be of the form @xmath106 , without loss of generality . to find the output state we calculate the correlated and uncorrelated parts of the channel separately .",
    "for the correlated part we find @xmath107 for the uncorrelated part we have @xmath108 since @xmath109    we find @xmath110    as in ( [ erho ] ) the complete output of the channel will be    @xmath111    one can now determine the entropy of this output state and minimize it with respect to the coefficients @xmath112 to determine the optimal input state and its entanglement . this part of the problem must usually be carried out numerically .",
    "we have done this task for 3 level states ( qutrits ) , where the matrix of error parameters take the form @xmath113    for fixed error parameters , and for variable values of the correlation parameters @xmath57 , we have searched numerically among all the states which minimize the output entropy .",
    "figure ( [ ist - symmetry ] ) shows the entropy of the output state when the optimal state is fed into the channel . for each @xmath57",
    "the entanglement of the optimal input state is also plotted .",
    "it is clearly seen that there is a sharp transition at @xmath114 .",
    "below @xmath115 the optimal state is a separable state and above @xmath115 it is a maximally entangled state .",
    "this plot is typical , changing the error parameters only changes the value of critical correlation @xmath115 .",
    "note that in calculating the entanglement of the input state we have used logarithms to base 2 so that a maximally entangled state has an entanglement of @xmath116 .",
    "+ the interesting features are that first , the transition is sharp and not smooth and second no matter what the error parameters are , it is the maximally entangled states and not some other states with lower values of entanglement which minimize the output entropy and hence maximize the mutual information . therefore the transition is governed by a struggle of the two extremes of entanglement . + before concluding the paper it is instructive to compare the fidelity of the output and input states and also the linearized entropies of the output state for two extreme cases , namely when the input state is completely separable and when it is a maximally entangled state .",
    "this will provide us with a very simple way to obtain an estimate of the critical value of correlation .",
    "+ for the maximally entangled state @xmath117 where @xmath118 , we put @xmath119 in ( [ phic ] ) and ( [ product ] ) and find @xmath120    where @xmath121    for a separable state @xmath122 we find    @xmath123    where @xmath124 .",
    "( other separable states like @xmath125 give different output states but the same output entropy ) .",
    "for the maximally entangled state the fidelity will be    @xmath126    and the linearized entropy @xmath127 will be @xmath128\\ ] ] while for separable states the corresponding quantities will be @xmath129    and @xmath130.\\ ] ] for the 3 dimensional channel that we have studied with the parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 we have plotted in figure ( [ purity ] ) and ( [ fidelity ] ) the linearized entropies of these two output states and their fidelity with their input states .",
    "+ we see that the maximally entangled states have a higher fidelity than separable states at the output for all values of @xmath57 , however their output linearized entropy becomes less than that of the separable states at almost the same critical value of @xmath133 which we found by considerations of minimum von - neumann entropy .",
    "+ therefore it may be possible to analyze more complicated channels , those without symmetry and in arbitrary dimensions , in a much simpler way , i.e. by searching for optimal states either numerically or analytically , according to the minimality of their linearized and not von - neumann entropy .",
    "we have provided conditions under which a channel with correlated noise shows a sharp transition in the form of its optimal states , as the level of correlation passes a critical value .",
    "the interesting point is that the transition occurs from completely separable states to maximally entangled states and not states with some intermediate value of entanglement , depending on the values of error parameters .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of phase transitions . in the same way that in phase transitions there is a struggle between order and disorder , i.e. between energy and entropy",
    ", here there is a struggle between maximal entanglement and complete separability .",
    "one is tempted to link this to a symmetry breaking phenomenon . in ferromagnetic phase transitions",
    "we know that the free energy changes its shape when we lower the temperature below the critical temperature , and a unique minimum ( with zero magnetization ) bifurcates to a a manifold of minima ( with non - zero magnetization ) .",
    "is there a similar function here defined on the space of states or their entanglement which undergo a similar change when we increase the level of correlation ?",
    "we think that this question deserves much further investigation .",
