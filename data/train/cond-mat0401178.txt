    "the critical phenomena , typical of many body systems , have attracted remarkable scientific interest since a long time .",

    "the reliable range of @xmath5 values also decreases as the system size increases  @xcite . a qualitative study in ref .",
    "has shown that reweighting causes a systematic shift in the height and the location of the specific heat peak , which depends on the relative position of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that the shift decreases as  @xmath11 only for @xmath0 much larger than the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "systematic errors , eventually affected by sampling autocorrelations , may also take place at finite @xmath0 . the first quantitative study of the statistical errors in reweighted data  @xcite has demonstrated that theoretical calculation of the error is both difficult and time consuming so it may not be justified for all studies . in this paper",
