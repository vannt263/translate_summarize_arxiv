    "it is remarkable that the neutral boson with a mass of 125126 gev , measured at the lhc in the diphoton , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels ( hereafter denoted by @xmath3 ) @xcite , can be interpreted as the higgs particle of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , due to the well known problems of quadratic divergences related to the higgs mass , a pressing question is whether this newly discovered higgs  like particle can be interpreted within a supersymmetric extension of the sm , where the problem of divergences would be solved by boson  fermion loop cancellations .",
    "should this be the case , a very rich and intriguing phenomenology would open up @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate this possibility in detail , also in connection with possible implications for supersymmetric candidates of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "we employ a simple supersymmetric model , which we already used in previous analyses @xcite , consisting in an effective minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) at the electroweak ( ew ) scale , where the usual hypothesis of gaugino  mass unification at the scale of grand unification ( gut ) of a supergravity ( sugra ) model , is removed ; this effective mssm is very manageable , since expressible in terms of a limited number of independent parameters .",
    "the higgs sector of this mssm has two higgs doublets , which generate , by spontaneous symmetry breaking , two vev s : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these provide masses to the down  type quarks and the up  type quarks , respectively . as usual , an angle @xmath6 is introduced and defined as @xmath7 .",
    "this higgs sector contains three neutral bosons : two cp  even , @xmath8 , and a cp - odd one @xmath9 .",
    "the two cp  even higgs bosons are defined , in terms of the neutral components of the original higgs doublets , as : @xmath10 , @xmath11 . in the diagonalization of their mass matrix ,",
    "the mass hierarchy @xmath12 is imposed , and the angle @xmath13 is taken in the range @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath15 can be established using the lep data on the search for higgs particles @xcite .",
    "contrary to the usual assumption ( employed in most of the literature until very recently ) of assuming for this lower limit the _ standard model _",
    "bound @xmath16 114 gev , in our previous works ( and in the present one ) we take the actual lep constraint on the higgs  production cross sections , that can be translated into a bound on the quantity @xmath17 as a function of @xmath15 ( this quantity represents the ratio of the cross section for the higgs  strahlung process @xmath18 to the corresponding sm cross section ; a complementary bound arises from the process @xmath19 , and it is also taken into account ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite we showed that the lep limit actually allows the mass @xmath20 to reach values as low as 90 gev in some regions of the supersymmetric parameter space in mssm , where the phenomenology of neutralino dm is particularly interesting .",
    "the atlas and cms data exclude that the boson @xmath9 can be identified with the new particle @xmath3 , but we are left with the two options : either @xmath21 ( hereafter denoted as scenario i ) or @xmath22 ( scenario ii ) .    as pointed out in ref .",

    "@xcite . as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , the light @xmath25 boson of this scenario could be the origin of the small excess of higgs  like events observed at lep @xcite .",
    "the second option is represented by scenario ii : this scenario occurs , when the higgs  like boson observed at lhc is identified with the lighter cp  even boson @xmath25 within the mssm @xcite . in this case , @xmath26 gev and @xmath9 , @xmath27 can also decouple substantially from @xmath25 , but with @xmath28 .",
    "in this paper we analyse separately scenarios i and ii , critically discussing the role of the various experimental data ( mainly obtained at colliders and at b  factories ) which provide actual or potential constraints to supersymmetric properties . for each scenario the properties of neutralinos as dm particles",
