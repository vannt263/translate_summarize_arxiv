    "the renewed interest in the casimir effect @xcite in the last 15 years has fueled numerous complementary studies on different aspects of this long - range interaction . during the last decade or so various papers",
    "have focused on the entropy related to the casimir interactions between two solid bodies @xcite .",
    "an important reason for this interest lies in the fact that the casimir entropy can reach negative values .",
    "this effect has first been theoretically discussed for two plates modelled by drude - type metals @xcite .",
    "its origin lies in the suppression of the reflectivity of the transverse electric mode at low frequencies due to a finite zero - frequency conductivity @xcite .",
    "if the conductivity diverges in the low - frequency limit , as is the case for perfect metals or metals within the plasma model , the entropy in the plane - plane configuration will remain positive for all temperatures @xcite .",
    "the existence of a negative casimir entropy in this geometry is therefore related to the dissipation inside the metal .",
    "however dissipation is not the only mechanism giving rise to negative casimir entropies . for the casimir - polder interaction between an atom and a perfect - metal plate , negative values of the entropy",
    "were found at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "studies of the sphere - plane configuration @xcite and the sphere - sphere configuration @xcite for perfect reflectors demonstrated that negative casimir entropies can be of purely geometric origin . considering the large - distance limit",
    ", we shall see that in these geometries the casimir entropy can become negative for perfect metals , but it remains positive if both objects involved are described by the drude model implying a finite zero - frequency conductivity .",
    "another indication of a negative casimir entropy is given by the non - monotonic behavior of the thermal casimir force . such a behavior has been found in the electromagnetic case in the sphere - plane geometry @xcite as well as for a scalar field satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions in the sphere - plane and the cylinder - plane geometries @xcite .    in the present paper we will study in more detail the geometrical origin of negative casimir entropies . before doing so",
    ", we emphasize that negative values of the casimir entropy are not in conflict with well established thermodynamic principles .",
    "while entropies should be positive , the casimir entropy actually is a difference of entropies and can therefore well be negative @xcite .",
    "however , even the casimir entropy has to tend towards zero in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "this is indeed the case for the drude model for any nonvanishing value of the zero - frequency conductivity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , close inspection reveals that strictly positive casimir entropies over the whole temperature range are rather the exception than the rule . in order to explore the geometric origin of the negative casimir entropy ,",
    "a recent study considered the retarded casimir - polder interaction between a nanoobject and a plane or between two nanoobjects @xcite .",
    "the properties of the nanoobjects were described in terms of their electric and magnetic polarizabilities . by allowing also for anisotropic polarizabilities , a variety of scenarios",
    "could be generated , thus providing insight into the conditions under which negative casimir entropies can occur .    here ,",
    "we start from a scattering approach for the electromagnetic field and emphasize the contributions of different scattering channels .",
    "first , we observe that the negativity of the casimir entropy becomes most pronounced when the distance between sphere and plane or between the two spheres is large compared to the radius of the spheres .",
    "this observation holds despite the fact that the entropy scales with the third power of the radius for small radii so that its overall value will be strongly suppressed . as a consequence ,",
    "the large - distance limit is appropriate to identify the physical mechanism responsible for the negative casimir entropy . in particular",
    ", this limit permits us to restrict the reflection at the spheres to the dipole modes , @xmath0 .",
    "the large - distance limit considerably simplifies the expression for the casimir free energy within the scattering approach as we shall see in sect .",
    "[ sec : largedistanceapproximation ] .",
    "firstly , the values of the quantum number @xmath1 of the @xmath2-component of the angular momentum , which is conserved for geometries of interest here , are constrained to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "secondly , it is sufficient to account for one single scattering roundtrip between the two objects involved . in total , we are left with three distinct types of channels .",
    "two of these channels leave the polarization type unchanged and are only distinguished by the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the third channel involves a change of polarization and occurs only for @xmath6 .",
    "the most relevant channel for the negative casimir entropy is the last one .",
    "as we shall see , this scattering channel is characterized by a casimir free energy which increases monotonically with temperature .",
    "its contribution to the casimir entropy vanishes at zero temperature as well as in the high - temperature limit , but is negative for any temperatures in between .",
    "this result points towards the importance of polarization mixing in the appearance of a negative casimir entropy .    the scenarios of different geometries and zero - frequency conductivity sketched in the beginning of this section",
    "fit nicely into this picture . in the plane - plane configuration ,",
    "the polarization is conserved at each reflection .",
    "therefore , the negative casimir entropy appearing for drude - type damping in that case can not be of geometric origin . on the other hand , for the sphere - plane and sphere - sphere configurations",
    ", drude - type metals will suppress polarization mixing .",
    "therefore , it is to be expected that at least one of the two scatterers should have a divergent zero - frequency conductivity in order to allow for a negative casimir entropy in the large - distance limit .",
    "in our analysis of the negative casimir entropy , we will concentrate on the sphere - plane configuration and the sphere - sphere configuration depicted in figs .  [",

    "@xcite this was done by choosing objects with anisotropic polarizabilities and by varying their electric and magnetic properties . here , we will do the latter by allowing the objects to be either made of perfectly conducting metals or drude - type metals which have a finite zero - frequency conductivity .",
    "the results will further underline the relevance of the polarization - changing channels .    for simplicity",

    "these properties of the mie coefficients allow us to construct three different scenarios by choosing two spheres both made of perfect conductors , both made of drude metals , or one made of a perfect conductor and the other of a drude metal . in the first case ,",

    "the curve for d / d corresponds to the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ss_entropy_largedist ] . ]",
    "the inset puts a special emphasis on the low - temperature behavior and shows clearly that in all three cases , the casimir entropy takes on positive values for very low temperatures .",
    "however , only when all spheres are made of a drude metal does the casimir entropy remain positive for all temperatures .",
    "this is the case where no polarization - changing channels contribute .",
    "it is sufficient to allow for one polarization - changing channel by making one of the spheres perfectly conducting in order to obtain a temperature window in which the casimir entropy becomes negative .",
    "the effect becomes even more pronounced if both spheres are perfectly conducting as the weight of the polarization - changing channels is doubled while the contribution of the polarization - conserving channels is only increased by a quarter .",
    "the origin of the negative casimir entropy in the plane - sphere and sphere - sphere configuration has been analyzed in the limit where the distance between the objects is much larger than the radius of the sphere(s ) . in this limit , the casimir free energy and the casimir entropy can easily be decomposed into the contributions from various channels describing a roundtrip between the objects .",
    "three kinds of channels have been identified , differing significantly in the temperature dependence of their contribution to the casimir entropy .",
    "the second kind of channels also conserves polarization but involves spherical waves with @xmath76 .",
    "while these channels yield a positive contribution to the casimir entropy at high temperatures , their contribution at sufficiently low temperatures is negative .",
    "however , this negative part is compensated by the polarization - conserving channels with @xmath53 .",
    "the third kind of channels is the most interesting one , because its contribution to the casimir entropy is negative for all temperatures .",
    "this behavior is associated with polarization - changing channels which exist for @xmath76 but not for @xmath53 .",
    "these channels are special , because their casimir free energy vanishes in the high - temperature limit .",
    "this fact and the ensuing negative contribution to the casimir entropy has been traced back to the polarization - changing nature of the channels .",
    "it can thus be concluded that polarization mixing in a scattering process is a crucial ingredient for the appearance of a negative casimir entropy , at least in the plane - sphere and sphere - sphere configuration .",
    "which of the various channels contribute to the casimir entropy can be influenced by appropriately choosing the material out of which the scattering objects are made .",
    "one can use the fact that in the long - distance limit the reflection of transverse electric modes at spheres made of a drude metal becomes negligible .",
    "we have shown that for two drude metal spheres , the casimir entropy is positive for all temperatures .",
    "in this situation , only roundtrip scattering processes involving transverse magnetic modes are relevant .",
