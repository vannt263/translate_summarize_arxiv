    "<S> several angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies reveal a poorly nested fermi surface of lifeas , far away from a spin density wave instability , and clear - cut superconducting gap anisotropies . on the other hand a very different </S>",
    "<S> , more nested fermi surface and dissimilar gap anisotropies have been obtained from quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) data , which were interpreted as arising from _ intraband _ scattering within hole - like bands . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that this arpes - qpi paradox is completely resolved by _ interband _ scattering between the hole - like bands . </S>",
    "<S> the resolution follows from an excellent agreement between experimental quasiparticle scattering data and @xmath0-matrix qpi calculations ( based on experimental band structure data ) , which allows disentangling interband and intraband scattering processes .    </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of the iron - based superconductor lifeas became recently a matter of strong controversial interest @xcite since its precise knowledge is crucial for an understanding of the unusual superconductivity of lifeas . </S>",
    "<S> iron - arsenides have the well - known property that experimentally observed factors such as fermi surface ( fs ) nesting and van - hove singularity - like behavior have a decisive impact on the type of spin fluctuations and on the superconducting ground state : a poorly nested model band structure of lifeas which mimics essential findings from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments yields prevailing ferromagnetic fluctuations with an instability towards triplet superconductivity @xcite , whereas a calculated electronic band structure with a stronger nesting has been shown to result in an @xmath1-wave superconducting ground state driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite .    several arpes studies on lifeas indeed consistently reveal a quite poor nesting , an ( almost ) van hove singularity for one hole - like band at the fermi level , and clear - cut momentum dependencies of the superconducting gap @xmath2 for each band @xmath3 @xcite . a much different normal state band structure which corresponds to a stronger nesting and other superconducting gap anisotropies @xmath2 have , however , recently been deduced from a spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy ( si - stm ) study of the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) of lifeas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is based on the central assumption that quasiparticles inducing the qpi are scattered only internally within separate hole - like bands .    in this letter , we show that this seeming arpes - qpi paradox is completely resolved when _ interband _ scattering is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> to be specific , we compare the experimentally observed qpi pattern at small wave vectors @xmath4 with qpi calculations which _ i ) _ are based on experimental band structure data and _ ii ) _ allow to consider individual scattering processes separately . </S>",
    "<S> we find an excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated data when the mentioned interband scattering is taken into account , whereas _ intraband _ scattering alone ( the essential hypothesis in ref .  ) </S>",
    "<S> fails to yield such an agreement . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the observed qpi s of ref .   and that of another qpi study of lifeas </S>",
    "<S> @xcite without having to resort to low - energy band structure models that are contradicting arpes experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> lifeas is a _ </S>",
    "<S> stoichiometric _ superconductor , i.e. superconductivity emerges already without doping , at a relatively high critical temperature @xmath5  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> already this renders it radically different from the canonical 1111 and 122 iron - arsenide superconductors , where strong nesting between hole - like and electron - like fs pockets causes an antiferromagnetic spin density wave ( sdw ) ground state in the undoped parent compounds . </S>",
    "<S> there , superconductivity emerges only if the sdw state is weakened e.g. by doping @xcite , and nesting - related antiferromagnetic fluctuations have been suggested to drive the superconductivity with an @xmath1-wave order parameter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lifeas , however , appears to be far away from an sdw instability : all doping attempts lead to a decrease of @xmath6 @xcite , and according to the arpes studies @xcite , the fs of lifeas consists of two similarly sized electron - like fs sheets around the @xmath7-point , and two hole - like fs sheets around the @xmath8-point arising from hole - like bands ( labelled @xmath9 and @xmath10 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fs_schem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the two bands has a relatively large fs ( @xmath10-band , @xmath11 ) , whereas the other is very small ( @xmath12 ) such that the corresponding @xmath9-band just touches the fermi level yielding a structure close to a van - hove singularity . </S>",
    "<S> due to the lack of surface states @xcite these findings and those from si - stm are expected to be bulk representative , and in fact the arpes electronic structure has been shown to be well consistent with bulk sensitive hall effect results @xcite .    in their qpi study @xcite , allan et al . used the extracted scattering vectors of the qpi to construct three hole - band dispersions along high - symmetry directions , where they assumed the observed scattering vectors to stem from intraband scattering . </S>",
    "<S> one of the resulting bands ( labeled @xmath13 in ref .  ) is consistent with the @xmath10-band observed in arpes @xcite , and another ( @xmath14 ) matches quite well the @xmath9-band ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fs_schem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the third of the suggested bands ( @xmath15 ) lacks such a correspondence since its fermi wave vector @xmath16 @xcite neither matches that of the large nor the small hole - like fs observed in arpes ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fs_schem ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> its length is , however much closer to that of the electron - like bands and thus is the one which would result in a stronger nesting .     and @xmath13 as obtained from qpi by allan et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that allan et al . </S>",
    "<S> extract the fermi wave vectors along high - symmetry directions and that the shown fs sheets are respective isotropic two - dimensional extrapolations . </S>",
    "<S> the shown unfolded brillouin zone ( bz ) refers to the one - fe unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> the bz related to the two - fe unit cell is indicated by dotted lines . </S>",
    "<S> b ) lifeas band structure at negative energies . </S>",
    "<S> circles represent the extracted quasiparticle dispersions @xmath17 of the hole - like bands @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 obtained in ref .  , where @xmath18 is given by half of the length of the observed scattering vectors @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> grey shaded contours represent @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands as observed by arpes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extended width of the @xmath9 band indicates @xmath20 dependence obtained from different photon energies @xcite . the indicated dispersion shown as a dashed line corresponds to data obtained at a photon energy @xmath21  ev . ]    as is evident in refs .   and , </S>",
    "<S> a prominent feature of the fourier transformed experimental qpi pattern at negative bias is a bright squarish contour at small @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp_schem](a ) shows our si - stm data at @xmath23  mev , which we have obtained on high - quality superconducting lifeas single crystals @xcite in a home - built scanning tunneling microscope at @xmath24  k ( see ref .   for details of the measurement and the full topographic and spectroscopic data set ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chosen energy value is significantly larger ( @xmath25  mev ) than the superconducting gap value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus gap anisotropies do not play a strong role in the qpi pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the observed square structure can be straightforwardly understood by considering backscattering between the small ( @xmath9 ) and the large ( @xmath10 ) hole band @xcite : due to the high dos of the @xmath9-band and the relatively small momentum spread of this band at a given energy close to the band - top ( see fig .  [ fs_schem](b ) ) , the corresponding scattering vectors ( labeled @xmath26 ) just map the constant energy contour ( cec ) of the @xmath10-band ( cf . fig .  [ exp_schem](b ) ) . in order to underpin this statement </S>",
    "<S> , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fs_schem](b ) that the diagonal @xmath27 with @xmath28 @xcite with a length @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 the shortest fe - fe distance , and @xmath31 the in - plane lattice constant @xcite ) just connects states in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands along the @xmath32 direction as observed at this energy by arpes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ref .   reports a similar squarish structure , the size of which along the @xmath32 direction allan et al . used to extract the @xmath15-dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find that the diagonal @xmath26 perfectly matches the reported @xmath33 at @xmath34 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shows unambiguously that _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ the present and the reported qpi patterns of allan et al . are geometrically well consistent , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ii ) _ as a consequence , the suggested @xmath15-band by allan et al . does not describe a quasiparticle dispersion but has to be reinterpreted as the dispersion of the scattering wave vectors @xmath26 which connect the @xmath9 and @xmath10 hole - like bands .    </S>",

    "<S> b ) simplified constant energy contours ( cec ) of the hole - like @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands at @xmath23  mev . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 represents interband scattering processes which connect states on both bands . </S>",
    "<S> it has the same length as @xmath35 ( i.e. , the diameter of the dashed @xmath15-cec ) reported in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 represents intraband scattering within the @xmath10 band . </S>",
    "<S> [ exp_schem ] ]    having established this most important finding we corroborate it further by qpi simulations which we use to analyze the influence of the individual possible scattering processes separately . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the qpi intensity distribution arising from the local density of states ( ldos ) is based on a standard @xmath0-matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> thereby the underlying electronic band structure of lifeas is modeled by a tight - binding approximation of the arpes results of refs .   and . </S>",
    "<S> from the latter work we have derived an appropriate model for the superconducting gap function @xmath37 which is able to model the measured momentum dependence of the superconducting gap along the fermi surface of the hole pockets @xmath9 and @xmath10 of fig .  [ fs_schem](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes anisotropic @xmath38-wave pairing where the gap value along @xmath10 varies between @xmath39  mev and @xmath40  mev being minimal at the direction towards the electron - like fs . </S>",
    "<S> the gap along @xmath9 is almost isotropic with a value of approximately @xmath41  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> -matrix approach applied to a tight - binding model of the arpes results @xcite and anisotropic @xmath38-wave pairing ( see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> a ) only intraband scattering within the small hole - like band @xmath9 and the large hole - like band @xmath10 is considered . </S>",
    "<S> all scattering processes between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and those processes involving the electron bands are suppressed in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> b ) only interband scattering between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is considered . </S>",
    "<S> c ) contributions displayed in panels a ) and b ) are summed up in order to enable the comparison of the intensities . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering vectors @xmath26 , @xmath36 ( see fig .  [ exp_schem ] ) are indicated . ]    for the numerical evaluation we use a square lattice of @xmath42 lattice points and periodic boundary conditions . to simplify the treatment </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the isotropic scattering potential acts locally without coupling to the spin of conduction electrons ( potential scattering ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cleanliness of the sample used for the stm measurements @xcite allows us to neglect multiple scattering processes ( born approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ theo ] shows calculated qpi patterns for bias voltage @xmath23  mev . in order to identify the origin of the different features in the measured intensity distribution displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp_schem](a ) we faded out specific scattering processes such that only intraband scattering within the two hole pockets @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( panel ( a ) ) and only interband scattering between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( panel ( b ) ) entered the calculation separately . in panel ( c ) the intensities of both scattering types are summed up . as it is found already from geometrical interpretation of the experimental result </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulation confirms that the bright squarish structure described by vector @xmath26 has to be assigned clearly to interband scattering . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , its intensity is significantly larger than the intraband contributions which are seen as _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ a small region around the @xmath8 point indicating scattering within the small hole pocket @xmath9 and _ ii ) _ a large contour indicated by scattering vectors @xmath36 connecting momenta within the large hole fs . the comparison between fig .  [ theo](c ) and </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp_schem](a ) shows that the size and shape of most of the qpi features can be reproduced by our numerical simulation in excellent agreement with the experimental results .    beyond the bright structures we find also several features showing minor intensity . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the intraband scattering within @xmath10 shows a pronounced maximum at momenta @xmath43 along the lines connecting the points @xmath44 and @xmath45 which is seen very well in the experimental result ( @xmath36 ) . on the other hand structures within the bright @xmath26-contour </S>",
    "<S> appear with less intensity as they show up in the experimental result fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp_schem](a ) . this difference might be traced back to the influence of coherence factors entering the numerical simulation . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that a possible variation of the superconducting phase along the fermi surface strongly affects the intensity distribution of the qpi at bias energy close to the superconducting gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that within our simple anisotropic @xmath38-wave order parameter model though the gap value is consistent with arpes studies a possible variation of the phase is neglected completely . </S>",
    "<S> such phase effects are interesting and will be subject to a forthcoming publication .    to sum up </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the quasiparticle interference in lifeas is dominated by interband scattering between two different hole - like bands around the @xmath8 point . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation of the experimental results is supported by a comparison to a numerical simulation of the qpi based on a realistic tight - binding model that has been carefully extracted from recent arpes data . within this theoretical analysis we considered the different scattering processes separately and we obtained an excellent agreement with the experimental qpi data from refs .   and . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a consistency between the results of the two experimental stm approaches and arpes is obtained when going beyond considering only intraband scattering and include interband scattering explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> this changes fundamentally the interpretation of the extracted @xmath15-band and the proposed gap anisotropy @xmath46 of ref .  , and explains in both cases their strong discrepancy with arpes data . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath14 and @xmath13 bands the consistency with the arpes results and also the present qpi calculations is apparently very good . </S>",
    "<S> this is compelling evidence that the band structure suggested by apres is indeed correct . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note , that this band structure is also well compatible with a recent de haas van alphen study @xcite , where significant fs nesting in lifeas is claimed , despite only electron - like orbits in agreement with arpes have been observed by this bulk sensitive technique so far . </S>"
