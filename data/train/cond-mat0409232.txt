    "high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) are known to undergo fundamental changes in some of their properties as the carrier density ( doping , _ p _ ) is changed . at low doping",
    "we have an insulating anti - ferromagnetic phase ( afm ) , possibly a mott - hubbard insulator , which gradually disappears upon increase of doping leaving place to an anomalous metallic phase presenting superconductivity above a certain doping level .",
    "figure 1 presents such a generic phase diagram of htsc for hole doping @xcite .",
    "apart from the intensive research on the superconductive ( sc ) region initiated after the discovery of htsc in 1986 , the surrounding normal phases began to receive special attention during the last decade .",
    "the existence of a pseudogap ( pg ) below the temperature @xmath3 , is today a well established fact in the underdoped regime @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , confirmed by different experimental techniques , like nmr , arpes , specific heat measurements , tunnelling , etc . as reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the strange metal , or marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) phase has been also well characterized experimentally , and given a detailed theoretical explanation @xcite .",
    "however , the canonical fermi liquid ( fl ) phase , as defined in @xcite , supposed to exist below a temperature @xmath6 @xcite in the overdoped region ( @xmath7 ) , still rests on speculative grounds with contradictory experimental data and no clear theoretical understanding .",
    "we want to provide additional experimental data and discussion in order to shed more light on the nature of this region .",
    "our main conclusion is that this phase is not a canonical fl .",

    "phases : anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) , pseudogap ( pg ) , marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) , superconductor ( sc ) , fermi liquid ( fl ) .",
    "the question mark in the fl phase indicates it is not confirmed.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the temperature @xmath8 can be determined from resistivity vs. temperature measurements as the point where the resistivity , @xmath9 , departs ( decreases ) from a linear behavior in underdoped samples @xcite .",
    "the drop of @xmath9 is understood to be a consequence of the opening of a pg in the interaction at the origin of carriers scattering , for instance spin fluctuation @xcite . in a similar way @xmath10",
    "can be obtained from resistivity measurements as the departure from linearity ( increase ) in overdoped samples @xcite .",
    "the existence of a certain anomaly along the line @xmath10 has been theoretically suggested by friedel and kohmoto@xcite , and a new phase below the same line was demonstrated by arpes measurements @xcite .",
    "the upturn in @xmath9 vs. _ t _ has been fitted to @xmath11 @xcite , which would imply the emergence of fl behavior assuming a dominant fermion - fermion scattering @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion is not quite clear since the upturn occurs at temperatures much higher than in usual metals .",
    "furthermore , deviations from the above quadratic law have been observed , which contradict the fl assumption .",
    "for instance , proust et al .",
    "@xcite have reported a behavior @xmath12 for tl-2201 with a substantial linear term ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "naqib et al .",
    "@xcite reported also a dependence @xmath14 for their measured samples @xmath15 , as well as in samples measured by other authors : @xmath16 ( lsco ) @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 ( ybco-123 ) @xcite , and @xmath19 ( tbco-221 ) @xcite . in all cases",
    "_ m _ ranges from @xmath20 at @xmath21 to @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "a fractional power law would be a clear indication of non fl behavior and has been associated with the hypothesis of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) @xcite , in analogy with the situation in heavy fermions @xcite .",
    "we argue in section v that the increase of @xmath9 over linearity in overdoped samples is not necessarily related to a phase transition or a crossover , but instead may be a consequence of the physical requirement of non negative resistivity at low temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the _ t_-independent canonical fl behavior , measurements of @xmath2 in different htsc materials present a strong _ t_-dependence .",
    "@xmath2 rises as temperature goes down below room temperature , presenting a peak near @xmath24 , before the normal - superconductor transition .",
    "the temperature dependence , excluding the peak itself , can be fitted to the equation @xmath25 @xcite , where the fit parameters depend on doping .",
    "fl theories of the normal state of the cuprates assume that the _ t_-dependence of @xmath26 decreases continuously with doping in all htsc @xcite .",
    "however , an objective observation of published data shows on the one hand , that evolution of @xmath27 with doping presents important differences between different htsc systems ( see discussion in section v ) . on the other hand , none of them fits into the canonical fl picture .",
    "the case of ybco-123 @xcite , systematically presented in this report in section iii.b shows a peculiar non - monotonic behavior .",
    "the hall cotangent @xmath28 presents experimentally a robust _ t_-dependence , almost independent of doping , which can be fitted by @xmath29 @xcite . some deviations from the quadratic _",
    "t_-dependence have been observed , especially for doping different from optimal .",

    "this broad spectrum of results suggests that htsc may not approach continuously a canonical fl as doping increases and that evolution with doping varies from system to system . to our knowledge ,",
    "no conclusive experimental evidence exists of a canonical fl behavior in overdoped samples , except perhaps in tlbacuo , where @xmath37 presents a weak _ t_-dependence and additionally the wiedeman - franz law has been verified @xcite . in order to explore further the anomalous overdoped state we have measured resistivity and hall effect in @xmath1 samples with different ca and o content ( doping ) at temperatures above @xmath38 .",
    "we compare our results to theoretical predictions from two representative fl models and show that they can not give a satisfactory explanation to our data .",
    "a fl phenomenological model based on the assumption of an anisotropic scattering rate along the fs was proposed by carrington et al .",
    "@xcite . a further development lead to the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) of stojkovic and pines @xcite ( hereafter referred to as sp - nafl model ) .",
    "this model is supported by arpes measurements @xcite and band structure calculations @xcite , which show that the fs of hole doped htsc looks like a square with rounded corners centered at the @xmath39 point ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "two regions with different scattering rates are assumed @xcite : hot regions corresponding to the large flat surfaces where magnetic interactions ( spin fluctuation scattering , sfs ) are stronger , with @xmath41 , and cold regions near the corners of the fs , with @xmath42 ; with @xmath43 . for overdoped samples it is assumed that the fs grows with doping and that the scattering anisotropy reduces , therefore weakening the @xmath37 dependence .",
    "but there are not specific quantitative predictions , in this as in most models , for overdoped samples .    a second fl model we have chosen to compare our data to is the one from bok and bouvier @xcite , based on the van - hove singularity ( vhs )",
    ". we will refer to it hereafter as the bb - vhs model . in this model the coexistence of electron - like and hole - like orbits at energies near the fermi energy , when it lies close to the vhs , is emphasized . in the bb - vhs model @xmath2",
    "is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are the density of carriers and @xmath46 their mobility ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 .",
    "they have shown that including second neighbor interactions in their tight - binding calculation the fs possesses certain regions with positive and others with negative curvature .",
    "therefore positive and negative contributions to @xmath2 may produce an apparent variable carrier density . the predicted sign change in @xmath2 would be shifted to the overdoped side due to this correction .",
    "high quality c - axis oriented thin films of @xmath1 , with different _ x _ and @xmath49 were prepared by dc off - axis sputtering by a method described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "deposition time was one and half hours , producing films with an average thickness @xmath50 and an uncertainty of @xmath51 .",
    "they were deposited on square @xmath52 ( 100 ) substrates of size 5x5 @xmath53 or 10x10 @xmath53 .",
    "the doping level was adjusted by changing the ca content _ x _ , and/or the o content by annealing .",
    "four indium contacts were fixed to the corners for electrical measurements .",
    "the main source of uncertainties in our measurements come from the estimation of films thickness from the deposition time ( according to previously calibrated films ) .",
    "this uncertainty dominates over other possible error sources , like surface roughness ( typically few percents ) .      in order to preserve the square geometry of our samples ( needed for later measurements of penetration length with a microwave resonator ) we used the van - der pauw method .",
    "a current _ i _ is sent through one diagonal and voltage is measured along the second diagonal , then we exchange the connections for _ i _ with those for _ v _ and measure again .",
    "this method also requires the inversion of current sense and magnetic field direction in order to compute the average .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the film s surface , i. e. along the c - axis , and scanned from -1 to + 1 tesla .",
    "a linear fit to the data at different fields gives the slope @xmath54 , where @xmath30 is the magnetic induction , at every temperature point .",
    "the hall density of carriers is then computed as @xmath55(dv_{h}/db)^{-1}$ ] , , where @xmath2 is measured at room temperature .",
    "we must remember that this number gives the density of carriers only for a parabolic band structure @xcite .",
    "from @xmath56 we could try to estimate _",

    "an alternative method for computing _",
    "p _ by comparing data for @xmath57 with the universal parabola @xmath58 is not straightforward because the relationship between @xmath56 and _ p _ ( or oxygen content _ x _ ) is not linear .",
    "a more reliable way of computing _ p _ is by means of the universal curve for thermopower @xcite , but such measurements were not made here , therefore we keep @xmath56 as a representative parameter , which anyway does not affect our conclusions .",

    "where _ e _ is the electronic charge and @xmath61 is the hall voltage . in the following the room temperature value of @xmath56 will be used as an indicator of the doping level .",
    "we used the lock - in amplifier technique with an ac current of 10 ma ( rms ) at a frequency of 1 hz .",
    "resistivity is measured by sending the current _ i _ through the contacts on one side of the sample and measuring voltage along the opposite side .",

    "evolution of normal transport properties with doping in ybco-123 is not monotonic , contrary to what is usually believed .",
    "furthermore , this material , as well as other htsc systems , does not present a clear trend towards a canonical fl at high doping .",
    "this appears to be the rule , except probably in tbco-221 . for ybco-123",
    "in particular we find a minimum in the _ t_-dependence of @xmath2 at @xmath59 .",
    "our measurements of the hall effect show that @xmath37 approaches a constant value , @xmath146 , for any doping level at temperatures above the line @xmath147 .",
    "additionally , we find no range of temperature and doping where both @xmath9 and @xmath148 have simultaneously the canonical fl behavior . at optimal doping @xmath2",
    "becomes rapidly _",
    "t_-independent at @xmath149 , but @xmath76 is linear ( mfl ) . in the overdoped region , at low temperatures , @xmath37 has an anomalous behavior while @xmath76 might be though of as having the canonical fl behavior , @xmath150 ( afl ) .",
    "these results contradict the assumption of a canonical fl region in the overdoped region as shown in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "they can not be explained by the smooth reduction of the relaxation rate anisotropy with doping predicted by the nafl model of stojkovic and pines @xcite , nor by the vhs - based model of bock and bouvier @xcite .",
    "in fact , these models , as well as others , do not address directly the problem of the overdoped regime but rather assume that it is a canonical fl .",
    "a correct model of the normal state of the htsc should take into account the anomalous _ t_-dependence behavior of @xmath151 and @xmath152 in the overdoped region .",
    "we encourage theoreticians to undertake the challenge of discussing these points and to extend their models to the overdoped region , which up to now has been almost neglected .",
    "this work has been supported by the heinrich hertz center for high temperature superconductivity and by the oren family chair of experimental solid state physics .",

    "<S> according to a generic temperature vs. carrier - doping ( @xmath0 ) phase diagram of high - temperature superconductors it has been proposed that as doping increases to the overdoped region they approach gradually a conventional ( canonical ) fermi liquid . however , hall effect measurements in several systems reported by different authors show a still strong _ t_-dependence in overdoped samples . </S>",
    "<S> we report here electrical transport measurements of @xmath1 thin films presenting a temperature dependence of the hall constant , @xmath2 , which does not present a gradual transition towards the _ t_-independent behavior of a canonical fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the _ t_-dependence passes by a minimum near optimal doping and then increases again in the overdoped region . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the theoretical predictions from two representative fermi liquid models and show that they can not give a satisfactory explanation to our data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that this region of the phase diagram in ybco , as in most htsc , is not a canonical fermi liquid , therefore we call it anomalous fermi liquid . </S>"
