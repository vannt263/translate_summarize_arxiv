    "<S> we also obtain its guessing probability and optimal measurement .    </S>",

    "<S> the goal of the minimum error state discrimination is to obtain the maximum of @xmath12 , called _ the guessing probability _ @xmath13 , using povm . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the minimum error state discrimination can be described as @xmath14 by semidefinite programming@xcite , the dual problem of eq.([eq : convex ] ) is obtained as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17 hermitian matrix . in fact , using a non - negative number @xmath18 and the density matrix @xmath19 , the constraints of the dual problem can be written as @xmath20 since the above operator @xmath16 is equal for all @xmath21 , the following relation holds @xmath22 in the optimization problem , the dual problem in general has _ </S>",

    "<S> the complementarity problem is the one where a solution is found for the optimization problem by using the optimality conditions which should satisfy the parameters of the primal and dual problem . in this article @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> is used to denote the optimality of the parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> henceforth , by confining only the case of the two - level system ( @xmath33 ) let us obtain the geometric condition for eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : kktc ] ) . from the bloch representation @xmath34 and @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> we can derive the following relations : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the bloch vectors and @xmath39 represents the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> since we assume @xmath40 , we can find @xmath41 from eq . </S>",

    "<S> therefore if @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 @xmath44 . here , let us take an inductive approach to @xmath0-qubit - state discrimination , which means that by assuming that the way to discriminate ( @xmath45 ) states may be known , we investigate a method to discriminate among the @xmath0-qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is sufficient to consider only those cases where every optimal povm element is nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> ( for generality , we will later consider cases where some of the optimal povm elements may be zero . ) </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider cases where every optimal povm element is nonzero and the guessing probability is greater than @xmath46 . in this case , since @xmath47 is nonzero , the condition ( iii ) becomes @xmath48 , which implies that the rank of @xmath19 and @xmath49 should be one . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for each @xmath21 , we find @xmath50 and @xmath51 since @xmath52 is povm , @xmath53 should satisfy @xmath54 therefore , @xmath55 is necessary to satisfy the following conditions ( which we will call the geometric kkt conditions ) : @xmath56 next , we will show that even when every optimal povm element is nonzero and the guessing probability becomes @xmath46 , @xmath57 is necessary to satisfy the above condition eq . </S>",

    "<S> we will prove this by considering both cases @xmath58 and @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of @xmath58 implies @xmath60 by the kkt condition ( ii ) , which turns out to be the case of discriminating among the same quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> however , we may exclude this case since we are interested in discriminating entirely different quantum states . in the case of @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that since @xmath61 , @xmath62 satisfies the geometric kkt conditions ( i ) , ( iii ) , and ( iv ) . if @xmath63 , the geometric conditions ( i ) and ( iv ) do not put any restriction on @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath67 , the following relation holds : @xmath68 then by @xmath9 given in eq.([eq : optm ] ) , we can see that @xmath69 of the primal problem is equal to @xmath26 : @xmath70 therefore @xmath71 become the optimal parameters of our primal and dual problems . since every @xmath72 is positive we can see that all the povm elements are nonzero . from this </S>",
    "<S> , the following lemma [ lem : gk ] can be obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lem : gk ] the fact that every optimal povm element can be nonzero is equivalent to the fact that @xmath55 satisfying the geometric kkt conditions exists .    </S>",
    "<S> let us denote @xmath73 as the polytope formed by @xmath74 . when the number of extreme points of @xmath75 is the same as the number of quantum states to be discriminated , the geometric meaning of eq.([eq : nonzerogeo ] ) can be easily expressed . </S>",
    "<S> then the geometric condition ( i ) indicates that @xmath76 is congruent to @xmath77 . the geometric condition ( ii ) </S>",
    "<S> implies that the origin of the bloch sphere lies in the relative interior of @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the geometric condition ( iii ) ensures that the distances from the origin to the extreme points of @xmath78 become @xmath79 . the final condition ( iv ) </S>",
    "<S> shows that the difference between the distances should be the same as that between the _ a priori _ probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath55 satisfying the geometric kkt conditions ( i)(iii ) certainly exists , the crucial element for obtaining the guessing probability is condition ( iv ) .    let us explain how to discover the guessing probability when @xmath55 can not satisfy the geometric kkt conditions . in this case </S>",
    "<S> at least one of the optimal povm elements is zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if we denote @xmath80 the guessing probability function for @xmath0-qubit states , we may write it as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the proper subset of @xmath83 . for now , using @xmath82 and lemma [ lem : gk ] </S>",
    "<S> , we will obtain the guessing probability and the optimal measurement when @xmath76 becomes a special case . </S>",
    "<S> first , let us consider when @xmath76 becomes a point . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , suppose that @xmath55 satisfies the geometric kkt conditions . </S>",
    "<S> then the conditions ( i ) and ( iii ) imply the equality of @xmath84 . applying this result to condition ( ii ) , we find that @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which contradicts each other </S>",
    "<S> . therefore we can see that when @xmath76 forms a point , every optimal povm element can not be nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> since for any proper subset @xmath82 of @xmath87 , @xmath88 becomes a point , the nonzero element of the optimal povm is only one . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find corollary [ coro : ep1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> [ coro : ep1 ] if the number of the extreme points to @xmath89 is one , every optimal povm element except @xmath90 is zero , and the guessing probability is @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the second case is when @xmath76 forms a line segment . </S>",
    "<S> let us denote the two indices corresponding to the extreme points as @xmath91 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> then the geometric kkt condition ( i ) indicates that @xmath93 should be a line segment with the same length to @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> condition ( ii ) requires that @xmath93 contain the origin @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the length of the line segment becomes @xmath96 the equality in the second line comes from the condition ( iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , by applying condition ( iv ) to eq.([eq : tsk3 ] ) we have @xmath97 since @xmath98 should be non - negative , we find @xmath99 . </S>",
