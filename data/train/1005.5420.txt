    "when the hopping parameters are sufficiently large a new phase , in which there is a strong correlation of the two doublet fields and the global symmetry is spontaneously broken , emerges .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking was verified by calculation of the order parameter for some specific choices of the model parameters .",
    "this was done by the usual procedure of introducing an explicit symmetry - breaking term and studying the behavior of the system as the volume of the simulation was increased and the symmetry - breaking term was removed .",
    "the presence of goldstone bosons in the broken phase was verified by calculation of the correlation functions of appropriate gauge - invariant interpolating operators .",
    "in addition to goldstone bosons we also find scalar states which remain massive in all phases . as in the one - doublet model",
    "the gauge symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the focus of this work was spontaneous global symmetry breaking so the question of the spectrum of vector bosons was not addressed . in the nonperturbative lattice",
    "approach the vector bosons are composite particles and are expected to be massive in all regions of the phase diagram .",
    "this can be confirmed by a cursory examination of the correlation functions of the vector operators .",
    "however , the quantitative determination of the mass is a difficult problem due to the plethora of operators that can be constructed which would require careful study of operator mixing and also decays due to the presence of light ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons in the theory .",
    "such a study might give some information about the nature of the theory in different regions of the parameter space .",
    "work on the three - dimensional higgs model @xcite gives some insight into the difficulty and benefit of a spectrum calculation ."
