    "after the discovery of ferromagnetism in ( ga , mn)as , diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) have received considerable attention owing to potential applications based on the use of both their charge and spin degrees of freedom in electronic devices @xcite .",
    "thus far , the highest curie temperature of ( ga , mn)as has been t@xmath1 = 190 k @xcite .",
    "the substitution of divalent mn atoms into trivalent ga sites introduces hole carriers ; thus , ( ga , mn)as is a p - type dms .",
    "the valence mismatch between mn and ga leads to severely limited chemical solubility for mn in gaas . moreover , owing to simultaneous doping of charge and spin induced by mn substitution , it is difficult to individually optimize charge and spin densities .    to overcome these difficulties , a new type of dms , i.e. , li(zn , mn)as was proposed @xcite and later fabricated with t@xmath1 = 50 k @xcite . it is based on liznas , a i@xmath2ii@xmath2v semiconductor .",
    "spin is introduced by isovalent ( zn@xmath3 , mn@xmath3 ) substitution , which is decoupled from carrier doping with excess / deficient li concentration .",
    "although li(zn , mn)as was proposed as a promising n - type dms with excess li@xmath4 , p - type carriers were obtained in the experiment with excess li .",
    "the introduction of holes was presumably because of the excess li@xmath4 in substitutional zn@xmath3 sites @xcite .",
    "later , another i@xmath2ii@xmath2v dms , i.e. , li(zn , mn)p was reported in an experiment with t@xmath1 = 34 k @xcite .",
    "li(zn , mn)p with excess li was determined to be of the p - type as well in the experiment . according to first - principles calculations ,",
    "the reason for this is the same as that for li(zn , mn)as @xcite .",
    "although such p - type i@xmath2ii@xmath2v dmss have a few distinct advantages over ( ga , mn)as , the achievable t@xmath1 is much lower than that of ( ga , mn)as .",
    "another type of dms ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath0as@xmath0 was observed in experiments with t@xmath1 up to 230 k @xcite , which is higher than that for ( ga , mn)as . based on the semiconductor bazn@xmath0as@xmath0 , holes were doped by ( ba@xmath3 , k@xmath4 ) substitutions , and spins by isovalent ( zn@xmath3 , mn@xmath3 ) substitutions . it was a p - type dms .",
    "motivated by the high t@xmath1 , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations @xcite and photoemission spectroscopy experiments @xcite were conducted to understand the microscopic mechanism of ferromagnetism of p - type dms ( ba , k)(zn , mn)@xmath0as@xmath0 . by contrast ,",
    "an n - type dms , i.e. , ba(zn , mn , co)@xmath0as@xmath0 was recently reported in an experiment with t@xmath1 @xmath5 80 k @xcite . in this material , electrons are doped because of the substitution of zn with co , and spins are generated mainly because of ( zn@xmath3 , mn@xmath3 ) substitutions .    in mn - doped bazn@xmath0as@xmath0 , why is the ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling observed in both p- and n - type cases ?",
    "why is t@xmath1 much lower in the n - type case than that in the p - type case ? in general , can p- and n - type dmss be realized ?",
    "the answers will be helpful for fabricating spin p - n junctions in the future .",
    "in this study , we attempt to address such issues . in previous studies on dms materials with wide band gap @xmath6",
    ", we found that the position of the impurity bound state ( ibs ) @xmath7 was close to the top of the valence band ( vb ) owing to the strong mixing between the impurity and the vb , and usually no ibs appeared below the bottom of the conduction band ( cb ) because of weak mixing between the impurity and the cb @xcite .",

    "the magnetic correlation @xmath10 between two impurities with fm coupling ( positive @xmath10 ) can be determined when the chemical potential @xmath11 is tuned to be close to the ibs : @xmath11 @xmath5 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for p - type carriers ( @xmath11 @xmath5 0 ) , fm coupling can be obtained as @xmath11 @xmath5 @xmath7 , and for n - type carriers",

    "<S> we propose a method to realize diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) with p- and n - type carriers by choosing host semiconductors with a narrow band gap . by employing a combination of the density function theory and quantum monte carlo simulation , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate such semiconductors using mn - doped bazn@xmath0as@xmath0 , which has a band gap of 0.2 ev . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we found a nontoxic dms mn - doped bazn@xmath0sb@xmath0 , of which the curie temperature t@xmath1 is predicted to be higher than that of mn - doped bazn@xmath0as@xmath0 , the t@xmath1 of which was up to 230 k in a recent experiment . </S>"
