    "in the framework of the standard model the gauge bosons , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 couple to mixtures of the physical @xmath6 and @xmath7 states .",
    "this mixing is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix : @xmath8 a commonly used approximate parameterization was originally proposed by wolfenstein @xcite .",
    "it reflects the hierarchy between the magnitude of matrix elements belonging to different diagonals .",
    "it is defined as : @xmath9    the standard model parameterization of the quark mixing via the ckm matrix element accomodates a complex phase , and therefore offers a natural way to model the intriguing phenomenon of @xmath10 violation .",
    "so far this violation has been measured only in neutral @xmath11 decays .    the ckm matrix must be unitary and the relation between elements of different rows dictated by this property can be graphically represented as so called ` unitarity triangles ' .",
    "[ ckm_tri ] shows one of the triangles where all the angles are expected to be large : the angles @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath4 are all related to the single phase in the @xmath14 matrix element .",
    "the study of @xmath0 decays will eventually allow the measurements of all the three angles .",
    "additional constraints on the sides will be available too , through more precise measurements of @xmath15 and the determination of the @xmath16 mixing parameter @xmath17 .    in parallel , the study of rare decays can provide a window beyond the standard model , through a detailed comparison of measured and expected branching fractions .",
    "this study needs a refined understanding of strong interaction effects , but may provide powerful constraints on a wide spectrum of models that try to address some of the shortcomings of the standard model .",
    "rare @xmath7 decays encompass several different final states . in general",
    "their common feature is that their dominant decay diagram is based on a suppressed mechanism , either because it is a higher order term in a series expansion ( e.g. loops in the so called ` penguin ' diagrams ) or because the quark coupling at the decay vertex is ckm suppressed .",
    "there are several reasons why a precise experimental mapping of the phenomenology of rare @xmath7 decays is very important .",
    "first of all the decay amplitude suppression makes it possible for these standard model processes to interfere with decay diagrams mediated by exotic mechanisms due to ` beyond standard model ' interactions .",
    "in addition , loop diagrams and ckm suppression can affect our ability of measuring cp violation phases in two different ways .",
    "on one hand , loops and ckm suppressed diagrams can lead to final states accessible to both @xmath0 and @xmath18 decays , making it possible to measure interference effects even without neutral @xmath0 mixing . on the other hand",
    ", the interplay between these two processes can cloud the relationship between measured @xmath10 asymmetries and the ckm phase when mixing induced cp violation is looked for .",
    "a classical example of this effect is the decay @xmath19 .",
    "the two standard model diagrams contributing to this decay process are shown in fig .",
    "[ p - poll ] .",
    "if the @xmath20 diagram is dominant , the angle @xmath12 can be extracted from the measurement of the asymmetry in the decay @xmath21 . on the other hand , if these two diagrams have comparable amplitude , the extraction of @xmath12 from this decay channel is going to be a much more difficult task .",
    "cleo has studied several decays that can lead to a more precise understanding of the interplay between penguin diagrams and @xmath20 diagrams in @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "the analysis technique used has been extensively refined in order to make the best use of the limited statistics presently available . in most of the decay channels of interest ,",
    "the dominant source of background are continuum events ; the fundamental difference between @xmath22 and @xmath0 decays is the shape of the underlying event .",
    "the latter decays tend to produce a more ` spherical ' distribution of particles whereas continuum events tend to be more ` jet - like ' , with most of the particle emitted into two narrow back to back ` jets ' .",
    "this property can be translated into several different shape variables .",
    "cleo constructs a fisher discriminant @xmath23 , a linear combination of several variables @xmath24 .",
    "the variables used are @xmath25 , the cosine of the angle between the candidate @xmath0 sphericity axis and the beam axis , the ratio of fox - wolfram moments @xmath26 , and nine variables that measure the scalar sum of the momenta of the tracks and showers from the rest of the event in 9 angular bins , each of 10@xmath27 , around the candidate sphericity axis .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 have been chosen to optimize the separation between signal and background monte carlo samples @xcite .",
    "in addition , several kinematical constraints allow a more precise determination of the final state .",
    "first of all the energy difference @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the reconstructed candidate mass and @xmath31 is the known beam energy ( @xmath32 for signal events ) and the beam constrained mass @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0 decay angle with respect to the beam axis has a @xmath34 angular distribution .",
    "finally , to improve the separation between the final states @xmath35 and @xmath36 the specific energy loss in the drift chamber , @xmath37 is used .    cleo uses a sophisticated unbinned maximum likelihood ( ml ) fit to optimize the precision of the signal yield obtained in the analysis , using @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath37 wherever applicable . in each of these",
    "fits the likelihood of the event is parameterized by the sum of probabilities for all the relevant signal and background hypotheses , with relevant weights determined by maximizing the likelihood function ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the probability of a particular hypothesis is calculated as the product of the probability density functions for each of the input variables determined with high statistics monte carlo samples .",
    "the likelihood function is defined as : @xmath42 where the index @xmath43 runs over the number of events , the index @xmath44 over the hypotheses considered , @xmath45 are the probabilities for different hypotheses obtained from monte carlo simulations of the signal and background channels considered and independent data samples , and @xmath46 are the fractional yields for hypothesis @xmath44 , with the constraint : @xmath47    further details about the likelihood fit can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the fits include all the decay channels having a similar topology .",
    "for example , in the final state including two charged hadrons , the final states considered were @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "[ pipi ] shows contour plots of the ml fits for the signal yields in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 final states .",
    "the other channels included in the likelihood function have @xmath46 fixed to their most probable value extracted from the fit .",
    "it can be seen that there is a well defined signal for the @xmath48 final state , whereas there is less than 3@xmath51 evidence of having seen @xmath52 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath20 diagram is suppressed with respect to the penguin diagram in @xmath0 decays to two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "table [ twops ] summarizes the cleo results for the @xmath53 final states .",
    "unless explicitly stated , the results are based on a data sample of 5.8 million @xmath54 pairs .",
    "there is a consistent pattern of penguin dominance in  decays into two charmless pseudoscalar mesons that makes the prospects of extracting the angle @xmath12 from the study of the cp asymmetry in the @xmath55 mode less favorable than originally expected .",
    "recently a lot of theoretical discussion has been focused on the possibility of extracting the angle @xmath4 from the study of a variety of ratios of the decays just reviewed . originally fleisher and",
    "mannel @xcite proposed to consider the ratio    @xmath56    subsequently neubert and rosner @xcite proposed a different ratio : @xmath57    a careful study of the effects of final state interaction is necessary to evaluate the relationship between these two ratios and @xmath4 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the cleo result for these ratios is :    @xmath58    the last error in @xmath59 is due to the uncertainty in the charged to neutral @xmath0 meson ratio at the  ( @xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "the experimental errors are too big to be able to exclude specific @xmath4 intervals , but fig .",
    "[ f - buras ] shows that a more precise measurement could restrict the allowed @xmath4 regions .",
