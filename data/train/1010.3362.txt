    "thus to sum over @xmath82 for which @xmath101 as required by theorems [ main ] and  [ generalfuchsian ] , we need only sum over all allowable finite words of length @xmath8 in the alphabet @xmath98 .",
    "it follows that in order to apply proposition  [ matfun ] , we need only check whether the transition matrix @xmath99 is irreducible and strictly irreducible and that @xmath57 is , in a precise sense , almost bijective to @xmath1 . our main work is to show that ( subject to some restrictions if @xmath102 ) this is indeed the case , see propositions  [ thm : irred ] , [ thm : strictlyirreducible ] and  [ prop : almostinjective ] .",
    "notice that the statements of theorems  [ main ] and  [ generalfuchsian ] only involve enumerating words in @xmath100 and are independent of the precise geometry of @xmath55 .",
    "thus for example one can replace the regular @xmath92-gon with any hyperbolic octagon whose interior angles sum to @xmath103 and with generators given by the same combinatorial pattern of side pairings .",
    "we elaborate on this observation in section  [ sec : ubiquity ] , where we explain why requiring a generating set which comes from a fundamental domain with even corners is much more general that it appears , leading to the general statement in theorem  [ generalfuchsian ] .",
    "we briefly review the coding as explained in  @xcite , in which it appears in a simpler and more general form than in the original version  @xcite .    by abuse of notation from now on",

    "the condition that @xmath55 have even corners may seem very special .",

    ". moreover the condition depends only on the geometry of @xmath55 and not on the pattern of side pairings , so that for example the symmetrical @xmath92-gon with opposite sides paired would work equally well .",
    "a simple observation going back to koebe shows that the group corresponding to any closed hyperbolic surface has a fundamental domain with even corners . to see this we have only to choose smooth closed geodesics for the sides of @xmath55",
    "this is always possible ; see  @xcite for a picture .",
    "3 .   if @xmath1 has no torsion but contains parabolics then one can always choose a fundamental polygon with all vertices on @xmath137 .",

    "the deformation can be chosen to preserve the combinatorial pattern of sides and side pairings of @xmath55 . since our results only depend on the group and not on the specific hyperbolic structure , it is sufficient to work with the deformed group for which the fundamental domain does have the even corner property .",
