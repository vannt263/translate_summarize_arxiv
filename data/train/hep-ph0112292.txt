    "the measurement of spin observables gives very important information on the structure of the strong interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , the hermes collaboration has found a significant ( @xmath9 20@xmath10 ) double - spin asymmetry in elastic vector meson electroproduction at energy @xmath11 gev @xcite .",
    "this result is quite intriguing since it was not expected within models of the vector meson production processes based on convenient mesonic and pomeron exchanges .",
    "there are two different approaches to describe the electromagnetic production of light vector mesons at intermediate energies @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first assumes that only @xmath12 and @xmath13 exchanges are relevant for explaining the @xmath0 and @xmath14 cross sections and their relation .",
    "the second involves the pomeron , and the @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath15secondary reggeon exchanges . in both of the approaches the main contribution to the @xmath0 production cross section comes from the natural parity exchanges , e.g. pomeron , @xmath16 and @xmath1 .    in spite of the fact that the @xmath17 coupling constant is very large , the contribution of unnatural parity @xmath12meson exchange to the elastic cross - section is small and falls off rapidly with energy . at hermes energies its value is negligible in both models .    for spin observables the parity of the exchanges plays a crucial role .",
    "for example , the double - spin asymmetry will not vanish only if there is a considerable interference between the exchanges with natural and unnatural parities .",
    "it turns out , that the hermes data are impossible to describe by interference of the pion exchange with any existing natural parity exchanges .",
    "recently we suggested a new unnatural parity anomalous @xmath2 trajectory , with a very high intercept @xmath18 and a small slope @xmath19 , to explain the behavior of the elastic proton - proton , proton - antiproton and vector meson photoproduction cross - sections at large energies and momentum transfers @xcite .",
    "the connection of this new trajectory with spin physics has been stressed , and its importance for the low @xmath20 behavior of the nucleon spin - dependent structure function @xmath21 and the double spin asymmetries in diffractive reactions at large energies has been shown @xcite .",
    "in here we analyze the contributions of the @xmath2 exchange to the double - spin asymmetries in @xmath0-meson electromagnetic production at intermediate energies . and @xmath22-meson production is straightforward . ]",
    "the kinematics of the @xmath0-meson electromagnetic production off the nucleon is shown in fig.[diag ] .",
    "the invariant variables of the reaction are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momenta of the initial photon and proton , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the momenta of the final @xmath0-meson and proton . at hermes",
    "energies the mechanism for vector meson production is rather complicated .",
    "we will take into account the contributions to the amplitude related to the @xmath29 channel pomeron and the anomalous @xmath30 exchanges @xcite , with a weak energy dependence , together with the secondary regge @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath15 exchanges , which have a rather strong energy dependence - pole exchange related to axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "its contribution is important at rather large @xmath31 .",
    "hermes only measures elastic vector meson production cross section at low @xmath32 . ] .    for the pomeron exchange",
    "we use the donnachie - landshoff model @xcite .",
    "the pomeron exchange amplitude is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the @xmath0 meson and @xmath35 is its leptonic width .",
    "the quark - pomeron coupling @xmath36 can be fixed from fits @xcite to total hadron - hadron cross sections . for the mass scale @xmath37 = 4 gev@xmath8",
    "one obtains @xmath36 = 2.0 gev@xmath38 .",
    "the pomeron trajectory is given by @xcite @xmath39 the form factor of the pomeron - nn vertex is @xcite @xmath40 it is also necessary to include an additional factor which takes into account the nonlocality of the pomeron vertex @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 = 1.1 gev@xmath8 .",
    "this formula was obtained under the assumption that the effective quark - quark scattering amplitude induced by the pomeron has the following form @xmath43 which is supported by the landshoff - nachtmann two - gluon model of the pomeron @xcite .    since at hermes the energy is not very high , it is also necessary to take into account the contribution from secondary reggeons .",
    "the most important reggeons in the reaction under consideration are the @xmath44 , @xmath16 and @xmath1-trajectories .",
    "the usual approach to estimate their contribution to vector meson production is to fix their parameters from some low energy decay amplitudes and from fitting the total and differential elastic cross sections for vector meson production @xcite and @xcite .",
    "therefore the predictive power of such approaches is rather low .    to avoid this problem",
    ", we calculate the contribution from secondary regge exchanges using only information extracted from proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering in analogy to the donnachie - landshoff approach to the calculation of the pomeron contribution to vector meson production @xcite . within our approach",
    "one determines the parameters of the secondary regge exchanges between two quarks from the hadron - hadron cross - sections .",
    "then by using the assumption on a nonrelativistic shape for the vector meson wave function , normalized to the leptonic decay width @xmath35 , one calculates the contribution of any exchanges to the vector meson production amplitude free of parameters .    within this model , using the following forms for effective @xmath44-quark and @xmath16-quark interactions",
    "@xmath45 we obtain for the amplitudes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the value of the coupling of the @xmath48 meson to quarks , and we use for the pion - nucleon coupling @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44-meson form factor of the nucleon is given by @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "for the @xmath16 exchange one has @xmath52 the parameters of the @xmath16 exchange are taken from @xcite : @xmath53=0.55 gev , @xmath54 , @xmath55 = 10.2 , @xmath56 with @xmath57 . in ( [ pion ] ) and ( [ sigma ] ) the regge factor",
    "@xmath58 is @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the mesonic regge trajectory @xmath62 with slope @xmath63 .",
    "we will assume with refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite that the coupling of @xmath1 to the quarks has the same form as that of the pomeron ( [ pom ] ) .",
    "therefore the formula for the @xmath1 amplitude is similar to ( [ pomampl ] ) changing the parameters to : @xmath64 = 3.5 gev@xmath38 , @xmath65 = 1 gev@xmath8 , and the trajectory is now @xmath66 .",
    "the values of parameters have been obtained from a fit to the total hadron - hadron cross - sections @xcite .    in a similar manner",
    "one can obtain the unnatural parity @xmath30trajectory contribution to the @xmath0-meson production amplitude . the @xmath2 interaction with the quarks",
    "is @xmath67 by using this coupling we have for the amplitude , @xmath68 in ( [ f1 ] ) the coupling of @xmath2 to the quarks , @xmath69 = 2.5 , is fixed by using a constituent quark model and the result of the analysis of the proton spin problem within @xmath2 anomalous exchange model @xcite .",
    "the form factor is given by @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "the result of the calculation of @xmath44- , @xmath16- , @xmath15 , @xmath30 contributions to the total elastic @xmath0 photoproduction cross - section as a function of the photon energy @xmath72 are shown in fig.([crs ] ) .",
    "our model describes the experimental data well without tuning the parameters .",
    "it is evident that for hermes kinematics , @xmath73 @xcite , the main contribution to the cross section comes from the pomeron and @xmath1 exchange and the contributions from @xmath44 and @xmath16 exchanges are very small and therefore can be neglected .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath2 exchange near the @xmath0 meson production threshold is smaller then the @xmath44 and @xmath16 contributions .",
    "but due to the very high intercept , the @xmath2 anomalous trajectory , has a non vanishing contribution at hermes energies . due to its unnatural parity and negative signature , the corresponding amplitude is proportional to the product of helicities of the photon and the proton",
    ". therefore the interference of the @xmath2 amplitude with the natural parity amplitudes leads to a nonzero double spin asymmetry , @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the cross - sections for @xmath0-meson production from different photon - proton helicity states . due to the large intercept @xmath18 and negative signature ,",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath2 exchange is real with high accuracy .",
    "therefore one can expect that its interference with the nearly imaginary pomeron amplitude is very small and its contribution to the double - spin asymmetry is also small . at the same time",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude contains a significant real part and , as consequence , the main contribution to the double - spin asymmetry should come from the interference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 exchanges .    within our model",
    "all amplitudes have the same @xmath76 dependence and therefore the double - spin asymmetry does not depend on the value of @xmath76 . in fig.[asymm ] we compare the contribution to the asymmetry from the @xmath2-pomeron ( dotted line ) , @xmath2-@xmath1 ( dashed - dot line ) interferences and the total result ( solid line ) with hermes data for an average photon virtuality @xmath77 = 1.7 gev@xmath8 . in the same figure",
    "we show the result for a slightly different set of @xmath1 trajectory parameters @xcite by a dashed line .",
    "as one can see , the contribution of the @xmath2-pomeron interference is negative and rather small .",
    "the main contribution comes , as it was to be expected , from the @xmath1-@xmath2 interference and the total contribution explains the hermes data within error bars .",
    "we propose a new mechanism to explain the double - spin asymmetry in @xmath0-meson electromagnetic production off the nucleon at intermediate energies .",
    "this mechanism is related to the existence of a new anomalous unnatural parity , negative signature @xmath2 regge trajectory which was introduced recently in @xcite to explain features of diffractive reactions at large momentum transfers and the anomalous behavior of the spin - dependent structure function @xmath21 .",
    "the interference of the @xmath2 exchange with the natural parity @xmath1 secondary reggeon exchange gives the very large contribution to the double spin asymmetry .",
    "the calculated value for the total asymmetry is @xmath78 , which is compatible with the measured value 24@xmath7911% . for @xmath22- and @xmath80 mesons",
    "the main contribution to the double - spin asymmetry should come from interference of pomeron and the @xmath2 trajectory , because the @xmath1 couplings with these mesons vanish in ozi limit .",
    "therefore one can expect small and negative double - spin asymmetries for both mesons .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath2 anomalous exchange gives the biggest contribution to the spin - dependent cross sections of vector meson production , not only at very large energies @xcite , but also in intermediate energy range .",
