    "it was derived more than twenty years ago in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) for the regge region  @xcite , that means summation of all the terms of the type @xmath12 .",
    "recently also the radiative corrections to the kernel of the equation have been calculated  @xcite-@xcite and the explicit form of the kernel in the next - to - leading approximation ( nla ) for the case of forward scattering was found  @xcite .",
    "a number of subsequent papers ( see , for instance  @xcite ) were devoted to the investigation of its consequences .    in the bfkl approach",
    "the high energy scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the green function of two interacting reggeized gluons and of the impact factors of the colliding particles  @xcite .",
    "the bfkl equation allows to determine this green function for forward scattering ( @xmath13 and singlet color state in the @xmath0-channel ) .",
    "the impact factors must be calculated separately and only in some cases ( such as strongly - virtual photon or hard mesons ) perturbation theory is applicable .    the key role in the derivation of the bfkl equation is played by the gluon reggeization .",
    "in the lla the reggeization was noticed in the first orders of the perturbation theory and , assuming that it is correct to all orders , the equation for the @xmath0-channel partial waves of the elastic scattering amplitudes was derived  @xcite .",
    "it is evident that , for gluon quantum numbers in the @xmath0-channel , the solution of this equation must reproduce the gluon reggeization .",
    "this was explicitly demonstrated in ref .",
    "this `` bootstrap '' condition represents a stringent test of the gluon reggeization , although it can not be considered as a proof . in the lla",
    "such proof was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the nla",
    "the gluon reggeization has only been checked in the first three orders of the perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "since it forms the base of the bfkl approach , a more stringent test is desirable . as well as in the lla ,",
    "such test is provided by the `` bootstrap '' condition . using the gluon reggeization as a base , it is possible to represent the high energy scattering amplitudes as a convolution of the impact factors of the colliding particles and of the green function for two interacting reggeized gluons",

    "the first bootstrap condition involves the kernel of the non - forward bfkl equation for octet color representation in the @xmath0-channel , expressed in terms of the effective vertices for the reggeon - reggeon interaction .",
    "the explicit demonstration that it is satisfied in the part concerning the quark  anti - quark contribution was given in ref .",

    "the second bootstrap condition involves the impact factors of the scattered particles for octet color representation in the @xmath0-channel , expressed in terms of the effective vertices for the reggeon - particle interaction . for the case of gluon impact factors , the explicit proof that this equation is satisfied has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite for arbitrary space - time dimension and massive quarks for both the helicity conserving and non - conserving parts .",
    "it must be stressed that for this proof it is sufficient to use the integral representation of the nla non - forward gluon impact factors with color octet states in the @xmath0-channel and it is not necessary to perform explicit integration and to consider other color states .",
    "however , the impact factors have their own value , therefore in ref .  @xcite they have been obtained in the gluon case for arbitrary color representation in the @xmath0-channel and",
    "the explicit integrations have been explicitly carried out in the massless quark case .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to demonstrate the fulfillment of the second bootstrap condition also in the case of quark impact factors , along the same lines as in ref .",
    "we determine an integral representation of the nla non - forward quark impact factors for arbitrary space - time dimension and representation of the color group and check that the second bootstrap condition for the octet representation is satisfied for both the helicity conserving and non - conserving parts .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we explain the method of calculation , in section  3 and  4 we obtain the integral representation of the contributions to the quark impact factors from one - quark and from quark - gluon intermediate states , respectively ; in section  5 the check of the second bootstrap condition is explicitly demonstrated for both the helicity conserving and non - conserving parts ; in section  6 the integrations representing the nla non - forward quark impact factors are carried out in the massless quark case .",
