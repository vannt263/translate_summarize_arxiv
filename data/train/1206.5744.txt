    "we consider a leptonic scenario for the very high energy emission from sn 1006 .",
    "if the @xmath4-ray emission is attributed to zone 1 , the magnetic field required there should be relatively low , around @xmath72 g , resulting in an energy content of @xmath73 erg .",

    "the predicted @xmath4-ray sed flux from zone 2 for this field would be about 5 times lower than the emission from zone 1 at most frequencies , but the lower limit on the magnetic field results from fitting the @xmath4-ray data with the contributions from both zones . in other words",
    ", this range of values is allowed by the uncertainty in the data .",
    "conversely , if a higher value of the magnetic field in zone 1 ( the radio emitting electrons ) is used , the tev fluxes could instead be attributed to zone 2 , where the field should be lower .",

    "also , the break and maximum lorentz factors would be higher than the values used above , and both electron populations would have comparable total energies .",
    "however , this field in zone 2 is not realistic for the observed widths of the filaments . for this reason",
    ", we adopted the parameters described in sections [ imagessection ] and [ magneticfield ] for the rest of the analysis .",
    "we refer to this particular parameter selection as our main leptonic model .",
    "we studied the effect of adding a component of @xmath4-ray emission from hadronic interactions to the modeled non - thermal sed of sn 1006 .",
    "the hadronic emission is calculated as in kamae et al .",
    "@xcite for power - law particle distributions with various slopes .",
    "figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the corresponding models obtained for different hadronic emission levels and particle indices .",
    "when assessing the possible amount of hadronic flux , the parameters for zone 2 were fixed for all the models to the values shown in sections [ imagessection ] and [ magneticfield ] , but the amount of ic emission from zone 1 is varied to maintain consistency with the data as required .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the result of emission models with a steep hadronic population described by a single power - law with index 2.14 .",
    "this value also corresponds to the index of the distributions of the leptonic components .",
    "such a value for the index of the proton distribution is typical of hadronic @xmath4-ray emission used in current sed models , both of snrs and snrs interacting with molecular clouds @xcite .    for the case of the hadronic - dominated scenario ,",
    "the value of the magnetic field in zone 1 is @xmath77 g , resulting in an energy content in electrons of @xmath79 erg .",
    "the shape of the spectrum of the radio - emitting electrons is the same as before , but the required maximum lorentz factor in zone 1 is lower than in the leptonic - dominated scenario .",
    "the maximum particle energy reached by protons , as required by the h.e.s.s .",
    "data , is 90 tev .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the hadronic model over - predicts the flux at gev energies and therefore is not consistent with the limit imposed by observations .",
    "in fact , the same conclusion can be obtained for any power - law proton distributions with an index higher than 2.0 , due to the shape of the resulting spectra ( the @xmath4-ray flux from hadronic interactions maps the particle spectrum directly , see , e.g. , kamae et al . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , hadronic tev emission from a cosmic ray population with index greater than 2.0 at all energies at the level observed by h.e.s.s . is discarded for sn 1006 .    for a proton distribution with index 2.14 , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also shows a scenario where the hadronic emission is the maximum possible that is also compatible with observations .",
    "this is achieved with a magnetic field and energy in zone 1 of @xmath80 g and @xmath81 erg , respectively .",

    "in these two cases , the proton cosmic ray spectrum extends up to 45 tev .",
    "from the simple model presented here , we can conclude that if a value for the magnetic field in zone 2 is used which would reproduces the widths of x - ray filaments near the forward shock of sn 1006 ( @xmath86 g ) , then a leptonic scenario for the @xmath4-ray emission implies that high - energy photons should originate mainly from radio - emitting electrons in zone 1 . in this scenario ,",
    "the required electron spectrum is described by a broken power - law with indices 2.14 ( as required by the radio data ) and 2.8 , and a break around a particle energy of 360 gev , as required by the h.e.s.s .",
    "observations .    for a lower magnetic field in zone 2 ( @xmath87 g ) , the level of the observed @xmath4-ray flux can be attributed mainly to this zone .",
    "we can not rule out either scenario with our current knowledge of the magnetic field .",
    "the shape of the tev spectrum in our model could be improved with a combination of such relatively low magnetic field values in both zones .",
    "the more interesting result obtained from our analysis of the observations is related to the constraints imposed by cumulative observations from the _ fermi _ lat , which allow us to conclude that the tev emission from sn 1006 can not be produced by @xmath0 decay from a hadronic population with a `` soft '' power - law distribution ( i.e. , with an index @xmath88 or higher ) , such as the ones typically used in similar phenomenological models of broad - band seds of snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to stress the fact that our model only rules out hadronic distributions that are single steep power - laws at all energies as the main cause of the tev emission from the source , and which differ from the ones predicted by some nonlinear models with efficient acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the results of the _ fermi _ lat data analysis shown in table [ table1 ] seem to indicate that the data favor a hard spectrum for the emission ( as shown by the increasing values of the ts for lower photon indices ) , which would also be consistent with the hadronic model mentioned above @xcite .",
    "this will only be confirmed with a significant gev detection of the source in the future .    with respect to hadronic emission from a particle population with an index of 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , it is seen that the data are more consistent with mixed leptonic and hadronic contributions ( e.g. , of comparable fluxes at tev energies ) rather than a predominantly hadronic scenario , for which the resulting fluxes are slightly above the gev upper limit .",
    "finally , we point out that despite its problems , a leptonic origin of the non - thermal emission from sn 1006 at all energies would be consistent with the fact that other `` sn 1006-like '' snrs such as rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , show @xmath4-ray spectra and shock structure consistent with leptonic emission @xcite .",
    "also , it has been proposed recently that non - thermal emission from snrs in low density environments ( such as sn 1006 ) is caused primarily by high - energy leptons @xcite .",
    "we can not of course conclude that the tev emission from the source is mainly hadronic or leptonic , but we stress the fact that the data rule out certain hadronic emission models such as the ones that have been used to account for the observations of other young snrs , such as cas a @xcite and tycho s snr @xcite .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysical data system .",
