    "the enrichment of @xmath6-elements ( e.g. , o and mg ) in the universe has different time scales from that of iron - peak elements .",
    "while both @xmath6-elements and iron are produced by sne ii , sne ia produce mostly iron .",
    "the progenitors of sne ia are intermediate mass stars in binary systems and have a lifetime of @xmath7 gyr although there is still debate on the progenitors of sne ia and their lifetime ( e.g. branch 1998 and hillebrandt and niemeyer 2000 for recent reviews ) .",
    "the 1 gyr lifetime of the progenitors of sne ia is longer than those of sne ii , which are massive stars .",

    "emission - lines are emitted from the same ionized zone of the broad line region gas , and their similar wavelengths mean that extinction is similar .",

    "the iron overabundance of low redshift qsos is reproduced by a qso chemical enrichment model assuming rapid star formation and a delay of sne ia events ( hamann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "recently , more than 20 high redshift ( @xmath12 ) qsos have been observed with near - infrared spectroscopy and mg and fe uv and fe ( 3000 - 3500  ) emission - lines were measured ( kawara et al .",

    "goodrich et al . ( 2001 ) made moderate resolution near infrared spectroscopy and revised the redshift to 5.74 measuring the peak of c emission - line . since its redshift of 5.74 corresponds to a cosmological age of 1.0 gyr , sdss 1044 - 0125 is less than 1 gyr old and the progenitor of sne ia in the qso would not have exploded yet .",
    "the fe emission of sdss 1044 - 0125 is expected to be weak .",

    "the spectra of a halogen lamp and a argon lamp were obtained for flat field and wavelength calibration , respectively .",
    "data were reduced using iraf .",

    "sky was removed by subtracting an adjacent exposure with the qso in a different position along the slit .",
    "the sky - subtracted qso frames at the same position along the slit but different airmass were averaged because the low s / n of a single frame hampered a check on whether telluric absorption features were removed . although s / n of the qso s spectra were improved due to averaging , the continuum of the qso in the averaged frame was not bright enough to trace its position .",
    "therefore we first traced the spectra of the telluric absorption correction star , hd 93019 .",
    "this trace was used for extraction of the qso s spectra and the comparison spectra .",
    "the extracted one dimensional comparison spectra were used for wavelength calibration of the qso s extracted one dimensional spectra .",
    "after wavelength calibration of the one dimensional spectra , the spectra of the qso at different position along the slit were combined to produce the qso s spectrum in each wavelength band .",
    "the spectra of hd 93019 were extracted from the sky subtracted frames and wavelength calibrated using one dimensional extracted comparison spectra .",
    "the spectra of hd 93019 obtained at different position along the slit but same airmass were combined to give a spectrum at each airmass in each wavelength band . for relative flux calibration , we divided the spectra of hd 93019 by a 5560 k blackbody spectrum to make relative sensitivity functions including telluric absorption . since the qso spectra obtained at different airmasses",
    "were combined into a single spectrum , we averaged relative sensitivity functions at different airmasses to correct telluric absorption and instrument sensitivity .",

    "<S> we obtained near - infrared spectroscopy of the @xmath0=5.74 qso , sdssp j104433.04 - 012502.2 with the infrared camera and spectrograph of the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift of 5.74 corresponds to a cosmological age of 1.0 gyr for the current @xmath1-dominated cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we found a similar strength of the fe ( 3000 - 3500  ) emission lines in sdssp j104433.04 - 012502.2 as in low redshift qsos . </S>",
    "<S> this is the highest redshift detection of iron . </S>",
    "<S> we subtracted a power - law continuum from the spectrum and fitted model fe emission and balmer continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the rest equivalent width of fe ( 3000 - 3500  ) is @xmath2    which is similar to those of low redshift qsos measured by the same manner . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical enrichment models that assume the life time of the progenitor of sne ia is longer than 1 gyr predict that weaker fe emission than low redshift . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of the observed high redshift ( @xmath3 ) qsos show a systematic decrease of fe emission compared with low redshift qsos . </S>",
    "<S> this may due to a shorter lifetime of sne ia in qso nuclei than in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> another reason of strong fe emission at @xmath4 may be longer cosmological age due to smaller @xmath5 . </S>"
