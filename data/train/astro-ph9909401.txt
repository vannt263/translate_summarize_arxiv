    "there has been much recent debate on the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of low surface brightness disc galaxies ( lsbgs ; galaxies with @xmath1 band central surface brightnesses fainter than 22.5 magarcsec@xmath2 ) .",
    "the best studied lsbgs are blue in the optical and the near - infrared ( near - ir ) @xcite , indicating a young mean stellar age and/or low metallicity .",
    "their measured region metallicities are low , at around or below @xmath3 solar abundance @xcite .",
    "morphologically , the best studied lsbgs have discs , but little spiral structure @xcite . the current massive star formation rates ( sfrs ) in lsbgs are an order of magnitude lower than those of high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "observations show that lsbgs have high gas mass fractions , sometimes even approaching unity @xcite . as",
    "yet , there have been no co detections of lsbgs , only upper limits on the co abundances which indicate that lsbgs have co / ratios significantly lower than those of hsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "all of these observations are consistent with a scenario in which lsbgs are relatively unevolved , low mass surface density , low metallicity systems , with roughly constant or even increasing sfrs @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario has difficulty accommodating giant lsbgs ( as , indeed , this scenario was not designed with giant lsbgs in mind ) : with scale lengths typically in excess of 510 @xmath4 kpc , these galaxies are similar to , but less extreme than , malin 1 .",
    "quillen & pickering , in an as yet unpublished work , obtained near - ir @xmath5 band imaging of two giant lsbgs .",
    "they concluded that the central optical  near - ir colours of their galaxies were compatible with those seen in old stellar populations ( such as e / s0 galaxies ) , and that the ( more uncertain ) outer colours were consistent with somewhat younger stellar populations .",
    "another difficulty for this scenario is posed by the recent discovery of a substantial population of red lsbgs @xcite .",
    "the optical colours of these galaxies are similar to those of old stellar populations , but the red colours could be caused by age or metallicity effects ( note that dust is not expected to be an important effect in most face - on lsbgs ; section [ subsec : dust ] ) .",
    "either way , the existence of old or metal - rich lsbgs is difficult to understand if all lsbgs are unevolved and gas - rich . this same age - metallicity degeneracy plagues the analysis of the colours of blue lsbgs .",
    "padoan , jimenez & antonuccio - delogu question the apparent youth of blue lsbg stellar populations : they find that lsbg optical colours are consistent with those of old , very low metallicity stellar populations .",
    "this uncertainty caused by the age / metallicity degeneracy is partially avoidable ; for stellar populations with ongoing star formation , it is possible to learn something of their sfh using a combination of optical and near - ir colours .",
    "essentially , it is possible to compare the sfhs of galaxies in a relative sense , using a kind of ` birthrate parameter ' relating the amount of recent star formation to the cumulative amount of previous star formation ( in this work , we parameterise the sfhs using an exponential sfh with a timescale @xmath6 ) . as a guide to interpreting these optical and near - ir colours",
    ", we use the latest multi - metallicity stellar population synthesis models of e.g.  bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) and kodama & arimoto . the limiting factor in applying this technique",
    "is typically the availability of near - ir imaging ; especially so for lsbgs , where the near - ir central surface brightness can be up to a factor of 500 fainter than the sky surface brightness at these wavelengths .    in this paper , we present optical and near - ir imaging for a diverse sample of 26 lsbgs in order to explore their sfhs . in our study",
    "we include examples of i ) the well - studied blue - selected lsbgs taken from de blok et al .  ,",
    "de jong & van der kruit and the eso - lv catalogue , ii ) the more poorly studied , intriguing red - selected lsbgs from oneil et al .  , and iii ) the lsbg giants , taken from sprayberry et al .  .",
    "earlier results of this programme were presented in bell et al . , where the stellar populations in a subset of five red and blue lsbgs were explored ; red lsbgs were found to be much older and metal - rich than blue lsbgs , indicating that the two classes of galaxy do not share a common origin . here , we explore the differences in sfh between red , blue and giant lsbgs",
    ". we also attempt to understand which , if any , galaxy parameters ( e.g.  mass , or density ) affect the sfhs of lsbgs , driving the differences between e.g.  red and blue lsbgs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section [ sec : obs ] . in section [ sec : phot ] we present the photometry for our sample , compare with existing published photometry , and discuss the morphologies of lsbgs in the optical and the near - ir . in section [ sec : sfh ] we present the optical  near - ir colours for our sample of galaxies , discussing them in terms of differences in sfh . in section [ sec :",
    "disc ] , we elaborate on this colour - based analysis and explore trends in sfh with physical parameters",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "our sample of 26 lsbgs was selected with a number of criteria in mind",
    ". they must be detectable using reasonable exposure times on 4-m class telescopes in the near - ir , and must span a wide range of observed lsbg properties , such as physical size , surface brightness and colour .",
    "in addition , we selected galaxies with as much existing optical and data as possible .",
    "our sample is by no means complete , but is designed instead to span as wide a range as possible of observed lsbg parameters .",
    "our northern sample was selected from a number of sources @xcite to have moderately low published @xmath1 band inclination corrected central surface brightness @xmath7 magarcsec@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the northern sample was selected to have major axis radii to the 25 @xmath1 magarcsec@xmath2 isophote larger than @xmath8 16 arcsec .",
    "galaxies with only moderately low surface brightness were chosen as the near - ir sky background at temperate sites is very high due to the large thermal flux from the telescope and sky .    in order to explore the properties of galaxies with even lower surface brightnesses , we imaged a small sample of galaxies using the south pole 0.6-m telescope .",
    "the @xmath0 band sky background at the south pole is suppressed by a factor of @xmath9 compared to temperate sites , allowing unprecedented sensitivity for faint extended @xmath0 band surface photometry ( see e.g. nguyen et al .  1996 ,",
    "rauscher et al .  1998 ) .",
    "our southern hemisphere sample is selected from the eso - uppsula catalogue @xcite to have larger sizes and lower surface brightnesses compared to the northern sample : @xmath10 magarcsec@xmath2 , 65 arcsec @xmath11 r@xmath12 arcsec , inclination less than 67@xmath13 and galactic latitude @xmath14 to avoid excessive foreground galactic extinction ( where r@xmath15 denotes the galaxy half light radius ) .",
    "our sample is described in further detail in table [ tab : samplepar ] .",
    "galaxy types and heliocentric velocities were typically taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "galaxy distances @xmath16 were determined from velocities centred on the local group @xcite assuming a a hubble constant @xmath17 of 65 kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 . for galaxies within @xmath8 150 mpc , we further take into account the local bulk peculiar motions @xcite .",
    "typical distance uncertainties , corresponding to the uncertainties in the peculiar motions , are typically @xmath8 7 mpc .",
    "gas masses were calculated using @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 is the line flux in jy and @xmath21 is the line width in kms@xmath18 .",
    "fluxes were taken from ned , except for the fluxes from de blok et al .  , sprayberry et al .   and oneil , bothun & schombert .",
    "note that in table [ tab : samplepar ] all the galaxies without masses have not yet been observed in c1 - 4 and c3 - 2 , which were not detected with arecibo in 5 @xmath22 5 minutes and 12 @xmath22 5 minutes respectively ( these limits roughly correspond to 3@xmath23 upper limits on the gas fraction of @xmath8 15 per cent ) . in table [",

    "the exponential profile has an extrapolated central surface brightness @xmath29 ( in linear units ) , and an exponential disc scale length @xmath30 .",
    "the de vaucouleurs profile has a surface brightness @xmath31 in linear units at the half - light radius @xmath32 .",
    "these exponential or @xmath28 law model profiles were convolved with a gaussian with a fwhm equal to the seeing quality before fitting .",
    "the sky level was not permitted to vary when performing these fits .",
    "independent fitting for each passband was carried out using the method of levenberg and marquardt @xcite .",
    "the reduced @xmath33 statistic was used to determine the quality of the fit ( using the measured rms in each ellipse as the error in the flux in that ellipse ) ; @xmath33 was minimised for each of the four types of fit , and the best values of @xmath33 for each fitting function compared .",
    "one fitting function was chosen in preference to another if its @xmath33 was on average better , over most of the passbands .",
    "most cases were clear cut , with reductions in @xmath33 by a factor of two or more compared to the other three fitting functions .",
    "however , there were two main types of marginal case where the difference between minimum @xmath33 for two models was small ( i.e.   less than @xmath8 10 per cent ) , and the best model varied between passbands . one case is where there is no evidence for a bulge component in the bluer passbands , but tentative evidence for an exponential bulge component in the red passbands . in this case , a disc only fit is chosen for simplicity . the other marginal case arises when a galaxy with a strong bulge is fit by an exponential or de vaucouleurs bulge equally well : in this case , the choice of bulge profile is fairly arbitrary , and the choice is made to minimise systematic deviations of the fit from the data .",
    "these two types of case are both flagged in table [ tab : bulgedisc ] .    in a number of cases ,",
    "the disc parameters are relatively ill - constrained , as there is significant structure in the surface brightness profile in some of the bluer passbands , or in the @xmath34 profile .",
    "this structure is typically due to the low signal - to - noise of the data ( especially in @xmath35 or @xmath34 bands ) , by real structure in the surface brightness profile caused by e.g.  recent star formation ( affecting the @xmath35 and @xmath1 band profiles particularly ) or by asymmetries in the most irregular lsbgs in our sample . in these cases ,",
    "we have chosen to fix some of the fit parameters to achieve a better convergence .",
    "we usually choose to fix the disc scale length , as it is possible to use the disc scale lengths in other passbands , along with the mean variation in scale length with passband @xcite , to estimate the scale length in this colour . while clearly not optimal , this method allows us to use the same functional form for fitting the surface brightness profile for all the different passbands .",
    "cases where the fit has been constrained have been flagged in table [ tab : bulgedisc ] .",
    "we show a comparison between our measurements of total galaxy magnitude , disc central surface brightness and disc scale length and the corresponding literature measurements in all available passbands in fig.[fig : comp ] .",
    "note that there is a mean offset in magnitude of @xmath360.28 mag between our magnitudes and those of sprayberry et al .",
    "( stars in fig.[fig : comp ] ) .",
    "this offset does not significantly affect the colours of the galaxies as it is constant over all passbands .",
    "the source of this offset is unknown , however if it is corrected for their magnitudes agree with ours with a rms of @xmath8 0.1 mag .",
    "therefore , in fig.[fig : comp ] and the subsequent comparison , we correct sprayberry et al.s magnitudes for this offset . for the complete sample , 68 per cent of the magnitude differences are smaller than 0.17 mag ( 68 per cent interval ) , and 50 per cent of the magnitude differences are smaller than 0.09 mag . for the central surface brightnesses and scale lengths ,",
    "the 68 per cent intervals are 0.33 magarcsec@xmath2 and 18 per cent , respectively .",
    "the distributions of all of these residuals are strongly non - gaussian , with a relatively narrow ` core ' of accurate comparisons with a more extended envelope of less accurate comparisons , with a few pathological cases .",
    "it is important to understand the origin of the larger magnitude errors .",
    "many of the less accurate magnitude comparisons are from very extended galaxies , which have a large portion of their flux outside the boundaries of the detector . hence their magnitudes are less accurate due to the more uncertain sky levels and larger total magnitude extrapolations",
    ". these less accurate comparisons may be a concern however : do our quoted uncertainties reflect the true uncertainties ? to check this , we compared the ratio of the magnitude difference and the combined measurement errors : the median value of this ratio is @xmath8 0.8 . therefore , we conclude that our formal magnitude error bars are an accurate reflection of the true uncertainties .    the central surface brightnesses and scale lengths compare less favourably , with many of the central surface brightnesses in particular disagreeing by more than their combined formal error bars .",
    "however , the formal error bars only give the estimated errors for a given fitting method .",
    "in this case , we have compared our measurements derived using an automated bulge / disc decomposition with measurements derived using a variety of fitting methods , including ` marking the disc ' fits @xcite , disc only fits to the whole surface brightness profile @xcite , bulge / disc decompositions similar to those presented here @xcite , and sophisticated two - dimensional modelling of the luminosity distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , the formal errors derived using each method are unlikely to reflect the true uncertainties introduced by the use of different fitting methods .",
    "an additional source of scatter is the presence of a bulge component : when included , a bulge component can take some of the light from the disc component , and increase the uncertainty in the disc parameters accordingly .",
    "we conclude that the formal errors for the central surface brightness and scale length are unlikely to represent the true range of uncertainties introduced by using different fitting methods : more representative uncertainties are given by the 68 per cent intervals and are @xmath8 0.3 mag and @xmath8 20 per cent respectively : these uncertainties are comparable to those found by e.g.  de jong and de blok et al .  .",
    "we have also compared our adopted ellipticities and position angles with those in our sample s source papers .",
    "our ellipticities compare well with those in the literature : most galaxies have ellipticity differences of @xmath37 or smaller .",
    "a few galaxies have ellipticity differences greater than 0.1 ; these differences are typically due to the influence of bars , or due to low signal - to - noise in both sets of images .",
    "comparison of our adopted position angles with those in the literature shows agreement to @xmath8 7@xmath13 .",
    "it is interesting to compare and comment on the morphologies and surface brightness profiles of lsbgs in the optical and the near - ir .",
    "bergvall et al .   found a tendency towards similar morphologies in the optical and near - ir for their sample of lsbgs .",
    "we confirm this trend ( despite our typically poorer signal - to - noise in the near - ir ) : this suggests that lsbgs lack the dust content and significant amounts of recent star formation that make morphological classification so passband - dependent for galaxies with higher surface brightness @xcite .    our sample , because of its explicit selection to cover as wide a range of lsbg parameters as possible , has a wide range of morphologies , and as is discussed in the next section , sfhs .",
    "the red selected lsbg subsample contains a lenticular galaxy ( c1 - 4 ) , two early type spirals , and two later type spirals .",
    "oneil et al .  ,",
    "because of their typically lower spatial resolution , did not find strong evidence for bulges in most of the red lsbgs .",
    "however , with our higher resolution data ( usually the int 2.5-m @xmath38 band images ) , we find that four out of the five red selected lsbgs show evidence for an exponential bulge component .",
    "the lsbg giants all have very strong bulges , with bulge to disc ratios of the order of unity in most passbands .",
    "two lsbg giants are better fit with an exponential bulge component , and the rest are better fit ( in the @xmath33 sense ) by a @xmath28 law bulge profile .",
    "the discs of lsbg giants usually have pronounced spiral structure ( see , e.g.  sprayberry et al .",
    "1995 for images ) .",
    "the blue selected lsbgs come with a variety of morphologies , from relatively well - defined spiral morphologies with weak bulges , to galaxies with nearly exponential disc profiles , to galaxies with central ` troughs ' in their luminosity profiles , compared with expectations from an exponential disc fit .",
    "two examples of these ` trough ' galaxies are eso - lv 1040220 and 1040440 .",
    "these galaxies have galactic extinction and inclination corrected central surface brightnesses in @xmath1 of 24.1 and 23.4 magarcsec@xmath2 respectively .",
    "thus , in many respects , they are similar to the blue lsbgs studied by bergvall et al .  .",
    "they found that at surface brightnesses lower than @xmath8 23 @xmath1 magarcsec@xmath2 , centrally - depressed surface brightness profiles are quite common . on the basis of this limited and incomplete sample , it is difficult to properly confirm their finding , but our analysis of the surface brightness profiles certainly tentatively supports their observation .    in table",
    "[ tab : bulgedisc ] , and to a certain extent fig.[fig : surfphot ] , it is apparent that the disc scale lengths typically decrease and the bulge to disc ratios increase with increasing wavelength .",
    "these are clear signatures of colour gradients in our sample of lsbgs . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate these colour gradients : we will argue that these are primarily due to stellar population gradients .",
    "the main motivation for this programme of optical and near - ir imaging was to study the stellar populations of a diverse sample of lsbgs . in this section ,",
    "we construct accurate colours as a function of radius for our sample and compare these colours with model stellar populations .",
    "we first degrade all of the edited images of a given galaxy to the same angular resolution , and carry out surface photometry in three radial bins : @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the @xmath0 band disc scale length .",
    "galactic extinction corrections were taken from schlegel et al .   .",
    "k - corrections for the lsbg giants ( as they are at non - negligible redshifts ) were computed using non - evolving sbc spectra from king & ellis , and are typically 0.2 mag in @xmath1 , negligible in @xmath38 and @xmath43 mag in @xmath0 .",
    "if required , @xmath34 magnitudes were converted @xmath0 magnitudes using the relation in wainscoat & cowie , assuming a typical @xmath44 colour of @xmath8 0.3 mag @xcite .",
    "the error in this correction is unlikely to exceed 0.05 mag .",
    "we show galactic extinction and k - corrected @xmath45 and @xmath46 colours for our sample of lsbgs in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcol ] . measurements in the three radial bins per galaxy are connected by solid lines , measurements of the central bin are denoted by a solid circle and measurements of the colours at two @xmath0 band disc scale lengths are denoted by open circles .",
    "note that we only show colours with uncertainties smaller than 0.3 mag .",
    "average zero point uncertainties and uncertainties in the inner and outer points due to sky level errors are also shown . because @xmath38 band is used in both colour combinations , errors in @xmath38 band affect both colours .",
    "accordingly , the average 1@xmath23 @xmath38 band error is also shown ( the short diagonal line ) .",
    "a @xmath45 against @xmath46 colour - colour plot was chosen to maximise the number of galaxies on the diagram .",
    "other colour combinations ( e.g.  @xmath47 against @xmath46 , etc . ) limit the number of galaxies that can be plotted , but yield consistent positions on the stellar population grids . note that p1 - 7 is placed on the plot assuming a @xmath48 colour of @xmath49 ( derived from the degenerate @xmath47 against @xmath48 colour - colour diagram using a typical galactic extinction corrected colour for p1 - 7 of @xmath50 ) .",
    "overplotted on the same diagram are stellar population models and model dust reddening vectors .",
    "we use the gissel98 implementation of the stellar population models of bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) . for fig.[fig :",
    "colcol ] we adopt a salpeter initial mass fuction ( imf ) and an exponentially decreasing star formation rate characterised by an e - folding timescale @xmath6 and a single , fixed stellar metallicity @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the adopted solar metallicity ) . for these models , the galaxy age ( i.e.  the time since star formation first started in the galaxy )",
    "is fixed at 12 gyr .",
    "note that the shape of the model grid is almost independent of galaxy age @xmath53 5 gyr .",
    "the solid grey lines represent the colours of stellar populations with a fixed metallicity and a variety of star formation timescales .",
    "the dashed grey lines represent the colours of stellar populations with different , fixed stellar metallicities and a given star formation timescale .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the shape and placement of the model grid : charlot , worthey and bressan discussed the sources of error in stellar population synthesis models , and concluded that the uncertainty in model calibration for older stellar populations is @xmath8 0.1 mag in @xmath45 and @xmath8 0.2 mag in @xmath46 , which is roughly comparable to the calibration error bars in fig.[fig : colcol ] .",
    "the colour uncertainties are larger for some stellar populations than for others : e.g.the optical  near - ir colours for older , near - solar metallicity stellar populations are relatively secure , whilst the colours for younger , extreme metallicity stellar populations are much more uncertain .",
    "other sources of systematic error include dust reddening and sfh uncertainties ( as our assumption of a smoothly varying sfr is almost certainly unrealistic ) . for these reasons",
    "the positions of galaxies and colour trends between galaxies should be viewed relatively , e.g.  that one class of galaxies is more metal - rich than another class of galaxies .",
    "we also include vectors describing the effect of dust reddening using either a screen model ( arrow ) or the more realistic geometry of a triplex dust model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* curved line ) .",
    "for the triplex model a closed circle denotes the central reddening , and an open circle the reddening at 2.5 disc scale lengths . for both reddening vectors",
    "we use the milky way extinction law ( and for the triplex model , the albedo ) from gordon , calzetti & witt .",
    "our triplex model assumes equal scale length vertically and radially exponential dust and stellar distributions , and a central optical depth ( for viewing a background object ) in @xmath54 band of 2 .",
    "these parameters are designed to be a reasonable upper limit to the effects of reddening in most reasonably bright spiral galaxies : kuchinski et al .",
    "find from their study of 15 highly - inclined spiral galaxies that they are well - described by the above type of model , with central @xmath54 band optical depths of between 0.5 and 2 . for the purposes of calculating the triplex reddening vector",
    ", we use the optical depth due to absorption only for two reasons .",
    "firstly , one might navely expect that for face - on galaxies at least as many photons will get scattered into the line of sight as out of it .",
    "secondly , de jong finds that an absorption - only triplex model is a reasonably accurate description of the results of his realistic monte - carlo simulation ( including the effects of both scattering and absorption ) of a face - on triplex geometry spiral galaxy .      in the following interpretation of fig.[fig : colcol ] , we for the most part _ explicitly neglect the possible effects of dust reddening_. there are a number of arguments that suggest that the effects of dust reddening , while present , are less important than stellar population differences both within and between galaxies .",
    "we consider these effects more carefully in section [ subsec : dust ] .",
    "the majority of the lsbgs in our sample with colours in at least two radial bins have significant optical  near - ir colour gradients . for the most part _",
    "these colour gradients are consistent with the presence of a mean stellar age gradient _ , where the outer regions of galaxies are typically younger , on average , than the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of de jong who concludes that age gradients are common in spiral galaxies of all types .",
    "note that this is inconsistent with the conclusions of bergvall et al .",
    ", who find little evidence for optical  near - ir colour gradients in their sample of blue lsbgs .",
    "however , their sample was explicitly selected to lack significant @xmath45 colour gradients , and so that we disagree with their conclusion is not surprising .",
    "the fact that bergvall et al .  managed to find galaxies without significant colour gradients is interesting in itself ;",
    "while colour gradients are common amongst disc galaxies , _ they are by no means universally present_. this is an important point , as by studying the systematic differences in physical properties between galaxies with and without colour gradients , it may be possible to identify the physical mechanism by which an age gradient is generated in disc galaxies .",
    "there are galaxies which have colour gradients which appear inconsistent with the presence of an age gradient alone .",
    "the two early - type lsbgs c1 - 4 and c3 - 2 have small colour gradients which are more consistent with small metallicity gradients than with age gradients .",
    "in addition , a few of the bluer late - type lsbgs have colour gradients that are rather steeper than expected on the basis of age gradients alone , most notably f583 - 1 and p1 - 7 , both of which appear to have colour gradients more consistent with a metallicity gradient .",
    "eso 1040440 has an ` inverse ' colour gradient , in that the central regions are bluer than the outer regions : this is probably due to a combination of very irregular morphology and the effects of foreground stellar contamination ( which in this case makes the galaxy colours difficult to accurately estimate ) .",
    "there are also conspicuous ` kinks ' in the colour profiles of f574 - 1 and 2327 - 0244 , and a possible kink in the colour profile of ugc 128 . in the case of f574 - 1 ,",
    "it is likely that the central colours of the galaxy are heavily affected by dust reddening .",
    "f574 - 1 is quite highly inclined ( @xmath55 , assuming an intrinsic disc axial ratio @xmath56 of 0.15 ; holmberg 1958 ) and shows morphological indications of substantial amounts of dust extinction in the int 2.5-m @xmath1 and @xmath54 band images",
    ". this may also be the case for ugc 128 , although the inclination is smaller in this case and there are no clear - cut morphological indications of substantial dust reddening .",
    "the lsbg giant 2327 - 0244 has a red nucleus in the near - ir , but a relatively blue nucleus in the optical .",
    "however , 2327 - 0244 is is a seyfert 1 and has a central starburst @xcite , making our interpretation of the central colours in terms of exponentially decreasing sfr models invalid .      in considering colour trends between lsbgs",

    "this relative youth , compared to the typically higher surface brightness sample of de jong suggests that the age of a galaxy may be more closely related to its surface brightness than the metallicity is .",

    "smc extinction and albedo curves make little difference to the direction of the reddening vectors , but increases the length of the triplex model reddening vector slightly because of the lower albedo at all wavelengths , compared to the milky way dust properties . the screen model vector is shown for illustrative purposes only , as the dust will be distributed roughly similarly to the starlight in realistic spiral galaxies , as assumed in the triplex model .",
    "the colour gradients in our sample of lsbgs are unlikely to be due to the effects of dust reddening for four reasons .    1 .",

    "the triplex model assumes that all of the dust is distributed smoothly throughout the galaxy . in real galaxies",
    "typically 1/3 of the dust is gathered into optically thick clumps , which , when viewed face - on , simply tend to ` drill holes ' in the light distribution but not produce any significant colour changes @xcite .",
    "this dust would be more easily found in more edge - on galaxies , as in the edge - on orientation the probability of a clump along the line of sight is much larger than in a face - on disc .",
    "therefore , kuchinski et al.s dust optical depths are likely to account for both the clumped and unclumped dust .",
    "most lsbgs have lower metallicity than their higher surface brightness counterparts .",
    "this implies that the dust to gas ratio should be lower in lsbgs than in hsbgs .",
    "4 .   only one galaxy in our sample , the starbursting seyfert 1 2327 - 0244 , has been detected by iras .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the diameter limited sample of de jong & van der kruit , for which 78 per cent of the sample was detected by iras .",
    "this suggests that dust is much less important in lsbgs than in their higher surface brightness counterparts : indeed , many of the non - detections in de jong & van der kruit s sample were lsbgs .",
    "the above arguments suggest that the triplex dust reddening vector in fig.[fig : colcol ] is an upper limit to the real effects of dust reddening .",
    "comparison of this upper limit on the dust reddening effects with the colour gradients in our sample suggests that most galaxies must have stellar population gradients to produce such pronounced colour gradients .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the direct modelling of kuchinski et al .  , who use their own best - fit galaxy models to estimate the colour gradients in face - on spiral galaxies :",
    "they conclude that colour gradients as large as the ones we observe in lsbgs , or observed by de jong , are too large to arise solely from reddening by realistic amounts of dust .",
    "the same argument applies to relating different populations of lsbg : the amount of reddening required to make an intrinsically blue lsbg appear red is too large to be compatible with the observational evidence cited above .",
    "in section [ subsec : sfhres ] , we saw a pronounced age / metallicity sequence .",
    "lsbgs can have a diverse range of stellar populations : red selected lsbgs can be quite old and metal rich , whilst most blue selected lsbgs are much younger , and more metal poor .",
    "however , from fig.[fig : colcol ] alone , it is difficult to see _ why _ the star formation histories of low surface brightness galaxies are as diverse as they are .",
    "for this reason , we have chosen to quantify the positions of galaxies on the colour - colour plane by assigning average ages and metallicities from the gissel98 stellar population models of bruzual & charlot ( in preparation ) .",
    "a finely interpolated grid of stellar population models was generated , covering a range of star formation timescales and metallicities .",
    "the metallicity ranges from @xmath67 ( 1/100 solar ) to @xmath68 ( 2.5 times solar ) . in fig.[fig : colcol ] , we can see that some galaxies have optical  near - ir colours too blue to be described adequately by a constant star formation rate : for this reason , we must include exponentially _ increasing _ sfhs in our model grid .",
    "we include star formation timescales @xmath6 ranging from 0 ( an average age of 12 gyr ) to @xmath69 ( constant star formation with an average age of 6 gyr ) to @xmath70 gyr ( an average age of 1 gyr ) .",
    "we can see from the range of models included above that @xmath6 is an inappropriate parameter for describing the sfhs : we parameterise the sfh using the average age of the stellar population .    for each galaxy , the galactic extinction and k - corrected @xmath45 and @xmath46 colours between @xmath40 ( when available ; 0052 - 0119 and 0237 - 0159 have only central colours and are omitted from further consideration ) are compared with the colours of the finely interpolated stellar populations grid .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 is minimised , where @xmath72 is the model colour , @xmath73 is the observed colour and @xmath74 is the error in the observed colour .",
    "error bars are obtained for the average ages and metallicities by fitting the colours plus or minus their 1@xmath23 sky level and zero point errors added in quadrature .",
    "this procedure has a number of limitations .",
    "firstly , we neglect the effects of dust reddening .",
    "we considered the possible effects of dust earlier in section [ subsec : dust ] , and concluded that the effects of dust are fairly minimal for this sample .",
    "our use of the colours between @xmath40 should act to further lessen the importance of dust reddening on our results . secondly , because we use simple sfhs assuming a single metallicity , and because of stellar population model uncertainties , the ages and metallicities we determine are unlikely to be accurate in absolute terms .",
    "however , the idea of this simple analysis is to identify relative trends in sfh and metallicity , and their possible causes .",
    "the ages and metallicities we derive here will serve this purpose well : the optical  near - ir colours provide a robust way to order galaxies in terms of the relative importance of @xmath53 5 gyr old stars compared to younger @xmath64 2 gyr old stars , which we parameterise using the average age of the stellar population . to better understand the relative uncertainties , we have also carried out the analysis using the stellar population models of kodama & arimoto : the results obtained with their models are indistinguishable ( in a relative sense ) to the results presented in figs .",

    "note that some low surface brightness dwarf spheroidals may run counter to this argument , having low metallicities and reasonably old average ages ( e.g.  mateo 1998 ) : to explain this one would have to invoke removal of the gas from these low mass galaxies by e.g.supernova-driven winds @xcite or , for cluster dwarf spheroidals , ram - pressure stripping @xcite .      in panels",

    "metallicity , unlike age , seems to be correlated with @xmath0 band disc scale length .",
    "this seems primarily because of the lsbg giants : they are bright and have large scale lengths , so their high metallicities will produce correlations between metallicity and magnitude and metallicity and scale length .",
    "it is likely that a metallicity  magnitude relation is more fundamental , however it is impossible to rule out scale length dependence in the metallicity on the basis of this dataset .",
    "metallicity , like age , seems to correlate well with @xmath0 band surface brightness , magnitude and gas fraction in the sense that lsbgs with lower metallicities have lower surface brightnesses , lower luminosities and higher gas fractions than lsbgs with higher metallicities .",
    "both age and metallicity are also linked ( panel d ) , so the similarity in trends with physical parameters between age and metallicity is not surprising . again , as was the case for the age , it is more or less impossible to tell , on the basis of this dataset alone , which of the magnitude  metallicity or surface brightness ",
    "metallicity correlations are more fundamental .      in order to investigate how the _ baryonic _ mass and surface density affect the sfhs of lsbgs , we have modified the @xmath0 surface brightnesses and absolute magnitudes by turning the neutral gas fraction of the galaxy into stars using the correction to the magnitude @xmath82 .",

    "the @xmath0 band mass - to - light ratio is expected to be relatively robust to the presence of young stellar populations , however our assumption of a constant @xmath0 band mass to light ratio is still a crude assumption .",
    "note however that the relative trends in fig.[fig : correl2 ] are quite robust to changes in stellar mass - to - light ratio : as the stellar mass - to - light ratio increases , the modified magnitudes creep closer to their unmodified values asymptotically .",
    "the presence of molecular gas is not accounted for in this correction .",
    "assuming a typical galactic co to h@xmath83 conversion ratio , the non - detections of lsbgs by schombert et al .   and de blok & van der hulst imply h@xmath83 to ratios smaller than 0.25 , and exceptionally as low as 0.04 .",
    "this result is complicated by the expected metallicity dependence in the co to h@xmath83 conversion ratio @xcite , however , molecular hydrogen is unlikely to dominate for all plausible values of the conversion factor .",
    "the correction to the surface brightness implicitly assumes that the gas will turn into stars with the same spatial distribution as the present - day stellar component .",
    "this is a poor assumption as the gas distribution is usually much more extended than the stellar distribution ; most lsbg gas distributions are centrally peaked however , and so the correction is unlikely to be completely wrong .",
    "all of the above arguments suggest that the modified magnitudes and surface brightnesses are unlikely to give an accurate measure of the true masses and densities of lsbgs .",
    "these quantities do however better reflect the total mass and density of the galaxy than the @xmath0 band magnitudes and surface brightnesses alone , and so are useful as an indication of the kind of trends we might see if we could work out the baryonic masses and densities of lsbgs .",
    "the median correction is -0.9 mag , and 68 per cent of the corrections lie within 0.7 mag of this value .",
    "the trends in age and metallicity with modified @xmath0 band central surface brightness and absolute magnitude are shown in fig.[fig : correl2 ] .",
    "three red and giant lsbgs with known redshifts but unknown ( or unmeasurable ) fluxes have been placed on fig.[fig : correl2 ] also : error bars denote their ( unmodified ) magnitudes or surface brightnesses , and solid triangles denote the direction that these galaxies move in with increasing gas fraction , with the vertex of the triangle indicating the offset that is produced by converting a gas fraction of 0.2 into stars . for reference , in panels c and f , we also show the relationship between @xmath1 band magnitude and surface brightness and the modified @xmath0 band magnitude and surface brightness .",
    "surprisingly , we find that @xmath1 band magnitude and surface brightness are reasonable reflections of the modified magnitudes and surface brightnesses of lsbgs ( remembering the uncertain assumptions that went into constructing the modified magnitudes and surface brightnesses ) .",
    "both the @xmath1 band magnitudes and surface brightnesses have a mean offset from the modified @xmath0 band values consistent with a + 3.9 mag offset , with an rms of around 0.5 mag ( solid and dotted lines in panels c and f ) .",
    "this relationship may be caused by the sensitivity of the optical mass to light ratios to recent star formation : @xmath1 band mass to light ratios decrease for younger populations in a such a way as to make the increase in brightness for younger populations offset almost exactly ( to within a factor of 60 per cent or so , from the 0.5 mag scatter ) by their larger gas fractions , making the @xmath1 band a reasonable total mass indicator in lsbgs ( assuming that the @xmath0 band stellar mass to light ratio is fairly constant ) .    in panels a and b of fig.[fig : correl2 ]",
    ", we see that the lsbg ages and metallicities correlate with their modified @xmath0 band magnitudes ( baryonic masses ) . in stark contrast , in panels d and e , we see that the ages and metallicities correlate poorly with the modified @xmath0 band surface brightnesses ( baryonic surface densities ) .",
    "this result is puzzling , especially in the light of the tight correlation between average age and surface brightness in panel e of fig.[fig : correl ] .",
    "there are two possible interpretations of this huge scatter in the age",
    " modified surface brightness plane .",
    "is it possible that there is little or no correlation between the sfh and surface density of a galaxy , as panels d and e suggest ? in this case , we must explain the strong correlations between age and @xmath0 band surface brightness and metallicity and @xmath0 band surface brightness in panels e and i of fig.[fig : correl ] .",
    "this may be possible to explain via selection effects : because we selected our galaxies to have a relatively narrow range of @xmath1 band surface brightness , and older , more metal rich galaxies are redder , we would naturally expect to see an artificial correlation between @xmath0 band surface brightness ( which would be higher because of the redder colours ) and age ( which correlates with these red colours ) .",
    "note , however , that this interpretation has real difficulty in explaining the tightness and dynamic range of the age@xmath0 band surface brightness correlation .",
    "conversely , is it possible that there is a correlation between baryonic surface density and age , and that for some reason it is masked in this dataset ?",
    "there is quite a narrow range ( only @xmath8 2 magarcsec@xmath2 ) of modified surface brightness : the close correspondence between @xmath1 band and modified @xmath0 band surface brightnesses ( panel f of fig.[fig : correl2 ] ) means that because we selected our galaxies to have a relatively narrow range of @xmath1 band surface brightness , we have implicitly selected for a narrow range in baryonic central surface density . also , our modifications to the surface brightnesses were large for gas - rich galaxies with low @xmath0 band surface brightnesses and much smaller for gas - poor galaxies with higher @xmath0 band surface brightnesses , steepening the relationship between sfh and modified surface brightness considerably .",
    "thus , we may simply lack an adequate surface density range to be able to distinguish a steep trend in age with surface density , especially in the presence of significant uncertainties in the ages and surface densities . note that this is the interpretation that we prefer : the correlation between age and @xmath0 band surface brightness is quite tight , which is quite suggestive of some kind of correlation between density and sfh .",
    "note that the age ",
    "mass relation would survive in this case relatively unscathed : the dynamic range for the age ",
    "mass relation is in excess of 5 magnitudes , which makes it quite robust to changes @xmath8 1 mag in the relative positioning of the data points along the trend .",
    "all the above correlations are consistent with the proposition that _ the age of a lsbg stellar population is primarily correlated with its surface density and that its metallicity is correlated with both surface density and mass _ , albeit with considerable scatter .",
    "panels e , f , i and j of fig.[fig : correl ] all strongly support this scheme : in particular , lsbg giants have a range of @xmath0 band surface brightnesses ( and ages ; panel f ) but have bright @xmath0 band absolute magnitudes ( and high metallicities ; panel j ) .",
    "the main obstacle for such a scenario is the lack of correlation between modified @xmath0 band surface brightnesses and age and metallicity , which _ may _ be due to our explicit selection of galaxies with only a relatively narrow range of @xmath1 band central surface brightness .",
    "an important question to ask is if this scenario is physically plausible .",
    "a relationship between surface brightness / density and average age would be easy to understand : either a density dependent ( e.g.  schmidt 1959 ) star formation law or a star formation timescale which is proportional to the local dynamical timescale would result in such a correlation ( note that a magnitude  age correlation might suggest a global dynamical timescale dependence in the star formation law ; e.g.  kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "such a scenario would also very naturally account for the existence of age gradients in lsbgs : the outer regions of lsbgs are less dense , and would form stars less quickly than their inner regions , resulting in an age gradient .",
    "such a scheme is qualitatively consistent with those proposed by e.g.  de blok et al .  , jimenez et al .   or gerritsen & de blok .",
    "in these schemes , it is primarily the low surface density that slows down the evolution of lsbgs ( either explicitly through a density - dependent star formation law or implicitly , through an inability to build up a high gas metallicity ) .",
    "metallicity s mass dependence is likely to stem from the relative importance of feedback : the efficiency with which a galaxy ejects its metals in a supernova - driven wind is primarily driven by its mass @xcite .",
    "while the above scenario is consistent with the data , it is unlikely to be unique : because of the correlation between surface brightness and magnitude , a purely mass - dependent age and metallicity may be plausible .",
    "note , however that a mass - dependent age has some disadvantages : the ages of lsbg giants support a surface brightness dependent age , and age gradients would have to be explained using a different mechanism .",
    "we have performed deep imaging of a sample of 26 lsbgs in the optical and near - ir in order to study their stellar populations . by comparing their optical  near - ir colours with the latest stellar population models , it is possible to constrain the young to old star ratio ( parameterised by the average age of the galaxy ) and the galaxy metallicity .",
    "we have found the following .    *",
    "optical  near - ir colour gradients are common in lsbgs .",
    "most colour gradients are consistent with a mean stellar age gradient , with the outer regions of galaxies appearing younger than the inner region of galaxies .",
    "we argue against the effects of dust reddening as the only cause of lsbg colour gradients . as common as colour gradients are , they are not present in all lsbgs @xcite ; this is important , because it may provide a chance to directly observe what drives the age gradient in lsbgs . *",
    "we find that lsbgs have a wide range in morphologies and stellar populations , ranging from old , near solar metallicity populations for the very reddest lsbgs , to younger , high metallicity populations in the lsbg giants , to young and metal poor populations in the blue gas - rich lsbgs .",
    "* by comparing the observed optical  near - ir colours between 0.5 and 1.5 disc scale lengths with stellar population models , we have determined best - fit average ages and metallicities that are robust in a relative sense , so that trends in age and metallicity will be quite secure .",
    "* when the highly uncertain ages of the lowest metallicity galaxies are excluded , there are strong trends between both age and metallicity and @xmath0 band surface brightness , absolute magnitude and gas fraction .",
    "lsbgs with low @xmath0 band surface brightnesses , low @xmath0 luminosities and high gas fractions are all fairly unevolved , young , low metallicity systems .",
    "in contrast , lsbgs with higher @xmath0 band surface brightnesses , higher @xmath0 band luminosities and smaller gas fractions appear much more evolved , with older average ages and higher ( near solar ) metallicities .",
    "* we have constructed crude estimates of the total mass and total densities of the atomic hydrogen , helium and stars in lsbgs by turning the gas into stars with a constant @xmath0 band mass to light ratio of 0.6 @xmath76 .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the @xmath1 band absolute magnitudes and surface brightnesses are reasonable predictors of the mass and density estimators , to within a factor of @xmath8 60 per cent or so .",
    "we find that the ages and metallicities of lsbgs correlate well with our mass estimator , but correlate poorly with our surface density estimator .",
    "we argue that the poor correlation between our surface density estimator and sfh is the result of the narrow dynamic range in surface density probed by our sample , compounded by errors in sfh and density determination . *",
    "our results are consistent with a scenario in which the age of a lsbg is correlated primarily with its surface density , and the metallicity of a lsbg is correlated with both its surface density and mass ( albeit with much scatter ) .",
    "this kind of correlation would be observed if the star formation law depended either explicitly on gas surface density or on the local dynamical timescale , and if the efficiency with which a galaxy retained its newly - synthesised metal content was a function of its mass .",
