    "compelling arguments have been presented for the thermodynamic concept of negative temperature , an idealization and abstraction for systems with bounded energies @xcite .",
    "however , dunkel and hilbert ( dh ) @xcite and hilbert , hnggi , and dunkel ( hhd ) @xcite have recently argued that negative temperatures arise due to the use of the boltzmann entropy , which they claim to be inconsistent .",
    "instead , they suggest boltzmann s entropy should be replaced by one due to gibbs .",
    "the gibbs entropy is defined as the boltzmann constant times the logarithm of the total phase space volume less than a given energy .",
    "since the phase space volume is an increasing function of energy , the gibbs entropy only allows for positive temperatures .    for quantum systems with discrete energy levels",
    ", the boltzmann entropy corresponds to the logarithm of the degeneracy of an energy eigenstate ( or in a narrow energy interval ) , while the gibbs entropy is obtained by counting all the states less than or equal to a given energy @xcite . with this definition of entropy",
    ", temperature can not be negative as entropy is a nondecreasing function of energy . while the differences between the predictions of the gibbs and boltzmann entropies are unmeasurable for macroscopic systems with monotonic energy densities ( such as a system of harmonic oscillators ) , the differences are dramatic for systems with non - monotonic density of states .",
    "dh and hhd also applied their theory of thermodynamics to systems with very few degrees of freedom .",
    "we do not believe that thermodynamics is applicable to systems for which the relative fluctuations are large , so we will restrict our remarks to large systems .",
    "objections to dh s claims have been made by several authors @xcite . in this paper , we expand on these discussion to emphasize that it is appropriate to include negative temperature in thermodynamics , and to illustrate some incorrect predictions of gibbs entropy .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ thermo - entropy ] we briefly comment on the formulation of thermodynamics and entropy . a consistency condition is discussed in sec .",
    "[ condition ] , and we point out that such a condition has no constraint to the ising model . in sec .",
    "[ s - para ] , we discuss the entropy of a paramagnet .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ carnot ] , we discuss why an efficiency larger than one is possible for a carnot engine for inverted energy distributions , and that they are well described by negative temperatures .",
    "we then discuss the properties of adiabatic invariance in classical ( sec .",
    "[ adiabat - classical ] ) and quantum systems ( sec .  [ secqadiabaticinvarant ] ) and demonstrate that the number of states less than a given value of energy is not a true adiabatic invariant .",
    "we demonstrate with the examples of model systems that negative temperature does not lead to contradictions in sec .",
    "[ secising ] and [ sec - toy ] . in sec .",
    "[ one - degree ] we criticize the application of thermodynamics to systems with only a single one degree of freedom . in sec .",
    "[ sgproblem ] , a two - level model calculation shows that boltzmann temperature is decisively the correct temperature since it predicts the direction of heat transfer and is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "after briefly discussing ensemble equivalence ( sec .",
    "[ sec - ensemble - eq ] ) and the additivity of entropy ( sec .",
    "[ sec - additive ] ) , we discuss the concavity of the gibbs entropy ( sec .",
    "[ seccv ] ) and its violation of callen s postulates ( sec .  [ sec - postulate - ii ] ) for negative temperature states .",
    "we discuss the thermodynamics formulated in ref .",
    "[ sec - hhd - thermod ] ) and considering the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of splitting and joining of two systems ( sec .  [ sec - split - join ] ) .",
    "we remark on the non - monotonic dependence of temperature with energy for finite systems and why it disappears ( sec .",
    "[ sec - non - mono ] ) for large systems ( or in thermodynamic limit @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks in sec .",
    "[ sec - why ] and [ sec - final ] .",
    "dunkel and hilbert @xcite began with a statement that the positivity of absolute temperature is a key postulate of thermodynamics .",
    "dh cited callen ( postulate iii , page 28 , 2nd edition , @xcite ) that entropy ` is a monotonically increasing function of the energy . '",
    "they did not explain why they regard it as a key postulate .",
    "the only reason we know of is that monotonicity allows the equation @xmath2 to be inverted to give @xmath3 , from which the usual thermodynamic potentials can be obtained by legendre transforms .",
    "this is a matter of convenience , not principle , and massieu functions can produce the same results through legendre transforms of @xmath2 .",
    "apparently , dh rejected most of callen s other postulates of thermodynamics .",
    "the axiomatic formulation of thermodynamics , such as that given by giles @xcite , or lieb and yngvason @xcite , does not feature the concept of temperature until a very late stage . so the positivity of temperature is not at all a fundamental axiom of thermodynamics .",
    "even energy does not enter into the picture initially . what is fundamental in thermodynamics is the concept of irreversibility .",
    "this concept appears and is an emergent phenomenon only in the macroscopic world ; as is well - known , there is no irreversibility in microscopic physical laws .    whether one follows the traditional approach to thermodynamics @xcite , or the postulatory approach of gibbs , tisza , and callen , or the more precise axiomatic formulation in the post - modern era , they are all consistent and convergent to the same physical theory of thermodynamics .",
    "when we say `` thermodynamics '' , there should not be disagreement as what we mean by it .",
    "but since hilbert , hnggi , and dunkel ( hhd , @xcite ) proposal of a thermodynamics is substantially different from the usual formulation , we need to examine its legitimacy .",
    "it is possible to develop statistical mechanics in exactly the same way as in the traditional thermodynamics , where an empirical temperature occupies a prominent place in defining isothermal processes . with the help of the carnot cycle",
    ", we can define absolute temperature , and thus , following clausius , entropy .",
    "this chain of reasoning puts entropy at the last , so the dispute over which expression is the correct entropy can be , hopefully , resolved .",
    "we give some details with such an approach here .",
    "of course , the final result is exactly the same as the standard textbook statistical mechanics with boltzmann entropy .",
    "dh and hhd have argued that negative temperature states are unstable or unphysical ; any contact with a positive temperature environment will collapse the system @xcite .",
    "there seems to be a misunderstanding of thermodynamic stability .",
    "any thermal contact of any system with another system at a different temperature takes it through an irreversible process into a different equilibrium state .",
    "if a system at negative temperature is brought into contact with another system at negative temperature , the final equilibrium will be at an intermediate tempearature that is also negative .",
    "the states are stable if the entropy associated with the system is a concave function of energy . if a negative temperature system is in contact with a system of the same negative temperature , it will happily coexist .",
    "we choose a notation that is largely consistent with that of dh .",
    "the total number of states below energy @xmath4 is @xmath5 for simplicity , we ll consider mostly quantum systems with a set of discrete energy eigen spectra , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , 2 , @xmath8 . and @xmath9 . the gibbs ( volume ) entropy is @xmath10 , and boltzmann , @xmath11 .",
    "the small energy @xmath12 is used to specify an energy range of microcanonical ensemble of the system .",
    "we define @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we had always thought that the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath16 was so small for a macroscopic system that it would be impossible to detect , which would imply that the choice might be a matter of taste to some extent .",
    "this is true for systems of particles with unbounded energies .",
    "now it appears that dh have ( inadvertently ) provided a demonstration that @xmath16 is not tenable .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the definition of entropy , entropy of macroscopic observables , is based on the joint probability distribution for large , but finite systems . in this particular case , it is equivalent to what dh labelled as @xmath15 , although the additive constant is expressed differently than their @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , by construction , the maximum of the sum of the entropies occurs at the maximum probability of a subsystem energy after the two subsystems have come to thermal equilibrium .",
    "this means that  if they insist on taking the small differences seriously ",
    "the maximum of their sum of entropies occurs at a non - equilibrium value of the energy of the subsystems , see sec .",
    "[ secntest ] . if they were to give initial conditions such that the two subsystems started at the maximum of their total entropy , releasing the constraint ( allowing heat transfer ) , then splitting again would lower the entropy , in violation of the second law @xcite .",
    "we would certainly agree with the importance of dh s eq.(4 ) , but it would be more appropriate to write it as @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 the volume @xmath21 should be included in the @xmath22 s",
    ". it would not be an appropriate variable for most systems with bounded energy .",
    "for classical hamiltonian systems , the argument that @xmath23 seems unfounded because the difference is of the order of @xmath24 , such as for ideal gas , while fluctuations are of the order @xmath25 . if fluctuations are negligible , which is usually assumed in thermodynamics , then @xmath26 is negligible .    the consistency issues have been addressed in the past .",
    "boltzmann himself discussed it in what boltzmann called ` heat theorems ' , asking questions of consistency with thermodynamics ( see appendix 9a1 of gallavotti s textbook @xcite ; see also the discussion in s .- k .",
    "ma , chap .",
    "23 @xcite ) .",
    "it is not essential that @xmath16 satisfies the condition for all @xmath27 , but for none with @xmath15 , since thermodynamics is well - defined only in the limit @xmath28 . and in that limit , it does satisfy ( frenkel and warren @xcite ) , so nothing is violated .    a key feature of the consistent condition , eq .  ( 6 ) in dh which we write down again here ,",
    "@xmath29 which the authors do not seem to notice is that when it applies to , say , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) ferromagnetic ising model , @xmath30 it just produces a `` null statement '' , as there is no @xmath31-variable to use to form the equation .",
    "the thermodynamic equation is simply @xmath32 .",
    "alternatively , one can use the coupling @xmath33 as one of the external control thermodynamic variable , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "then the consistency condition only produces an identity , @xmath35 , for any reasonable expression of @xmath36 .",
    "this is because the @xmath36-dependence gets cancelled between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , since @xmath39 .",
    "the consistency condition has no use to judge which entropy expression is correct , at least for the ising chain . in sec .",
    "[ seccampisi ] below , we also show that the consistent condition is violated for a paramagnet if gibbs volume entropy is used . extending the adiabatic invariant and consistency properties of gibbs volume entropy , valid for classical hamiltonian systems with continuous energy spectra , to all systems",
    ", seems to us an over - generalization , and need further justification .",
    "which of the alternative starting points of definitions for entropy is correct ?",
    "we address this question in a different perspective . instead of taking a postulatory approach to the expression for entropy , we derive it , following the classical approach to thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "this consists of the following steps : 0 ) fundamental to statistical mechanics is the equal - a - priori probability and microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this will be our basis in the following consideration . in order to reproduce thermodynamics from statistical mechanics ,",
    "we work in the thermodynamic limit ( i.e. , large system sizes ) .",
    "1 ) build an empirical thermometer to realize the zeroth law of thermodynamics .",
    "2 ) use the thermometer to determine the equation of state and thus adiabatic and isothermal processes .",
    "3 ) build carnot cycles to find the universal function relating the empirical temperature to the kelvin scale .",
    "4 ) define the entropy according to clausius .",
    "this chain of reasoning puts entropy at the last as an output of the more mechanical arguments , instead of starting with the entropy postulates . as a by - product , the concept of negative temperature results naturally from the derivative of entropy with respect to energy , if steps 1 ) to 4 ) are not erroneous . to do this in a very general",
    "setting is obviously difficult .",
    "here we are modest , considering only the simplest possible model systems .",
    "in particular , we take a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ising model as our bath or thermometer , and a non - interaction paramagnet as the system ( see also frenkel and warren , ref .  ) .",
    "our logical conclusion is that the usual textbook entropy formula is sound and implies the existence of negative absolute temperature for systems with bounded energy .",
    "we assume that the dynamics is such that energy is conserved .",
    "the probability distribution function ( for classical systems ) or density matrices ( for the quantum case ) follows the liouville or von neumann equation .",
    "however , our ising model does not have an intrinsic dynamics ; we assume that the system follows some form of stochastic dynamics governed by a master equation ( penrose @xcite ) .",
    "we do not need to explicitly specify the dynamics as we are not interested in the actual time - dependent processes , in other words , we work in the domain of equilibrium statistical mechanics and quasi - static processes .",
    "the only thing that is required is that the system evolves in such a way that micro - states with the same energy ( or other conserved quantities , e.g. , magnetization ) will have the same probability , i.e. , the microcanonical assumption .",
    "another point is that we will work in large size limit ( i.e. , thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "systems with few degrees of freedom in isolation belong to the regime of mechanics and can not possibly behave like a thermodynamic system ( e.g. , can not thermalize ) .",
    "this helps in simplification of our derivations .",
    "we consider a 1d ising chain with a periodic boundary condition without a magnetic field term , with the hamiltonian function given by @xmath40 the super-/subscript @xmath41 indicates the degrees of freedom of the bath ( or thermometer ) in contrast to the system without the sub- or superscripts . since we work in microcanonical ensemble , the ( statistical mechanical ) system is uniquely characterized by the total energy @xmath42 and number of spin @xmath43 .",
    "now we define an empirical temperature @xmath44 .",
    "the average @xmath45 is with respect to the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "it is clear that @xmath46 .",
    "we note that @xmath47 , so our thermometer readings are real numbers from @xmath48 to 1 , with negative values corresponding to the usual negative temperature .",
    "as we ll see later , this temperature scale @xmath49 is essentially @xmath50 mapped to a bounded interval . unlike the ideal gas thermometer , our ising thermometer can measure both positive as well as negative temperatures .",
    "we build a carnot engine made of an ising paramagnet , given by the hamiltonian @xmath51 let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be the number of spins with plus and minus signs , respectively , then the energy is @xmath54 , and the total magnetization is @xmath55 . a thermodynamic state is uniquely specified by the energy @xmath4 and the magnetic field @xmath56 , while one of the equation of state ( magnetization ) is @xmath57 . in a microcanonical ensemble energy",
    "does not fluctuate . by the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath58",
    ", we can identify the heat and work as @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the work is related to the part of internal energy changeable by the control parameter @xmath56 . from the above",
    ", we note that adiabatic lines are very simple , given by @xmath61 .",
    " horizontal lines in an @xmath62 v.s .",
    "@xmath56 diagram ( see sec .  [ secqadiabaticinvarant ] for further justification )",
    ". however , the isothermal curves are more difficult to specify , as we do not have a real equation of state relating to the ( empirical ) temperature yet .",
    "to find the empirical temperature of the paramagnetic system , we take initially two separate systems of the thermometer , characterized by the total energy @xmath42 , and the system , characterized by @xmath4 and @xmath56 ( the sizes @xmath43 and @xmath27 are also parameters , but they are considered as fixed constants ) .",
    "we then combine them into a new system with the hamiltonian @xmath63 .",
    "as there is no explicit interaction term between the two subsystems in the hamiltonian and the dynamics is such that it makes @xmath64 microcanonical , the effect of combining them is to make each subsystem no longer in microcanonical distribution but new marginal distributions dictated by the overall microcanical distribution .",
    "we now ask what the expectation value @xmath65 is .",
    "if this value is the same as before making the contact , @xmath49 , then we say that the system is at the empirical temperature @xmath49 .",
    "this defines the self - consistent condition for the temperature of the paramagnetic system @xmath66 this is an equation for @xmath49 as the right - hand side also contains @xmath49 due to @xmath46 .",
    "the result will depend on @xmath4 and @xmath56 in the constraints .",
    "the equation can be made more explicit as @xmath67 where the ` density of states ' ( number of microscopic states at energy @xmath68 , @xmath69 even ) of the 1d ising is @xmath70 we assume @xmath43 even for simplicity .",
    "@xmath69 denotes the number of plus - minus boundaries in a 1d ising configuration .",
    "similarly , the density of states of the paramagnet is @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",

    ". then the summation is dominated by the largest weight , @xmath75 .",
    "we find the value @xmath69 for which the weight is a maximum .",
    "although @xmath69 and @xmath52 or @xmath53 are integers , in the large size limit , we can treat them as real numbers . using the stirling approximation , @xmath76 , for @xmath77 sufficiently large , and obtaining the derivative of @xmath78 with respect to @xmath69 and setting it to 0",

    "@xmath88 is a derived concept , characterizing , in an alternative way , the temperature of the system or bath .",

    "an example is given in figure  [ figparamagnet ] .",
    "the two adiabatic curves are characterized by @xmath90 and @xmath91 as horizontal lines .",
    "the isothermal curves are labeled by @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( or equivalently @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "they are given by the equation of state for the paramagnet as @xmath96 an important point is that these family of isothermal curves are identical no matter what empirical temperature scale one uses , thus independent of the temperature measuring devices .",
    "hence , the concept of ` temperature ' is just a one - parameter family of real numbers labeling these curves .",
    "positivity of the temperature is not required .",
    "as in the usual construction of the kelvin temperature scale , we compute the heat absorbed at the high temperature , @xmath97 at @xmath92 , and heat released at low temperature , @xmath98 at @xmath93 with the total work , @xmath99 , done by the system as the area of the loop running clockwise on the cycle .",
    "high and low temperatures are defined according to second law of thermodynamics ( not the actually values of the parameter @xmath49 ) - heat flows from high temperature to low temperature if there is no external intervention .",
    "then , @xmath100 our job is to find the function @xmath101 , that depends on our choice of the empirical temperatures , but if we define @xmath102 , then this new temperature scale , @xmath37 , the kelvin scale , clearly is independent of the makeup of the thermometer and is universal in the sense that all carnot cycles have exactly the same efficiency formula @xmath103 if temperatures are the same on the kelvin scale .",
    "thus , the kelvin scale is a privileged one over the empirical ones .",

    "we also dropped an arbitrary integration constant .",

    "an important observation is that @xmath36 does not depend on @xmath56 explicitly and only on @xmath62 , which is consistent with the fact that the adiabatic lines are @xmath107 .",

    "there is no numerical relation of the entropy of the combined system @xmath335 with that of separated systems 1 and 2 , uncoupled .",
    "one can not analyze the efficiency of a carnot engine , as the formulation does not have provision for the thermal coupling / decoupling of the system and the baths .    the way to try to understand why thermodynamics has to be formulated in such a way",
    "is that the authors trying to fit the bill of gibbs @xmath16 .",
    "the gibbs entropy does satisfy all the properties listed above @xcite .",
    "the ` thermodynamic laws ' are invented to ` check ' that @xmath16 satisfies them . clearly , the argument is logically circular ; and that @xmath16 satisfies the thermodynamic laws is a misleading claim",
    ".    one may argue that we are misrepresenting things , as the above formulation is for isolated systems .",
    "even so , why it is useful at all ?",
    "we give an analysis as what happen if we couple and decouple two identical equilibrium systems , from statistical mechanics point of view and see if entropy increase or decrease .",
    "\\a ) consider two identical boxes of ideal gases of macroscopic sizes with exactly the same macroscopic measurable properties , i.e. , the same thermodynamic state . if there is a partition separating them that can be open or closed , does the total entropy change ?",
    "of course not , according to the usual thermodynamics .",
    "in fact this is one of the fundamental axiom in lieb - yngvason s formulation of thermodynamics ( ref .",
    ", page 21 , axiom ( a5 ) , splitting and recombination ) .",
    "the entropy of macroscopic observables does give zero entropy change by definition @xcite .",
    "this contradicts the hhd second law .",
    "\\b ) now we consider systems as small statistical mechanical systems described by either a classical hamiltonian dynamics or quantum dynamics for the distributions , @xmath166 .",
    "open or closing of a partition can be modeled by a time - dependent external potential .",
    "first of all , if we start with a product of microcanical distributions , @xmath360 , of two separate systems ( let s call it statistical - mechanical state @xmath117 ) , it is not possible to evolve into a new microcanonical distribution of combined system ( call it @xmath133 ) , simply liouville s theorem prevents the value of probability @xmath166 to be changed along the dynamic trajectory . also when separating the system , it is also not possible to evolved back to a product state , @xmath117 .",
    "the von neumann entropy is a constant in any events .",
    "so the question about entropy increase or decrease can not be answered in such a framework .    in order to have a boltzmann - like h - theorem ,",
    "one need to use a coarse - grained description @xcite , which essentially lead to :    \\c ) a third option , a stochastic dynamics of markov chain . in this framework",
    "the problem is well - posed .",
    "in such a description , we can make transitions from @xmath117 to @xmath133 dynamically which lead to an entropy increase .",
    "still @xmath133 to @xmath117 is not possible .",
    "if we start from the combined system @xmath133 in a microcanonical distribution , the probability distribution ends up to a distribution of energy partitions of the product microcanonical distributions , let us call this state @xmath361 , the decoupled but still entangled state , so @xmath362 .    to think of this with a concrete example , we can still take the paramagnet or equivalently the two - level system , with energy @xmath324 in the excited state and 0 for the ground for each particle . to give a meaning to spatial locality and partition",
    ", we imagine that the spins / particles form a 1d chain .",
    "the dynamics is simply to pick two nearest neighbor particles at random and swap the locations .",
    "this is an energy ( and magnetization ) conserving process .",
    "let us consider two identical systems with @xmath27 particles each and one excited particle each with total energy @xmath363 .",
    "the entropy increases when two systems are combined are , @xmath364 , and @xmath365 $ ] , respectively . for both definitions of entropy ,",
    "the increase approaches @xmath366 for sufficiently large @xmath27 .",
    "if we split the system from state @xmath133 by adding partition , it evolves towards @xmath361 .",
    "it is not clear at all how to quantify the entropy .",
    "we give four possibilities : ( i ) we know exactly what the energies are of each subsystems  such is the case if we simulate the process on computer , and check exactly how many excited particles are in one of the partitions",
    ". then total entropy decreases .",
    "( ii ) if we are not allowed to measure the energy or our measurement is not precise , the total entropy still decreases .",
    "for example , the total entropy may be defined by @xmath367 , where @xmath368 is the probability that subsystem 1 get an energy @xmath369 which can be calculated from the initial microcanonical distribution of system @xmath133 .",
    "then , ( iii ) , we can apply the shannon entropy , @xmath370 , over the whole state space . since the probability of a particular microscopic configuration is the probability @xmath368 of getting split into energy @xmath369 , times the probability in a particular microscopic state of the joint system , which is equal probable in each subsystem ,",
    "we can write , @xmath371 this is higher comparing to case ( ii ) by an amount due to the random selection of energies .",
    "for the two particles in a 1d box of size @xmath372 problem , one finds that @xmath373 ( this is a general result ) , and @xmath374 , i.e. , entropy does not change if boltzmann entropy for state @xmath133 is used and entropy still decreases if gibbs entropy is used .",
    "curiously , @xmath133 to @xmath361 is a reversible process or recoverable - removing the parition will make the system back to @xmath133 , so entropy does not change make good sense .",
    "( iv ) in the last case we can consider the expression given by @xcite @xmath375 , where @xmath376 is the energy of the system in micro - state @xmath69 with probability @xmath377 . with the microcanonical constraint , all states have the same energy , so it is a constant with the value @xmath378 ; entropy does not change .",
    "unfortunately , it is a constant no matter what initial distributions to begin with .",
    "so , it can not describe relaxation towards equilibrium .    to conclude , if we believe that the opening or closing a partition is an adiabatic process ( possibly performing work but no heat exchange ) , then entropy must not decrease .",
    "cases ( i)-(iv ) show that gibbs entropy contradicts planck s formulation of the second law , or at least , gibbs entropy can not make any definite statement as it is not properly defined for state @xmath361 .",
    "the fact that we can not have unambiguous interpretation of entropy in a state @xmath361 only demonstrates that thermodynamic entropy is a macroscopic concept .",
    "the contradictions and ambiguity disappear for large systems .",
    "hhd cited reasons not to use temperature @xmath264 or @xmath242 to judge if heat can flow from one body to another or not . both of them fail to do so for tiny systems .",
    "the reason for this failure is because they insists that thermodynamics works for any size @xmath27 . if one consider only thermodynamic limit result ( in the sense of omitting any contributions smaller than @xmath27 for extensive quantities such as energy and entropy , and omitting quantities of order @xmath24 or @xmath379 for intensive quantities such as temperature ) , thermodynamics works just fine .",
    "both zeroth and second law can be satisfied which define the thermodynamic system .",
    "the internal energy @xmath4 is a monotonic function of @xmath380 for large systems , so increasing temperature always lead to an increase of the internal energy .",
    "this can be seen easily in the canonical ensemble , since in the canonical ensemble the heat capacity measures the fluctuation of the energy , @xmath381,\\ ] ] which is always positive , and one can verify that the heat capacity is always a positive quantity , even for the negative boltzmann temperature states .",
    "by postulate @xmath16 as the thermodynamic entropy , we got 1 ) positivity of @xmath37 ( but why this is important ) , 2 ) concavity and super - additivity of @xmath16 .",
    "but breaks many things : 1 ) ensembles no longer equivalent , even for a paramagnet , 2 ) temperatures of individual systems and combined system are not the same , and violating the usual 0-th law of thermodynamics .",
    "3 ) violation of callen s postulate ii .",
    "4 ) meaningless thermodynamics when @xmath224 , which are @xmath382 , @xmath383 , heat capacity @xmath384 .",
    "one can not write down a meaningful thermodynamic relation as it is @xmath385 .",
    "5 ) thermodynamics losses its predicting power in the sense of callen s postulate ii since @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "in addition , when applied to single quantum degree systems ( we believe one can not do that for both @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , one violates 6 ) third law of thermodynamics .",
    "hhd s deduction has a logic fallacy : thermodynamic entropy must satisfy zeroth , first , and second law .",
    "gibbs volume entropy does not satisfy hhd s version of zeroth law ( average temperatures of subsystems when in thermal contact equal the temperature as a whole ) , when energy of the system is bounded .",
    "therefore , there is no logical implication that thermodynamic temperature can not be negative .",
    "if canonical ensemble were used to treat the harmonic oscillator , an explicit thermodynamic limit is not necessary as the free energy is already a homogeneous function of particle number even for one and two particles .",
    "it is clear we are already in the``thermodynamic limit '' ; the specific one calculated for one particle in a canonical ensemble is just one of the many .",
    "however , in the microcanonical ensemble , situation is different and taking the limit is a necessary step in order to have an entropy expression that is consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "the author thanks robert h. swendsen for many useful exchanges and even contributions to some of the passages in this critique . but the opinions are the author only .",
    "he also thanks peter hnggi for an inspiring talk , although we disagree on most of the issues discussed here .",
    "finally , i sincerely apologize to both of them that this work has caused unnecessary damage on an emotional level and damage to our long - lasting friendship .",
    "each one of us holds stubbornly a view unreconcilable with the other , which may be a good thing for physics .",
    "we can interpret the change of density matrix @xmath202 in three ways , 1 ) quantum dynamics of the von neumann equation with finite speed , 2 ) infinite slow adiabatic change such that the state remains in the instantaneous eigen state of @xmath387 , 3 ) thermalization in each step of the way with equilibrium @xmath388 .",
    "fortunately , for the present problem , they all give the same adiabats , @xmath211 . particularly noteworthy",
    "is that at the point @xmath389 , the system can not be in thermal equilibrium , but it does not matter - there is no heat entering or leaving the system , or generated internally , as long as we do not stop at @xmath390 ; thus the process can not be quasi - static but still is adiabatic .",
    "alternative view ( penrose ) : since @xmath62 is a conserved quantity , the microcanonical ensemble should be characterized by both @xmath4 and @xmath62 .",
    "then quasi - static process is also possible passing the point @xmath389 .",
    "dh derived @xmath264 in the following way .",
    "consider a quantum system with energy eigenvalues @xmath181 , @xmath391 , such that @xmath392 is the ground state .",
    "then , by identifying @xmath4 with @xmath181 and @xmath130 with @xmath183 , we get @xmath393 . for harmonic oscillator , @xmath394 , and for a particle in a box , @xmath395 , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : socillatort ] ) for the oscillator and @xmath396 for a particle in a box .",
    "these results violated third law of thermodynamics ",
    "temperature is not zero when entropy is zero .",
    "another example will be more instructive : consider a bounded 1d potential such that the energy spectrum is hydrogen - like , @xmath397 , @xmath398 .",
    "then @xmath399 .",
    "we obtain this result that the ground state is hotter than the excited states .",
