    "recent observations of long - lived beating phenomena in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic spectra @xcite of photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes have stimulated a considerable increase in activity in the interdisciplinary field of molecular science and quantum physics .",
    "@xcite it has generally been assumed that electronic coherence decays sufficiently rapidly that it does not affect the nature of electronic energy transfer in photosynthetic light harvesting systems .",
    "nevertheless , these recent experiments have attributed long - lived quantum beats to an electronic origin . initially , 2d electronic spectroscopic experiments were conducted for fenna - mathews - olson ( fmo ) pigment - protein complexes isolated from green sulfur bacteria at a cryogenic temperature , 77k , @xcite and revealed the presence of quantum beats persisting for a minimum of 660fs .",
    "@xcite however , it is generally thought that coherence at physiological temperatures is fragile compared to that at cryogenic temperatures , because environmental fluctuation amplitudes increase with increasing temperature . to clarify this issue , electronic coherence lifetimes in the fmo complex",
    "were theoretically examined , and it was predicted that electronic coherence in this complex could persist for 700 and 300fs at 77 and 300k , respectively .",
    "@xcite these theoretical predictions were consistent with newer experimental results at physiological temperatures for the fmo complex .",
    "@xcite however , panitchayangkoon _",
    "et al._@xcite demonstrated that quantum beats in this complex persist for 1.5 ps at cryogenic temperatures , although the theoretical model does not produce electronic coherence with this lifetime .",
    "hence , nuclear vibrational contribution signatures in 2d spectroscopy have attracted considerable interest of late , in particular as regards interpretations of the oscillatory transients observed in light - harvesting complexes , which persist for significantly longer than the predicted electronic dephasing times .",
    "several independent publications have alluded to nuclear vibrational effects as an explanation for this long - lived beating behavior .",
    "@xcite    in photosynthetic pigment - protein complexes , the huang - rhys factors of chlorophyll ( chl ) and bacteriochlorophyll ( bchl ) are generally thought to be small , @xcite suggesting that the photophysics therein is primarily electronic in nature , rather than vibrational .",
    "indeed , the recent 2d electronic experiments on bchl molecules in solution did not find significant vibrational coherence.@xcite in relation to this , christensson _",
    "@xcite proposed that resonance between electronic states and active franck - condon vibrational states serves to create vibronic excitons , i.e. , quantum mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states .",
    "such states have vibrational characteristics and enhanced transition dipole moments owing to intensity borrowing from the strong electronic transitions .",
    "hence , it was suggested that coherent excitation of the vibronic excitons produces oscillations in the 2d signal that exhibit picosecond dephasing times .",
    "tiwari , peters , and jonas @xcite commented that the excitonically mixed electronic and vibrational states also lead to an enhancement of the vibrational coherence excitation in the electronic ground state .",
    "it was also argued that this effect could explain the long - lived oscillations in the fmo complex . regarding electronic energy transfer dynamics , womick and",
    "moran @xcite demonstrated that a vibrational - electronic resonance enhances the energy transfer rate in a cyanobacterial light - harvesting protein , allophycocyanin , with the use of the vibronic exciton model .",
    "quantum mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states , or vibronic excitons , are plausible as an explanation for long - lived spectral beating in 2d electronic spectra",
    ". however , a question naturally arises concerning the interplay between the electronic - vibrational resonance and electronic energy fluctuations induced by the environmental dynamics .",
    "@xcite in general , the energy eigenstates due to the quantum mixing of electronic and vibronic excitations are obtained via diagonalization of the hamiltonian comprising the franck - condon transition energies and electronic interactions .",
    "it should be noted that these are independent of any environmental factors such as temperature , reorganization energy , and fluctuations .",
    "ishizaki and fleming @xcite characterized the impact of environmental factors upon the quantum delocalization using the concurrence .",
    "@xcite they visually demonstrated that smaller electronic coupling , larger reorganization energy , and higher temperature cause the dynamic localization,@xcite even in the case in which two electronic states resonate in a coupled homo - dimer .",
    "recently , ishizaki @xcite explored the influence of environmentally induced fluctuation timescales on the quantum mixing between electron donor and acceptor states in a model photo - induced electron transfer reaction .",
    "it was demonstrated that fast fluctuation and correspondingly fast solvation eradicates the quantum mixing between the donor and acceptor in the vicinity of the crossing point of the diabatic free energy surfaces , leading to a marcus - type nonadiabatic reaction , whereas slow fluctuation sustains the quantum mixing and prompts the electron transfer reaction in an adiabatic fashion .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is natural to question whether the nature of the quantum mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states is altered through dynamic interactions with the environment .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of environmentally induced fluctuations upon the quantum mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states in a simple electronic energy transfer system through electronic energy transfer dynamics and 2d electronic spectra calculations .",
    "the electronic energy transfer system used here is a coupled hetero - dimer , modeled on bchl 3 and 4 in the fmo protein .",
    "further , we investigate the extent to which vibrational modes play a role in electronic energy transfer dynamics under the influence of the environmentally induced fluctuations .",
    "to clarify the impact of the protein - induced dynamic fluctuations upon quantum mechanically mixed electronic - electronic and electronic - vibrational states in a systematic fashion , we consider the simplest electronic energy transfer system , a coupled hetero - dimer . to describe electronic energy transfer ( eet ) , we restrict the electronic spectra of the @xmath0-th pigment in a pigment - protein complex ( ppc ) to the ground state , @xmath1 , and the first excited state , @xmath2 ,",
    "although higher excited states are sometimes of consequence in nonlinear spectroscopic signals.@xcite thus , the model hamiltonian of a pigment - protein complex comprising two pigments is expressed as @xmath3 here , @xmath4 represents the diabatic hamiltonian for the environmental and nuclear degrees of freedom ( dofs ) , @xmath5 , when the system is in the @xmath6 state for @xmath7 . the electronic coupling between the pigments , @xmath8 ,",
    "may also be modulated by the environmental and nuclear dofs . in the following , however , we assume that the nuclear dependence of @xmath8 is vanishingly small and employ the condon - like approximation as usual .",
    "the franck - condon transition energy of the @xmath0-th pigment is obtained as @xmath9 where the canonical average has been introduced , @xmath10 with the canonical distribution , @xmath11 . here , @xmath12 is the inverse temperature , @xmath13 .",
    "the electronic energy of each diabatic state experiences fluctuations caused by the environmental and nuclear dynamics ; these dynamics are described by the collective energy gap coordinate , such that @xmath14 by definition , _ the coordinate , @xmath15 , includes information associated not only with the electronic excited state , but also the electronic ground state .",
    "_ in this work , we assume that the environmentally induced fluctuations can be described as gaussian processes and that the relevant nuclear dynamics are harmonic vibrations . under this assumption ,",
    "the dynamic properties of the environmental and intramolecular vibrations are characterized by several types of two - body correlation functions of @xmath16 , as shown below .",
    "the environmental dynamics and intramolecular vibrational motion affecting the electronic transitions can be characterized by the nonequilibrium energy difference between the electronic ground and excited states as a function of a delay time , @xmath17 , after the photoexcitation.@xcite the linear response theory allows one to express the nonequilibrium energy difference as @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the relaxation function @xcite defined as @xmath20 in terms of the response function of @xmath21 , @xmath22 \\right\\rangle_{mg}$ ] .",
    "the relaxation function is independent of temperature , and the value of @xmath23 gives the stokes shift magnitude.@xcite under the assumption of gaussian fluctuation and harmonic vibration , the stokes shift is given as double the total reorganization energy and , hence , the relaxation function satisfies @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the environmental and vibrational reorganization energies of the @xmath0-th pigment , respectively .",
    "the spectral density , @xmath27 , is defined as the imaginary component of the susceptibility@xcite and , hence , it is expressed in terms of @xmath19 as @xmath28 the fluctuations in the electronic transition energies are described by the symmetrized correlation function of @xmath21 , defined as @xmath29 . in the quantum mechanical treatment ,",
    "the fourier transform of the symmetrized correlation function is expressed with that of the relaxation function , @xcite specifically , @xmath30 = ( \\hbar\\omega/2)\\coth(\\beta\\hbar\\omega/2 ) \\psi_m[\\omega]$ ] . in the classical limit of @xmath31 , therefore , the correlation function of the fluctuations can be expressed in terms of @xmath19 as @xmath32 equations   and suggest that the relaxation function , @xmath19 , may be the key component for characterizing the relevant environmental dynamics and intramolecular vibrational motion .    the relaxation function can be separated into two components : an overdamped part originating from the environmental reorganization and an underdamped part induced by the intramolecular vibrations , i.e. , @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in order to focus on the timescale of the environmental dynamics affecting the electronic transition energies , we model the environmental component as an exponential decay form , with @xmath36 where @xmath37 corresponds to the timescale of the environmental reorganization dynamics . here , it should be noted that the initial behavior of eq .   is coarse grained , as was commented in ref .  .",
    "specifically , the value of @xmath38 should vanish by definition .",
    "however , as long as finite timescales of the environmental dynamics are discussed , this coarse - grained nature of the exponential decay form does not cause fatal defects . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a single intramolecular vibration on each of the pigments , with frequency , @xmath39 , and the huang - rhys factor , @xmath40 .",
    "we model the relaxation function originating from the vibration , @xmath41 , using the brownian oscillator model @xcite with the vibrational relaxation rate , @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 have been introduced .",

    "an adequate description of the eet dynamics is given by the reduced density operator , @xmath48 , that is , the partial trace of the total ppc density operator , @xmath49 , over the environmental and nuclear dofs : @xmath50 .",
    "the gaussian nature of the electronic excitation energy fluctuations , @xmath15 , allows a formally exact equation of motion to be obtained , that can describe the eet dynamics under the influence of the environmentally induced fluctuation and dissipation .",
    "the nature of these factors is described by eq .  - .",
    "hence , the eet dynamics under the influence of the environmental / nuclear dynamics and the corresponding 2d electronic spectra can be described in a numerically accurate manner .",
    "the technical details of this calculation are given in appendix  [ appendix - eom ] and appendix  [ appendix - nr - response ] .",
    "in general , vibronic exciton states are introduced as energy eigenstates of the vibronic hamiltonian , which are independent of any environmental factors such as temperature and fluctuations .",
    "however , the correlation function approach in this work does not treat mixed electronic - vibrational states as the energy eigenstates , allowing us to describe the influence of environmentally induced fluctuations on the electronic - vibrational quantum mixture .",
    "the validity of employing the correlation functions to describe the quantum superposition between the electronic and vibronic transitions is demonstrated in appendix  [ validity - of - theory ] .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the numerical results , in order to quantify the impact of the environment upon the quantum mechanically mixed electronic and vibrational states on the eet dynamics and 2d electronic spectra of a model dimer .",
    "we focus on a dimer which produces little beating of electronic origin in the absence of vibronic contributions .",
    "the studied dimer is inspired by bchl 3 and 4 ( pigments 1 and 2 , respectively ) in the fmo protein of _ chlorobaculum tepidum _ ,",
    "@xcite which serve as the two lowest energy exciton states in the single - excitation manifold .",
    "the low - frequency vibrational modes of bchl in solutions or protein environments have been investigated in a number of experiments , demonstrating that the strongest vibrational mode is found at approximately @xmath51.@xcite thus , to describe the effects of the franck - condon active vibrational modes , we consider a single vibrational mode with frequency @xmath52 in this work . for the sake of simplicity , the franck - condon transition energy of each pigment and their electronic coupling are set to @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : pop - dynamics - env ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : pop - dynamics - noenv ] , one recognizes that the short - term behaviors ( @xmath82 ) arise from electronically coherent motion between the electronic transition of pigment 1 and the @xmath75 vibronic transition of pigment 2 , and the subsequent hopping dynamics follow . as demonstrated in ref .",
    ", the electronic excitation is delocalized just after the photoexcitation even in the incoherent hopping regime .",
    "as time progresses , the dissipation of reorganization energy proceeds and the excitation becomes localized .",
    "the vibrational modes contribute to acceleration of the eet , albeit only slightly , because the vibronic resonance adds a new eet channel in comparison with the case without the vibrational mode .",
    "however , the overall behaviors of the eet dynamics are dominated by the environment , and the contribution of the vibrational modes decreases with increasing temperature . as can be seen in eqs .   and , the root mean squared amplitude of the environmentally induced fluctuations in the electronic energy is given as @xmath83 , which is evaluated as @xmath84 and @xmath85 at temperatures of 77 and 300k , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the inter - site coupling constant inducing the vibronic resonance is evaluated as @xmath86 for @xmath58 .",
    "hence , the inter - site coupling causing the vibronic resonance is one order of magnitude smaller than the fluctuation amplitudes and , therefore , the vibronic resonance does not play a significant role in the eet dynamics under the influence of the environmentally induced fluctuations .      in this subsection",

    "to clarify the origins of the beatings in fig .",
    "[ fig : full2dnr - diagonal]d , we decompose the nonrephasing 2d spectra to the stimulated emission ( se ) , ground state bleaching ( gsb ) , and excited state absorption ( esa ) contributions .",

    "the present observation corroborates the recent theoretical argument by plenio , almeida , and huelga,@xcite which suggested that the se , gsb , and esa contributions in the rephasing 2d spectra could be of the same order in realistic parameter ranges with the use of a simplified markovian quantum master equation .    in order to clarify the extent to which the quantum mixture between the electronic transition of pigment 1 and the vibronic transitions of pigment 2 contributes to the observed beating in the nonrephasing 2d spectra",
    ", we explore the effects of the environmentally induced fluctuations on beating amplitude . for this purpose , we address beating in the gsb pathways , that is , the vibrational coherence between @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the electronic ground state .",
    "this is because the gsb pathway is unaffected by the energy transfer processes in the single - excitation manifold and , thus , it allows one to investigate interplays between the quantum mixture and the environmentally induced fluctuations .",
    "the beating amplitudes in the gsb contribution observed in the nonrephasing 2d spectra are determined as being the difference between the first and second extremal values after @xmath96 , as indicated by the dashed - line box in fig .",

    "firstly , a local maximum of the beating amplitude is observed at the dp1 position ( @xmath97 ) , independently of the vibrational frequency .",
    "this beating is caused by the ground state vibrational coherence created via the lower exciton , @xmath91 , that is , through the liouville pathway of @xmath98 .",
    "secondly , another local maximum is found at various locations in the vicinity of dp2 ( @xmath99 ) , depending on the vibrational frequency .",
    "this beating originates from the ground state vibrational coherence created via the upper vibronic excitons , @xmath92 , that is , through the liouville pathways of @xmath100 .",
    "the transition energy of the vibronic excitons , @xmath92 , differs according to the vibrational frequency and , hence , the location of the beating amplitude maxima vary",
    ". moreover , the mixing angle between the electronic transition of pigment 1 and the vibronic transition of pigment 2 depends on the vibration frequency , which causes variations in the beating amplitudes .",
    "this fact leads to the concept that the degree of quantum mixing between the electronic transition of pigment 1 and the vibronic transition of pigment 2 may be visualized as the beating amplitude of the ground state vibrational coherence .",
    "figure  [ fig : resonance - vib.2 ] plots the beating amplitude of dp1 and the local maxima values of the beating amplitude in the vicinity of dp2 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the beating at the dp1 location originates primarily from the ground state vibrational coherence created via @xmath91 , which is minimally dependent on the quantum mixture between the electronic and vibronic transitions .",
    "however , the beating amplitude of dp1 decreases with the increasing vibrational frequency .",
    "this behavior is explained as being due to the interference between the beating of dp1 and that in the vicinity of dp2 , as shown in fig .  [ fig : resonance - vib.1 ] .",
    "on the other hand , the beating amplitude near dp2 exhibits a maximum in the vicinity of @xmath52 .",

    "this holds even under the influence of the environmentally induced fluctuations , at least at cryogenic temperatures .    however , the root mean squared amplitude of the environmentally induced fluctuations in the electronic energy is estimated as @xmath83 using eqs .   and , and the quantum mixing between the strong electronic and weak vibronic transitions may be more fragile against the protein - induced fluctuations at higher temperatures .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_dependence ] shows the beating amplitude of dp1 and the local maximum value of the beating amplitude in the vicinity of dp2 as a function of temperature for @xmath52 .",
