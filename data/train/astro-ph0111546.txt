    "matching the large scale structure of the universe remains one of the most important constraints for models of structure formation .",
    "models have been primarily compared to observations using statistics such as the correlation function , power spectrum and counts - in - cells .",
    "these two - point statistics have shown that galaxies are indeed clustered and have allowed us to reject models , such as the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) with @xmath5 , as it does not have enough power on large scales .",
    "similar constraints from the cosmic microwave background measurements , supernova ia experiments , large scale structure and clusters ( see bahcall et al .",
    "1999 for a recent review ) have led to the development of a consensus flat cosmological constant - dominated cdm model .",
    "all currently examined cdm models begin with gaussian random phase initial conditions .",
    "inflation predicts that the seeds for structure formation should derive from a gaussian random phase distribution ( bardeen , steinhardt & turner 1983 ) .",
    "this can be tested using topological statistics such as the genus statistic ( gott et al .",
    "the topology of the large scale structure is invariant during the linear growth of structure , thus , after appropriate smoothing on large scales , the topology of the present galaxy distribution can be related to that of the initial density field .",
    "this allows a test of the random phase hypothesis as any deviation of the measured topology might be evidence for non - gaussian initial conditions . on",
    "relatively smaller scales , the topology of the smoothed galaxy density quantifies the degree of non - linear evolution and/or biasing of galaxy formation with respect to the mass density at the present epoch .",
    "the genus statistic has been measured from many different galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "gott et al .",
    "( 1989 ) applied the 3d genus statistic to small samples of galaxies .",
    "it has since been applied to subsequently larger surveys ; the 3d genus of the ssrs was measured by park , gott & da costa ( 1992 ) , moore et al .",
    "( 1992 ) applied it to the qdot survey , rhoads et al .",
    "( 1994 ) analyzed abell clusters , vogeley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) analyzed the cfa survey and canavezes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analyzed the pscz survey . in 2d , the method has been applied to the cfa survey ( park et al .",
    "1993 ) and the lcrs survey ( colley 1997 ) .",
    "the 2d genus of the microwave background has also been measured ( colley , gott & park 1996 ) .",
    "these papers have all concluded that the genus curve obtained was consistent with the universe having gaussian initial conditions but in some cases , results were limited by the size of the surveys .",
    "some evidence for departure from gaussianity was found as a result of non - linear gravitational evolution and/or biasing of galaxies as compared to the mass .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the genus of the largest galaxy redshift survey that is publicly available , the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) . in section [ sec : survey ] we describe the survey in more detail . in section [ sec : genus ]",
    "we describe the genus statistic and in section [ sec : res ] we present our results .",
    "we draw conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the 2dfgrs is an optical spectroscopic survey of objects brighter than b@xmath0=19.45 selected from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990a , b ) .",
    "the 2dfgrs survey is divided into two main regions , with additional random fields observed to improve the angular coverage for statistics such as the power spectrum . for this analysis",
    "we do not use the random fields .",
    "the two areas of interest are the south galactic pole ( sgp ) region , which covers the region @xmath6 , @xmath7 and a region which is close to the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    the data that we analyze are from the public release that was distributed to the community in june 2001 ( colless et al . 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "102,426 galaxy redshifts were contained in the data release , making this the largest redshift survey that is publicly available .",
    "as the survey is not finished , the angular selection function is complicated . to match this",
    "when we construct random catalogs , required when estimating the genus , we use the software developed by the 2dfgrs team and distributed as part of the data release . for any given coordinates ( @xmath10 ) , the expected probability of a galaxy being contained in the 2dfgrs survey region is returned .",
    "we construct a volume - limited sample from the 2dfgrs in order to obtain a radial selection function that is uniform , thus the only variation in the space density of galaxies with radial distance is due to clustering .",
    "this means no weighting scheme is required when constructing the density field but it does restricts the number of objects in a volume - limited sample extracted from this data .",
    "we select a volume limit of @xmath11=0.138 .",
    "this value maintains the maximum number of galaxies in the sample .",
    "we adopt the global @xmath12-correction + evolution correction found for b@xmath0 selected galaxies in the eso slice project ( zucca et al .",
    "1997 ) and adopted by the 2dfgrs team ( norberg et al . 2001 ) and use @xmath13 following the 2dfgrs team and to maintain consistency with the simulation we will describe in section [ sec : res ] , we adopt a @xmath14 cosmology when converting redshift into comoving distances .",
    "for this cosmology , the redshift limit of @xmath11=0.138 corresponds to a comoving distance of 398@xmath15mpc .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      as a final comparison , we compare the genus of the 2dfgrs with the genus of a gaussian random field ( grf ) that has the same power spectrum as the 2dfgrs .",
    "the power spectrum of the 2dfgrs has been measured by percival et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but is only presented in a form where it is divided by a linear theory power spectrum with values of @xmath16 with @xmath17=1 and @xmath18=1 .",
    "we use cmbfast to construct such a power spectrum , assuming that @xmath19=0.7 and that @xmath20=1 .",
    "we multiply the points presented in percival et al . to obtain an estimate of the 2dfgrs power spectrum .",
    "we also measure the power spectrum from the two ngp and sgp volume - limited samples we have constructed here to check consistency and find that the three power spectra have approximately the same shape . on scales larger than 10@xmath15mpc and up to 400@xmath15mpc , the 2dfgrs p(k ) is fairly similar in shape to the cmbfast power spectrum . to test",
    "how sensitive the genus curve is to the exact features in the power spectrum curve , we compare the genus curves we obtain using a power law with p@xmath21 , the cmbfast power spectrum and the estimate of the 2dfgrs power spectrum we obtain here and find little difference between the cmbfast and 2dfgrs genus curves and only small differences between these genus estimates and ones created with the power law input .",
    "we construct the grf on a 256@xmath22 array by assigning values to the real and imaginary parts of each fourier mode which are gaussian deviates .",
    "we then imprint the shape of the ngp and sgp regions onto the grid before we smooth the density field and calculate the genus , exactly as described above .",
    "we compare the genus of the 2dfgrs with that of a grf with the same power spectrum to see if the non - linear clustering that appears in the data and in the simulations affects the amplitude of the 2d genus . in previous papers that examine the genus in 3d , significant",
    "damping of the amplitude of the data genus curve has been found as compared to the genus curve of a grf .",
    "vogeley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found that for smoothing scales of 6@xmath15mpc that a grf had a 2@xmath4 higher amplitude than the genus curve of the cfa survey . on larger smoothing scales",
    "this difference was reduced and at 16@xmath15mpc , the two curves had consistent amplitude .",
    "we find in 2d that we do not see the same damping that has previously been seen in the 3d genus .",
    "for values of @xmath23 , the amplitude of the grf genus curve is fairly similar to that of the 2dfgrs but on positive @xmath24 scales , the amplitude is lower than the 2dfgrs . on these large scales",
    ", the data is definitely showing an excess of overdensities , as shown earlier in figure [ fig : simcomp ] .",
    "the best fitting gaussian curve has a comparable amplitude to the underdense part of the genus curve but a lower amplitude than the overdense part of the genus curve .",
    "several factors could account for the apparent discrepancy between the 2 and 3d genus amplitude ratios",
    ". it may be that our smoothing length of 10@xmath15 is close enough to the linear regime that no amplitude difference due to non - linear clustering may be seen .",
    "note that our 10@xmath15mpc smoothing length would be @xmath25mpc if we used the smoothing length definition adopted in in older genus papers .",
    "vogeley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found no effect in 3d for @xmath26mpc .",
    "it may also be that the non - linear clustering has a smaller effect on the 2d genus , where data are projected and thereby smoothed over the width of the survey , thus making the effective smoothing length larger .",
    "however , we repeated this analysis using a 2d smoothing length of only 5@xmath15mpc and found similar results . because an excess of clusters may reflect biasing of the galaxies with respect to the mass distribution , it will be interesting to repeat this analysis with the final data set to examine whether the completed sample exhibits this amplitude excess in the genus curve at high density thresholds .",
    "if these partial data in the 2dfgrs strips were slightly biased toward high density regions , perhaps because denser fields were given targeting priority over lower density regions during early observations , then the complete sample might lack such a feature .",
    "we measure the genus from a 100,000 galaxy redshift sample of the 2dfgrs , the largest redshift sample publicly available to date . we find that the genus curves of the ngp and sgp are slightly different , with the ngp region displaying an excess of isolated clusters and the sgp region displays a slight excess of isolated voids .",
    "these shifts are only significant at the 1@xmath4 level when we compare the genus curves to mock catalogs drawn from a @xmath2cdm simulation .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same for two choices of the smoothing length .",
    "we average the ngp and sgp data and find that the average genus curve is consistent with the @xmath2cdm simulation .",
    "we find that the average 2dfgrs genus curve reveals a smaller number of isolated voids than clusters in the survey , although the points in the genus curve that show this slight excess of clusters are highly correlated .",
    "we demonstrate that in spite of the current incompleteness in the geometry , the genus can be accurately recovered .",
    "no bias is introduced into the shape of the genus curve by the current angular coverage .",
    "we compare the 2dfgrs genus curve with that for a grf with the same power spectrum .",
    "we do not find any significant amplitude depression in the amplitude of the 2dfgrs genus curve due to non - linear clustering .",
    "this may be due to the large smoothing length , may be a feature of the 2d genus , or may indicate a real excess in the number of isolated clusters in the the 2dfgrs that is not predicted directly from the power spectrum alone .",
    "colley ( 1997 ) found that the 2d genus of the las campanas redshift survey agrees well with a gaussian random field . a larger sample of galaxies will reveal whether there really is an excess of over dense regions , or whether this is a feature of the observing strategy applied so far .",
