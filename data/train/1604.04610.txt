    "there is interest across physics , mathematics , engineering , materials research , and computer science in finding robust experimental manifestations of topologically ordered phases with non - abelian anyonic low - energy excitations .",
    "not only are non - abelian anyons ( i.e. , neither fermions nor bosons ) suitable for topological quantum computation , but they are described by topological quantum field theories ( tqfts ) of intrinsic fundamental interest  @xcite .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite ( fqhe ) is the canonical example of a system supporting topologically ordered phases and is widely thought to support non - abelian anyons in the second orbital electronic landau level ( ll ) , most probably at filling factor @xmath4  @xcite .",

    "since su@xmath6 tqft supports a richer version of non - abelian anyons that can realize _ universal _ fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite , there is a great deal of interest in the 12/5 fqhe . in this work",
    ", we focus on the enigmatic fqhe at @xmath0 .",
    "compared to the rather ubiquitous @xmath4 fqhe , the experimental literature for @xmath0 (= 2 + 2/5 filling ) is sparse with only a few experimental reports of its observation .",
    "the 12/5 fqhe was observed in a 30 nm wide gaas quantum well with electron densities of @xmath8@xmath9 at magnetic field strengths of @xmath10 tesla at temperatures @xmath11-@xmath12 mk  @xcite .",
    "in addition to its fragility ( the 12/5 fqhe is observed only in the highest quality samples with little disorder ) , the real enigma is the corresponding particle - hole conjugate fqhe at 13/5 ( @xmath13 ) , which has never been observed in spite of other fqhes in the second ll ( e.g. , 7/3 and 8/3 , 11/5 and 14/5 ) showing both particle - hole conjugate states with roughly equal strength .",
    "this discrepancy is puzzling because in the lowest ll the fqhes at @xmath2 and 3/5 are both routinely observed , are to good approximation particle - hole conjugates of one another  @xcite , and are well - described by the composite fermion ( cf ) theory  @xcite .",
    "the exotic , rather than cf - like nature of the 12/5 state has been discussed based on the analysis of the experimentally measured energy gap  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the 12/5 and 13/5 fqhes ( with roughly equal strength ) are observed in systems where two subbands are occupied ( e.g. , bilayers , thick quantum wells ) such that the chemical potential is in the lowest ll ( but in the higher subband so two lls are completely full )  @xcite . in this work",
    "we provide a possible explanation for the absence ( presence ) of a 13/5 ( 12/5 ) fqhe in the second ll as arising from the ll mixing effect that explicitly breaks the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "several candidate wave functions for @xmath0 have been proposed and studied  @xcite under idealized conditions , using the coulomb interaction without particle - hole symmetry breaking .",
    "two recent numerical studies  @xcite reinforced initial results  @xcite that the ground state at @xmath0 is in the non - abelian @xmath5 read - rezayi ( rr ) phase .",
    "both studies perturbed the interaction finding a finite region of stability around the coulomb point .",
    "all works considered particle - hole symmetric two - body hamiltonians , so all conclusions made therein regarding the @xmath0 state are equally valid for the particle - hole conjugate state at @xmath1 .",
    "thus , existing theories provide evidence that the experimentally observed 12/5 and ( unobserved ) 13/5 fqhes are both in the rr @xmath5 phase , but can not explain _ why _ one ( i.e. , 12/5 ) exists experimentally and the other ( i.e. , 13/5 ) does not .",

    "we numerically study a realistic model of the fqhe in the second ll using exact diagonalization , systematically including ll mixing effects due to ( the infinite number of ) all other lls .",
    "we find that the ll mixing - induced particle - hole symmetry breaking strongly favors the @xmath0 fqhe over the 13/5 in the second ll , qualitatively in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "by contrast , in the lowest ll , we do not find significant particle - hole symmetry breaking between @xmath2 and 3/5 fqhe .",
    "our work gives a probable explanation for the presence ( absence ) of 12/5 ( 13/5 ) in the second ll and the existence and equal strength of 2/5 and 3/5 fqhes in the lowest ll .",
    "our work also strengthens the claim that at finite ll mixing , a 12/5 fqhe arises from a rr parafermionic non - abelian state ( rather than from abelian composite fermion states as for the 2/5 and 3/5 fqhes ) .",

    "<S> we numerically study the fractional quantum hall effect at filling factors @xmath0 and 13/5 ( the particle - hole conjugate of 12/5 ) in high - quality two - dimensional gaas heterostructures via exact diagonalization including finite well width and landau level mixing . </S>",

    "<S> by contrast , we find both @xmath2 and ( its particle - hole conjugate ) @xmath3 fractional quantum hall effects in the lowest landau level to be robust under landau - level mixing and finite well - width corrections . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a possible explanation for the experimental absence of the 13/5 fractional quantum hall state as caused by landau - level mixing effects . </S>"
