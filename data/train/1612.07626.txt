    "the observational association between long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) has been confirmed during last two decades , supporting the connection between grbs and the death of massive stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the first reliable association between a grb and a sn was that of grb  980425 with sn  1998bw , at a redshift @xmath11 @xcite . since then about 40 supernovae associated with grbs were discovered , and a half of them are spectroscopically confirmed ( e.g. , sn  2003dh , @xcite ; sn  2006aj , @xcite ; sn  2010bh , @xcite ; sn  2013cq , @xcite ; sn  2013fu , @xcite , @xcite ) .    to determine the physical properties of the sn explosion and/or of its progenitor ( a mass of @xmath12ni , an ejecta mass @xmath13 , a total energy of the explosion @xmath14 etc . )",
    "detailed photometrical and spectroscopic data are necessary . due to the lack of observations",
    "the most common way to estimate the physical parameters of grb - sne is to use some `` classical '' light curves and spectra of well - studied sne as templates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". most often the multicolour and bolometric light curves of sn  1998bw and 2003dh are used . however , this empirical method of modelling is based on rather simple assumptions about sn explosions , initial conditions and evolution @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are modelling the multicolour light curves of sn  2013dx , associated with grb  130702a , using the code stella  @xcite .",
    "stella is a package of one - dimensional spherically symmetrical multi - group radiation hydrodynamics code which treats non - equilibrium radiative transfer according to chemical composition and inner structure of a pre - supernova star .",
    "the code has been used for light curve modelling of different types of sne ( ia ,  @xcite ; ib / ic ,  @xcite ; iib ,  @xcite ; iin ,  @xcite ; iip ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the assumptions about the supernova outburst geometry are also simple like in the empirical method , but the consideration of chemical abundances and distribution of different chemical elements inside a pre - supernova star allows one to calculate radiative transfer during the explosion and to build more physically correct modelled light curve .    with the stella code",
    "one can model many properties of the sn explosion .",
    "spectra calculated for every specific time since the explosion allow one to model the multicolour light curves and photospheric velocities of the sn expanding envelope .",
    "the calculations take into account distribution of abundance of chemical elements in the envelope before the explosion , the interaction between the inner layers and the compact core , and so on .",
    "another advantage of modelling is that it makes it possible to investigate a line - of - sight extinction by the circumburst medium by comparing modelled and observed light curves in various photometric filters .",
    "the results from the stella code were found to be in a good agreement with those from other well - known hydro - dynamic codes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we will assume that the afterglow light curve is achromatic after @xmath51 between x - ray and optical band - passes and use our best fit x - ray light curve parameters to subtract the afterglow trend from the optical light curve of grb 130702a .",
    "the results of our fit and the known redshift allow us to estimate the isotropic - equivalent energy release in the x - rays by integrating the obtained bpl function from 1  d to 225  d after the trigger : @xmath52 erg , and it is a lower limit because of the absence of x - ray data before @xmath48  d.

    "the extended emission in both gbm and spi - acs data looks like a plateau with a cut - off at about 650 s after the trigger .",
    "this component could be connected with a rapidly spinning magnetar activity , which was initially formed during a core collapse stage .",
    "it is clear that the mass of a compact remnant @xmath53 ( see section  [ sec : modelling ] ) is more than oppenheimer - volkoff limit , and the cut - off may be a manifestation of a delayed collapse into a black hole of a spun - down magnetar @xcite , which is already proposed for the explanation of the extended emission phase of some grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the source of a prompt emission can be a neutrino heated jet @xcite .",
    "later , if an accretion rate is high enough , an activation of blandford - znajek jet @xcite can be a source of a high energy extended emission @xcite .",
    "an emission cut - off could be explained by a rapid decrease of the accretion rate .",
    "the latter scenario is less plausible because of high radius of a pre - supernova star and consequently large size of an accretion disc .",
    "detailed analysis of the extended emission of grb 130702a will be presented elsewhere ( minaev et al . , in preparation ) .      assuming a power - law model to be valid down to 1 kev ( see section  [ sec : obsgamma ] )",

    "almost all long grbs follow @xmath60 relation  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that grb  130702a also follows the amati relation , then its @xmath61 parameter value should be within 750 kev ( @xmath62  2-@xmath63 coincidence level ) .",
    "however , the energy spectrum of grb 130702a is well fitted by a simple power - law model with index of @xmath44 and does not show presence of spectral break in energy range of 1015000 kev .",
    "the value of the spectral index is typical for @xmath64 of band function   @xcite and may indicate that @xmath65 is less than lower limit of analysed energy range : median values of spectral parameters obtained for gbm bursts see in tables 3 - 4 in  @xcite .",
    "under this assumption we estimate upper limit of @xmath65 to be approximately 10 kev . in this case",
    "grb  130702a will follow the amati relation .",
    "similar result was also obtained by  @xcite .      in section  [ sec : xrt ] we have fitted the x - ray light curve of grb  130702a with a bpl .",
    "there is an enhancement of the flux in the residuals plot ( see lower panel of fig .",
    "[ xrt ] ) .",
    "the flux of the enhancement , integrated in the time interval of @xmath66 d after the trigger , is @xmath67 erg @xmath34 s@xmath56 , which is equivalent to the luminosity @xmath68 erg s@xmath56 .",

    "we can not distinguish weather it is related to a flare activity of the grb afterglow or to an x - ray radiation from the sn component .",
    "if this enhancement is related to the sn component , the corresponding luminosity is 4 orders higher than the x - ray luminosity of the well known sn  1993j ( sn iib , * ? ? ?",
    "however , there are some grb - sne discussed in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where x - ray luminosities of grb - sne events are comparable with our estimates .      in the section [ sec : modelling ] we derived a value of the total energy of the sn explosion @xmath4 erg and the bolometric energy of the sn radiation from far ir to extreme uv @xmath70 erg .",
    "we would like to estimate the radiative efficiency of the sn @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is an amount of the energy released in the radiation in both optical range and x - rays , @xmath73 .",
    "suggesting that the enhancement of the x - ray flux in the period of @xmath66 d after the trigger is related to the sn activity ( see section  [ subsec : xray ] ) , we estimate the energy of the sn released in the x - ray domain as @xmath74 erg . compiling all these values the radiative efficiency of the sn explosion is @xmath75 per cent . otherwise ,",
    "if we suggest that the sn x - ray emission is negligible , then we obtain a conservative lower limit of the efficiency @xmath76 per cent .",
    "in our model we obtained the pre - supernova star mass @xmath2 and the mass of the resulting compact remnant @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the total mass of the ejecta is @xmath77 .",
    "the large ejecta mass and the possible presence of clumps of matter around the progenitor ( bump in red filters ) are consistent with the explosion of a rather massive star and suggest that the progenitor of sn 2013dx was a massive wolf - rayet star , whose strong winds drove the stripping of the outer layers .",
    "the higher ejecta mass is predicted for some type ic supernovae from a massive progenitor  ( e.g. , sn  2011bm , * ? ? ?",
    "the final mass of black hole is compatible with current observations and theoretical predictions ( see figure  20 of   * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the ejecta mass is greater than that obtained by d15 and t16 , and also greater than ejecta masses of other grb - sne , collected by t16 and by ( * ? ?",
    "* see table  1 there ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the mass of synthesized nickel @xmath78 is lower than that averaged by all grb - sne and barely falls in 1-@xmath79 interval around the average value .",
    "concerning the total energy of the explosion @xmath14 , it is greater than the average value and falls into the top third of all grb - sne total energy list .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of supernova - like explosion induced by gamma - ray burst in a binary system .",
    "the ejecta of a grb exposes a white dwarf companion and initiates type ia supernova explosion",
    ". it would lead to sn  ia phenomenon associated with gamma - ray burst . using stella code",
    "we modelled the light curves of sn  2013dx with sn  ia model ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the resulting light curves fit rather well the data ( see fig . [ sn1a ] ) , but the photospheric velocities calculated using this model do not correspond to those measured spectroscopically by d15 and t16 . therefore , the sn  ia model should be discarded .    in t16 the main parameters of the sn",
    "were obtained using the sn  1998bw as a template . but assuming those parameters as input for the modelling we could not obtain a good agreement ( see section  [ sec : modelling ] and fig .",
    "[ lc - toy ] ) .",
    "the parameters reported by t16 do not allow us to reproduce the observations by the model .",
    "thereby we suggest , that the light curve of sn  1998bw is not an universal template to describe grb associated supernovae . in the case of sn  2013dx",
    "the template of sn  2003dh , used in d15 , gives better input parameters for the light curve modelling .",
    "the resulting model is the best from all of the models considered , still there remain some problems to be resolved .    1 .",
    "there is a problem with simultaneous fitting of observational data in all filters .",
    "the time position of the maximum in the modelled and observational light curves does not coincide in every observational range , especially in blue filters .",
    "there is an option to vary the start time of the outburst @xmath15 , but for good agreement between the model and the data one need to choose different @xmath15 for blue and red filters . but",
    "this would break the self - consistence of the model .",
    "this problem may be accounted for by the asymmetry of the outburst .",
    "2 .   despite the modelled quasibolometric light curve fits well observational data , the multicolour model does not fit well the peak of the sn in blue filters .",
    "the discrepancy between observational points in @xmath81 and @xmath82 filters and resulting modelled light curves may be explained by additional absorption along the line of sight which is not included in the host extinction . in @xmath82 filter near the observed maximum the difference between the observations and the model is @xmath83 corresponds to @xmath84 depending on the adopted extinction law . assuming the wind - like medium and the normalization density parameter @xmath85 from @xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : xrt ] ) we estimated the hydrogen column density @xmath86 in the host galaxy of the source integrating the profile from the radius of the pre - supernova star @xmath5 to infinity .",
    "we obtained @xmath87 @xmath34 . assuming the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath88 proposed by @xcite for the milky way we estimate the extinction along the line of sight to be @xmath89 .",
    "this estimation does not allow us to explain the significant difference between the modelled and the observed light curves in blue filters by some extra extinction along the line of sight or in the host galaxy .",
    "3 .   the resulting model does not describe the secondary bump observed during the sn decay phase clearly visible in red filters ( see fig.[lightcurve ] ) .",
    "the bump may be connected not with the sn , but with the afterglow . in this case",
    "it may be explained as an interaction of the ejecta with some inhomogeneities in the surrounding interstellar medium , e.g. , dense interstellar clouds .",
    "the theoretical model when the prompt @xmath90-ray emission re - radiates on some dense shell or cloud in the medium surround the burst progenitor and forms bumps on the light curve was proposed by @xcite and there are a few papers with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the model of the thick shell or cloud predicts the chromatic behaviour of the bump , i.e. , the bluer the filter the earlier the bump , and a relative brightness in bluer filters should be more pronounced than in red ones .",
    "our observations clearly support the prediction about chromatic behaviour , but the flux of the observed bump does not agree with the prediction : on the light curves ( fig .  [ lightcurve]a ) we clearly see the bump in @xmath91 filter , while there is no bump in @xmath92 filter .",
    "however , it might be explained by a sparse sampling of the light curve in @xmath92 filter",
    ". moreover , explanation of the bump requires specific configuration , in particular , there should be a compact dense cloud off - axis to observer , but not to far to be within the emission cone .",
    "the duration of the bump ( @xmath93 days ) is explained in numerical simulations  @xcite with the stella code .",
    "+ similar bumps present on the light curves of other type ib / c sne , sn  2003dh associated with grb  030329 , but in this case it is difficult to distinguish the behaviour of the sn light curve from that of the extremely non - monotonic afterglow ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there is a possibility in the stella calculations to take into account additional interaction of the sn ejecta with the interstellar medium by surrounding the star by a shell ( or super - wind ) which could induce the bumps on the modelled light curve @xcite .",
    "we did not implement super - wind in current modelling .",
    "however , the bump has appeared in some other models in which @xmath94ni is put in the centre of explosion without mixing .",
    "the absence of the bump on the optimal resulting modelled light curve ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurve]a ) may be also connected to the simplicity of the assumptions , which underlie the model and the code itself . + it is unlikely , that the late bump is related to the central engine activity , and thus , to the afterglow evolution .",
    "this bump could be related to the re - radiation of the prompt gamma - ray emission by a clumpy circumburst medium , but in this case one could expect to observe several bumps from the interaction of gamma - rays with every clump around the source ( e. g. , the late light curve of grb  030329 * ? ? ?",
    ". the observed bump could be natural if the circumburst medium consisted of only one single clump .",
    "we can not definitely determine the bump s nature and we suggest that it is related to the sn .",

    "we collected all available optical data of this event : the multicolour light curves of grb  130702a contain 330 data points in filters @xmath1 until 88 days after the burst start , more than 280 of them form the light curves of the associated supernova sn  2013dx .",

    "disagreement between the modelled flux and the data increases from red to blue filter ( from @xmath92 to @xmath82 ) .",
    "comparison between the model and the data at the peak of the light curve suggests an evidence for an additional line - of - sight extinction in the host galaxy , but the presence of this additional extinction is not confirmed by other methods of investigation , namely , by modelling the host sed and circumburst environment density .",
