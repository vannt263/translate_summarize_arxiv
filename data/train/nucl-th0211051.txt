    "investigations of the @xmath0-nucleus interaction are motivated by various reasons .",
    "some of them , such as the possibility of forming quasi - bound states or resonances @xcite in the @xmath0-nucleus system , are purely of nuclear nature .",
    "the others are related to the study of the properties and structure of the @xmath4 resonance which is strongly coupled to the @xmath5 channel .",
    "for example , it is interesting to investigate the behavior of the @xmath0-meson in nuclear media where , after colliding with the nucleons , it readily forms the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "the interaction of this resonance with the surrounding nucleons can be described in different ways @xcite , depending on whether the structure of this resonance is defined in terms of some quark configurations or by the coupling of meson - baryon channels , as suggested in ref .",
    "the estimation by tiwari _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows , that in case of pseudoscalar @xmath7 coupling there is an essential density dependent reduction of the @xmath0-meson mass and of the @xmath8 mixing angle .",
    "the importance of the influence of the nuclear medium on the mesons passing through it , was recently emphasized by drechsel _",
    "if this influence is described in terms of self - energies and effective masses , then the passing of @xmath9-mesons through the nucleus provides `` saturation '' of the isobar propagator ( or self - energy ) .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself even in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "similar ideas were discussed also in ref .",
    "@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the propagation of @xmath0-mesons inside the nucleus is a new challenge for theorists .",
    "another interesting issue related to the @xmath0-nucleus interaction is the study of charge symmetry breaking , which may partly be attributed to the @xmath10 mixing ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in principle",
    ", one can extract the value of the mixing angle from experiments involving @xmath0-nucleus interaction and compare the results with the predictions of quark models .",
    "however , to do such an extraction , one has to make an extrapolation of the @xmath0-nucleus scattering amplitude into the area of unphysical energies below the @xmath0-nucleus threshold .",
    "this is a highly model dependent procedure requiring a reliable treatment of the @xmath0-nucleus dynamics .    in this respect ,",
    "few - body systems such as @xmath11 , @xmath0@xmath12he , and @xmath0@xmath13he , have obvious advantages since they can be treated using rigorous faddeev - type equations .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the exact ags theory @xcite has been used in the few calculations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) for the @xmath11 and in one recent calculation @xcite for the @xmath14h and @xmath14he systems .",
    "a solution of the few - body equations presupposes the knowledge of the corresponding two - body @xmath3-matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 off the energy shell . due to the fact that at low energies the @xmath0 meson interacts with a nucleon mainly via the formation of the @xmath6-resonance ,",
    "the inclusion of the higher partial waves ( @xmath17 ) is unnecessary .",
    "furthermore , since the @xmath2 interaction is poorly known , the effect of the fine tuned details of the `` realistic '' @xmath18 potentials would be far beyond the level of the overall accuracy of the @xmath19 theory .",
    "in contrast to the well - established @xmath18 forces , the @xmath2 interaction is constructed using very limited information available , namely , the @xmath2 scattering length and the parameters of the @xmath6-resonance .",
    "furthermore , only the resonance parameters are known more or less accurately while the scattering length ( which is complex ) is determined with large uncertainties .",
    "moreover , practically nothing is known about the off - shell behavior of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "it is simply assumed that the off - shell behavior of this amplitude could be approximated ( like in the case of @xmath9 mesons ) by appropriate yamaguchi form - factors ( see , for example , refs .",
    "however , if the available data are used to construct a potential via , for example , fiedeldey s inverse scattering procedure @xcite , the resulting form factor of the separable potential is not that simple .",
    "the problem becomes even more complicated due to the multichannel character of the @xmath2 interaction with the additional off - shell uncertainties stemming from the @xmath9-meson channel .",
    "in such a situation , it is desirable to narrow as much as possible the uncertainty intervals for the parameters of @xmath2 interaction .",
    "this could be done by demanding consistency of theoretical predictions based on these parameters , with existing experimental data for two- , three- , and four - body @xmath0-nucleus processes .",
    "this is one of the objectives of the present work .",
    "to do this , we calculate the cross sections of coherent @xmath0-photoproduction on @xmath1he and @xmath1h and study their sensitivity to the parameters of the @xmath2 amplitude .",
    "we start by assuming that the compton scattering on a nucleon , @xmath20 as well as the processes of multiple re - appearing of the photon in the intermediate states , @xmath21 give a negligible contribution to the coherent @xmath0-photoproduction on a nucleus @xmath22 . in our model",
    ", we also neglect virtual excitations and breakup of the nucleus immediately after its interaction with the photon . with these assumptions ,",
    "the process @xmath23 can be formally described in two steps : in the first one , the photon produces the @xmath0 meson on one of the nucleons , @xmath24 in the second step ( final state interaction ) the @xmath0 meson is elastically scattered off the nucleus , @xmath25 an adequate treatment of the scattering step is , of course , the most difficult and crucial part of the theory .",
    "the first microscopic calculations concerning the low - energy scattering of the @xmath0-meson from @xmath12h , @xmath12he , and @xmath13he were done in refs .",
    "@xcite where the few - body dynamics of these systems was treated by employing the finite - rank approximation ( fra ) @xcite of the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "this approximation consists in neglecting the continuous spectrum in the spectral expansion @xmath26 of the hamiltonian @xmath27 describing the nucleus .",
    "since the three- and four - body nuclei have only one bound state , fra reduces to @xmath28 physically , this means that we exclude the virtual excitations of the nucleus during its interaction with the @xmath0 meson .",
    "it is clear that the stronger the nucleus is bound , the smaller is the contribution from such processes to the elastic @xmath19 scattering . by comparing with the results of the exact ags calculations , it was shown@xcite that even for @xmath11 scattering , having the weakest nuclear binding , the fra method works reasonably well , which implies that we obtain sufficiently accurate results by applying this method to the @xmath0@xmath12h , @xmath0@xmath12he , and even more so to the @xmath0@xmath13he scattering .",
    "in essence , the fra method can be described as follows ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath29 be the total @xmath19 hamiltonian , where @xmath30 describes the free @xmath0-nucleus motion and @xmath31 the sum of the two - body @xmath0-nucleon potentials .",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath32 for the @xmath0-nucleus @xmath3-matrix can be rewritten as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and the auxiliary operator @xmath35 is split into @xmath22 components of faddeev - type , @xmath36 satisfying the following system of equations @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the two - body @xmath3-matrix describing the interaction of the @xmath0-meson with the @xmath39-th nucleon , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 it should be emphasized that up to this point no approximation has been made and , therefore , the set of equations ( [ teq]-[tetani ] ) is equivalent to the initial equation  ( [ lsinitial ] ) .",
    "however , to solve eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) , we have to resort to the approximation ( [ fraapprox ] ) which simplifies its kernel ( [ kernel ] ) to @xmath41 with this approximation , the sandwiching of eq .",
    "( [ teq ] ) between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the partial wave decomposition give a one - dimensional integral equation for the amplitude of the process ( [ etaaaeta ] ) .",
    "although this one - dimensional equation may look similar to the integral equation of the first - order optical - potential theory , the fra approach is quite different .",
    "firstly , in contrast to the optical potential of the first order , the operator @xmath35 includes all orders of rescattering via solution of eq .",
    "( [ t0i ] ) .",
    "secondly , the @xmath2 amplitudes @xmath44 entering eq .",
    "( [ t0i ] ) , are taken as operators in the many - body space and off the energy shell ( note that @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ tetani ] ) is four - body propagator with @xmath19 reduced mass and @xmath46 is total four - body energy ) , i.e. the fra method does not involve the so - called `` impulse approximation '' ( using free two - body amplitudes for @xmath38 ) which is an indispensable part of the optical theory .    the question then arises how a photon can be included in this formalism in order to describe the photoproduction process ( [ gaaeta ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by following the same procedure as in ref.@xcite where the reaction ( [ gaaeta ] ) with @xmath47 was treated within the framework of the exact ags equations , and the photon was introduced by considering the @xmath2 and @xmath48 states as two different channels of the same system .",
    "this implies that the operators @xmath38 should be replaced by @xmath49 matrices .",
    "it is clear that such replacements of the kernels of the integral equations  ( [ t0i ] ) and subsequently of the integral equation ( [ teq ] ) lead to solutions having a similar matrix form @xmath50 here @xmath51 describes the compton scattering , @xmath52 the photoproduction process , and @xmath53 the elastic @xmath0 scattering on the @xmath39-th nucleon .",
    "what is finally needed is the cross section @xmath54 of the reaction ( [ gaaeta ] ) averaged over orientations @xmath55 of the initial nuclear spin and photon polarization @xmath56 and summed over spin orientations @xmath57 in the final state . here",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the spatial and spin - isospin parts of @xmath60 ( with the third components of the nuclear spin and isospin being @xmath55 and @xmath61 respectively ) , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the momenta of the photon and @xmath0 meson , @xmath64 is the energy of the photon , @xmath65 the mass of the nucleus , and @xmath66 the reduced mass of the meson and the nucleus .",
    "however , it is technically more convenient to consider radiative @xmath0-absorption , _ i.e. _ , the inverse reaction .",
    "then the photoproduction cross section can be obtained by applying the principle of detailed balance .",
    "the reason for this is that all the processes in which the photon appears more than once , _",
    "i.e. _ , the terms of the integral equations of type @xmath67 or @xmath68 involving more than one electromagnetic vertex , can be neglected .",
    "omission of these terms in ( [ teq ] ) results in decoupling the elastic scattering equation @xmath69 from the equation for the radiative absorption @xmath70 once @xmath71 is calculated , the radiative absorption @xmath3-matrix ( [ absorption ] ) can be obtained by integration .",
    "therefore , the procedure of calculating the photoproduction cross section ( [ sechenie ] ) consists of the following steps :    * solving the system of equations @xmath72 for the auxiliary elastic - scattering operators @xmath73  . *",
    "calculating ( by integration ) the auxiliary matrices @xmath74 from @xmath75 * solving the integral equation @xmath76 for the elastic - scattering @xmath3-matrix . * calculating ( by integration ) the radiative absorption @xmath3-matrix @xmath77 * substituting this @xmath3-matrix into eq .",
    "( [ sechenie ] ) to obtain the differential cross section for the photoproduction .",
    "this is possible because the absolute values of the photoproduction and radiative absorption @xmath3-matrices coincide .",
    "to implement the steps described in the previous section , we need the two - body @xmath3-matrices @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the elastic @xmath2 scattering and the radiative absorption @xmath80 on a single nucleon , respectively .",
    "furthermore , all equations ( [ proc1]-[proc4 ] ) have to be sandwiched between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( ground state of the nucleus ) . since at low energies both the elastic scattering and photoproduction of the @xmath0 meson on a nucleon",
    "proceed mainly via formation of the @xmath6 resonance , we may retain only the @xmath81-waves in the partial wave expansions of the corresponding two - body @xmath3-matrices .",
    "the problem of constructing an @xmath2 potential or directly the corresponding @xmath3-matrix @xmath78 has no unique solution since the only experimental information available consists of the @xmath6-resonance pole position @xmath82 and the @xmath2 scattering length @xmath83 . in the present work we use three different versions of @xmath78 .      without any scattering data it is practically impossible to construct a reliable @xmath2 potential . in the low - energy region , however , the elastic scattering can be viewed as the process of formation and subsequent decay of @xmath6 resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath84 this implies that the corresponding breit - wigner formula could be a good approximation for the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "therefore , we may adopt the following ansatz @xmath85 where the propagator @xmath86 , describing the intermediate state of the process ( [ diagram ] ) , is assumed to have a simple breit - wigner form @xmath87 which guaranties that the @xmath3-matrix ( [ tetan ] ) has a pole at the proper place .",
    "the vertex function @xmath88 for the processes @xmath5@xmath89 is chosen to be @xmath90 which in configuration space is of yukawa - type .",
    "the range parameter @xmath91@xmath92 was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite while the parameters of the @xmath6-resonance @xmath93 are taken from ref .",
    "the strength parameter @xmath94 is chosen to reproduce the @xmath0-nucleon scattering length @xmath83 , @xmath95 the imaginary part of which accounts for the flux losses into the @xmath96 channel . here",
    "@xmath97 is the @xmath2 reduced mass .",
    "the two - body scattering length @xmath83 is not accurately known .",
    "different analyses  @xcite provided values for @xmath83 in the range @xmath98 in most recent publications the value used for i m @xmath83 is around @xmath99fm . however , for re@xmath83 the estimates are still very different ( compare , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we assume that @xmath100 the @xmath3-matrix @xmath78 constructed in this way reproduces the scattering length ( [ etanlength ] ) and the @xmath6 pole , but apparently violates the two - body unitarity since it does not obey the two - body lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "an alternative way of constructing the two - body @xmath3-matrix @xmath78 is to solve the corresponding lippmann - schwinger equation with an appropriate separable potential having the same form - factors ( [ ffactor ] ) .",
    "however , a one - term separable @xmath3-matrix obtained in this way , does not have a pole at @xmath101 . to recover the resonance behavior in this case",
    ", we use the trick suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , we use an energy - dependent strength of the potential @xmath102 \\ , g(k')\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is complex while @xmath104 and @xmath105 are real constants . with this ansatz for the potential ,",
    "the lippmann - schwinger equation gives the @xmath3-matrix in the form  ( [ tetan ] ) with @xmath106 / ( 1 - i\\sqrt{2 z \\mu_{\\eta n } } /\\alpha)^2}\\ . \\label{tdeloff}\\ ] ] the constants @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 can be chosen in such a way that the corresponding scattering amplitude reproduces the scattering length @xmath83 and has a pole at @xmath101 .",
    "this version of @xmath78 also reproduces the scattering length ( [ etanlength ] ) and the @xmath6 pole .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with the condition of two - body unitarity .",
    "we can also construct @xmath78 in the form ( [ tetan ] ) , with the same @xmath86 as in ( [ tau1 ] ) , but obeying the unitarity condition @xmath107 of course , with the simple form ( [ tetan ] ) we can not satisfy the condition ( [ unitarity ] ) at all energies . to simplify the derivations",
    ", we impose this condition on @xmath78 at @xmath108 .",
    "( [ unitarity ] ) is real , it can fix only one parameter and we need one more condition to fix both the real and imaginary parts of the complex @xmath94 .",
    "as the second equation , we used the real or imaginary part of eq .",
    "( [ t000 ] ) ( version iii - a or iii - b respectively ) with @xmath83 given by ( [ etanlength ] ) .",
    "this procedure guaranties two - body unitarity and gives the correct position of the resonance pole , but the resulting @xmath78 provides a value of @xmath83 which , of course , slightly differs from  ( [ etanlength ] ) , namely , @xmath109    in what follows we use these three versions of the matrix @xmath78 .",
    "all of them have the same separable form ( [ tetan ] ) but different @xmath86 . comparison of the results obtained with these three @xmath3-matrices can give an indication of the importance of two - body unitarity in the photoproduction processes .",
    "in constructing the radiative absorption @xmath3-matrix @xmath79 , the @xmath6 dominance in the near - threshold region also plays an important role .",
    "it was experimentally shown  @xcite that , at low energies , the reaction ( [ gnneta ] ) proceeds mainly via formation of the @xmath6-resonance , @xmath110 by the @xmath81-wave @xmath111 multipole .",
    "this means that in the standard cgln decomposition of the @xmath112 amplitude ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) only the term proportional to the dot - product @xmath113 of the nucleon spin and photon polarization can be retained , i.e. @xmath114    the dominance of the process ( [ diagramgamma ] ) implies that @xmath115 in this energy region can be written in a separable form similar to ( [ tetan ] ) .",
    "to construct such a separable @xmath3-matrix , we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath116 was considered as an element of a multi - channel @xmath3-matrix which simultaneously describes experimental data for the processes @xmath117 on the energy shell in the @xmath6-channel ( the @xmath2 scattering length obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is the same as we use for constructing versions i and ii of @xmath118 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we take the @xmath3-matrix @xmath119 from ref .",
    "@xcite and extend it off the energy shell via @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a parameter .",
    "the yamaguchi form - factors used in this ansatz go to unity on the energy shell . since @xmath121 is not known , this parameter is varied in our calculations within an interval @xmath122 which is a typical range for meson - nucleon forces .",
    "it is known that @xmath116 is different for neutron and proton . in this work",
    "we assume that they have the same functional form ( [ toff ] ) but differ by a constant factor , @xmath123 multipole analysis  @xcite gives for this factor the estimate @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , if we direct the @xmath46-axis along the photon momentum @xmath125 , the radiative absorption @xmath3-matrix entering our equations , can be written as @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are transverse components of the photon polarization vector while @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the operators projecting onto the proton and neutron isotopic states respectively .      since the @xmath3-matrices @xmath78 and @xmath79 are poorly known and their uncertainties significantly limit the overall accuracy of the theory , it is not necessary to use any sophisticated ( `` realistic '' ) potential to describe the @xmath18 interaction .",
    "therefore we may safely assume that the nucleons interact with each other only in the @xmath81-wave state .    to obtain the necessary nuclear wave function @xmath60",
    ", we solve the few - body equations of the integro - differential equation approach ( idea )  @xcite with the malfliet - tjon potential  @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the hyperspherical harmonic expansion method applied to faddeev - type equations .",
    "in fact , in the case of @xmath81-wave potentials , the idea is fully equivalent to the exact faddeev equations .",
    "therefore , the bound states used in our calculations are derived , to all practical purposes , via an exact formalism .",
    "the wave function @xmath131 of the @xmath1h/@xmath1he system obtained by solving the idea equations with the malfliet - tjon potential , has only the symmetric @xmath81-wave spatial component @xmath58 multiplied by the antisymmetric spin - isospin part @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , @xmath136 are the mixed symmetry states in the spin and isospin sub - spaces .",
    "the matrix element of @xmath137 in eq .",
    "( [ sechenie ] ) involves the average not only over the spatial part of @xmath60 but over @xmath138 as well .",
    "the average @xmath139 can be done before we start solving equations ( [ proc1]-[proc4 ] ) .    since @xmath78 , @xmath45 , and @xmath140",
    "do not involve spin - isospin operators , the averaging of eqs .",
    "( [ proc1 ] ) and ( [ proc3 ] ) over @xmath138 is trivial : it does not produce any additional coefficients .",
    "( [ proc2 ] ) , however , changes .",
    "indeed , for each nucleon ( @xmath141 ) , it involves the operator ( [ general ] ) which causes nucleon spin to flip over .",
    "formal averaging of @xmath142 ( for @xmath143 ) over the states @xmath59 having definite values of the @xmath46-components of total spin ( @xmath55 ) and isospin ( @xmath61 ) , gives the same results @xmath144    \\displaystyle    \\delta_{-s'_z , s_z}f_{\\rm off}^{\\gamma \\eta }    \\cdot\\frac13(\\epsilon_x+i\\epsilon_y ) & , &    \\quad \\mbox{for } & t_z=-1/2\\ & ( ^3{\\rm h } )    \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] for all three nucleons .",
    "this means that all three matrix elements @xmath145 ( @xmath143 ) acquire the same coefficient , namely , @xmath146 or @xmath147 depending on @xmath61 . via eq .",
    "( [ proc4 ] ) , the same coefficient goes to the matrix element @xmath148 .",
    "since @xmath149 , this gives the factor @xmath150 ( for the case of @xmath1he ) or @xmath151 ( for the case of @xmath1h ) in the final eq .",
    "( [ sechenie ] ) for the photoproduction cross section .",
    "thus , the cross section for the @xmath1he target quadratically depends on @xmath22 while for the case of @xmath1h it is independent of @xmath22 .",
    "figures [ fig1.fig ] and [ fig2.fig ] show the results of our calculations for the total cross section of the coherent process ( [ gaaeta ] ) .",
    "the calculations were done for two nuclear targets , @xmath1h and @xmath1he , using the three versions of @xmath78 described in the section [ twobodyint ] .",
    "the curves corresponding to these three @xmath3-matrices are denoted by ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii - a , iii - b ) , respectively .",
    "we found that the coherent @xmath0-photoproduction on these targets is strongly enhanced in the near - threshold region as compared to higher photon energies ( @xmath152mev ) .",
    "this can be attributed to strong final state interaction caused , for example , by a pole of the scattering @xmath81-matrix , situated in the complex - energy plane not far from the threshold energy , or in other words , to formation of @xmath0-nucleus resonance . in order to emphasize this finding and to remove the insignificant but distracting differences among different curves , we present the results in a normalized form .",
    "each curve shows the ratio @xmath153 with @xmath154 being the corresponding cross section at @xmath155mev , i.e. at the energy where the near - threshold enhancement dies out . at this energy ,",
    "all the curves become flat and are not far from each other as well as from the value of 59.812nb obtained in ref .",
    "the normalization values @xmath154 are given in table [ tab1.tab ] .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1.fig ] , the two versions of @xmath78 , ( i ) and ( ii ) , give significantly different results despite the fact that both of them reproduce the same @xmath83 and the @xmath6-resonance .",
    "this indicates that the scattering of the @xmath0 meson on the nucleons ( final state interaction ) is very important in the description of the near - threshold photoproduction process .",
    "this conclusion is further substantiated when comparing our curves with the corresponding points ( circles ) calculated for the @xmath1he target in ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "the final state interaction was treated using an optical potential of the first order .",
    "it is well - known that the first - order optical theory is not adequate at energies near resonances .",
    "this is the reason why the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite underestimate @xmath156 near the threshold where , with @xmath157 , the systems @xmath0@xmath12h and @xmath0@xmath12he show a resonance behavior @xcite .",
    "significant differences between the corresponding curves ( i ) and ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1.fig ] imply that two - body unitarity is important as well . actually , due to the resonant character of the final state interaction , all the details of @xmath78 have strong influence on the photoproduction cross section in the near - threshold region .",
    "[ fig2.fig ] where we compare the results corresponding to the three choices of @xmath86 in ( [ tetan ] ) , serve as another illustration of this statement .",
    "since nothing is known about the parameter @xmath121 , we assume @xmath158 as its basic value .",
    "this can be motivated by the fact that both the elastic scattering and radiative absorption ( photoproduction ) of the @xmath0 meson on the nucleon go via formation of the same @xmath6 resonance .",
    "this means that at least one vertex , namely , @xmath159 should be the same for both the elastic scattering and radiative absorption .    to find out how crucial the choice of @xmath121 is , we did two additional calculations with @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "we found that even with this wide variation , the corresponding @xmath162 curves show practically identical enhancement of the crosss section ( less than 1% difference ) .",
    "the cross section only slightly increases when the range of the interaction becomes smaller ( when @xmath121 grows ) .",
    "therefore , the dependence on @xmath121 is not very strong and the choice @xmath158 gives a reasonable estimate for the photoproduction cross section .    as far as the dependence of @xmath156 on the choice of the parameter",
    "@xmath163 is concerned , we found ( see sec.[spinisospina ] ) that for @xmath0 photoproduction on @xmath1h the cross section in our model does not depend on @xmath22 , while for the @xmath1he target the @xmath22-dependence is quadratic .",
    "this means that among these two nuclei , the helium is preferable candidate for experimental determination of the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the sign or any phase factor of @xmath22 , however , has no influence on the cross section if the electromagnetic vertex is taken into account only in the first order as it was done in our calculation .",
