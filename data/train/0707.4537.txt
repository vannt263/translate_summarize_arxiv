    "a unified formulation of einstein s theory of gravitation and maxwell s theory of electromagnetism in four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime was first proposed by kaluza and klein using a five - dimensional ( 5d ) geometry  @xcite .",
    "a free test particle in 5d kk spacetime shows its electricity in the reduced 4d spacetime when it moves along the fifth dimension .",
    "moreover a 5d dust field coupled with kk gravity can curve the 5d spacetime in such a way that it provides exactly the source of the electromagnetic field in the 4d spacetime after the reduction  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the coupling of a 5d perfect fluid with kk gravity .",
    "it turns out that the 5d einstein s equation with a source gives a modification of maxwell s equation ( see in section ii ) , which can show its state - relevant effect on high - density or high - temperature condition ( see in section iv ) .",
    "thus this effect provides intriguing possibilities for the experimental test of the kk theory .",
    "note that the kk theory which we are considering is purely classical .",
    "the kk theory has also been studied from the particle physics point of view ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which can show its effects in high energy scale of @xmath0 . whereas the energy scale needed for testing our state - relevant effect",
    "is only around @xmath1 .    in order to reveal the physical implication of the modification more clearly , both the modified maxwell s equations and the corresponding general relativistic mhd",
    "are reformulated in 3 + 1 form ( see in section iii ) .",
    "the formalism is also useful for evolving numerically a relativistic mhd fluid in a spacetime characterized by a strong gravitational field .",
    "taking an ideal fermi gas as an example , the modification term is studied as a function of degeneracy and temperature parameters ( see in section iv ) . moreover",
    "the modification terms for different components of the perfect fluid may be different .",
    "this would result in a net charge excess in high - temperature plasma .",
    "recall that the the electrical neutrality of atoms and of bulk matter has been examined precisely by a number of experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , in those experiments , either the objects considered are not ionized , or the ions in the objects can not be regarded as a perfect fluid .",
    "therefore , these experiments can not provide definite opposite evidence to the classical kk theory since they do not satisfy our premise .",
    "but they do cast some doubts on it . taking account of the state - relevant character ,",
    "we suggest high - temperature plasma in earth laboratory or dense - matter white dwarf in outer space as candidates to test the possible effects of the modified maxwell s equation .",
    "using a 5d geometry , kaluza and klein proposed a unified formulation of gravity and electromagnetism in 4d spacetime  @xcite .",
    "the original kk theory assumed the so - called``_cylinder condition _ '' , which means that there exists a space - like killing vector field @xmath2 on the 5d spacetime ( @xmath3 ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that the abstract index notation  @xcite is employed throughout the paper and the signature of the five - metric is of the convention @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , kaluza also demanded that @xmath2 is normalized , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 later research shows that the ansatz ( [ phi ] ) may be dropped out and the @xmath6 may play a key role in the study of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "being an extra dimension , the orbits of @xmath2 are geometrically circles .",
    "the physical consideration that any displacement in the usual `` physical '' 4d spacetime ( denoted as @xmath7 ) should be orthogonal to the extra dimension implies that the `` physical '' 4d metric should be defined as @xmath8 and the projection operator onto @xmath7 is @xmath9 for practical calculation , it is convenient to take a coordinate system @xmath10 with coordinate basis @xmath11 on @xmath12 adapted to @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "then the 5-metric components @xmath14 take the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "so , locally , the  physical \" spacetime can be understood as a 4-manifold @xmath7 with the coordinates @xmath17 endowed with the metric @xmath18 .",
    "the whole theory is governed by the 5d einstein - hilbert action @xmath19 suppose the range of the fifth coordinate to be @xmath20 and denote @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 , then equation ( [ gaction ] ) becomes a coupling action on @xmath7 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the curvature scalar of @xmath18 on @xmath7 and @xmath25}$ ] .",
    "thus , it results in a 4d gravity @xmath18 coupled to an electromagnetic field @xmath26 and a scalar field @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that , under the ansatz ( [ phi ] ) , 5d kk theory unifies the einstein s gravity and the source - free maxwell s field in the standard formulism .",
    "now we consider a 5d perfect fluid @xmath27 the 5-velocity @xmath28 can be projected onto the `` physical '' spacetime @xmath29 as @xmath30 note that we have @xmath31 , hence it is easy to show that @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the electric charge in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor can be projected on m as @xmath34 . in order to obtain the observed 4d energy - momentum tensor @xmath35 on @xmath7",

    "( [ gaction ] ) that the components of the 5d ricci tensor @xmath43 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the 4d covariant derivative operator associated with @xmath18 .",

    "since relativistic mhd is widely used to study space matter and 3d formulation is frequently applied to dealing with specific issues  @xcite , we now derive the modified results of maxwell s equations and relativistic mhd in 3 + 1 form .",

    ", the value of @xmath115 is drawn from nonrelativistic ( @xmath174 ) to relativistic ( @xmath175 ) regime in fig .  [ beta ] .",
    "it is obvious that we need not to go to extremely relativistic condition since @xmath115 is already close to @xmath170 when @xmath175 . in the specific calculation for an electron gas ,",

    "this result indicates the possibility to test the theory in earth laboratory . for a non - degenerate electron gas at @xmath178",
    ", one may estimate the modification term as @xmath179 . on the other hand , in the experiments on the equality of the electric charges of proton and electron ,",
    "these charges in a conductor are found to be equal within @xmath180 or better ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the proton system in a conductor can not be seen as a perfect fluid and hence does not satisfy our premise .",
    "hence the effective charges of protons in a conductor can not be directly obtained by our modified equations .",
    "so , those experiments are not in severe contradiction with the kk theory . for similar reason",
    ", the experiments reported in ref.@xcite can not provide definite opponent evidence to the kk theory either .",
    "but this kind of experiments do cast some doubts on the classical kk theory .",
    "note that both the electron system and the ion system could be regarded as perfect fluid in high - temperature plasma . in a thermal equilibrium state",
    "the electron and ion in a plasma have the same temperature .",
    "hence they would have different values of @xmath115 .",
    "actually the value of @xmath115 for ion is much smaller than the one for electron when @xmath181 takes value from @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "it turns out that the two important physical parameters for the description of plasma  debye length and plasma frequency @xcite have to be modified in our 5d theory as @xmath184^{\\frac 12 } \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath185^{\\frac 12}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath186 is the number density of electron and @xmath187 the permittivity of vacuum .",
    "since the electromagnetic wave whose frequency is lower than @xmath188 will be reflected while others can transmit through the plasma , the plasma frequency can be measured accurately  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is possible to test the prediction from the 5d kk theory in earth laboratory . for a degenerate idea fermi gas ,",
    "the relation between @xmath115 and @xmath171 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ eta ] . recall that the white dwarf is known to resist the gravity by an electronic degenerate pressure .",
    "it is also possible to test the 5d theory by certain relevant phenomena in outerspace .",
    "note that the vacuum polarization in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) also leads to an effective charge of a point - like particle  @xcite .",
    "so the effective charge viewpoint does not merely come from the kk theory . for the fermi gas in kk theory ,",
    "the larger the density and the temperature , the larger the effective charge factor @xmath189 , which approaches to @xmath190 as a limit .",
    "whereas for qed , the higher the energy scale ( or shorter distance ) , the larger the effective charge @xmath191 , which approaches to infinity as a limit .",
    "therefore the state - relevant maxwell s equation and qed give similar results of larger effective charges .",
    "however , the state - relevant effect in kk theory is a pure classical effect due to the extra dimension of spacetime , whereas the qed effect is a quantum effect irrespective of any extra dimension .",
    "so one does not expect them to be the same .",
    "it is easy to distinguish the two effects by comparing their characters .    in summary ,",
    "the coupling of 5d perfect fluid to kk gravity is fully studied .",
    "the 4d effective equations of this 5d coupling system are derived . in particular , the modified maxwell s equation which is relevant to the equation of state of the source is obtained . to facilitate applications",
    ", we also derive the 3 + 1 form of the modified maxwell s equations and the relativistic mhd .",
    "it turns out that the effective charge density in the kk theory can be written as @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , using an ideal fermi gas model , we study the modification term @xmath115 as a function of degeneracy parameter @xmath171 and the relativity parameter @xmath79 .",
    "it reveals that the traditional maxwell s equation is the low density and low temperature limit of the state - relevant maxwell s equation .",
    "we thus indicate the possibility to test the state - relevant effect both in earth laboratory and in astrophysical phenomena .",
