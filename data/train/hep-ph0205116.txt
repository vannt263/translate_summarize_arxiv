    "the identity of the non - baryonic dark matter , believed to account for about @xmath3 of the total density of the universe @xcite , is one of the major unanswered questions in cosmology today .",
    "there is much speculation that the dark matter consists of massive non - standard model elementary particles .",
    "the so - called `` wimps , '' or weakly interacting massive particles , are the best known such candidate .",
    "these are often taken as the lightest supersymmetric particle , with a mass of no more than about @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "any dark matter particle which is a thermal relic can not have a mass of more than about @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that wimps could be captured by the sun @xcite , and that their subsequent annihilations could produce an observable flux of high - energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "recently , another candidate for particle dark matter has been proposed , the `` wimpzilla '' @xcite .",
    "these are gravitationally produced towards the end of inflation by the interaction of the wimpzilla field with the inflating space - time , and in sufficient abundance to be the dark matter .",
    "the wimpzilla is usually not assumed to be coupled to any other fields , although the case of coupling between the wimpzilla and the inflaton has been studied and wimpzilla production still found to be robust @xcite ; inflaton decays have also been shown to be a possible source of supermassive particles @xcite .",
    "the original wimpzilla calculations were done in the context of chaotic inflation ( @xmath6 ) , but they have been shown to be abundantly produced for other inflaton potentials too @xcite .",
    "wimpzillas are most efficiently produced at extremely high masses , on the order of @xmath7 .    a crucial difference between wimps and wimpzillas is that the latter are never in thermal equilibrium , and as such , their masses are not thermodynamically constrained .",
    "it also follows from this that their present - day abundance does not depend on whether they have strong , weak , electromagnetic , or only gravitational interactions ( although there are other considerations which generally rule out charged dark matter @xcite ) .",
    "we assume in this paper that the non - baryonic dark matter consists of wimpzillas with strong interactions , referred to from now on as `` simpzillas . ''",
    "simpzillas , like thermal wimps , can be captured by the sun , and their annihilations in the solar core can produce high - energy neutrinos .",
    "we present the results of a detailed monte carlo calculation simulating the propagation of high - energy neutrinos from simpzilla annihilations through the sun , and also taking oscillations in matter and vacuum into account .",
    "our general conclusion is that the flux of high - energy neutrinos from simpzilla annihilations should be well above background for a broad range of parameter space , and observable by next - generation neutrino detectors such as icecube .",
    "albuquerque , hui and kolb @xcite , henceforth ahk , derived the capture rate of simpzillas by the sun .",
    "the capture of thermal wimps by the sun had previously been studied in @xcite .",
    "ahk assumed that the dark matter consists entirely of simpzillas in a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution , and that the interaction cross section @xmath8 is of the order of the strong force , implying that the sun is many interaction lengths thick .",
    "formulas for the capture rate are given in equations ( 2.5 ) and ( 2.7 ) of their paper .",
    "we plot the capture rate @xmath9 in figure [ gamma_c_fig ] .",
    "the capture rate has two different forms , determined by the efficiency of the simpzilla energy loss in the sun .",
    "once captured by the sun , the simpzillas rapidly fall to the core and annihilate with each other .",
    "ahk showed that equilibrium between annihilation and capture is reached very early in the lifetime of the sun , and would obtain today . in equilibrium , by definition , @xmath10 ( each annihilation destroys two simpzillas ) . note that this has the effect of making the equilibrium value of @xmath11 dependent only on the interaction cross section @xmath8 and not the annihilation cross section @xmath12 .",
    "high - energy neutrinos are produced by the simpzilla annihilations , which produce a quark or gluon pair that then fragment into hadronic jets containing a large number of particles .",
    "ahk used the fragmentation function formalism of @xcite to calculate the numbers of hadrons produced per annihilation . in the dense solar core ,",
    "hadrons composed of light and charmed quarks lose most of their energy before decaying . hadrons with bottom and top quarks , however , have much shorter lifetimes and decay before substantial energy losses .",
    "the neutrinos from these decays are at high energies .    in this paper , as ahk did , we consider the high - energy neutrinos from top hadrons produced in simpzilla annihilations .",
    "although high - energy neutrinos can also come from bottom hadrons , it is generally quite difficult to calculate their flux due to the large number of @xmath13 meson decay modes , the products of which may interact in the sun before themselves decaying . since we find that the neutrino flux from top hadron decays alone",
    "is well above background , including the neutrinos from @xmath13 decays will only add to an already detectable signal , although most of these will be below the @xmath14 cutoff energy we choose .",
    "approximately @xmath15 top hadrons are produced per simpzilla annihilation , where @xmath16 .",
    "top quarks almost always decay in the channel @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 , in turn , decays with equal branching ratios ( each about @xmath19 ) into @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath18 , like the @xmath23 , decays before virtually any energy loss .",
    "when the @xmath22 pair is produced by the @xmath18 decay , the @xmath24 also decays before losing much energy , producing a second @xmath25 .",
    "about @xmath26 of the time , it also produces a second @xmath27 and another @xmath26 of the time a second @xmath28 .",
    "ahk showed that the top hadrons have an energy distribution proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "they also calculated the distribution of the subsequent neutrinos .",
    "the total number of neutrinos produced above @xmath14 from this @xmath30 decay chain is @xmath31    where @xmath32 denotes the neutrino flavor ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , or @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath35 for @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the other two flavors , representing the fact that roughly twice as many @xmath25 are produced per annihilation .",

    "the rest are neutral - current ( nc ) scatterings ; the cross sections for the latter are about one - third of the charged - current scattering cross sections at the same energy .",
    "neutrino - electron scatterings in this energy range are negligible compared to neutrino - nucleon scatterings in the vicinity of the glashow resonance at @xmath41",

    "@xcite , and accordingly we do not consider them in our code .",
    "we have calculated the charged and neutral - current neutrino - nucleon cross sections between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the most recent previous calculations in this energy range @xcite have assumed an isoscalar nucleon ; that is , one in which the quark distribution functions are the average of those for the proton and neutron . this is a good approximation for a medium such as rock ( the calculations were in the context of high - energy neutrino beams propagating through the earth ) .",
    "however , the proton number density in the sun is between two and six times the neutron number density , and the isoscalar approximation does not hold .",
    "we show the ratio of proton and neutron number densities in figure [ np_ratio_fig ] , calculated using the standard solar model of @xcite .",
    "we have used the recently published cteq6-l ( leading order ) parton distribution functions @xcite , together with the deep inelastic scattering formalism of @xcite , to calculate the cross sections . given the energies involved",
    ", we may neglect the electron and muon masses , and so the @xmath27 and @xmath28 cc cross sections are identical .",
    "the @xmath24 mass , however , significantly suppresses the @xmath25 cc cross sections up to about @xmath14 .",
    "although the effect of this on our calculation of the emergent simpzilla neutrino fluxes is minor ( we only consider energies above @xmath14 , and neutrino interactions in the sun are significant only above about @xmath40 ) , we have taken it into account .",
    "the nc cross sections are identical for all three flavors .",
    "we show our results in figures [ cs_cc.e_mu_fig]-[cs_nc_fig ] .",
    "note that for @xmath44 ( and in the case of @xmath25 , above energies where the @xmath24 mass suppression is significant ) , the cross sections are approximately proportional to energy . at higher energies , the rate at which the cross section increases is suppressed by the gauge boson propagator @xcite . however , almost all of the simpzilla neutrino flux is below @xmath45 .",
    "we have also calculated the differential cross sections @xmath46 , where the inelasticity parameter @xmath47 is @xmath48    and @xmath49 is the final charged lepton ( neutrino ) energy in a cc ( nc ) scattering .",

    "our code uses these differential cross sections to obtain probability distributions for @xmath49 .",
    "we find numerically that almost all neutrino interactions take place in the deepest part of the sun , where the density is greatest , out to about @xmath51 .",

    "electrons and muons tend to be stopped by their electromagnetic energy losses .",

    "this phenomenon was first remarked upon by ritz and seckel @xcite in the context of a calculation of neutrino spectra from thermal wimp annihilations in the sun ( see also @xcite ) ; halzen and saltzberg @xcite have shown it to obtain for high - energy neutrino beams propagating through the earth ( see also @xcite ) .    in the absence of oscillations",

    "[ background_threshold_fig ] , we show the excludable region of simpzilla parameter space ; that is , the range of @xmath109 and @xmath8 which would be ruled out by the failure to observe a high - energy neutrino signal coming from the direction of the sun .",
    "even better , of course , would be the observation of such a signal .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis , which we leave to others , would be necessary to rule out other possible sources such as thermal wimps , particularly massive ones that could produce neutrinos in roughly the same energy range .",
    "= 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in",
    "we have shown that the annihilations of simpzillas in the sun should produce a conspicuous high - energy neutrino signal in a @xmath2 ice detector for a fairly large range of simpzilla mass and interaction cross section .",
    "much of this range of parameter space has not yet been ruled out by current observations .",
    "our flux calculation takes all important physical effects into account , including neutrino oscillations , which approximately equalize the fluxes of the different flavors . in calculating the event rates ,",
    "we have made some simplifying assumptions about the detector , and a more realistic calculation ( say , for icecube ) would take the actual detector response characteristics into account .",
    "however , we would not expect this to alter our general conclusion that the simpzilla neutrino signal would be observable in such a detector",
    ".    the next generation of neutrino detectors should be able to either rule out a large range of simpzilla parameter space , or provide observational evidence for them .",
