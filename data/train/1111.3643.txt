    "the distinction between quantum and classical correlations in the state of a multipartite physical system is a fundamental problem with far - reaching implications @xcite .",
    "correlations can be regarded as genuinely classical if they are essentially revealed by classical information theory tools as analogues of correlations between random variables . on the other hand ,",
    "entangled states have been traditionally considered as the only quantum - correlated class of states @xcite , but this statement has recently proven to be misleading .",
    "several features of separable ( i.e. unentangled ) states are incompatible with a purely classical description .",
    "to mention a few , an ensemble of separable nonorthogonal states can not be discriminated perfectly @xcite , general separable states may have off - diagonal coherences in any product basis @xcite , or , more practically , a measurement process on part of a composite system in a separable state may ( and in general does ) induce disturbance on the state of the complementary subsystems @xcite .",
    "these are some genuine signatures of nonclassicality of correlations in the considered states , yet without any entanglement .",
    "a renewed attention towards the properties and the usefulness of such general quantum correlations in separable ( and entangled ) states has been triggered by the observation that , in mixed - state models of quantum computation ( e.g. the so - called dqc1 ) , such general quantum correlations may be at the root of a speed - up compared to classical scenario , despite the presence of zero or nearly vanishing entanglement @xcite . in general , it still remains an open issue whether such general quantum correlations are just related to the statistical properties of a state , or represent truly some stronger , physical correlations of quantum nature that reduce to the entanglement in some cases , and go beyond it in general @xcite .",
    "it is clear that on pure bipartite states of arbitrary quantum systems , entanglement and quantum correlations are just synonyms .",
    "both of them collapse onto the notion of lack of information about the system under scrutiny , when only a subsystem is probed .",
    "quantitatively , this implies that any meaningful measure of entanglement or general quantum correlations should just reduce to some monotonic function of the marginal entropy of each reduced subsystem , when applied to pure bipartite states .",
    "the question becomes significantly more interesting for mixed bipartite states .",
    "one would expect to find , in general , an amount of quantum correlations that is no less than some valid entanglement monotone . in this paper",
    "we prove such an intuition to hold true for a particular choice of quantifiers of entanglement and quantum correlations , on arbitrary two - qubit states and on a relevant subclass of two - qudit states .",
    "we recall that , in the last decade , a zoo of entanglement measures ( say @xmath4 the amount of entanglement they aim to quantify ) have been introduced @xcite , and in a more recent drift several measures have been proposed as well to evaluate the degree of general quantum correlations ( say @xmath5 ) in composite systems @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that @xmath6 should hold for a _ bona fide _ chosen pair of quantifiers ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , this claim turns out to be not mathematically fulfilled in some canonical cases . selecting for instance two well - established entropic quantifiers such as the `` entanglement of formation '' @xcite as an entanglement monotone , and the `` quantum discord '' @xcite as a measure of quantum correlations",
    ", one finds that the latter can be greater as well as smaller than the former depending on the states , and no clear hierarchy can be established , even in the simple cases of two - qubit systems @xcite or two - mode gaussian states @xcite .",
    "an interesting study has recently succeeded in describing entanglement , classical and quantum correlations under a unified geometric picture @xcite , by quantifying each type of correlations in terms of the smallest distance ( according to the relative entropy ) from the corresponding set of states without that type of correlations .",
    "for example , the amount of entanglement in a state @xmath7 is given by the relative - entropic distance between @xmath7 and its closest separable state , and it is called relative entropy of entanglement @xcite . in this context ,",
    "our expectation holds : the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath8 is automatically smaller in general than the so - called relative entropy of quantumness @xmath9 @xcite , which in turn quantifies the minimum relative entropic - distance from the set of purely classically correlated states ( a null - measure subset of the convex set of separable states @xcite ) .",
    "the latter measure @xmath9 has been recently interpreted operationally within an ` activation ' framework that recognizes the value of general quantum correlations as resources to generate entanglement with an ancillary system @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "such a protocol is sufficiently general to let one define , in a natural way , quantumness measures @xmath10 associated to any proper entanglement monotone @xmath4 . in this way",
    "the question of the validity of eq .",
    "( [ equestion ] ) becomes especially meaningful given the natural compatibility of the involved quantifiers @xcite .",
    "however , there is a nontrivial optimization step required for the calculation of each @xmath10 that hinders the explicit computability of the desired resources .    in this paper",
    ", we choose _ computable _ measures for entanglement and general quantum correlations . in the case of entanglement , we adopt the squared `` negativity '' @xmath11 @xcite , which is a measure of abstract algebraic origin , quantifying how much a bipartite state fails to satisfy the positivity of partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion for separability introduced by peres and the horodeckis @xcite . in the case of quantum correlations , we pick the `` geometric quantum discord '' @xmath1 @xcite , which measures ( as suggested by the name ) the minimum distance of a state from the set of classically correlated states , in terms of the squared hilbert  schmidt norm . both measures are taken to be normalized between @xmath12 and @xmath13 . despite the very different origin and nature of these two measures , we prove that eq .",
    "( [ equestion ] ) holds , namely @xmath2 , for arbitrary mixed states of two qubits .",
    "we remark that both measures play key roles in the quantum correlation scenario , especially for their observability and usefulness in quantum information applications .",
    "in fact , the negativity is a popular entanglement measure , operationally related to the entanglement cost under ppt preserving operations @xcite , and amenable of experimental estimation via quantitative entanglement witnesses ( which provide measurable lower bounds to @xmath0 ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometric discord , operationally interpreted in @xcite , also admits a tight lower bound @xmath14 @xcite ( which is by itself a faithful , observable quantifier of general quantum correlations ) , whose detection  not requiring complete state tomography  currently constitutes the optimal pathway to reveal and quantitatively estimate nonclassical correlations in quantum algorithms such as dqc1 mixed - state quantum computation @xcite . in this respect , we show specifically that the chain @xmath15 holds on general two - qubit states ( where the leftmost inequality is analytical @xcite and the rightmost one is corroborated by numerical simulations ) .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the inequality @xmath2 extends to arbitrary pure , werner @xcite and isotropic states @xcite of two qudits for any higher dimension @xmath3 .",
    "we further provide numerical evidence that supports the validity of the inequality also in generic states of @xmath16 systems .",
    "we then conjecture that @xmath2 should hold for arbitrary mixed states of @xmath17 bipartite system .",
    "our results demonstrate an interesting hierarchy between two apparently unrelated quantifiers of nonclassicality , for both of which closed formulas ( and experimentally friendly detection schemes ) are available on the classes of states considered here .",
    "the fact that the geometric discord stands as a sharp upper bound on a computable measure of entanglement such as the ( squared ) negativity , is a worthwhile issue to impose a rigorous ordering of resources , for all those applications where the performance of a quantum information and communication primitive relies on the amount and the nature of nonclassical correlations between the involved parties @xcite .",

    ", we found that the hierarchy between geometric discord and squared negativity still holds rigorously .",
    "we characterized the states with minimal @xmath1 at fixed @xmath11 : they present an elegant parametrization of the distribution of their schmidt coefficients , allowing to express analytically the lower bound in the @xmath1 vs @xmath11 plane for any @xmath3 as in eq .",
    "( [ lboundd ] ) . in the mixed - state case , the inequality is still valid for werner and isotropic @xmath25 states , for which @xmath1 is a simple function of the negativity for each dimension @xmath3 .",
    "we further provided numerical evidence supporting the validity of the hierarchy between geometric discord and squared negativity for general mixed states of @xmath16 systems .",
    "in all the instances analyzed in this paper , @xmath1 and @xmath0 were computable in closed form , and were always found to obey the ordering relationship @xmath2 .",

    "geometric discord @xcite ( or its lower bound @xmath14 @xcite ) and negativity @xcite are two computable , observable and experimentally friendly measures of quantum correlations whose interplay , explored in this paper , is important to get a quantitative grip on the performance of several quantum information protocols , ranging from quantum computation to quantum metrology and state discrimination @xcite . understanding the nature of nonclassical correlations and their role in determining advantages over fully classical scenarios is a central issue in quantum information processing and communication @xcite . on a more fundamental level , our findings suggest that nonclassical correlations measured by geometric discord could be regarded as a more general feature that somehow incorporates entanglement and state mixedness , following the intuition advanced in @xcite . encouraging preliminary evidence that ( the lower bound @xmath14 to ) the geometric discord can be employed to characterize the dynamics of quantum correlations in open systems , and possibly other relevant features of open systems themselves ( e.g. non - markovianity @xcite ) , has been recently presented in @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the ordering relations we found suggest that entanglement and general quantum correlations as well can be both interrelated to such properties of open systems .",
    "encouraged by the hierarchy pointed out in this paper , we believe it becomes even more meaningful to keep searching for simple but universal , physically motivated and mathematically accessible , unifying measures of `` quantumness '' of the correlations , along the spirit of refs .",
