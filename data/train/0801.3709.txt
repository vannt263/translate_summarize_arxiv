    "the modelling of individual globular clusters has a long history ( see @xcite , especially   3 and 7.7 ) .",
    "much of the focus of this work is on static models such as the king model and its variants . in this kind of modelling the dynamical history of the cluster is almost irrelevant , except for the general assumption that the cluster is almost relaxed .",
    "by contrast , there have been a small number of studies based on techniques which can follow the dynamical evolution of a cluster .",
    "most of this work has been performed with a fokker - planck scheme using finite differences , but also there are examples of the use of fluid and monte carlo methods ( tab . [",
    "table : history ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : new_m67 ]    l10  stars with mass above @xmath1 , burning nuclear fuel and contained within 10 pc    @xmath2 model with different initial realisation of the sequence of random numbers .",
    "all other model parameters are the same as for the model above .    for the purpose of the following comparison with the monte carlo simulations , we shall focus on the surface density profile given in @xcite , corrected as above for the background stars .",
    "clearly , the models show reasonably good agreement with the observations ( see figs [ fig : m67_2000.1 ] - [ fig : m67_2001.3 ] ( top panel ) ) .",
    "use of the corrected observational data brings the surface density profile for the large radii into much better agreement with the simulations ( see for comparison fig .",
    "[ fig : m67_sd ] ) .",
    "the special treatment of the tide in the monte carlo model plays only a minor role : the effective tidal radius , @xmath3 , is only reduced by about @xmath4 in comparison to the true tidal radius , @xmath5 .",
    "it seems that , despite the large latitude of m67 , the contamination of the observed surface density profile by background stars plays an important role , at large radii .",
    "the comparison between the luminosity functions from the monte carlo models and observations is given in the same figures as for the surface density profiles .",
    "the luminosity functions are in reasonable agreement with observations , except that the modelled luminosity function has an excess for @xmath6 mag , in comparison with observations .",
    "of course there are also noticeable differences for the high - luminosity end connected with the relative lack of blue stragglers in the monte carlo models .",
    "it could be argued that the excess of low - luminosity stars can not be explained by supposing that not all low - mass stars are observed , because the observational field of m67 is high - latitude , not heavily contaminated and sparse , and so all stars with @xmath7 mag should be observed . on the other hand",
    "the authors themselves @xcite declared that the determination of the luminosity function `` is a difficult procedure because of the presence of background stars '' .",
    "their background correction has been applied in the observational data shown in these figures , and they did it in the following way .",
    "the background was estimated by counting stars in an area of the colour - magnitude diagram just blue of the main sequence , and equal in area to the assumed boundaries of the main sequence .",
    "but photometric errors in the colours rise abruptly by @xmath8 , and the resulting spread in the main sequence is very evident below @xmath9 . if the result is that main sequence stars spread into the area in which field stars are counted , then the derived ( observed ) luminosity function will be too small .",
    "because of the difficulty in quantifying this effect , we should consider whether there are dynamical processes , omitted from the models , which could also account for the mismatch at the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "the difference in the luminosity functions for @xmath6 mag suggests some mechanism by which the open cluster m67 very efficiently removed a substantial fraction of low mass stars ( @xmath10 ) during its evolution .",
    "there are two possibilities :    1 .",
    "- removal of residual gas during the first few million years in a cluster with primordial mass segregation .",
    "the resulting expansion would lead to preferential removal of low mass stars .",
    "2 .   - interactions with the galactic disk and bulge can produce tidal shocks which in turn again preferentially removes low mass stars @xcite .",
    "these effects would , of course , alter the entire history of mass - loss in the models , and require more massive initial models .    finally , we checked the influence of statistical fluctuations , which are intrinsic to the monte carlo method , on the determination of the initial cluster parameters which we have inferred from the comparison with observations .",
    "to assess the scale of this effect , the same model was repeated with different statistical realisations of the initial model , ( i.e. different initial seeds ( iseed ) for the sequence of random numbers ) .",
    "typical results are presented in figs . [",
    "fig : m67_2000.7 ] ( model iii ) and [ fig : m67_2000.7 - 20 ] ( model iv ) .",
    "it is clear that the use of different realisations of the initial model has a large impact on the observational properties of the cluster at time 4 gyr .",
    "the good agreement for the surface density profile within the half - mass radius of the cluster is totally destroyed : the new model ( iseed = 20 ) has a much higher central surface density , by factor of about 3 .",
    "also the luminosity function for model iv shows poorer agreement with the observations than model iii : there are many more low - mass main sequence stars than in model iii . as can be seen in the tab .",
    "[ table : new_m67 ] the model with iseed = 20 is less advanced in its dynamical evolution .",
    "it has larger total mass and half - mass radius , and a smaller binary fraction . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m67_2000.7 - 20 ] , at time 4.5 gyr the model gives similar results to model iii .",
    "just because of the different statistical realisation of the initial conditions , model iv has smaller average mass than model iii , and consequently smaller mass loss due to stellar evolution and a correspondingly smaller cluster expansion .",
    "the difference between the average masses is only about 4% , but it seems that this is enough to change the rate of cluster evolution substantially .",
    "this conclusion is supported by hurley s",
    "findings @xcite that the incidental formation of a massive binary can totally change the observational properties of the cluster .",
    "in this paper we have presented an advanced monte carlo code for the evolution of rich star clusters , including most aspects of dynamical interactions involving binary and single stars , and the internal evolution of single and binary stars .",
    "it was shown that the free parameters of the monte carlo code can be successfully calibrated against results of small @xmath0-body simulations and simulations of the old open cluster m67 .",
    "sec.[sec : refinement ] described our best models of m67 .",
    "the results show that an equally good fit to the observational data can be achieved by models which differ substantially in some initial parameters , such as the slope of the imf .",
    "by contrast it seems that the other parameters are better constrained , at least within the ensemble of models which we studied .",
    "actually , none of the models can successfully fit all the observational properties of m67 that we have studied , but we have argued that the remaining mismatches can be understood in terms of known characteristics of the monte carlo method , or the observational problem of subtracting the background .",
    "these difficulties are especially pronounced at the bright and faint ends of the luminosity function .",
    "the most satisfactory models are characterised by the following initial parameters : @xmath0 about 30000 , @xmath5 about 33 pc , @xmath11 about 50% and @xmath12 about 10 .",
    "the word `` about '' is used deliberately , because of the large effect of statistical fluctuations in such small systems .",
    "it is worth noting that a satisfactory fit can be achieved for a large range of values of the power - law index of the imf for low mass stars , though it seems that values of @xmath13 in the range 0.5  0.7 give slightly better agreement with observations .",
    "finally , these monte carlo simulations clearly show the strong influence of statistical fluctuations on the observational properties of a cluster . in consequence",
    "it seems that recovery of the initial cluster parameters from a comparison between numerical models and observations may be very difficult or even impossible , particularly for models with low or moderate @xmath0 .",
    "more observational data is needed to constrain the models better , but the data on such properties as the number of particular kinds of binaries , pulsars or blue stragglers seem to provide only very weak constraints .    despite these successes in fitting @xmath0-body models and the open cluster m67 , the code has some known shortcomings , which we summarise here .    1",
    ".   _ cross sections _ :",
    "it has become apparent @xcite that the use of cross sections can lead to some systematic errors in the evolution of core parameters and other quantities . within the context of the monte carlo code we are working on , it is known how to replace these by explicit numerical calculation of the interactions @xcite , and this will be our next improvement .",
    "one side effect of the current absence of explicit interactions is that we do not yet model collisions which occur during them ; therefore one channel for the formation of blue stragglers is missing from these simulations .",
    "2 .   _ higher - order multiples _ : it is widely argued that primordial triples and higher multiples should be incorporated into simulations along with primordial binaries . in any case , hierarchical triples form abundantly in binary - binary interactions @xcite .",
    "such higher - order multiples are ignored in the present monte - carlo code , as cross sections for interactions with other objects have not yet been devised .",
    "hierarchical triples and higher - order multiples can be introduced as new species when explicit calculation of interactions has been incorporated .",
    "3 .   _ escape _ : the monte carlo code described here incorporates a tidal cutoff , and a simple modification based on the theory devised by @xcite .",
    "other treatments are possible and worth trying .",
    "rotation _ : the monte carlo code is based on spherical symmetry , and would require rather fundamental and very difficult reconstruction in order to cope with cluster rotation . as was pointed out by @xcite the rotation only somewhat accelerates the rate of core collapse .",
    "_ static tide _ : the effect of tidal shocks have been extensively studied ( e.g. @xcite ) and it would be possible to add the effects as another process altering the energies and angular momenta of the stars in the simulations",
    ". the addition of tidal shocks will be more important when modelling galactic globular clusters than open clusters , which usually are confined inside the galactic disk .    despite these limitations , some of which are difficult to cure",
    ", the monte carlo model presented in this paper shows its potential power in simulations of star clusters , from open clusters to rich globular clusters .",
    "monte carlo models are feasible in a reasonable time ( a week or so ) for globular clusters , which are too large for direct @xmath0-body models , and future papers in this series will present results on m4 and several other globular clusters .",
    "the data provided by monte carlo simulations are as detailed as those provided by an @xmath0-body code .",
    "no available simulation methods , except monte carlo and @xmath0-body methods , can really provide that kind of comprehensive information . even when @xmath0-body simulations eventually become possible",
    ", monte carlo models will remain as a quicker way of exploring the parameter space for the large scale @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "this research was supported in part by the polish national committee for scientific research under grant 1 p03d 002 27 .",
    "dch warmly thanks mg for his hospitality during a visit to warsaw which greatly facilitated his contribution to this project .",
    "mg warmly thanks dch for his hospitality during visits to edinburgh which gave a boost to the project .",
    "mg also warmly thanks janusz kaluzny for very stimulating discussions about the quality of the observational data ."
