    "elliptical galaxies have often been viewed as old , uniform systems , with little gas , dust and activity . through the years",
    ", ground - based and especially high spatial resolution imaging studies with the @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) have rapidly changed that view @xcite .",
    "based on these surveys , early - type galaxies are now known to commonly contain large amount of dust in various forms and sometimes complex structures . of particular interest",
    "are the small ( @xmath5 , 200 pc ) dusty nuclear disks that have been found in the centers of elliptical galaxies ( see review by ford et al .",
    "their discovery and the ionized gas disks , associated with the dust , opened up a new means of efficiently measuring the central mass potentials , possibly of supermassive black holes ( bh ) , residing in the centers of galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we conduct a survey of two large samples of elliptical galaxies to study their dust properties and how they are related to other global properties of the parent galaxies as a whole .",
    "the main sample consists of e or s0 galaxies from the lyon / meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) , selected to be nearby with @xmath6 3400 km s@xmath7 , and lying at galactic latitude @xmath8 20  to minimize galactic extinction .",
    "details of the sample selection and morphological and photometric properties of the galaxies are described in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "a total of 130 galaxies meet our criteria , out of which 67 galaxies were observed by @xmath4 using wfpc2 in snapshot mode with the f702w filter ( @xmath9 band ) .",
    "we shall refer to this sample as the `` snapshot '' sample in the rest of the paper .    in order to better assess the results derived from the snapshot sample",
    ", we also discuss where relevant a sample of galaxies selected for their 100 @xmath2 m @xmath1 emission .",
    "the rational is that these galaxies are selected for their higher far - ir ( 60 and 100 @xmath2 m ) emission , and thus are probably more likely to contain large amount of dust .",
    "the selection criteria are similar to those of the snapshot sample except that the galaxies are drawn from the @xmath4 archive , and with the additional criterion that a 100 @xmath2 m @xmath1 detection exist with @xmath10 significance .",
    "a total of 40 galaxies with @xmath4/wfpc2 images was collected from the @xmath4 archive , and examined .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this sample as the `` iras '' sample .",
    "our goal is to provide a reliable assessment of the frequency of dust and dusty disks in early - type galaxies and how their morphology , amount , and dynamics relate to the activity and other characteristics of the host galaxies .",
    "the main strength of our snapshot study is the large and unbiased sample of galaxies , all imaged at similar high resolution .",
    "this will allow us to make reliable statistical statements regarding their dust properties .",
    "ultimately , we wish to use those with dusty nuclear disks as a probe of the central bh masses , and study how they are related to their environment .",
    "for consistency with paper i , we use @xmath11 = 80 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7  throughout the paper .",
    "some general properties of galaxies in the snapshot sample are listed in table [ gentab ] .",
    "paper i describes the observations and reduction of the images .",
    "we now describe our analysis of the galaxies with dust .",
    "paper i reports the detection of dust in 29 galaxies , or 43% of the snapshot sample ( the method of dust detection is outlined below ) .",
    "this is generally comparable to those reported by previous studies of early - type galaxies , which have shown the following detection rates of dust : @xcite:@xmath3 40% ; @xcite : 23% ; @xcite : 41% ; @xcite : 48% ; @xcite : @xmath3 75% ;",
    "@xcite : 56% .",
    "the large variation in the dust detection rates among different studies may be due to the different methods of counting detections , or the different resolutions and sensitivities of the observations .",
    "the ground - based ccd study of @xcite , for example , includes only dust at the level of @xmath12 @xmath13 , effectively missing all the small nuclear dust disks , resulting in an abnormally low detection rate .",
    "the relatively high detection rate of @xcite , on the other hand , may be due to higher sensitivity and lower detection threshold .",
    "also , we note that the 85% dust detection rate found by @xcite for galaxies in the virgo cluster is considerably higher than those mentioned above .",
    "the reason for this is because they included galaxies with weakly distorted isophotes , in which the presence of dust was not directly visible by eye . in several cases , it later turned out that these distortions were not due to dust , but rather to defects in the ccd chips ( so called `` measles '' ) . van den bosch et al .",
    "( 1994 ) detected dust `` by eye '' in 5 out of 14 galaxies ( 36% ) , which is in good agreement with other studies .",
    "for our sample , the morphology of the dust is grouped into two broad categories : filamentary and disky .",
    "of these systems , 17 have only filamentary dust with no disks , 9 have well - defined dusty disks , and 3 show dust lying not only in a disk - like morphology but also in widespread extended filaments .",
    "see table [ jdust ] for a summary of the dust morphology found in the sample . in paper",
    "i , the level of filamentary dust is described in a purely qualitative way , with the simple scale i , ii or iii being assigned to denote the least to most dusty galaxies through visual inspection only .",
    "class i represents small traces of dust that do not greatly affect the isophotal shape of the galaxy ; class ii and iii denote large amounts of dust that prevent a meaningful analysis of the isophotes and luminosity profiles .",
    "figures [ ddisk ] and [ fdust ] show examples of some of the galaxies with dusty disks and filaments . in this paper , we follow @xcite and @xcite to estimate the mass of the dust present in each system .",
    "the dust mass is given by : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mean visual extinction in magnitudes , @xmath16 is the surface area covered by the dust , and @xmath17 is the extinction coefficient per unit mass .",
    "we adopt @xmath18 mag kpc@xmath19 @xmath13@xmath7 @xcite .    to obtain @xmath15 , we first determine the optical depth from the ratio of the calibrated image to the model of its surface brightness generated from an isophotal elliptical fit , using the iraf task `` ellipse '' with the dusty features masked out .",
    "the optical depth in @xmath9 is then @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the observed flux and @xmath22 is the modeled flux , and @xmath23 . assuming a galactic extinction law with @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "in determining the mean visual extinction , we include all areas where @xmath26 , which is the minimum detectable @xmath27 . along with the estimated mass of the visible dust , table [ jdust ] lists the morphologies of the dust features , the mean visual absorption , the position angle ( pa ) of the major axis of the dust feature , and the pa of the galaxy major axis .",
    "table [ jdust ] shows that the range of dust mass values for our sample is comparable to that obtained by @xcite and @xcite , typically 10@xmath2810@xmath29 @xmath13 as the dust mass , with @xmath30 . ] . in table",
    "[ mdcomp ] , we show a comparison of the optically derived gas mass estimated by our study with those of previous works . for consistency , we consider only results obtained from similar @xmath4 observations by @xcite and @xcite",
    ". a gas - to - dust ratio of 130 is assumed for our study , and previous mass values have been converted using distances listed in table [ gentab ] .",
    "although the number of objects in common between these studies are small , the mass estimates are in reasonable good agreement , given the uncertainty of @xmath3 0.5 in logarithmic scale @xcite typical for this type of dust mass determination .",
    "the agreement appears better with @xcite , who used the same method as our study , than with @xcite , who used color excess , giving mass values that are a few times to one order of magnitude larger than ours .",
    "note that the dust mass estimated above relies on the simple assumption of a foreground screen in front of a background light .",
    "any dust embedded within the galaxies or intermixed with stars can not be estimated by this method .",
    "for example , using radiative transfer calculations , including scattering of photons into the line of sight , @xcite have found that the mass estimated for the dusty disk in ngc 4261 is about one order of magnitude greater than that inferred from a foreground screen model .",
    "furthermore , since we are fitting directly to the observed light , and it is impossible to mask out all faint dust features , we do not have a perfect model of the true underlying light .",
    "thus the derived masses listed in table [ jdust ] are always _ lower _ limits to the true mass .",
    "some of the missing non - clumpy , diffuse dust could be detected through its far - infrared radiation .",
    "this is confirmed by our estimates of the dust mass from the @xmath1 flux densities @xmath31 . following @xcite ,",
    "the dust mass is estimated from the @xmath1 flux through the formula : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath1 flux density in mjy , @xmath34 is distance in mpc , and @xmath35 is in @xmath2 m .",
    "the dust temperature @xmath36 is estimated from the color ratio @xmath37 , according to the prescription of @xcite , using an emissivity law that varies as @xmath38 .",
    "for those galaxies where the color ratio @xmath37 is not available , a representative color temperature of @xmath39 k is assumed .",
    "we caution that the @xmath1 dust mass is very sensitive to such assumed parameters as grain size and temperature .",
    "table [ jrir ] lists the radio and @xmath1 fluxes for those galaxies detected in the sample .",
    "the radio 1400 mhz flux densities are derived from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the @xmath1 fluxes are taken from @xcite , except for eso 437 - 15 , eso 447 - 30 , eso 580 - 26 , and ngc 2824 , which are not included in their sample . for these galaxies , we measured their flux densities from the data scans by using the * apphot * package in iraf and comparing the results to values in the @xmath40 to derive scaling factors , which are similar to those of @xcite .",
    "as figure [ mdoir ] shows , for those galaxies with both @xmath1 detections and visibly detectable dust , the dust masses estimated from the @xmath1 fluxes , listed in table [ jrir ] , are @xmath3 14 orders of magnitude greater than those derived from optical depth measurements of visual dust structures .",
    "this is consistent with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "although the optically derived dust mass , @xmath41 , always underestimates the true dust mass , we choose to use it in our analysis , since the @xmath1 derived dust mass , @xmath31 is unsuitable for any analysis relating to the far - ir properties .",
    "if derived in a consistent manner for the whole sample , @xmath41 should be a reliable representation of the dust mass .",
    "moreover , some galaxies have no @xmath1 detections and yet dust is detected visually ( see below ) . presumably , most of the dust in these objects may be too cold ( @xmath42 20 k ) to be detected by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "figures [ irall ] and [ nvss ] show the scatter plots of various properties of the snapshot sample galaxies versus dust mass . table [ rtab ] summarizes the correlation coefficients for these plots . as can be seen , both the 60@xmath2 m and 100@xmath2 m luminosities are significantly correlated with dust mass .",
    "furthermore , the correlation becomes stronger when the few systems with dusty disks are excluded .",
    "the only outliner is ngc 3065 whose ir fluxes are suspected to be contaminated with emission from ngc 3066 , 3  away @xcite .",
    "this source is excluded from our statistical analysis .",
    "as figure [ irall ] and table [ rtab ] also show , there appears to be no significant correlation between @xmath1 luminosities and absolute blue magnitudes of these galaxies . turning to the radio property , figure",
    "[ nvss ] and table [ rtab ] show that the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity is also seen to follow a weak , but significant relationship with dust mass .",
    "however , in this case , the radio luminosity is also correlated with the optical luminosity of the galaxies , in agreement with calvani , fasano , & franceschini ( 1989 ) .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath43 ",
    "@xmath44 correlation may be largely a secondary effect of a more fundamental relationship between optical luminosity ( and thus mass ) and radio luminosity of the galaxy .    if one considers the radio detection rate , not constrained solely to those galaxies found to have dust , the correspondence of radio - emitting sources to the presence of dust is much stronger .",
    "figure [ pdet ] and table [ drate ] present the detection rates of various properties for both the snapshot and @xmath1 samples . in the snapshot sample ,",
    "only 8% of the galaxies without dust have radio detection , while 66% of the galaxies with dust do .",
    "similarly , of the 26 galaxies in the snapshot sample with @xmath1 100 @xmath2 m detection , most ( 58% ) are associated with dusty galaxies , a great majority of which are filamentary ( table [ drate ] ) .",
    "since the galaxies are selected to be nearby ( @xmath42 40 mpc ) , any distance effects are likely to be small .",
    "the overall rate of @xmath1 detection in the snapshot sample is 42% , consistent with those reported by @xcite for e and s0 galaxies .    turning to the @xmath1 sample listed in table",
    "[ irastab ] , about 3/4 ( 78% ) of the galaxies contain dust ( i.e. , detection by eye from @xmath4 images ) of some type , compared to only 43% for the snapshot sample . since the @xmath1 sample is specifically selected for the detection of 100 @xmath2 m emission , this suggests that the far - ir radiation largely arises from dust embedded throughout the galaxy .    as figure",
    "[ dustmb ] shows , there appears to be no correlation between the derived dust mass and absolute blue magnitude .",
    "this result is consistent with that of @xcite and @xcite but disagrees with @xcite and @xcite . at first sight , this seems to suggest that there is little causal connection between the dust and the existing stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "however , if only the 12 galaxies with dusty disks are examined ( open circles in fig .",
    "[ dustmb ] ) , a clear relationship is evident between the dust mass and blue luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "the correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is highly significant , with a spearman rank coefficient of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for comparison . ] .",
    "ngc 4233 is an outliner , reducing the the significance of the correlation . excluding ngc 4233",
    "improves the correlation coefficient to @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the mass of the central bh in early type galaxies has been shown to be correlated with the bulge luminosity ( and hence its mass ; e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; van der marel 1999 ) .",
    "very recently , a much tighter correspondence has been shown between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the galaxy @xcite . in figure [ mdsizesig ]",
    "we show plots of the mass and diameter of the dusty disks versus the central velocity dispersion @xmath51 for both galaxies in the snapshot and @xmath1 samples .",
    "@xmath51 is the velocity dispersion taken from @xcite and @xcite , and we have used distances derived from surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ; e.g. , neilsen & tsvetanov 2000 ) wherever possible .",
    "there appears to be a weak tendency for larger disks with higher dust mass to show higher velocity dispersion .",
    "however , the diagrams contain considerable scatters , and any correlation is very weak at best .",
    "notable are the apparent `` zones of avoidance '' in the upper left and lower right areas of the graphs .",
    "a formal test shows that the @xmath45 vs. @xmath51 plot has a correlation coefficient of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 = 0.035 $ ] ) .",
    "interestingly , in the disk size vs. @xmath51 diagram , the correlation seems to apply only for those galaxies whose dust disk diameter is @xmath42 400 pc . those galaxies with very extended `` disks '' , or more like lanes , such as ngc 5128 ( cen a ) , ngc 4697 , ngc 4233 , ngc 6861 and eso 208 - 21 lie well above the trend line . discarding these from the analysis , statistical test shows that the correlation has a coefficient of @xmath54 ( @xmath53 = 0.022 $ ] ) .",
    "if the correlation is real , it is interesting to speculate on the cause and implications of such a relationship .",
    "the more luminous galaxies with larger mass may be expected to contain more dust .",
    "indeed , there is a strong relationship between dust mass and absolute magnitude for those galaxies with dusty disks ( fig .",
    "[ dustmb ] ) . the loose correlations between the disk size / mass and @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ mdsizesig ] ) could be a direct consequence of a correlation between galaxy mass and @xmath51 , which has long been documented @xcite .",
    "the remarkable sharpness of the disks detected ( fig .",
    "[ ddisk ] ) is also highly suggestive of some physical mechanism that acts to limit the size and shape of these disks .",
    "if so , the disk size / mass  @xmath51 relation indicates that such process is ultimately governed by the mass of the central bh .",
    "clues to the origin of the dust can be glimpsed from a comparison of the pa between the major axis of the dust features and that of the galaxy .",
    "the isophotal pa of the galaxy s major axis is measured at 10 , and listed in table [ jdust ] .",
    "table [ jdust ] also lists the pa difference @xmath55 between the two major axes .",
    "figure [ padiff ] displays a distribution of the pa difference . as can be seen , the dusty nuclear disks have a high tendency to be aligned with the major axis of the host galaxies , nearly all within 10 , while the filamentary dust structures show a much lower tendency to align with their hosts .",
    "the former result is in agreement with that of @xcite for a sample of dusty disks in nearby 3cr elliptical galaxies .",
    "the median @xmath56 for the dusty disks and filamentary dust are 5  and 23 , respectively .",
    "a k - s test confirms that the @xmath56 distributions are significantly different , with only a 0.7% probability that they are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "this may suggest different origins for the disky and filamentary dust : internal for the dusty disk and external for filamentary dust .",
    "the presence of a correlation in figure [ dustmb ] for dusty disks but not for filamentary dust also seems to corroborate this .",
    "however , if both types of dust have a common origin , the most likely interpretation is that the dust comes from the outside and requires time to settle into well - organized disks .",
    "again , the outliner is ngc 4233 , which is the only galaxy with dusty `` disk '' that does show a misalignment ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this galaxy , however , happens to have very extended double dust lanes , rather than the more typical compact nuclear disk , perhaps suggesting that the dust has been acquired more recently and is still in the process of settling into a compact nuclear disk .    for those galaxies that have filamentary dust ,",
    "the acquired dust has not yet had sufficient time to relax and achieve equilibrium in a `` settled state '' .",
    "if the dust had arisen internally we would have expected a general alignment with the major dynamical axis of the galaxy .",
    "our finding is consistent with that of @xcite , who found a kinematic misalignment between the stars and the dust in a sample of early - type galaxies , suggesting that the two are not kinematically coupled , and thus have different origins . in a study of a sample of radio - loud active galaxies ( the 3cr sample ) , @xcite also find the dust in various forms similar to those seen here , and they suggest that these are also probably reflective of their different dynamical states .",
    "previous studies have reached similar conclusion that the dust is external in origin @xcite .",
    "if the dust originated in a merger of two gas - rich disk galaxies ( barnes & hernquist 1996 , 1998 ) , one might expect that the stars have not fully reached equilibrium either .",
    "however , no evidence for recent merger activity has been found in stars , even in the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "this may suggest that the dust could arise from the tidal capture of gas from an encounter with a nearby galaxy . as a simple test of this hypothesis we have looked for any correlation between the amount of dust and local environment density of the galaxies in the snapshot sample .",
    "the group membership is taken from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and are listed in table [ gentab ] . as a rough measure of the size of the group we have also considered the group harmonic radius taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is defined as @xmath58^{-1 } \\}$ ] , where @xmath59 is the mean velocity of the group , @xmath60 is the number of group members , and @xmath61 is the angular separation of the @xmath62th and @xmath63th group members .",
    "we show in figure [ group ] the scatter plots of @xmath64 versus @xmath60 , @xmath65 , and the number density of the group defined as @xmath66 .",
    "as can be seen , there appears to be no correlation between the dust mass with any of these quantities .    as table",
    "[ drate ] and figure [ pdet ] also show , there is virtually no difference between the extra - galactic environment of the two types of galaxies : dusty galaxies are no more likely to be found in groups or having close companions than dustless galaxies .",
    "these tests , therefore , fail to support an external origin for the dust .",
    "however , given other evidence for an external origin from this and previous studies , it may be possible for the dust to either be captured sufficiently long ago that no signs of mergers or interactions are currently evident , or be acquired more recently but has an efficient way of losing angular momentum quickly .",
    "as shown by tohline , simonson , & caldwell ( 1982 ) and @xcite , the timescale that dissipative differential precession causes gas entering an elliptical galaxy to settle in a disk is fairly short ( @xmath67 yrs ) .",
    "we note that an external origin , coupled with the @xmath56 distribution in figure [ padiff ] , also suggests that elliptical galaxies are predominantly oblate @xcite .",
    "the external or internal origin of the dust could be confirmed with a systematic spectroscopic study of a large and well - defined sample of galaxies with dust , such as that of the present study , to examine the dynamics and sense of rotation of the stars and gas .",
    "if approximately half of the disks are counter - rotating with respect to the stars , the dust most likely has an external origin .",
    "such counter - rotating disks have been observed in a number of galaxies @xcite , with a higher incidence in early - type galaxies @xcite , providing support for the idea that these disks are products of galaxy interactions or mergers .",
    "it has been shown that the presence of dust is closely associated with ionized gas in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the presence of ionized gas alone , however , does not establish the object as being a _ bona fide _ active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , with the excitation of the gas provided by photoionization from a central nonthermal continuum . because active star forming regions are often associated with dust , in some of these systems",
    ", the gas ionization probably comes from circumnuclear starburst or high - velocity shocks and not a true active nucleus ( i.e , gas - fed bh ) , although many are found to be liners ( table [ gentab ] ; many of which are believed to be low - luminosity agns ) . for the purpose of the following discussion",
    ", we shall take the presence of any emission line as a sign of galaxy activity .",
    "we wish to see if ionized gas indicative of galactic activity is more reflective of not only dust , but dust in a small nuclear disk .",
    "that is , is it more likely for a galaxy to show emission lines when a dusty disk is present than when dust is filamentary in form or no dust is seen ? it is natural to expect galaxies with dusty nuclear disks to show some level of nuclear activity because there is an ample gas supply from the disk to feed the central massive bh , if it is present .",
    "furthermore , the closer the dust is to the nucleus , the more likely the connection is to the activity . to answer this question ,",
    "we have searched the literature for observations of any line emission in the snapshot sample .",
    "table [ gentab ] summarizes our results .",
    "of the 67 galaxies in our snapshot sample , we found 43 with published observations establishing whether or not ionized gas is present .",
    "our search indicates that 19 ( 86% ) of the dusty galaxies do show line - emitting gas , compared to only 6 ( 28% ) of the dustless galaxies .",
    "as  [ dustm ] shows , however , if no dust is visually detected , it may not mean that it is truly free of dust ; the dust could be in a diffuse , non - clumpy form that is not visibly apparent .",
    "figure [ pdet ] indicates that the presence of line - emitting gas does not show any preference for galaxies with dust in the form of a small disk , or extended clumps / filaments .",
    "in fact , the incidence of emission lines is virtually identical ( @xmath3 87% ) between the two groups .",
    "this indicates that emission line activity does show a strong preference for galaxies with _ visibly detectable _ dust , consistent with the finding by @xcite and @xcite , but not necessarily in small nuclear disky form .",
    "taken as a whole , emission lines occur in about 58% of the snapshot sample galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who found that the detection rate for emission line in e and s0 galaxies in a large , complete sample of nearby galaxies is 60% .",
    "while most of the dusty disk galaxies in our sample have ionized gas , we have found at least a few without any signs of line emission ( e.g. , ngc 4406 , ngc 4648 ) . while this may indicate that the emission level is below the detection limit of the surveys , how the fuel is being fed to the central bh and the rate of accretion may be an important factor in determining the energy production and emission .",
    "perhaps , a central massive bh may not have yet formed in some galaxies even though a dusty disk is present ; alternatively , the bh is present but the accretion rate may not be high enough to ignite the activity : the absence of activity may be due to either a puny bh or an underfed massive one . for the two galaxies mentioned above , their velocity dispersions of order 240 km s@xmath7",
    "@xcite suggest a black hole mass of @xmath68 @xmath13 , quite typical of many early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , their inactivity may most likely be due to a radiation inefficient mode of , or lack of , fuel accretion rather than a lack of a bh .",
    "further support for a lack of fuel transport comes from close examination of the central regions of dusty galaxies . @xcite",
    "examined wfpc2 images of the cfa sample of seyfert 2 galaxies and found that the presence of nuclear spiral dust lanes within the inner 10 - 100 pc is nearly ubiquitous .",
    "apparently , such dust spirals appear necessary in order for the gas to lose angular momentum and infall effectively into the supermassive bh , thereby producing real agn activity . although we were unable to produce color images for most of our galaxies since they were observed in only one band ( f702w ) , examination of the optical depth images ( see  [ dustm ] ) revealed that nuclear dust spirals are not a common feature in our sample galaxies , appearing in only about four of 29 dusty galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with their lack of strong activity .",
    "we showed in  [ galcorr ] that a significantly higher fraction of the galaxies with dust have detections in the radio .",
    "a survey of radio - loud early - type galaxies @xcite has shown that the incidence of dust is 89% , about twice as high as found in our snapshot sample of relatively benign , radio - quiet early - type galaxies ( 43% ) .",
    "even in the @xmath1 sample , which is biased for the detection of dust , the dust detection rate ( 78% ) is significantly lower than that of the radio - loud sample .",
    "however , the overall rates of radio and emission line detection are slightly higher than those in the snapshot sample ( table [ drate ] ) . recently , @xcite show that the detection rate of dust and dusty disks in nearby fr - i radio sources is nearly 100% . in 4 out of 5 cases where the galaxies are sufficiently nearby to allow a detailed look of the nuclei , sparks et al . also report the presence of optical jets emanating perpendicular to face - on dust disks .",
    "these studies provide strong support for the idea that radio and nuclear activities are intimately linked with the presence of clumpy dust , and strongly suggest that the disks and filaments are the source of fuel and gas supply for the radio engines lying at the core of the galaxy .",
    "if all galaxies have central bhs ( as is very likely ) and the presence of dust is higher in galaxies that are active , this implies that galaxies have active duty cycles , and that the central supply of gas and dust is the requisite for the onset of the activity .",
    "the probable relationship between the mass / size of the dusty disks and the central velocity dispersion (  [ vdis ] ) , coupled with a similar correspondence between the latter and the central bh mass , suggests that the mass of the disk is connected with that of the bh . if real , it would imply that activity in early - type galaxies may undergo a process of evolution in which dust is acquired , settles , and provides a channel and fuel reservoir that support the growth and activity of the central massive bh .",
    "we note , however , that not all galaxies in which a central bh has been found show visibly detectable dusty disk , and not all galaxies with dusty disk are detected , due to projection effects @xcite .",
    "thus , the two effects might mitigate each other to some extent .",
    "confirming previous studies , we find that dust is very common in elliptical studies . although this result has been noted before , our unbiased and volume - limited sample puts such finding on a better footing .",
    "there is a strong correspondence between the presence of dust and the detection of radio and far infrared emission . among those galaxies with visibly detectable dust",
    ", a significant correlation is found between the derived mass of the dust and infrared luminosities , especially when only systems with filamentary dust are considered . at the limit of the @xmath1 survey , dusty galaxies are more than 10 times more likely to have 100 @xmath2 m detection than dustless galaxies , and those with filamentary dust are @xmath3 4 times more likely to have 100 @xmath2 m detection than those with dusty disks .",
    "this result suggests that the 100 @xmath2 m radiation most likely comes from filamentary dust which absorbs uv and visible radiation from the surrounding stars and reradiate it in the far - ir . while it is possible to have detection in 100 @xmath2 m _ without _ visually detectable dust ( e.g. , ngc 2549 , ngc 3348 ) , the presence of dust makes the detection much more likely .",
    "galaxies with detectable , clumpy dust are also much more likely to show nuclear activity in the form of radio and line emission than dustless galaxies .",
    "the formation of clumpy dust thus appears to be a necessary ingredient for radio and emission - line activity .",
    "however , galaxies with dust in small disky morphology are not any more likely to show such activity than those having irregular , filamentary dust .",
    "nearly all dusty disks are well aligned with the major axes of the galaxies in which they reside , while dust filaments seem to be more randomly oriented .",
    "if both types of dust have the same origin , then the dust is most likely acquired externally and requires time to settle dynamically",
    ". however , there appears to be no correlation between the presence of dust and the ambient galaxy density .",
    "alternatively , the two types of dust may have different origins . a spectroscopic survey to study the dynamics of a well - defined sample of galaxies",
    "is needed to confirm the external or internal origin of dust .",
    "the possible relationship between the size of the dusty disks with the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy suggests a causal connection between the bh mass and the mass / size of the dusty disk and bulge .",

    "<S> , dust is found in @xmath3 78% of the galaxies , 15 of which contain dusty disks . in those galaxies with detectable dust , </S>",
    "<S> the apparent mass of the dust correlates with radio and far infrared luminosity , becoming more significant for systems with filamentary dust . </S>",
    "<S> a majority of @xmath1 and radio detections are also associated with dusty galaxies rather than dustless galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that thermal emission from clumpy , filamentary dust is the main source of the far - ir radiation in early type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> dust in small disk - like morphology tends to be well aligned with the major axis of the host galaxies , while filamentary dust appears to be more randomly distributed with no preference for alignment with any major galactic structure . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , if the dusty disks and filaments have a common origin , the dust originates externally and requires time to dynamically relax and settle in the galaxy potential in the form of compact disks . </S>",
    "<S> more galaxies with visible dust than without dust display emission lines , indicative of ionized gas , although such nuclear activity does not show a preference for dusty disk over filamentary dust . </S>",
    "<S> there appears to be a weak relationship between the mass of the dusty disks and central velocity dispersion of the galaxy , suggesting a connection with a similar recently recognized relationship between the latter and the black hole mass . </S>"
