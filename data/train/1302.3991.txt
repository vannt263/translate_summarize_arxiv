    "here we discuss the particular case where the phases that appear in the scalar vevs are determined independently of the arbitrary parameters of the scalar potential .",
    "these are referred to as calculable phases , and the framework as geometrical cp violation ( gcpv ) .",
    "gcpv requires at least three higgs doublets and a non - abelian symmetry @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 ( a discrete subgroup of @xmath4 ) was the first group found to produce such calculable phases @xcite .",
    "in @xcite this was generalised to larger groups obtaining the same calculable phases and more recently , several new phase solutions were advanced and expressed in terms of the number of scalars and the group @xcite .",
    "we will briefly review the framework , explaining the origin and clarifying some of the possible generalisations in some detail .",
    "the notation follows mostly from @xcite , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( the assumption that the vevs have the same magnitude is justified by the respective potentials favouring this type of minima in very general cases ) .",
    "the only phase dependence in the renormalisable @xmath0 potential for a scalar triplet can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the cyclic permutations and the phases @xmath9 are @xmath10 and permuting , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . due to a combination of the cyclic properties of the group and invariance under the gauge group , @xmath13 must be verified @xcite . if we constrain ourselves to renormalisable potentials this invariant is the only phase dependence in the potential ( with its hermitian conjugate , @xmath14 ) , and the minimum of the scalar potential depends on @xmath15 if @xmath16 appears in the potential with negative coefficient , @xmath16 should be maximised corresponding to a contribution of @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath16 should be minimised by the phases - but a contribution of @xmath19 is not allowed , as @xmath20 would violate @xmath13 .",
    "the equilateral triangle shape associated with the minimising solution for @xmath16.,width=3 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] illustrates how the minima with @xmath21 corresponds to a contribution of @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath0 gcpv vevs like @xmath23 ( corresponding to @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) are obtained from such configurations .",
    "the same solutions can be obtained in larger groups containing @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is the semi - direct product of cyclic groups @xmath26 , and by considering analogous semi - direct products it is possible to find new gcpv candidates - although in general only by going to non - renormalisable potentials .",
    "a direct generalisation involves groups @xmath27 with @xmath28 factors of @xmath29 inside the brackets .",
    "the properties of the group lead to the lowest order phase dependent invariant being a direct generalisation of eq.([eq : leading3 ] ) @xmath30 the order of such invariants is @xmath31 and already for @xmath32 this is of order 6 and non - renormalisable . for even number of scalars",
    "@xmath33 the situation is arguably less interesting , as @xmath20 is an allowed solution to minimise the invariant ( for @xmath33 even it verifies @xmath13 as required ) .",
    "but with an odd number of scalars @xmath33 one has e.g. for @xmath34 @xmath35 in this particular case with @xmath36 . as was the case with @xmath37 , @xmath20",
    "is not allowed due to the requirement @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that to minimise the generalised @xmath38 the requirement is @xcite @xmath39 corresponding to adjacent sides of a regular @xmath33-sided polygon , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pentagon ] for @xmath34 .",
    "the pentagon shape associated with the minimising solution for @xmath40.,width=5 ]    this can be obtained e.g. with @xmath41 and the remaining phases vanishing .",
    "the vevs are then of the type @xmath42    if we consider instead the more general groups @xmath43 with @xmath28 factors of @xmath44 inside the brackets , there are some cases of interest : ( 1 ) @xmath45 ( an integer multiple ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath46 is not a multiple but shares a prime factor with @xmath33 ; ( 3 ) @xmath46 and @xmath33 share no prime factors .",
    "the first case is the most straightforward - depending on the irreducible representation ( irrep ) chosen one can obtain the same gcpv vevs that are available with @xmath47 , or alternatively the choice of irrep forbids the invariant in eq.([eq : leadingn ] ) , leaving as lowest order phase dependent invariant @xmath48 of order @xmath49 .",
    "the solutions to eq.([eq : oddnmin ] ) for odd @xmath33 are then changed from eq.([eq : oddnvev ] ) to @xcite @xmath50 for a discussion of the second case ( which always applies when @xmath46 and @xmath33 are both even ) we refer the interested reader to @xcite .",
    "the third case merits some detailed discussion here - due to invariance under the gauge group and as there is no shared prime factor , the relevant phase dependent invariant is @xmath51 which differs from the previously featured invariants in an important way : each individual term no longer has all the @xmath1 in it . for @xmath52",
    "this means that there can be independent invariants @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and so on . for odd @xmath33",
    "there are @xmath55 independent invariants when the @xmath14 is considered , for @xmath33 even there is one unpaired invariant that is its own @xmath14 so the total is @xmath56 .",
    "it is interesting that for @xmath57 this class of invariants appears at order 4 and they are therefore renormalisable . in the case @xmath37 and @xmath57 ( which corresponds to the group @xmath58 ) , if we want to minimise the phase - dependent invariant @xmath59 , then the phases @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , of vev @xmath63 , result in the @xmath64 solution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] , but note the respective @xmath2 from eq.([eq : u ] ) leaves @xmath65 invariant apart from a global phase .",
    "indeed this is the case for any @xmath46 and odd @xmath33 , the invariant @xmath66 is minimised by @xmath67 or by @xmath68 ( starting from @xmath69 ) .",
    "this can be obtained by solving the equations @xmath70 or equivalently by picturing the regular polygon with @xmath33 sides , and assigning consecutive @xmath71 either clockwise or anti - clockwise always leaving @xmath55 sides between consecutive @xmath71 ( and also between the last @xmath72 and @xmath69 ) . in any case , the @xmath2 relating such a solution to its conjugate only shifts each term of the invariant @xmath73 by the global phase @xmath74 ( the @xmath14 is shifted by @xmath75 ) .",
    "in addition , for odd @xmath52 , there are multiple invariants appearing at order @xmath76 with different phase dependences , say @xmath9 , @xmath77 etc .",
    "it is not possible to have @xmath78 simultaneously with @xmath79 ( and not with all @xmath80 either ) .",
    "this is the case already for @xmath34 , where one can take @xmath81 and @xmath82 , with the respective invariants being renormalisable only for @xmath57 .",
    "as noted above , @xmath83 minimises the @xmath9 invariant ( which corresponds to @xmath84 ) with all @xmath85 . but",
    "this type of phase solution simultaneously corresponds to all @xmath86 which does not extremise the @xmath77 invariant ( indeed each @xmath77 can be expressed as a sum of two @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath87 ) . for",
    "even @xmath33 there are some differences : while @xmath88 may not be compatible with @xmath89 , it is compatible with @xmath80 . for @xmath32 , @xmath90 , and from the self - conjugate invariant",
    "the dependence is @xmath91 ; then @xmath88 can be obtained from e.g. @xmath92 which also gives @xmath80 which is the desired minimising solution if the @xmath77 invariant has a negative coefficient . for @xmath93 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and from the self - conjugate invariant the dependence is @xmath94 ; then @xmath95 and @xmath80 are obtained for e.g. @xmath96 and this is a minimising solution as long as the coefficients of the @xmath9 , @xmath77 and @xmath97 invariants are respectively positive , negative and positive . once again , the @xmath2 associated to the solution only shifts the invariant by a global phase .",
    "when fermions are added to the framework of gcpv it is not trivial to construct viable models .",
    "leading order structures were suggested in @xcite .",
    "calculable phases are also robust when the potential includes non - renormalisable terms @xcite .",
    "based on these results , a minimal model of gcpv fitting all data was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the group employed is @xmath0 and a minimal amount of additional matter is added .",
    "the three higgs doublets , @xmath1 , transform as a @xmath0 triplet assigned to a @xmath98 irrep ( in this section we denote them with a lower index ) .",
    "their hermitian conjugates @xmath99 transform as the conjugate representation @xmath100 ( in this section we denote them with an upper index ) .",
    "the relevant generators of the group will be denoted as @xmath101 ( cyclic permutation ) and @xmath102 ( diagonal phases ) .",

    "@xmath107 corresponds to the @xmath108 used in section [ sec : gcpv ] .",

    "further details about @xmath0 can be found in the references of @xcite .    from the solution in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangle ] we can have a complex vev of the type : @xmath113 this vev necessarily violates cp , as the corresponding @xmath2 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) ) does not leave the potential invariant .",
    "the full scalar potential is presented later as we first focus on the yukawa interactions of the quarks .",
    "the possible yukawa contractions in this framework were considered briefly in @xcite and in more detail in @xcite : in order to make invariant yukawa terms some of the quarks must transform as triplet or anti - triplet under @xmath0 .",
    "we write the invariants symbolically as @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( without explicit @xmath116 indices ) .",
    "@xmath117 are the left - handed quark doublets and @xmath118 , @xmath119 are the up and down right - handed singlets . if @xmath120 is a @xmath98 we would necessarily require the @xmath121 to transform also as a @xmath98 , conversely if @xmath122 is a @xmath100 , @xmath123 is forced to be a @xmath100 .",
    "at least one sector has a leading order yukawa structure given by the @xmath0 invariant @xmath124 . with the symmetrical vev in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vev ] ) , this structure leads to a mass matrix with degenerate quark masses @xcite and",
    "so the conclusion is that @xmath117 can not be assigned as a triplet or an anti - triplet .",
    "we choose instead @xmath118 and @xmath119 as @xmath0 triplets so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are invariant with @xmath117 as singlets .",
    "both sectors then have yukawas from the @xmath0 invariants @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "although @xmath128 results in 9 distinct singlets , the group properties are such that any @xmath129 with @xmath130 explicitly involves powers of @xmath131 ( complex ) , so not all possibilities are allowed by cp invariance of the lagrangian . to have renormalisable yukawa interactions we assign @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 each as one of the three @xmath135 singlets .",
    "the possibilities are assigning all three @xmath117 in the same singlet irrep , or assigning two in the same , or all three @xmath117 in different irreps .",
    "all three structures lead to mass matrices that have a special structure defined by rows",
    ". when @xmath117 is a @xmath136 , @xmath137 or @xmath138 , the respective @xmath139 or @xmath140 product is @xmath136 , @xmath138 or @xmath137 respectively , which essentially amounts to a shift in the position of the @xmath131 in the mass matrix .",
    "more explicitly the corresponding down mass matrix looks like :    @xmath141    and the associated up quark mass matrix looks very similar with @xmath142 instead of @xmath131 and the second and third rows swapped . if instead @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134",
    "are assigned to @xmath136 , @xmath136 , and @xmath138 respectively , we get : @xmath143 we recall that due to the explicit cp invariance of the lagrangian the couplings are real and the phase appears only through the vev .",
    "consider then the hermitian matrices @xmath144 :    @xmath145    @xmath146    the vanishing off - diagonal entries are a consequence of @xmath147 .",
    "the determinant of @xmath148 is zero but it has two non - vanishing masses , and the choice with all generations of @xmath117 in the same singlet irrep ( not shown ) leads to a rank 1 structure with a single non - vanishing mass .",
    "it is apparent that these hermitian structures are real . to obtain a viable ckm matrix",
    "we need to generate additional off - diagonal terms and to somehow preserve the complex phase .",
    "off - diagonal terms appear in @xmath144 when rows have the @xmath131 in the same column , and the minimal way to get them is to add a gauge singlet scalar @xmath149 that is a non - trivial @xmath0 singlet . without loss of generality",
    "we place @xmath149 in the irrep @xmath137 , enabling a new non - renormalisable yukawa coefficient populating each row from @xmath150 . for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 in @xmath136 , @xmath136 , and @xmath138 respectively ,",
    "we add to @xmath151 the corresponding matrix : @xmath152 from the interference @xmath153 we obtain the required additional off - diagonal entries .",
    "the effect of @xmath154 can be absorbed within the existing structure of @xmath155 .",
    "we now want a complex phase in the ckm matrix , from complex @xmath144 .",
    "the minimal possibility is to consider non - renormalisable interactions with higher powers of @xmath156 e.g.  @xmath157 .",
    "it turns out that the non - trivial structure extracted from such interactions is @xmath158 where the identity @xmath147 was used and the existing coefficients were redefined to absorb similar entries in the mass matrix . from the interference @xmath159 we obtain phases in @xmath144 that enable complex ckm elements , @xmath160 and @xmath161 give structures that do not qualitatively change the analysis . @xmath162 and @xmath163 are the minimal mandatory additions needed for a perfect fit to the existing data .",
    "the lagrangian ( showing the @xmath0 indices ) is : @xmath164 we found that the only choice that favourably accounts for the precision flavour data is @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 as @xmath136 , @xmath136 and @xmath138 respectively . in the up quark sector , @xmath165 can be considered diagonal , and we need only one additional non - renormalisable yukawa in order to generate the small up quark mass ( recall the determinant of the renormalisable structure is zero for this choice of irreps ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wolfenstein ] we show that this choice can successfully reproduce the wolfenstein parameters , and one can also compare the model values ( in the right column ) with the experimental values : @xmath166    , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 around their central values .",
    "crosses denote our model values .",
    "[ fig : wolfenstein ] ]    we present now the full scalar potential .",

    "( [ eq : vev ] ) is not affected by @xmath171 , it is only when @xmath172 and @xmath173 are small that it holds .",
    "one can add a @xmath174 symmetry acting on @xmath149 to trivially enforce these couplings to vanish ( in this case eq.([eq : yphi ] ) arises from a @xmath175 insertion instead of @xmath149 , all conclusions remaining unchanged ) .",
    "following the minimisation of the potential and determination of the mass eigenvalues , we observed these features ( for illustration we display only the cp - even scalar components ) : @xmath176 the @xmath149 field is much heavier ( beyond @xmath177tev ) and decouples from the @xmath116 doublets .",
    "more specifically , the mass of @xmath149 is determined by @xmath178 , while those of @xmath179 are controlled by @xmath180 . @xmath181 the physical scalars @xmath182 and @xmath183 mix in a very specific way ( see @xcite and references therein ) : the scalar mass squared matrix having the structure @xmath184 leading to one physical scalar @xmath185 that is orthogonal to the other scalars and having no @xmath186-type gauge couplings ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings of @xmath185 to up- and down - type quarks are strongly suppressed except for the @xmath188 and @xmath189 couplings which are about @xmath190 .",

    "this is a decoupling limit which reproduces almost sm - like scalar structure .",
    "( ii ) a scenario with richer collider consequences is possible when the exotic scalar @xmath185 is light enough to be produced at the lhc e.g. through @xmath189 or decays of tops or heavy scalars . under the reasonable assumption that @xmath193tev or so we can obtain the analytic relations : @xmath194^\\frac{1}{2 } \\bigr ) .",

    ", there can be a spectacular decay channel through @xmath198 , if @xmath199gev , with the pseudo - scalar @xmath200 then decaying to charged leptons of different flavours ( e.g. @xmath201 ) and the @xmath202 boson decaying to leptons , as in fig .",
    "( [ fig : feynman ] ) .",
    "there is enough freedom in the lepton sector to boost coupling of @xmath203 , which may have a sizeable branching ratio in this channel , but a more specific prediction requires a detailed numerical study of the lepton yukawa sector .     that can be tested at the lhc .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] ]    although in both scenarios ( i ) and ( ii ) there are a few heavy scalars above the current lhc limit of 650 gev or so , their relative heaviness compared to the sm higgs is not a result of fine - tuning of parameters as for each heavy state there is a reasonably independent combination of @xmath195-type couplings which simply has to be set to a higher value ( we have verified this numerically ) .",
    "if the lhc bound goes up , we have to accordingly raise the maximum allowed value of some @xmath195 beyond @xmath204 e.g. up to maximum allowed value of @xmath205 to go over @xmath177tev .",
    "a final consequence worth pointing out is that the additional scalar states below @xmath177tev in both scenarios ( i ) and ( ii ) , all coupling to sm gauge bosons , would affect the energy dependence of longitudinal gauge boson scattering .",
    "this energy dependence might be different from the sm expectation due to the extra scalars , whose quantitative impact may be probed at the high luminosity option of the lhc depending on their masses and couplings .",
    "we have reviewed and clarified the framework of geometrical cp violation in the context of multi - higgs models .",
    "we then reviewed the realisation of spontaneous cp violation of geometrical origin in a minimal @xmath0 flavour model that reproduces the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "this scenario is quite falsifiable , as only two choices broadly worked , out of which only one set of representations fits the precision of flavour data .",
    "the scalar sector of this model retains some symmetry of the flavour group and this can lead to exotic scalar decays into multi - lepton of different flavours , which would be a smoking gun signal of the model that is testable at the lhc .",
