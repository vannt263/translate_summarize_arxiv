    "a new bosonic resonance with a mass of about 125  has recently been observed at the large hadron collider by both atlas collaboration @xcite and cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "the mass of the resonance is suggestive that this resonance is the higgs boson that should exist in the standard model of particle physics as a spin zero parity - even resonance .",
    "significant effort is now directed at determining the properties and couplings of this new resonance to confirm that it is indeed the higgs boson of the standard model . in this work",
    "we specify this new boson by the symbol @xmath2 and we call it the higgs , even though it has not been proved to be the higgs of the standard model .",
    "this resonance is observed primarily in three decay channels @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where one ( or both ) of the @xmath1 s and @xmath6 s are off - shell .",
    "it is well known that the spin and parity of the resonance and its couplings can be determined by studying the momentum and angular distributions of the decay products .",
    "indeed there is little doubt that a detailed numerical fit to the invariant masses of decay products and their angular distributions will reveal the true nature of this resonance .",
    "however , a detailed study of the angular distributions requires large statistics and may not be feasible currently .",
    "several studies existed in the literature before the discovery of this new resonance and yet several papers have appeared recently on strategies to determine the spin and parity of the resonance @xcite . yet",
    ", there is no clear conclusion on the step by step methodology to determine these properties with the minimum number of events and least possible angular measurements .",
    "the recent result  @xcite from cms collaboration on the determination of spin and parity of the new boson is not conclusive .    in this paper",
    "we are exclusively concerned with higgs decaying to four charged leptons , which proceeds via a pair of @xmath1 bosons : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 are leptons @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "since the higgs is not heavy enough to produce two real @xmath1 bosons , we can have one real and another off - shell @xmath1 , or both the @xmath1 s can be off - shell . while we deal with the former case in detail our analysis applies equally well to the later case .",
    "we find that only in a very special case dealing with @xmath12 boson it is more likely that both the @xmath1 bosons are off - shell .",
    "we emphasize that the final state @xmath13 is not equivalent to @xmath14 or @xmath15 as sometimes mentioned in the literature , since the latter final states have to be anti - symmetrized with respect to each of the two sets of identical fermions in the final state .",
    "the anti - symmetrization of the amplitudes is not done in our analysis and hence our analysis applies only to @xmath13 .",
    "we examine the angular distributions and present a strategy to determine the spin and parity of @xmath2 , as well as its couplings to the @xmath1-bosons with the least possible measurements .",
    "since the decay mode @xmath16 has been observed , @xmath2 is necessarily a boson and the landau - yang theorem  @xcite excludes that it has spin @xmath17 .",
    "further , assuming charge conjugation invariance , the observation of @xmath18 also implies  @xcite that @xmath2 is a charge conjugation @xmath19 state . in making this assignment of charge conjugation",
    "it is assumed that @xmath2 is an eigenstate of charge conjugation . with the charge conjugation of @xmath2",
    "thus established we will only deal with the parity of @xmath2 henceforth .",
    "we consider only spin-0 and spin-2 possibilities for the @xmath2 boson .",
    "higher spin possibilities need not be considered for a comparative study as the number of independent helicity amplitudes does not increase any more @xcite .",
    "the process under consideration requires that bose symmetry be obeyed with respect to exchange of the pair of @xmath1 bosons .",
    "this constraints the number of independent helicity amplitudes to be less than or equal to six . even if the spin-@xmath20 of @xmath2 is higher ( i.e. @xmath21 ) , the number of independent helicity amplitudes still remains six .",
    "however , the helicity amplitudes corresponding to higher spin states involve higher powers of momentum of @xmath1 , independent of the momentum dependence of the form factors describing the process .",
    "we will show that even for @xmath12 under a special case only two independent helicity amplitudes may survive just as in the case of @xmath22 .",
    "the two cases are in principle indistinguishable unless one makes an assumption on the momentum dependence of the form factors involved .",
    "we start by considering the most general decay vertex for both scalar and tensor resonances",
    "@xmath2 decaying to two @xmath1 bosons .",
    "we evaluate the partial decay rate of @xmath2 in terms of the invariant mass squared of the dilepton produced from the non - resonant @xmath1 and the angular distributions of the four lepton final state .",
    "we demonstrate that by studying three uni - angular distributions one can almost completely determine the spin and parity of @xmath2 and also explore any anomalous couplings in the most general fashion .",
    "we find that @xmath23 and @xmath24 can easily be excluded .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 possibilities can also be easily distinguished , but may require some lepton invariant mass measurements if the most general tensor vertex is considered .",
    "only if @xmath2 is found to be of spin-2 , a complete three angle fit to the distribution is required to distinguish between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the determination of couplings and spin , parity of the boson is important as there are other spin-0 and spin-2 particles predicted , such as the @xmath29 radion @xcite and @xmath30 kaluza - klein graviton  @xcite , which can easily mimic the initial signatures observed so far .",
    "such cases have already been considered in the literature even in the context of this resonance .",
    "our analysis is most general and such extensions are limiting cases in our analysis as the couplings are defined by the model .    in section  [ sec :",
    "analysis ] we layout the details of our analysis , with sections  [ subsec : scalar ] and [ subsec : tensor ] devoted exclusively to spin-0 higgs and spin-2 boson respectively .",
