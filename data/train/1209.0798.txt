    "it is a highly non - local quantity that can not be evaluated in the lda even as a first approximation , but we do not dwell on it here .",
    "in fact , the total free - energy given by chnc was used to calculate a deuterium hugoniot in  @xcite but the nature of the purely electronic part @xmath38 , where n is the total number of electrons , was not examined there in detail . here",
    "we high - light that aspect and concentrate on the electronic part of the exchange - correlation free energy @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system and its free energy calculation are similar to that of the electron gas , except that the unresponsive ` jellium ' background is replaced by the proton subsystem .",
    "thus @xmath40 here the superfix _ mf _ stands for ` mean - field ' , and all the terms have an obvious meaning . since the electron and proton densities are identical , the electron wigner - seitz radius @xmath41 is also the proton @xmath41 .",
    "the classical map is needed only for the electrons .",
    "we have used the hnc version of the classical map  @xcite , i.e. , chnc , for this calculation . in chnc the quantum electrons ( even at @xmath11=0 ) are treated as a coulomb gas at a finite temperature dependent on @xmath41 and @xmath11 .",

    "the exchange free energy @xmath45 is simply the exchange energy at @xmath46 , and is the same for the system with protons ( hydrogen ) or without protons ( i.e. , jellium ) .",
