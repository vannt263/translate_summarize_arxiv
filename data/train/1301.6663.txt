    "<S> quantum coherence and interference effects in atomic and molecular physics has been extensively studied due to intriguing counterintuitive physics and potential important applications . here </S>",
    "<S> we present one such application of using quantum coherence to generate and enhance gain in extreme ultra - violet(xuv)(@58.4 nm in helium ) and infra - red(@794.76 nm in rubidium ) regime of electromagnetic radiation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that using moderate external coherent drive , a substantial enhancement in the energy of the lasing pulse can be achieved under optimal conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the role of coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper is intended to be pedagogical on this subject of coherence - enhanced lasing . </S>"
