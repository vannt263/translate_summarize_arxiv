    "optical cooling of atoms has come a long way since it was first proposed ; magneto  optical traps are even found in undergraduate laboratories  @xcite .",
    "the field of ultracold molecules , in contrast , is still in its infancy .",
    "ultracold diatomic alkali molecules ( @xmath0  @xmath1k for rb@xmath2  @xcite ) are routinely produced from bose - einstein condensates through feshbach resonances .",
    "some groups ( see , for example ,  @xcite and  @xcite ) have demonstrated the possibility of cooling the internal degrees of such molecules , cooling ultracold di - alkali molecules to their lowest rovibronic levels by means of laser - stimulated state transfer processes .",
    "present methods of producing ultracold samples suffer from one of two major drawbacks : either they are specific to particular species , or they produce very low densities .",
    "the bulk of optical cooling methods are applicable only to a handful of species because they rely on a closed optical transition within which the population can cycle  @xcite .",
    "most atoms and molecules do not have such a transition available , but instead exhibit a large number of loss channels through which the population is gradually lost , halting the cooling .",
    "samples of cold molecules are therefore generally produced by capturing the low - velocity tail of the maxwell - boltzmann distribution of a hotter initial sample @xcite .",
    "however , such filtering methods do not lead to an increase of the phase - space density and thus only capture a small fraction of the initial population , leading to very dilute samples .",
    "one possibility to solve this problem is through the use of non - resonant processes @xcite or cavities @xcite .",
    "the latter require extremely high precision alignment of the cavity mirrors as well as complicated loading of the molecules into the optical cavity mode .",
    "the requirements for integrated systems near the surface of a substrate in the form of atom chips @xcite are even more stringent .    here",
    ", we investigate a mechanism for the cooling of a particle using only a single plane mirror in place of a cavity . in principle",
    ", this scheme only relies on the dipole force of a refractive particle in a laser beam and thus applies to a wide range of atomic and molecular species as well as , for example , dielectric micro- or nanospheres .",
    "however , in the present work we focus on the basic principles of the cooling scheme and thus restrict the analysis to the simplest case of a two - level atom .",
    "conceptually , one can view the interaction between the atom and the mirror as being closely related to that between a micromechanical oscillator , acting as a mobile mirror , and a second mirror .",
    "such schemes have been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite in various configurations . + although we have recently shown that one can treat these two situations as two opposite limits of the same model @xcite , the situation we explore here behaves differently , and this can be attributed to two facts .",
    "firstly , the coupling strength between the static and moving scatterer ( atom or mirror ) is very different in the two cases : an atom merely perturbs the field it interacts with , whereas a mirror acts as a moving boundary condition and changes the field significantly .",
    "secondly , the effect we investigate here is only dominant at large atom  mirror separations .",
    "thus , our proposed cooling scheme operates in a parameter regime that is as yet mostly unexplored .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the key features of our system and propose a simple classical explanation of the cooling scheme . in section  [ sec : system ] the relevant quantum equations of motion are introduced .",
    "section  [ sec : perturbative ] solves these equations of motion analytically through the use of perturbative methods , whereas section  [ sec : numerical ] gives the results of numerical simulations used to explore the implications of the theory in further detail .",
    "section  [ sec : beyond ] compares our results with those of traditional doppler cooling , and finally section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes and concludes our discussion .",
    "parallel to a mirror , a distance @xmath3 away , interacts with a pump beam and its time - delayed reflection .",
    "( b ) in the frame of the atom , the ( relativistically transformed ) pump beam and its reflection are tilted by an angle @xmath4 and produce a net retarding force , @xmath5 . ]",
    "we start with a classical explanation of the situation , which provides the motivation for the mathematical model presented in the next section .",
    "the phenomenon of optical binding has been known for some time ( see , for example , @xcite ) and is now a common occurrence . at a basic level",
    ", optical binding takes place between two dielectric spheres when one sphere focuses the light onto a second sphere , which is subsequently trapped .",
    "if we now consider just one such sphere in front of a mirror , the modified electric field will be reflected back towards the sphere itself .",
    "in essence , then , the sphere will be attracted to its own image . however",
    ", this interaction is delayed by the time @xmath6 it takes the disturbance in the electric field to travel from the sphere to the mirror and back , where @xmath7 is the time that light from the atom takes to reach the mirror .",
    "suppose , now , that the sphere is moving parallel to the plane of the mirror with velocity @xmath8 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation](a ) . in this case , the sphere moves a distance @xmath9 during the light roundtrip time .",
    "thus , the disturbed light field lags behind the particle and creates an attractive force in the direction opposite to the motion of the particle .",
    "this attractive force can be shown to be a viscous force , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "this scenario also applies to the case of a single atom interacting with an off - resonant beam , where the atom can effectively be modeled as a refractive particle .",
    "note that the interaction between a single atom and its image in a distant mirror has already been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we may consider the same situation in the reference frame of the moving particle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motivation](b ) . in this case both the incident laser beam and its reflection are tilted by an angle @xmath4 with respect to normal incidence on the mirror .",
    "the sum potential is therefore offset from the particle position by an amount proportional to its velocity , leading again to a velocity - dependent force opposing the motion .",
    "similar arguments apply for a particle moving along the direction of the pump beam , _",
    "i.e. _ , orthogonal to the mirror . in this case , the phase of the reflected beam is determined by the interaction of the particle with the pump at the earlier time @xmath6 . in effect , the atom exerts a delayed phase change on the light field , dragging the potential along with itself while moving and thus creating a non - conservative force .",
    "this effect is similar to the `` position dependent phase locking '' described in @xcite .",
    "and lies in a standing wave maintained by the pump beam . ]    in order to analyze the principles of the proposed cooling scheme most clearly , we simplify the situation described above to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) scheme and assume a single two - level atom as the particle to be cooled .",
    "a schematic of the system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the atom has a transition frequency @xmath10 and a decay rate @xmath11 and is described by the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 associated with the atomic momentum and position , respectively , and by the atomic dipole raising @xmath14 and lowering @xmath15 operators .",

    ", we neglect the frequency - dependence of the atom - field coupling and assume a single coupling coefficient @xmath21 .",
    "finally , mode @xmath22 is pumped by a laser , which enters our analysis as an initial condition , and far off resonant pumping is assumed , @xmath23 , where the atom mainly acts as a refractive particle and spontaneous scattering is reduced . for the numerical examples given in this paper , we consider @xmath24rb atoms and a realistic pump beam that is detuned from the @xmath25 transition of @xmath24rb by several linewidths .",

    "we can adiabatically eliminate the internal atomic dynamics and formally express the dipole operator as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a noise term @xcite .    in the following , we present two different ways of proceeding from this point . in the first instance we approximate further and use perturbation theory to derive the force experienced by the atom analytically , in section  [ sec : perturbative ] , and in the second instance we derive semiclassical equations of motion .",
    "the latter approach is then applied to numerical simulations of the situation in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",

    "we finally performed a large number of simulations to investigate the dependence of the steady - state temperature on the trap frequency .",

    "the trend in the data is reproduced well by the analytic expression . however , the simulated steady - state temperature is consistently a little higher than predicted .",

    "( ii ) higher order terms in the velocity @xmath8 are also expected to reduce friction compared to the lowest order analytical result . in both cases , therefore , the analytic expression is expected to overestimate the friction force and thus to predict too low temperatures .",

    "@xmath169 ; other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] . ]    all the theoretical analysis and simulations discussed so far have been based on adiabatic elimination of the internal atomic degrees of freedom , and therefore neglected doppler cooling . in  fig .",
    "[ fig : doppler_vs_mirror ] , we explore the variation of @xmath132 and the doppler temperature , @xmath167 , as a function of detuning from resonance when the particle is at the point of greatest friction ( @xmath117 ) , where @xmath170 is given by @xmath171 for negative values of @xmath37 . in the presence of both cooling effects , the stationary temperature achieved by the system",
    "is given by @xmath172 thus , for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : sst ] , the calculated steady - state temperature @xmath168 reduces to @xmath173  @xmath1k in the limit of vanishing @xmath155 .    from  fig .",
    "[ fig : doppler_vs_mirror ] one can see that the mirror - mediated force , for our tightly focused pump , is stronger than the doppler force for detunings larger than around @xmath174 in magnitude . in practice",
    "this has two implications : for large negative detunings , we expect the steady - state temperature of the system to be significantly lower than that predicted by doppler cooling ; whereas for large _ positive _ detunings , we still predict equilibrium temperatures of the order of mk .",
    "both our perturbative expressions and our simulations are calculated to lowest orders in the atomic saturation .",
    "however , it is well known that in the limit of very large detunings also higher order terms in the saturation parameter @xmath125 become significant . using the full expression for the diffusion constant @xcite , we can estimate the detuning for which we expect minimum diffusion and temperature .",
    "for the value of the saturation parameter @xmath175 used throughout this paper , it can be shown that @xmath132 attains a minimum at detunings of up to several tens of linewidths .",
    "our chosen parameters are therefore within the range of validity of the model .",
    "we have presented a mechanism for cooling particles by optical means which is based fundamentally on the dipole interaction of a particle with a light beam and therefore does not rely on spontaneous emission .",
    "the particle is assumed to be trapped and is simultaneously driven by an off - resonant laser beam .",
    "after the interaction with the particle the beam is reflected back onto the particle by a distant mirror . the time - delay incurred during the light round - trip to the mirror and back",
    "is exploited to create a non - conservative cooling force .",
    "the system was analyzed using stochastic simulations of the semiclassical equations of motion representing a single two - level atom coupled to a continuum of electromagnetic modes .",
    "the results of these computations were found to agree with the expectations of a perturbative analysis .",
    "our models predict sub - mk steady - state temperatures for @xmath24rb atoms interacting with a tightly focused laser beam several meters from the mirror , in an arrangement similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite . while most of the theory is presented for",
    "a one - dimensional model , results for the friction force in the transverse direction suggest that three - dimensional cooling is possible with this scheme .",
    "the model presented here requires a large separation between the atom and the mirror , of the order of several meters , for an observable cooling effect .",
    "this limitation can be overcome in several ways .",
    "first , the light could propagate in an optical fiber between the atom and the mirror to avoid the effects of diffraction .",
    "second , the required delayed reflection could be achieved through the use of a cavity instead of a mirror ; in contrast to cavity - mediated cooling schemes @xcite , the atom would remain external to the cavity . for a time delay @xmath7 of order @xmath109  ns one would require a cavity quality factor @xmath176 @xcite of the order of @xmath177 , which is achievable with present - day technology @xcite .",
