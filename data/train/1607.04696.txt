    "bottomonium is considered to be an excellent laboratory to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies  @xcite . due to a relatively large mass of the heavy bottom quark ,",
    "the bottomonium system is essentially nonrelativistic , which makes it relatively easy for people to study the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd via the bottomonium spectroscopy with a nonrelativistic approximation . in the past few years",
    ", great progress has been achieved in the study of the bottomonium spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "a fairly abundant bottomonium states have been established in experiments  @xcite(see tab .",
    "[ tabs ] ) .",
    "furthermore , many new experiments are being and/or to be carried out at lhc and belle . in near future , more missing bottomonium states will be discovered and more decay channels will be measured in experiments .",
    "thus , it is necessary to systematically carry out a study of the bottomonium states according to the recent progress .",
    "on the one hand we can obtain more knowledge of bottomonium states from experiments . on the other hand , the predicted properties can provide some useful references for our search for the missing bottomonium states in experiments .    in recent years , stimulated by the exciting progress in experiments ,",
    "many theoretical studies of bottomonium spectrum have been carried out with different methods , such as the widely used potential models  @xcite , lattice qcd  @xcite , effective lagrangian approach  @xcite , nonrelativistic effective field theories of qcd  @xcite , various coupled - channel quark models  @xcite , and light front quark model  @xcite . although some comparable predictions from different models , strong model dependencies still exist in the predictions .",
    "for example , the recent calculations with the relativized quark model  @xcite give a successful prediction of masses for the low - lying excitations , however , its predicted mass for the higher excitation @xmath5 is about 80 mev higher than the data . while the recent nonrelativistic constituent quark model  @xcite gives a good description of the mass for @xmath5 , however , its predictions of the masses for the ground states @xmath6 and @xmath7 are about 50 mev larger than the experimental values .",
    "furthermore , about the m1 transitions of @xmath8 , the predictions from the relativistic quark model  @xcite and nonrelativistic effective field theories of qcd  @xcite are about an order of magnitude smaller than the recent predictions from the relativized quark model  @xcite and nonrelativistic constituent quark model  @xcite .",
    "thus , to deepen our knowledge about the bottomonium spectrum , more theoretical studies are needed .    in this work",
    ", firstly we use the non - relativistic screened potential model  @xcite to calculate the masses and wavefunctions . in this model , the often used linear potential @xmath9 is replaced with the screened potential @xmath10 .",
    "the reason is that the linear potential , which is expected to be dominant at large distances , is screened or softened by the vacuum polarization effect of the dynamical light quark pairs  @xcite .",
    "such a screening effect might be important for us to reasonably describe the higher radial and orbital excitations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin - dependent interactions were considered perturbatively when they calculated the bottomonium spectrum .",
    "considering the corrections of the spin - dependent interactions to the space wavefunctions can not be included with the perturbative treatment , we treat the spin - dependent interactions as non - perturbations in our calculations . with the nonperturbative treatment",
    ", we can reasonably include the effect of spin - dependent interactions on the wavefuctions , which is important for us to gain reliable predictions of the decays .",
    "moreover , using the wavefunctions , we study the electromagnetic ( em ) transitions between bottomonium states . difference of our method from the often used potential models is that the em transition operator between initial and final hadron states is used a special nonrelativistic form @xmath11e^{-i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}_{j}}$ ]  @xcite , which has been well developed and widely applied to meson photoproduction reactions  @xcite . in this operator , the effects of binding potential between quarks",
    "is considered .",
    "furthermore , the possible higher em multipole contributions to a em transition process can be included naturally .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ spectrum ] , we calculate the masses and wavefunctions within a screened potential model . in sec .  [ emt ] , the em transitions between states are calculated , and our analysis and discussion are given .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sum ] .",
    ".bottomonium spectrum calculated by us . for comparison , the measured masses ( mev ) from the pdg  @xcite , and the theoretical predictions with the previous screened potential model  @xcite , relativized quark model  @xcite , and nonrelativistic constituent quark model  @xcite are also listed in the same table .
