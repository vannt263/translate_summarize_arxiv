    "the cdf collaboration has reported the observation of an excess of events @xcite in the @xmath7 channel with a statistical significance of 3.2@xmath8 corresponding to 4.3 fb@xmath9 of integrated luminosity .",
    "recently , cdf has included an additional 3 fb@xmath9 to their data sample @xcite , for a total of 7.3 fb@xmath9 , and the significance of this anomaly has grown to @xmath104.8@xmath8 ( @xmath11 including systematics ) .",
    "this is now a serious situation .",
    "an examination of the @xmath12 distribution for these events reveals a peak that is compatible with standard model ( sm ) @xmath13 production , as well as a second peak that is compatible with a new resonance at @xmath14 gev .",
    "this state of affairs has gathered much attention , even before the inclusion of the additional data sample .",
    "skeptics have been concerned about the detailed shape of the monte carlo simulation modeling of the sm background , the jet - energy scale , as well as possible contamination from top - quark production @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the cdf collaboration has shown @xcite that neither the top background nor changes to the jet - energy scale is likely to account for this excess .",
    "optimists have offered several new physics explanations , including a new @xmath0 boson @xcite @xcite , technicolor @xcite , supersymmetry with and without r - parity conservation @xcite , color octet production @xcite , and more @xcite .",
    "more recently , the d0 collaboration has weighed in on this anomaly@xcite and does not observe a signal at the same level as claimed by cdf in a luminosity sample of 4.3 fb@xmath9 .",
    "an understanding of this discrepancy between cdf and d0 has not yet been reached , and the situation most likely will only be clarified with results from the lhc . certainly , if new physics is really present , it s cross section is most likely to be at the low end of the range discussed by cdf .    here",
    ", we will assume the excess excess observed by cdf is due to new physics , and we will further examine the possibility of @xmath0 production , @xmath15 , as the potential source .",
    "interestingly , we note that the cdf data shows a sharp dip , or valley , in the @xmath12 spectrum between the first peak ( , sm @xmath13 production ) and the second peak ( the hypothetical @xmath0 boson ) ; this is the behavior that one might expect due to the destructive interference between the sm @xmath16 and @xmath17 and a new gauge boson @xcite .",
    "clearly , this new @xmath0 boson must have very leptophobic couplings in order to evade direct production at lepii as well as the tevatron and lhc @xmath0 drell - yan dilepton searches .",
    "in addition , there must be some mechanism which prohibits any significant @xmath18 mixing ( @xmath19 ) in order to be consistent with precision electroweak data and to avoid any ` leakage ' of the sm @xmath17 leptonic couplings to the @xmath0 .",
    "cdf reports @xcite that there is no particular excess of b - quarks in the events near @xmath20 gev , and thus we will assume that the @xmath0 decays democratically to all kinematically accessible hadronic states , , the @xmath0 has generation - independent couplings , is consistent with the existing cdf data@xcite . ] .",
    "it has been known since long ago ( in preparation for the ssc ) @xcite , that the associated production @xmath21 provides an excellent opportunity to perform diagnostic tests on the coupling structure of a new gauge boson . in particular ,",
    "if the @xmath0 explanation for the cdf excess is correct , then one should at some point also observe @xmath22 and @xmath23 associated production .",
    "as we will show below , given the cdf result , one can make relatively definitive predictions for the rates of these processes at both the tevatron and the lhc .    in what follows",
    ", we will perform an analysis of the possible coupling structure and strength for the @xmath0 that is consistent with the data and will determine the allowed regions for the left- and right - handed @xmath0 couplings",
    ". we will then be armed to compute the predictions for @xmath24 production .",
    "we find that the rates for @xmath25 are likely too small to be observed at the tevatron with current data samples , and that a @xmath0 in @xmath24 could be detected at the lhc with integrated luminosities of order a few fb@xmath9 once sm backgrounds are under control .",
    "we provide the most general expressions for these cross sections .",
    "we also examine the @xmath4 , as well as other , kinematic distributions and show that they can yield additional valuable coupling information , particularly for the left - handed quarks .",
    "our main conclusion is that the allowed regions of the @xmath0 couplings are relatively restricted , allowing for reasonably firm predictions for the associated production rates and the rates for other kinematic distributions .",
    "if the cdf anomaly is due to a new @xmath26 gev leptophobic @xmath0 boson , the lhc should confirm this signal relatively soon .",
    "we define the couplings of the @xmath0 to the sm quarks in a manner similar to that for the conventional sm @xmath17 boson , @xmath27 in order to make contact with our earlier analyses @xcite",
    ". it will also be convenient to define the chiral coupling combinations @xmath28 ( and similarly for @xmath29 ) for the analysis below . for simplicity , and to avoid possible issues with flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc )",
    ", we will assume that these couplings are generation - independent ; this assumption has very little ( if any ) direct impact in what follows as it is essentially only the @xmath0 couplings to the first generation quarks that determine its production cross sections at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "we will , however , return to this point later below when discussing the @xmath0 total decay width .",
    "since the observed excess is in the proposed @xmath30 channel , let us first examine the differential cross section for this process ; it is easily obtained from the expressions in the original refs .",

    "it is important to note that for large values of @xmath42 , @xmath38 behaves as @xmath43 and can provide a very significant cross section enhancement when @xmath44 as was noted numerically by some previous authors @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the other terms in the cross section are of order unity ( or parametrically smaller ) in the same limit .",
    "as we will see below , the presence of this term will allow for a large @xmath3 production rate , without necessarily enhancing the corresponding @xmath2 cross sections .",
    "however , we note that the possibility of @xmath44 implies that the group generator , @xmath45 , to which the @xmath0 couples does not commute with the usual @xmath46 isospin generators , , @xmath47\\neq 0 $ ]",
    ". this can have a number of implications elsewhere @xcite .    requiring that the @xmath0 decays only to two jets ,",
    "integration of the above expression over @xmath48 and the relevant parton densities leads to the numerical value for the ( pre - cut ) @xmath3 cross sections at the tevatron and lhc for arbitrary couplings given by @xmath49 these results explicitly show the enhancement arising in the case of @xmath44 . in performing these numerical calculations , and the ones found below , we make use of the cteq6.6 m parton density functions @xcite . since the apparent excess in the tevatron @xmath3 cross section is observed @xcite , prior to acceptance and analysis cuts , to be in the range of @xmath50  pb , this results in an ellipse of potentially allowed values in the @xmath51 plane .",

    ", a leptophobic @xmath0 boson will also be produced directly and contribute to dijet production and may be observed as a resonance in the dijet invariant mass spectrum .",
    "due to kinematics , the data from @xmath53 has the best signal to background ratio for searches in the dijet channel in this low mass region .",
    "ua2 @xcite performed such a search in the dijet channel and constrained the cross section to be less than roughly @xmath54 pb for a @xmath26 gev resonance .",
    "this places an additional constraint on the @xmath0 couplings that needs to be satisfied . employing the narrow width approximation ( which we will justify below ) ,",
    "the dijet rate induced by a @xmath0 at ua2 ( recall the cm energy for the @xmath53 was 630 gev ) resulting from the process @xmath55 can be written numerically as @xmath56 ~~(\\rm { pb})\\,,\\ ] ] making use of the same procedure and assumptions as above .",
    "given this result and the ua2 bound on the cross section , the _ largest _ corresponding constraint ellipse that can be drawn in the @xmath51 plane denoting the ua2 allowed region is obviously obtained when the @xmath0 has only left - handed quark couplings , , @xmath57 .",

    "again , we see that this distribution is quite sensitive to the @xmath93 couplings and peaks at significantly larger values when @xmath120 .    )",
    "distribution for the @xmath0 at the lhc in the cm frame for the same set of coupling choices as in the previous figure.,width=302 ]",
    "lastly , we have also examined the possibility of observing @xmath0 bremsstrahlung in @xmath136 production in @xmath137 annihilation , , @xmath138 .",
    "we found that the rate for this process is hopelessly small at lepii energies and thus does not provide a constraint on this scenario .",
    "in summary , we have examined the hypothesis that a leptophobic @xmath0 boson accounts for the excess of events in the @xmath1 channel as observed by cdf . the quoted range for the production cross section places constraints on the left - handed couplings of the @xmath0 to the up- and down - quarks .",
    "consistency with the lack of observation by d0 forces us to the lower end of this cross section range .",
    "further consistency with the non - observation of dijet resonances at @xmath20 gev at ua2 constrains these couplings , and severely limits the possible values of the @xmath0 right - handed couplings to the light quarks . assuming that these couplings are generation independent , these results provide a relatively restrictive allowed region for the four hadronic couplings of the @xmath0 .",
    "these allowed coupling regions translate into well - determined rates for the associated production of @xmath2 at the tevatron and lhc , as well as for @xmath3 at the lhc , apart from nlo corrections .",
    "the @xmath1 rate at the lhc is large and this channel should be observed soon once the sm backgrounds are under control .",
    "the rates for @xmath2 associated production are smaller , and these processes should not yet have been observed at the tevatron given the expected sm backgrounds .",
    "once detected , these processes will provide valuable information on the @xmath0 boson couplings .",
    "further information on the @xmath51 coupling relationship was shown to also be obtainable from measurements of the @xmath121 as well as other kinematic distributions at both the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "even with four free coupling parameters , this scenario is predictive , even more so once the @xmath3 cross section is better determined at the tevatron , and can be further tested at both the tevatron itself as well as at the lhc in the near future . in particular , the lhc should confirm ( or not ) this scenario soon .    *",
