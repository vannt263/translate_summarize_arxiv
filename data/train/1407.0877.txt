    "in 2009 , baados , silk and west@xcite ( hereafter bsw ) proposed an interesting mechanism that is when two massive dark matter particles falling from rest into the infinite red - shift surface of a extreme spinning bh described by the kerr metric can collides with an infinite high center - of - mass(cm ) energy .",
    "what we will now call the bsw effect .",
    "hence bhs may act as a natural planck scale particle accelerators .",
    "whereas in the case of non spinning bh described by the schwarzschild metric , the cm energy for colliding particles are finite@xcite . in a subsequent paper @xcite , the authors attempted to compute the flux reaching a distant observer from the annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles in the vicinity of an intermediate mass bh .",
    "soon after the appearance of this mechanism in the literature , several authors were criticized this effect from the different perspectives . particularly in@xcite and @xcite",

    "the surface gravity of the dilation bh for both the horizons ( @xmath35 ) are @xmath36    the bh temperature or hawking temperature of @xmath35 are @xmath37    then the area of both the horizons ( @xmath35 ) are @xmath38 interestingly , the area of both the horizons go to zero at the extremal limit ( @xmath29 ) . this feature is quite different from the well known rn and schwarzschild bh .",
    "the other characteristics of this space - time is that there is a curvature singularity at @xmath39 .",
    "finally , the entropy of both the horizons ( @xmath35 ) of the bh reads as @xmath40      this section is devoted to study the properties of the circular geodesics for charged dilation bh in the @xmath41 plane and also compute the isco equation for this bh .    to compute the geodesic motion of a test particle in the equatorial plane we set @xmath42 and @xmath43 and",
    "follow the pioneer book of s. chandrasekhar@xcite .",
    "thus we may write the lagrangian density in terms of the metric is given by @xmath44 the generalized momenta reads @xmath45 here superior dots denote differentiation with respect to affine parameter which is the proper time ( @xmath46 ) for time - like case and for null it is affine parameter(@xmath47 ) .",
    "since the lagrangian density does not depend explicitly on the variables ` @xmath48 ' and ` @xmath49 ' , so @xmath50 and @xmath51 are conserved quantities .",

    "i.e. @xmath103 thus one may obtain the isco equation for the charge dilation space - time from the following functional equation : @xmath104 @xmath105 for extremal case @xmath106 , it can be easily obtained the isco equation for charged dilation bh which is given by @xmath107 or @xmath108\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath109 , we obtain the radius of isco for rn bh , which is @xmath110 and in the limit @xmath111 , we recover the radius of isco for gmghs bh which is @xmath112 .",
    "this section is devoted to study the particle acceleration and collision in the cm frame . to compute the cm energy , we consider two particles coming from infinity with @xmath113 approaching the charged dilation bh with different angular momenta @xmath114 and @xmath115 and colliding at some radius @xmath116 .",
    "later , we consider the collision point @xmath116 to approach the horizon @xmath117 . also we have assumed the the particles to be at rest at infinity .",
    "the cm energy is evaluated by using the following formula which was first given by bsw @xcite reads @xmath118    we shall also assume throughout this work the geodesic motion of the colliding particles confined in the @xmath41 plane . since the charged dilation space - time has a time - like isometry followed by the time - like killing vector field @xmath119 whose projection along the four velocity @xmath120 of geodesics @xmath121 , is conserved along such geodesics ( where @xmath122 ) .",
    "similarly there is also the ` angular momentum ' @xmath123 is conserved due to the rotational symmetry ( where @xmath124 .    for massive particles ,",
    "the components of the four velocity are @xmath125 and    @xmath126    substituting this in ( [ cm ] ) , we get the center of mass energy : @xmath127 where , @xmath128    for simplicity , @xmath129 and substituting the value of @xmath16 , we obtain the cm energy near the event horizon ( @xmath20 ) of the charged dilation space - time : @xmath130 where @xmath20 is described in equation ( [ hocde ] ) . putting the value of @xmath131 in the above equation",
    "we get @xmath132 which shows that the cm energy is finite and depends upon the values of the angular momentum parameter .    whenever we taking the extremal limit @xmath29 , we get the cm energy near the event horizon @xmath117 : @xmath133 which suggests that the cm energy of collision for extremal charged dilation bh is diverging as we approaches the extremal limit .",
    "thus we get the unlimited cm energies .",
    "interestingly , it is independent of the fine tuning of the angular momentum parameter .",
    "this is one of the key point of the paper .",
    "* case i : * when @xmath32 , we recover the value of cm energy of rn bh , which is given by @xmath134    * case ii : * when @xmath34 , we retrieve the value of cm energy of gmghs bh which is given by @xmath135    in the limit @xmath136 , the above expression reduces to @xmath137 which is the cm energy of the schwarzschild bh . in fact",
    "this is indeed a finite quantity first observed in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , near the cauchy horizon @xmath138 the cm energy for charged dilation space - time is found to be @xmath139 where @xmath21 is described in equation ( [ hocdc ] ) .    since the values of @xmath140 is zero , i.e. @xmath141 , thus the value of cm energy near the inner horizon leads to diverging value .",
    "hence , @xmath142 this is another interesting feature of the charged dilation bh .",
    "the aim of this section is to compute the cm energy for rn bh at @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath117 .",
    "then we compare the results obtained for the different collision point .",
    "the metric for rn space - time can be written as    @xmath145    where the function @xmath146 is defined by @xmath147 the bh has event horizon which is situated at @xmath148 and cauchy horizon which is situated at @xmath149 .",
    "the equatorial time - like geodesics of rn bhs are ( see figs . 1 - 2 )",
    "@xmath150    next , we compute the cm energy for the rn space - time by using the well known formula as given by baados et al . in @xcite :    @xmath151    where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the 4-velocity of the two particles , which can be found from the following equation([utur1 ] ) .    @xmath154    therefore using([cm3 ] ) one can obtain the center - of - mass energy for this collision : @xmath155    as we have assumed @xmath129 previously , and substituting the value of @xmath146 one could obtain finally the cm energy near the event horizon(@xmath20 ) for non - extremal rn space - time(see figs . 3 - 4 ) @xmath156",
    "again we have already known from @xcite , the maximum cm energy strictly depend upon the values of critical angular momentum such that the particles can reach the event horizon with maximum tangential velocity .",
    "thus the critical angular momentum and the critical radius could be calculated from the radial effective potential .",
    "now we impose the following criterion for determining the critical values of angular momentum i.e. : @xmath157 now setting @xmath158 for marginal case , the equation turns out to be @xmath159 for non - extremal rn bh , the critical values of angular momentum can be determined by finding the real root of the above equation and using the following condition : @xmath160 it can be easily seen that in the limit @xmath161 , we retrieve the critical values of angular momentum for schwarzschild bh : @xmath162 since , we are interested in this work for extremal rn bh , thus it can be easily calculated the critical values of angular momentum parameter in the extremal limit @xmath163 .",
    "therefore the range of @xmath57 for in - falling geodesics is @xmath164    for extremal rn space - time , the values of cm energy near the horizon is given by @xmath165    since here we have assumed that the collision point is at @xmath166 and two particles have the angular momentum which is given by the following equation : @xmath167 in the extremal limit it goes to @xmath168 it was already mentioned in @xcite , a new phenomenon would appear if one of the particles participating in the collision has the critical angular momentum . if one of the particles have the diverging angular momentum at the horizon i.e.    @xmath169    then the corresponding value of the cm energy ( using eq . [ cm8 ] ) for extremal rn bh at the extremal horizon is @xmath170 thus for the extremal rn",
    "bh , we get the infinite amounts of cm energy",
    ".    now we will see what happens the cm energy if we choose the collision point to be isco .",
    "it is well known that for extremal rn bh the isco is at @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "now if we consider the collision point to be isco then the corresponding value of cm energy at the isco for extremal rn space - time is given by @xmath172    for the critical values of angular momentum @xmath173 and @xmath174 , the cm energy is found to be    @xmath175    similarly , one may compute the mbco for rn bh by setting @xmath176 which turns out to be @xmath177 .",
    "thus when the collision point to be mbco , the cm energy is found to be at @xmath144 :    @xmath178    for the critical values of angular momentum @xmath173 and @xmath174 , the cm energy is at @xmath179 found to be @xmath180    now we can compare the results obtained as @xmath181 thus we get , @xmath182 it is clearly evident that cm energy is diverging at the event horizon and finite at the mbco and at isco .    in the limit @xmath183 , we obtain the following equality : @xmath184",
    "here , we shall extend our analysis for schwarzschild bh and calculate the cm energy of the colliding particles at various collision points .",
    "first we choose the collision point to be horizon , then we choose the collision point to be isco and finally we have chosen the collision point is at mbco . to proceeds , we first write the metric of the schwarzschild bh in schwarzschild coordinates are @xmath185 the bh has an event horizon is located at @xmath186 . for this bh ,",
    "the equatorial time - like geodesics are described by @xmath187 and the components of four velocity are(see fig .",
    "5a )    @xmath188    since the schwarzschild space - time is the special case of rn space - time , therefore one can compute the cm energy(see figs .",
    "5b-7 ) using the equation ( [ cm4 ] ) as @xmath189    setting @xmath129 as is , one may obtain the cm energy near the event horizon for schwarzschild bh ( first calculated in @xcite ) is given by @xmath190 when @xmath191 and @xmath192 , the maximum cm energy for schwarzschild bh is found to be @xmath193 .",
    "again , we know the isco for schwarzschild bh is @xmath194 , thus the cm energy at isco is calculated to be @xmath195 for the critical values of angular momentum @xmath191 and @xmath192 , the cm energy is given by @xmath196    it is well known that the mbco for schwarzschild bh is occur at @xmath197 , thus the cm energy is found to be : @xmath198 if we take @xmath183 , the cm energy is found to be @xmath199 . whenever we take @xmath191 and @xmath192 , we have the cm energy @xmath200 now we may compare the results obtained as @xmath201 thus we have found , @xmath202 it is clearly evident that cm energy is maximum at the event horizon than the mbco and isco .",
    "in an earlier paper @xcite , we showed that a string bhs may act as a particle accelerators to arbitrarily high center - of - mass energy .",
    "also , we proved that for extremal gmghs space - time the center of mass energy of collision at @xmath203 is arbitrarily large . here , we would like to discuss the same more elaborately and graphically which was not given in the previous work .    to proceed it ,",
    "first we consider the time - like geodesics(see figs.8 - 9 ) on the equatorial plane @xcite reads @xmath204 where @xmath205 and @xmath206 . and",
    "@xmath207    therefore using([cm ] ) , we obtain the cm energy(see figs .",
    "10 - 11 ) for this collision : @xmath208 as we have assumed @xmath129 previously and substituting @xmath205 , we obtain finally the cm energy near the horizon : @xmath209 whenever we taking the extremal limit @xmath210 , we get the cm energy near the horizon : @xmath211 which implies that the cm energy of collision for extremal dilation black hole blows up as we approach the extremal limit .    again",
    ", it is well known that for extremal gmghs space - time @xcite the isco , circular photon orbit(cpo ) and marginally bound circular orbit(mbco ) coincide with the same radius i.e. @xmath212 . if we choose the different collision point say isco or cpo or mbco , then the cm energy will be unlimited for each collision point .",
    "now we have compared the @xmath1 for different collision point : @xmath213 since for this extreme bh , the collision point is at same location thus the cm energy gives the diverging value at each collision point which is quite different from extreme rn bh and schwarzschild bh .",
    "in this paper , we have performed the collision of two neutral particles falling freely from rest at infinity in the background of the charged dilation bh .",
    "firstly , we have studied the complete geodesic structure of the charged dilation bhs both time - like case and null case respectively .",
    "isco , mbco and cpo of the said bhs also have been computed .",
    "then we have discussed the extremal cases for both massive particles and massless particles .",
    "next , we have calculated the cm energy in the center - of - mass frame for charged dilation bhs .",
    "we have found that the @xmath1 is diverging for the extremal situation , whereas @xmath1 is finite for the non - extremal situation .",
    "there are two distinct outcome we have seen .",
    "when @xmath32 , we recover the value of @xmath1 for rn bh and for extremal case , it gives the diverging value .",
    "again , when @xmath32 , we retrieve the value of @xmath1 for gmghs bh .",
    "interestingly , for this extreme bh we showed that in @xcite the isco , photon orbit and marginally bound circular orbit were coincident with the event horizon i.e @xmath214 .",
