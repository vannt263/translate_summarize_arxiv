    "capillarity is an important physical phenomena , which occurs when two different materials contact and do not mix . given a container @xmath0 with an incompressible liquid drop @xmath1 in it , the interface of the liquid and",

    "the interface @xmath2 is of constant mean curvature and the contact angle of @xmath2 to the boundary @xmath3 is constant .",
    "one should compare this setting with soap bubble ( resp .",
    "soap film ) , where the surface has no boundary ( resp .",
    "fixed boundary ) and constant mean curvature .",
    "the literature for the study of capillarity is extensive and we refer to the book of finn @xcite , where the treatment of the theory is mainly in the nonparametric case and in the more general situation of presence of gravity .",
    "also we mention @xcite for a more recent survey about this topic .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the special case that the container @xmath0 is a unit euclidean ball and no gravity is involved .",
    "we study the ( weak ) stability for capillary hypersurfaces .",
    "this problem has been discussed by ros and souam @xcite , where they dealt with surface case and obtained some topological and geometrical restrictions . for the hypersurface case with free boundary ( the contact angle is @xmath4 ) ,",
    "ros and vergasta also proved some interesting results in @xcite .    applying the same argument as in the proof of proposition 1.1 in @xcite , we know that the hyperplanes and the spherical caps in a unit euclidean ball are capillarily stable .",
    "recently , marinov @xcite proved that , for surface case , all other known examples are unstable .",
    "we generalize marinov s result to the hypersurface case .",
    "in fact we prove the following theorem .",

    "we also note that his argument relies on the conformal coordinates , which can not be generalized to the higher dimensional case .    applying theorem [ thm1 ] to delaunay hypersurfaces , we get the following corollary [ cor1 ] . recall that delaunay hypersurfaces are the ones of revolution with constant mean curvature . by proposition 4.3 in @xcite ,",

    "this summation technique can be compared with j.  simons work @xcite . at last , under the hypothesis of theorem [ thm1 ] we can derive the instability of the hypersurface .",
    "our argument indicates that this conformal field is very important and we can use it to conclude that the mass center of minimal submanifolds with free boundary in a unit euclidean ball is at the origin ( see proposition [ prop1 ] ) .",

    "then by @xcite , @xmath2 is area minimizing for partitioning problem in @xmath88 .",
    "thus @xmath2 is stable in @xmath88 , which is equivalent to the inequality .",
    "next assume @xmath2 is a spherical cap in @xmath6 with @xmath85 the radius of the sphere containing @xmath2 and @xmath70 the contact angle .",
