    "the end result of the evolution of stars that produce white dwarfs is often a type ia supernova explosion , through a single - degenerate channel ( e.g. , @xcite ) , double - degenerate channel ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or both . since stellar evolution",
    "is obviously affected by metallicity , there is no a priori reason why the rate of sne  ia should not significantly depend on metallicity . from a theoretical standpoint , a preference for high metallicity was proposed by @xcite , whose single - degenerate model required a minimum metallicity of @xmath2 in order to produce type  ia sne .",
    "a similar preference for higher metallicity was seen in the single degenerate models of @xcite .",
    "however , the strong predictions offered by these models , such as no type  ia sne in dwarf galaxies and the outskirts of spirals , were not confirmed observationally ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the viability of the single - degenerate channel to produce the majority of type ia sne has been debated from both observational ( e.g. , @xcite ) and theoretical viewpoints @xcite , while simulations of double - degenerate mergers still do not yield normal sne  ia @xcite .    from the viewpoint of stellar evolution , we expect an opposite sign for the dependence of the rate of type ia sne on metallicity .",
    "stars of lower metallicity at a given mass generally produce more massive white dwarfs according to stellar evolution calculations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which should make it easier for them to reach the chandrasekhar mass and explode .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , a single star with an initial mass of @xmath3 will leave behind a @xmath4 white dwarf when evolved at solar metallicity ( @xmath5 ) , while a star with the same initial mass at much lower metallicity ( @xmath6 ) will leave behind a @xmath7 white dwarf . due to the steepness of the stellar initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", this leads to a larger number of possible sn  ia progenitors .",
    "obviously , producing a type ia sn explosion is a more complicated process than just evolving single stars ( for example , see the discussion of common envelope phase treatment in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the observed rate of type ia sne implies that a large fraction ( @xmath8% ) of all @xmath9 stars will explode as one ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which suggests that the binary evolution leading to sn  ia production can not be `` fragile '' .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that the type ia supernova rate has a strong dependence on stellar metallicity and examine the resulting observational implications .",
    "this is motivated by measurements of the nearby type ia supernova rates reported by the lick observatory sn search ( loss : @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements and their interpretation are discussed in section  [ section : ii ] . in section  [ section : iii ] , we present a simple model that examines the sn  ia rate as a function of galaxy mass / age , and incorporate the effects of metallicity in section  [ section : iv ] . in section",
    "[ section : v ] , we extend this into a treatment of the cosmic sn  ia rate , including the relative effects on `` prompt '' and `` delayed '' sne .",
    "we summarize our arguments and include further discussion on analogous observations , sne  ia in galactic halos , galactic chemical evolution , and super - chandrasekhar sne in section  [ section : vi ] .",
    "at present , the most complete and systematic search for nearby supernovae was conducted over the past decade by the lick observatory sn search , with results recently detailed in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly discuss the implications of the loss findings for our present study .",
    "of particular interest are the results pertaining to type ia supernovae .    in fig .",
    "[ iarate ] , we display the specific sn  ia rate ( rate per unit mass ) versus galaxy mass as measured by loss @xcite .",
    "one is first struck by the steep dependence of this specific rate on galaxy mass .",
    "this variation of over an order of magnitude demands a physical explanation .",
    "the cause should be distinct from the origin of a similar pattern seen in the specific core - collapse supernova rate by loss , which likely arises mainly from the dependence of the specific star formation rate on galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "delay time distribution alone ( _ solid line _ ) or an additional dependence on stellar metallicity ( _ dashed , dotted lines _ ; see text ) . + [ iarate],width=324 ]    importantly , we also see that at a fixed mass the sn  ia rate does not vary greatly between galaxies of different hubble type .",
    "this suggests that by examining a large set of galaxies one can arrive at the global behavior of sne ia .",
    "we proceed by translating the loss measured specific sn  ia rates in galaxies of various hubble types from a function of galactic mass into one of galactic _",
    "metallicity_. to do this , we convert between galactic mass and median metallicity using the relation derived from sdss data in @xcite , as shown by the upper axis of fig .",
    "[ iarate ] .",
    "this technique effectively averages over a large representative galaxy population similar to that sampled by loss .    since there is a delay from stellar birth to sn  ia explosion , a galaxy s sn  ia rate depends upon the age of its white dwarf population .",
    "this is typically quantified by an empirical or theoretical delay - time distribution ( dtd ) , which results in a sn  ia rate that can be simply written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the age of the universe when sn  ia progenitor stars first formed and @xmath12 is the dtd , which maps between the rate of star formation at time @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and the sn  ia rate at a later time @xmath15 .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) can be used to calculate the expected sn  ia rate of an individual galaxy or the universe as a whole , given a properly normalized @xmath16 ( for the cosmic sn  ia rate , we will use the star formation rate density ) .",
    "recent studies have suggested that @xmath17 roughly takes a @xmath18 form ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the physics behind this relation remains unclear , although such a distribution may naturally result from binary mergers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or a single - degenerate scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite also derive @xmath19-band light - weighted galaxy ages , which vary from @xmath20  yr at @xmath21 to @xmath22  yr at @xmath23 ( see their fig .  8) , using galactic models with an exponentially declining star formation history from a time @xmath24 with subsequent random bursts . ideally , one would have at hand the detailed history of star formation in every galaxy .",
    "this is understandably difficult to achieve with any certainty .",
    "attempts have been made in this direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however , using what amounts to an average over the galaxy population should be suitable for comparison with global rates .",
    "we will use both of the @xcite relations in estimating the expected sn  ia rate in galaxies of varying mass .",
    "we first attempt to explain the rate variations in galaxies of different mass as due to an age effect alone . if the @xcite ages corresponded to a single - age stellar population at a given galactic mass , deriving the expected sn  ia rate for a given dtd would be rather straightforward . for example , using a dtd for each galaxy of the form @xmath25 with @xmath26(1 gyr ) , and assuming that the entire galactic stellar mass , @xmath27 , arose at a single time , @xmath28 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) would lead to a galactic specific sn  ia rate at time @xmath29 of @xmath30 this description is incomplete , though .",
    "first , the sn  ia rate at present reflects the galactic mass at the time of formation , as opposed to that measured today after stellar mass loss has occurred .",
    "we correct for this using the results of @xcite for a chabrier imf ( as used in the sdss galaxy sample ) by including a term of the form @xmath31 .",
    "additionally , the ages are more accurately galactic averages , so that an assumption of instantaneous formation at @xmath28 will not properly reflect the effect of a dtd . to allow for a finite duration of star formation",
    ", we use a declining history of the form @xmath32 , with @xmath33  gyr , occurring since the time @xmath28 for each galaxy .",
    "we further make use of the 16/84% ranges in log  @xmath28 reported in @xcite in order to weight the galaxy population with the dtd at fixed mass ( rather than using only the median value ) .",
    "these should alleviate the effect of average ages by giving greater weight to the low - age tail of their derived distribution and by allowing for a non - negligible rate of star formation today , particularly for lower - mass galaxies , that is in rough agreement with the specific star formation rates measured by @xcite .",
    "this leaves the issue of the efficiency of converting a stellar population into sne ia ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as we will discuss in section  [ section : iv ] , the dtd is also involved in shaping the cosmic sn  ia history , with @xmath34 again setting the overall normalization . rather than attempting to incorporate theoretical models of the dtd ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , we use a dtd with a pure power law of the form @xmath35 , with a lower cutoff @xmath36 to account for the minimum amount of time needed to produce co wds .",
    "evidence for delay times as short as @xmath37100  myr has been reported from , e.g. , the study of sn remnants in the magellanic clouds @xcite , and we simply use @xmath38  myr ( see also the discussion in section  [ section : v ] ) .",
    "the results of using this approach are shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ iarate ] , where we have used a @xmath39 dtd with @xmath40yr@xmath41 . a parametrization for this model",
    "is given in the appendix .",
    "we see that the saturation in age at high masses results in a plateau , which should be a rather robust feature due to the relatively small scatter in estimated ages around @xmath42  gyr in this range , while the decrease in age at lower mass results in a rise in the sn  ia rate .",
    "overall , this simplified model agrees rather well with the loss data .",
    "historically , studies have focussed upon deriving the dtd without taking into account the possible effects of stellar metallicity on the sn  ia rate in a galaxy , as we have done above .",
    "as we next show , this assumption may not be sufficient to determine the actual dtd and to extract its astrophysical origins .",
    "we distinguish here between metallicity effects as primary ( those involved in the rate of explosions ) and secondary ( those affecting the detailed properties of individual explosions ; e.g. , @xcite ) , with our interest being in the former .",
    "we now examine a plausible scenario for including a sn  ia rate that varies with stellar metallicity .",
    "we propose that this arises from the effect of metallicity on the white dwarf produced . in general",
    ", it is expected that , for the same initial stellar mass , the white dwarf from a star of lower metallicity should be more massive .",
    "this may be due to decreased mass loss and/or opacity resulting in hotter burning over the lifetime of the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this is that it should be easier to reach the requisite chandrasekhar mass for explosion through the addition of mass via binary evolution or a double white dwarf merger .    to obtain a semi - quantitative estimate of the resulting change in the sn  ia rate with metallicity , we must consider the effect of a varying wd mass over the range of metallicities for the galaxies in the loss sample . one may hope for guidance from the initial - final wd mass relation determined from young star clusters . however , the clusters in which detailed studies are possible are nearby and formed recently , which necessarily limits them to single , @xmath43solar metallicity stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we utilize the theoretical results of @xcite in combination with the empirical metallicity estimates in @xcite . in decreasing the initial stellar metallicity from @xmath44 to 0.004 ,",

    "assuming @xmath56 and @xmath28 to be separable , we use the 16/84% ranges in log  @xmath56 from @xcite to again weight the galaxy distribution at fixed mass and introduce an overall term to account for the effect of metallicity in eq .",

    "after accounting for the weaker effects of the dtds used , the rate does indeed rise more steeply at lower galactic masses than by taking into account age alone .",
    "this can be interpreted as a relative change in efficiency , an effect at the factor of @xmath432 level over the mass range of fig .",
    "[ iarate ] for the @xmath60 model and slightly less for the @xmath64 case .",
    "because galaxy mass is strongly correlated with both age and metallicity , it is inevitable that the models are relatively degenerate and that inferences about the dtd from galaxy populations may err without accounting for metallicity . our simplified treatment of galactic star formation histories may somewhat underpredict sn  ia rates at intermediate masses .",
    "this may be refined through more detailed modeling , although , given the uncertainties in our inputs , we will not attempt to do so here .",
    "it is encouraging that such broad agreement with data is already seen using quite general assumptions .",
    "we note here that the normalization of these models can be scaled up or down , although this will directly affect the normalization of the expected cosmic sn  ia rates through the dtd , as we will discuss in the following section .",
    "note also that care should be taken in comparing these results , which examine the galaxy population as a whole , to those that distinguish between `` passive '' and `` star - forming '' galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the above is essentially based on an assumption of a single - degenerate scenario .",
    "while the full effects of metallicity on a double - degenerate scenario are likely more complicated , if we consider binaries with a uniform mass ratio distribution , the number that will exceed the chandrasekhar limit depends on metallicity as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the slope of the imf , @xmath69 approximates the slope of the white dwarf initial - final mass relation of @xcite , and @xmath70 is the dependence of the final mass on metallicity , estimated from @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the effect is very similar to the case already considered , so we do not repeat the calculations .",
    "this model does not include any effect of the higher implied masses on the rate of binary evolution or possible effects in triple systems based on the kozai mechanism @xcite .    to illustrate the above effect",
    ", we begin with the three known double wd binaries in which each component has a mass of at least @xmath71 from @xcite .",
    "these have primary / secondary masses of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 @xmath75@xmath76 , the last being a single - lined system with only a lower limit for the secondary .",
    "we assume that each wd arose from a solar - metallicity star and map from the wd masses to the initial stellar masses using the results of @xcite , mapping then to the wd masses calculated for these stellar masses at other metallicities .",
    "the @xmath71 cut allows a straightforward translation without regards to systems with low - mass he wds , etc . keeping the initial binary separations fixed , we calculate the merger time due to gravitational wave losses for each system ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . fig .",
    "[ masses ] displays the effect on these systems using this prescription , where it is seen that the total masses of all three systems would have been pushed beyond the chandrasekhar mass limit and the merger time would have been significantly reduced at lower metallicities .",
    "there is hope for new tests to reduce the uncertainty in the overall effect of metallicity .",
    "for example , in observations of sn  ia host galaxies we would expect the hosts of sn  ia to be slightly less metal - rich than the galaxy population as a whole for fixed galaxy mass .",
    "this effect would not be as marked as in the case of gamma - ray bursts ( see @xcite ) , since no hard upper metallicity threshold prohibiting the production of a sn  ia progenitor system is known to exist .",
    "an exception to this may be found at very high metallicity , as evidenced by the abundance of he rather than co wds in the metal - rich cluster ngc  6791 ( see @xcite )  very massive , metal - rich galaxies may show an additional deficit of sne  ia beyond that of our simple model .",
    "this may even be evident in the data at the high - mass end of fig .",
    "[ iarate ] , although it is difficult to draw a strong conclusion at present .",
    "we also note that the model that we have used only results in a rather modest rate change with metallicity . it does not attempt to account for changes in the remnant mass that occur during the agb phase of an isolated star ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which could result in a larger metallicity effect .",
    "since both sn  ia scenarios require binary evolution at some step in their evolution , this model should be adequate in this respect .",
    "we also have not attempted to vary the binary fraction with stellar mass or metallicity .",
    "this is not yet well understood either theoretically or empirically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , particularly in the mass range of the progenitors of sne  ia , suggesting that substantial room for improvement exists on both fronts in this regime .",

    "[ iarate ] and fig .",

    "the rate of type ia supernovae should be affected at some level by the effects of metallicity on stellar evolution . there may be various complications involved , such as the largely unresolved effects of binary evolution , but our simple model for the effects of metallicity should be broadly relevant",

    "the properties of sn  ia have been seen to depend on metallicity , why not the rate ?",
    "the simple models that we have considered explain fairly well both the specific sn  ia rates measured in nearby galaxies by loss and the observed normalization and evolution of the cosmic sn  ia rate .",
    "further progress can certainly be made with data that can break the degeneracy between decreasing metallicity and decreasing age .",
    "indeed , evidence in this direction has been found in a comparison of sn  ia host galaxies in sdss by @xcite , who found that sne  ia in blue , star - forming hosts have a preference for lower - density environments , which they interpreted as being the effect of lower gas - phase metallicities .",
    "as previously mentioned , the results of @xcite indicate that the maximum co wd mass remains close to @xmath99 over a wide range of metallicities .",
    "if this is true , and binary evolution effects are neglected , then we would expect the relative rates of super - chandrasekhar sne  ia arising from mergers to increase with lower metallicity in proportion to the normal sne  ia due to the power law form of the imf ( note that instabilities prohibit the necessary growth of even rapidly - rotating single wds ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations of host galaxies may indicate an even stronger preference for low - metallicity hosts for super - chandrasekhar sne  ia ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the maximum mass resulting from a merger under these assumptions is @xmath105 , well below that inferred from sn  2007if @xcite .",
    "an explanation for both effects may arise from binary evolution . to achieve a higher total merger mass , without resorting to an onemg wd , at least one wd should gain mass while maintaining a co composition . if the effect of inhibiting single degenerate sn  ia production at @xmath106 @xcite does hold , then the primary wd may instead be pushed close to , but not above , the threshold for explosion , so that the rate of massive mergers is further enhanced .",
    "the end state of the secondary resulting in a massive co wd could then lead to a merger with total mass upwards of @xmath107 .",
    "if , contrary to @xcite , the co wd mass limit actually increases modestly for lower metallicities , then the rate of such extreme super - chandrasekhar mergers rises dramatically at lower metallicities without a need to turn to binary evolution for a solution .",
    "this is due to the presence of the threshold in reaching the requisite total merger mass , which would lead to a large relative difference between low / high-@xmath46 galaxies .",
    "the stars giving rise to these massive white dwarfs would also evolve more rapidly and could thus lead to `` prompter '' explosions in low-@xmath46 environments .",
    "whether this scenario occurs is a question left for stellar evolutionary modeling and observations of host galaxies .",

    "since model fits to these measurements are naturally sensitive to the sn  ia rate over a range of metallicities , we urge exploration of the implications of an increased rate at low  @xmath46 , including super - chandrasekhar mergers , on galactic chemical evolution .    in the category of interesting , but",
    "more anecdotal , evidence that low metallicity might be of significance for type ia supernovae , @xcite recently presented strong evidence that sbs1150 + 599a , a close binary star inside a metal - poor , galactic halo planetary nebula pn g135.9 + 55.9 consists of two white dwarfs that will merge within a hubble time .",
    "the estimated total mass of the binary is very close to the chandrasekhar limit , making it a likely sn  ia progenitor .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the normalized rate of planetary nebulae in elliptical galaxies @xcite shows a very similar trend with metallicity to that discussed in our fig .  1 . indeed , their figs",
    "11 and 12 show about 10 times fewer planetary nebulae per unit luminosity in metal - rich , massive ellipticals compared to metal - poor , low - mass ellipticals .",
    "the mapping between pn production and sn  ia explosion is of course uncertain ; however , both involve the production of a white dwarf , and @xcite attribute finding fewer pne in more metal rich ellipticals to a dependence of the initial - to - final mass relation on metallicity .",
    "substantial observational progress has been made in the study of sne  ia in the last decade and new data can be expected to better determine the extent to which metallicity affects the sn  ia rate .",
    "possible directions include detailed measurements of rates as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "related to this is the expectation of a relatively higher sn  ia rate in galactic halos , for a given stellar population age and total mass , due to the lower average metallicity .",
    "such a bias may already be seen in the number of cases in which a sn  ia occurred in the outer halo of a star - forming galaxy @xcite .",
