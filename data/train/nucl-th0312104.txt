    "it is known that much of the hadronic dynamics at low energies is determined by nucleon and meson exchanges while the intermediate - energy region is dominated by various resonances .",
    "chiral symmetry is an important physical constraint that governs the meson - nucleon interactions at low energies and unitarity is an essential property at intermediate energies .",
    "a natural link between the low- and intermediate - energy regions is provided by various sum rules . in this paper",
    "we present a dynamical study of two sum rules for pion - nucleon scattering : the adler - weisberger ( aw ) and goldberger - miyazawa - oehme ( gmo ) sum rules  @xcite .",
    "these relate integrals over the total cross section to the scattering amplitude calculated at a subthreshold kinematic point ( in the case of the aw sum rule ) and at threshold ( in the case of the gmo sum rule ) , in the isospin - odd channel .",
    "the sum rules follow from the properties of relativistic invariance , unitarity , analyticity and crossing symmetry ( from whose combination , and assuming no subtractions , one derives a dispersion relation for the isospin - odd amplitude ) , augmented by chiral symmetry constraints .",
    "the latter may be taken into account either by using the current algebra commutator for axial charges and the pcac relation for the divergence of the axial current  @xcite or by using a chirally invariant lagrangian at tree level  @xcite . in deriving the sum",
    "rules one assumes that due to the smallness of the pion mass @xmath1 , the non - pole part of the amplitude is a slowly varying function of external pion four - momenta throughout the low - energy region of other variables , thus retaining only the terms of the lowest order in @xmath1 .",
    "the higher orders corrections come from effects of finite nucleon size ( by estimating the pion - nucleon form factor  @xcite or by evaluating pion loops  @xcite ) and from resonance contributions ( of which the @xmath0 is expected to be dominant  @xcite ) .",
    "being based on the very general physical principles , the sum rules can serve as stringent tests of dynamical models of pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "suppose one obtains the low - energy quantities predicted by the sum rules in two ways : first , from the calculated low - energy scattering amplitude itself and , second , by integrating the calculated total cross sections with the appropriate weight .",
    "in doing so , it is essential that the two ways of evaluation ( called here the  low - energy \" and  sum - rule \" evaluations ) be done within the _ same _ dynamical model .",
    "then the results of the low - energy and sum - rule evaluations would coincide provided i ) the basic physical properties from which the sum rules are derived hold true , and ii ) the model fulfils these properties exactly . in any practical situation",
    "there will be a certain discrepancy between the low - energy and the sum - rule results .",
    "this discrepancy allows one to quantify violations of either one or both conditions i ) and ii ) .",
    "such a study was first done for nucleon compton scattering , where the anomalous magnetic moment and polarisabilities of the nucleon are related to the gerasimov - drell - hearn and baldin - lapidus sum rules  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to carry out a similar investigation for the adler - weisberger and goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rules .",
    "we use the  dressed k - matrix model \"  @xcite which is unique in that it provides a good description of pion - nucleon scattering in _ both _",
    "intermediate- and low - energy regions , while also yielding the nucleon sigma - term in agreement with recent experimental analyses .",
    "the model obeys relativistic invariance , unitarity and crossing symmetry exactly , and incorporates constraints from analyticity and chiral symmetry approximately .",
    "we interpret the violation of analyticity and chiral symmetry in terms of meson - loop corrections to the free nucleon and @xmath0 propagators and to bare @xmath2 and @xmath3 vertices .",
    "the calculation of the loops is done up to infinite order within a consistent dressing procedure . as a result of the present study",
    ", we find that the dressing improves the agreement between the low - energy and sum - rule calculations .",
    "we will focus on the effects of the @xmath0-resonance dressing in some detail .",
    "the sum rules discussed in this paper are formulated in terms of the isospin - odd amplitude @xmath4 for forward pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "we denote the nucleon and pion masses as @xmath5 and @xmath1 , respectively ( @xmath6 mev , @xmath7 mev ) , and the pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath8  @xcite ( this value of @xmath9 is also compatible with refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the following",
    "we shall use the invariant energy variable @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the mandelstam variables , constrained by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the initial and final pion four - momenta , respectively ( @xmath16 for on - shell pions ) .",
    "we shall also use @xmath17 , the energy of the incoming pion in the laboratory frame .",
    "the total cross sections for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering processes will be denoted as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the adler - weisberger ( aw ) sum rule for pion - nucleon scattering  @xcite can be written as a relation between the integral over the weighted total cross section and the low - energy limit of the isospin - odd scattering amplitude : c_aw = i_aw , where the left - hand side represents a low - energy limit of the forward scattering amplitude : c_aw = 2 f_^2 _ 0 \\ { + } , and the right - hand side is given by the sum - rule integral i_aw = 2 f_^2 \\ { _ ^d + } , where @xmath22 mev is the pion decay constant . the presence of the factor @xmath23 and of the nucleon pole contribution @xmath24 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : int_aw ] ) is a matter of convenience since for a vanishing pion mass chiral symmetry dictates that  @xcite c_aw = 1 + ( ^2/m^2 ) .",
    "thus the dominant correction to is of the order @xmath25 , reflecting the fact that the physical pion has a non - vanishing mass whereas the aw sum rule is derived formally for the scattering of a massless pion .",
    "the goldberger - miyazawa - oehme ( gmo ) sum rule  @xcite can be written in the form c_gmo = i_gmo , where the low - energy part is determined by the isospin - odd scattering length @xmath26 : c_gmo = 4 a^- , and the sum - rule integral is given by i_gmo = ^2 \\ { _ ^d + } .",
    "similar to @xmath27 in , @xmath28 is related to a low - energy value of the scattering amplitude since @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath29 at threshold : a^- = .",
    "the last equation also shows that the gmo sum rule is written up to higher - order terms of @xmath30 .",
    "this could be compared with the accuracy @xmath25 of the aw sum rule , as indicated in .",
    "it should be pointed out that some terms in the sum rules might formally appear of a lower order in @xmath31 than they actually are : for example , the leading terms in might be interpreted as being of @xmath32 , but the explicit evaluation shows that , due to large accompanying coefficients , they are comparable with unity ( see ) . by the same token , a proper care should be taken in estimating the leading corrections to the sum rules eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sr_gmo ] ) .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic accuracy of the sum rules was presented recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the gmo sum rule was utilised to deduce the pion - nucleon coupling constant . for the purposes of the present paper ,",
    "the precise value of @xmath9 is not very important since we focus on the comparison of the low - energy and sum - rule evaluations ; it is essential however that we keep all parameters ( including @xmath9 ) unchanged in evaluating both left- and right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sr_gmo ] ) .",
    "the objective of our calculation is to check the validity of the aw and gmo sum rules using a dynamical model for pion - nucleon interaction applicable at low and intermediate energies .",
    "the crucial point is that the evaluation of the left- and right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sr_gmo ] ) is done here in the _ same _ model , rather than utilising one approach to evaluate the low - energy limits of the amplitudes ( the left - hand sides ) and another approach to evaluate the integrals ( the right - hand sides ) . only if eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sr_gmo ] ) are calculated entirely within the same model will their validity reflect the extent to which the basic symmetries are fulfilled in the chosen model , rather than stem from ( possible ) incompatibility of different approaches .",
    "we use the  dressed k - matrix model \" whose detailed description can be found in refs .",
    "here we recapitulate only the principal features of the approach .",
    "the properties of relativistic invariance , ( two - body ) unitarity and crossing symmetry are fulfilled in the model exactly , while those of chiral symmetry and analyticity are implemented partially .",
    "chiral symmetry constraints are effectively incorporated at low energies through the use of a predominantly pseudovector pion - nucleon coupling in the s- and u - channel nucleon exchange diagrams , plus @xmath33 and @xmath34 t - channel exchanges with parameters fitted to provide a good low - energy description of the s- and p - wave phase shifts  @xcite .",
    "effects of the explicit violation of chiral symmetry appear due to the finiteness of the pion mass . in the context of the aw sum rule , these effects manifest themselves in the deviation of @xmath27 from unity , as shown in .",
    "analyticity is implemented in the model through the dressing procedure for the @xmath2 and @xmath35 vertices and the nucleon and @xmath0 propagators .",
    "these three- and two - point functions are calculated as a solution of a system of coupled integral equations , which amounts to including meson loop corrections up to infinite order ( for a specific description of the class of the loops generated by the dressing , see refs .",
    "the solution is based on the use of cutting rules and dispersion relations in an iteration procedure , which allows us to obtain analytic two- and three - point functions ( i.e.  the dressed propagators and vertices , respectively ) .",
    "the scattering amplitude is obtained in a k - matrix framework , where the k matrix is constructed from skeleton diagrams built out of the dressed vertices and propagators . as a result of the dressing",
    ", analyticity is partially incorporated into the k - matrix framework ( as opposed to the traditional k - matrix models where analyticity is strongly violated because of k matrices built out of tree diagrams ) .",
    "the full restoration of analyticity could be achieved by dressing the four - point irreducible functions in the amplitude on the same footing with the presently dressed two- and three - point functions ( see discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the calculation presented in this paper provides a useful means of quantifying the extent to which analyticity and chiral symmetry are broken in the model .",
    "indeed , since the sum rules are based on the combination of relativistic invariance , unitarity , crossing symmetry , analyticity and chiral symmetry , and only the latter two properties are not fully implemented in the model , the difference between the evaluation of the low - energy amplitudes ( represented by the left - hand sides of of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sr_gmo ] ) ) and the evaluation of the sum - rule integrals ( the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sr_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sr_gmo ] ) ) will serve as a measure of the violation of analyticity and chiral symmetry constraints .",
    "such a comparison of low - energy and sum - rule evaluations was carried out earlier for the baldin - lapidus , gerasimov - drell - hearn and other related sum rules in compton scattering  @xcite . the main difference between the present case of the aw and gmo sum rules and that of the sum rules in compton scattering is that now we test not only the violation of analyticity but also effects of the explicit chiral symmetry breakdown .",
    "we will study the effects of the dressing of the two- and three - point functions by comparing three different calculations , called the  dressed \" ,  bare \" and  dressed , but bare @xmath0 \" calculations .",
    "the  bare \" calculation corresponds to the use of free propagators and bare vertices in the k matrix , whereas the  dressed \" one to the use of the fully dressed vertices and propagators .",
    "the  bare \" calculation is equivalent to a traditional k - matrix model with a tree - level k matrix ; therefore , the violation of analyticity is maximal in this case .",
    "analyticity is partially restored in the  dressed \" calculation since the dressing of the two- and three - point functions incorporates the use of dispersion relations .",
    "the remaining violation of analyticity comes mainly from the lack of the dressing of the four - point contact diagrams .",
    "the  dressed , but bare @xmath0 \" calculation highlights effects of the dressing of the @xmath0 resonance and will be described in the next subsection . since we want to consider the genuine effects of the dressing , the same set of parameters are used in the  dressed \" ,  bare \" and  dressed , but bare @xmath0 \" calculations ( all coupling constants , including the masses , the coupling constants and the cut - offs of the bare form factors , are given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to investigate convergence of the sum rules",
    ", we calculate the integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : int_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : int_gmo ] ) up to a pion energy @xmath36 .",
    "the dependence of the calculated aw and gmo sum rules on @xmath36 is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sr_aw ] and [ fig : sr_gmo ] , respectively .",
    "even though a full convergence is not achieved by @xmath37 mev , the major features of the sum - rules are obtained due to the nucleon and the @xmath0-resonance , as can be seen from where we show the calculated total cross sections .",
    "the hump in the cross sections around @xmath38 mev is not reproduced since we did not include the d15 and f15 resonances in the model at present .",
    "we checked however that this higher - energy feature of the cross section is suppressed by the weight factors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : int_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : int_gmo ] ) .",
    "this observation is in complete agreement with the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that the resonances heavier than the @xmath0 have a negligible effect on the sum rules .",
    "we extract the values of the sum rules at two representative pion energies , @xmath39 mev and @xmath40 mev , and regard them as the results of the sum - rule evaluation , i.e.  as @xmath41 and @xmath42 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : int_aw ] ) and ( [ eq : int_gmo ] ) , respectively .",
    "the low - energy quantity @xmath28 was calculated at threshold , according to , and the low - energy values of @xmath27 , as given by , were calculated at two subthreshold points : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the former is the cheng - dashen point and the latter is closely related to the weinberg point , except that at the weinberg point both pions have a zero four - momentum squared whereas in our case the pions are on - shell .",
    "all these values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given in .",
    ".the values of the adler - weisberger and goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rules evaluated from the amplitude at the low - energy kinematical points and from the integrals over total cross sections , as given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c_aw ] ) , ( [ eq : int_aw ] ) , ( [ eq : c_gmo ] ) and ( [ eq : int_gmo ] ) .",
    "the different low - energy values @xmath45 and sum - rule values @xmath46 are described in the text , as are the three calculations with varying amounts of dressing .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the significance of these differences should be assessed in the context of the intrinsic accuracy of the sum rules , which is @xmath47 for the aw sum rule and @xmath48 for the gmo sum rule , as discussed in sections [ sec : aw_sr ] and [ sec : gmo_sr ] .",
    "we see that the agreement comparable with the intrinsic accuracy is achieved in the ",
    "dressed calculation when comparing the low - energy evaluation and the sum - rule evaluation with @xmath40 mev .",
    "by contrast , in the  bare \" calculation the discrepancy between the low - energy and sum - rule evaluations is about three to ten times larger than the intrinsic accuracy .",
    "this shows the importance of the dressing , mainly because it improves analyticity properties of the amplitudes while maintaining unitarity and crossing symmetry .      since leading corrections to the sum rules",
    "are expected to be due to the @xmath0 resonance  @xcite , we consider the effects of the @xmath0 dressing separately .",
    "the calculation denoted  dressed , but bare @xmath0 \" is based on a k matrix with the free @xmath0 propagator and the bare @xmath35 vertex while all the other vertices and propagators remain dressed as in the full ( i.e.   dressed \" ) calculation .",
    "the @xmath0 dressing is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we will mention only a few features and present the results .",
    "the @xmath35 vertex has the following structure : v_(k , p ) ~g_(p^2)(k_p / - p k _ ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the four - momenta of the @xmath0 and pion , respectively , and @xmath51 is the @xmath35 form factor .",
    "this vertex has the property @xmath52 , which ensures that only the physical spin-@xmath53 part is retained in the @xmath0 propagator  @xcite s^_(p ) = , where @xmath54 is the projector on the spin-@xmath53 states , @xmath55 mev is the mass of the @xmath0 resonance and the @xmath0 self - energy is given by _ ( p ) = a_(p^2 ) p / + b_(p^2 ) m_- ( z^_2 - 1)(p /-m_)-z^_2 m _ .",
    "the invariant self - energy functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 describe the pion loop contribution , and the renormalisation constants @xmath58 and @xmath59 are fixed to ensure the correct pole location and residue of the dressed propagator .",
    "the @xmath35 vertex gets dressed with an infinite number of meson loops , i.e.  a starting bare form factor @xmath60 changes into @xmath51 . correspondingly , the vertex changes its normalisation from a bare coupling constant to a physical one , the former being adjusted so that the dressed vertex yields the physical @xmath61 decay rate .",
    "it is important that the @xmath0 self - energy @xmath62 and dressed @xmath35 vertex are calculated simultaneously with the nucleon self - energy and dressed @xmath2 vertex ; all these two- and three - point functions are obtained as a solution of one system of coupled integral equations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the results of the  dressed , but bare @xmath0 \" calculation , presented in figs .  [ fig : sr_aw ] , [ fig : sr_gmo ] and in tables  [ tab : lesr_comp ] , [ tab : lesr_diff ] , show that the @xmath0 dressing has a small effect on the aw and gmo sum rules .",
    "thus while the full (  dressed \" ) calculation is clearly superior to the  bare \" one , the @xmath0 dressing considered in separation does not improve the agreement between the low - energy and sum - rule evaluations .",
    "however , the dressed and bare @xmath35 form factors differ noticeably , as shown in . at the @xmath0 mass , @xmath63 gev@xmath64 ,",
    "the physical form factor is normalised to one by adjusting the normalisation of the bare form factor .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy has a nontrivial structure as shown in .",
    "the effects of the @xmath0 dressing manifest themselves quite prominently in the @xmath65 pion - nucleon phase shift , shown in , which is known to be determined mainly by the @xmath0 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "we use the same set of parameters in the  dressed \" ,  bare \" and  dressed , but bare @xmath0 \" calculations . the only exception is made in presenting the @xmath65 phase shift , where we normalised the bare and physical @xmath35 form factor to the same value at the @xmath0 mass to ensure that both curves in pass through 90 degrees with the correct slope at @xmath66 mev .",
    "it is generally accepted that one can derive the adler - weisberger and goldberger - miyazawa - oehme sum rules from relativistic invariance , unitarity , analyticity , crossing symmetry and chiral symmetry constraints .",
    "then the difference between the low - energy and the sum - rule calculations ( i.  e.  between the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) is a quantitative measure of the extent to which these properties are violated in the present model . since relativistic invariance , two - body unitarity and crossing are exact in the model , the discrepancy between the low - energy and sum - rule evaluations is due to the partial fulfilment of analyticity and chiral symmetry .",
    "the dressing certainly improves analyticity properties of the amplitude , although as explained in , it does not restore analyticity completely .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken in the model due to the finiteness of the pion mass .",
    "this is reflected in the difference @xmath67 .",
    "notably , the modulus of this difference is of the same order as the discrepancy between either @xmath68 or @xmath69 and the sum - rule values @xmath41 .",
    "it is also comparable with the measure of convergence of the sum - rule integral , i.e.  with @xmath70 .",
    "thus the extent to which the dressing affects the chiral symmetry constraints is more difficult to quantify than that of analyticity .",
    "nevertheless , our calculations indicate that the explicit chiral symmetry breaking has a small influence on the aw and gmo sum rules .",
    "we have also shown that the corrections due to the @xmath0 resonance , including its dressing , are strongly suppressed .",
    "it would be interesting to conduct comparisons between low - energy and sum - rule evaluations within other approaches to pion - nucleon scattering , such as the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite or its reductions ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , traditional k - matrix models  @xcite or approaches based on chiral lagrangians ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such a comparison would however be meaningful only if , similarly to the  dressed k - matrix model \" used in the present study , a chosen approach is applicable at both low and intermediate energies because one should be able to calculate reliably both the low - energy amplitude and the total cross sections in the _ same _ framework .",
