    "owing to their unique properties , alkaline - earth - like atoms have become the subject of intense experimental and theoretical research in recent years .",
    "ultracold gases of these two - electron atoms have been proposed for the realization and study of a variety of novel quantum systems including heavy fermion materials and the kondo insulator@xcite , su(n)-symmetric hamiltonians@xcite , quantum information processing@xcite and artificial gauge fields@xcite .",
    "quantum degenerate gases have been reported by only a few groups for isotopes of ytterbium@xcite ( yb ) , strontium@xcite , and calcium@xcite .",
    "however , all of these experiments rely on zeeman slowers as the initial cooling stage .    from the early days of laser cooling@xcite",
    "it is well known that zeeman@xcite or chirp@xcite slowing of a thermal beam enhances the loading rate of a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) by many orders of magnitude as compared to loading from a background vapor directly .",
    "for alkali metals the concept of a 2d - mot@xcite has been developed as a powerful alternative which results in a similar flux of cold atoms , but in a much more compact and versatile setup . here ,",
    "atoms are transversely cooled from a background vapor into a well - collimated beam of cold atoms . because longitudinally slow atoms are cooled preferentially , the resulting velocity distribution peaks at several tens of meters per second allowing them to be captured by the 3d - mot",
    ". often , a `` pushing '' beam or moving molasses is used to enhance the yield of the cold atom source further . 2d - mots are extremely efficient , yet uniquely simple and highly tunable .",
    "in particular , a single setup can readily be used to cool multiple elements , whereas multispecies zeeman slowers require sophisticated designs .",
    "2d - mots are therefore inherently well suited for producing and studying ultracold mixtures.@xcite furthermore , high - precision spectroscopy experiments , which are prone to frequency shifts from black - body radiation , can benefit from the fact that there is no direct line of sight from the source of thermal atoms to the cold or ultracold sample .",
    "the traditional concept of a 2d - mot is limited to elements with sufficiently large vapor pressures near room temperature .",
    "alkaline - earth - like elements , except for mercury@xcite , have high melting temperatures @xmath2 ( e.g. @xmath3 for yb ) and low vapor pressures ( e.g. less than @xmath4 at @xmath5 for yb@xcite ) . at room temperature",
    "this effectively prevents any 2d - mot from being loaded from a background gas .",
    "an alternative concept has been demonstrated for lithium@xcite , where the 2d - mot is side - loaded from an oven instead of background vapor and high loading rates of up to @xmath6 have been reported .    in this paper",
    "we report on the first successful implementation of a 2d - mot loaded via a dispenser for yb and the subsequent generation of quantum degenerate gases of both bosonic @xmath7 and fermionic @xmath8 . based on numerical simulations",
    ", we have designed a very compact `` glass - cell '' setup for a 2d- and 3d - mot that allows extraordinarily large optical access for future experiments based on optical lattices .",
    "state is given for the fermionic isotope @xmath8 . ]",
    "yb is a rare - earth element with as many as seven stable isotopes .",
    "its five bosonic isotopes ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath7 , @xmath12 ) are spinless ( @xmath13 ) , while the remaining two fermionic isotopes have nuclear spins of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the electronic structure of yb is dominated by its two valence electrons and hence very similar to alkaline - earth elements . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : levelscheme ] , its level scheme consists of states with singlet and triplet electronic spin.@xcite the intercombination transitions connecting singlet and triplet states are only allowed due to imperfect @xmath17-@xmath18-coupling and thus are very weak . in particular , the transition from the ground state @xmath19 to the triplet state @xmath20 is even forbidden as a single - photon transition for the bosonic isotopes , although small transition amplitudes may be created artificially by magnetically - induced state mixing@xcite or via multi - photon schemes@xcite . in fermionic isotopes ,",
    "hyperfine interaction yields a non - zero natural linewidth of the transition on the order of @xmath21 . with a lifetime of several seconds@xcite ,",
    "it is metastable on experimentally relevant timescales and gives rise to a series of unique and intriguing features.@xcite    the ultranarrow @xmath22 transition is not only crucial for novel optical frequency standards@xcite , its fascinating properties also make it ideal for the spectroscopic analysis of quantum gases .",
    "energy levels of atoms confined to a site of an optical lattice can be probed locally in the optical domain , and due to the coherent nature of the probe even controlled manipulation of quantum states is possible .",
    "the wavelength of the lattice acts as a tool to tune the differential ac - stark shifts of the two states of the spectroscopy transition . in this way",
    ", different scenarios can be realized , e.g.  a `` magic '' lattice@xcite where the main order differential light - shift induced by the trapping potential on the transition is cancelled , thus enabling high - precision spectroscopy .",
    "moreover , state - selective lattices at wavelengths where the polarizability of either @xmath19 or @xmath20 vanishes have been proposed@xcite and allow an unprecedented degree of control of the system .    for laser cooling ,",
    "two complementary transitions are of interest .",
    "the broad principal transition @xmath0 allows an extremely strong radiation pressure . in bosonic isotopes",
    ", the lack of substructure in the ground state @xmath19 prevents any sisyphus cooling on this transition.@xcite on the other hand , the intercombination transition @xmath1 is very narrow and has a _ doppler cooling _ limit of merely @xmath23 , which provides ideal starting conditions for evaporative cooling .",
    "since the @xmath19 ground state does not allow magnetic trapping , evaporation and further experimental steps require optical dipole traps . in combination with optical lattices ,",
    "a setup with wide optical access is therefore desirable for yb experiments .",
    "3d - mot as a function of its capture velocity .",
    "results of numerical simulations are shown for magnetic field gradients of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) at detunings of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , yielding optimal maximum loading rates . ]    with two nearly closed cooling transitions , yb is a straightforward candidate for a dual mot scheme .",
    "the principal transition @xmath0 is used for cooling in the 2d - mot to achieve a strong cooling force , while the subsequent 3d - mot operates on the intercombination transition @xmath1 that allows for a final temperature in the microkelvin range .",
    "the central concept of our 2d-/3d - mot setup to overcome the low vapor pressure of yb is to use a side - loaded 2d - mot@xcite , but use dispensers instead of an oven . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d3dsketch ] , the 2d - mot is formed by a perpendicular pair of counterpropagating , circularly polarized laser beams and a 2d magnetic quadrupole field generated by rectangular coils . it is loaded transversely from a dispenser that has been installed within a glass cell . using the narrow intercombination transition ,",
    "however , the velocity capture range of the 3d - mot typically is only a few meters per second . as detailed further in section [ section:2d3dmot ]",
    ", we use laser broadening@xcite to enhance the loading rate substantially .    to find the optimal 2d - mot parameters we have performed detailed numerical simulations . using the geometry as described above , except for the absence of a pushing beam , we numerically integrated the possible trajectories of yb atoms emitted from the dispenser for different velocities assuming the mean radiation pressure in the 2d - mot .",
    "we assume that yb atoms emitted from the dispenser stick to the glass cell at their first contact , which is justified by the high desorption temperature .",
    "thus , atoms perform a `` single pass '' through the 2d - mot , in strong contrast to 2d - mots loading from a thermal background vapor .",
    "spontaneous emissions and collisions have been ignored in this calculation .",
    "we sampled the velocity distribution in steps of @xmath33 per axis up to a maximum of @xmath34 and weighted each trajectory with the flux of the source in the associated velocity bin assuming a thermal maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "the 2d - mot beams have an elliptic cross - section of @xmath35 in diameter and a homogeneous intensity of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the saturation intensity of the transition @xmath0 . from these results",
    "we then calculated the rate of atoms entering the 3d - mot volume at a velocity smaller than the capture velocity .",
    "examples of simulation results for a capture velocity @xmath38 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmot_sim_exp]a . evidently , the 2d - mot efficiently decelerates and cools a substantial amount of atoms emitted by the dispenser , and the resulting beam of atoms is indeed slow enough to subsequently be captured by the 3d - mot .",
    "the loading rate exhibits a distinct maximum at a magnetic quadrupole field gradient of @xmath26 and a detuning @xmath39 .",
    "as expected due to the large linewidth of the cooling transition , the optimal gradient is significantly higher than for typical alkali 2d - mots .",
    "experimentally obtained loading rates of our 2d-/3d - mot system for the same range of magnetic field gradients and detunings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmot_sim_exp]b , and they are in excellent agreement with the simulation . in particular , the optimal set of parameters is reproduced exactly within the resolution of the scans .",
    "[ fig : sim_capturevelocity ] shows the expected loading rates as a function of the capture velocity for several 2d - mot configurations .",
    "it illustrates a strong dependence of the optimal 2d - mot parameters on the capture velocity around @xmath40 and a saturation of the loading rate at values beyond some @xmath41 .",
    "the vacuum system of our experimental apparatus consists of two separate glass cells that are mounted to a single stainless steel vacuum chamber . fig .  [",
    "fig : vacuumsystem ] shows a cad section view of the apparatus .",
    "both cells are made from synthetic fused silica glass , and broadband anti - reflective coatings have been applied to their outer surfaces . while the 2d - mot is produced in the upper cell , the 3d - mot is located in the `` science '' cell below , and all subsequent experimental steps take place in this cell as well .    the central chamber connects the 2d - mot cell to the science cell via two differential pumping stages , equipped with graphite tubes , along its central axis .",
    "these are necessary to maintain the low pressure required to achieve sufficiently long lifetimes in the science cell ( @xmath42 ) even when the 2d - mot is in operation ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "each cell is pumped by a @xmath44 ion getter pump , and an additional titanium sublimation pump has been installed for the science cell .",
    "the chamber itself has been manufactured from solid , non - ferromagnetic steel with internal tubes to connect the pumps and other equipment to the cells .",
    "its compact designs reduces the distance between both mots to @xmath45 , which is essential for an efficient transfer of atoms from the 2d - mot into the 3d - mot .",
    "the 2d - mot cell ( @xmath46 ) contains two alvasource@xcite as-4-yb-500-s yb dispenser sources that generate the atomic beams loading the 2d - mot when heated .",
    "both dispensers are connected to a high - power feedthrough and have been mounted upright on an insulating ceramic ring with the emitter slit facing towards the center of the cell . to prevent the yb atoms from coating any critical surface of the 2d - mot cell ,",
    "aluminium plates with rectangular apertures have been installed in front of each dispenser .",
    "we typically operate the dispensers at currents of about @xmath47 , which yields a sufficiently large flux of yb . during operation , the pressure measured close to the 2d - mot cell rises from some @xmath48 to a few @xmath49 , likely due to outgassing of the dispensers , as emitted yb directly sticks to the walls .",
    "two identical pairs of external rectangular coils generate the magnetic quadrupole field for the 2d - mot .",
    "the coils are water - cooled and produce the necessary gradients of more than @xmath50 without radiating a significant amount of heat .",
    "the science cell ( @xmath51 ) provides excellent optical access to the atomic samples .",
    "a pair of helmholtz coils generates the magnetic quadrupole field for the 3d - mot , but it has been designed for large a variety of tasks , such as magnetic traps for another species or bias fields for feshbach resonances in mixtures .",
    "it is capable of producing gradients of up to @xmath52 or homogeneous fields of up to @xmath53 and does not reduce the optical access significantly .",
    "the 2d - mot is formed by two elliptical beams of about @xmath54 by @xmath55 in diameter that are retroreflected in a cat s eye configuration .",
    "we use a commercial diode laser system with a tapered amplifier that is frequency - doubled in a bow - tie cavity and provides about @xmath56 of laser power ( @xmath57 ) to each beam at a wavelength of @xmath58 .",
    "the laser is offset - locked to a master ecdl using an additional @xmath59 laser diode and can easily be scanned across a broad frequency range .",
    "the master laser itself is stabilized by fluorescence spectroscopy of an atomic beam .",
    "additional light for pushing and imaging beams is generated by an injection - locked slave laser diode of the same type .",
    "the 3d - mot has been set up in a retroreflected three - beam - configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d3dsketch ] ) .",
    "a commercial fiber laser is frequency - doubled in a waveguide and provides @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for the axial and diagonal beams with a diameter of @xmath64 .",
    "this laser is stabilized via doppler - free fluorescence spectroscopy of the atomic beam mentioned above , and its inherent narrow linewidth of less than @xmath65 is particularly useful for operating a mot at small detunings .",
    "measured as a function of the fwhm @xmath66 of the broadened laser spectrum .",
    "the high frequency edge of the spectrum is kept at a constant detuning from the @xmath1 resonance frequency . ]",
    "fluorescence in the 2d - mot cell indicates that atoms are captured in a cigar - shaped region along the axis of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the emerging flux of cold atoms can not be captured efficiently in a single - frequency 3d - mot setup operated close to the @xmath1 intercombination transition , because the narrow linewidth addresses only a very small velocity range .",
    "the capture velocity can be increased by actively broadening the frequency spectrum of the laser , as has already been reported for yb setups using zeeman slowers@xcite .",
    "this temporarily introduces additional frequency components , preferably further detuned to the red , at the expense of temperature , as detailed in section [ section : motperformance ] . due to the low saturation intensity of the transition ,",
    "there is typically enough laser power to cover a broad frequency range at a reasonable power spectral density .",
    "we use the rf signal driving the aom that controls the power in the 3d - mot beams to modulate the laser frequency across several megahertz at a modulation frequency of typically @xmath67 . to keep the minimal red detuning roughly at @xmath68",
    ", we also increase the center detuning accordingly .",
    "[ fig : motbroadening ] shows the mot loading rate as a function of the fwhm @xmath66 of the broadened laser spectrum for the bosonic isotope @xmath7 ; we attribute the reduced loading rate above @xmath69 to insufficient spectral power density .    for optimal loading from the 2d - mot",
    ", we typically operate the 3d - mot at a center detuning of @xmath70 , a broadening of @xmath71 , and a magnetic field gradient of @xmath72 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmot_sim_exp]b , the 2d - mot is operated at a magnetic field gradient of @xmath26 and a detuning of @xmath73 .",
    "because of the large linewidth of the @xmath0 transition used for the 2d - mot , higher laser power may still increase attainable loading rates significantly , however our experimental setup is currently limited by available laser power and power dissipation in the coils ( ca .",
    "@xmath74 ) . when reducing the laser power for the 2d - mot by a factor of @xmath75 , the loading rate of the 3d - mot is decreased by a factor of @xmath76 .       measured as a function of power in the pushing beam .",
    "loading rates are normalized to the value without a pushing beam . ]",
    "the transfer of atoms from the 2d - mot into the 3d - mot can be enhanced significantly by a weak additional beam along the axis of the 2d - mot pushing atoms through the differential pumping stage .",
    "we have implemented a single pushing beam as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2d3dsketch ] at a detuning of @xmath77 from the @xmath0 transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pushingbeam ] , the loading rate of the 3d - mot is shown as a function of power in the pushing beam .",
    "clearly , a power around @xmath78 yields an optimal and robust loading rate  the optimal power depends on its size and the details of its alignment , however , and is given here for reference only . because of the large linewidth of the @xmath0 transition , the radiation pressure of the weak pushing beam exceeds that of the 3d - mot many times .",
    "we therefore align the pushing beam such that it is blocked by the differential pumping tube and does not enter the science cell .      for the parameters discussed above , we found a typical value for the 3d - mot steady - state particle number of @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and we typically load @xmath81 bosonic @xmath7 atoms within @xmath82 .    at its optimal loading parameters ,",
    "the 3d - mot has a temperature of @xmath83 . to reduce the temperature of the sample as close to the doppler limit of @xmath84 as possible , the laser - broadening amplitude",
    "is gradually reduced to zero within several hundreds of milliseconds , while the center detuning is simultaneously shifted closer to resonance , and the power is reduced to @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the diagonal beams and beams along the symmetry axis of the coils , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the mot is compressed by increasing the field gradient to about @xmath87 . with these parameters ,",
    "the mot temperature is reduced to typically @xmath88 , comparable to temperatures published for other yb mots@xcite .",
    "for evaporative cooling and trapping of ultracold samples , we have set up a crossed optical dipole trap ( odt ) formed by a deep horizontal trap and a vertical trap that creates additional confinement in the crossing region .",
    "the horizontal trap is created by a beam of up to @xmath89 produced by a solid state laser at @xmath90 and focused down to vertical and horizontal @xmath91-waists of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . for the vertical trap ,",
    "part of the laser power is split off by a partially reflecting mirror and typically up to @xmath94 are focused to waists of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the powers in each beam are monitored by logarithmically amplified photodiodes and regulated using quartz aoms that also induce a frequency difference of about @xmath97 between the two beams .      to transfer atoms into the odt",
    "once the mot has been loaded , we abruptly switch on the dipole traps and gradually increase the magnetic field gradient to @xmath87 to strongly compress the mot , while its temperature is reduced as discussed above .",
    "both dipole traps are initially operated at their full powers of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , corresponding to potential depths of @xmath100 and @xmath101 for the horizontal and vertical traps , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 atoms are trapped in the horizontal odt at the same temperature measured for the single - frequency mot .",
    "the transfer efficiency strongly depends on the final mot parameters , in particular the magnetic field gradient .",
    "evaporative cooling is performed in two stages by lowering the depths of the odt . in the first stage , atoms are predominantly evaporated from the horizontal trap , but concentrated into the crossed region of the dipole trap as the temperature decreases .",
    "therefor we exponentially ramp the horizontal trap down to @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) within @xmath105 , but keep the vertical trap at constant depth .",
    "subsequently , atoms are evaporated from the crossed region in a second stage .",
    "within @xmath106 we exponentially reduce the depth of the horizontal trap to nominally @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and relax confinement further by lowering the power of the vertical trap to some @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "it is crucial that the confinement along the axis of the horizontal trap provided by the vertical beam is lowered during the final evaporation stage .",
    "however , the vertical trap has virtually no effect on the overall trap depth , and its final power can be varied across a large range to control the resulting trap geometry .    the absorption images in fig .",
    "[ fig : bec]a , b show the emergence of a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath7 during the final stages of the evaporation ramp .",
    "we routinely produce nearly pure condensates of @xmath111 @xmath7 atoms with no discernible thermal fraction left .",
    "the crossed dipole trap at its final parameters has an effective depth of several tens of nanokelvins and trap frequencies @xmath112 determined from dipole and quadrupole oscillations of the condensate .",
    "we have produced degenerate fermi gases of the spin-@xmath113 isotope @xmath8 using a similar sequence as for @xmath7 , because its @xmath114-wave scattering length@xcite is favorable for evaporative cooling in a spin mixture .",
    "the 2d - mot uses the @xmath0 ( @xmath115 ) hyperfine transition of @xmath8 , but its operation is complicated by the proximity of the @xmath116 hyperfine transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : levelscheme ] .",
    "this results in a strong reduction of the observed 3d - mot loading rate at detunings close to the hyperfine splitting , but efficient operation of a 2d - mot is still possible within a narrow window around the same optimal detuning as observed for bosonic @xmath7 .",
    "even more than in the case of @xmath7 , the loading rate strongly depends on the intensity of the 2d - mot beams , however .",
    "due to its lower abundance and reduced 2d - mot performance , the loading time of the @xmath8 3d - mot is significantly larger than for @xmath7 . with an earlier version ,",
    "i.e. reduced laser powers in the 2d- and 3d - mot beams , we obtained the following results : a spin mixture of about @xmath117 @xmath8 atoms was transferred from a mot of @xmath118 atoms to the dipole trap .",
    "thermalization is faster than in @xmath7 due to the enhanced scattering rate , and we used an evaporation ramp of similar shape as described above , but steeper than for the bosons .",
    "after @xmath119 of evaporation @xmath120 atoms at a temperature of @xmath121 were left . a typical absorption image of a degenerate fermi gas is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bec]c .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a novel scheme for the efficient creation of quantum gases of yb and similar alkaline - earth - like atoms based on transverse loading of a 2d - mot .",
    "loading rates observed in the subsequent 3d - mot are in agreement with numerical simulations of the 2d - mot setup .",
    "the compact 2d-/3d - mot apparatus facilitates laser cooling of additional species to study quantum - degenerate mixtures and provides excellent optical access to the combined 3d - mot and science cell .",
    "therefore , it allows a wide range of experiments to be conducted .",
    "we routinely produce bose - einstein condensates of @xmath7 and degenerate fermi gases of @xmath8 with particle numbers well suited for further experiments .",
