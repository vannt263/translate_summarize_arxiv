    "the theoretical and experimental understanding of interacting many - body quantum systems has undergone considerable development in recent years .",
    "first , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has been quite successful in describing the statistical properties of the fluctuations of the spectra of complex quantum systems , which include many - body interacting systems .",
    "examples range from nuclear physics to disordered systems , including elasto - mechanical vibrations and quantum analog systems to classical chaotic billiards ( see  @xcite for a detailed review ) .",
    "while this modeling has been quite successful , rmt is not a realistic theory since it assumes many - body forces between the constituents .",
    "more realistic stochastic model considering @xmath0 body interactions are the embedded ensembles , initially introduced by mon and french  @xcite .",
    "this model can be defined for fermions and bosons  @xcite , and may be viewed as the generic models for stochasticity in many - body systems .",
    "second , ultra - cold bosonic gases confined in optical lattices have become quite important due to the relatively simplicity to handle these systems experimentally  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in a double - well potential is a common object of study  @xcite .",
    "this system exhibits a great variety of interesting quantum phenomena , such as interference  @xcite , tunneling and self - trapping  @xcite , josephson oscillations  @xcite , and entanglement  @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , the two - level bosonic systems have been addressed using the mean field treatment of the gross - pitaevski equation  @xcite , and the two - site bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",

    "an upper one displaying nearly degenerate doublets .",
    "the latter are actually responsible for the suppression of tunneling ; it has also been shown that coherences among nearby doublets yield oscillations with very small amplitude  @xcite . taking the semiclassical limit , the system has a phase space representation similar to a pendulum , with the almost equidistant levels being associated with the libration zone and the nearly degenerate levels with the rotation zones .    in this paper",
    ", we study the statistical properties of the spectrum of @xmath1 bosons distributed on two levels coupled through random @xmath0-body interactions .",

    "this ensemble is actually a generalization of the bose - hubbard type of hamiltonians , in particular with respect to the range of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "each member of the ensemble is liouville integrable ( independently of @xmath0 ) in the classical limit  @xcite .",
    "yet , the spectral statistics of the ensemble correspond to a picket fence for @xmath2 , and follow rmt predictions for @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "these facts make the ensemble somewhat special : completely integrable systems are associated with poisson statistics , which is known as the berry - tabor conjecture  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spectral fluctuations of classically fully chaotic systems typically follow rmt predictions , which is known as the bohigas - giannoni - schmit ( or quantum - chaos ) conjecture  @xcite . we shall thus study the transition in the spectral statistics in terms of @xmath0 , considering the nearest - neighbor distribution as well as the occurrence and statistics of tunneling splittings .",
    "we shall address this for the case when the ensemble is time - reversal invariant ( @xmath14 ) or when this symmetry is broken ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we find a systematic appearance of quasi - degeneracies on a large interval of @xmath0 for the time - reversal case , which points out the underlying integrability properties of the members of the ensemble due to a theorem by shnirelman  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the number of such doublets as well as the statistics of the associated splittings display a dependence upon @xmath0 .",

    "clearly , the degenerate bose - hubbard model eq .",
    "( [ bosehubbard ] ) is a particular choice of the parameters for the combination @xmath28 .",
    "stochasticity is built into the hamiltonian @xmath29 at the level of the @xmath0-body matrix elements @xmath30 .",
    "these matrix elements are assumed to be gaussian distributed independent random variables with zero mean and constant variance @xmath31 .",
    "then , @xmath32 , where the over line denotes ensemble average .",
    "as in the case of the canonical random matrix ensembles  @xcite , dyson s parameter @xmath16 distinguishes the symmetry properties with respect to time - reversal invariance : @xmath14 corresponds to the case where time - reversal symmetry holds while the broken time - reversal case is denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath0-body interaction matrix @xmath33 is thus a member of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) for @xmath14 or gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) for @xmath15 .",
    "this defines completely the @xmath0-body embedded ensemble of random matrices for bosons distributed in @xmath34 levels . without loss of generality , in the following , we set @xmath35 .",
    "the combinatorial factors @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) are actually introduced in order to have _ an exact identity _ of the embedded ensembles with the canonical ensembles of rmt when @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the factors @xmath37 cancel the square - root factors that appear by operating the @xmath3 creation and annihilation operators onto the many - body states @xmath38 .",
    "then , the central - limit theorem implies that the matrix elements become independent gaussian distributed random variables ; this is precisely the definition of the canonical ensembles of rmt .",
    "consequently , for @xmath3 , all spectral fluctuations correspond exactly to the predictions of rmt .    by construction ,",
    "the number operator @xmath39 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath40 for all values of the rank of the interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian is thus block diagonal in the occupation - number basis @xmath41 defined above . for a given value @xmath0 , the number of independent random variables of the ensemble is @xmath42 , which in general is smaller than the hilbert  space dimension @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath43 , the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath44 are correlated , i.e. , the number of independent matrix elements of the hamiltonian is larger than the number of independent random variables .",
    "moreover , some matrix elements are identically zero .",
    "the evaluation of statistical measures of the spectrum requires unfolding the spectra , which removes the non - universal system - dependent contributions .",
    "this can be done by performing the unfolding individually for each spectrum ( spectral unfolding ) or by a single transformation used for all members of the ensemble ( ensemble unfolding ) . in the context of spectral fluctuations",

    "the dense limit is defined as the limit @xmath45 with @xmath0 and the number of single - particle levels @xmath46 fixed .",
    "this result was obtained analytically by considering the fluctuations of the centroids and variances of individual spectra , which do not vanish in the limit @xmath45 of infinite hilbert - space dimension  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the dense limit , ensemble average and spectral average yield in general different results .",
    "the non - ergodic character of the ensemble in the dense limit is a consequence of the fact that each member of the ensemble is liouville integrable in the classical limit  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "spectral unfolding is the only physically meaningful rectification of the spectra . in the numerical results described below",

    "[ fig1 ] , we present the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath48 for various values of @xmath0 , for @xmath14 and @xmath49 . these results were obtained after averaging over @xmath50 realizations of the ensemble .",

    ", the system corresponds to two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "consequently , after unfolding , we obtain the expected distribution for an equidistant spectrum , i.e. , @xmath51 [ fig .",

    "[ fig1]b , for @xmath52 , this distribution changes considerably .",
    "it displays a quite large peak at @xmath53 , a tail that decays somewhat slower than the gaussian tail for larger values of @xmath54 , and a broad peak around @xmath55 reminiscent of the dirac delta obtained for @xmath2 .",
    "the peak at @xmath53 indicates the occurrence of quasi - degenerate energy levels and , as we shall demonstrate below , it is a consequence of the time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath14 ) of the ensemble .",

    "eventually , around @xmath61 , a new local maximum of the distribution is noticeable around @xmath62 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1]f ] , which moves toward larger values of @xmath54 for larger values of @xmath0 ; this peak will become the single maximum of the goe reached at @xmath3 . from here on , except for the peak at @xmath53 , the distribution evolves toward the goe results by increasing the value of @xmath0 ( see  @xcite ) , similarly to the transition observed in the spectral properties of the system when the dynamics of its classical analog evolves from near integrable to fully chaotic .",
    "interestingly , the peak at @xmath53 is still observed for rather large values of @xmath0 . around @xmath63 [ fig .",
    "[ fig1]g ] this peak disappears , i.e. , level repulsion completely sets in . beyond @xmath64 ,",
    "the distribution corresponds essentially to that of a goe .",
    "we note that there is no value of @xmath0 where @xmath48 fully coincides with the poisson distribution , although it does so for larger spacings ( tail of the distribution ) in an extended range of values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is not clear to us how to explain such an exponential tail for intermediate values of @xmath0 . at the moment , we believe that this fact may be related with a partial applicability of the original berry - tabor argument , which somehow can not be extended to all tori ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some recent results discussing the generic aspects of the berry - tabor conjecture ) .",
    "the remarkable property of the nearest - neighbor distributions described above is the appearance and robustness of the large peak found around @xmath53 .",
    "this peak is not only pointing out the lack of level repulsion , but actually indicating that a relevant part of the spectrum is degenerate or quasi - degenerate .",
    "this peak corresponds to the prediction of shnirelman s theorem  @xcite , which essentially states that smooth - enough time - reversal invariant ( @xmath14 ) and integrable hamiltonian of two degrees of freedom have an asymptotically multiple spectrum , i.e. , quasi - degenerate levels ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "the continuous black curve ( full circles ) represents the average number of shnirelman doublets ( @xmath14 ) obtained using the symmetry properties of the eigenfunctions .",
    "the inset shows details for small values of @xmath0 .",

    "the results are illustrated in  fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for different values of @xmath0 , considering @xmath66 bosons and @xmath50 realizations of the ensemble ( see the corresponding movie  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the figures show the transition from a picket fence spectrum ( @xmath2 ) to a gue ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in particular , they show the absence of the strong peak at @xmath53 ( shnirelman s peak ) , even though as a function of @xmath0 there is certain degree of level clustering , which are not quasi - degeneracies of the type discussed above .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] implies that , as a function of @xmath0 , there are different statistical properties of the degenerate levels .",

    "as shown above , for @xmath14 shnirelman doublets appear and correspond to the quantization of non - self - retracing periodic orbits , i.e. , orbits which are not mapped onto their selves under time - reversal invariance ( @xmath125 ) . yet ,",
    "these are not the only quasi - degenerate levels found since there are also accidental degeneracies involving two distinct self - retracing tori that just happen to have the same energy .",
    "note that shnirelman doublets disappear for @xmath15 , while the accidental degeneracies persist .",
    "therefore , in order to distinguish the true shnirelman doublets , we must consider the corresponding eigenfunctions , in a representation where the time - reversal invariance is appropriately manifested .",
    "for this purpose , we first analyze the structure of the eigenfunctions of the quasi - degenerate states using a plane - wave decomposition which is straightforward to interpret in semiclassical terms  @xcite .",
    "once we have classified the quasi - degeneracies , we address the question of the statistics of the shnirelman splittings .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is conveniently expressed in the number occupation basis or fock basis . for a given number of bosons @xmath1 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath140 the state having @xmath141 bosons in the first single - particle state and @xmath142 bosons in the second and @xmath143 . upon diagonalization ,",
    "the eigenfunctions of each realization of the ensemble are written as linear combinations of these basis states and have the form @xmath144 .",
    "the idea now is to use a representation where the symmetry properties of the time - reversal invariance are manifested . to this end",
    "we recall that semiclassically the number states can be represented as plane waves on the configuration torus ( defined by the angle variables ) , namely , @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "hence , the eigenstates can be written as @xmath146 |\\phi_1 , \\phi_2\\rangle$ ] .",
    "since the total boson number is conserved , the associated dimensional reduction is implemented with the same canonical transformation described for the classical action - angle variables , which is a point transformation .",
    "then , the eigenfunction of the @xmath147th excited state is written as@xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) , the factor @xmath149 is a common phase factor for all eigenstates , which can therefore be ignored , implying that the wave functions are functions only of the angle @xmath99 .",
    "equation ( [ eq8 ] ) defines the reduced representation of @xmath147th wave function .     showing two pairs of non - self - retracing tori .",
    "the labels indicate the symmetry - related eigenfunctions . the color ( grey ) code is related to the full classical energy - scale of this case .",
    "( b )  reduced representation of the square modulus of the eigenfunction @xmath150 .",
    "( c )  linear combinations  ( [ eq9 ] ) and  ( [ eq10 ] ) with respect to levels @xmath150 and @xmath151 ; the figure shows that the linear combinations lie on opposite sides of the @xmath99 axis and therefore the eigenfunctions are a shnirelman doublet .",
    "( d )  result of the linear combinations when considering two non - symmetry related nearby levels @xmath150 and @xmath152 .",
    ", width=302,height=680 ]    as discussed above , shnirelman doublets are related to non - self - retracing tori ( under the transformation @xmath153 ) that sustain a state .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath154 and @xmath155 appear as mixtures of wave functions localized around each symmetry - related torus .",
    "therefore , we consider the linear combinations @xmath156    in order to identify shnirelman doublets we proceed as follows : first , we identify energy levels which lie very close together , which in practical terms means within the first few bins of the nearest - neighbor distribution measured in units of the mean - level spacing .",
    "one would naively think that shnirelman doublets appear as consecutive levels ; yet , accidental degeneracies due to other tori may have energies in between those of the doublets .",
    "this happens rather frequently for @xmath157 , where the number of stable fixed points grows quadratically on @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we must check not only degeneracy with respect to the nearest level , but within a wider range . then , for each candidate @xmath147 of a shnirelman doublet , we consider a second level @xmath158 and construct the linear combinations given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) and  ( [ eq10 ] ) . if and",
    "only if the functions @xmath159 and @xmath160 are concentrated on one side of the @xmath99 axis ( either positive or negative ) , and among them they are in opposite sides , then we say that the levels correspond to a shnirelman doublet . in this case , the functions @xmath159 and @xmath160 are said to be related by the time - reversal transformation @xmath125 .    this method is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , we plot the classical phase - space representation of the non - self - retracing tori corresponding to two pairs of shnirelman doublets belonging to the same ladder . figures  [ fig6](b)-[fig6](d ) display the reduced representation of the modulus square of some linear combinations involving these states .",
    "figure  [ fig6](b ) displays one of the states corresponding to the tori @xmath150 . in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) , we present the linear combinations ( [ eq9 ] ) and  ( [ eq10 ] ) involving the states @xmath150 and @xmath151 ; the resulting states are localized on either side of the @xmath123 line , from where it is clear that these states are related by time reversal invariance . finally , in fig .  [ fig4](d )",
    ", we display the linear combinations involving two states @xmath150 and @xmath152 which belong to the same ladder but are not related by time - reversal invariance .",
    "we are interested in the spectral statistics of the spacings of the energies @xmath161 and @xmath162 of shnirelman doublets , i.e. , the shnirelman splittings , each one defines a characteristic tunneling time given by @xmath163 .",
    "let @xmath161 and @xmath162 be the energies of a shnirelman doublet of a specific realization obtained by diagonalization .",
    "we define @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the mean value of @xmath166 taken over the corresponding realization .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath167 is a measure of the splitting @xmath161 and @xmath162 in units of the energy of the doublet , averaged over the splittings of the corresponding realization of the ensemble . the average is performed in order to compare the splittings of different realizations of the ensemble ; hence , @xmath168 .",
    "then , @xmath167 is a kind of unfolded spacings of the shnirelman doublets .    in  fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we present the distribution of the spacings of shnirelman doublets @xmath169 for various values of @xmath0 . these results were obtained for @xmath49 and @xmath50 realizations of the ensemble . for @xmath52 ,",
    "this distribution displays a large narrow peak close to @xmath170 which is not symmetric .",
    "the peak decays very fast , acquiring a somewhat constant tail toward larger values of @xmath167 ; this tail vanishes after @xmath171 .",
    "that is , while most doublets have a very small spacing in the normalized units used here , the doublets close to the edge of the ladder have larger spacings . for @xmath172 ,",
    "similar results hold ; yet , it is worth noticing that the distribution becomes somewhat wider with respect to the result for @xmath52 . as @xmath0 increases further ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath169 becomes more complex , with a gradual appearance of a second peak [ close to @xmath173 in fig .",
    "[ fig7]c ] . for a larger value of @xmath0 around @xmath174",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig7]d ] , both peaks have a similar amplitude ; beyond this value of @xmath0 , the left peak diminishes smoothly , eventually vanishing , yielding again a single peak distribution , this time for values centered around @xmath175 .",
    "the transition in @xmath169 described above can be understood as follows .",
    "for small values or moderate values of @xmath0 , the unimodal distribution reflects the existence of one or more ladders of shnirelman doublets .",
    "each ladder has a number of doublets , the spacing with in each doublet becoming larger ( smaller tunneling times ) as we climb up the ladder . imposing @xmath168 yields the long tail observed in the distribution . by increasing the value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath169 becomes bimodal , displaying a second peak centered around @xmath176 .",
    "that is , the doublets have either a very small splitting or splittings of order @xmath177 .",
    "as mentioned above , larger splittings are attributed to the last doublets of a ladder around a stable fixed point . in order to have a significant number of them without increasing the number of small splittings ,",
    "we conclude that their ladder must consist of very few ( one or two ) shnirelman doublets .",
    "this idea is consistent with the fact that , for large value of @xmath0 , only a single doublet is observed around the stable fixed points where the quantization condition eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) holds .",
    "note that the latter case implies again a unimodal distribution @xmath169 , this time the peak being centered around @xmath177 , as it is observed numerically .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the @xmath0-body embedded ensembles for bosons distributed in two levels for @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for @xmath14 , we found a large peak at @xmath53 in a large interval of @xmath0 which indicates the presence of degeneracies .",
    "this peak is quite robust in terms of @xmath0 , disappearing only when @xmath0 is very close to @xmath1 , the total number of bosons . for @xmath15 ,",
    "the peak is absent , despite of the fact that there are accidental quasi - degeneracies which yield small spacings ; hence , the large peak is a consequence of the time - reversal invariance of the ensemble .",
    "we showed that this peak is associated with shnirelman doublets , which semiclassically correspond to the quantization of tori that are non - self - retracing under time - reversal .",
    "these results provide further evidence on the integrability of the ensemble  @xcite based now on the spectral properties of the ensemble and therefore explain the non - ergodic properties of the ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the fact that shnirelman doublets are not observed for @xmath0 very close to @xmath1 , where goe spectral statistics hold , is due to the fact that the non - self - retracing tori which would yield such doublets have a extremely small action , as shown in the phase - space representation of this case .",
    "we also found for @xmath14 that the number of shnirelman quasi - degeneracies displays a dependence upon @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the statistics of the normalized splittings do display also a dependence on @xmath0 ; in particular , for @xmath52 and @xmath172 which are the physically relevant cases , we observe certain qualitative differences .",
    "we believe that these results may be interesting for understanding and modeling three - body interactions in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "indeed , the existence of shnirelman doublets opens the possibility of producing or observing other type of josephson - like oscillations in two - mode bose - einstein condensates which may not be centered around zero population imbalance [ see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) ] . to clarify this",
    ", we must emphasize that the degenerate states present in two - mode bose - einstein condensates  @xcite are not shnirelman doublets ; the degeneracies are due to the fact that the potential wells are indistinguishable , i.e. , they are associated with the quantization of two tori related by the symmetry @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , in order to produce shnirelman doublets , we must have the possibility of tuning _ all _ two - body interaction matrix elements at will , which may require considering also two species condensates .",
    "once this is done , the statistical properties of shnirelman doublets could be used to characterize the role of interactions beyond @xmath52 .",
