    "in a recent paper @xcite we showed that the 60 real rays in four dimensions derived from the vertices of a 600-cell yield over hundred million critical parity proofs of the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we point out that the 60 complex rays in four dimensions connected with a pair of qubits lead to a similarly large number of parity proofs . both these 60-ray systems can be regarded as generalizations , in different ways , of the set of 24 real rays in four dimensions used by peres @xcite and others @xcite to give proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "+ the real and complex systems of 60 rays have 12 rays in common , but do not share a single parity proof . the proofs in both systems",
    "are interesting for several reasons : they are very transparent and take no more than simple counting to verify ; they are extremely numerous , numbering over a 100 million in each case ; and they possess many geometrical features of interest @xcite .",
    "in addition to these purely mathematical reasons , they are of physical interest because they can be converted into experimentally testable bell inequalities , as pointed out in @xcite , and also tie in with discussions of contextuality @xcite and nonlocality @xcite in four - state systems .",
    "four - state systems provide an attractive setting for a discussion of these ideas because they can be realized experimentally using ions @xcite , neutrons @xcite , photons @xcite and nuclear spins @xcite",
    ". the present parity proofs could also find application in protocols such as quantum key distribution @xcite , random number generation @xcite and parity oblivious transfer @xcite . + the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "[ sec:60 - 105 ] introduces the 60 rays and 105 bases connected with a system of two - qubits and points out their important properties .",
    "it also explains what a  parity proof \" is ( as well as the notion of a _",
    "critical _ parity proof ) and introduces the two alternative symbols we use for such proofs .",
    "[ sec:40 - 40 ] introduces a 40 - 40 subsystem ( i.e. , one consisting of 40 rays and 40 bases ) of the 60 - 105 system and explores its parity proofs . the proofs",
    "are of just six different sizes ( although each consists of a number of geometrically distinct varieties ) , but their replicas under symmetry run into the thousands .",
    "we point out that a projective configuration originating in the work of desargues holds the key to a geometrical construction of all the proofs of the smallest size .",
    "[ sec:36 - 36 ] introduces a 36 - 36 subsystem whose parity proofs are more varied than those of the 40 - 40 system , but which can also be completely delineated .",
    "[ sec : full ] discusses a variety of other interesting parity proofs in the 60 - 105 system .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "a system of two qubits has 15 nontrivial observables , which can be taken to be the pauli operators of the qubits and their direct products .",
    "these 15 observables form 15 triads of commuting observables that are shown in the first column of table [ 60states ] .",
    "the simultaneous eigenstates of these triads give rise to the 60 rays ( as we will term the eigenstates ) shown in the second column of table [ 60states ] .",
    "these 60 rays form the 105 bases shown in table [ tab : bases ] , with the top 15 already being present in table [ 60states ] .",
    "this 60 - 105 system provides the grand framework within which all the parity proofs of this paper are embedded .",
    "table [ tab : bases ] has the following important properties : +   + ( 1 ) it contains two different types of bases : 15  pure \" bases that arise as eigenstates of the triads in table [ 60states ] ( and shown in the top part of the table ) , and 90  hybrid \" bases that arise through a mating ( or hybridization ) of a pair of pure bases . for example , the hybrid bases 1 2 15 16 and 3 4 13 14 arise through a mating of the pure bases 1 2 3 4 and 13 14 15 16 and consist of equal ( and complementary ) mixes of rays from the two of them .",
    "+   + ( 2 ) each ray occurs in exactly seven bases .",
    "in addition to the brief symbol 60 - 105 we have introduced for this system , we will sometimes use the expanded symbol @xmath1-@xmath2 to indicate that each of the rays occurs in 7 bases ( the subscript 4 simply indicates that each of the bases consists of four rays , a fact which is true of all the configurations to be discussed in this paper ) . note the check @xmath3 on the numbers entering the expanded symbol .",
    "+   + ( 3 ) each ray is orthogonal to 15 others and occurs three times with three of them and once each with the twelve others in the seven bases it occurs in . the fact that all the orthogonalities between the rays are represented in their basis table is sometimes conveyed by saying that the system is * saturated*. for a saturated system , such as the present one , the basis table is completely equivalent to the kochen - specker diagram of the rays .",
    "+   + ( 4 ) the 60 - 105 system contains ( in ten different ways ) the 24 - 24 system of rays and bases used by peres and others to give proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "however it also contains an ( astronomically ! ) large number of new proofs that can not be reduced to those of the peres system simply by shedding rays or bases .",
    "it is these new proofs that are the subject of this paper .",
    "+   + ( 5 ) the symmetry group of the 60 - 105 system ( i.e. the group of unitary transformations that keeps its rays and bases invariant as a whole ) has 11,520 elements in it .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "each symmetry operation maps a particular pure basis , say 1 2 3 4 , into any of the pure bases , including itself , and so is described by an operator of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 is the basis into which the mapping occurs",
    ". however all 24 permutations of the final basis states are allowed and the phase factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 can each take on the values @xmath11 subject to the restriction that only an even number of @xmath12 occur .",
    "the order of the symmetry group is therefore @xmath13 +    .the 15 triads of commuting observables for a pair of qubits and their simultaneous eigenstates .",
    "@xmath14 are the pauli operators of the two qubits .",
    "the eigenstates , or rays , are numbered from 1 to 60 .",
    "the components of the ( unnormalized ) rays are given in an orthonormal basis , with commas omitted between components and a bar over a number indicating its negative .",
    "the eigenvalue signatures of the eigenstates with respect to the first two observables in the defining triad are shown at the top ( the signature for the third observable is always such as to make the product of the three signatures a + ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have shown that the 60 - 105 system of rays and bases connected with a pair of qubits has a cornucopia of parity proofs of the ks theorem in it .",
    "the proofs involve anywhere from 9 to 41 bases ( with all odd numbers in this range being possible ) , with several different numbers of rays generally being possible for each basis size .",
    "each proof can be characterized most precisely through its expanded symbol , which specifies not just the number of rays and bases involved in the proof but the multiplicities of the rays as well .",
    "however we have found that even the expanded symbol sometimes fails to characterize a proof completely because different proofs with the same symbol could be unitarily inequivalent . the number of unitarily inequivalent parity proofs runs into the tens of thousands , and we have not attempted a systematic count .",
    "each distinct type of proof typically has many replicas ( sometimes thousands ) under the symmetries of the system .",
    "all these effects conspire to make the total number of distinct parity proofs contained in the 60 - 105 system an astronomically large number .",
    "we find this number hard to estimate but would guess that it is somewhere in the vicinity of a thousand million .",
    "we have exhibited only a handful of proofs in this paper , but hope to make a much wider sample available on a website we plan to set up . + it is a matter of some astonishment to us that a set of 105 bases , which can be fitted easily into a page , should contain something like @xmath0 parity proofs in it .",
    "this ratio of parity proofs to bases is the largest in any system we are aware of .",
    "we recently investigated a 60 - 75 system derived from the 600-cell @xcite and found about 100 million parity proofs in it .",
    "that seems like the closest competitor to the present system , but we believe the present one wins out .",
    "what makes both these systems attractive is the combination of the large number of parity proofs in them together with the fact that every one of the proofs is so transparent .",
    "it is worth pointing out that both these 60-ray systems contain many basis - critical ks sets that are not parity proofs .",
    "these proofs are not as transparent as parity proofs , but they are just as conclusive .",
    "a distinguishing feature of these proofs is that they can involve an even number of bases , whereas parity proofs necessarily involve an odd number . in a recent paper @xcite we estimated the total number of critical ks sets of all types ( both parity proofs and others ) in the 60 - 75 system to be on the order of @xmath15 .",
    "we think the total number of sets in the present system is just as large , but that still remains to be confirmed .",
    "+ we pointed out at the beginning that the 15 observables connected with a pair of qubits also form 15 triads of commuting observables .",
    "this symmetry is further enhanced by the fact that each observable occurs in three triads and each triad involves three observables . in other words , the observables and the triads",
    "form a @xmath16 configuration , i.e. , two sets of 15 objects with the property that each object of either set is associated with three objects of the other .",
    "geometers have identified a variety of examples of @xmath16 configurations .",
    "one of the simplest is known as a _ hexastigm _ because it is based on the numbers 1 to 6 .",
    "let a _ duad _",
    "be an unordered pair of numbers from this set and a _ syntheme _ a set of three duads that include all six numbers between them .",
    "there are 15 duads and 15 synthemes and each is incident with three members of the opposite kind .",
    "coxeter @xcite arranges the synthemes in a 6 x 6 table symmetrical about its diagonal ( and with no entries along the diagonal ) in such a way that every row and every column contains five synthemes that include all 15 duads among them .",
    "this table can be made to pass into a symmetrical version of our table [ tab : mubs ] ( showing the maximal sets of mubs in a two - qubit system ) if one translates the duads and synthemes into observables and triads of observables in a fairly obvious fashion .",
    "we have not been able to push this analogy to obtain further insights into the two - qubit system or the ks proofs contained in it , but we nevertheless find it striking enough to be worth mentioning .",
    "+ an alternative approach @xcite to the two - qubit pauli group exploits its connection with the geometry of the generalized quadrangle gq(2,2 ) .",
    "this approach allows many significant properties of the observables , such as the sets of mubs shown in table [ tab : mubs ] , to be derived from purely geometrical considerations .",
    "these ideas can also be generalized , to some extent , to a system of several qudits @xcite .",
    "+ there is one application of table [ tab : mubs ] to quantum tomography , mentioned by one of us in an earlier work @xcite , that is worth recalling . following the seminal work of wootters and others @xcite ,",
    "it is known that the most efficient method of determining the 15 parameters of an arbitrary two - qubit state is by carrying out measurements of five triads of observables that constitute a maximal set of mubs .",
    "the triads that one uses for this purpose can be the ones in any of the rows of table [ tab : mubs ] .",
    "however a superior strategy would be to measure all 15 triads instead of just the five in a particular row .",
    "this would involve three times as much work , but would allow the state reconstruction to be done in six different ways based on the rows of table [ tab : mubs ] , and so lead to a two - to - one return on the investment . + *",
