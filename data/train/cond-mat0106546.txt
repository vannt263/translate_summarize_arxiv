    "vortex motion is the principle mechanism for resistive losses in type ii superconductors .",
    "vortices also provide valuable information about the nature of low lying excitations in the superconducting state . in clean @xmath1-wave bcs superconductors the low - lying excitations in the core are the bound states of caroli , de gennes and matricon @xcite .",
    "these excitations have superconducting as well as normal metallic properties .",
    "for example , these states are the source of circulating supercurrents in the equilibrium vortex core , and they are strongly coupled to the condensate by andreev scattering @xcite . furthermore , the response of the vortex core states to an electromagnetic field is generally very different from that of normal electrons .",
    "however , in the dirty limit , @xmath2 , the the bardeen - stephen model @xcite of a normal - metal spectrum with the local drude conductivity in the core provides a reasonable description of the dissipative dynamics of the vortex core .",
    "the opposite extreme is the `` superclean limit '' , @xmath3 , in which the quantization of the vortex - core bound states must be taken into account . in this limit a single impurity and its interaction with the vortex core states",
    "must be considered .",
    "electromagnetic response is then controlled by selection rules governing transition matrix elements for the quantized core levels and the level structure of the core states in the presence of an impurity @xcite . in the case of d - wave superconductors in the superclean limit ,",
    "_ nodes _ in the spectrum of bound states lead to a finite dissipation from landau damping for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the superclean limit is difficult to achieve even for short coherence length superconductors ; weak disorder broadens the vortex core levels into a quasi - continuum . we investigate the intermediate - clean regime , @xmath5 , where the discrete level structure of the vortex - core states is broadened and the selection rules are broken due to strong overlap between the bound state wave functions .",
    "however , the vortex core states remain well defined on the scale of the superconducting gap , @xmath6 . in this regime",
    "we can take advantage of the power of the quasiclassical theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the energy required to maintain a net charge density of order an elementary charge per particle within a coherence volume ( or coherence area in two dimensions ) is much larger than the condensation energy .",
    "thus , charge accumulation in the vortex core is strongly suppressed . in order to reduce the coulomb energy associated with the charge accumulation an internal electrochemical potential , @xmath7 , develops in response to an external electric field .",
    "this potential produces an internal electric field , @xmath8 , which is the same order of magnitude as the external field . even though the external field may vary on a scale that is large compared to the coherence length , @xmath9 , the internal field develops on the coherence length scale .",
    "the source of the internal field is a charge density that accumulates inhomogeneously over length scales of order the coherence length .",
    "it is necessary to calculate the induced potential self consistently from the spatially varying order parameter , spectral function and distribution function for the electronic states in the vicinity of the vortex core .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate shows that to produce an induced field of the order of the external field , the dynamically induced charge is of order @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the typical energy scale set by the strength of the external field .",
    "this charge density accumulates predominantly in the vortex core region and creates a dipolar field around the vortex core . for a pinned vortex the charge accumulates near the interface separating the metallic inclusion from the superconductor .",
    "disorder plays a central role in the dissipative dynamics of the mixed state of type ii superconductors .",
    "impurities and defects are a source of scattering that limits the mean free path of carriers , thus increasing the resistivity . defects also provide ` pinning sites ' that inhibit vortex motion and suppresses the flux - flow resistivity .",
    "however , for _ a.c .",
    "_ fields even pinned vortices are sources for dissipation .",
    "the magnitude and frequency dependence of this dissipation depends on the electronic structure and dynamics of the core states of the pinned vortex . in the analysis presented below we consider vortices in the presence of pinning centers .",
    "we model a pinning center as a normal metallic inclusion which is coupled to the electronic states of the superconductor through a highly transmitting interface . in this model",
    "the charge dynamics of the electronic states near the interface between the pinning region and superconductor plays an important role in the electromagnetic response of the core .",
    "in the next section we provide a short summary of the nonequilibrium quasiclassical equations , including the transport equations for the quasiparticle distribution and spectral functions , constitutive equations for the order parameter , impurity self - energy and electromagnetic potentials . in section [ sec : electronic_structure ] we present calculations for the the electronic structure of vortices for superconductors with both @xmath1-wave and @xmath12-wave pairing symmetry .",
    "the results are based on self - consistent calculations of the order parameter and impurity self energy . for @xmath1-wave superconductors",
    ", impurity scattering leads to inhomogeneous broadening of the vortex core bound states , as well as bands of impurity states within the gap . in the case of @xmath12-wave pairing the core states",
    "are further broadened by coupling between bound states and the continuum states through impurity scattering .",
    "we also discuss the structure of doubly quantized vortices and vortices bound to mesoscopic size metallic inclusions . in the case of the doubly quantized vortex there are two branches of zero - energy bound states centered at finite impact parameter from the vortex center .",
    "this leads to a unique signature of a doubly quantized vortex : currents in the core circulate opposite to the supercurrents outside the core .",
    "section [ sec : nonequilibrium_response ] summarizes calculations of the vortex core dynamics for @xmath1-wave vortices in the presence of impurity scattering .",
    "we describe the charge dynamics of the vortex core for both pinned and unpinned vortices , and calculate the local a.c .",
    "conductivity that results from the coupled dynamics of the order parameter collective mode and the quasiparticle bound states in the vortex core .",
    "we discuss energy transport by the core states and the absorption features in the conductivity spectrum , which we interpret in terms of absorption within the bound - state band centered at the fermi level and resonant transitions involving the bound and continuum states .",
    "the quasiclassical theory describes equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of superconductors on length scales that are large compared to microscopic scales ( i.e. the lattice constant , fermi wavelength , @xmath13 , thomas - fermi screening length , etc . ) and energies that are small compared to the atomic scales ( e.g. fermi energy , @xmath14 , plasma frequency , conduction band width , etc . ) .",
