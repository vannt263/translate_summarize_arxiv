    "* ) are among the most numerous agn , comparable in space density to the better - known ( and far better - understood ) seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "m87 with its famous synchrotron jet is the fr1 class prototype with other local examples including centaurusa , ngc4696 ( the brightest galaxy in the centaurus cluster ) , and hydraa .",
    "but where seyfert galaxies exhibit luminous accretion disk emission and broad - line - region ( blr ) emission lines , these two emission mechanisms are mostly or entirely absent in fr1s , making their power source more mysterious . adding to this mystery is the presence of fr1 low - power sources in most brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , including the morphologically - distinct `` cd '' galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example , 70% of bcgs in clusters with a `` cool x - ray core '' have fr1 radio sources with @xmath7 w hz@xmath2 @xcite ; ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "i.e. , fr1s are commonly found in clusters and rich groups of galaxies and often , but not exclusively in the bcg @xcite .",
    "these bcgs are the most luminous , most massive galaxies in the universe . given the observed correlation between the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) mass and the bulge mass or bulge velocity dispersion @xcite",
    ", these galaxies should also possess the most massive smbhs . indeed , local fr1 galaxies host some of the most massive smbhs known :",
    "e.g. , m87 ( @xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and two rich cluster bcgs ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; listed in * ? ? ?",
    "however these most massive smbhs power very low - luminosity agn in comparison to many found in lower - mass , lower - luminosity ellipticals and early - type spirals .",
    "apparently these sources either have little fuel available or do not reprocess gravitational energy as effectively into x - rays , relativistic particles , and radio emission as many agn in less - luminous galaxies .",
    "it is possible that these sources do extract enormous amounts of energy from these most - massive black holes but that most of this energy is converted into the kinetic energy of a bulk outflow whose effect is visible as giant cavities in the surrounding x - ray emitting gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , it is possible that for some reason the sub - parsec structures near the smbh prevent these sources from being as luminous as agn in spirals ( i.e. , seyferts and qsos ) and even those in lower luminosity ellipticals ( i.e. , fr2 radio galaxies and quasars ) .",
    "theoretical modeling of fr1s ( sometimes called the agn  radio mode  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rely on a `` radiatively inefficient accretion flow '' ( riaf , or its several variants : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but its parameters are much more poorly quantified than for luminous accretion disk agn .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a06 hereafter ) found a strong correlation between the bondi accretion rate ( the hot gas mass available at or near the bondi radius ) and the observed jet power in fr1s . while a06 use this result to suggest that bondi accretion is a good model for an riaf , they also derive a very high efficiency ( 2% ) for converting the energy of the gas accretion into relativistic jet power , requiring a very efficient accretion flow from the bondi radius ( @xmath11 parsecs ) all the way into the smbh .",
    "detailed models of this process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) infer that such efficient accretion is quite unlikely and that in many circumstances a thin accretion disk and an outflowing wind can be formed as in the `` adios '' ( advection - dominated inflow - outflow solution ) model of @xcite . for example , @xcite argue for the `` adios '' scenario in which the presence of an `` outer accretion disk '' and an outflowing disk wind will reduce the accretion flow by two orders of magnitude .",
    "observationally , deep _",
    "chandra _ imaging of the fr1 prototype m87 derived an accretion rate comparable to the expected bondi rate of 0.1 @xmath12 yr@xmath2 @xcite outside the bondi radius ( @xmath11 pc ) .",
    "however , more recent x - ray imaging spectroscopy work by @xcite finds an accretion flow greatly reduced below the bondi rate inside the bondi radius of m87 .    detailed fitting of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) within @xmath13 30 pc of the nucleus of m87 by @xcite finds an sed dominated by jet emission throughout the electromagnetic spectrum excepting a small contribution from a cool accretion disk longward of @xmath14 m .",
    "this corroborates earlier work by @xcite .",
    "based on the weak , cool disk detected in the ir , @xcite derive a very low accretion rate of @xmath15 yr@xmath2 from the small , cool accretion disk they derive to be present from the sed .",
    "this same broadband sed was also used by @xcite to place similar constraints on the accretion rate and on the presence of an event horizon .",
    "@xcite also derive a similarly low accretion rate from the previous hst imaging data on the h@xmath0  emission line in the ionized gas disk discovered by @xcite .",
    "the absence of significant faraday rotation for the m87 nuclear source at sub - mm wavelengths is also consistent with a very low accretion rate @xcite . clearly these observational and theoretical results cause problems for the simple bondi rate model of a06 , suggesting that a more complex nuclear geometry than a spherically symmetric , hot gaseous atmosphere is necessary in m87 and other similar sources .",

    "observations using the full spatial resolution of hst ( 0025 in the uv ) are capable of resolving line and continuum emission at the level of 2  pc in m87 , 4.5  pc in ngc4696 and 30  pc in hydraa .",
    "well - sampled optical imaging of m87 in h@xmath0  @xcite and imaging spectroscopy in [ ] @xcite and h@xmath0@xcite with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) yield detections of this disk to within @xmath13 6 pc of the smbh .",
    "uv spectroscopy can do a bit better than this so the detection of ly@xmath0  through the 0.\"26 fos aperture by @xcite provides a probe of ionized gas close to the nucleus as well ( @xmath18 pc ) .",
    "the detection of ly@xmath0  emission in m87 and other fr1s verifies the presence of cooler gas in the riaf and its observed line - width and shape can determine some specifics about the accretion ; e.g. , the minimum mass that has `` dropped out '' of a hot accretion flow . also , the mere presence of small amounts of cool gas inside the bondi radius supports models of a much more inefficient riaf than originally suggested @xcite , consistent with the new x - ray analysis of @xcite and the sed analysis of @xcite .",
    "weak emission line wings also are expected in some models @xcite as well as weak , highly - ionized absorption suggestive of an outflowing wind ( an `` adios '' ) .",

    "given the dramatic spatial extent of h@xmath0  emission in some of the nearest fr1s , including m87 @xcite and ngc4696 @xcite , most of the observed narrow emission line gas is not nuclear at all .",
    "however , some few bllac objects have been observed to possess broad h@xmath0  lines , including oj287 @xcite , pks0521@xmath17365 @xcite and even bllac itself @xcite , which is undoubtedly nuclear .",
    "recently , using the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we discovered weak , and relatively narrow ly@xmath0  emission lines in three low-@xmath21 bllac objects ( stocke , danforth & perlman 2011 ; paper  1 hereafter ) .",
    "the cos spectra provide ly@xmath0  emission line luminosities ( @xmath22 ) , line widths ( @xmath23 km  s@xmath2 ) and simultaneous beamed continuum luminosities .",
    "these observed ly@xmath0  line luminosities are orders of magnitude less than those seen in seyfert galaxies and are well below the line luminosities required in an ionization - bounded blr based on the observed non - thermal continuum luminosities in these sources .",
    "but we know that the continuum is beamed in bllacs and an uncertain beaming factor needs to be applied to estimate the luminosity of the unbeamed continuum to determine whether the cool ly@xmath0-emitting gas is ionization - bounded or density - bounded .",
    "if the gas surrounding the smbh in fr1 agn is density - bounded ( the prediction of riaf models ) , the ly@xmath0  line luminosities provide an order - of - magnitude estimate of the amount of cool gas in the blr .",
    "in this paper we use far - uv ( fuv ) spectroscopic observations from hst / cos of three nearby fr1s : m87 , ngc4696 and hydraa and two unpublished bllac objects to investigate the relationship between fr1s and bllac objects and to investigate the ly@xmath0  and continuum luminosities in unbeamed radio galaxies .",
    "ly@xmath0  emission lines consistent with being circum - nuclear in origin are seen in all three fr1s .",
    "therefore , these emission lines and the unbeamed continua underlying them can be used to probe accretion physics . in section  2 we present and describe the cos spectroscopy and data modeling techniques for these three fr1s as well as for two as - yet - unpublished bllac objects from observing time provided to the cos science team . in section  3",
    "we describe our findings and derive basic physical parameters from emission models . in section  4",
    "we discuss the implications of these observations for physical models of the smbh and circum - nuclear regions of these objects .",
    "finally , in section  5 we summarize our main results and discuss their importance for agn physics and cosmology .",
    "three fr1 galaxies ( table  1 ) were observed as part of hst guest observer ( go ) program 13489 ( pi : stocke ) .",
    "each was observed for a nominal two - orbit visit using the cos / g130 m grating .",
    "four exposures at different central wavelengths give continuous spectral coverage over the entire g130 m range ( @xmath24 ) at a resolution of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the two bllac objects in table  1 were observed as part of the cos guaranteed time observations ( gto ) programs ( pi : green ) . like the previous three bllacs for which ly@xmath0  emission was detected by paper  1 , these were observed with both the cos / g130 m and g160 m gratings giving continuous spectral coverage over @xmath27   at a resolution of @xmath25 .",
    "intervening absorption line measurements for these two bllacs were published as part of the @xcite compilation , but agn continuum and emission - line properties are new to this work .",
    "the data were retrieved from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) and reduced via the methods described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , each exposure was binned by three native pixels or @xmath28 of a point - source resolution element to increase the signal - to - noise before coaddition .",
    "the exposures were coaligned in wavelength by cross - correlating strong galactic absorption features in each exposure and interpolated onto a common wavelength vector and then combined using an exposure - time - weighted algorithm . more details of the cos spectral reduction process can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "next , the galactic ly@xmath0  profile was fitted to determine the milky way @xmath29  which was in turn used to remove foreground reddening ( calculated @xmath30 values are given in table  1 ) .",
    "in all three fr1 cases , the foreground reddening is small .",
    "no internal source reddening was assumed for either the fr1s or the bllacs .",
    "all three fr1 galaxies show prominent ly@xmath0  emission at very close to the systemic redshifts .",

    "these fos spectra of the nucleus cover approximately the same wavelength range as the cos / g130 m data including the ly@xmath0  emission in m87 at 1220.8   . in both the two @xcite observations and our own , the intrinsic flux and line shape of ly@xmath0  are difficult to determine due to the presence of the galactic damped ly@xmath0  absorption ( dla ) as well as probable absorption in m87 .",
    "regardless of the corrections which must be made due to the galactic dla and other absorbers in m87 , @xcite find that the ly@xmath0  emission line possesses a @xmath74 km  s@xmath2-wide core and a redshifted tail that extends at least another 800  km  s@xmath2  to the red .",
    "however , the m87 absorption has unknown @xmath29 , which makes it difficult to remove in order to determine the intrinsic ly@xmath0  emission line properties .",

    "the variable absorption velocities reported as well as the partial covering of the source suggested by the  and  absorption , which have 1:1 doublet ratios but low optical depths @xcite , are strong indicators that variable absorption exists in the nucleus of m87 , perhaps due to cloud proper motions .    on what is likely a slightly larger scale , hst / fos off - nuclear optical spectra and hst / faint object camera ( foc ) optical imaging discovered an ionized gas disk with keplerian motion @xcite that connects to non - keplerian blueshifted emission - line filaments primarily to the nw of the nucleus .",
    "@xcite speculate that the observed nuclear absorption lines found by @xcite are kinematically related to this filamentary gas since these are blueshifted with respect to the nucleus as well .",
    "@xcite used the spectroscopic capabilities of the faint object camera ( foc ) on hst to determine the rotation curve of the [ ] emitting gas in the nuclear disk which better determined the mass of the smbh .",
    "relevant to this study , no [ ] forbidden - line emission was found within 007 ( 5 pc ) of the nucleus .",
    "similar long - slit , optical spectra obtained with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) were obtained by @xcite to refine the smbh mass estimate .    due to all these potential complications and uncertainties , we elected to deconvolve the emission and absorption components in ly@xmath0  using an _ a priori _ approach .",
    "the ly@xmath0  profile is characterized by a strong emission peak at @xmath77 km  s@xmath2  with a dereddened peak amplitude of @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "this is @xmath80 times brighter than observed with fos by @xcite on 1997 , 23 january , and nearly @xmath81 brighter than on 1997 , 18 january ( although these new observations are through a larger aperture ; 25 with cos compared to 026 with fos ; see section 3.1.2 ) .",
    "weaker emission can be seen extending over the range @xmath82   and thus blended with the milky way dla .",
    "the emission line profiles in the three cos spectra shown here , especially the ly@xmath0  line in m87 , are far too broad to be affected by any spectral smearing caused by the marginal spatial resolution in the cos aperture ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "we model the ly@xmath0  emission profile as three emission components ( `` blue '' , `` main '' and `` red '' ) , a damped galactic ly@xmath0  absorber at @xmath83 , a weak , broad absorption component to accomodate possible absorption in m87 , and a linear far - uv continuum flux .",
    "the detailed flux model includes fifteen fitting parameters ( three for each gaussian emission component , three for the m87 absorber , two each for the galactic dla and the non - thermal continuum of m87 ) , each allowed to vary around a reasonable range . despite this complexity ,",
    "a remarkably robust fit is determined ( @xmath84 ) even when fit parameters are allowed to vary over a broad range of plausible values .",
    "best - fit quantities and @xmath85 fitting uncertainties are given in table  2 and shown overplotted on the data in the left - hand panels of figure  [ fig : m87lines ] .",
    "blue and red wings are apparent in the emission profile and these are best fit with two additional gaussian components with centroids at @xmath86   and @xmath87  , respectively , modified by the galactic dla . if ly@xmath0  emission , these correspond to @xmath88 km  s@xmath2  and @xmath89 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we note that the blue- and red - wings of the profile * can not * be fitted with a single very broad emission component at @xmath90 km  s@xmath2 ; two gaussian profiles offset from the main , central component by @xmath91 km  s@xmath2  are required .",
    "thus , if the blue and red emission are both ly@xmath0 they are approximately symmetrically - placed around the main ly@xmath0  line .",
    "we interpret the red component as ly@xmath0  emission redshifted by @xmath92 km  s@xmath2  with respect to the main ly@xmath0  emission in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the maximum redshifted velocity observed in this broad component is @xmath93 km  s@xmath2  relative to the main ly@xmath0  line .",
    "the blue side emission is possibly either  1206   emission at @xmath94 km  s@xmath2  or ly@xmath0  emission blueshifted at @xmath95 km  s@xmath2  lsr or @xmath96 km  s@xmath2  with respect to the main ly@xmath0emission peak",
    ". the larger uncertainty in the velocity centroid of this line is due to the presence of the galactic dla , making this component s position and profile very dependent upon the exact assumed dla column density ( see below ) .",
    "the  interpretation is consistent with the velocity and line width of emission seen in  ( see below ) , albeit with significant uncertainty .",
    "however , the velocity centroid of the proposed emission is almost 300 km  s@xmath2  _ greater _ than the strong ly@xmath0emission centroid , casting doubt on this identification .",
    "further , if this emission is , it would be much stronger than what is seen in any other agn . in a typical seyfert like mrk817 @xcite , a  line as luminous as the blue component in m87 would be visible as an asymmetry in the line profile of ly@xmath0 .",
    "this is not observed .",
    "further , the fuv spectum of the prototypical narrow - line seyfert1 galaxy , izw1 has only a reported marginal detection of  emission at a level ten times weaker than the feature we observe in m87 .",
    "we conclude that this feature is unlikely to be .",
    "if this emission is interpreted as ly@xmath0 , it has a velocity of @xmath95 km  s@xmath2  lsr and a blueshifted velocity of @xmath96 km  s@xmath2  relative to the ly@xmath0  emission peak , making it reasonably symmetrical in both velocity offset and luminosity to the redshifted ly@xmath0  emission line which is not affected by the galactic dla and has been reported previously .",
    "a dip near the peak of the main component of the ly@xmath0  emission line is well - fit as a very broad ly@xmath0  absorption line ( @xmath97 km  s@xmath2 ) at @xmath98 km  s@xmath2  ( @xmath99 km  s@xmath2  relative to the main line centroid ) . while similar to the broad , low - ion detections seen by @xcite , this absorption component is at a very different heliocentric velocity ( @xmath100 km  s@xmath2  relative to the @xcite detections ) .",
    "this absorption lies on the red side of the ly@xmath0  peak compared to the blue side absorption seen in the epoch 1997 fos spectrum .",
    "the galactic dla absorption we fit has a derived @xmath101 , quite close to but slightly less than the galactic @xmath102 value inferred by @xcite .",
    "this value is also close to but slightly larger than the total @xmath103 found by @xcite from a continuum fit to the x - ray emission at the m87 nucleus . if we constrain the galactic dla @xmath29  to be between the two sankrit values , our best - fit solution is driven to the minimum value ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) and the intrinsic main ly@xmath0  emission component would increase by a factor of 8% in flux . however , the blue emission is much more affected by the galactic dla increasing ; its line - flux increases by nearly a factor of two and its emission centroid shifts to @xmath105  . at nearly 1.5   redward of its location in the unconstrained model ( table  2 , figure  [ fig : m87lines ] ) , it is even more unlikely to be  1206  and much more likely to be a blue - shifted ly@xmath0velocity component at @xmath106 km  s@xmath2  or @xmath107 km  s@xmath2  with respect to the main ly@xmath0  emission",

    "@xcite reported on two epochs of nuclear fos observations in january 1997 separated by five days in which the uv continuum remained approximately constant while the ly@xmath0  emission line flux increased by a factor of @xmath130 .",
    "however , these authors caution that this apparent variability may be due to a slight displacement of the fos aperture .",
    "earlier fos spectra from late 1993 into 1995 reported on by @xcite found that the nuv @xmath16 optical continuum ( 2000 - 4000 ) was variable by a factor of @xmath131 in 2.5 months , showed smaller variability on a timescale of weeks but no change over a one day period .",

    "if the spatial extent of ly@xmath0  is similar , then most of the luminosity of ly@xmath0  is coming from a region not too much larger than the fos aperture .",
    "while proof of ly@xmath0  variability awaits future cos spectroscopy for accurate flux comparisons through the same aperture , an order of magnitude increase seems quite extreme , suggesting that at least some of the fos - cos flux difference is intrinsic variability .",
    "if the line variability over long time intervals ( months to years ) is modest ( @xmath18% ) , similar to the observed continuum variability , the ly@xmath0  line flux could be responding to earlier continuum variations ( a.k.a .",
    "`` reverberation '' ) .",
    "however , the red wing seen in the @xcite fos spectrum and in figure  1 is the most variable portion of the emission profile and is unaffected both by the galactic dla and the reported locations of the absorption in m87 .",
    "therefore , this emission component must possess significant intrinsic variability .",
    "the potential variability of the blue wing emission is not yet known until we obtain new epochs of cos fuv spectroscopy . the only constant emission or absorption component in the vicinity of the m87 ly@xmath0  emission line is the foreground galactic absorption .",
    "if the ly@xmath0  line variability observed in two fos epochs is intrinsic , a very small upper limit on the size of the ly@xmath0  emitting region can be set by @xmath133  cm ( @xmath5 schwarzschild radii for a @xmath134 smbh ; * ? ? ?",
    "but this interpretation is inconsistent both with the rather narrow line width of ly@xmath0  and with the observed spatial distribution of the emission ( see section 3.4 ) .",
    "this is simply closer to the smbh than can be accommodated by the emission line widths .",
    "a model in which the ly@xmath0line flux changes due to a change in the amount of cloud mass in the ly@xmath0  emitting region ( i.e. , variable accretion in a density - bounded region , as was suggested in paper  1 ) is also ruled out since any variability would occur on a timescale over which clouds move in and out of the emitting region at @xmath135 km  s@xmath2 .",

    "a small opf ( @xmath250 ) is also seen in the prototypical seyfert  1 galaxy mrk817 so that the opf values slightly greater than one in table  [ tab : opf ] likely are consistent with photo - ionization with modest covering factor for the emission - line clouds ( see paper  1 ) .",
    "if the ionizing continuum producing the ly@xmath0  in these fr1s is the result of beaming , then the ionizing continuum seen by potential ly@xmath0emitting clouds should vary smoothly with angle away from the beaming axis .",
    "if ly@xmath0  emitting clouds exist isotropically around the continuum source , then some clouds are illuminated by a much larger ionizing continuum than we observe .",

    "a more likely location for the ly@xmath0  clouds is @xmath258 ( @xmath259  cm ; @xmath250  pc ) , the inner reaches of the narrow - line region and of the observed gaseous disk .",
    "so , there is little chance that the fos - observed variability could be due to a very small source size",

    "it seems most likely that the reported 5 day ly@xmath0  variability is spurious , due to a mis - placement of the fos aperture as suggested by @xcite .",
    "currently there is no unambiguous indication for emission - line gas closer than 3  pc , at much larger radii than where the blr of seyferts exists .",
    "the suppression of blr emission in bllacs was first explored by @xcite who pointed out that the steep spectrum ionizing continua seen in bllacs will inhibit the creation of cool , @xmath260  k clouds that are typical of seyferts and qsos . for this mechanism to be operable in fr1s",
    ", this steep ionizing continuum should be illuminating much of the potential blr of these agn .",

    "therefore , the presence of broad - line emitting gas is * not * expected in this class of agn , as we observe .    unlike the narrow core emission in m87 ,",
    "the red and blue wings to the ly@xmath0  emission are much broader and appear to be offset spatially from the main ly@xmath0  emission along the jet axis ( see sec  3.4 ) .",
    "the red wing emission also varies over the same observing epochs and is very likely intrinsic variability since there is no observed absorption in m87 at these wavelengths .",
    "given their oppositely - trending spatial extents , the red and blue emission wings are likely to arise in gas illuminated or shocked by the jet ( blue wing ) and counter - jet ( red wing ) .",
    "spatially - resolved stis spectra can confirm this suggestion .",
    "in the three fr1s observed by hst / cos , the ly@xmath0  luminosities are comparable to or somewhat less than what is expected in `` case b '' recombination theory assuming unity covering factor . in m87",
    "previous epochs saw lower ly@xmath0  luminosities while the continuum luminosities remained the same .",
    "therefore , at the highest ly@xmath0luminosities observed , an ionization - bounded scenario is possible in these agn but , even then , the amount of gas must be close to the amount needed to absorb all the available ionizing photons given the opf @xmath261 values found here . if the line - emitting clouds are in a density - bounded regime then , as illustrated in paper  1 using the ly@xmath0line luminosities seen in bllac objects , there is very little warm gas in this region , @xmath262 .",
    "this amount is inferred by assuming that there is one hydrogen atom for every ly@xmath0  photon emitted .",
    "a reasonable energy conversion rate of this mass ( e.g. , @xmath131% ) finds a very low estimated accretion rate , which is consistent with earlier estimates using a variety of methods @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the observed ly@xmath0  gas is _ outflowing _ rather than infalling , which decreases the estimated accretion rate even further .",
    "this possibility is consistent with the limited red / blue wing spatial information from the cos aperture ( section 3.4 ) .",
    "it is important to verify this assertion using the full hst spatial resolution with stis .",
    "there could be a significant amount of much hotter , `` coronal '' gas in the line - emitting region surrounding the cooler , ly@xmath0-emitting clouds . using the results from @xcite on the detection of [ ] , which we confirm here , an estimate of particle density of @xmath263",

    "if the ionizing continuum radiation extrapolated from the hst / cos spectra of m87 and ngc4696 is typical of fr1 radio galaxies , then the contribution of this class of agn to the extragalactic uv background ( uvb ) in the local universe may be substantial since this agn class is so numerous ( @xmath133% of all bright cluster ellipticals have @xmath267 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the beaming geometry in fr1s also must be taken into account in estimating the amount of uvb contributed by these objects .",
    "for example , there is some evidence from bllac population studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) that the amount of doppler boosting ( i.e , the relativistic @xmath268 ) varies with frequency of emitted radiation .",

    "x - ray - selected bllacs ( most of which are now termed high - energy peaked bllacs or hbls ) often lack the optical non - thermal bllac spectrum , instead showing either a pure stellar spectrum or a mixture of an old stellar population and a non - thermal continuum .",
    "this property and their large space density means that the x - ray beam must be much broader than the optical and radio emitting beams , presumably coming from particles lower in @xmath268 .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the optical polarization studies conducted by @xcite which showed that hbls possess only modestly variable polarization amounts and relatively constant position angles of polarization as if we are viewing hbl optical beams from well off their axes .",

    "due to this somewhat rudimentary understanding of the beaming geometry , here we adopt a simplistic model with a beamed ionizing flux emanating from two cones with half - angles of 20  and an unbeamed flux given by our fr1 observations emitted over the rest of the sphere .    since the extrapolated lyman continuum flux of hydraa",
    "it is almost two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of m87 , we assume that some significant beaming is present in our direction towards this source and we do not use its ionizing flux as typical of unbeamed fr1s . using just m87 and ngc4696 as typical for the unbeamed fr1 population ,",

    "extrapolation of these results to lower radio and x - ray power levels is consistent with all bright cluster ellipticals being radio sources at @xmath275 and x - ray sources at @xmath276 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "indeed , a deep _ chandra _ observation of the central region of the perseus cluster @xcite has detected weak ( @xmath277 ergs s@xmath2 ) non - thermal x - ray point sources from _ all thirteen _ early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath278 in this region . in the @xcite x - ray imaging ,",
    "there is no obvious trend in x - ray luminosity with optical luminosity , suggesting that the agn emission in these x - ray point sources is similar in luminosity for all bright cluster ellipticals .",
    "together , all these studies suggest that virtually all bright early - type cluster galaxies are weak fr1s and could be emitting lyman continuum radiation at levels similar to m87 . despite consistent results from the several studies cited above , this important assumption must be confirmed in order to validate our conclusions concerning the fr1 contribution to the uvb .",
    "the cfa galaxy luminosity function of elliptical galaxies from @xcite finds that the number density of @xmath279 ellipticals is @xmath280 mpc@xmath4 ( we ignore s0 galaxies in this estimate since they appear not to harbor fr1s in general ) . following the @xcite result as well as the extrapolations from higher power levels made in the other studies quoted above",
    ", we assume that all bright ellipticals emit lyman continuum radiation at a level similar to m87 and ngc4696 . from this assumption",
    "we derive an estimate of the unbeamed uv emission from fr1s of @xmath281 ergs s@xmath2 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "this amount is @xmath282% of the total ionizing background at @xmath283 ( assuming the total uv background at @xmath284 from * ? ? ?",
    "if the uv luminosity of @xmath285 ergs s@xmath2 is the unbeamed continuum then beaming of these sources can add significantly to this total , perhaps as much as an additional 7% at @xmath283 if the standard beaming model of @xcite is assumed ( half opening angle of @xmath286 ; see above ) .",
    "this standard model assumption is equivalent to assuming that 1% of all fr1s are seen as beamed sources at any one location and that their mean observed doppler boosting factor is 20 in the uv .",
    "there are a very few ( roughly one in @xmath287 ) fr1s whose beamed non - thermal luminosities are at the luminosities of @xmath288 ergs s@xmath2 @xcite typical of hbl type bllac objects , but these contribute negligibly to the uvb total .",
    "overall the fr1 agn class could contribute an amount to the ionizing background of up to 1/7th ( 10 - 15% of the total uvb ) of the amount contributed by qsos and seyferts locally . if the above assumptions about beaming and the fr1 source population are correct , luminous ellipticals contribute non - negligibly to the amount of ionizing background inferred from source population studies at low-@xmath21 @xcite . a sizeable contribution from fr1s could account for the discrepancy between the most recent uv background model of @xcite ( which has minimal contribution from normal , star forming galaxies ) and the observed absorber statistics in the ly@xmath0  forest @xcite .",
    "however , since most bright ellipticals are found in rich clusters this putative additional uv radiation could be very non - uniform , clumped around regions rich in early - type galaxies",
    ". a more detailed look at fr1 radio galaxy beaming geometries and number density statistics is required at assess these possibilities in more detail .",
    "support for the idea that a large contribution to the uvb could be made by fr1s / bllacs comes from the all - sky survey of far - uv sources made by the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( euve ) .",
    "this continuum survey conducted at a wavelength closer to the lyman limit than any other , detected more bllacs and narrow - line seyferts than any other agn class @xcite .",
    "these two agn classes share an unusual sed with a very steep soft x - ray spectrum as well as the absence of broad permitted lines in their optical and uv spectra .",
    "the three fr1s studied here share the absence of broad emission lines with these more luminous , euv - bright agn classes .",
    "we present far - uv spectroscopic observations of three fr1 radio galaxies ( m87 , ngc4696 , & hydraa ) and two previously - unpublished bllac objects ( 1es1028@xmath16511 and pmnj1103@xmath172329 ) .",
    "all three fr1 galaxies show prominent ly@xmath0emission at very close to the systemic redshifts and a weak fuv continuum .",
    "* m87 * is the brightest and most interesting of the objects observed .",
    "though the cos / g130 m spectral range is relatively short , we measure a power law index of @xmath289 and extrapolate the flux at the lyman limit of @xmath290  @xmath79  at epoch 2014 .",
    "the strong ly@xmath0  emission of m87 is flanked by red and blue wings separated from the main peak by @xmath91  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "weak , , and  emission lines are also seen at the redshift of m87 and we confirm the very weak [ ]  feature published by @xcite at a @xmath291 level .    with the limited spatial information available with hst / cos",
    ", we find that the emitting regions of both line and continuum are intermediate between that of a point - source and a filled cos aperture implying that both extend over regions tens of parsecs wide .",
    "furthermore , the continuum may be slightly more extended than the line emission and the red and blue wings of the ly@xmath0  emission are extended along the jet axis consistent with being due to outflowing material from the nucleus .",
    "the most puzzling feature of the m  87 fuv data is the possible very short ( @xmath141 day ) ly@xmath0  line variability seen in the fos data which is inconsistent both with the spatial extent of the ly@xmath0  emission seen in the cos aperture and the observed , rather narrow line widths of ly@xmath0 . @xcite",
    "raise a concern that a slight displacement of the fos aperture could have falsely created the apparent ly@xmath0  variability . in light of the other evidence",
    ", the short - term ly@xmath0  variability appears to be spurious although this can be confirmed or refuted by future cos and stis fuv spectroscopy ( approved hst cycle 24 program 14277 ) .",
    "it is expected that future long - slit stis spectra also can trace the extents of the three components of ly@xmath0  and the fuv continuum to provide a viable physical picture of the m87 nucleus .",
    "* ngc4696 * shows an asymmetric ly@xmath0  profile and a very weak uv continuum .",
    "we model the emission as a strong central component and weak red wing overlaid on at least one strong  absorption system at the systemic redshift .",
    "we confirm the presence of weak [ ] emission in this object as well .",
    "* hydraa * shows a simple broad - plus - narrow ly@xmath0  emission profile and a moderate fuv continuum .",
    "metal - ion absorption lines in @xmath16  and  show the presence of neutral , metal - enriched gas associated with hydraa , but it is not known if this gas is circumnuclear or associated with the host galaxy on a broader scale .",
    "the ly@xmath0  emission profile is well - fit without intrinsic absorption . despite the appearance of an edge - on dust disk in optical and fuv images of hydraa @xcite , the observations of strong continuum and ly@xmath0  line emission  as well as the lack of narrow  absorption seen in the other two fr1s  leads us to conclude that the dust disk misses the nuclear region itself .",
    "the bllac objects * 1es1028@xmath16511 * and * pmnj1103@xmath172329 * show low - significance ( @xmath292 ) ly@xmath0  emission features consistent with other bllac objects from the literature ( e.g. , paper  1 ; fang et  al .",
    "the ly@xmath0  luminosities of these objects are comparable to that of the fr1s discussed here and in paper  1 . while it is generally accepted that fr1s are the parent population for bllac objects ( and in fact optical and x - ray imaging of bllacs reveal that they reside in giant elliptical galaxies in clusters , as do fr 1s ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission mechanisms , source locations and geometries for the beamed and unbeamed ionizing continua and ly@xmath0  emission lines are still unclear .",
    "as the nearest unobscured fr1 ( centaurus  a is a bit closer but has a nucleus obscured by dust ) , m  87 provides the best opportunity to observe the nuclear structures in `` radio - mode '' agn and solve the puzzle of their apparent very low accretion rates .",
    "new high spatial and spectral resolution observations in the fuv with cos and stis will complement upcoming efforts at x - ray wavelengths and at mm wavelengths with vlbi to determine the size and geometry of the line and continuum - emitting regions in fr1s .",
    "the observed ly@xmath0  luminosity in m87 and ngc4696 is within a factor of a few to what is predicted by `` case b '' recombination illuminated by the non - thermal continuum in these sources extrapolated to the lyman edge .",
    "thus the circumnuclear gas could be either in an ionization- or density - bounded regime .",
    "the ionizing continuum of hydraa overpredicts the observed ly@xmath0  luminosity in this fr1 by a factor of ten suggesting that the observed continuum has some significant contribution from beamed radiation as well as the more isotropic radiation seen in the two other fr1s . the extrapolated fuv continuum flux of bllac objects overpredicts the observed ly@xmath0  line flux by factors of @xmath293 .",
    "these results are consistent with all of these sources possessing an unbeamed non - thermal continuum that is the primary ionizing source for the gas that produces the observed ly@xmath0  emission line .",
    "while both the continuum and ly@xmath0  line are seen to vary , the substantial distance ( 1 - 10 pc ) we have inferred for the ly@xmath0  emitting region does not allow the tight connection between continuum and line variability that is seen for seyfert galaxies (  reverberation mapping  ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , one apparently successful narrow - line - region distance determination has been obtained for ngc5548 using the [ ] 5007  forbidden line @xcite .",
    "a similar study may be possible for m  87 .",
    "fr1 radio galaxies are very common in the modern era , comparable in space density to seyfert galaxies .",
    "recent work at radio and x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) make a plausible case that virtually all bright ellipticals are agn with ionizing luminosities comparable to or greater than what we find in m87 ( @xmath294 ergs s@xmath2 ) .",
    "if it is assumed that all @xmath295 ellipticals possess unbeamed non - thermal continua at this level , the contribution to the low-@xmath21 uvb could be substantial , perhaps as much as @xmath5% of the extragalactic ionizing background .",
