    "dynamical scaling of an equation of motion is a simple but powerful tool for deriving relations between various parameters of that system .",
    "for example , in a classical viscous liquid the navier - stokes equation    @xmath5    is invariant when lengths are scaled by @xmath6 , velocities by @xmath7 , and times by @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this scaling also leaves the reynolds number unchanged @xmath9 which is the famous similarity principle of fluid dynamics .",
    "+ in the following we will summarize what is known about dynamical scaling of the motion of vortex lines in superfluid helium .",
    "in his seminal paper of 1988 schwarz @xcite has scaled his equation of motion of a vortex filament @xmath10 + @xmath11 , \\label{e.vl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the primes denote derivatives with respect to the arc length @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the parameters of mutual friction , and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 1 , @xmath17 is an effective radius of curvature of the filament , and @xmath18 the core radius .",
    "the counterflow velocity , @xmath19 , is simply the difference between normal and superfluid velocities . after introducing reduced time and velocity scales @xmath20 and @xmath21 the resulting equation",
    "was shown to be invariant under the same scaling as discussed above .",
    "even if the above scaling was derived by using a so called local induction approximation ( lia ) the same applies also when using a full biot - savart equation ( bse ) .",
    "the inclusion of the non - local term , which itself satisfies the velocity scaling , only slightly modifies the local term .",
    "since , as will be noted below , the corrections due to the logarithmic term are small and very difficult to observe in experiments , we ignore here the small changes in the logarithmic term that are due to differences between lia and bse .    it should be mentioned that from eq.([e.vl ] ) schwarz calculated a rate equation of the change of the vortex density @xmath22 due to a growth term @xmath23 and a loss term @xmath24 that is scale invariant and that corresponds to the well known vinen equation @xcite , see below .",
    "in ac flow experiments the oscillation frequency @xmath1 is a scaling variable .",
    "this has been recognized some time ago by kotsubo and swift when analyzing their experiments on vortex turbulence generated by high - amplitude second sound in helium-4 @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we apply their scaling results to our experiments on ac flows generated by an oscillating sphere . from the work of schwarz",
    "@xcite they find that the time scale @xmath25 transforms as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "from @xmath30 they obtain by eliminating @xmath31 as a final result    @xmath32    this is how the square - root dependence of @xmath33 is derived",
    ". there is , however , the logarithmic correction by @xmath34 due to the scaling @xmath35 .",
    "we can estimate the logarithmic corrections from the definition of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and using eq.([e.omega ] ) by solving for @xmath38 @xcite @xmath39}{\\ln{(cr^*/a_0)}}.\\ ] ] if we assume that @xmath17 and @xmath40 are approximately given by the intervortex spacing as suggested by schwarz @xcite we estimate as an order of magnitude @xmath41 10 . inserting this we find @xmath42 = 1.04 for our complete frequency range @xmath43 7 .",
    "this is a small correction that could not be resolved in our experiment , see fig.[f : vcsphere ] @xcite .",
    "( from ref.@xcite ) critical velocity for the onset of turbulence as a function of the frequency of 2 oscillating spheres .",
    "blue squares : radius @xmath44 m ; red dots : radius @xmath45 m ; green solid line : @xmath46 ( m / s ) ; temperature is below 1 k. ]    it is true that in our experiments the sphere radius is kept fixed and therefore the square - root dependence of @xmath0 is not an automatic result from scaling .",
    "but as noted by kotsubo and swift , the scaling suggests three possible scenarios @xcite .",
    "one is that @xmath0 depends only on the frequence via eq.([e.vc ] ) , as appears in our experiments .",
    "second option is that it depends only on the geometrical dimension @xmath47 .",
    "this seems to be the case for dc flows as summarized , _",
    "e.g. _ , in refs.@xcite .",
    "the last option is that @xmath0 could depend on both @xmath1 and @xmath47 . in this case",
    "the square - root dependence would show up only in a particular experiment where the frequency and dimensions are both scaled properly .    while the frequency dependence of @xmath0 can be found from scaling no information on the absolute values or",
    "the temperature dependence can be inferred .",
    "as pointed out earlier @xcite the prefactor 2.85 of our experimental result on oscillating spheres @xmath48 ( see fig.[f : vcsphere ] ) may have some geometry dependence because the superfluid velocity field in general varies over the surface of the oscillating body .",
    "hence , this prefactor can only be determined from experiment .",
    "in fact , the vibrating wire data of the osaka group give a slightly smaller value @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 from the second - sound data of kotsubo and swift is about twice of what we find from our spheres at the same frequency and temperature .",
    "another difference concerns the temperature dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "kotsubo and swift find that their @xmath0 decreases with rising temperature from 1.2 k to 2.0 k , while in our case we observe a 10% increase from 1.0 k to 1.9 k that follows from the vinen equation , see below . possibly , these differences may be due to the very different mechanisms by which the oscillating flows are excited .",
    "in our earlier work @xcite we have presented two different ways of deriving the frequency dependence of @xmath0 . a qualitative but very general argument",
    "was based on the superfluid reynolds number @xmath49 by identifying the oscillation amplitude @xmath50 as the characteristic length scale @xmath51 , which immediately implies the square - root behaviour of @xmath33 .        where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "( equation ( [ e.vinen ] ) does not contain the logarithmic term @xmath36 and is invariant under the same scaling as given in the introduction . ) applying the vinen equation to ac flow we have postulated that the vortex tangle , in order to follow the amplitude @xmath55 of the ac flow field , must have a relaxation time @xmath56 @xcite that is shorter than the period of the velocity field , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "this gives @xmath58 .",
    "below 1 k mutual friction can be neglected , hence @xmath59 . towards higher temperatures",
    "@xmath60 gradually decreases and hence @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is in agreement with our data @xcite .",
    "clearly , both methods have a qualitative character . but to our knowledge , a theory of oscillatory superflow , in particular an extension of the vinen equation to ac flow is not yet available .",
    "in contrast , our present approach is based on dynamical scaling that follows from symmetry properties of the equations of vortex dynamics .",
    "equation ( [ e.vc ] ) is a rigorous result .",
    "the logarithmic terms contain the scaling of the length which in our experiments , however , can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the square - root dependence of @xmath33 is well established ."
