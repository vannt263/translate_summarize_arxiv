    "monte carlo calculation is a very efficient method to simulate complex physical systems .",
    "it is based in the generation of random numbers , and the main applications of this method in physics are statistical and quantum systems . generally , instead of true random numbers , the researchers use pseudo - random numbers , generated by computers .",
    "this has an important advantage over the use of real random numbers : every calculation can be repeated several times , if necessary , and the pseudo - random numbers generated repeatedly , in order to check previous results .",
    "the main problem with those numbers is the periodicity that appears near one billion generated numbers , together with undesirable correlations , linear and no linear , that appear in the sets . here",
    "we present the use of the simplest equation where chaos occurs , the logistic map.[1 ] _ _  _ _ using it , it is possible to generate random numbers in the ( 0,1 ) interval , with a particular distribution , and using the ulam - neumann transformation [ 2 - 5 ] they transform in a set of uniform deviates in that interval .",
    "this paper is dedicated especially to the study of the pseudo - random numbers generated with the logistic map , their periodicity and correlation .",
    "the pseudo - random numbers generated with it are not periodic , allowing us to create sequences as big as necessary to simulate statistical systems . the random generated numbers ,",
    "as described above , allow us a wide field of applications .",
    "the obvious among them is also the simplest magnetic system simulation , the 2d ising ferromagnet . as this system",
    "was exactly solved by onsager , it allows to compare the exact results , the critical exponents and properties with the simulations , so we use it as an example of application .",
    "other , we selected the chaotic cryptography as an exercise , using a simplified ascii symbols set .",
    "we applied the numbers to solve condensed matter systems , as colossal magneto - resistance materials , and the results of those calculations will be published elsewhere .",
    "the study of the logistic map where every successive number is obtained from the first with the formula @xmath1 constitutes a subject by itself , and the fact that changing the value of @xmath2 transforms a very simple result in chaos is impressive to everyone who sees this for the first time . plotting the result for @xmath3 = 2.8 , 3.3 , 3.5 etc . , and",
    "finally arriving to the infinite value for the periodicity , about @xmath43.57 provides information about the evolution of the map .",
    "when @xmath5 the map generates random numbers distributed in the interval [ 0,1 ] as shown in fig .",
    "1 .     interval , within 100 divisions . ]    the particular distribution can be easily transformed to uniform deviates using the ulam - neumann transformation : @xmath6     numbers ]    our numbers were generated as follows : a fortran program with the code to calculate the formulas above was written , and calculated with a seed @xmath7 for @xmath8 we called this number the _ seed _ of the sequence .",
    "we discarded the first 300 numbers in every calculation , to avoid any dependence of it with the initial condition .",
    "the necessary step that follows is to demonstrate that the numbers are non - periodic , at least within the limits that we are going to use , and beyond .",
    "we check the periodicity with a small program in a pc computer , looking for any repeated number as the first step , and we proved the numbers are non - periodic up to 10@xmath9easily , running the program about 36 hours .",
    "as we wanted to check the periodicity beyond this limit , we used several parallel and faster computers to check it to 10@xmath0 numbers .",
    "even limited to rational numbers , as every digital computer is , we did not observe any period in the numbers .",
    "the monte carlo and other applications require sometimes various independent sets of random numbers for their development , as in the study of 2d or 3d ising models .",
    "the question is , if our method allow the generation of independent sequences .",
    "we tried this possibility using different seeds , and we observed that every sequence obtained , as that is independent of the others , checking this result as detailed below .",
    "linear correlation was very easily checked .",
    "even with a small quantity of numbers as 10@xmath10 the correlation factor is less than 10@xmath11 fig 3 shows a graph for a small number of data and two independent sets .",
    "fig 4 shows the non- correlation of the same two sets between them .",
    "non linear correlation was also demonstrated using the hessian matrix.the mean , variance , skewness and kurtosis of the distributions were calculated for several seeds , and the comparison through student tests and other test demonstrated that the distributions are equal from the point of view of the parameters , and different as they are not correlated between them .",
    "all these calculations were extended for a great quantity of numbers , of the order of 10@xmath12 to make conclusive the results .",
    "it is very easy to obtain distributions of pseudo - random numbers which are exponential or normal deviates , beginning with our random deviates and transforming them [ 7 ] .",
    "those distributions own the same properties of non - periodicity as the original one .",
    "points ) . ]        -",
    "the ising model has several advantages as a check up for the pseudo - random generator .",
    "one of them is the possibility to calculate it for one , two and three dimensions using the same desk computer that we were using above .",
    "the second , is that the 2d model was solved exactly , and it is possible to use it to compare simulations with exact results , including critical parameters , and delicate properties of the system .",
    "last , but no least , the model is not a quantum but a classic system when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the spin orientation direction , and so , it allows a statistical rather than quantum calculation . with the field perpendicular to the spin orientation , it becomes maybe the simplest quantum system to be studied .",
    "three models , 1d , 2d and 3d [ 6 ] were calculated , and the meaning of phase transition was understood .",
    "the paradigmatic 2d ising model was calculated for a 150@xmath13150 lattice , using the simplest method , the single spin - flip and the periodic boundary conditions using importance sampling , that is , the metropolis routine[8 ] .",
    "we began studying a 5@xmath14 10@xmath15 and 100@xmath16 lattices , to study the size effect on the calculation , and we found that the 150@xmath17150 almost reproduce the exact results of onsager .",
    "the 5@xmath175 and the 10@xmath1710 lattices were calculated exactly , using classical statistical method , in order to compare with the simulations , and those were simulated using congruential generators , too . when the number of sites in the lattice increase , this last comparison was impossible , for the generators overpass the limits of their periodicity .",
    "the first calculation was done within a limited number of iterations for every temperature , 10@xmath18 iterations , and was afterward repeated with 10@xmath19 iterations , which was enough to obtain the magnetization curve shown in fig . 5 and the fluctuations plotted  in fig .",
    "we used a single routine for all the sets , but obtained different sets just changing the seed slightly ( from .1 to .11 , say ) .",
    "these curves are but an example of what can be done with out sets of numbers , and we do intent to demonstrate graphically the efficiency of them .",
    "all the calculations shown here were made using a pc computer , and fortran  77 code , and for the 2d ising model , the time necessary to complete the calculation was less than a day .",
    "most of the - let call them  serious  calculations could require parallel processors , which make faster the calculation , but it is always possible to do modeling - calculations with a small number of iterations - with the table computer , which makes the tedious preparation of the models efficient and comfortable for the researcher .        as this paper",
    "is intended especially to present and analyze the chaotic sequences generated , we necessarily omit applications on systems as colossal magnetoresistance compounds , where we simulated the properties of them using quantum monte carlo and will be published elsewhere , but we made several other calculations as tests for the numbers . the  hit or miss  method of integration was applied to obtain the number @xmath20 from the integral of a quarter of a circle , and other integration methods were repeated , both using our numbers and common congruential pseudo - random numbers [ 6 ] . in these cases ,",
    "we compared the velocity for the calculations , which is less for the simple congruential , but faster when the congruential programs are more sophisticated , as the routine ran4 in ref . [ 6 ] .",
    "following an idea in ref . [ 1 ] , we developed a simple and efficient chaotic encripter and decripter .",
    "for this purpose , we used a simplyfied version of the ascii set , adding and substracting the numbers generated by the chaotic generator .",
    "the code worked perfectly , and the only information necessary to decript the messages is the seed . in this sense , we found that the sets generated with very small differences in the sets are not correlated , and so , a 5 cipher number could be an excellent seed for this purpose .",
    "many other calculations were developed to check the pseudo - random numbers .",
    "just to mention it , we calculated the ising model using non - periodic and screw periodic boundary condition for the clusters , identifying size effects in the calculations ; we calculated the same model using cluster flipping methods , and calculated other systems , as th heisenberg ferromagnet , using monte carlo methods .",
    "the results of those calculations , whenever they conduce to new results , will be publish elsewhere .        [ ]",
    "we conclude that we could develop computer programs using the chaotic properties of the logistic map , for r = 4 , where the successive results are chaotic , deterministic and non - periodic .",
    "we studied the sets so obtained , comparing them with other sets of pseudo - random numbers obtained classically , and the conclusion is that the chaotic sets accomplish the benefits obtained with the non - chaotic sets , that is , velocity and determinism , and allow to use sets as big as necessary , because of their non - periodicity .",
    "most of the preparation and tests were made in a pc computer , which shows its practicity , even when calculations with large number of simulations require faster computers ."
