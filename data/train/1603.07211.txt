    "neuroimaging research has suggested that neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with altered interactions between distributed neuronal populations and brain regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent neuroimaging studies have used graph theory as a tool to understand the brain connectivity patterns , which denote brain regions as nodes , and connections between them as edges ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such studies have identified connectome - phenotype relationships by leveraging these graph techniques , mainly using network graph descriptive metrics ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the overarching goal of brain connectivity network / circuitry research is to enhance understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and clinically useful predictions concerning disease diagnosis and treatment selection ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , generally it is challenging to detect such differential connectivity networks that simultaneously i ) control false positive rate and obtain sufficient statistical power ; ii ) reflect complex connectome topological properties ; iii ) are spatially localized ( edge -specific ) for explicit clinical interpretation and pathophysiological mechanism discovery ; and iv ) are reliable and reproducible ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a driver of these challenges is the nature of connectome data , containing complex topological structure and high - dimensionality .",
    "most network graph metrics summarize all edges as individual measures and lose localized connectivity information ( edge - specific ) . such measures",
    "may lead to difficult clinical interpretability and may lack specificity and sensitivity ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , the mass univariate analyses may keep localized information but are subject to the trade - off between false positive discovery control and lack of statistical power . direct application of the family - wise error control and false positive discovery rate control methods could successfully prohibit spurious positive findings , yet they may be overly conservative and reduce the statistical power and lead to few or no significant findings . to mitigate such trade - offs , many studies pre - define networks of interest to lower the multiple testing burden .",
    "but , pre - defined networks are limited and may exclude potential true signals . recently , more advanced statistical methods leverage multivariate models to link the edge connection strength and overall topological structure to improve model estimation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the resulting inferences ( regression coefficients ) regarding phenotype - related connectome features by using these methods are edge - specific rather than at the network level , and thus they may not allow to automatically detect differentially expressed subgraphs .    in this paper , we define a differentially expressed brain connectivity network as an object that includes three components : nodes ( brain areas ) , edges ( connections between brain areas ) that are differentially expressed between clinical groups , and topological structures of the graph consisting of these nodes and edges .",
    "the topological structure is automatically detected from the data rather than pre - specified .",
    "differentially expressed edges may be distributed in an organized pattern rather than randomly in the brain .",
    "therefore , we consider the union of differentially expressed edges and their organized topological pattern as a potential brain connectivity subnetork biomarker candidate",
    ". a differentially expressed subnetwork can increase statistical power while effectively controlling multiple testing false positive errors by allowing edges borrow strength with each other within the topological structure .",
    "statistical methods have been developed to test the statistical significance of a subset of edges , for example , network based statistic ( nbs ) and parsimonious differential network detection ( pard ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the pard algorithm seems to be more powerful as it not only recognizes the differentially expressed edges but also the topology structure of these edges by applying the rule of parsimony .",
    "hence , automatic detection of latent topological structure is the key step for potential connectivity network biomarker detection .",
    "the more accurately we can identify the underlying topological structure , the lower false positive and negative error rates can be achieved .",
    "in addition , the detected topological structure can provide assistance to reveal the underlying neurophysiologcial and neuropathological mechanism for brain science research .",
    "for example , the clique structure of a differential network suggests most edges between the nodes of the network are differentially expressed , prompting further examination of the specific brain regions involved and their associated interactions .",
    "the pard algorithm only detects the complete subgraph structure of a differential network , however more complex topological structure may appear .    in this article , we propose a novel statistical strategy to detect an organized graph topology : a k - partite graph . in graph theory ,",
    "a k - partite subgraph is a graph whose nodes could be partitioned into k distinct sets such that the nodes in the same set are not connected but nodes from different sets are connected . for brain connectivity analysis ,",
    "an edge is often a continuous ( rather than binary ) quantity that represents i ) the connection strength for one subject ( e.g. the pearson correlation coefficient ) or ii ) to what extent the connection is differentially expressed among different clinical groups ( e.g. a test statistic ) . in this paper , as we try to identify the differentially expressed subnetworks we use the later case .",
    "specifically , we refer to  k - partite phenomenon \" ( for illustration we let k=2 ) when : i ) there are two sets of nodes and the nodes within the same set are highly connected for all subjects across clinical subpopulations ; ii ) the within set connections are not expressed differentially between clinical groups ; iii ) the between set connections show difference across clinical groups .",
    "if we observe  k - partite phenomenon \" , we may infer that the brain disease alters the long - range interactions between two sets of neural populations ( nodes ) rather than the local interactions .",
    "if we successfully recognize the topological structure of the differential subgraph , we greatly improve the statistical power and effectively control false positive findings simultaneously .",
    "however , in practice the  k - partite phenomenon \" is latent and not directly observable .",
    "therefore , we develop a novel statistical framework to detect the structure and provide statistical inference methods to test the statistical significance of the topological structure .",
    "we consider data from s subjects , potentially representing distinct subgroups ( e.g. based on the presence of a clinical diagnosis ) .",
    "fmri data from each subject undergoes preprocessing and is used to calculate functional connectivity between @xmath0 nodes or brain regions , with whole - brain connectivity for a subject @xmath1 represented by an @xmath2 symmetric matrix @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the overall data set is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the location ( 3d coordinates ) of a node @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is identical for all subjects .",
    "we denote @xmath7 as the connectivity metric between node @xmath5 and node @xmath8 for subject @xmath1 .",
    "for instance the functional connectivity ( fc ) edge could be calculated by using correlation coefficient ( or other metrics such as mutual information coefficients ) between two time courses from two nodes using fmri data .",
    "next , we perform statistical analysis ( e.g. two sample test or regression for a case - control study ) on each edge and record a p - value @xmath9 between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath8",
    ". the direct inference on @xmath10 could be invalid due to the dependence structure between edges and the multiple testing issue . instead of making inference by @xmath9",
    ", we use a weighted matrix * w * with the entry of @xmath5th row and @xmath8th column @xmath11 as our input weighted adjacency matrix .",
    "we utilize @xmath12 as a metric to delineate the informative level ( how differentially expressed between clinical groups ) of an edge .",
    "for instance , * w * is the input matrix for both nbs and pard algorithms , and the outputs of these algorithms are subsets of edges with significance levels @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and c is the number of significant structures ) .",
    "usually , the pard will identify @xmath15 as a clique / block with high proportion of informative edges ( see figure [ fig3:f1 ] and [ fig3:f2 ] for pard clique subgraph detection as an example ) . in brief",
    ", the pard algorithm tries to include as many informative edges as possible in the minimal network ( block ) and tests whether there are network differences between clinical groups via permutation test ( @xcite ) . in this article",
    ", we develop our methods based on a detected network @xmath15 ( with corresponding @xmath16 see figure [ fig3:f3 ] for example ) by nbs or pard , and @xmath16 is considered as the input data of our new * k*-**p**artite * * g**raph * * d**etection ( kpgd ) algorithm .",
    "we let @xmath15 be a k - partite graph .",
    "note that , as illustrated in figure [ fig1:f1 ] , the k - partite pattern of @xmath17 is latent . to observe the k - partite graph explicitly as shown in figure [ fig1:f2 ] , we need to reorder the nodes . in our algorithm , we seek an edge preserving bijective mapping ( node reordering ) function @xmath18 that @xmath19 or @xmath20 . in graph theory , @xmath15 is isomorphic to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 .",
    "the bijective mapping functions @xmath18 permutes the order of nodes ( in columns and rows of the connectivity matrix ) simultaneously . if nodes @xmath5 and @xmath8 are connected , denoted @xmath24 , then after permutation @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig1:f2 ] shows a desirable mapping function @xmath18 because in @xmath20 the bipartite structure is directly apparent .",
    "however , the number of all possible permutations is massive with @xmath26 permutations for a graph with @xmath0 nodes .",
    "for example , when @xmath0=100 there are more than @xmath27 possible permutations .",
    "therefore , it is impractical to exhaust all permutations , and we need an algorithm to seek an appropriate mapping @xmath18 that reveals the k - partite structure .",
    "note that edges in our input matrix @xmath16 are weighted .",
    "the key heuristic of our algorithm is that the target mapping function @xmath18 allocates more informative edges ( small @xmath9 values and more significant connectivity difference between clinical groups ) to off - diagonal blocks and less informative edges along the diagonal blocks .",
    "the diagonal blocks represent independent sets of a k - partite graph , where edges within the same independent set are not connected ( not informative for our case ) .",
    "we define the objective function of the kpgd algorithm as :    @xmath28    where formula [ fm1 ] maximizes the informative edges between the @xmath29 independent sets with a given number @xmath29 , and @xmath30 represents an independent set .",
    "the denominator @xmath31 equals to the number of nodes in @xmath30 and is used to avoid a singleton set .",
    "however , the direct optimization of the objective function [ fm1 ] is nondeterministic polynomial time ( np ) complex ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider an approximate solution via discretized relaxation by using spectral graph theory .",
    "let @xmath32 be a binary group index matrix with @xmath33 rows ( number of nodes in @xmath15 ) and @xmath29 columns .",
    "@xmath34 indicates that a node only belongs to one independent set exclusively .",
    "thus , our k - partite detection algorithm is equivalent to estimate @xmath35 by maximizing the objective function in formula [ fm1 ] , and we can rewrite it as :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38=diag \\ { @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is the laplacian matrix ( that is semi - positive definite ) , and @xmath41 is a vector : the @xmath42th column of @xmath40 .",
    "the optimization is raleigh quotient when @xmath41 is a continuous vector , and bounded by the sum of the largest @xmath42 eigen values of @xmath43 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similar to the discretization relaxation of spectral clustering algorithms , we next perform k - means clustering algorithms on the largest @xmath29 vectors to estimate @xmath44 ( the membership of the independent sets ) . note that the kpgd algorithm performs k - means clustering on the largest , rather than the smallest , @xmath29 vectors of the laplacian matrix because our goal is to allocate all informative edges to off - diagonal blocks .    clearly , the selection of @xmath45 is crucial for k - partite structure detection .",
    "we apply a data - driven and automatic @xmath45 selection by using the ` quantity and quality ' criteria that ensures i ) all informative edges are moved to the off - diagonal ( ` quantity ' ) and the proportion of informative edges in the off - diagonal blocks are high  concentrated connections between independent sets ( ` quality ' ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath46    where is the first term is the ` quantity ' criterion , and the second term is the ` quality ' criterion . *",
    "w * is thresholded according to :    @xmath47 to avoid the accumulation of noise - related false positives .. therefore , we select the optimal @xmath48 by grid searching ( from @xmath49 ) .",
    "we summarize the whole procedure in algorithm [ kpgd ] .    calculate the laplacian matrix @xmath50 ;",
    "compute the first @xmath29 eigenvectors @xmath51 $ ] of @xmath52 , with eigenvalues ranked from the largest ; let @xmath53}$ ] be a @xmath54 matrix containing all @xmath29 eigenvectors ; perform k - means clustering algorithm on @xmath55 with @xmath45 to cluster @xmath33 nodes into @xmath29 independent sets ; calculate the quality and quantity criterion for each @xmath29 .",
    "adopt the clustering results using the @xmath29 of the maximum score of the quality and quantity criterion by formula [ fm3 ] .      in section 2.1 , by applying the kpgd algorithm",
    ", we detect the independent sets @xmath56 from @xmath15 , where the intra - set edges are less informative than inter - set edges . in this section ,",
    "we propose a statistical test to verify the k - partite structure ( i.e. the organized pattern of informative edges ) is genuine and then provide a p - value for statistical inference . since @xmath15 has been detected as a differentially expressed subgraph by using algorithms such as nbs or pard , our goal is to further test whether the informative edges of @xmath15 are distributed in a k - partite structure @xmath57 or just randomly .",
    "therefore , our null and alternative hypotheses are :    @xmath58 : the informative edges are distributed randomly in @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath59 : the informative edges are distributed as a k - partite pattern in @xmath15 .",
    "we apply the ` graph edge permutation ' test to determine the statistical significance of the non - randomness of the k - partite topological structure ( chen et .",
    "al 2016 ) .",
    "the non - parametric permutation test for statistical inferences is appealing here , given the challenges posed for determining appropriate asymptotic distributions of the test statistic based on the complex object @xmath15 and multiple testing issues ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the edge permutation test shuffles the order / location of each edge in @xmath15 .",
    "we first transform the input matrix @xmath16 of @xmath15 into a vector of edges @xmath60 with the length of @xmath61 ( @xmath33 is the number of nodes in @xmath15 ) , that @xmath62 .",
    "the edge permutation can be considered as a mapping function @xmath63 that projects @xmath16 to @xmath64 for the @xmath65th permutation .",
    "but , the mapping is not edge preserving as @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , suppose @xmath15 is a subgraph with a specific non - random topological structure e.g. k - partite , and @xmath67 is likely to be a random graph . here",
    ", we use a test statistic @xmath68 to contrast the differential levels of edges between the independent sets ( off - diagonal blocks ) and within theses sets ( diagonal blocks ) .",
    "since the proportion of informative edges in @xmath15 is high as a selected subgraph , if the informative edges are distributed in an organized pattern , the test statistic of @xmath16 should be greater than those calculated for most of the permutations @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "therefore , we leverage the edge permutation to examine the hypotheses @xmath58 and @xmath59 regarding the topological pattern of @xmath15 , and the detailed algorithm is described in algorithm [ gep ] .",
    "we apply the kpgd algorithm to @xmath16 , and calculate a statistic @xmath68 , where @xmath71 is the number of edges between the independent sets and @xmath72 is the number of edges within the independent sets .",
    "list the all edges in @xmath15 as a vector in the original order , @xmath73 , @xmath33 is the number of nodes and @xmath74 .    shuffle the order of edges in @xmath75 , and obtain an edge reordered graph @xmath76 with a weighted edge matrix @xmath77 ; apply the kpgd algorithm on @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) and obtain @xmath78 independent sets , where @xmath78 is determined by the ` quantity and quality ' criteria ; calculate the test statistic @xmath79 as described in line 2 .",
    "if @xmath80 is greater than the top 5th percentile of @xmath79 , we reject the null hypothesis , and thus @xmath15 has a k - partite topological structure .    in summary , we perform kpgd for pattern recognition ( object oriented statistical estimation ) and gep for pattern significance test ( object oriented statistical inferences ) .",
    "the joint application of the kpgd algorithm and the permutation test provides a pathway to identify a differentially expressed subgraph with a k - partite graph topology .",
    "the differentially expressed brain connectivity network with a k - partite graph topology is more specific because it is a part of @xmath15 ( without diagonal blocks ) .",
    "therefore , the informative edges could borrow power from each other more efficiently within a subgraph where most informative edges concentrate .",
    "if the k - partite graph topology is true , our method will not only effectively increase statistical power to detect the differentially expressed edges with low false positive discovery rate but also provide a topology to describe the topological pattern of these differentially expressed edges .",
    "we conduct simulation studies to evaluate whether the kpgd algorithm can optimally determines the number of independent sets and recognize the independent sets in different settings ( i.e. the k - partite structure ) .",
    "we first generate a @xmath81 @xmath16 matrix with each edge given by @xmath82 .",
    "next , we let the number of independent components ( k ) of the k - partite graph equals to 2 , 4 , and 10 , and we use larger values of @xmath82 for off - diagonal edges . for example , we let the edges within the diagonal blocks to be around @xmath83 , and edges within the off - diagonal blocks to be around @xmath84 .",
    "we set the center difference between diagonal and off - diagonal block edges as a parameter @xmath85 .",
    "we are unaware of alternative algorithms to automatically detect k - partite topological structure based on weighted - edge graph , and thus we do not include the performance of competing methods .",
    "we permute the order of the nodes , and the k - partite structures are not directly observable ( subfigures of the left column , figure 2 ) .",
    "we apply the kpgd algorithm to detect the topological structure and the gep test for statistical inferences . for all settings",
    ", our algorithm successfully identifies the correct numbers of independent sets @xmath42 and reveals the k - partite graph .",
    "we evaluate the performance of our new methods by simulating 100 data sets with different values of both @xmath42 and @xmath85 .",
    "we summarize our results in table 1 , specifically reporting rates of false positive ( fp ) and false negative ( fn ) edges .",
    "we observe that in general the kpgd algorithm performs well , and the gep testing strategy successfully recognizes k - partite structure .",
    "when @xmath42 is smaller , the fp and fn is lower , because the pattern is closer to a complete subgraph ( clique ) when @xmath42 is large .",
    "moreover , our ` quantity and quality ' rule successfully determines the optimal @xmath42 , and we consistently estimate the true @xmath42 correctly for each simulated data set ( more than 99% ) .",
    "the gep algorithm also provides sufficient statistical power to reject the null hypothesis that the subgraph @xmath15 is random .",
    "also , our methods seem to be robust to the choice of @xmath85 , and hence the detected topological pattern could improve the robustness to mild and moderate increase of the noise to signal ratio .",

    "may serve as useful features , e.g. as network biomarkers , in the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders .    from an analytical point of view",
    ", brain connectivity analyses naturally involve with high dimensionality and graph topological properties because the connectivity features are interactions between brain areas .",
    "there has been an emergence of statistical techniques to handle high - dimensional data , for example , several multiple - testing strategies as well as shrinkage techniques including lasso , scad , and elastic network .",
    "many of these methods are motivated by high - throughput omics data where interest focuses on selecting differentially expressed ` nodes ' ( e.g. gene / protein expressions and brain activation ) .",

    "complicating issues include the massive number of edges as well as the interdependence of edges in an organized and complex graph topological structure .",
    "often , the graph topology is highly informative for the population level analysis of ` edge ' type features , and tailored statistical methods are needed .",
    "object oriented statistical analysis seems well - suited for the brain connectivity data sets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , prompting the need for novel algorithms to recognize latent topological structures .",

    "the detected graph topology structure not only improves the statistical power , but also could reveal important underlying disease mechanisms .",
    "for example , the pard algorithm detects a general clique / complete subgraph structure that most edges in small network are differentially expressed among clinical subgroups .",

    "<S> emerging brain network studies suggest that interactions between various distributed neuronal populations may be characterized by an organized complex topological structure . </S>",
    "<S> many brain diseases are associated with altered topological patterns of brain connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a key inquiry of connectivity analysis is to identify network - level differentially expressed connections that have low false positive rates , sufficient statistical power , and high reproducibility . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel statistical approach to fulfill this goal by leveraging the topological structure of differentially expressed functional connections or edges in a graphical representation . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new algorithm to automatically detect the latent topology of a k - partite graph structure , and we also provide statistical inferential techniques to test the detected topology . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate our new methods via extensive numerical studies . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply our new approach to resting state fmri data ( 24 cases and 18 controls ) for parkinson s disease research . </S>",
    "<S> the detected connectivity network biomaker with the k - partite graph topological structure reveals underlying neural features distinguishing parkinson s disease patients from healthy control subjects .    </S>",
