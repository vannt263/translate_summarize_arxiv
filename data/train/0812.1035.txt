    "since the leps collaboration reported the observation of a narrow baryon resonance - like structure in the @xmath10 invariant mass spectrum produced in @xmath11 reactions @xcite , a considerable number of experiments have been carried out to check the existence of the exotic baryon , now called the @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13 is a genuine exotic baryon with the minimum quark configuration of @xmath14 , for which a narrow decay width and a light mass were first predicted by diakonov , petrov , and polyakov using a chiral quark soliton model  @xcite .",
    "although the leps result seemed to be supported by several experiments which reported positive evidence for the existence of the @xmath13 in various reactions @xcite , the experimental situation soon became controversial .",
    "many experiments at the high energy , especially collider experiments , found no positive evidence in the @xmath15 invariant mass distributions with a good mass resolution and high statistics @xcite . a typical upper limit for the inclusive production rate for the @xmath13 is less than 1% of that of the @xmath16(1520 ) .",
    "the production mechanism of the @xmath17 might be very different from those of ordinary baryons if the @xmath12 exists  @xcite .",
    "the clas collaboration searched for the @xmath13 in the @xmath18 reaction in the photon energy range from 1.6 gev to 3.8 gev with an integrated luminosity of 70 pb@xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for the @xmath20 reaction was determined to be 0.7 nb . the non - observation of the @xmath1 might be explained by a weak @xmath21 coupling  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath22 coupling constant is small , the photo - production cross - section of the @xmath13 from a proton could be much smaller than that from a neutron  @xcite .",
    "the experiment which is most relevant to the current study was also carried out by the clas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the search was done by detecting all charged particles in the final state in @xmath23 reactions with one order of magnitude higher statistics than the previous experiment  @xcite .",
    "the neutron momentum was reconstructed by using the missing momentum technique , and the @xmath13 was searched in the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution .",
    "no narrow peak was observed , and the upper limit ( 95 % cl ) for the elementary @xmath24 reaction was obtained to be @xmath25 3nb by using a phenomenological model based on the @xmath16(1520 ) production to estimate the probability that the spectator proton is re - scattered and gains enough energy to be detected by the clas detector .",
    "other dedicated experiments using @xmath26  @xcite , @xmath27  @xcite , and proton  @xcite beams have also shown no evidence for the @xmath13 production .",
    "although the theoretical interpretation of those null results contains some uncertainties due to model dependences in the cross - section calculations , a strong @xmath21 coupling is unlikely if the @xmath13 exists .",
    "a model independent determination of the @xmath13 width is possible by investigating the reverse reaction of the @xmath13 decay : @xmath28 .",
    "the diana collaboration observed evidence of the @xmath13 in the @xmath29 invariant mass distribution from @xmath30 reactions in a bubble chamber .",
    "the @xmath13 width was estimated to be @xmath31 mev / c@xmath32 from the production cross - section  @xcite .",
    "this result is barely consistent with the 90%-cl upper limit of 0.64 mev/@xmath33 from the belle collaboration obtained by analyzing events from secondary kaon interactions in the material of the detector  @xcite .",
    "to summarize the situation , if the @xmath13 exists , 1 ) its production is highly reaction dependent , 2 ) the coupling to @xmath34 must be small , and 3 ) the decay width must be less than 1 mev/@xmath33 .",
    "thus , it is desirable to study reactions which are sensitive to the @xmath35 coupling .",
    "the quasi - free reaction @xmath24 is one of such reactions since a @xmath36 can couple to a @xmath2pair .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of the photo - production of the @xmath13 from a neutron by closely comparing it with the photo - production of the @xmath37 from a proton in a deuteron .",
    "because the leps detector has a symmetric acceptance for positive and negative particles , a similar procedure can be applied to the both analyses .",
    "the validity of corrections and event selection criteria can also be cross - checked .",

    "a photon beam in the energy range from 1.5 gev to 2.4 gev is produced at spring-8 by compton back - scattering of laser photons from 8 gev electrons in the storage ring .",
    "the energy of a scattered photon is measured by tagging the electron which is associated with the compton scattering event by event .",
    "the energy resolution for the tagged photon is 10 mev , and typical beam intensity with a 351-nm ar laser is 10@xmath38 photons / sec .",
