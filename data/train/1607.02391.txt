    "fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) is one of the most prominent gaussian processes in the probabilistic and statistical literature .",
    "popularized by mandelbrot and van ness @xcite in 1968 , it found various applications in modeling stochastic phenomena in physics , biology , telecommunication and finance among many other fields .",
    "fractional brownian motion is characterized by its self - similarity property , the stationarity of its increments and by its ability to match any prescribed constant local regularity .",
    "mathematically speaking , for any @xmath0 , a fbm with hurst index @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath2 , is a zero mean gaussian process with the covariance function given by @xmath3 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\left(t^{2h } + s^{2h } - |t - s|^{2h}\\right).\\ ] ]    various representations of fbm can be found in the existing literature ; we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the hurst parameter @xmath4 determines the path properties of the fbm : ( i ) the process @xmath5 is self - similar with index @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath6 in distribution , ( ii ) @xmath5 has hlder continuous paths of any order strictly smaller than @xmath1 , ( iii ) fractional brownian motion has short memory if an only if @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "moreover , fbm presents long range dependance if @xmath1 belongs to @xmath8 .",
    "the statistical estimation of the hurst parameter @xmath1 in the high frequency setting , i.e. the setting of mesh converging to 0 while the interval length remaining fixed , is often performed by using power variation of @xmath9 . recall that a standard power variation of an auxiliary process @xmath10 on the interval @xmath11 $ ] is defined by @xmath12 } \\left|y_{\\frac{i+1}{n } } - y_{\\frac{i}{n } } \\right|^p.\\ ] ] this type of approach has been investigated in numerous papers ; we refer to e.g. @xcite among many others .",
    "the fact that most of the properties of fbm are governed by the single parameter @xmath1 restricts its application in some situations .",
    "in particular , its hlder exponent remains the same along all its trajectories .",
    "this does not seem to be adapted to describe adequately natural terrains , for instance .",
    "in addition , long range dependence requires @xmath13 , and thus imposes paths smoother than the ones of brownian motion .",
    "multifractional brownian motion ( mbm ) was introduced to overcome these limitations .",
    "several definitions of multifractional brownian motion exist .",
    "the first ones were proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a more general approach was introduced in @xcite while the most recent definition of mbm ( which contains all the previous ones ) has been given in @xcite .",
    "the latter definition is both more flexible and retains the essence of this class of gaussian processes .",
    "recall first that a fractional brownian field on @xmath14 noted @xmath15 is a gaussian field such that , for any @xmath1 , the process @xmath16 is a fbm with hurst parameter @xmath1 .",

    "] , is a multifractional brownian motion with functional parameter @xmath19 .",
    "intuitively speaking , the multifractional brownian motion behaves _ locally _ as fractional brownian motion , but the functional parameter @xmath19 is time - varying .",
    "moreover , it remains linked to local regularity of @xmath32 , but in a less simple way than in the case of the fbm .",
    "more precisely , if we assume that @xmath19 belongs to the set @xmath33,{\\mathbb{r}})$ ] , for some @xmath34 , and is such that @xmath35 } h(t ) \\leq h_{\\max}:=\\max_{t \\in [ 0,1 ] } h(t ) < \\min\\{1 , \\eta\\},\\ ] ] then @xmath36 is the regularity parameter of @xmath32 ( see ( * ? ? ? * corollaries 1,2 and proposition 10 ) ) . in this setting the functional parameter",
    "@xmath19 needs to be estimated locally in order to get a full understanding of the path properties of the multifractional brownian motion @xmath32 .",
    "bardet and surgailis @xcite have proposed to use a local power variation of higher order filters of increments of @xmath32 to estimate the function @xmath19 .",
    "more specifically , they prove the law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the local estimator of @xmath19 ( i ) based on log - regression of the local quadratic variation , ( ii ) based on a ratio of local quadratic variations .    in this paper",
    "we are aiming at the estimation of the parameter @xmath36 , which represents the regularity ( or smoothness ) of the multifractional brownian motion @xmath37 .",
    "for this particular statistical problem the local estimation approach investigated in @xcite appears to be rather inconvenient .",
    "instead our method relies on a ratio statistic , which compares the _ global _ quadratic variation at two different frequencies .",
    "we remark that in general it is impossible to find a global rate @xmath38 such that the normalized power variation @xmath39 converges to a non - trivial limit .",
    "however , ratios of global power variations can very well be useful for statistical inference .",
    "indeed , we will show that under appropriate conditions on the functional parameter @xmath19 , the convergence @xmath40 then a simple log transformation gives a consistent estimator of the global regularity @xmath36 of a mbm .    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the basic distribution properties of the multifractional brownian motion , reviews the estimation methods from @xcite and states the main asymptotic results of the paper .",
    "proofs are given in section 3 .",
    "in @xcite bardet and surgailis deal with a little bit more general processes than multifractional brownian motions . however , in order not to overload the notations we will focus in this paper on the normalized multifractional brownian motion ( i.e. the mbm defined by ) . from now on we will refer to this process as the multifractional brownian motion and denote it by @xmath41 .",
    "we start with the basic properties of the mbm @xmath32 with functional parameter @xmath19 .",
    "its covariance function is given by the expression @xmath42 =     \\frac { c^2_{h_{t , s}}}{2c_{h(t)}c_{h(s ) } }    \\left ( { |t|}^{2h_{t , s } } + { |s|}^{2h_{t , s } }   - { |t - s|}^{2h_{t , s } } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 has been defined in .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath45 is a @xmath46-function .",
    "the local behaviour of the multifractional brownian motion is best understood via the relationship @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the convergence of finite dimensional distributions . hence , in the neighbourhood of any @xmath49 in @xmath24 , the mbm @xmath32 behaves as fbm with hurst parameter @xmath50 .",
    "this observation is essential for the local estimation of the functional parameter @xmath19 . in the following",
    "we will briefly review the statistical methods of local inference investigated in bardet and surgailis @xcite , which is based on high frequency observations @xmath51 . while the original paper is investigating rather general gaussian models",
    "whose tangent process is a fractional brownian motion , we will specialize their asymptotic results to the framework of multifractional brownian motion .",
    "let us introduce the generalized increments of a process @xmath52 .",
    "consider a vector of coefficients @xmath53 and a natural number @xmath54 such that @xmath55 in this case the vector @xmath56 is called a filter of order @xmath57 .",

    "the authors of @xcite only investigate the estimator @xmath76 relative to the filter @xmath77 , which we assume in this subsection from now on .",
    "the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator @xmath76 is summarized in the following theorem .",
    "we remark that the condition for the central limit theorem crucially depends on the interplay between the bandwidth parameter @xmath78 and the hlder index @xmath79 of the function @xmath19 .",

    "the paper @xcite contains the asymptotic theory for a variety of other local estimators of @xmath50 .",
