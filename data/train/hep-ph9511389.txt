    "the theories beyond the standard model ( sm ) such as composite models[1 ] , grand unified theories[2 ] , and @xmath4 superstring - inspired models[3 ] predict the existence of leptoquarks carrying baryon and lepton numbers simultaneously and having the electric charges @xmath5 and @xmath6 [ 4 ] .",
    "the production and possibility of the detection of leptoquarks have been analysed in detail for , for instance , ep [ 5 - 7 ] , hadronic [ 8 ] , and @xmath7 colliders [ 4,9 ] .",
    "it is well known that high enery ep colliders can be converted into a high energy @xmath8 collider with the help of backscattered laser beams [ 10 ] . the single and double leptoquark production in @xmath8 colliders are also analysed in the literature [ 11,12 ] without taking the hadronic structure of photon into account .",
    "namely they neglected the resolved photon contribution . furthermore in these works the distribution of quarks and gluons in the proton",
    "are described by a @xmath9 independent parametrisation which may be misleading since the c.m .",
    "energy for each subprocess supporting @xmath0 is not identical . in this work",
    "we shall analyse the production of vector @xmath10 and scalar leptoquarks @xmath11 in @xmath8 colliders by considering the resolved photon contribution as well .",
    "the article is organized as follows : section 2 describes the theoretical basis and section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and discussions .",
    "the production of leptoquarks in @xmath8 collisions can occur either by direct or resolved photon processes . in the latter case",
    "photon interacts with the proton through its hadronic components.it is clear that the following processes are responsible for the @xmath0 scattering : @xmath12 where processes in ( 1 ) defines the direct photon scattering and those in ( 2 ) defines resolved photon scattering .    the complete @xmath13 invariant lagrangian in the low energy range ( @xmath14),conserving baryon ( b ) and lepton ( l ) numbers , is given by [ 4 ] @xmath15 where @xmath16 . the first two terms in the lagrangian",
    "are given by the following expressions    @xmath17    @xmath18    in @xmath19 and @xmath20 there exist various kinds of leptoquarks interacting with leptons and quarks . here",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 left handed quark and lepton doublets , @xmath24 is the charge conjugated fermion field . among vector leptoquarks , @xmath25",
    "are @xmath23 singlets , @xmath26 are left handed @xmath23 doublets , and @xmath27 is @xmath23 triplet . among scalar leptoquarks , @xmath28",
    "are @xmath23 singlets , @xmath29 are left handed @xmath23 doublets , and @xmath30 is @xmath23 triplet .",
    "note that there are certain constraints on the leptoquark masses and coupling constants from low energy experiments , which follows , for instance , from the absence of @xmath31 at the tree level , and from @xmath32 and @xmath33 mixings [ 13 - 16 ] .",
    "@xmath34 in the lagrangian describes the interaction of scalar leptoquarks with the neutral gauge bosons , and is given by @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the i - th scalar leptoquark field and @xmath37 is the covariant derivative .",
    "unlike the scalar leptoquark case , @xmath38 and @xmath39 vertices involve an ambiguity depending on the nature of vector leptoquarks .",
    "for example , if the vector leptoquarks are gauge bosons of an extended gauge group , then the trilinear vertices are completely and unambigiously fixed by the gauge invariance . when they are not gauge bosons , then the vector leptoquark lagrangian can be regarded as an effective theory .",
    "it is clear that in this effective theory there are many free parameters . in order to restrict the number of these parameters , in addition to @xmath40 invariance and b and l conservations",
    ", we impose the @xmath41 invariance in the effective lagrangian .",
    "moreover we restrict ourselves to operators of dimensionality 4 or less .",
    "there is only one operator @xmath42 complying with these conditions and it describes the anomalous magnetic moment contribution to the trilinear vertex .",
    "thus the effective gauge boson- vector leptoquark lagrangian @xmath43 conserving @xmath41 and containing operators of dimension 4 or less is given by ( see , for example , [ 17 ] ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 runs over all vector leptoquarks , @xmath46 is the leptoquark field strength and @xmath47 is the field strength tensor of photon ( @xmath48 ) or gluon ( @xmath49 ) . in what follows",
    "we shall take anomalous couplings of photon and gluon identical ; @xmath50 .",
    "one can readily obtain the feynman rules for trilinear vertices immediately from @xmath43 @xmath51 where all momenta are incoming . here",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the 4- momenta of photon ( gluon ) and leptoquarks respectively .",
    "we will next turn our attention to the calculation of the cross section for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath0 scattering has the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent the contributions of the direct and resolved photons respectively .",
    "the total cross section for the leptoquark production by direct photon interaction can be obtained by folding the cross section for the elementary process ( 1 ) with the the photon distribution in electron and quark distribution in the proton : @xmath57 in the same manner , the total cross section for leptoquark production by resolved photon contribution can be obtained by folding the cross section of the elementary process ( 2 ) with quark ( gluon ) distribution in the photon , gluon ( quark ) distribution in the proton and photon distribution in the electron :    @xmath58\\;\\sigma_{g q}(xyzs)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) @xmath59 is the @xmath9 dependent distribution function of the parton @xmath60 in the hadron @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is an exception ) . in all these functions",

    "we see that for @xmath101 the cross section grows logarithmically .",
    "this is due to the @xmath102- channel contribution . as we noted before ,",
    "if @xmath82 is a non- gauge particle ( @xmath103 ) this logarithmic dependence can be considered as the low energy manifestation of a more fundamental theory at a higher energy scale .",
    "so , according to the effective theory description , the behaviour of the cross section is acceptable as long as energy is sufficiently low . at high energies",
    ", the effective theory is superseeded by a more fundamental theory , where the increase of the cross section with @xmath70 is stopped and unitarity is preserved . if @xmath82 has the gauge nature ( where @xmath104 ) , the cross section reaches the constant value @xmath105 which is similar to the single @xmath106 boson production in the reaction @xmath107 [ 17 ] in the standard model .    after giving the expression for subprocess cross sections we now turn to the expicit expressions for the distribution functions in ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "the function @xmath108 is the energy spectrum of the backscattered laser photons [ 10 ] @xmath109\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath72 is found as @xmath112 which is the upper limit of the @xmath72 integral in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "in describing the quark and gluon distributions in the proton we shall use the results of [ 18 ] where a @xmath9 dependent parametrisation is given .",
    "we shall not reproduce all the details of the parametrisations here , instead we summarize the general form of the functions and refer the reader to the references for details . @xmath113 parametrizes the quark ( sea plus valence ) distributions in the proton @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the euler s beta function , @xmath116 equals 2 for @xmath117 quark and 1 for @xmath118 quark . the coefficients @xmath119 ( i=1, .. ,9 )",
    "are tabulated in [ 18 ] and they are explicit functions of @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the gluon distribution in the proton is parametrised by @xmath123 having the expression [ 18 ] @xmath124 and again the coefficients @xmath125 are functions of @xmath126 and are tabulated in [ 18 ] .    for the gluon and quark distributions in the photon we shall use the @xmath9 dependent parametrisation given in [ 19 ] . the quark distribution in the photon is parametrised by @xmath127 which is given by @xmath128 where the coefficients @xmath129 are functions of @xmath130 and are tabulated in [ 19 ] .    the quark distribution ( sea plus valence ) in the photon is parametrised by @xmath131 where the coefficients @xmath132 and @xmath133 [ 19 ] change as the number of flavours @xmath134 changes ( in connection with the momentum scale @xmath9 ) and the functions @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( @xmath137 and @xmath138 respectively , in the notation of [ 19 ] ) are given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 , and the coefficients @xmath141 @xmath142 are given in [ 19 ]",
    "we will now analyze the total cross section @xmath143 defined in ( 9 ) for vector and scalar leptoquarks .",
    "we based our analysis only to the first generation so that the quark entering the scattering process is either @xmath117 or @xmath118 , producing in the final state leptoquarks of electromagnetic charge 5/3 or 2/3 [ 4 ] respectively .",
    "although there are many accelerators [ 11,12 ] deserving analysis under such a work , for our purpose it is sufficient to analyze a single accelerator which we choose to be @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "fig.1 and fig.2 show the total cross section in ( 9 ) , at @xmath145 , for @xmath146 ( gauge particle ) and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "we give fig.1 and fig.2 to demonstrate the relative magnitude of the direct and resolved photon contributions as the leptoquark mass changes .",
    "these two are typical examples applicable to all other cases . from fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 we see that for @xmath1 the total cross section in ( 9 ) is strongly dominated by resolved photon contribution in ( 11 ) . moreover , fig .",
    "1 and fig . 2 show , respectively , that for @xmath2 and @xmath3 the total cross section in ( 9 ) is completely determined by the direct photon contribution in ( 10 ) .",
    "we see that the leptoquark mass range where the resolved photon contribution is non negligible is within the mass bounds given in [ 17 ] ; thus , the effects of the hadronic component of photon in @xmath8 colliders are directly observable in future experiments .    fig .",
    "3 shows the dependence of the total cross section in ( 12 ) on @xmath148 for different values of @xmath90 . from this figure",
    "we see that for non- gauge @xmath82 , the cross section in ( 12 ) is considerably enhanced ( suppressed ) as @xmath90 grows ( falls ) to higher ( lower ) values from unity .",
    "especially the @xmath149 case is interesting , because enhancement in the cross section is large for low values of @xmath148 where the resoved photon contribution dominates .",
    "lastly , we observe from this figure that the cross section for @xmath146 is always larger than that for @xmath150 .",
    "finally , in fig.4 we show the variation of the total cross section in ( 13 ) with @xmath151 .",
    "we conclude from this figure that the total cross section for @xmath147 is always larger than that for @xmath152 ( see also [ 11,12 ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have discussed the single leptoquark production in @xmath8 colliders for scalar and vector leptoquarks .",
    "we have analysed the contribution of the hadronic component of the photon to the total cross section .",
