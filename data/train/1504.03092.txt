    "kinetic schemes are widely used for studying the thermodynamic , dynamic , and stochastic properties of macromolecules @xcite .",
    "these schemes are usually selected to be as simple as possible , such as the 2-state schemes for the bound and unbound states of enzymes or receptors and the open and closed states of ion channels .",
    "nevertheless , they can also be rather sophisticated ( e.g. , 8-state inositol trisphosphate receptors @xcite , the 10-state hemoglobin @xcite , and the 56-state chloride channels @xcite ) .",
    "the selection of kinetic schemes is mainly determined by the desired accuracy and the measurable quantities @xcite . since",
    "a low - dimensional scheme can usually be contracted from higher - dimensional ones , there exists a cascade of hierarchical markovian network models suitable for describing the time evolution of the populations of a macromolecule s functional states @xcite .",
    "these networks are anticipated to have indistinguishable kinetics , exhibiting identical mean trajectories after being projected to the low - dimensional network space .",
    "however , models with indistinguishable means do not necessarily have indistinguishable fluctuations . a question that arises",
    "is that which schemes will give more relevant fluctuations to a real system and under which conditions unique fluctuation features can be obtained from different levels of contracted schemes ?",
    "these issues are essential for the reliability of various biological properties derived in terms of the fluctuations of a selected kinetic scheme , such as chemoreception @xcite , membrane conductance @xcite , and ion channel density @xcite .",
    "the inter - network fluctuation relations arise from a comparison between different coarse - grained dynamical systems .",
    "it resembles the comparison between different rate equations in the lumping analysis , widely used in systems biology and general chemical engineering @xcite .",
    "a central issue in that analysis is finding the lumping conditions for eliminating unimportant events or time scales in a large network , of typically over @xmath0 species in systems biology , to reduce its complexity @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this contraction is mathematically analogous to merging experimentally indistinguishable states to obtain simple transition networks for the conformational change of a macromolecule .",
    "for instance , the hodgkin - huxley potassium ion channel has @xmath1 configurations depending on whether its individual four gates are open or closed @xcite . however , this channel is often regarded as a 2-state system , described by whether or not ions can pass through it in a patch - clamp recording . the contraction from a 16-state to a 2-state model",
    "is because the gating current recording is incapable of resolving the detailed structure of the channel configuration . in terms of lumping analysis , this contraction is an approximate lumping @xcite .    despite that correspondence ,",
    "the original lumping analysis focuses on the relations between mean dynamics and is not concerned with fluctuations . to extract this stochastic component",
    ", we generalize the lumping theory from original rate equations ( re ) to chemical master equations ( cme ) and stochastic differential equations ( sde ) and study kinetically equivalent ( ke ) and thermodynamically equivalent ( te ) hierarchical kinetic schemes , under intrinsic and extrinsic noises .",
    "the results go beyond the conventional assumption of  fast relaxations \" and contribute to our understanding of why a kinetic system can be contracted . in the case of extrinsic noise , different kinetic schemes can give different fluctuations even when their average trajectories are the same .",
    "this opens a possibility of identifying a correct kinetic model by observing fluctuations .",
    "notably , lumping conditions here are used for generating complex ke or te networks from simple networks , in opposite to their original goal of reducing complex networks to simple networks . furthermore , for the conformational change of macromolecules discussed below , it is sufficient to focus on linear res and linear lumping transformations .",
    "let system @xmath2 be an @xmath3-dimensional kinetic scheme described by the linear re , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the population of the @xmath6-th state and may represent the mean dynamics of some stochastic processes discussed later , @xmath7 denotes the matrix of rate constants @xmath8 from states @xmath6 to @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and @xmath11^t$ ] represents a state vector , in which the superscript @xmath12 stands for the transpose of a vector . if @xmath13 is an @xmath14 full rank lumping matrix ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 can be contracted into an @xmath17-dimensional vector @xmath18^t$ ] via @xmath19 which is the state vector of some reduced system @xmath20 .",
    "if each column of @xmath13 is a standard unit vector , @xmath13 denotes a proper lumping ( see the example in s1 @xcite ) . since all lumpings in the following discussions are  proper , \" this term will be neglected below .",
    "the re which @xmath21 satisfies is generally an integral - differential equation with a memory kernel @xcite .",
    "if that kernel vanishes , the re has a simple autonomous form as ( 1 ) , @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and network @xmath2 is called `` exactly lumpable . ''",
    "exact lumping makes the contracted system of an autonomous system again autonomous , self - contained , and not having a memory kernel . if the memory kernel does not vanish but is small , @xmath2 is called `` approximately lumpable , '' which has a broad practical application @xcite .",
    "exact lumping is the limiting case of all approximate lumpings when the memory effect tends to zero . equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) together constitute the ke condition between @xmath2 and @xmath20 , or the condition for which @xmath2 can be exactly lumped into @xmath20 .",
    "notice that ( 2 ) alone is insufficient for this condition , because any @xmath13 can lump @xmath16 into some @xmath21 , which is not necessarily self - contained .",
    "quantitatively , the ke condition between @xmath2 and @xmath20 can be expressed by their rate constant matrices @xmath24 which implies @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath13 is used to lump @xmath2 into @xmath20 , the @xmath3 states in @xmath2 are first partitioned into @xmath17 sets @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , by the row vectors of @xmath13 ( see s1 @xcite ) .",
    "then , all states in @xmath26 are merged as the state @xmath28 in @xmath20 and termed  the internal states \" of @xmath28 . using the same procedure to merge all states in @xmath26 on both sides of ( 1 ) , one obtains the ke condition in terms of rate constants @xmath29 for any @xmath28 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 and any @xmath32 , in analogy to that known for finite markov chains @xcite .",
    "notice that the ke condition is fulfilled only when ( 5 ) is satisfied for all @xmath32 . in brief",
    ", the ke condition can be expressed as ( 4 ) or ( 5 ) , or equivalently as ( 2 ) together with ( 3 ) .    since ( 5 )",
    "does not demand fast relaxations between the internal states in @xmath26 , the existence of fast variables or large @xmath8 is not the prerequisite for exact lumpability .",
    "however , lumping analysis can also eliminate fast variables , as the quasi - equilibrium or quasi - steady - state approximations do @xcite .",
    "given a @xmath13 , whether @xmath2 described by ( 1 ) can be exactly lumped into @xmath20 by @xmath13 is decided by whether @xmath20 has an autonomous re ( 3 ) , as discussed above . if two autonomous @xmath2 and @xmath20 are given first instead , whether @xmath2 can be lumped into @xmath20 is decided by whether some @xmath13 can be found to connect them by ( 5 ) .",
    "if such @xmath13 exists , @xmath21 of @xmath20 and @xmath16 of @xmath2 are indistinguishable , in that the trajectories @xmath21 and @xmath33 are identical .",
    "to extract the fluctuation relations of intrinsic noises between hierarchical networks , we extend the lumping analysis from the re ( 1 ) to its cme .",
    "suppose a macromolecule has @xmath3 conformational states whose transition network @xmath2 obeys the kinetic equation ( 1 ) .",
    "if a system consists of @xmath34 macromolecules , its cme @xcite , @xmath35 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describes the evolution of the joint probability @xmath36 of finding the state vector @xmath37^t$ ] at time @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of macromolecules in the @xmath6-th state and @xmath40 .",
    "therein , @xmath41 is related to the @xmath16 in ( 1 ) by @xmath42 , where the sum runs over all accessible @xmath41 .",
    "the vector @xmath43 has values @xmath44 and @xmath45 in its @xmath6-th and @xmath9-th components , respectively , and @xmath46 elsewhere .",
    "it stands for the change of molecule numbers in different states during the reaction shifting one molecule from @xmath6 to @xmath9 .",
    "notice that @xmath47 is a vector whose  @xmath41-th \" component is the probability @xmath36 , just as @xmath16 in ( 1 ) is a vector whose @xmath6-th component is @xmath5 .    for each lumping matrix @xmath13 , which contracts @xmath16 of @xmath2 into @xmath48 of @xmath20",
    ", there exists an associated lumping operator @xmath49 , which contracts @xmath47 into a reduced vector @xmath50 whose @xmath51-th component is ( see s2 @xcite ) @xmath52 where sets @xmath53 are partitioned by @xmath13 as explained in the text that follows ( 4 ) and @xmath54 is a kronecker delta whose value is one when @xmath55 and zero elsewhere .",
    "if @xmath13 is arbitrary , @xmath21 does not necessarily obey a simple re as ( 3 ) and @xmath56 does not necessarily satisfy any cme of the same form as ( 6 ) .",
    "however , if @xmath13 can exactly lump @xmath2 into @xmath20 , @xmath21 does follow ( 3 ) and @xmath56 indeed obeys a simple lumped cme @xmath57 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which turns out to be the cme of @xmath20 ( see s2 @xcite ) . alternatively , suppose the res of @xmath2 and @xmath20 are ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) and some @xmath13 can exactly lump @xmath2 into @xmath20 through ( 2 )",
    ". then their @xmath47 and @xmath58 in ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) are related by ( 7 ) and thus indistinguishable from each other , which is the exact lumpability in terms of joint probabilities .",
    "just as ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) form the ke condition between two res , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) constitute the ke condition on the level of cme . with the same argument as for ( 4 ) , the lumping condition for the cme is @xmath59 notably , the exactly lumped cme ( 9 ) via the ke condition is distinct from the reduced cme entirely based on the time scale separation @xcite .",
    "the above argument indicates that the exact lumpability in re ( 1 ) implies the exact lumpability in its cme ( 6 ) and vice versa ( see s2 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the ke condition is a rather strong condition for systems under intrinsic noises .",
    "it not only conveys the original meaning of identical first moments , @xmath33 and @xmath21 , but also the identities of all other moments , owing to the identity of probabilities , @xmath60 , ( see ( 2.13 ) in s2 @xcite ) .",
    "physically it indicates that experimentally measured fluctuations can not be used for judging whether a state has internal states , if the fluctuations are caused by small numbers of macromolecules . among all moments , of special interest",
    "are the indistinguishable second moments , @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) is an average over the probability @xmath36 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) is the fluctuation around the mean @xmath5 of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 of @xmath68 ) defined in ( 6 ) . in fig .",
    "1 , the indistinguishable variances , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , induced by the intrinsic noises of two ke networks , are numerically confirmed .    besides the strict ke condition",
    ", a kinetic scheme may be selected merely because it is te to the real system @xcite . if two kinetic networks @xmath2 and @xmath20 are te to each other , the stationary states @xmath71 and @xmath72 of their res are related by @xmath73 via some lumping matrix @xmath13 . the stationary solution of",
    "the cme is the multinomial distribution , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath6-th component of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath76 be the vector whose @xmath41-th component is the @xmath77 of @xmath2 and @xmath78 be the vector whose @xmath51-th component is the @xmath79 of a te system @xmath20 of @xmath2 .",
    "one can show that @xmath76 and @xmath78 are related by ( see s3 @xcite ) @xmath80 irrespective of whether @xmath20 is ke to @xmath2 or not .",
    "more precisely , ( 13 ) is sufficient and necessary for the te condition @xmath73 , or is the te condition on the level of stationary joint probability ( see s3 @xcite ) . while under the ke condition the contracted probability @xmath56 must satisfy ( 9 ) at any @xmath38 , under the te condition it must only obey the form ( 12 ) at @xmath81 .    an arbitrary network @xmath2 does not always have a reduced ke system",
    "however , it usually has infinitely many reduced te systems @xmath20 s , which are te to one another . an interesting indication from ( 7 ) and ( 13 )",
    "is that if @xmath2 and @xmath20 are te , but not ke , to each other , their initially distinguishable @xmath47 and @xmath58 will become indistinguishable as @xmath82 , irrespective of which @xmath13 is used to contract @xmath2 to @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "therefore , the lumpability between the probabilities of te systems is similar to the lyapunov function for quantifying entropy production , where kullback - leibler divergence may be a proper lumpability measure .",
    "another frequently used approach for exploring fluctuations is the sde , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a real - valued random variable with the fluctuations @xmath85 about the ensemble mean @xmath16 , which satisfies a deterministic equation as ( 1 ) . here",
    ", @xmath86 is a gaussian white noise with @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for @xmath90 , where the covariance matrix @xmath91 is symmetric , positive semi - definite , and generally time - dependent .",
    "the solution of ( 14 ) , @xmath92 , is also a gaussian random variable .",
    "the conditional covariance of @xmath93 is @xmath94 , which is symmetric and has the time derivative @xmath95 .",
    "this equation is reduced to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) when the system reaches equilibrium as @xmath82 , where @xmath96 vanishes @xcite .",
    "if @xmath86 represents an intrinsic noise , @xmath97 will be the @xmath98 in ( 11 ) , when the system is close to the thermodynamic limit . together with the given @xmath7 it uniquely determines @xmath91 via the fdt .",
    "the @xmath91 in the chemical langevin equation in ref .",
    "@xcite belongs to this category .",
    "if @xmath86 is an extrinsic noise , @xmath97 and @xmath91 can be freely tuned as long as they comply with the fdt .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath20 be two network models approaching a real system , where @xmath2 is described by ( 14 ) and @xmath20 satisfies @xmath99 here @xmath100 and @xmath101 has statistical properties analogous to @xmath86 . if @xmath2 and @xmath20 are ke to each other , they are connected by some @xmath13 via @xmath102 ( notably not @xmath103 ) .",
    "the covariance of the fluctuations of @xmath104 is @xmath105 , where the exchange relation implied by ( 4 ) has been used to obtain the last equality .",
    "since @xmath106 is indistinguishable from @xmath97 , the distinguishiability between the covariances @xmath107 and @xmath97 of two ke systems @xmath20 and @xmath2 can be determined by the difference @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a time - dependent symmetric matrix . while ( 16 ) tells us that @xmath110 implies @xmath111 , its time derivative , @xmath112 , implies the opposite , since @xmath113 is an invertible matrix .",
    "thus , @xmath111 if and only if @xmath114 this relation was already known for @xmath13 replaced by invertible transformations ( ( 8.2.39 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for which the argument is more straightforward than that for ( 17 ) .",
    "relation @xmath110 in ( 17 ) is a weak condition , under which @xmath2 and @xmath20 have only  statistically \" indistinguishable @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "a plausible stronger condition is @xmath117 which fulfills ( 17 ) and generates indistinguishable individual stochastic trajectories @xmath115 and @xmath116 . both ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) lead to indistinguishable covariances and variances of fluctuations of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "together with the indistinguishable means of the ke condition , it yields the indistinguishable gaussian distributions of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "although ( 17 ) shows that @xmath111 if and only if @xmath110 , it does not reveal whether two ke systems should have @xmath111 or not . for intrinsic noises , the indistinguishable covariances in ( 11 ) from the cme approach lead to the expectation that @xmath111 in the sde approach , because the sde can describe cme fluctuations near the thermodynamic limit . according to ( 17 ) , this expectation would be true if @xmath110 , which indeed can be proved ( see @xmath118 of ion channels below and s4 @xcite ) . for extrinsic noises ,",
    "@xmath91 is not decided by @xmath16 and distinct @xmath91 s will generate different fluctuations .",

    "the correct relation between two ke models @xmath2 and @xmath20 of a real macromolecule depends on what we study .",
    "for intrinsic noises , the @xmath91 and @xmath125 of @xmath2 and @xmath20 can be analytically derived and must be related by ( 17 ) . for extrinsic noises ,",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath20 are to approach the same experimental data , their covariances should obey ( 18 ) .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath20 are to approach two individually measured experimental data of the same macromolecule , their fluctuations may have diverse orderings ( 19 ) , because environmental noises in different experiments are likely different . yet",
    ", if the noises are statistically the same , the covariance relation is ( 17 ) , as for intrinsic noises .",
    "experimentally , fluctuations have been measured to predict the ion channels density , e.g. , in nerve fibers of _ rana pipiens _ @xcite . to model this experiment with sde ( 14 ) ,",
    "one considers a variety of channels , each of which can stochastically transit between @xmath3 conformational states , with transition probabilities given by the rate constants in ( 1 ) . according to the canonical theory @xcite or the linear noise approximation @xcite , the stochastic force @xmath86 in ( 14 ) has the covariance @xmath126 , where @xmath5 is the probability of finding a channel in the @xmath6-th state and @xmath127 denotes the kronecker delta .",
    "this covariance depends on the evolution of the mean value @xmath5 and thus varies with time .",
    "if the channel is modeled by a two - state ( open / closed ) system , the @xmath128 entry of its equilibrium covariance @xcite , @xmath129 , complies with onsager s statistical theory of equilibrium ensembles @xcite .",
    "if the channel is modeled by two ke systems of different dimensions with the same form as @xmath118 , they fulfill @xmath130 in ( 17 ) ( see s4 @xcite ) and then @xmath131",
    ". therefore , the indistinguishability @xmath111 from the gaussian probability in the sde approach coincides with the indistinguishability ( 11 ) from the joint probability in the cme approach .",
    "theoretically we generalized the lumping theory from deterministic dynamics to stochastic processes .",
    "it allows us to compare stochastic properties between hierarchical networks , such as networks of small systems , which are sensitive to external noises , or large networks whose species contain small number of copies . in applications",
    ", we introduced lumping techniques from systems biology to molecular biology to explore the fluctuation relations of experimentally indistinguishable kinetic schemes of biomolecules and the legitimacy of estimating macromolecular fluctuations by low - dimensional schemes .",
    "these findings are a kind of contractions beyond the widely discussed ones based on  fast relaxations \" and are useful for extracting correct kinetic models by observing extrinsic noise induced fluctuations .",
    "the analytical results derived from exact lumping here provide limiting properties for networks connected by all kinds of approximate lumping conditions .",
    "they further give insights into more general fluctuation relations in other contraction theories , which usually utilize similar block - triangular matrices to reduce systems @xcite , such as keizer s memoryless contraction @xcite and hierarchical volterra equations in the zwanzig - mori formalism @xcite .",
    "for further study , one may take into account more subtle issues , such as the approximate lumping for non - markovian networks @xcite and the deformation of hidden complexity of free energy surfaces @xcite .",

    "<S> we introduce stochasticity into the traditional lumping analysis , generalize it from rate equations to chemical master equations and stochastic differential equations , and extract the fluctuation relations between kinetically and thermodynamically equivalent networks under intrinsic and extrinsic noises . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide a theoretical basis for the legitimate use of low - dimensional models in the studies of macromolecular fluctuations and , more generally , for exploring stochastic features in different levels of contracted networks in chemical and biological kinetic systems . </S>"
