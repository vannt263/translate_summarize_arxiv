    "special attention attracts the idea ( recently realized experimentally @xcite ) of entanglement generation between distant spins @xcite .",
    "it was noted bayat2007transfe that while the quality of entanglement transfer in spin chains increases with the dimension of interacting spins , the average fidelity still significantly diminishes with the distance between the spins . in order to enhance the pairewise entanglement we propose to use correlations stored in the initial _ factorized _ state of a chain consisting of large size spins .",
    "the main idea is to prepare each spin of the chain in an appropriate squeezed state , so that the correlation from the `` internal degree of freedom '' is transferred into the spin - spin entanglement during the evolution of the system .",
    "it worth noting , that the possibility of correlation transfer between subsystems of various physical systems has been widely discussed both from theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite perspectives .",
    "this article is organized as follows : first we show that for a particular type of spin - spin interaction it is possible to choose an optimal initial spin squeezed state , so that the maximum amount of entanglement between neighbors spins , as well as the correlation of a spin with the rest of the particles in the chain substantially increase ; then , we argue that the dynamics of the correlation transfer for large spins can be fairly well described from the semiclassical point of view using the language of the phase - space distributions , which opens the possibility for large - scale simulations of correlation dynamics in spin chains .",
    "let us consider an open chain of @xmath1 spins of size @xmath2 with homogeneous ising - like interaction ( the coupling constant is taken to be unity ) , governed by the hamiltonian @xmath3initially the spins are prepared in a factorized state@xmath4where each spin is in the coherent state localized on the equator of the bloch sphere subjected to a squeezing transformation ( generated by @xmath5 ) and a rotation around @xmath6-axes in the maximum squeezing direction ( in the corresponding tangent plane ) , @xmath7    since @xmath8 is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( hami ) some specific spin - spin correlations arise during the hamiltonian evolution .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath9 is    @xmath10    the simplest characteristics of a correlation between a selected spin and the rest of the spin in the chain is the * *  * * _ i_-concurrence @xcite , @xmath11where @xmath12 is the purity of the @xmath13-th spin .",
    "the degree of entanglement between a pair of spins can be described by the negativity @xcite , @xmath14where @xmath15 is the trace norm of the partially transposed ( on the @xmath16-th spin ) reduced two - particle ( @xmath16-@xmath17 ) density matrix @xmath18 .",
    "we have numerically optimized the @xmath19-concurrence with respect to the squeezing parameter @xmath20 and the rotation angle @xmath21 for a ) a @xmath22-th spin , @xmath23 ; b ) the last ( first ) spin in the chain .",

    "it is worth nothing that the instants , when the maximum value in the @xmath36-concurrence is reached does not depend nor on the spin size @xmath2 , neither on the longitude of the chain .",

    "unfortunately , the numerical optimization becomes quite involved for non - diagonal spin chain hamiltonians and large spin size . in order to be able to carry out such optimization",
    "it is appropriate to use the phase - space methods . according to this approach",
    "we can reformulate the quantum mechanics on the language of distributions ( symbols of operators ) in the classical phase - space , where both states and observables are considered as smooth functions in such a way that average values are computed by convoluting symbols of the density matrix and the corresponding operators @xcite .",
    "in addition , the quantum dynamics can be efficiently simulated in terms of the spin wigner function defined as an invertible map  of the density matrix @xmath65  to a smooth distribution @xmath66 on the two - dimensional sphere @xmath67        in the large spin ( semiclassical ) limit , @xmath48 , the wigner function satisfies the louville equation @xcite , @xmath73where @xmath74 and@xmath75is the poisson brackets on the sphere , being @xmath76 the symbol of the hamiltonian .",

    "we have tested eq.([nn ] ) for several randomly chosen density matrices .",
    "one of the crucial ingredients of the phase - space approach is that the wigner function of the initial state can be efficiently approximated in the limit @xmath48 by using the asymptotic form of the mapping kernel @xcite .",
