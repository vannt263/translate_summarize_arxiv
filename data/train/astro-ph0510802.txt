    "star clusters in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc 6822 have been first reported by @xcite and systematically investigated by @xcite . the most recent study by @xcite used the available hst archive data and cataloged all the star clusters identified including one genuine globular cluster hubble vii .",
    "however , no star cluster survey in the outer halo of ngc 6822 has ever been tried before , although the existence of a rather large stellar halo around the galaxy was suggested by @xcite from their carbon star survey .",
    "visual inspection of the wide field survey data around ngc 6822 has revealed three new star clusters . the locations and morphologies of these clusters",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig ] . from morphological and photometric studies ,",
    "two clusters , sc1 and sc2 , are regarded genuine old globular clusters with ages more than 3 gyrs ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hwang et al . 2005 ) for details ) .",
    "one noteworthy point is that the new star clusters are distributed to the very remote places ( _ left _ panel of figure  [ fig ] ) .",
    "the projected distance from the ngc 6822 center to sc1 , the most remote cluster , is about 12 kpc . for comparison ,",
    "ngc 1841 , the outermost star cluster in the lmc , is located at about 13 kpc from the lmc center .",
    "another important point in the images is that all three clusters are extended and are clearly resolved into stars , whereas hubble vii is not resolved at all in our data ( _ right _ panel of figure  [ fig ] ) .",
    "further investigation shows that the half - light radii of these new clusters are larger than 10 pc and even larger than 20 pc for sc1 .",
    "the existence of the newly discovered star clusters suggests that the underlying halo has a different structure from a giant hi disk - like cloud which is extended along nw - se direction ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de blok & walter 2000 ) ) .",
    "these clusters also provide a proof that the halo of ngc 6822 is quite larger than previously expected ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lee & hwang 2005 ) in this volume ) .",
    "the extended structures of these new clusters are very unusual features . the sc1 , among these , is found to be as extended as new star clusters recently discovered in the halo of m31 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* huxor et al . 2005 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lee et al . 2005 ) ) . the formation mechanism of these extended star clusters , including the correlation with evolutionary history of the host galaxies ,",
    "is not clearly understood yet , requiring further studies ."
