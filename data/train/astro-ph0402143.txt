    "neutron stars are the most compact stars in the universe .",
    "they have masses @xmath2 and radii @xmath3 km , and they contain matter at supernuclear densities in their cores .",
    "our knowledge of neutron star interiors is still uncertain and , in particular , the composition and equation of state of matter at supernuclear densities in neutron star cores can not be predicted with confidence .",
    "microscopic calculations are model dependent and give a range of possible equations of state ( e.g. , lattimer & prakash 2001 ; haensel 2003 ) , from stiff to soft ones , with different compositions of the inner cores ( nucleons , pion or kaon condensates , hyperons , quarks ) .    one of the strong incentives for studying the thermal evolution of neutron stars is the promise that , by confronting observation and theory , one may learn about matter in the stellar interior .",
    "the foundation of the theory of neutron star cooling was laid by tsuruta & cameron ( 1966 ) .",
    "the development of the theory was reviewed in the 1990s , e.g. , by pethick ( 1992 ) , page ( 1998a , b ) , tsuruta ( 1998 ) , and yakovlev et al .",
    "the latter authors presented also a historical review covering earlier studies .",
    "some recent results have been summarized by yakovlev et al .",
    "( 2002b , 2004a ) . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss the current state of the cooling theory and compare it with observations of thermal radiation from isolated neutron stars .",
    "we shall also outline the related problem of accreting neutron stars and its application to the quiescent radiation from soft x - ray transients .",
    "we shall describe mainly results that have been obtained since the middle of 1990s .",
    "the emphasis in this review is on discussing the dependence of the cooling behavior of neutron stars on physical properties of the matter and comparing the results with observation , rather than giving a detailed account of the results of microscopic theory .",
    "let us begin by describing observations of thermal radiation from isolated neutron stars  cooling neutron stars which are not reheated by accretion .",
    "the detection of the thermal radiation is a complicated problem .",
    "active processes in magnetospheres of young pulsars ( with ages @xmath4 yrs ) result in strong non - thermal emission which obscures the thermal radiation .",
    "old pulsars ( @xmath5 ) may have hot polar spots due to the pulsar activity , and the radiation from these spots may be stronger than the thermal radiation from the rest of the stellar surface , which is colder .",
    "this complicates the extraction of the thermal radiation component from the observed spectra .    as a result of these difficulties ,",
    "thermal radiation has been reliably detected only from several isolated middle - aged neutron stars ( @xmath6 yrs ) , where it appears to be an appreciable fraction of the total radiation .",
    "the main parameters of these stars ( rotation period @xmath7 , distance @xmath8 , and surface magnetic field @xmath9 ) are listed in table [ tab : param ] ; ages @xmath10 and effective surface temperatures @xmath11 are presented in table [ tab : observ ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : observ ] and discussed below .",
    "the surface temperatures are @xmath12 k. thus , the thermal radiation is emitted mainly in soft x - rays , which can be detected by orbital x - ray observatories .",
    "the first x - ray observatories of such a type were _ einstein _",
    "( 19781981 ) and _ exosat _",
    "( 19831986 ) .",
    "a very important contribution to observations of cooling neutron stars was made by the _",
    "rosat _ observatory ( 19901998 ) .",
    "a new era began in 1999 with the launching of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    ", new x - ray observatories of outstanding capability .",
    "the rayleigh - jeans tail of the thermal emission from some isolated neutron stars has been observed in the optical with ground - based telescopes .    to compare the observations with theory , we need mainly the neutron star effective temperatures @xmath11 and ages @xmath10 .",
    "because neutron stars are compact , the effects of general relativity must be taken into account ( see , e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 , thorne 1977 ) . to be specific , we shall denote the gravitational mass of the star by @xmath13 and its circumferential radius by @xmath14 ; @xmath11 will denote the effective temperature and @xmath15 the thermal photon luminosity in the local reference frame of the star .",
    "here @xmath16 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the apparent ( redshifted ) effective temperature @xmath17 and luminosity @xmath18 , as detected by a distant observer , are @xmath19 where @xmath20 km is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "one often introduces the apparent radius @xmath21 which the observer would see if the telescope could resolve the star .",
    "the surface temperature distribution of a magnetized star is nonuniform , and for this case we shall introduce the mean effective temperature defined by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total thermal luminosity .",
    "the values of @xmath11 are obtained by fitting the observed spectra with theoretical models .",
    "the model spectra usually include thermal and non - thermal components .",
    "the thermal component is described ( e.g. , zavlin & pavlov 2002 ) either by a black - body spectrum or by a spectrum provided by a neutron star atmosphere model ( with or without a magnetic field ) .",
    "the atmosphere models studied theoretically in greatest detail are those composed of hydrogen .",
    "the depth from which a photon emerges from a hydrogen atmosphere increases noticeably with photon energy due to the strong energy dependence of radiative opacities .",
    "thus , more energetic photons emerge from deeper ( and hotter ) layers and make the spectra harder than the black - body one , for the same @xmath11 ( i.e. , for the same thermal flux @xmath24 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath11 inferred from hydrogen atmosphere models are typically about one half of those inferred using a black - body spectrum .",
    "iron atmosphere models give spectra whose gross behavior is close to the black - body spectrum , but with spectral lines in addition .",
    "theoretical atmosphere models are still far from perfect , especially for cool stars ( @xmath11 much below @xmath25 k ) and for stars with strong magnetic fields ( @xmath26 g ) , because of the problems of ionization equilibrium and spectral opacities in the cool and/or strongly magnetized atmospheric plasma .",
    "the parameters used for fitting observed spectra are : @xmath11 , @xmath14 , the surface gravity @xmath27 ( and hence , the stellar mass @xmath13 , which is completely determined by @xmath14 and @xmath27 ) , and the surface chemical composition .",
    "one can also add at least two parameters for the non - thermal radiation component ( described commonly by a power - law spectrum and specified by an intensity and a power - law index ) .",
    "one should , in addition , specify the distance to the star and correct the theoretical spectrum for interstellar absorption , i.e. , specify the column density of interstellar hydrogen .",
    "the distances and column densities can be highly uncertain .",
    "in such cases , they too are treated as free parameters .",
    "thus , the fitting contains many parameters .",
    "some of them are determined from the fitting procedure with large errors .",
    "to reduce the errors , one often fixes certain parameters , for instance @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in some cases",
    ", one needs to introduce a second thermal ( black - body ) radiation component characterized by its own effective surface temperature @xmath28 and radius @xmath29 .",
    "one usually finds @xmath30 and @xmath31 , in which case the second component has a natural interpretation as thermal emission from a hot spot on the stellar surface associated with the pulsar activity and not related to the thermal radiation emerging from the interior of the star .",
    "stellar ages may also be rather uncertain .",
    "all in all , the observational data in tables [ tab : param ] and [ tab : observ ] represent the current state of the art .",
    "it has been a challenge to obtain them , but they are still not very precise .

    "the data seem to require both slower and faster cooling .",
    "the _ fast cooling _ occurs at @xmath50 via the powerful direct urca process .",
    "the cooling curves are again not too sensitive to the stellar mass",

    "( [ therm - isotherm ] ) during the neutrino cooling stage now yields @xmath53 min@xmath54 , giving @xmath55 k for @xmath56 yrs .",
    "the _ transition _ from the slow to fast cooling takes place in a very narrow range of @xmath13 because of the huge difference in the emissivities of the modified and direct urca processes , and the sharp threshold of the direct urca process ( left panel of fig .  [",

    "some sources ( in particular , vela , psr b170644 , geminga , rx j1856.43754 ) fall exactly in this transition zone , and therefore could be explained if they had almost the same mass .",
    "this unlikely assumption can be avoided by including the effects of nucleon superfluidity ( see sect .  [ psf ] ) .",
    "let us stress the _ universality _ of the cooling curves ( page & applegate 1992 ) .",
    "the curves for low - mass stars are insensitive not only to the values of @xmath13 ( as long as @xmath57 ) , but also to the equation of state at high densities .",
    "the effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : universal ] , where we show the cooling of 1.1  stars , with four equations of state . model a is our basic equation of state ( sect .  [ input ] ) , while b , c , and d are modifications of the equations of state of prakash et al .",

    "they are examples of moderate , stiff , and soft equations of state ( yielding @xmath42=1.730 , 1.942 , and 1.461 ) . although the equations of state and the stellar models are different , the cooling curves of low - mass stars are almost the same , especially if one plots @xmath59 ( left panel ) rather than @xmath60 ( right panel ) .",
    "this universality is easily explained from eq .",
    "( [ therm - isotherm ] ) : the cooling rate at the neutrino cooling stage is proportional to @xmath61 , the ratio of the total neutrino luminosity and heat capacity . while both @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on the stellar model , their ratio is almost model - independent .",
    "thus , we have actually one universal _",

    "this curve is plotted in fig .",

    "figure [ tript ] shows slow and fast cooling of nonsuperfluid 1.3  ( solid lines ) and 1.5 ( dashed lines ) stars .",
    "the left panel illustrates the effects of accreted envelopes in nonmagnetized stars .",
    "we present the cooling curves for some values of @xmath65 , the mass of relatively light elements ( h , he , c , or o ) in the heat - blanketing envelopes .",

    "the internal stellar temperature @xmath68 is determined by neutrino emission , and is insensitive to the physics of the heat - blanketing envelope .",
    "the surface temperature adjusts to @xmath68 according to the @xmath11@xmath68 relation .",
    "since accreted envelopes conduct heat better than ones composed of heavier elements , the surface temperature of a star with an accreted envelope is noticeably higher . even an amount of accreted matter as small as @xmath69 can appreciably change the cooling .",
    "the cooler the star , the smaller @xmath65 which yields the same cooling as the fully accreted blanketing envelope .",
    "the reason for this is that the greatest contribution to the difference between surface and interior temperatures occurs in a thin layer where matter is partially degenerate .",
    "the cooler the star , the closer this layer is to the surface , and the smaller the amount of accreted matter is needed to change the composition of this layer .    for @xmath70",
    "yrs the star enters the photon cooling stage when the cooling is governed by @xmath11 ( sect .",
    "[ main equations ] ) .",
    "an accreted envelope leads then to faster cooling ( more rapid fall of @xmath11 with time ) .",
    "thus , the effects of light elements on the surface temperature during the neutrino and photon cooling stages are opposite .",
    "this reversal of the effect of light elements when passing from one stage to the other has a straightforward physical explanation , and is well known .    the middle panel of fig .",

    "the fast cooling of cooler magnetized ( 1.5 @xmath76 ) neutron stars is somewhat different : a magnetic field @xmath72 g has almost no effect on @xmath11 , while fields @xmath77 g affect the cooling much more than for slow - cooling neutron stars .",

    "[ tript ] shows cooling curves for neutron stars with fully accreted envelopes and the same dipole magnetic fields as in the middle panel . for a star with @xmath78 g during the neutrino cooling stage , the effect of the accreted envelope is stronger than the effect of the magnetic field . for higher @xmath79 , the magnetic effect dominates ;",
    "the accreted envelope produces a rather weak additional rise in @xmath11 .",
    "the main outcome of these studies is that even ultrahigh magnetic fields do not change the average surface temperatures of young and warm neutron stars as much as an accreted envelope can . at the same time , strong fields induce a strongly nonuniform surface temperature distribution ( see , e.g. , potekhin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the considerations above show that the effects of magnetic fields and accreted envelopes in nonsuperfluid neutron stars can not reconcile theory and observation .",

    "[ psf ] and [ pnsf ] we consider nonmagnetic neutron stars without accreted envelopes .",
    "the observations can be explained by the cooling of superfluid neutron stars assuming that _ proton superfluidity is rather strong _ at @xmath80 , while the @xmath35p@xmath36 _ neutron superfluidity is rather weak_. we start with the effects of proton superfluidity ( kaminker et al .",
    "2001 ) and neglect neutron pairing .",

    "consequently , neutron - neutron bremsstrahlung ( table [ tab : slow ] ) , which is weaker , becomes the leading neutrino emission mechanism .",
    "second , proton superfluidity gradually dies out with increasing @xmath82 , smoothly removing the reduction of fast neutrino emission .",
    "this broadens the direct urca threshold , creating _ a finite transition zone _ at densities @xmath83 between the regions with slow neutrino emission ( @xmath84 ) and rapid neutrino emission ( @xmath85 . for model 2p , superfluidity extends deeper into the stellar core and shifts the transition zone to higher densities . the direct urca threshold can also be broadened by the thermal effects and by magnetic fields ( baiko & yakovlev 1999 ) but these effects are usually weaker than the broadening provided by superfluidity ( yakovlev et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "the cooling curves of neutron stars of different masses with proton superfluidity models 1p and 2p are plotted in the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:1p2p ] , respectively .",
    "we see that proton superfluidity leads to _ three _ characteristic types of cooling neutron stars ( kaminker et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "_ low - mass _ neutron stars , with @xmath86 , have weaker neutrino emission than low - mass nonsuperfluid neutron stars , and they form a class of _ very slowly cooling neutron stars_. their cooling curves are almost universal ( as in sect .  [ nosf ] ) : they are independent of the stellar mass , the model for proton superfluidity , and the equation of state in the stellar core .",
    "these cooling curves lie above the basic standard cooling curve , and can explain the observations of rx j08224300 and psr b105552 .",
    "thus we can treat these two sources as low - mass neutron stars . with some reservations , rx j0720.43125",
    "may also be attributed to this class ( although , given the large observational uncertainties , it may belong to the class of cooler , medium - mass stars ) .    _ high - mass , rapidly cooling _ neutron stars , with @xmath87 , cool mainly via fast neutrino emission from the inner core .",
    "the cooling curves are again almost independent of @xmath13 , equation of state and model for proton superfluidity , and they are actually the same as for high - mass nonsuperfluid stars . all observed isolated neutron stars are much warmer than these models .    _ medium - mass _ neutron stars ( @xmath88 ) show cooling which is _ intermediate _ between very slow and fast ; it depends on @xmath13 , the equation of state and proton superfluidity .",
    "roughly , the masses of these stars range from @xmath40 to 1.55  for the 1p superfluidity model and from 1.4 to 1.65  for the 2p superfluidity model . by varying @xmath89 from @xmath90",
    "to @xmath91 we obtain a family of cooling curves which fill the ( shaded ) space between the curves of low - mass and high - mass stars .",

    "in fact any _ mild _ neutron superfluidity in the stellar core with a realistic @xmath92 profile and @xmath95 k contradicts observations of at least some hotter and older objects ( independently of the proton pairing ) and _ should be rejected _ on these grounds ( yakovlev et al .",
    "neutron superfluidity with a smaller @xmath96 would come into play only in the late stages of neutron star evolution and has no effect on the cooling of middle - aged stars .",

    "the simultaneous presence of strong neutron and proton superfluids in the core would greatly reduce the stellar heat capacity and initiate a rapid cooling of low - mass stars at @xmath100 yrs , in sharp contradiction with the observations of old and warm sources .",
    "finally , very strong neutron or proton superfluidity ( @xmath101 k ) everywhere throughout neutron star cores would suppress the direct urca process and produce slow cooling of neutron stars of any mass during the neutrino cooling stage ( yakovlev et al .",

    "the physics of emission from the surface of these objects is very different from that of ordinary neutron stars because of the very high plasma frequency of surface quark layers .",
    "the issue has recently been addressed by page & usov ( 2002 ) .",
    "now we discuss thermal states of accreting neutron stars in soft x - ray transients ( sxrts ) .",
    "we shall follow mainly the considerations of yakovlev et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004b ) .",
    "sxrts undergo periods of outburst activity ( lasting from days to months ) superimposed on quiescent periods ( lasting from months to decades ) ; see , e.g. , chen et al .",
    "their activity is most probably regulated by accretion from a disk around the neutron star . during quiescence ,",
    "when accretion is absent or greatly suppressed , some sources emit rather intense thermal radiation , which indicates that the neutron stars are rather hot . a possible explanation for these sources ( brown et al .  1998 )",
    "is that they are neutron stars powered by _ deep crustal heating _",
    "( haensel & zdunik 1990 , 2003 ) produced by nuclear transformations in accreted matter as it sinks into the inner crust under the weight of newly accreted material .",
    "the total energy release is about 1.11.5 mev per accreted baryon , and the total heating power is @xmath133 erg s@xmath128 , where @xmath134 is the mass accretion rate .",
    "the main energy release is produced by pycnonuclear reactions at @xmath135 g @xmath127 ( several hundred meters below the surface ) .",
    "the heat is spread over the neutron star by thermal conduction and radiated away by emission of photons from the surface and neutrinos from the interior . generally , the _ surface temperature depends on the internal structure of the star _ , and this gives a new method for studying the internal structure .",
    "= 9.5 cm    neutron stars in sxrts are thermally inertial objects with thermal relaxation times @xmath136 yr ( colpi et al .",
    "thus their internal temperatures @xmath137 ( and hence their surface temperatures ) are insensitive to the transient nature of the accretion rate .",
    "accordingly , @xmath137 can be determined by solving the thermal balance equation ( [ therm - isotherm ] ) in the steady - state approximation : @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the time - averaged accretion rate and @xmath18 is the quiescent thermal luminosity .",
    "a solution gives a _ heating curve _  a relationship between the thermal luminosity @xmath140 as a function of accretion rate , or , equivalently , @xmath141 .",
    "the heating curves of accreting neutron stars are closely related to the cooling curves of isolated neutron stars ( e.g. , colpi et al .",
    "2001 , yakovlev et al .  2003 ) since they are determined by essentially the same physics .",
    "the main difference is that the steady states of accreting neutron stars are independent of the heat capacity of the star , although the approach to such a state does depend on the heat capacity .    by analogy with the cooling theory ,",
    "accreting neutron stars may operate in the photon - emission regime ( @xmath142 ) or the neutrino - emission regime ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the latter regime , which is very sensitive to neutron star structure , is realized at higher @xmath134 ( e.g. , yakovlev et al .",
    "for instance , a low - mass nonsuperfluid neutron star with a core of neutrons , protons and electrons enters the neutrino - emission regime for @xmath144  yr@xmath128 , while a high - mass star does so for @xmath145  yr@xmath128 .    just as in the case of cooling isolated neutron stars ( sects .",

    "high - mass _ stars have much stronger neutrino emission and are the coldest ones",
    ". _ medium - mass _ stars are intermediate between the hottest and the coldest ones .",
    "the @xmath140 curves are sensitive to the presence in the surface layers of accreted matter containing light elements which remain unburnt in thermonuclear reactions by the beginning of a quiescent stage .",
    "figure [ fig : trans ] presents the limiting @xmath140 curves for three different scenarios of neutrino emission , basically the same as those studied in sect .",
    "[ exotica ] ( left panel of fig .",

    "it is assumed that thermonuclear burning in the surface layers produces fe - like elements beneath the unburnt matter .",
    "the dashed curve is calculated for the 1.1 neutron star whose core is composed of neutrons , protons and electrons ( the same equation of state as in sect .

    "moreover , the assumption that deep crustal burning of accreted matter powers the quiescent thermal emission of sxrts remains a hypothesis .",

    "( _ b _ ) in the cores of low - mass stars , neutrino emission is slower than that produced by the modified urca process . for instance , this emission may be provided by neutron - neutron bremsstrahlung while other potentially efficient neutrino processes may be suppressed by strong superfluidity of protons .",

    "<S> observation of cooling neutron stars can potentially provide information about the states of matter at supernuclear densities . </S>",
    "<S> we review physical properties important for cooling such as neutrino emission processes and superfluidity in the stellar interior , surface envelopes of light elements due to accretion of matter and strong surface magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino processes include the modified urca process , and the direct urca process for nucleons and exotic states of matter such as a pion condensate , kaon condensate , or quark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of theoretical cooling curves on physical input and observations of thermal radiation from isolated neutron stars are described . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of observation and theory leads to a unified interpretation in terms of three characteristic types of neutron stars : high - mass stars which cool primarily by some version of the direct urca process ; low - mass stars , which cool via slower processes ; and medium - mass stars , which have an intermediate behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the related problem of thermal states of transiently accreting neutron stars with deep crustal burning of accreted matter is discussed in connection with observations of soft x - ray transients .    _ </S>",
