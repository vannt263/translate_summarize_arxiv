    "homogeneous binary fluid mixtures phase segregate into two phases with different compositions when quenched into thermodynamically unstable regions of their phase diagram , a process also called spinodal decomposition .",
    "this is achieved by lowering the temperature well below the so called spinodal temperature . for incompressible , 50:50 mixtures , also called critical or symmetric mixtures , these phases form interconnected domains which at late times produce a bicontinuous structure with sharp , well developed interfaces . for asymmetric mixtures ( phases with different densities ) there is a phase transition at early times from an interpenetrating structure termed as `` bicontinuous '' to the so - called `` droplet phase '' , which in turn undergoes subsequent coarsening via coalescence @xcite .",
    "the composition of a binary immiscible fluid is one of the variables affecting its dynamics .",
    "fields where spinodal decomposition is of industrial relevance comprise the metallurgical , oil , food , paints and coatings industries .",
    "polymer blends and gels immersed in a solvent are also potentially important applications where phase separation occurs and needs to be controlled @xcite .",
    "spinodal decomposition has been extensively studied by experimental @xcite , analytical @xcite , and numerical @xcite approaches .",
    "the fact that it entails a variety of mechanisms that can act concurrently and at different length and time scales has made it a testbed for complex fluid simulation methods . among the latter",
    "are hydrodynamic lattice gases @xcite , the lattice boltzmann equation @xcite , and dissipative particle dynamics @xcite .",
    "despite all the interest attracted by the subject , how the mechanisms responsible for domain separation act remains on unsettled grounds . in particular , the dynamics of the late time , true asymptotic growth is unclear .",
    "also , the dynamical scale invariance hypothesis ( to be explained later on in this paper ) , which is treated almost as canonical by analytical and numerical approaches to solving the continuum , local - thermodynamic cahn - hilliard equations , has experimentally been proven to fail at least under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "numerical studies on spinodal decomposition include methods at the _ macroscopic scale _ , based on the numerical solution of either the navier - stokes @xcite or the cahn - hilliard equations @xcite , the _ mesoscopic scale _ , where lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) methods @xcite , lattice gases @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics @xcite , and ising @xcite approaches are examples , and the _ microscopic scale _ , with classical molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "fluid dynamical methods in the mesoscopic scale came to light as a way to grasp the relevant thermohydrodynamical behaviour with as little computational effort as possible .",
    "this is achieved by evolving a microworld in which the usual vast number of molecular degrees of freedom and characterisation have been drastically reduced , based on the fact that , away enough from critical points , a fluid s macrostate is pretty much insensitive to many of its microscopic properties .",
    "some regard the cahn - hilliard equations to be within the mesoscopic scale .",
    "they derive from the van der waals formulation of quasilocal thermodynamics @xcite , extended by cahn and hilliard @xcite , and aim at solving a langevin - like diffusion equation for the conserved order parameter .",
    "this equation involves a chemical potential derived from a phenomenological , ginzburg - landau expansion for the free energy , and leads to phase segregation if the temperature is below a critical value .",
    "the scheme commonly used for the study of phase segregation in immiscible fluids is termed cahn - hilliard _ model h _",
    "@xcite ; hydrodynamics is included by introducing mass currents , which couple the diffusion equation with the navier - stokes equation .",
    "thermal effects are sometimes included in the dynamics by the addition of a noise term satisfying a fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "cahn - hilliard equations have been applied to model the segregation dynamics of deep and sudden thermal quenches of fluid mixtures .",
    "such quenches are usually chosen to be sudden to avoid thermal noise effects and set up an initial condition that quickly leads to a state of steep domain walls and where diffusion is negligible compared with hydrodynamic effects , thus leaving the conditions that the dynamical scaling hypothesis requires .",
    "however , local - equilibrium can not be guaranteed for a mixture undergoing a sudden quench , which puts the existence of a free energy and the equilibrium states modelled by it on rather shaky grounds .",
    "the lattice - boltzmann method we use in this work is the shan - chen lattice - bgk scheme for binary immiscible and incompressible fluid flow @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium state for each pure fluid is chosen to be a local isothermal maxwellian , and shan and chen s contribution to the lattice - bgk scheme comes through the phase separation prescription .",
    "this is incorporated via intercomponent repulsive mean - field forces between elements of fluids ( meant to be at a mesoscopic scale ) which alter the local equilibrium , and not through a local equilibrium reproducing a chemical potential derived from a free - energy functional .",
    "the shan - chen method has been used by martys and douglas @xcite to qualitatively simulate spinodal decomposition for critical and off - critical quenches in 3d .",
    "there have been recent quantitative studies in 2d using this method for critical spinodal decomposition @xcite . an early study on critical 2d and 3d",
    "spinodal decomposition was put forward by alexander _",
    "_ @xcite using the lattice - boltzmann method proposed by gunstensen _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "lattice - bgk methods based on a ginzburg - landau free - energy functional @xcite achieve multiphase behaviour by using two separate distribution functions : one for the mass density and one for the order parameter , this being defined as the difference between the phases densities .",
    "higher - order velocity moments of these distributions are imposed to coincide with thermomechanical quantities obtained from the free energy .",
    "the term `` top - down '' is used in the literature to address this type of approach , whereas we shall use `` bottom - up '' in the remainder to signify fully mesoscopic methods .",
    "some criticisms of top - down approaches @xcite include their frequent lack of galilean invariance ( although inamuro @xcite presented a model that does exhibit this property ) , and their phenomenological character .",
    "studies of spinodal decomposition using these methods are described in the works of wagner _",

    "numerical instabilities are a great cause for concern in lattice - boltzmann methods , a study of which will be addressed for the lattice - bgk method we employ in this work .",
    "their sources are two - fold : ( a ) the finite - difference , discrete - velocity scheme used to solve the bgk - boltzmann equation prevents the existence of an h - theorem , and ( b ) the approximations used for the equilibrium distribution do not guarantee its positivity , and hence that of the nonequilibrium distribution .",
    "linear stability analyses have been applied to the lattice - bgk model by sterling @xcite , and in more detail by lallemand and luo @xcite comparing a lattice - bgk model to a generalised lb model with a different relaxation time for each physical flux .",
    "@xcite gave conditions for the mach number and the shear viscosity such that the lattice - bgk scheme produces positive mass densities .",
    "new approaches to unconditionally stable lattice - boltzmann models have recently appeared too @xcite .",
    "they prove the existence of functionals satisfying an h - theorem .",
    "our objective in this work is to present a bottom - up lattice - bgk method for the study of scaling laws in the spinodal decomposition of critical fluid mixtures in three dimensions .",
    "this method has certain advantages over lattice - bgk methods based on a free - energy functional , namely , a smaller number of free parameters to tune , galilean invariance guaranteed , and a simpler equilibrium distribution .",
    "moreover , it refuses to inject macroscopic information into the mesoscopic dynamics as the top - down methods do , on the grounds that for lattice - bgk methods there is no h - theorem available that guarantees an unconditional approach to a given equilibrium .",
    "indeed , in the context of general complex fluid applications , an expression for the free energy itself may be unknown , and/or its validity be questioned for regimes far enough from local equilibrium , making a top down approach not even viable .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ spin - decomp ]",
    "we discuss the dynamical scaling hypothesis , which asserts that after the quench all length scales in the mixture share the same growth law with time .",
    "the modified shan - chen model we use is explained in section [ sclb ] ; section [ surftens ] introduces the method we use to measure surface tension , while in section [ simul ] we describe the simulations performed and the growth laws and scaling functions drawn from them which allow to test the validity of the dynamical scaling hypothesis .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in section [ conclu ] .",
    "after domain walls have achieved their thinnest configuration via diffusion , the time evolution of the bicontinuous structure that is produced in the phase segregation process that symmetric mixtures undergo presents geometrical self - similarity to the initial stages of such a process when the structure is zoomed in at increasing magnification .",
    "this leads us to the _ dynamical scaling hypothesis _ , which states that at late times , when diffusive effects have died out , there is a unique characteristic length scale @xmath12 which grows with time such that the geometrical structure of domains is ( in a statistical sense ) independent of time when lengths are scaled by @xmath12 @xcite",
    ". this amounts to saying that all length scales have the same time evolution .",
    "such a characteristic length scale must be universal for all fluids with the same shear viscosity , @xmath13 , density , @xmath14 , and surface tension @xmath15 , provided that no mechanisms are involved in their late stage growth other than viscous dissipation , fluid inertia and capillary forces , respectively .",
    "this is so because , as we shall see later on , only one length scale can be constructed out of the fluid s parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , these being the only ones present in a hydrodynamic description of the mixture via the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the characteristic length scale is usually measured by looking at the first zero crossing of the equal - time pair - correlation function of the order parameter fluctuations @xcite ,    @xmath16    where , on the lattice , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the spatial volume , @xmath19 is the volume of the lattice s unit cell ( hence @xmath20 is the number of nodes in the lattice ) , @xmath21 is the time parameter in time steps , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are spatial vectors , and @xmath24 are the order parameter fluctuations , where @xmath25 is the order parameter for our binary fluid ( say , a mixture of red ( r ) and blue ( b ) phases ) .",

    "the coefficients of the equilibrium distribution expansion are determined by the conservation of mass and momentum , the property that galilean invariance holds , and an isotropic pressure tensor .    in this work",
    "we employ a pseudo four - dimensional lattice , which is the projection onto 3d of the d4q24 face - centered hypercubic ( fchc ) , single - speed lattice , where the notation implies the spatial dimension ( 4 ) and the number of vectors linking a site to its nearest neighbours ( 24 ) .",
    "the fchc lattice guarantees isotropic behaviour for the macrosopic momentum balance equation @xcite .    in the following subsections",
    "we introduce our modified shan - chen model , first by looking at a non - interacting mixture of gases , and second including the mean - field force term which gives rise to a non - ideal gas equation of state .",

    "this indicates that at the time steps immediately prior to the onset of the instability the lattice gets more and more populated with increasing speeds until in two or three time steps they grow by ten or more orders of magnitude . that the population of lattice sites with rapidly increasing speeds over time is small compared to the lattice volume can be concluded from contrasting the time variation in the standard error ( `` one sigma '' ) of @xmath164 to the time variation of @xmath164 , fig .",

    "we found that after a brief diffusional transient in which interconnected regions of fluid species embedded into one another are formed , the average size of such regions grows with time as @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "the trend is for the value to increase in the range @xmath2 as the reynolds number increases .",
    "this increase is consistent with a crossover from @xmath143 diffusive behaviour to hydrodynamic viscous growth @xmath144 predicted by the cahn - hilliard model h. owing to the significant amount of diffusion present at low reynolds number , we do not consider our results to be indicative of a genuinely hydrodynamic inertial @xmath169 regime .",
    "we observed exponential growth in the time dependence of the structure function for wavenumbers up to a threshold value , in qualitative agreement with predictions from the linearised cahn - hilliard model b. for small wavenumbers , such an exponential growth is seen at all simulation times , whereas it is only an initial transient for larger wavenumbers .",
    "these departures from model b predictions are for wavenumbers far from the one characterising the average domain size . a natural continuation of this work would be to investigate the nature of diffusion currents for these cases .",

    "@xcite conjectured that a @xmath11 behaviour , and a crossover to @xmath170 , could be caused by ( a ) lattice - gas noise , or ( b ) a poor scaling collapse , and that their @xmath169 domain growth , instead of @xmath94 , might be justified by the former .",
    "_ @xcite ascribed the @xmath11 behaviour and the crossover to not having reached the asymptotic limit , @xmath171 ( poor scaling collapse again ) .",
    "our noiseless model reproduced the @xmath9 crossover at @xmath7 and did not at @xmath10 , for which there is better scaling collapse , and also produced a 2/3 domain growth ( crossover ) exponent .",
    "all this leads us to conclude that noise may not play as important a role as the lack of scaling collapse in explaining the @xmath9 crossover , and is definitely not a requirement for the reproduction of a 2/3 domain growth exponent .",
    "a @xmath11 behaviour is the only one experimentally observed by kubota _",
    "@xcite for a mixture of isobutyric acid and water ; they cite surface tension effects , measurement difficulties , multiple light scattering , and even specificity to the mixture s molecular weight as reasons for not seeing a @xmath170 behaviour , and definitely discard thermal noise . not surprisingly , in his prediction yeung assumed a diffusive domain growth exponent of @xmath172 , which is rather seen in quenches of polymer mixtures and metal alloys .    in the case",
    "@xmath10 , the spectrum shows a @xmath173 behaviour in the small-@xmath8 limit , in disagreement with yeung s prediction .",
    "in fact , his analysis is based on a cahn - hilliard model without hydrodynamics .",
    "the numerical instabilities seen in our runs are caused by large speeds turning the equilibrium distribution negative for long enough to incur floating - point overflows .",
    "this happens for characteristic times ( _ cf .",
    "_ table [ parameters ] ) below @xmath174 , and the population of lattice sites undergoing such a burst in the fluid s macroscopic speed is small compared to the lattice volume .",

    ", whose macrodynamic behaviour for pure phases can not , by construction , be correctly described by our method .",
    "on the other hand , there is still scope to achieve reynolds numbers smaller than @xmath176 in search of the end of the crossover to @xmath3 .",
