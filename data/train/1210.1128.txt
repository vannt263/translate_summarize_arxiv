    "by studying isotopes with enhanced sensitivity to fundamental symmetries , nuclear physicists can test various aspects of the standard model in ways that are complementary to other sciences .",
    "for example , a possible explanation for the observed asymmetry between matter and anti - matter in the universe could be studied by searching for a permanent electric dipole moment larger than standard model predictions in heavy radioactive nuclei that have permanent octupole shapes .",
    "likewise , the superallowed @xmath0-decays of a handful of rare isotopes with similar numbers of protons and neutrons , in which both the parent and daughter nuclear states have zero angular momentum and positive parity , are the unique laboratory to study the strength of the weak force .",
    "what makes these pure vector - current - mediated ( fermi ) decays so useful for testing the standard model is the hypothesis of the conserved vector current ( cvc ) , that is , independence of the vector current on the nuclear medium .",
    "the consequence of the cvc hypothesis is that the product of the statistical rate function @xmath4 and partial half - life @xmath5 for the superallowed @xmath6 fermi @xmath0-decay should be nucleus independent and equal to : @xmath7 where @xmath8gev@xmath9s is a universal constant ; @xmath10 stands for the vector coupling constant for semi - leptonic weak interaction , and @xmath11 is the nuclear matrix element of the isospin rising or lowering operator @xmath12 .",
    "the relation ( [ ft ] ) does not hold exactly and must be slightly amended by introducing a set of radiative corrections to the @xmath13-values , and a correction to the nuclear matrix element due to isospin - symmetry breaking : @xmath14 with the left - hand side being nucleus independent . in eq .",
    "( [ ftnew ] ) , @xmath15% stands for the nucleus - independent part of the radiative correction  @xcite , @xmath16 is a transition - dependent ( @xmath17-dependent ) but nuclear - structure - independent part of the radiative correction  @xcite , and @xmath18 denotes the nuclear - structure - dependent part of the radiative correction  @xcite .    in spite of theoretical uncertainties in the evaluation of the radiative and isospin - symmetry - breaking corrections ,",
    "the superallowed @xmath0-decay is the most precise source of experimental information for determining the vector coupling constant @xmath10 , and provides us with a stringent test of the cvc hypothesis . in turn , it is also the most precise source of the matrix element @xmath19 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) three - generation quark mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "this is so because the leptonic coupling constant , @xmath20 gev@xmath21 , is well known from the muon decay  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the superallowed @xmath0-decay strategy results from the fact that , within the cvc hypothesis , @xmath22 can be extracted by averaging over several transitions in different nuclei . for precise tests of the standard model , only these transitions that have @xmath13-values known with a relative precision better than a fraction of a percent are acceptable . currently , 13  canonical \" transitions spreading over a wide range of nuclei from @xmath23 to @xmath24 meet this criterion ( have @xmath13-values measured with accuracy of order of 0.3% or better ) and are used to evaluate the values of @xmath10 and @xmath22  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on the isospin - breaking ( isb ) corrections @xmath25 , which were already computed by various authors , using a diverse set of nuclear models @xcite .",
    "the standard in this field has been set by towner and hardy ( ht )  @xcite who used the nuclear shell - model to account for the configuration mixing effect , and the mean - field ( mf ) approach to account for a radial mismatch of proton and neutron single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "wave functions caused by the coulomb polarization . in this study , which constitutes an extension of our earlier work @xcite , we use the isospin- and angular - momentum - projected density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "this method can account , in a rigorous quantum - mechanical way , for spontaneous symmetry - breaking ( ssb ) effects , configuration mixing , and long - range coulomb polarization effects .",

    "section [ sec06 ] studies a particular case of the fermi decay of @xmath28cl .",
    "finally , the summary and perspectives are given in sec .",
    "[ sec07 ] .",
    "the success of the self - consistent dft approach to mesoscopic systems  @xcite in general , and specifically to atomic nuclei  @xcite , has its roots in the ssb mechanism that incorporates essential short - range ( pairing ) and long - range ( spatial ) correlations within a single deformed slater determinant .",
    "the deformed states provide a basis for the symmetry - projected dft approaches , which aim at including beyond - mean - field correlations through the restoration of broken symmetries by means of projection techniques  @xcite .",
    "the building block of the isospin- and angular - momentum - projected dft approach employed in this study is the self - consistent deformed mf state @xmath29 that violates both the rotational and isospin symmetries . while the rotational invariance is of fundamental nature and is broken spontaneously , the isospin symmetry is violated both spontaneously and explicitly by the coulomb interaction between protons .",
    "the strategy is to restore the rotational invariance , remove the spurious isospin mixing caused by the isospin ssb effect , and retain only the physical isospin mixing due to the electrostatic interaction  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by a rediagonalization of the entire hamiltonian , consisting the isospin - invariant kinetic energy and skyrme force and the isospin - non - invariant coulomb force , in a basis that conserves both angular momentum and isospin .    to this end",
    ", we first find the self - consistent mf state @xmath29 and then build a normalized angular - momentum- and isospin - conserving basis @xmath30 by using the projection method : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 stand for the standard isospin and angular - momentum projection operators : @xmath34 where , @xmath35 is the rotation operator about the @xmath36-axis in the isospace , @xmath37 is the wigner function , and @xmath38 is the third component of the total isospin @xmath39 . as usual",
    ", @xmath40 is the three - dimensional rotation operator in space , @xmath41 are the euler angles , @xmath42 is the wigner function , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the angular - momentum components along the laboratory and intrinsic @xmath45-axis , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that unpaired mf states @xmath29 conserve the third isospin component @xmath46 ; hence , the one - dimensional isospin projection suffices .",
    "the set of states ( [ itbasis ] ) is , in general , overcomplete because the @xmath44 quantum number is not conserved .",
    "this difficulty is overcome by selecting first the subset of linearly independent states known as _ collective space _",
    "@xcite , which is spanned , for each @xmath47 and @xmath48 , by the so - called _ natural states _",
    "@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the entire hamiltonian  including the isb terms  is rediagonalized in the collective space , and the resulting eigenfunctions are : @xmath50 where the index @xmath51 labels the eigenstates in ascending order according to their energies .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath52 define the degree of isospin mixing through the so - called isospin - mixing coefficients ( or isospin impurities ) , determined for a given @xmath51th eigenstate as : @xmath53 where the sum of norms corresponds to the isospin @xmath48 dominating in the wave function @xmath54 .",
    "one of the advantages of the projected dft as compared to the shell - model - based approaches  @xcite is that it allows for a rigorous quantum - mechanical evaluation of the fermi matrix element using the bare isospin operators : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the rank - one covariant one - body spherical - tensor operators in the isospace , see the discussion in ref .",
    "indeed , noting that each @xmath57th eigenstate ( [ ktmix ] ) can be uniquely decomposed in terms of the original basis states ( [ itbasis ] ) , @xmath58 with microscopically determined mixing coefficients @xmath59 , the expression for the fermi matrix element between the parent state @xmath60 and daughter state @xmath61 can be written as :    @xmath62    where tilde indicates the slater determinant rotated in space : @xmath63 . the matrix element appearing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ mate ] ) can be expressed through the transition densities that are basic building blocks of the multi - reference dft  @xcite . indeed , with the aid of the identity @xmath64 which results from the general transformation rule for spherical tensors under rotations or isorotations , @xmath65 the matrix element entering eq .",
    "( [ mate ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath66 for unpaired slater determinants considered here , the double integral over the isospace euler angles in eq .",
    "( [ mate ] ) can be further reduced to a one - dimensional integral over the angle @xmath67 using the identity @xmath68 which is the one - dimensional version of the transformation rule ( [ trans ] ) valid for rotations around the @xmath69 axis in the isospace . the final expression for the matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ mate1 ] ) reads : @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the isovector transition density , and the double - tilde sign indicates that the right slater determinant used to calculate this density is rotated both in space as well as in isospace : @xmath72 . the symbol @xmath73 denotes the overlap kernel",
    ".    since the natural states have good isospin , the states ( [ ktmix ] ) are free from spurious isospin mixing .",
    "moreover , since the isospin projection is applied to self - consistent mf solutions , our model accounts for a subtle balance between the long - range coulomb polarization , which tends to make proton and neutron wave functions different , and the short - range nuclear attraction , which acts in an opposite way .",
    "the long - range polarization affects globally all s.p .",
    "wave functions .",
    "direct inclusion of this effect in open - shell heavy nuclei is possible essentially only within the dft , which is the only _ no - core _ microscopic framework that can be used there .",
    "recent experimental data on the isospin impurity deduced in @xmath74zr from the giant dipole resonance @xmath75-decay studies  @xcite agree well with the impurities calculated using isospin - projected dft based on modern skyrme - force parametrizations @xcite .",
    "this further demonstrates that the isospin - projected dft is capable of capturing the essential piece of physics associated with the isospin mixing .      as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the isospin projection technique outlined above does not yield singularities in energy kernels ; hence , it can be safely executed with all commonly used energy density functionals ( edfs ) .",
    "however , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the isospin projection alone leads to unphysically large isospin mixing in odd - odd @xmath76 nuclei .",
    "it has thus been concluded that  in order to obtain reasonable results ",
    "isospin projection must be augmented by angular - momentum projection .",
    "this not only increases the numerical effort , but also brings back the singularities in the energy kernels  @xcite and thus prevents one from using the modern parametrizations of the skyrme edfs , which all contain density - dependent terms @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only option @xcite is to use the hamiltonian - driven edfs . for the skyrme - type functionals ,",
    "this leaves us with one choice : the sv parametrization  @xcite . in order to better control the time - odd fields ,",
    "the standard sv parametrization must be augmented by the tensor terms , which were neglected in the original work  @xcite .",
    "this density - independent parameterization of the skyrme functional has the isoscalar effective mass as low as @xmath77 , which is required to reproduce the actual nuclear saturation properties .",
    "the unusual saturation mechanism of sv has a dramatic impact on the overall spectroscopic quality of this force , impairing such key properties like the symmetry energy  @xcite , level density , and level ordering .",
    "these deficiencies also affect the calculated isospin mixing , which is a prerequisite for realistic estimates of @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , in the case of @xmath74zr discussed above , sv yields @xmath78% , which is considerably smaller than the mean value of @xmath79% obtained by averaging over nine popular skyrme edfs including the msk1 , sko , skp , sly4 , sly5 , sly7 , skm@xmath80 , skxc , and siii functionals , see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "even though the isb corrections @xmath25 are primarily sensitive to _ differences _ between isospin mixing in isobaric analogue states , the lack of a reasonable hamiltonian - based skyrme edf is probably the most critical deficiency of the current formalism .",
    "the aim of this study is ( i ) to provide the most reliable set of the isb corrections that can be obtained within the current angular - momentum and isospin - projected single - reference dft , and ( ii ) explore the sensitivity of results to edf parameters , choice of particle - hole configurations , and structure of time - odd fields that correlate valence neutron - proton pairs in odd - odd @xmath76 nuclei . in particular , to quantify uncertainties related to the skyrme coupling constants , we have developed a new density - independent variant of the skyrme force dubbed hereafter shz2 , see table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the force was optimized purposefully to properties of light magic nuclei below @xmath81sn .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath82 , @xmath83,@xmath84,@xmath85 of shz2 were found by means of a @xmath86 minimization to experimental  @xcite binding energies of five doubly - magic nuclei : @xmath87o , @xmath88ca , @xmath89ca , @xmath90ni , and @xmath81sn .",
    "the procedure reduced the @xmath86 from @xmath91 for sv set to @xmath92 for shz2 .",
    "most of the nuclear matter characteristics calculated for both sets are similar .",
    "it appears , however , that the fit to light nuclei only weakly constrains the symmetry energy .",
    "the bulk symmetry energy of shz2 is @xmath93mev , i.e. , it overestimates the accepted value @xmath94mev by almost 30% . while this property essentially precludes using shz2 in detailed nuclear structure studies , it also creates an interesting opportunity for investigating the quenching of isb effects due to the large isospin - symmetry - restoring components of the force .",

    "whether or not the configuration - mixing calculations would provide a significant enhancement is an entirely open question .",
    "within the recently - developed unpaired projected - dft approach , we carried out systematic calculations of isospin mixing effects and isb corrections to the superallowed @xmath26 fermi decays in @xmath251 nuclei and @xmath0-transitions between the isobaric analogue states in mirror @xmath27 nuclei with @xmath252 .",

    "we also provide isb corrections for heavier nuclei with @xmath253 nuclei that can guide future experimental and theoretical studies .",

    ", we compared sv results with predictions of the new force shz2 that has been specifically developed for this purpose .",
    "the comparison of sv and shz2 results suggest that isb corrections are sensitive to the interplay between the bulk symmetry energy and time - odd mean - fields .",
    "while the overall agreement with the empirical values offered by the projected - dft approach is very encouraging , and the results are fairly robust , there is a lot of room for systematic improvements .",
    "the main disadvantages of our model in its present formulation include : ( i ) lack of pairing correlations ; ( ii ) lack of ph interaction ( or functional ) of good spectroscopic quality ; ( iii ) the use of a single hf reference state that can not accommodate configuration mixing effects ; ( iv ) ambiguities in establishing the hf reference state in odd and odd - odd nuclei caused by different possible orientations of time - odd currents with respect to total density distribution .",
