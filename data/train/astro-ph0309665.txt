    "thermonuclear ( type  ia ) supernovae ( sne  ia ) are believed to originate from the thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf composed of carbon and oxygen . in the favoured scenario ,",
    "the white dwarf accretes mass ( mostly hydrogen ) from a companion star in a binary .",
    "however , the identification of the progenitor type is by no means certain .",
    "alternative initial scenarios include the merging of two binary white dwarfs , or the accretion of helium @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that when the degenerate mass reaches the chandrasekhar limit ( 1.4 m@xmath10 ) , explosive carbon ignition occurs and burning to nuclear statistical equilibrium ensues , forming mostly radioactive @xmath11ni .",
    "intermediate - mass nuclei , e.g. @xmath12si , are produced in the outer , lower - density regions .",
    "these elements give rise to the typical observed spectra of sne  ia , which are dominated by lines of fe , si and s. nevertheless , the details of the explosion mechanism are still poorly understood .",
    "for example , it is not clear whether nuclear burning proceeds entirely in the form of a deflagration , or whether a subsequent transition to a detonation wave occurs .",
    "also , we do not understand fully what determines the mass of @xmath11ni produced , or if events producing the same @xmath11ni mass can differ in other respects . + it is vital that we improve our understanding of sne  ia both for the insight they can provide about astrophysical processes taking place under extreme conditions , and because of their use in the measurement of cosmological distances .",
    "observational studies of sne  ia at high redshifts ( @xmath13 ) are yielding increasingly strong evidence that we are living in a universe whose expansion began to accelerate at half its present age .",
    "this finding is commonly taken to indicate a finite positive cosmological constant @xmath14 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) i.e. a new form of energy with negative pressure @xcite .",
    "however , an important caveat is that these cosmological conclusions rely on the assumption that the physical properties of high  z sne  ia are the same as those seen locally . but given the uncertainties in the nature of local sne  ia , it is important to test the validity of this assumption . in order to address this fundamental question we must endeavour to improve our physical understanding of the sn  ia phenomenon .",
    "+ sn  ia theoretical models must be tested and constrained through comparison with observed light curves and spectral evolution . yet",
    "only for a few events has even moderate coverage been achieved , especially at infrared wavelengths . moreover , at all wavelengths there is a scarcity of observations during the 23 weeks when the sn is still brightening .",
    "data obtained during this time can be particularly effective in setting tight model constraints @xcite .",
    "a minority of sne  ia are obviously peculiar ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , although their significance for the overall picture is not clear . however ,",
    "even the so - called `` normal '' sne  ia display differences from one to another , e.g. in the photospheric expansion velocities deduced from the lines of the intermediate mass elements ( ime ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other more subtle differences in the photospheric spectra can also be seen .",
    "+ the desire to make decisive progress in accounting for the observed behaviour and diversity of sne  ia in terms of the explosion physics and the nature and evolution of the progenitor provided the motivation for the recently formed european supernova collaboration ( esc ) .",
    "this comprises a large consortium of european groups specialising in the observation and modelling of sne  ia .",
    "the consortium is partially funded as an eu research training network .",
    "the esc aims to elucidate the nature of sne  ia through the acquisition of high - quality photometry and spectra for 1012 nearby sne  ia .",

    "the high expansion velocity ( about 17,700 ) of the si  ii 6355   doublet was particularly indicative of an early epoch . in this paper",
    "we describe the results of our photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign for sn  2002bo , and compare the observed properties with those of a sample of branch - normal @xcite sne  ia .",
    "we also modelled two of the optical spectra , the earliest one and one very close to maximum , in order to derive some of the properties of the sn ejecta .",
    "we address the problem of determining the epoch of the spectra and in particular the reddening to the sn .",
    "we have also modelled our earliest ir spectrum both to address the amount of primordial carbon left in the sn ejecta and to identify the transitions present in this spectrum .",
    "spectroscopy and imaging were carried out at several sites using a number of different telescopes and/or instruments ( tables [ obs_tab ] & [ spec_tab ] ) .",
    "+      the ccd frames were first debiased and flat - fielded in the usual manner .",
    "since most of the data were obtained under non - photometric conditions , relative photometry was derived with respect to a local sequence of field stars ( see fig .",
    "the three photometric nights marked in table [ obs_tab ] ( plus one vlt+fors1 observation of sn  2002bo on march 3rd , 2003 ) were used to calibrate this sequence against landolt standard stars @xcite .",

    "in contrast , the other three sne  ia show a much weaker absorption , but with a greater multiplicity of small features .",
    "some of these differences may be due to higher velocities in sne  1984a and 2002bo , leading to a greater degree of line blending . in the 50006000  range , while the spectra of all five sne  ia become more similar to one another , we nevertheless note a somewhat larger amount of structure in sne 1990n , 1994d and 1998bu than in sne  1984a and 2002bo .",

    "the 40005000  region exhibits differences similar to those seen at earlier times , with a strong and relatively structureless emission feature at 4500  dominating the sne  1984a and 2002bo spectra , while the other three sne  ia show much weaker but more structured features . also , the siii 6355   absorption profiles continue to be broader and deeper in sne  1984a and 2002bo",

    "@xmath8(siii ) has a remarkably high value of 0.54 at an epoch of @xmath20d , but then undergoes a dramatic decline , levelling out just a few days before maximum at @xmath8(siii)=0.17 .",

    "sn  1984a also seems to follow this trend , although it does not fall to such a low value .",
    "the decrease of @xmath8(siii ) in sn  2002bo seems to track the increase of the photospheric temperature as indicated by the decrease of the @xmath21 colour ( see fig .",
    "[ col_fig ] ) at these epochs .",
    "+      up to + 5  days , siii 6355  provides one of the deepest absorption features . at the earliest epochs",
    "( see figure [ spec_evol ] ) , the profile is significantly asymmetric , owing in part to the presence of strong naid interstellar absorption and the smaller equivalent width of the siii feature at these early times .",
    "the minimum then shifts rapidly redwards and deepens with time as the photosphere moves into deeper , more slowly - moving material .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "the figure reveals clear differences between these events .",
    "sn  2002bo exibits an exceptionally high velocity which decreases in a smooth , gradual manner .",
    "a similar behaviour may be present in sn  1984a , although the data are more sparse . in contrast , sne 1990n , 1994d and 1998bu show significantly lower velocities , with a distinct break in the decline rate around @xmath22  days .",
    "the presence of a velocity break may be related to the fact that the velocity deduced from the siii 6355   absorption traces the photospheric velocity only during the era when the material near the photosphere is si - rich .",
    "later , the si absorption region becomes more detached from the photosphere leading to a velocity which changes more slowly with time @xcite .",
    "+    computed emergent pre - maximum spectra for a grid of snia atmospheres and argued that some of the differences between sne  ia events in the blueshift of the siii 6355  line at a given epoch may indicate a range of metallicities in the snia progenitor . in fig .",
    "[ siii ] we show the lentz model velocity predictions for metallicity values of @xmath231/3 , @xmath233 and @xmath2310 solar . while the behaviour of the lower velocity sne  ia is plausibly encompassed by a metallicity range @xmath231/3 to @xmath233 , a metallicity even as high as @xmath2310 solar fails to give velocities that are anywhere near those exhibited by sn  2002bo , not to mention the even faster sn  1984a .",
    "this suggests that the si observed in these spectra is mostly the product of sn nucleosynthesis , and that the outer layers of the ejecta of sn  2002bo do not preserve much memory of the properties of the progenitor , as also indicated by the absence of the cii lines discussed below .",
    "possible causes for this are discussed later .",
    "we have also examined the evolution of the sii 5640  absorption ( fig .",
    "[ vel]a ) .",
    "this is an interesting line to study since , as it is quite weak , we can be reasonably certain that it is always formed close to the continuum photosphere ( even allowing for possible siiii 5740  contamination at early times @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is a valuable probe of the true photospheric velocity .",
    "curiously , the pre - maximum velocity behaviour appears to divide our sample into two groups . in sn 2002bo , the sii velocity declines from a value of over 16,000  km / s at 13  days to about 10,000  km / s at maximum .",
    "a similar behaviour is observed in sn  1984a , where the velocity is even slightly higher , although here the data do not begin until about 7  days .",
    "in contrast , the other sne  ia reach only @xmath1912,500  km / s at 13 days , but they also decline to 10,000  km / s at maximum .",
    "this suggests rather different conditions in the outer envelopes of the two groups . between 0 and + 10  days ,",
    "sne  1990n , 1994d and 1998bu appear to show roughly the same decline rate in the velocity of the sii 5640line .",
    "coverage of sne  1984a and 2002bo is insufficient to reach definite conclusions about their decline rate in this period .",
    "actually , at phase + 8 days the sii doublet has already disappeared in the sn  1984a spectrum .",
    "the other very prominent absorption at early times is due to the caii h&k doublet . at a given epoch",
    "this has an even higher optical depth than siii 6355  and so the line forms further out in the ejecta , in higher velocity layers .",
    "consequently , the caii h&k minima exhibit higher velocity blueshifts than those seen in contemporary siii 6355  minima ( fig .",
    "[ vel]b ) . up to maximum light ,",

    "+      inspection of figure [ irspec_evol ] shows the earliest ir spectrum ( 8.5  days ) to be largely featureless .",
    "a weak , complex p - cygni line at about 10500   is apparent .",

    "the 10500   feature has vanished ( similar behaviour was seen in sn  1994d , @xcite ) , while two strong , wide ( fwhm @xmath24 ) emission features have appeared at 15490    and 17525 .",

    "+ figure [ ir ] shows the overall optical+ir spectral evolution of sn  2002bo .",

    "these collages have been used to determine the ir flux contribution for reconstructing the bolometric light curve ( see sect .",
    "[ red ] ) . for the earliest spectrum ,",
    "following de - reddening we find that the the total flux in the ir ( integrated between 10000 and 25000   ) is only 5% of the total optical flux ( integrated between 3500 and 10000  ) .",
    "for the second one , taken near the secondary maximum of the ir light curves , the ir contribution rises to 18% .",
    "for the later two spectra the ir contribution decreases to 6% of the optical .",

    "ia uvoir flux appears in the 3000 - 10000  window .      in order to interpret more deeply our observations , we have computed synthetic spectra for some of the available epochs .",
    "these models not only provide us with information about the physical properties of the sn ejecta , such as temperature , chemical composition , etc .",
    ", but also they can be used to verify observation - based estimates of parameters such as reddening , distance and epoch .",
    "we used a monte carlo code originally developed by to treat multi - line transfer in the expanding envelopes of hot stars .",
    "this code was further developed and adapted to sne by , , and .",
    "we briefly describe here the structure of the mc code .",
    "details can be obtained from the references given above .",
    "the code uses as input a model of the explosion ( density v. velocity ) , the emergent luminosity @xmath26 , the epoch @xmath27 ( time since explosion ) , the estimated velocity of the photosphere @xmath28 and a set of abundances .",
    "these are treated as homogeneous above the momentary photosphere .",
    "the code divides the sn envelope into a number of shells , with the thickness of each shell increasing as a function of radius .",
    "velocity is a continuous function of radius .",
    "for sn ejecta we may assume homologous expansion , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radius and @xmath27 the time since the explosion .",
    "density is rescaled according to the epoch .",
    "the temperature in the various shells is computed assuming radiative equilibrium . at a given epoch ,",
    "temperature and density are treated as constant in each shell .",
    "the sobolev approximation is adopted .",
    "another basic assumption is that all the radioactive decay and fast - electron energy is deposited below a sharply - defined radius , the `` photosphere '' ( schuster - schwarzschild approximation ) .",
    "this energy is distributed equally among packets , which represent `` collective photons '' .",
    "these packets are characterised by a specific frequency , and their distribution with frequency represents the temperature at the photosphere .",
    "the packets propagate through the envelope ( i.e. the ejecta above the photosphere ) where they interact with electrons and atoms .",
    "interaction with electrons is treated as scattering , while if a packet is absorbed by a line it is re - emitted in one of the allowed downward transitions .",
    "this is selected randomly , but weighted in proportion to the effective downward ( @xmath31 ) rate of each transition .",
    "the packet is assigned the new frequency and a random direction and the mc procedure continues until the packet either escapes the ejecta or is absorbed back in the photosphere .",
    "finally , the emergent spectrum is computed using the formal integral @xcite .",
    "+    here , we present and discuss synthetic spectra for two epochs . in view of the somewhat unusual properties of sn  2002bo ( e.g. the high velocity of several lines at early epochs ) , we computed models for the earliest spectrum ( epoch @xmath32  days ) to determine whether or not the outer abundances are peculiar .",
    "we also computed models for a spectrum observed near maximum light in order to check the consistency of our results .",
    "the density structure and initial abundances were taken from the w7 model @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the w7 model , the composition is assumed to be uniform above the momentary photosphere .",
    "this is done by taking the w7 abundance at the velocity of the momentary photosphere and assuming that this is constant throughout the outer ejecta .",
    "this procedure is repeated for each epoch independently of the previous ones .",
    "an updated version of the code implementing the full stratified abundance distribution is in preparation . keeping the density structure unchanged , the abundances",
    "were then adjusted to improve the model match to the data .",
    "+    we consider first the earliest spectrum ( 13  days ) .",
    "as indicated above , we started with a w7-like abundance distribution .",
    "for the envelope at this epoch , the w7 abundance is dominated by oxygen ( mass fraction of 65% ) and a rather small contribution of carbon ( 7% ) .",
    "ime are represented by magnesium ( 8% ) , silicon ( 10% ) , sulphur ( 2% ) and calcium ( 2% ) .",
    "iron group elements ( titanium and chromium 0.5% each , 2% of iron , 2% of nickel and 1% of cobalt ) complete the initial abundance set . note that in order to reproduce observed features an fe abundance is adopted that is higher than the the w7 value .",
    "this is also higher than what  decay would allow , indicating that a significant quantity of fe is left over from the progenitor .",
    "a grid of models were then computed in which radius of the `` photosphere '' , emergent luminosity , abundance distribution , epoch and reddening were adjusted within a reasonable range to optimise the match to the observed 12.9  day spectrum .",
    "each cell of the grid consists of a fixed epoch and reddening whilst the remaining parameters are consequently set to optimise the fit to the data .",
    "although we could have included distance as one of the parameters of the grid , we chose to concentrate on a two parameter space to simplify our calculations .",
    "we therefore adopted a distance modulus @xmath33 , as given by the observations ( section [ red ] ) .",
    "spectra taken at the beginning of the rise of a sn are very useful to determine the correct epoch since luminosity changes significantly in this period .",
    "the position of the photosphere in velocity space can be determined fairly accurately by the position of the absorptions .",
    "therefore , a change in the assumed epoch translates almost directly into a change of the photospheric radius ( @xmath34 ) , which influences strongly the overall temperature structure and therefore the line depths and the ionization structure .",
    "the epoch was varied between 4 and 7 days post - explosion , and the reddening @xmath35 between 0.00 and 0.45 .",
    "velocity and luminosity were adjusted to fit the overall flux level and the position of the absorptions .",
    "the best match spectrum is shown in figure [ min12_9 ] .",
    "the corresponding free parameter values obtained are : photospheric radius @xmath36  cm ( corresponding to @xmath37  ) , log bolometric luminosity @xmath38  [ ] , epoch = @xmath39 days post - explosion , @xmath40 and a total mass of the envelope of @xmath41  m@xmath10 .",
    "the abundance distribution is discussed below . from this",
    "we deduce that the maximum - light spectrum corresponds to an epoch of @xmath42 days post - explosion , indicating a risetime in @xmath0 of the same value . with a higher reddening of @xmath43 , the best ( but poorer ) match ( see fig .",
    "[ min12_9 ] ) was achieved with radius @xmath44  cm ( @xmath45  ) , @xmath46  [ ] at an epoch of @xmath47 days post - explosion , implying a value of @xmath48 days for the epoch of the maximum - light spectrum and the rise time .",
    "the abundance distribution is discussed below .",
    "this higher - reddening match yields a luminosity which is closer to the value of @xmath49  [ ] inferred from fig .",
    "[ bolo ] for this epoch , which could be expected , since the uvoir luminosity in fig 4 was derived using the larger reddening .",
    "if a smaller reddening was assumed , the sn luminosity would obviously be smaller , and comparable to that obtained from the low - reddening models here .",
    "while the overall best match was obtained with @xmath50 , plausible matches were also obtainable with smaller reddening .",
    "however , since the photometry and naid absorption indicate a higher value viz .",
    "@xmath51 , we conservatively adopt @xmath52 , and consider models with both @xmath43 and 0.30 .",
    "+ the radiation temperature at the photosphere @xmath53 is found after six iterations determining the temperature structure in the envelope and counts for the `` backwarming '' effect , i.e. photons are scattered back into the photosphere and heat it up . the values are @xmath54  k for the low - reddening model and @xmath55  k for the high - reddening model .",
    "since in this temperature region there are ionisation edges of some elements like si and s , this difference in temperature affects the ionization structure and consequently the emergent spectra are significantly different . in the low - reddening case ,",
    "the ca abundance was reduced to 1/4 of its initial value while , for the high - reddening case , it was reduced to 1/10 .",
    "all abundances of the iron group elements are significantly lower than in w7 ( @xmath56% of the initial values ) , but the high - reddening model requires a higher fe - group abundance in order to reproduce the observed strength of the feii lines .",
    "this is due to the higher temperature in this model , which leads to a lower fraction of feii .",
    "the overall reduction of most elements caused an increased oxygen abundance ( @xmath57% ) .",
    "we now consider in detail the model matches to the early ( 13  d ) spectrum ( figure [ min12_9 ] ) , and examine some of the more prominent features .",
    "shortward of @xmath196500    both models reproduce the main features of the data quite well .",
    "starting at the bluest part of the spectrum , the need for a higher temperature in the high - reddening model is partly driven by the requirement to reproduce the total flux in this region .",
    "however this , in turn , tends to increase the ratio of doubly- to singly - ionised species .",
    "consequently , to reproduce the deep mgii 4481    absorbtion at 4300   , a higher mg abundance is required in the high - reddening model .",
    "a similar argument is relevant to the deep , broad absorption feature at @xmath194800   , produced mostly by feii lines . in the high - reddening model",
    "this requires an fe abundance of 0.02 in the envelope , but in the low - reddening model this falls to 0.015 .",
    "we conclude that higher abundances of mg and fe are required in the high - reddening model .",
    "in contrast , to reproduce the deep absorption feature at @xmath195350   , attributed to sii 5640   , we need a somewhat higher s abundance in the _ low_-reddening model ( 0.05 compared to 0.03 ) . we ascribe this to a larger proportion of s recombining to the neutral state at this lower temperature compared with the high - reddening model . when we consider si , a difficulty for the high - reddening model become apparent . in this model",
    "most of the si is ionized to si@xmath58 , making it impossible to reproduce the full depth of the 5650  absorption , attributed to the siii 5972    line .",
    "the low - reddening model is able to reproduce the absorption features due to siii 5972   , 6355   , by invoking a relative si abundance of 0.12 ( mass fraction ) at high velocities ( @xmath59  ) .",
    "w7 predicts no si at such high velocities from which we may infer that extensive mixing has taken place .",
    "however , accepting this , we might also expect to see evidence of oxygen mixed downward to low velocities . that this is not observed in the later",
    "spectra perhaps suggests that o was at least partially burned to si even in the outer layers .    at longer wavelengths ,",
    "both models produce a large excess of flux .",
    "this is due to the limitation of the schuster - schwarzschild approximation which is used in the code . in the red / infrared part of the spectrum , where line opacity is low , the photosphere actually lies at a greater depth than is estimated in the code , and consequently the model overestimates the flux .",
    "nevertheless , we have carried out a comparison of model spectra with the observations in the infrared region .",
    "unfortunately there are no infrared observations available at day 12.9 , when the spectral model is more applicable at such long wavelengths .",
    "the earliest ir - spectrum is from day 8.5 .",
    "therefore , in order to examine the 800025,000    region , we scaled the flux of the 12.9d low - reddening model by @xmath60 to bring it to the flux level of the observed spectrum from day 8.5 .",
    "the ir spectrum is shown in figure [ ir_model ] , together with the model spectra for two values of the carbon abundance ( see below ) .",
    "in general there is reasonable agreement between the models and the observations with respect to the overall shape of the ir spectra . in the 800013000    window",
    "we identify features due to the mgii 9217,9243    doublet and the 10914,10915,10952    triplet .",
    "additionally there is a siii feature of minor importance at 9413   . in the 15,00018,000    window",
    "we attribute the broad absorption at 16,000    in the figure to a blend of siii 16,906   , 16,977   , 17,183    and mgii 16,760   , 16,800   , with the siii feature dominating .",
    "thus , at this early epoch we confirm the ir identifications proposed by for their spectra of other type ia supernovae .",
    "point out that the mg  ii ir features are valuable for placing limits on the mass of unburned material .",
    "we shall address this issue in a later paper .",
    "in the 20,000 - 25,000  region line no strong features were observed in the spectrum nor predicted by the model .",
    "there is only a shallow , broad p - cygni feature at @xmath1920800  which we attribute to siii .",
    "did not cover this spectral region .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the red / infrared part of the spectrum will be accomplished in an upcoming paper using an improved version of the code .",
    "+ one reason that early - time spectra are of particular interest is because , via the strength of cii lines in the red part of the spectrum , they can provide interesting limits on the amount of carbon present , and how far into the outer layers the burning penetrated .",
    "the carbon abundance at extremely early times may even reveal the properties of the progenitor white dwarf .",
    "fisher et al . (",
    "1997 ) suggested that the entire ` siii ' 6150    absorption feature in the 14  d spectrum of sn  1990n was actually cii 6578,83    at high velocity .",
    "however , mazzali ( 2001 ) showed that this line could , at most , be responsible for only the red side of the 6150    feature , as indicated by its presence as a weak absorption at lower velocities sitting on top of the p - cygni emission of the siii line , and by the weakness of the corresponding cii  7231,36    line . identified absorption features due to cii  6578,83    and cii  7231,36    in the @xmath61  d spectrum of sn  1998aq .",
    "they are also clearly visible in the @xmath62  d spectrum of sn  1994d ( @xcite , @xcite ) , although by @xmath63  d they had almost disappeared ( see fig .",
    "[ premax ] ) .",
    "however , in sn  2002bo there is no trace of these features , even in the earliest spectra . in order to place limits on the abundance of high velocity c implied by this negative observation",
    ", we increased the 7% carbon relative abundance specified by w7 , to 40% throughout the envelope .",
    "this produced very strong cii  6578,83    features which were not present in the observed spectrum .",
    "we then decreased the carbon abundance until the cii  6578,83    features became fully undetectable in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "this occurred for a c abundance of 3% .",
    "as a check , we extended the modelling to 25,000    where ci and cii lines are found in the model s line list .",
    "these include multiplets around 9,100   , 10,680   , 11,750   , 14,400  and 21,200    plus several single lines distributed throughout the 800025,000    region .",
    "figure [ ir_model ] shows the ir spectrum plus the 40% carbon and 3% carbon models .",
    "it can be seen that , even with a 40% carbon abundance , the carbon features are barely discernable .",
    "however , the observed spectrum shows no sign whatever of the predicted carbon features confirming that the carbon abundance is less than 40% .",
    "reducing the carbon abundance to 3% causes the lines in the 800025,000    region to become too weak or too blended with other lines ( mostly siii or mgii ) to be detectable .",
    "we conclude that the ir spectrum is consistent with a 3% carbon abundance , although the actual limit here is less stringent than in the optical region .",
    "we note that , aside from the low abundance , the weakness of the ci lines is due to the temperature of the sn ejecta which leads to an almost completely ionization to cii .",
    "the low carbon abundance is discussed in the next section .",
    "we turn now to the optical spectrum taken close to maximum light ( fig .",
    "[ 0_1 ] ) . by this epoch",
    "the photospheric radius has increased to @xmath64  cm ( corresponding to @xmath65  ) in the low reddening model , and @xmath66  cm ( corresponding to @xmath67  ) in the high reddening model .",
    "the photospheric luminosities are 43.03  [ ] and 43.27  [ ] respectively .",
    "once again the high - reddening model attains a higher radiation temperature ( @xmath68  k ) compared with the low - reddening model ( @xmath69  k ) .",
    "note that the temperature of the spectrum near peak brightness is hotter than at 13 days .",
    "such behaviour was also observed in sn  1990n ( mazzali et al .",
    "1993 ) , one of the few other sne  ia with very early spectral coverage .",
    "it is probably due to the fact that the heating coming from the delayed release of radiation , still overcomes the expansion cooling of the envelope .",
    "both models have a problem in reproducing the 43004500  absorption , which is dominated by siii lines . to reproduce the depth of the absorption ,",
    "we need a high si abundance ( 62.1% for the higher reddening model and 66.7% for the lower reddening one , respectively ) indicating that the part of the ejecta with velocities near 10,000  is dominated by ime . as with the high - reddening model at the earlier epoch ,",
    "the need for such a high abundance is driven by the fact that almost all the si is doubly - ionised in the model .",
    "we also note that both models produce a double structure in the trough , with the high - reddening case being more pronounced .",
    "curiously , while this structure is absent from sn  2002bo , it is present in sne 1994d and 1998bu ( fig .",
    "[ max ] ) .",
    "the persistence of a weak absorption due to siiii 4567    in the model suggests that @xmath35 could be even smaller than 0.30 .",
    "the high ionisation also results in the absorption of the siii 6355    line being slightly too shallow .",
    "however , most striking is the fact that the siii 5958    absorption , while well reproduced in the low - reddening model is completely absent in the high reddening one .    as with the early - epoch spectrum ,",
    "both models overproduce the flux longward of @xmath196500   , with the high - reddening model being the most discrepant .",
    "the observed absorption at 7500    might be identifiable as oi  7771   .",
    "( note that the narrower 7600    feature is the residual of the telluric absorption . ) however , even with an unphysically high o abundance we can not reproduce the depth of this feature since the high temperature ionises all the neutral oxygen . the modelled caii absorption at @xmath193750    due to the 3933,68  h&k doublet matches the observation very well , but the absorption at @xmath198200    due to the @xmath198500    ir  triplet is too weak even after taking into account the offset between the spectral model and the observed continuum .",
    "once again the match is somewhat better in the low - reddening model . in general",
    ", we find that the difficulties encountered by the high - reddening model are even larger at this epoch .",
    "we conclude that modelling of both epochs suggests a reddening value smaller than the e@xmath70 derived from the lira and naid relations .",
    "this is indicated by the line ratios , line depths , overall shape of the spectra and the model abundances .",
    "although distance was not included in our grid calculation , we computed some test models with high reddening and various distances for the 12.9  d spectrum .",
    "relevant parameters are very sensitive to small changes at these early epoch @xcite .",
    "we find that reasonable results can be obtained for a higher reddening , but this requires using a significantly shorter distance ( @xmath71 ) . in order to keep a temperature similar to the low reddening model we need to use the same luminosity .",
    "this leads to a bolometric luminosity at maximum light of 43.00  [ ] , similar to the luminosity of the low reddening model ( 43.03  [ ] ) .",
    "so the model - derived luminosity is in any case lower than the value 43.19  [ ] suggested by the observations ( section [ red ] ) .",
    "the spectral model - derived explosion epoch of @xmath72 days is consistent with the rise - time derived from our photometry using the procedure , and with the average value for sne  ia given by riess et al .",
    "it may be that some of the difficulties encountered with the model results presented here arise from the artificial homogenisation of the element distribution in the envelope .",
    "the distribution of the elements throughout the ejecta will be addressed in a separate analysis using an improved version of the mc code , including abundance stratification .",
    "we have presented optical / near - infrared photometry and spectra of the type  ia sn  2002bo spanning epochs from 13  days before maximum @xmath0-band light to + 102  days after .",
    "the pre - maximum optical coverage is particularly complete .",
    "the extinction deduced from the observed colour evolution and from interstellar naid absorption is quite high viz .",
    "e@xmath1 . on the other hand , model matches to the observed spectra point to a lower reddening ( e@xmath2 ) .",
    "we have been unable to resolve this reddening dichotomy .",
    "however , the esc has monitored another supernova , sn  2002dj .",
    "this event exhibits photometric and spectroscopic similarities to sn  2002bo , but suffers from much less interstellar extinction .",
    "modelling of the spectra of sn  2002dj ( pignata et al , in preparation ) may help to establish the true extinction to sn  2002bo .    in some respects ,",
    "sn  2002bo behaves as a typical `` branch normal '' type  ia supernova ( sn  ia ) at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "we find a @xmath0-band risetime of 17.9@xmath30.5  days , a @xmath4(b ) of @xmath5 , a de - reddened @xmath6 , and a bolometric maximum of @xmath73 .",
    "however , comparison with other type  ia supernovae having similar @xmath4(b ) values indicates that in other respects , sn  2002bo is unusual .",
    "the evolution of the sn  2002bo @xmath21 and @xmath74 colours shows some differences from that seen in sne  1994d , 1998bu , 2001el ( see fig .",
    "[ col_fig ] ) .",
    "moreover , while the optical spectra of sn  2002bo are very similar to those of sn  1984a ( which has a similar @xmath4(b ) = 1.19 ) , lower velocities and a generally more structured appearance are found in sne  1990n , 1994d and 1998bu ( see also hatano et al .",
    "2000 ) , whose values of @xmath9(b ) are only slightly smaller ( sne 1990n and 1998bu ) or slightly larger ( sn  1994d ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath8(siii ) for sn  2002bo is strikingly different from that shown by other type  ia supernovae .",
    "the sn  2002bo spectra demonstrate the existence of s at @xmath75  km / s , si at @xmath76  km / s and ca at @xmath77  km / s . while small amounts of primordial abundances may be present",
    ", this can not explain the strength of the high velocity ime spectral features .",
    "moreover , modelling of the siii 5972 , 6355  lines confirms the presence of si at velocities higher than that predicted by w7 .",
    "we conclude that the behaviour of sn  2002bo can not be easily related to a single parameter description of the properties of sne  ia ( see also @xcite ) .    the presence of high - velocity ime ( si , s , ca ) in sn  2002bo ( and sn  1984a ) may be interpreted in various ways .",
    "one possibility is that the explosion that became sn  2002bo was more energetic than that of the average sn  ia , thus setting material in motion at higher velocities . given that the velocities in sne  2002bo and 1984a are about 20% higher than in normal sne  ia , the kinetic energy of the explosion would have to be about 44% larger .",
    "however , these high velocities are shown only by the ime . in the iron - group layers the fe nebular lines have velocities comparable to those of normal sne  ia , although lying to the higher velocity side of the distribution .",
    "therefore , the physical difference between sn  2002bo and more normal sne may not be so great . in support of this view",
    ", we note that most of the kinetic energy is produced by burning to si , while the remaining burning stages to nse make a further , but minor contribution .",
    "therefore one may imagine a situation where burning to ime continues further out into the outermost layers in sne 2002bo and 1984a than in other sne  ia .",
    "this enhanced burning may point to some form of delayed detonation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario has some useful consequences .",
    "since the ime are produced at high velocities , but at the same time no more @xmath11ni is produced than in other sne  ia , then this would only have a small effect on @xmath4 , since the shape of the light curve depends mostly on the behaviour of the line opacity , which is dominated by fe - group elements ( mazzali et al . 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , the amount of progenitor material ( c , o ) observed in the outer layers of the sn would be greatly reduced . in particular ,",
    "if burning proceeded at a relatively low density , c , but not o , would be burned to ime thus explaining the unusually low abundance of carbon at the highest velocities .",
    "it may be that the 13  day photosphere happened to fall at the location where c but not o had been burned to ime .",
    "this layer has a small velocity extent , and its location depends on the overall properties of the explosion ( it is located further out the more  was synthesized , see e.g. iwamoto et al . ,",
    "it is therefore possible that the original , high c abundance might still exist in layers well above the photosphere of the 13  day spectrum , although those layers may have densities too low for c lines to be strong once the photosphere has receded to deeper layers .",
    "furthermore , this picture may explain the cool early - time temperatures indicated both by the pre - maximum si ii line ratio and by the siiii 4553 , 4568  feature ( see sect.[syn ] ) .",
    "if si extends to higher levels than normal , to velocities where unburned material is usually found , then such si would be subject to a much - reduced @xmath78-ray / fast - electron flux and its temperature would be lower than in the si layer of more typical sne  ia",
    ". there would be a number of observable consequences of this situation : 1 ) at very early times , the si lines would be stronger than in other sne , and would extend to higher velocities , 2 ) also at very early times , the si line ratio would indicate a lower temperature than in other sne , because the si that contributes to the lines is located further from the @xmath11ni , and 3 ) as time goes by it might be expected that the si line ratio would evolve towards higher temperatures , as confirmed in figure 9",
    ".    the above scenario will be more severely tested by spectral models which include abundance stratification , and by the acquisition of even earlier spectra .",
    "extremely early observations may even place constraints on the progenitor composition .",
    "in addition , the reason for such behaviour will be explored via detailed 3d studies of the explosion , which are currently under way .",
    "+ other possible explanations exist for the atypical behaviour of sne  2002bo and 1984a . for example , the ime produced at deeper layers may be more efficiently mixed upwards in sne 2002bo and 1984a than in other sne  ia .",
    "this may provide an equally plausible explanation for all the characteristics discussed above .",
    "one way to discriminate between the two possibilities is to look for c and o at lower velocities - if ime have been mixed out , c and o should have been mixed in . +",
    "a somewhat more exotic scenario is that sne  2002bo and 1984a came from more massive progenitors , such as might be produced by a binary white - dwarf merger . in this case , however , one might expect that not only would more ime be produced at higher velocities , but also that more @xmath11ni would be synthesised .",
    "this scenario would lead not only to broad fe nebular lines in the late - time spectrum , but also to a brighter sn @xcite , something that does not seem to be the case here .",
    "the nebular lines in the late - time spectrum of sn  2002bo have widths comparable to those of other typical snia .      we thank k. krisciunas and n. suntzeff for providing us with their @xmath79 photometry of sn  2002bo prior to publication .",
