    "the study of chemical abundances and their distribution across the disk of galaxies provides essential information to understand the nuclear processes in stellar interiors and the chemical evolution and formation of galaxies .",
    "the main aim of this work is to determine and analyse @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 radial abundances gradients using optical recombinations lines ( orls ) from deep hii regions spectra in nearby galaxies .",
    "we pay special attention to carbon ( c ) because it is the second most abundant heavy - element in the universe and is of paramount biogenic importance . unfortunately ,",
    "despite its importance , there are few studies about c abundances in extragalactic hii regions and mainly derived from uv collisionally excited lines , which are extremely sensitive to precise determinations of extinction and electron temperature of the nebula .",
    "we selected seven hii regions of ngc300 from the samples of @xcite and @xcite , according to their high surface brightness and position along the disk of the galaxy .",
    "these regions were observed at cerro paranal observatory using ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the vlt in service time between 2010 july and august .",
    "we covered the whole optical spectral range and integrated 1.75 h on each region , with a slit width of 3@xmath6 . in this work we also present additional deep spectrophotometric data of hii regions from previous studies by our group of the milky way and other nearby spiral galaxies : m31 , m101 , m33 and ngc2403 .",
    "these data were taken with some of the largest aperture telescopes available : vlt , keck and subaru telescopes .",
    "to measure the line fluxes we used the splot routine of iraf .",
    "we integrated all the flux in the line between two given limits and over a local continuum estimated by eye . in case of line blending , we fitted a double gaussian profile to measure the individual line intensities .",
    "all line fluxes were normalized to @xmath7 and corrected for interstellar reddening .",
    "the identification and laboratory wavelength of the lines were obtained following the previous works of @xcite and @xcite    the c  @xmath84267 line and some lines of multiplet 1 of o  around @xmath84649 were detected in 4 regions .",

    "the physical conditions of the ionized gas , electron density and temperature , were derived using pyneb , a python - based and updated expansion of the package ( @xcite ) .",
    "electron density , @xmath10 was derived from [ s ]  6731/6716 , [ o ]  3726/3729 and [ cl ]  5538/5518 lines ratios .",
    "electron temperature , @xmath11 was derived from [ o ]  4363/5007 , [ s ]  6312/9069 , [ n ]  5755/6584 , [ o ]  ( 7320 + 30)/(3726 + 29 ) and [ s ]  ( 4068 + 76)/(6717 + 31 ) lines ratios .",
    "we assumed a two - zone scheme , where the high ionization zone is characterized by a @xmath11 that is the weighted mean of t@xmath12([o ] ) and t@xmath12([s ] ) whereas for the low - ionization zone , we computed @xmath11 as the weighted mean of t@xmath12([n ] ) and t@xmath12([o ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the temperatures were computed through monte carlo simulations .",

    "this lines are much brighter than orls , and therefore easier to detect .",
    "however , abundances relative to hydrogen derived from cels are strongly affected by uncertainties in the electron temperature . on the other hand , abundances derived from orls",
    "are almost independent on the physical conditions , but in extragalactic hii regions these lines are extremely difficult to observe .",
    "we derived @xmath4 ratios for each hii region using both cels and orls ( when available ) .",
    "@xmath3 ratios can only be obtained from orls and , for consistency @xmath5 ratios were computed also from orls . to compute total o / h ratio from cels , we simply added o@xmath13 and o@xmath14 abundances . for orls , where we could not compute o@xmath13 from these kind of lines , we assumed the @xmath15 ratio determined from cels to obtain the final o / h ratio . to take into account for the unseen ionization stages of c",
    ", we used the ionization correction factor ( icf ) proposed by @xcite to compute the total c abundance . in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] we compare the galactic radial @xmath4 gradients obtained using cels and orls .",
    "the o abundances based on orls are systematically higher than those derived from cels .",

    "moreover , there seems to be a correlation between steeper gradients and the luminosity ( mass ) of the spiral galaxy .",
