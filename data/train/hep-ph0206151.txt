    "<S> the heidelberg dark matter search ( hdms ) is an experiment designed for the search for wimp dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is using a special configuration of ge detectors , to efficiently reduce the background in the low - energy region below 100 kev . </S>",
    "<S> after one year of running the hdms detector prototype in the gran sasso underground laboratory , the inner crystal of the detector has been replaced with a hpge crystal of enriched @xmath0ge . </S>",
    "<S> the final setup started data taking in gran sasso in august 2000 . </S>",
    "<S> the performance and the first results of the measurement with the final setup are discussed .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the individual typical duration of a run was about 23 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was stopped daily and the most important detector parameters like leakage current and mean count rates were checked . </S>",
    "<S> no substantial fluctuations were recorded .    </S>",
    "<S> after the individual runs were calibrated and corrected for the crosstalk , they were added to provide the sum spectra . from the sum spectrum of the inner detector ( after the anti - coincidence cut ) </S>",
    "<S> the limits on wimp dark matter can be extracted .    </S>",
    "<S> although the statistics of the inner detector is low , the sum - spectrum ( see fig . [ hdmsspecsfull ] ) show some lines of isotopes from the u / th natural decay chains as well as some x - ray lines which are dominating the region below 10kev(see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ specilow ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious structure in the low energy region is a peak at 10.37  kev resulting from the decay of @xmath1ge and a peak around 9  kev , which could arise from @xmath2zn . </S>",
    "<S> note that for the low energy region ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ specilow ] ) there are no more indications for a contamination with @xmath3pb in comparison with the results from the prototype - detector @xcite . also the structure at 32.5  kev , which is meanwhile understood ( see @xcite ) , vanished completely .    </S>",
    "<S> if the anti - coincidence is evaluated in the energy region between 50kev and 100kev , the background reduction factor is 4.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the counting rate after the anti - coincidence in this energy region is 0.27events/(kgdkev ) ( from february 2001 ) , thus comparable to the value measured in the heidelberg - moscow experiment with the enriched detector ang2 @xcite . in the energy region between 11kev and 40kev </S>",
    "<S> the background index is 0.43events/(kgdkev . ) .      </S>",
    "<S> since many cosmogenic isotopes have half - lifes below 300 days , typically the count rate in low - level detectors decreases considerably after one year of storage underground .    </S>",
    "<S> for this reason only the last 132.4 days , corresponding to 26.74 kg d of measurement for the inner detector were used for the evaluation of the final hdms setup data . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure of extracting limits on wimp dark matter from the obtained spectrum follows the method described in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting upper limit is shown in the exclusion plot in figure [ hdmsproto ] . </S>",
    "<S> already now the limit given by the hdms experiment is slightly better in the low energy range than the limit given by the for low wimp masses . </S>",
    "<S> this due to the fact that the energy threshold of 5  kev has been obtained for this measurement ( compare to 9  kev threshold of the   @xcite ) . </S>"
