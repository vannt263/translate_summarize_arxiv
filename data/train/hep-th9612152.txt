    "the two dimensional gauge field theories on a manifold and in particular on riemann surfaces have recently been considered by various authors @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the abelian case is particularly interesting because of the presence of topologically nontrivial sectors labelled by the nonzero values of the first chern class @xcite .",
    "the problem of deriving topologically nontrivial solutions of the maxwell equations on a manifold is relevant in string theories @xcite , in quantum mechanics @xcite and in the theory of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "the classical solutions of the maxwell equations on riemann surfaces have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for particular metrics and in ref .",
    "@xcite for conformally flat metrics .",
    "more recently , the results of @xcite have been generalized to any metric in @xcite . in the works mentioned above the gauge field configurations corresponding to nonvanishing values of the first chern class",
    "have been expressed in terms of the prime form and theta functions @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use instead an alternative approach , which has already provided physically relevant results in string theory for its explicitness @xcite , @xcite .",
    "namely , the riemann surface will be represented here as an @xmath2sheeted covering of the complex sphere , i. e. as an affine algebraic curve @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this representation is that any differential equation defined on a riemann surface , such as those arising for instance in quantum field theory or quantum mechanics , becomes a differential equation on the sphere .",
    "a second advantage is that , at least in the case of algebraic curves with @xmath0 symmetry group of automorphisms , the dependence on the moduli is explicit .",
    "the latter are in fact given by the branch points and enter in the equation of the curve as simple complex parameters . despite of these advantages , the analytic solution of the physically relevant field or wave equations is very difficult on an algebraic curve because of the presence of multivalued differential operators . until now",
    ", only the theory of the socalled @xmath3 systems has been fully solved on any algebraic curve using the operator formalism of refs .",
    "the maxwell field theory is more complicated than the @xmath3 systems because it is not conformally invariant and the metric is present in the equations of motion .",
    "unfortunately , on an algebraic curve the powerful tools offered by the theory of theta functions and exploited for instance in refs . @xcite and @xcite , are not very helpful for computational purposes .",
    "for instance , the already existing formulas of the prime form @xcite are somewhat cumbersome and unexplicit for physical applications .",
    "+ despite of these problems , we will derive in this paper all the nontrivial classical solutions of the maxwell equations at least in the case of the @xmath0 symmetric curves .",
    "this is an important class of curves , which covers the entire moduli space spanned by the riemann surfaces of genus @xmath1 .",
    "we will see that the topologically nontrivial gauge fields obtained here have a relatively simple expression , similar to their analogues on the complex sphere and thus can provide new insights in two dimensional quantum mechanics and fqhe on a manifold .",
    "moreover , we derive a big family of tensors describing nondegenerate metrics on the @xmath0 symmetric curves .",
    "this allows to write explicitly in terms of multivalued differential operators on the sphere not only the maxwell equations , but also any other equation of motion that involves particles of integer spin living on a riemann surface .",
    "+ concerning the maxwell equations , the greatest difficulty in solving them is provided by the lack of a compact expression for the prime form . in fact , apart from the case of the @xmath4 metric of @xcite , the nontrivial gauge field configurations are expressed by means of the prime form @xcite . on the other side , on algebraic curves it is difficult to construct the @xmath4 metric because the canonically normalized differentials are not known ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for an attempt to construct these differentials ) . to circumvent these difficulties , we give here particular kinds of nondegenerate metrics which are singlevalued , i.e. they",
    "are invariant under arbitrary permutations of the sheets composing the algebraic curve .",
    "using these metrics the maxwell equations simplify considerably and the computation of their classical solutions is made possible .",
    "+ the material presented in this paper is divided as follows . in section 2 the maxwell field theory on riemann surfaces and algebraic curves",
    "is briefly introduced .",
    "the gauge fields are decomposed in their exact , coexact and harmonic components using the hodge decomposition theorem .",
    "the harmonic components are explicitly derived . in section 3",
    "we construct nondegenerate metrics on the @xmath0 algebraic curves .",
    "for some of these metrics the corresponding ricci tensor is computed .",
    "we check using the poincar ",
    "lelong equation @xcite , that different curvature tensors yield the same euler characteristics as expected . in section 4",
    "the topologically nontrivial solutions of the maxwell equations are derived .",
    "we verify that the magnetic fluxes generated by these gauge fields satisfy the dirac quantization condition .",
    "finally , in the conclusions we discuss the possible applications and generalizations of our results .",
    "in particular , it is shown how to generalize the metrics of section 3 to any affine algebraic curve . moreover ,",
    "the equations of motion of the scalar fields on algebraic curves are treated with some details and the hamiltonian of a massive electron immersed in a constant magnetic field is explicitly constructed .",
    "in this paper we consider the maxwell field theory on a riemann surface @xmath5 of genus @xmath6 and with @xmath0 group of symmetry .",

    "therefore , our procedure is not suitable for general algebraic curves .",
    "however , the metrics given in section 3 can be easily extended to any algebraic curve with weierstrass polynomial : @xmath243 where the @xmath244 are polynomials in @xmath46 . in this case , the metrics [ mgenmetr ] takes the form : @xmath245 with @xmath246 .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath247 depend on the form of the polynomial [ wpol ] and of the function @xmath88 . to determine @xmath247 ,",
    "one has to derive the divisors of @xmath248 , @xmath60 and @xmath249 as in eq .",

    "analogously , the metric [ nondegthree ] becomes on a general algebraic curve : @xmath250 ^\\beta dzd\\overline{z}\\ ] ] for suitable values of @xmath251 .",
    "the results of section 3 allows us to write explicitly the lagrangians of many field theories on algebraic curves .",
    "for instance , let us write the action for the scalar fields @xmath252 with mass @xmath253 : @xmath254   \\label{esse}\\ ] ] here @xmath255 is a general metric on @xmath11 with ricci tensor @xmath256 , @xmath257 is the branch index and @xmath258 represent real parameters .",
    "explicit examples of metrics and curvatures have been given above and in section 3 .",
    "let us notice that the integration in the right hand side of eq .",

    "lelong equation but the integrand is multivalued .",
    "moreover , @xmath259 and @xmath260 are total derivatives with respect to the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "total derivatives are used to remember that the fields @xmath261 depend on @xmath262 also through the functions @xmath263 . deriving the action [ esse ] with respect to the field @xmath261 in a given branch @xmath264",
    ", we find the equation of motion of the scalar fields :    @xmath265    where @xmath266    locally and far from the branch points , it is possible to solve [ sfeq ] with the standard methods of the theory of partial differential equations on the complex plane . in the case of the @xmath0",
    "symmetric curves we can even choose singlevalued metrics and curvatures , so that the coefficients appearing in the differential equation [ sfeq ] are singlevalued .",
    "nevertheless , any local solution derived in this way is in general multivalued and needs to be analytically continued in order to extend it over the whole algebraic curve . despite of the difficulties that may arise in the analytic continuation , the possibility of transforming differential equations on a riemann surface in differential equations on the sphere is remarkable .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations are allowed due the explicitness which is intrinsic in the representation of riemann surfaces in terms @xmath2sheeted coverings of the complex sphere .",
