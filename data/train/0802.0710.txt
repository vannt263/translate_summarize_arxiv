    "it has been known for a long time , that on non - simply connected spaces there can exist besides the standard scalar fields topological twisted fields @xcite .",
    "recently there is renewed interest in phenomenological and theoretical aspects of this kind of field theory @xcite , especially for the twisted version of the @xmath0-model with kink on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this model possess some interesting features , e.g. there appears a critical radius @xmath3 for the compactified dimension , so that for @xmath4 a twisted kink solution does not exist .",
    "even more , for @xmath5 the twisted kink is energetically preferred compared to the constant field configuration .",
    "compact spaces are also important in superstring theories , which are consistent only in ten space - time dimensions . if these theories describe the observed physical world , one has to explain why six space dimensions remain compactified and unobservable small .",
    "there are proposals that a casimir energy with a nontrivial behaviour with respect to the size of the compact dimensions may play a significant role in their stabilization @xcite .    assuming that in a ( 1 + 1)-dim .",
    "quantum field theory the radius @xmath6 and a mass scale @xmath7 are the only parameters with dimensions of length ( @xmath8 ) then from dimensional considerations the ground state energy has the general property @xmath9 , where the scaling function @xmath10 only depends on the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 .",
    "these scaling functions contain information about the conformal field theory reached for @xmath12 , which is a uv - fixpoint @xcite .",
    "to understand the quantum properties of the twisted @xmath0-model in the semiclassical regime , one has to consider the 1-loop corrections to the ground state @xcite .",
    "for @xmath4 the spectrum of the fluctuation equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath5 the ground state is the twisted kink and one has to quantize the small fluctuations in a spatial non - constant background , where the fluctuation equation is the @xmath2 lam equation , which is a quasi - exactly solvable differential equation @xcite .",
    "this means that only a finite subset of the ( anti-)periodic spectrum is exactly known .",
    "therefore only approximate expressions for the mass of the kink for @xmath13 and @xmath14 were obtained so far @xcite .    in order to find the mass correction without explicit knowledge of the eigenvalues , we use the contour integral representation of spectral zeta functions @xcite , where only an implicit knowledge of the fluctuation spectrum , the spectral discriminant , is necessary to determine the 1-loop energy of a smooth background field configuration ( for an early attempt in this direction see @xcite ) .",
    "this method was successfully applied to casimir energy calculations ( for a review see @xcite or @xcite ) or to the evaluation of functional determinants @xcite .",
    "we construct the spectral discriminant of the @xmath2 lam equation in terms of jacobi s elliptic functions @xcite ( the case @xmath15 was solved in @xcite , which is the fluctuation equation for the sine - gordon soliton on @xmath1 ) by solving a corresponding set of transcendental equations .",
    "these equations has been known for a long time @xcite and are the bethe ansatz equations for the @xmath2 lam equation @xcite , because the problem of solving a differential equation is shifted to the equivalent problem of solving certain transcendental equations . although the case @xmath2 was considered in @xcite an explicit construction of the spectral discriminant appropriate for numerical evaluations was missing there .",
    "recently the @xmath2 lam equation also appears in a model of tachyon condensation in string theory @xcite    the renormalized expression for the 1-loop quantum mass of the twisted kink in the sector @xmath5 obtained by this procedure interpolates continuously between the well known result for the ordinary kink of the @xmath0-model @xcite for @xmath14 and the ground state energy in the sector @xmath4 @xcite . the physical energy which is the sum of the classical and renormalized 1-loop contributions develops a minimum as function of @xmath6 , which indicates the existence of an energetically preferred radius @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we review the classical twisted kink solution in the @xmath0-theory @xcite . after that we discuss the special properties of the fluctuation equation of the twisted kink , which is the @xmath2 lam equation .",
    "we consider a self - interacting scalar field @xmath17 in two space - time dimensions with lagrangian @xmath18 with the spatial direction compactified with radius @xmath6 . by choosing antiperiodic conditions for the scalar field @xmath19 .",
    "the only allowed constant field configuration is @xmath20 .    in order to find @xmath21-dependent static solutions , one has to integrate the static field equation @xmath22 twice . after solving an elliptic integral ( for details",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) one gets @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a jacobi elliptic function .",
    "the elliptic modulus @xmath25 depends on the radius @xmath6 of the compactified dimension : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "the energy of this classical field configuration can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals of first and second kind : @xmath28.\\ ] ] remembering the properties of @xmath27 , one sees that for @xmath29 the spatial dimension becomes decompactified ( @xmath14 ) and the static solution ( [ eq : twistkink ] ) reduces to the well known @xmath0-kink solution @xmath30 while the energy ( [ eq : tkenergy ] ) becomes nothing else than the classical mass of the kink @xmath31 for @xmath32 the amplitude of the kink is forced to become zero .",
    "this happens at the critical radius @xmath33 the value of the energy @xmath34 matches at the point @xmath35 with the energy of the constant field configuration @xmath20 : @xmath36      to investigate the stability of static solutions and for semiclassical quantization one has to expand the field in the lagrangian into a static part and a fluctuating part @xmath37 @xcite , where the small fluctuations have also to be antiperiodic @xmath38 for the determination of the fluctuation spectrum in the minkowski vacuum without non - trivial boundary conditions , one has to expand about @xmath39 , which are the true vacuum states .",
    "the fluctuation equation is then given by @xmath40 when introducing the momentum - like parameter @xmath41 .",
    "thus the elementary excitations in this vacuum have a mass @xmath42 .",

    "it is easily seen that this is the case only for @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath5 the constant field configuration is unstable .    for @xmath5",
    "the fluctuation equation is the the @xmath2 lam equation in jacobian form @xmath52\\chi(\\bar x)=h\\chi(\\bar x),\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the term @xmath55 interpreted as a potential in a schroedinger equation is called finite - gap potential since the spectrum has @xmath56 forbidden bands @xcite .",
    "the first five eigenvalues are known ( with @xmath57 ) @xcite : @xmath58 besides the lowest eigenvalue , these are the endpoints of the forbidden bands .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions are lam polynomials ( e.g. @xmath59 ) . out of this",
    "five eigenfunctions only @xmath60 and @xmath61 have the required anti - periodicity .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath62 for @xmath63 are called transcendental lam functions and can be written as infinite power series in jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath50 as function of the elliptic modulus are not exactly known @xcite .",
    "in order to fix the notation we give in this section a short summary of zeta function regularization and the integral representation of spectral zeta functions @xcite .    for the eigenvalue problem @xmath64 with a second order differential operator @xmath65 and properly chosen boundary conditions ,",
    "the set of eigenvalues @xmath66 is discrete and bounded from below .",
    "if ( [ eq : diffeq ] ) is a fluctuation equation obtained by a semiclassical expansion the 1-loop energy contribution to the classical solution is given by @xmath67 in quantum field theories this expression is divergent and has to be regularized . in zeta function",
    "regularization one works with the spectral zeta function formally defined by @xmath68 with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 depends e.g. on the numbers of dimensions .",
    "the parameter @xmath71 with dimension of mass is introduced in order that the energy has the correct dimension for all values of @xmath72 .",
    "one can show @xcite , that @xmath73 has a well - defined analytic continuation as meromorphic function over the whole complex plane @xmath74 .",
    "the 1-loop contribution to the energy of a classical field configuration in zeta function regularization is then defined as the value of the analytic continuation of @xmath73 at @xmath75 : @xmath76 for renormalization we will apply the large mass subtraction scheme , which is widely used in casimir energy calculations @xcite . for a physical field with mass @xmath77 one",
    "expects that all quantum fluctuations will be suppressed in the limit of large mass @xmath77 , because for a field with infinite mass the quantum fluctuations should vanish .",
    "so one expects that for @xmath78 there are no 1-loop corrections at all and a good renormalization condition is @xcite @xmath79 with this prescription at hand one can identify and subtract the divergent ( when @xmath75 is a pole of @xmath73 ) contributions @xmath80 from @xmath81 and the renormalized energy is then given by @xmath82.\\ ] ] this can be achieved by introducing counterterms in the lagrangian , which have to cancel the @xmath83 parts @xcite .    in principle",
    "this can be applied to our problem for @xmath4 since we know the spectrum in this case ( see ( [ eq : fluctspect ] ) ) .",
    "but later we will see that after the analytical continuation the @xmath78 limit is not directly accessible .    as discussed in the last section the complete set of eigenvalues for the lam equation under ( anti-)periodic boundary conditions is unknown , so representation ( [ eq : zetadef ] ) of the spectral zeta function",
    "is of no use for our problem in the case @xmath5 .",
    "we need a representation of the zeta function , where only an implicit knowledge of the eigenvalues is necessary ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "assume we have a function @xmath84 , whose zeros of n - th order are at the positions @xmath85 of the n - fold degenerate eigenvalues of the spectral problem under consideration : @xmath86 such a function is called the spectral discriminant .",
    "then one can write the spectral zeta function as a contour integral @xmath87 with resolvent @xmath88 .",
    "the integrand has a branch cut along the negative real axis and poles at the positions of the zeros of @xmath84 .",
    "the contour @xmath89 runs counterclockwise from @xmath90 to the smallest eigenvalue , crosses the real axis between zero and the smallest eigenvalue and returns to @xmath91 . using the residue theorem ,",
    "one obtains the original definition of the zeta function ( [ eq : zetadef ] ) .",
    "a slight modification is needed , when the spectrum contains a zero mode @xmath92 , which means that @xmath84 and @xmath93 have a zero and pole at @xmath94 , respectively , the starting point of the branch cut . in this case",
    "one redefines @xmath95 in previous equations .",
    "depending on the behaviour of @xmath93 at infinity , for suitable values of @xmath72 the contour can now be deformed to lie just above and below the branch cut .",
    "one gets @xcite @xmath96 in terms of the momentum variable @xmath97 this expression is rewritten as @xmath98 with @xmath99 in deriving ( [ eq : zetaintlambda ] ) we have changed @xmath100 , which corresponds to @xmath101 .",

    "our results are valid as long as @xmath222 , we choose therefore @xmath223 and plotted the energy in units of @xmath77 .",
    "although only @xmath224 is the physical measurable quantity we have plotted @xmath200 for its own .",
    "figure 1 shows the 1-loop contribution @xmath200 given by ( [ eq : renenergyint ] ) for @xmath4 and ( [ eq : finalform ] ) for @xmath5 . for small @xmath6",
    "this contribution behaves like the casimir energy of a free massless scalar field with anti - periodic boundary conditions as can also be seen from ( [ eq : renenergybin ] ) : @xmath225    before @xmath6 approaches the critical radius @xmath3 the function develops a turning point and goes to negative energy values . at the critical radius @xmath3",
    "a cusp appears .    for @xmath14",
    "@xmath200 approaches the value of the 1-loop energy of the standard kink @xcite : @xmath226    figure 2 shows the physical energy ( [ eq : physicalen ] ) of the @xmath141 configuration in the sector @xmath4 and the twisted kink for @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath227 one expects additional higher loop fluctuations which travel around the compact dimension and may significantly contribute and smooth out the cusp in an all loop result . further we see that there exist an energetically preferred radius @xmath16 . using the approximation ( [ eq : approx ] ) the stabilization radius is given by @xmath228",
    "the stabilization radius exist since when we are going to smaller radius @xmath6 the classical part of ( [ eq : physicalen ] ) becomes less and less important compared to the growing 1-loop casimir - like contribution ( [ eq : renenergyint ] ) .",
    "finally , the sector @xmath5 is dominated by the classical energy of the twisted kink . as one can see , the 1-loop corrections do not change the qualitative behaviour of the classical contribution .",
    "one may worry about the balancing of classical and 1-loop contributions to the energy which results the minimum .",
    "the energy is formal an expansion in the parameter @xmath229 @xmath230 the balancing of the terms of order @xmath231 and @xmath232 is only valid if the higher loop contributions can be neglected . to see more clearly that this is indeed the case for small enough radius @xmath6 we expand the field @xmath233 and rescale the coordinates @xmath234 by @xmath235 the fluctuation action is then be written as ( using @xmath236 for @xmath4 ) @xmath237\\ ] ] with the dimensionless parameters @xmath238 in contrast to the case of @xmath0 on the infinite line , where only one dimensionless parameter @xmath239 exists .",
    "now one can see that making the radius of the compactified dimension small ( @xmath142 ) by holding @xmath48 and @xmath77 fixed is equivalent to decreasing the effective dimensionless coupling constant @xmath240 for the theory on the unit circle . in the limit",
    "@xmath142 one ends up with a free gaussian action and the terms of @xmath241 can be neglected .",
    "so for some small @xmath242 the only relevant terms are the classical and 1-loop contribution . since @xmath243 ( see ( [ eq : minradius ] ) ) , by appropriate choose of @xmath77 one can achieve @xmath244 and the minimum is valid .",
    "of course a quantitative estimate of the higher loop effects lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless a quantitative comparison of semiclassical and exact results is in principle possible in the case of the sine - gordon soliton on @xmath1 which is an integrable model @xcite .",
    "the corresponding fluctuation equation is the much simpler @xmath15 lam equation @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "when @xmath245 the energy of the twisted kink @xmath246 becomes negative for certain values of @xmath25 ( or @xmath6 ) .",
    "fortunately this happens outside of the region of validity @xmath222 .",
    "although negative energies are no problem as long as one talks about casimir energies , one runs into troubles if one wants to interpret @xmath246 as the mass of the twisted kink .",
    "it is known from the sine - gordon model that for values of the coupling constant where the mass of the quantum soliton is formally negative the theory has no stable ground state @xcite .",
    "we have constructed an integral representation of the 1-loop energy contribution of the twisted kink of @xmath0-theory in semiclassical quantization appropriate for numerical evaluations .",
    "we used special finite - gap properties of the fluctuation equation , which is the @xmath2 lam equation , to obtain an analytic expression for the spectral discriminant @xmath84 and the related quasi - momentum @xmath247 .",
    "although the lam equation is a classic subject in mathematical physics , an explicit expression for the quasi - momentum in the case @xmath2 as function of the eigenvalue parameter @xmath48 , was still missing @xcite .",
    "our renormalized expressions of the 1-loop energy refine some previously obtained results in @xcite and completes the discussion in @xcite for twisted @xmath0-theory in the sector @xmath5 .",
    "we have shown that the large mass renormalization condition can not be applied for @xmath4 because the analytic continuations by binomial expansion and integral representation are only valid for @xmath156 .",
    "therefore we have fixed the energy renormalization in this sector after renormalization for @xmath5 by the condition that the renormalized energies have to be continuous at @xmath35 . in the limit @xmath14",
    "we have obtained the well known 1-loop energy of the standard @xmath0-kink .",
    "a further observation we made is , that for @xmath4 a dynamical preferred radius @xmath248 exist .",
    "the existence of a minimum in the energy is a result of the interplay between the classical and 1-loop energy contributions .    from the viewpoint of identifying a mechanism for stabilizing extra dimensions one has to include gravity in our considerations and examine whether minima in the energy density appear @xcite .",
    "also one can impose on ( [ eq : gensolution ] ) other boundary conditions as ( anti-)periodic , e.g. orbifold compactification @xmath249 and analyse the 1-loop effects to the corresponding orbifold kinks @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation equation remains the same , only the allowed eigenvalues will change by the different boundary conditions .    in order to find the quasi momentum and the spectral discriminant for @xmath250 lam equations , one has to solve a set of @xmath56 bethe ansatz equations , which become increasingly complicated for larger @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "at least the first derivatives of the quasi momentum up to @xmath251 are known explicitly @xcite .",
    "these lam equations can be understood as fluctuation equations of kink solutions of some quantum field theory on @xmath1 where the interaction @xmath252 is only known implicitly . in the limit @xmath14 the @xmath250 lam equations will then lead to the reflectionsless potentials considered in @xcite .",
    "consider the spectral zeta function ( [ eq : regzeta ] ) @xmath253^{-s}.\\ ] ] for @xmath254 we can expand ( [ eq : apzeta ] ) in binomials : @xmath255 in the region of absolute convergence , we can interchange the order of summation : @xmath256 where we have used the following identities : @xmath257 and @xmath258 with the riemann zeta function @xmath259 .",
    "from ( [ eq : translos ] ) one sees , that @xmath260 for @xmath32 .",
    "we use therefore the following identities for jacobi zeta function with imaginary argument : @xmath261=\\nonumber\\\\   & = & i\\left[-i\\frac{\\mathrm{sn}(iu , k)\\mathrm{dn}(iu , k)}{\\mathrm{cn}(iu , k)}-z(u , k')-\\frac{\\pi u}{2\\mathbf{kk'}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ eq : translos ] ) one gets also @xmath262 so ( [ eq : imaginaer ] ) can be written as @xmath263.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath32 and @xmath264 this reduces to @xmath265.\\ ] ] the quasi - momentum becomes @xmath266 finally the spectral discriminant becomes @xmath267",
