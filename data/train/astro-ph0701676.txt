    "pulsars form the second most numerous class of objects detected in high - energy @xmath0-rays . to date , six have been detected by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) aboard the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "the @xmath0-ray pulsations observed from these objects are particularly important as a direct signature of non - thermal processes in rotating neutron - star magnetospheres , and potentially should help to discriminate among different emission models .",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere can be divided into two zones : the closed zone filled with a dense plasma corotating with the star , and the open zone in which plasma flows along the open field lines to escape through the light cylinder .",
    "the last - open field lines form the border of the open magnetic field line bundle . in all the pulsar emission models ,",
    "particle acceleration takes place in this open zone . in inner - gap",
    "( ig ) models , which adopts particle acceleration within several neutron - star radii above the polar - cap surface , the energetics and pair cascade spectrum have had success in reproducing the observations ( e.g. , daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ) . however , the predicted beam size is too small to produce the wide pulse profiles that are observed from high - energy pulsars . seeking the possibility of a wide hollow cone emission due to flaring field lines , muslimov and harding ( 2004 ) extended the idea of arons ( 1983 ) and proposed a slot - gap ( sg ) model , in which emission takes place very close to the last - open field line from the stellar surface to the outer magnetosphere .",
    "since the sg model is an extension of the ig model into the outer magnetosphere , a negative magnetic - field - aligned electric field , @xmath1 , arises if the magnetic moment vector points in the same hemisphere as the rotation vector .",
    "however , the electric current induced by the negative @xmath1 does not have a self - consistent closure within the model ( hirotani  2006 , hereafter h06 ) .",
    "to contrive an accelerator model that predicts an outward current in the lower latitudes ( within the open zone ) , it is straightforward to extend outer - gap ( og ) models ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , hereafter ry95 ; cheng et al .",
    "2000 ) into the inner magnetosphere . extending several og models ( hirotani et al .",
    "2003 ; takata et al .  2004 ) , h06 demonstrated that the gap extends from the stellar surface to the outer magnetosphere , that the positive @xmath1 extracts ions from the star as a space - charge - limited flow ( sclf ) , and that most photon emission takes place in the outer magnetosphere because @xmath1 is highly screened inside the null surface owing to the discharge of the created pairs .",
    "in the present letter , we formulate the scheme ( beskin et al .",
    "1992 ) in   [ sec : basic_eqs ] , apply it to three rotation - powered pulsars in   [ sec : appl ] , and give a brief discussion in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we follow the scheme described in   2 of h06 to solve the set of maxwell and boltzmann equations .",
    "the first equation we have to consider is the poisson equation for the electro - static potential , @xmath2 .",
    "as space is limited , we present its newtonian expression , @xmath3 .",
    "if the real charge density , @xmath4 , deviates from the goldreich - julian ( gj ) charge density , @xmath5 , in some region , an acceleration electric field @xmath6 arises , where @xmath7 designates the distance along a magnetic field line .",
    "the second equation we have to consider is the boltzmann equations for @xmath8 s . assuming a steady state in the frame of reference corotating with the magnetosphere",
    ", we obtain @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the speed of light , @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) the dimensionless positronic ( or electronic ) distribution function normalized by the local gj number density .",
    "the temporal derivatives of momentum and pitch angle , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the collision term @xmath15 are explicitly given in h06 .",
    "synchro - curvature radiation - reaction force is included as an external force in @xmath13 , while the effects of inverse - compton scatterings ( ics ) and ( one - photon and two - photon ) pair creation processes are in @xmath15 .",
    "the third equation we have to consider is the boltzmann equations for photons . assuming a steady state , and neglecting azimuthal propagations",
    ", we obtain @xmath16 where the wave numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by the ray path , ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) are the polar coordinates , and the dimensionless photon distribution function @xmath21 is normalized by the gj number density at the stellar surface .",
    "ics , synchro - curvature emission , and the absorption are contained in @xmath22 . in h06 , the rate of synchrotron emission by secondary pairs created outside the gap ,",
    "was calculated assuming a constant pitch angle .",
    "however , it turns out that only 17  % of the initial particle energy is converted into radiation . in this letter",
    ", we corrected this problem by computing the pitch angle evolution of radiating particles , which increases the synchrotron cooling time and hence recovers the time - integrated , radiated energy to 100  % of the initial particle energy .",
    "note that the gap electrodynamics investigated in h06 remains correct , despite the insufficient secondary synchrotron fluxes in h06 .    to solve the poisson equation",
    ", we impose @xmath23 at the lower , upper , and inner ( @xmath24 ) boundaries , and @xmath25 at the outer boundary .",
    "ion extraction rate is regulated by the condition @xmath26 at @xmath24 .",
    "we parameterize the trans - field thickness of the gap with @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 the gap exists along all the open field lines , while if @xmath29 the gap becomes transversely thin .",
    "we apply the theory to three @xmath0-ray pulsars , crab , vela , and b1951 + 32 , focusing on their photon spectra . even near and outside the light cylinder ,",
    "photon emission and absorption occur effectively ; thus , equations  ( [ eq : basic_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : basic_3 ] ) are solved in @xmath30 , where @xmath26 in @xmath31 ; @xmath32 denotes the light cylinder radius , @xmath33 the stellar rotation frequency , and @xmath34 the distance from the rotation axis . the field line geometry in @xmath35",
    "mimics the aligned dipole in the force - free magnetosphere ( contopoulos et al .",
    "1999 ; gruzinov 2005 ) . in @xmath36 ,",
    "the field lines are assumed to be straight so that they connect smoothly at @xmath37 .",
    "we present the results for the crab pulsar in figure  [ fig : spc_crab ] , adopting a magnetic inclination of @xmath38 and a dipole moment of @xmath39 , which is close to the value ( @xmath40 ) deduced from the dipole radiation formula .",
    "it follows that the observed pulsed spectrum from ir to vhe can be reproduced , provided that we observe the photons emitted into @xmath41 , where @xmath20 denotes the photon propagation direction measured from the rotational axis . because of the aberration of light , it is reasonable to suppose that photons emitted in a certain range of @xmath20 comes into our line of sight in an obliquely rotating three - dimensional magnetosphere ( e.g. , ry95 ) .",
    "the flux rapidly decreases with decreasing @xmath20 for @xmath42 , because @xmath1 is highly screened in the inner part of the gap .",
    "nevertheless , an average over @xmath43 , which includes negligible flux between @xmath44 , achieves the current objective , because the spectral normalization can be fitted ( within a factor of a few ) without changing the spectral shape , by adjusting @xmath27 .",
    "ics takes place efficiently near and outside the light cylinder ( aharonian & bogovalov 2003 ) , because the magnetospheric ir photons , which are emitted along convex field lines , collide with the gap - accelerated positrons near the light cylinder , where the field lines are concave .",
    "most of such upscattered photons , as well as some of the high - energy tail of the curvature component , are absorbed by the @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions . as a result , there is a gradual turnover around 10  gev , which forms a striking contrast with the steep turnover predicted in ig models due to magnetic pair creation .",
    "the primary curvature component appears between 100  mev and 10  gev , while the secondary synchrotron component appears below a few mev . between a few mev and 100  mev , the ics component dominates , because the secondary pairs that have been cooled down below a few hundred mev efficiently up - scatter magnetospheric uv and x - rays to lose energy .",
    "similar spectral shapes are obtained for different values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath27 , provided that the created current is super gj , by virtue of the negative feedback effects ( h06 ) .",
    "next , we present the results for the vela pulsar in figure  [ fig : spc_vela ] ( left ) . taking an angle average over @xmath41 ( solid line ) , we can reproduce the observed pulsed spectrum , except for the rxte results .",
    "the primary curvature component appears between 100  mev and 10  gev , while the secondary and tertiary synchrotron components appear below 100 mev .",
    "ics is negligible for the vela pulsar because of its weak magnetospheric emission .",
    "similar spectral shapes are obtained for super - gj solutions , even though we have to adjust @xmath27 to obtain an appropriate flux .    in the right panel",
    ", we compare the present results with ig ( dotted ) and og ( dashed ) models , where the dash - dotted line denotes the averaged flux for @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that the spectrum between 10 and 100 gev crucially depends on the angles in which the photons that we observe are emitted .",
    "thus , to quantitatively predict the @xmath0-ray emission from the outer magnetosphere , it is essential to examine the three - dimensional magnetic field structure near and outside the light cylinder .",
    "thirdly and finally , we present the spectrum of b1951 + 32 in figure  [ fig : spc_1951 ] ( left ) .",
    "it follows that the rosat and egret fluxes are reproduced by taking the flux average in @xmath41 ( solid line ) , except for 17  gev flux , which was derived from only two photons . because of its weak magnetic field , less energetic synchrotron photons reduce the absorption of the ics component .",
    "the reduced absorption results in a small synchrotron flux , which further reduces the absorption outside the light cylinder , leading to a large , unabsorbed tev fluxes .",
    "it also follows that the spectrum turns over at lower energy than the ig model prediction ( dotted curve in the right panel ; harding  2001 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the predicted ics flux ( above 100 gev ) represents a kind of upper limits , because it is obtained by assuming that all the magnetospheric synchrotron photons illuminate the equatorial region in which gap - accelerated positrons are migrating .",
    "some of such vhe photons materialize as energetic secondary pairs , emitting the synchrotron component between a few kev and 100  mev . between 100  mev and 30  gev",
    ", the primary curvature component dominates , which represents the absolute flux ( instead of upper limits ) .",
    "some of such curvature photons have energies above 10  gev and are efficiently absorbed to materialize as less energetic pairs , which emit synchrotron radiation below a few kev .",
    "thus , the spectrum below a few kev also represents the absolute flux .",
    "to sum up , the self - consistent gap solutions basically reproduce the observed power - law spectra below a few gev for the three pulsars examined .",
    "the cut - off spectra between 10  gev and 100  gev strongly reflect the three - dimensional magnetic field configuration near the light cylinder ; thus , a discrimination between ig and og models ( e.g. , using glast ) should be carefully carried out .",
    "if pulsations are detected above 100  gev , it undoubtedly indicates that the photons are emitted via ics near the light cylinder , because vhe emissions can not be expected in ig models .    since our analysis is limited within the two - dimensional plane formed by the magnetic field lines that thread the stellar surface on the plane containing both the rotational and magnetic axes , azimuthal structure is still unknown .",
    "thus , we can not present pulse profiles , phase - resolved spectra , or the polarization angle variations in this letter . since the gap is most active in the outer part of the magnetosphere ( unlike previous og models , which adopt the vacuum solution of the poisson equation and hence a uniform emissivity ) , and since the photons will be emitted along the instantaneous particle motion measured by a static observer ( unlike the treatment in the og model of ry95 , who assume a very strong aberration of light near the light cylinder ) , it is possible that the predicted pulse profiles and so on are quite different from previous og models",
    ". these topics will be discussed in the subsequent paper , which deals with the three - dimensional gap structure near the light cylinder .",
    "the pulsed tev flux from psr  b1951 + 32 can be predicted to be above @xmath48  jyhz , provided that a certain fraction ( more than @xmath49 ) of the magnetospheric soft photons illuminate the equatorial region .",
    "however , if the poloidal field lines are more or less straight near the light cylinder , as demonstrated by spitkovsky ( 2006 , fig .",
    "2 ) for an oblique rotator , the equatorial region may not be efficiently illuminated . in this case",
    ", the vhe flux will decrease from the current prediction .",
    "there is room for further investigation how to extend the present analysis into three dimensions , and to combine it with time - dependence three - dimensional force - free electrodynamics .",
