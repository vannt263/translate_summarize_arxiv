    "<S> the width of the flaps is large enough to neglect fracture energy ( @xmath65 mm ) except for the extreme tip of the convergent tears ; ii ) the distortion of the peeling front induces a rotation of the path direction of the cracks by an angle @xmath63 ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> _ , this point represents the ultimate tip of the tear ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ solution ] ) simplifies to @xmath82 which captures almost perfectly the evolution of the tears shape for various samples ( see the master curve in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig4]a ) . for the positive curvature , </S>",
    "<S> pulling an adhesive can produce either opening ( `` spatulate '' ) or closing ( `` elliptic '' ) tears as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c and d , depending on the initial value of the flap width . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , these morphologies and the transition in shape with the width are also captured by the model . for @xmath83 , </S>",
    "<S> the solution reads @xmath84 from this equation , two different regimes are indeed expected depending on the flap width . for large initial width ( @xmath85 or @xmath86 ) , we observe a rapid opening of the tears contrasting with the triangular shapes previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is predicted by the model since in this case , the exponential term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ solution - plus ] ) is strictly positive . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the experimental data is very good , a master curve of all the results being given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b . for small width ( @xmath87 or @xmath88 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we recover closing tears but with an `` elliptic leaf - like '' shape instead of an acuminate one . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is also predicted by our model since in this case , the exponential term of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ solution - plus ] ) is strictly negative . </S>",
    "<S> again , the model based on geometry arguments captures the variety of the tear morphology observed for curved substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between opening and closing crack paths predicted by the model is also experimentally observed and perfectly reproduced by the theory ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that , for positively curved substrates and a given set of experimental conditions ( @xmath51 , @xmath11 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath25 ) there is a single value of the width @xmath89 that produces tears with a constant width and parallel cracks . </S>",
    "<S> this value obviously corresponds to an unstable state lying between both opening and closing domains .    as shown here above , the peeling front is linear for peeling angle close to @xmath61 regardless of the curvature of the substrate . as expected from the proposed model , </S>",
    "<S> the tears adopt a triangular morphology for various curved substrates when the flap is pulled at @xmath60 , see the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a .    in conclusion , we have demonstrated for flaps detached from films glued to simple circular cylinders that a constant mean curvature strongly affects the crack path and thus the shape of the tears . moreover , the proposed model can be readily extended to any developable surface , _ i.e. _ conical or cylindrical . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , eq .  ( [ equa_diff ] ) describes the local behavior of the crack propagation and , therefore , a spatial variation of the surface curvature can be easily introduced </S>",
    "<S> . a possible extension of this work could be the study of the influence of gaussian curvature on crack path and tear morphology for surfaces such as sphere , hyperboloid .    </S>",
