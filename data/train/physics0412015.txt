    "the rapid development in the field of lab - on - a - chip systems during the past decade has put emphasis on studies of shape - dependence in microfluidic channels . traditionally , capillary tubes would have circular cross - sections , but today microfabricated channels have a variety of shapes depending on the fabrication technique in use .",
    "examples are rectangular channels obtained by hot embossing in polymer wafers , semi - circular channels in isotropically etched surfaces , triangular channels in koh - etched silicon crystals , gaussian - shaped channels in laser - ablated polymer films , and elliptic channels in stretched pdms devices , see e.g. , ref .  .    the pressure - driven , steady - state flow of a liquid through long , straight , and rigid channels of any constant cross - sectional shape is referred to as hagen  poiseuille ( or simply poiseuille ) flow , and it is often characterized by the hydraulic resistance , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the pressure drop along the channel and @xmath7 the flow rate through the channel . in fig .  [ fig : geometry ]",
    "is shown an arbitrarily shaped cross - section @xmath8 in the @xmath9 plane for a straight channel placed along the @xmath10 axis . a natural unit for the hydraulic resistance",
    "is given by dimensional analysis as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the channel length , @xmath13 the dynamic viscosity of the liquid , and @xmath14 the cross - sectional area .",
    "typically , the fluid flow is subject to a no - slip boundary condition at the walls @xmath15 and thus the actual hydraulic resistance will depend on the perimeter as well as the cross - section area .",
    "this dependence can therefore be characterized by the dimensionless geometrical correction factor @xmath3 given by @xmath16 in lab - on - a - chip applications  @xcite , where large surface - to - volume ratios are encountered , the problem of the bulk poiseuille flow is typically accompanied by other surface - related physical or bio - chemical phenomena in the fluid .",
    "the list of examples includes surface chemistry , dna hybridization on fixed targets , catalysis , interfacial electrokinetic phenomena such as electro - osmosis , electrophoresis and electro - viscous effects as well as continuous edge - source diffusion .",
    "though the phenomena are of very different nature , they have at least one thing in common ; they are all to some degree surface phenomena and their strength and effectiveness depends strongly on the surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "it is common to quantify this by the dimensionless compactness @xmath4 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the perimeter of the boundary @xmath19 confining the fluid , see fig .",

    "we refer to ref .",
    "and references therein . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate a simple dependence of the geometrical correction factor @xmath3 on the compactness @xmath4 and our results thus point out a unified dimensionless measure of flow properties as well as the strength and effectiveness of surface - related phenomena central to lab - on - a - chip applications .",
    "furthermore , our results allow for an easy evaluation of the hydraulic resistance for elliptical , rectangular , and triangular cross - sections with the geometrical measure @xmath4 being the only input parameter .",
    "above we have emphasized microfluidic flows because here a variety of shapes are frequently encountered .",
    "however , our results are generally valid for all laminar flows .",
    "due to translation invariance along the @xmath10 axis the velocity field of a newtonian fluid in a straight channel is parallel to the @xmath10 axis , and takes the form @xmath20 .",
    "consequently , the non - linear term in the navier  stokes equation drops out  @xcite , and in steady - state , given the pressure gradient @xmath21 , the velocity @xmath22 is thus given by the poisson equation , @xmath23 with the velocity being subject to a no - slip condition at the boundary @xmath24 .",
    "the relation between the pressure drop @xmath6 , the velocity @xmath22 , and the geometrical correction factor @xmath3 becomes @xmath25 where @xmath7 is the volume flow rate .",
    "our main objective is to find the relation between the geometrical correction factor @xmath3 and the compactness @xmath4 for various families of geometries .",

    "( [ eq : alpha - triangle ] ) allows for an easy evaluation of @xmath57 for triangular channels .      by use of shape perturbation theory",

    "since @xmath3 is also quadratic in @xmath58 this means that @xmath3 depends linearly on @xmath4 to fourth order in @xmath58 , @xmath87 note that although derived for @xmath88 this expression coincides with that of the ellipse , eq .  , for @xmath89 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_epsilon ] ) [ to second order in @xmath58 ] with exact numerics we find that for @xmath58 up to 0.4 the relative error is less than 0.2% and 0.5% for @xmath89 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "we have considered pressure - driven , steady state poiseuille flow in straight channels with various shapes , and found a close - to - linear relation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . since the hydraulic resistance is @xmath92 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath93 depends linearly on @xmath94 . different classes of shape all display this linear relation , but the coefficients are non - universal",
    ". however , for each class only two points need to be calculated to fully specify the relation for the entire class .",
    "the difference is due to the smoothness of the boundaries .",
    "the elliptical and harmonic - perturbed classes have boundaries without any cusps whereas the rectangular and triangular classes have sharp corners .",
    "the over - all velocity profile tends to be convex and maximal near the center - of - mass of the channel , see fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "if the boundary is smooth the velocity in general goes to zero in a convex parabolic manner whereas a concave parabolic dependence is generally found if the boundary has a sharp corner ( this can be proved explicitly for the equilateral triangle @xcite ) .",
    "since the concave drop is associated with a region of low velocity compared to the convex drop , geometries with sharp changes in the boundary tend to have a higher hydraulic resistance compared to smooth geometries with equivalent cross - sectional area .",
    "we believe that the explicit and simple link between @xmath95 and @xmath4 is an important observation since at the same time @xmath4 is also central to the strength and effectiveness of various surface - related phenomena .",
    "we note that in micro - channels the flow properties and electrokinetic phenomena may be somewhat connected and substantial deviations from classical poiseuille flow have been reported recently , see ref .   and references therein .",
    "nevertheless , our observation is an important first step with relevance to the use of micro - fluidic channels in lab - on - a - chip applications .",
    "furthermore , our results allow for an easy evaluation of the hydraulic resistance for elliptical , rectangular , and triangular cross - sections with the geometrical measure @xmath4 being the only input parameter .",
