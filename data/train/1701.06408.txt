    "two - dimensional ion - trap arrays have become important tools for the development of large - scale quantum information processing @xcite and quantum simulation @xcite based on atomic ions .",
    "in particular , surface - electrode ( se ) radiofrequency ( rf ) ion traps in which all electrodes lie in a plane @xcite offer the possibility of integrating multiple trapping zones and of precisely shaping electrodes , and therefore , trapping potentials .",
    "the scalability of se structures offered by microfabrication methods paves the way for novel large - scale experiments @xcite .",
    "translationally cold and quantum - state controlled molecular ions , on the other hand , are promising platforms for fundamental studies such as the test of the time invariance of physical constants @xcite , as well as for applications ranging from precision spectroscopy @xcite and metrology @xcite to collision studies @xcite and controlled chemistry @xcite .",
    "the workhorse technique for preparing such systems is sympathetic cooling with laser - cooled co - trapped atomic ions @xcite in rf traps @xcite .",
    "this method enables the formation of coulomb - crystallised molecular ions at temperatures in the millikelvin range@xcite .",
    "recently , the sympathetic cooling of molecular ions in a se rf trap has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the extension of se trapping technology to cold molecular ions opens up exciting possibilities , e.g. , the implementation of miniaturised guided - ion - beam experiments which could combine mass spectrometry , spectroscopy , reaction studies , and cold chemistry experiments on a chip device .    in order to develop an ion - trapping network ,",
    "the key ingredient is junctions .",
    "usually , a junction is thought of as a connection between identical trap arrays , e.g. , a t- , y- , or x- ( cross ) junction connecting quadrupolar channels @xcite .",
    "in addition , a junction can be seen as an element that enables the modification of trapping fields between two different trapping configurations , e.g. , a quadrupole - to - octupole junction which can be of interest for , e.g. , connecting a standard quadrupole ion transport channel with a large - volume octupolar ion storage region .",
    "such field - modifying junctions allow the manipulation of the ion - crystal structures as well as the separation of a single harmonic well into a double - well trapping configuration with potential applications in quantum information and quantum matter - wave experiments @xcite .",
    "the main challenge to the use of se junctions arises from the fact that the lowest - order multipole component of the rf field at the centre of a given intersection is a hexapole determined by the tangents of the intersecting channels @xcite . in rf traps ,",
    "the trapping potential is usually calculated within the adiabatic approximation @xcite in which a time - independent pseudopotential derived from the rf field governs the confinement of ions @xcite .",
    "straight rf electrodes intersecting at right angles do not provide pseudopotential confinement perpendicular to the paths due to field cancellation .",
    "the pseudopotential at the centre becomes stiffer as the angle between straight arms is reduced and also as the number of intersecting channels decreases .",
    "for this reason , se y - junctions @xcite were initially preferred to se x - junctions @xcite .",
    "x - junctions are particularly important for applications which need to economize space , e.g. , highly integrated experiments .",
    "recently , efforts have been invested in developing such junctions resulting in their successful demonstration and in new techniques for better controlling ion shuttling operations @xcite .",
    "one of the key elements for these achievements is the optimisation of the rf - electrode geometry in the vicinity of the intersections such that ions are confined along the direction perpendicular to the surface @xcite .",
    "the ion - trap junctions that have been developed thus far were designed to enable the shuttling of single - species atomic ion crystals while minimising ion heating during transport @xcite . besides the applications in molecular physics mentioned above , the extension of this technology to bicomponent coulomb crystals is also important for quantum technology and quantum computation with mixed - species crystals @xcite .",
    "the challenge for the transportation of bicomponent crystals through junctions arises from the mass dependence of the pseudopotential .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a general method for the optimisation of an arbitrary planar junction in accordance with the requirements for the transportation of mixed - species ion crystals ( section [ sec : moo ] ) .",
    "this approach is applied to design a cross between four quadrupoles and to a quadrupole - to - octupole junction discussed in detail in section [ sec : res_ana ] .",
    "based on this study , a design of a multi - functional ion - trap array which enables the integration of several experiments on a single - layer chip is presented ( section  [ sec : mfit ] ) .",
    "transporting ions through se junctions requires the minimisation of several objectives .",
    "a variety of objective functions has been considered @xcite , and thus , the question arises which physical quantities are relevant when optimising an electrode structure for a given application .",
    "first and foremost , the suppression of pseudopotential barriers that impede ion transport is crucial @xcite .",
    "note that the position of pseudopotential minima , where the rf field vanishes , solely depends on the trap geometry , and thus is identical for all ion masses .",
    "however , the mass dependence of the pseudopotential may cause a segregation of laser - cooled and sympathetically cooled ions during the transportation over barriers which could lead to insufficient cooling and high loss rates of molecular ions .",
    "thus , for shuttling mixed - species ion crystals the height of pseudopotential barriers is the most important quantity to be minimised ( objective 1 ) .    for reliable shuttling of ion qubits , axial pseudopotential gradients that cause ion heating",
    "must be suppressed @xcite , since at intersections , where noise on the rf potential is present , axial motional modes of ions might be excited @xcite .",
    "thus , for applications in quantum computation the minimisation of the pseudopotential gradient is crucial ( objective 2 ) .",
    "an alternative approach to near - motional - ground - state shuttling of ions is the minimisation of the variation of the axial potential curvature @xcite .",
    "we note that this optimisation objective is less important in the present context as the molecular ions are continuously sympathetically cooled by laser - cooled ions , also during shuttling .",
    "furthermore , the variation of the trapping height needs to be controlled for two reasons .",
    "first , weakly confining potentials at se intersections might cause significant ion losses .",
    "this issue can be mitigated by using static fields that forces ions to circumnavigate the junction centre at the expense of moving the trapping minima away from the pseudopotential null @xcite .",
    "this technique is unsuited for bicomponent crystals due to the risk of the drastic segregation of ionic species under the influence of such a static field @xcite .",
    "second , for the transportation of molecular ions together with laser cooled atomic ions in the presence of cooling beams large variations of the trapping height should be avoided ( objective 3 ) .",
    "these three objectives evaluated at the ion channel @xmath0 , where @xmath1 represents the values of _ y _ and _ z _ that minimise @xmath2 at a certain _ x _ , can be cast into the following mathematical form : @xmath3 @xmath4 ( @xmath5=1 , 2 , 3 ) denotes the @xmath5th objective function , @xmath6 is the pseudopotential , @xmath7 is the coordinate of the initial trapping zone , @xmath8 is the component of @xmath9 perpendicular to the chip surface , and @xmath10 is the intended trapping height . note that the minimisation of pseudopotential barriers might occur at the cost of large trapping height variations and vice versa",
    ".    an efficient method of solving multi - objective optimisation problems is the weighted sum method in which a function @xmath11 is minimised @xcite : @xmath12\\\\ \\nonumber & = \\lbrace w_{1}\\xi_{1 } , w_{2}\\xi_{2 } , w_{3}\\xi_{3}\\rbrace \\cdot \\lbrace f_{1},f_{2},f_{3}\\rbrace .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13",
    "( @xmath5=1 , 2 , 3 ) is the weighting factor for the @xmath5th objective function @xmath4 which determines a comparative contribution specifing the user s preference .",
    "the lower - bound transformation method @xcite was used to ensure _",
    "f@xmath14 _ are of comparable magnitudes in numerical calculations .",
    "thereby , the transformation coefficient @xmath15 ( @xmath5=1 , 2 , 3 ) was given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17  =  minimum @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denote the @xmath20 degrees of freedom , see section  [ subsec : design space ] .",
    "as highlighted by equation  ( [ eqn : obj_total ] ) , it is important to notice a subtle distinction between using weights to determine the user s preferences and using weights to transform objective functions .",
    "the @xmath21 are arbitrary values systematically varied in the interval ( 0,1 ) to set the relative importance of the objectives ; see , e.g. , the specified values of @xmath21 and @xmath15 presented in appendix a.    in our calculations , we used normalized ( non - dimensional ) objective functions @xmath4 in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "a non - dimensional pseudopotential can be written as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the rf - electrodes basis function @xcite which depends solely on the geometry .",
    "here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the mass and charge of the trapped ions , @xmath10 is the trapping height , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the rf drive amplitude and angular frequency , respectively . building on this formalism , the objective functions and , hence , solutions of the optimisation are independent of the mass of the ions , the trapping parameters ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) as well as the trapping height .",
    "note that owing to the normalisation of @xmath28 in equation ( [ eqn : obj functions3 ] ) the trapping height , which is a characteristic length of the system , does not contribute to our optimisation calculations , and can be substituted in the final result . as a result ,",
    "the geometries obtained ( see appendix a ) present universal se structures applicable to any mass or set of trapping parameters .      in this study , the design space refers to a set of parameters defining rf electrode geometries to be used in optimisation processes .",
    "the number and locations of control points specifying rf electrode shapes were varied according to the three methods shown with the example of a cross junction in figure  [ fig : design - space ] .",
    "the first approach utilized four control points , where two points on each perimeter are connected simply via a line ( figure  [ fig : design - space](a ) ) .",
    "the choice of only four parameters accelerated optimisation processes and led to satisfactory solutions despite the low number of degrees of freedom .",

    ", the rf electrodes are shown in colour , the red points indicate the control points , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the width of central dc and rf electrodes , respectively .",
    "the control points are connected via lines in ( a ) , line elements defined by @xmath31 , their distance @xmath32 and the involved channel length _",
    "l _ in ( b ) , and cubic splines in ( c)-(d ) .",
    "( d ) shows the eight parameters specifying each cubic spline , i.e. , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , which are the positions of the initial and final points and the amplitude as well as the orientation angle of the first derivatives of the electrode boundary function at these points . in ( c ) , each point , labelled with its abscissa value , exhibits three degrees of freedom , and the electrode geometry was fully defined by @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "note that only one eighth of the geometry was parametrised due to dihedral d@xmath39 symmetry in every cross junction as highlighted by dashed lines . ]    in the second approach , the inner and outer rf electrode edges were broken up into several line elements ( figure  [ fig : design - space](b ) ) .",
    "we began with four control points and increased them up to 20 points while aiming for improved results .",
    "careful attention must be paid when increasing the number of degrees of freedom because it does not necessarily result in better solutions due to the higher probability of getting trapped in local minima of the optimisation function .",
    "this method of parametrisation has been widely used @xcite , however , electrode structures obtained often exhibited sharp features arising from underdetermined geometrical constraints .",
    "fourier components of the surface potential of wavelength @xmath40 exponentially decrease as exp(@xmath41 ) @xcite , and consequently , the field is not significantly influenced by geometric elements of size @xmath42 .",
    "such sharp features @xcite might also hinder precise manufacturing and would reduce breakdown voltages through the bulk or surface flashover .    thus , we employed a third approach to mitigate these issues by using cubic splines to define the design .",
    "control points on each electrode perimeter were bound to a cubic spline specified by eight parameters , see figure  [ fig : design - space](c)-(d ) . because of symmetry , the number of parameters for each spline was eventually reduced to six , and thus the geometry of the cross junction was defined by 12 parameters .",
    "this method of parametrisation was found to be flexible as well as efficient and was mainly used in our calculations .      in our calculations ,",
    "a two - step optimisation process was applied . in the first optimisation ,",
    "the potential generated by se electrodes was analytically calculated in the `` gapless plane approximation '' @xcite using the _ surfacepattern _ software package @xcite .",
    "these fast calculations enabled many iterations , and hence the exploration of some of the generic aspects of junction geometries . due to",
    "weakly confining potentials at ion channel intersections , the effect of gaps can not be neglected , and therefore , re - optimisation of the structure in the presence of the gaps is essential .",
    "the geometries obtained from the first optimisation served as starting points for the second , in which electric potentials generated by three - dimensional structures including gaps were computed using the finite element method ( fem ) @xcite . in a multi - objective optimisation process ,",

    "we fixed the ratio @xmath44 to an optimised value for a specific pseudopotential curvature in the transverse directions , and used the geometric degrees of freedom in the vicinity of the junction to suppress barriers .",
    "we chose the value @xmath47 , which maximises the curvature of the rf field in the transverse plane and additionally leads to the trapping depth of 95% of the maximum achievable one at a given trapping height ( table  [ table : opti_quadchanel ] ) .",
    "we chose the trapping height to be @xmath48  700  @xmath49 m , and hence , the width of the rf electrodes @xmath50  1400  @xmath49 m and their separation @xmath51  580  @xmath49 m .",

    "bridges formed by merging the tips of rf electrodes at the centre cause extremely high pseudopotential barries .",
    "this situation is opposed to junctions in three - dimensional electrode geomeries , e.g. , the one demonstrated in @xcite , where rf bridges were located symmetrically above and below the ion channel .",
