    "sax j1808.43658 ( sax j1808 in the following ) was the first neutron star transient during whose outbursts coherent pulsations were detected ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "this source , together with six other low mass transients ( see wijnands 2005 for a review ) , form a separate ( sub-)class within neutron star transients ( see campana et al .",
    "1998a for a review ) .",
    "distinctive properties , besides coherent pulsations , are weaker outburst peak luminosities ( @xmath0 ) , very low mass companions ( mass functions @xmath1 ) , short orbital periods ( @xmath2 hr ) , very faint quiescent luminosities ( @xmath3 ) and absence of a soft x  ray spectral component in quiescence .    a further difference with respect to ` classical ' neutron star transients concerns the return to quiescence following an outburst .",
    "the best light curve to date of ` classical ' neutron star transients is represented by bepposax observations of aql x-1 ( campana et al .",
    "1998b ) . below a luminosity level of @xmath4 aql",
    "x-1 turned off with an exponential decay with an @xmath5folding time of @xmath6 d. the source then remained quiescent for at least one month following the 1998 outburst ( campana et al .",
    "1998b ) and for five months following the 2000 outburst ( rutledge et al . 2001 ; campana & stella 2003 ) .",
    "the return to quiescence for transient pulsating neutron stars has been monitored for sax j1808 ( wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ; wijnands 2005 ) and for xte j1751305 ( markwardt et al . 2002 ) and swift j1756.92508 ( krimm et al .",
    "the behaviour of the latter two sources was somewhat similar to aql x-1 with a fast decay , even though in the case of xte j1751305 there was still activity 15 d after the transition to quiescence had occurred ( according to rxte / pca , corresponding to a 0.510 kev unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath7 for a source distance of 7 kpc ) . in case of sax",
    "j1808 the decay was completely different from that observed in aql x-1 .",
    "the most striking feature is the strong erratic variability by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "this erratic behaviour was not concentrated in the first few weeks after turn off but lasted for months ( e.g. wjinands et al .",
    "the most likely explanation for this behaviour comes from the similarities with dwarf novae where a similar behaviour has been observed ( kato et al . 2004 ; patterson et al . 2002 ) and to a lesser extent in black hole transients ( kuulkers , howell & van paradijs 1996 ) . in the case of dwarf novae",
    "this has been interpreted as due to a combination of short orbital period and low mass ratio ( osaki & meyer 2002 ; truss et al .",
    "2002 ; campana et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "here we report on a monitoring campaign carried out with swift , following the 2005 outburst . at variance with previous monitoring with rxte / pca we are able to follow the source down to very low levels , a factor of @xmath9 fainter than before , close to quiescence . in sect .",
    "2 we discuss the data and their analysis . sect .",
    "3 contains our discussion and conclusions .",
    "swift carried out 23 observations of sax j1808 between jun 17 , 2005 and oct 28 , 2005 .",
    "xrt collected a total of 4899 s data in window timing ( wt ) mode and 72922 s data in photon counting mode ( see table 1 ) . in wt mode a 1d image is obtained reading data compressing along the central 200 pixels in a single raw .",
    "pc mode produces standard 2d images ( for more details see hill et al .",
    "wt data were mainly collected during the early stages of the outburst when the source was brighter .",
    "pc data collected during this period are piled - up .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      at lower luminosities the number of collected photons is very small and we have to stack together different observations .",
    "one important consideration comes from the observation that 8 out of 13 observations found the source with a count rate in the narrow interval @xmath10 c ks@xmath11 , whereas the other 5 all lie within @xmath12 c ks@xmath11 .",
    "the mean of the first group is @xmath13 c ks@xmath11 and of the second is @xmath14 c ks@xmath11 .",
    "this is rather peculiar and hints for the existence of two different states in the deep faint end tail of the outburst . due to the small number of photons",
    "these spectra can be easily fit with single power law models . for state",
    "a we derive a photon index of @xmath15 and a mean unabsorbed 0.310 kev luminosity of @xmath16 , for state b we have @xmath17 and a luminosity of @xmath18 .",
    "these values have been derived binning the data to 5 photons per energy bin and applying the churazov weighting in the fitting procedure ( see fig .",
    "this indicates that state b is not yet the true quiescent state , characterized by a single power law spectrum with index @xmath19 and a source luminosity of @xmath20 ( heinke et al .",
    "2007 ) , i.e. a factor of @xmath21 smaller that state b luminosity . assuming this power law component as a stable component ( at least in photon index ) present in state a and b spectra",
    ", one can investigate if a black body component is present .",
    "fitting state a spectrum with a fixed power law photon index ( with @xmath22 ) and a free black body component , we derive @xmath23 kev and a radius of @xmath24 km .",
    "the improvement over the simple power law fit is at a level of @xmath25 by means of an f - test . for state b",
    "we are not able to constrain the black body component . however",
    ", if we assume the same black body temperature as in state a ( i.e. 0.2 kev ) we can derive an upper limit on its radius of @xmath26 km , indicating that if present and at the same temperature it must be smaller in size .",
    "sax j1808 is the prototype of the accreting millisecond x  ray pulsar ( amp ) class .",
    "the source underwent several outbursts to date which have been monitored in great details thanks to rxte observations ( wijnands 2005 ; wijnands et al .",
    "these observations however were limited to the brightest part of the outburst , being the pca on rxte a collimated instrument ( and therefore heavily background limited ) . here",
    "we report on the first campaign aimed at studying the faintest tail of the outburst and return to quiescence .",
    "thanks to the fast repointing and flexible scheduling capabilities of the swift satellite , we monitored the return to quiescence of sax j1808 during the 2006 outburst .",
    "the bright phase of the outburst is similar to what has been observed in the past : following the peak and the smooth decay a flaring behaviour sets in with at least three rebrightening episodes .",
    "after this the source turns to quiescence even if same low level activity ( factor of @xmath27 ) is still present .",
    "the puzzling result of this observational campaign on sax j1808 is that out of 13 observations with luminosity below @xmath28 , 8 times the source was found with a luminosity around @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , i.e. at a luminosity level @xmath30 times higher than the true quiescent level ( campana et al . 2002 ; heinke et al .",
    "2007 ) . given the wild luminosity variations this is somewhat strange and calls for the presence of a ` metastable ' state .",
    "this luminosity level is difficult to interpret in case of standard disk accretion but finds a natural explanation if the accretion process is mediated by the magnetic field of the fast spinning neutron star .",
    "when the magnetospheric radius ( i.e. the radius at which the neutron star magnetic field starts controlling the accretion flow ) is larger than the corotation radius , the system is in the ( so - called ) propeller regime . in this case matter is halted from the rotating magnetosphere and does not accrete onto the neutron star surface ( see e.g. campana & stella 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "when the magnetospheric radius becomes larger than the light cylinder radius ( @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the velocity of light and @xmath33 the spin period ) , the magnetic field can not corotate any more with the neutron star and a dipole losses will take place . the luminosity range spanned in the propeller regime",
    "is @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the spin period in units of 2.5 ms and @xmath36 the neutron star mass in units of @xmath37 ; see campana & stella 2000 ) . in order to have the",
    "` metastable ' state to coincide with the lowest luminosity in the propeller regime ( i.e. just before the reactivation of the pulsar ) , we have to require a magnetic field of @xmath38 g , in line with previous estimates : @xmath39 g using disk - magnetosphere interaction models ( psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) , @xmath40 g using simple considerations on the position of the magnetospheric radius during quiescent periods ( di salvo & burderi 2003 ) ; @xmath41 g modelling period changes during outbursts with a magnetic torque model ( hartman et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the lowest luminosity level in the proposed interpretation is ascribed to the interaction of a turned - on pulsar with the interbinary and circumstellar environment .",
    "variability is expected at this stage due to the rapidly changing environment as observed , e.g. , in the millisecond radio pulsar psr j17405340 ( damico et al . 2001 ; ferrario et al .",
    "2001 ) which gets eclipsed over a range of orbital phases for different orbital cycles ."
