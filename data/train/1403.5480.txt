    "the direct photons from relativistic heavy - ion collisions are expected to be a valuable probe of the collision dynamics at early times and to provide information on the characteristics of the initially created parton - hadron matter once the final state hadronic decay photons are subtracted from the experimental spectra  @xcite . in the last years , the phenix collaboration  @xcite has measured the spectra of the photons produced in minimal bias au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev and found a strong elliptic flow @xmath10 of direct photons , which is comparable to that of the produced pions .",
    "since direct photons were expected to be essentially produced in the initial hot medium before the collective flow has developed , this observation was in contrast to the theoretical expectations and predictions @xcite .",
    "also more recent studies employing event - by - event hydrodynamical calculations  @xcite severely have underestimated the elliptic flow of direct photons and alternative sources of direct photons from the conformal anomaly have been suggested  @xcite .    on the other hand , in refs .",
    "@xcite we have proposed that apart from the partonic production channels the direct photon yield and primarily the strong @xmath11 might be due to hadronic sources ( such as meson - meson bremsstrahlung or hadronic interactions as @xmath1 , @xmath2 etc . ) . indeed , the interacting hadrons carry a large @xmath11 and contribute by more than 50% to the measured direct photons in minimum bias collisions at rhic according to the phsd calculations in ref .",

    "@xcite ) . for a quantitative understanding of the direct photon production",
    "it is important to verify the decomposition of the total photon yield according to the production sources : the late hadron decays ( the cocktail ) , hadronic interactions beyond the cocktail ( during the collision phase ) and the partonic interactions in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . since previous transport studies have indicated that the duration of the partonic phase substantially decreases with increasing impact parameter @xcite we will study here explicitly the centrality dependence of the direct photon yield together with the essential production channels and their impact on the photon @xmath11 .    as in ref .  @xcite we will employ the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach to investigate the photon production in au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev at various centralities thus extending the previous investigations for the case of minimum bias collisions ( see also @xcite .",
    "we recall that the phsd approach has provided a consistent description of the bulk properties of heavy - ion collisions ",
    "rapidity spectra , transverse mass distributions , azimuthal asymmetries of various particle species  from low super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) to top relativistic - heavy - ion - collider ( rhic ) energies @xcite and was successfully used also for the analysis of dilepton production from hadronic and partonic sources at sps , rhic and large - hadron - collider ( lhc ) energies  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to calculate also the photon production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions from hadronic and partonic interactions within the phsd transport approach , since its microscopic and non - equilibrium evolution of the nucleus - nucleus collision is independently controlled by a multitude of other hadronic and electromagnetic observables in a wide energy range  @xcite .",
    "for the details on the phsd approach we refer the reader to refs . @xcite and the implementation of the photon production to refs .",
    "@xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "let us recall that the dynamical calculations within the phsd for dileptons agree with the dilepton rate emitted by the thermalized qcd medium as calculated in lattice qcd ( lqcd )  @xcite .",
    "we note , additionally , that the electric conductivity of the qgp from the phsd , which controls the photon emission rate in equilibrium , is rather well in line with available lqcd results @xcite .    as sources of photon production - on top of the general dynamical evolution - we consider hadronic  @xcite as well as partonic  @xcite interactions . in the present study",
    "we extend the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite by adding an additional source of photons , i.e. the bremsstrahlung in elastic meson+baryon collisions ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this process is calculated within the soft photon approximation for charged hadrons in analogy to the treatment of photon production by the meson+meson bremsstrahlung in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since a new production mechanism has been added to the hadronic production channels , we first check whether this addition does not lead to an overestimation of the data from the phenix collaboration  @xcite in minimal bias @xmath12 collisions in fig .",
    "[ mb ] ( l.h.s . ) . since the decays of mesons as late hadronic sources are less sensitive to the creation of the hot and dense medium and to its properties , they are usually subtracted experimentally from the total photon yield to access the ` direct ' photon spectrum . in our calculations of the direct photon spectrum in fig .",
    "[ mb ] ( l.h.s . )",
    "the following sources are taken into account : the decays of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons ; the reactions @xmath15 , @xmath16 ; the photon bremsstrahlung in meson - meson and meson - baryon collisions @xmath17 , @xmath4 ; photon production in the qgp in the processes @xmath18 , and @xmath19 as well as the photon production in the initial hard collisions ( `` pqcd '' ) , which is given by the hard photon yield in p+p collisions scaled with the number of binary collisions @xmath20 .",
    "we find that our phsd calculations are in a reasonable agreement with the phenix data  @xcite and show a clear dominance of the hadronic production channels over the partonic channels for transverse momenta below about 0.7 gev / c .",
    "in particular , the bremsstrahlung contributions are responsible for the banana shape spectrum and the strong increase for low @xmath21 . accordingly , especially experimental data well below 1 gev / c in @xmath21 will be helpful in disentangling the various sources .",
    "we have , furthermore , calculated the produced photons as a function of the number of participants @xmath22 .",
    "integrating the thermal photon spectra - defined by the partonic radiation channels and the hadronic non - decay contributions - over the transverse momentum @xmath21 in the interval @xmath23gev / c , we obtain the number of thermal photons as a function of centrality , which is plotted in fig .  1 ( r.h.s . )",

    "since only binary collision channels contribute to the production of thermal photons in our approach , their yield rises faster than @xmath22 .",
    "a power - law fit to our results gives approximately a scaling @xmath24 with @xmath8 1.5 .",
    "in addition we display in fig .  1 ( r.h.s . ) the scaling with @xmath22 for the partonic ( full dots ) and hadronic bremsstrahlung channels ( full triangles ) separately , which give exponents of @xmath25 1.75 and @xmath25 1.5 , respectively .    as one might have expected the contribution of the photons from the qgp is larger in central collisions in phsd while the hadronic sources contribute more dominantly in peripheral collisions .",

    "@xcite , the phsd approach predicts a very small @xmath11 of photons produced in the initial hot deconfined phase by partonic channels of the order of 2% .",
    "the spectra of direct and thermal photons - as produced in au - au collisions at @xmath0  gev - have been calculated differentially in collision centrality within the phsd transport approach , which has been previously tested in comparison to the measured spectra and flow of photons in minimal bias collisions at the same energy  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the channel decomposition of the photon spectra changes with centrality providing a larger contribution of the hadronic sources in more peripheral collisions . as a consequence ,",
    "the direct photon @xmath11 is larger in peripheral collisions as compared to the most central reactions .",
    "this is due to the much smaller elliptic flow of the photons from the hot deconfined matter in the early stages of the collision relative to the @xmath11 from final hadrons within our approach .",
    "the increase of the direct photon @xmath11 with decreasing centrality for the two most central bins has been also indicated in hydrodynamics calculations in refs .",
