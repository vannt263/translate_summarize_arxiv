    "we find that @xmath298% of long duration grbs should occur in the low - redshift ( @xmath299 ) universe .",
    "in this work , we considered whether the differences between the pre-  and  redshift distributions can be explained with a physical model for grbs that takes into account the different flux thresholds of grb detectors .",
    "the model presented here parameterizes the jet opening angle distribution for an assumed flat @xmath31 spectrum , and finds best fit values for the @xmath13-ray energy release for different functional forms of the comoving rate density of grbs , assuming that the properties of grbs do not change with time . adopting the uniform jet model",
    ", we assumed that the energy per solid angle is roughly constant within a well - defined jet opening angle .",
    "the pre-  redshift sample suggests that the range of the jet opening angle is between @xmath300 and @xmath131 radians .",
    "we explored three different ranges of jet opening angle with @xmath301 , and @xmath257 , @xmath131 , and @xmath302 radians .    the results in   3",

    "a good fit was only possible , however , by modifying the hopkins & beacom sfr to provide positive evolution of the sfr history of grbs to high redshifts ( sfr5 and sfr6 ; see fig .",

    "the results of our fitting therefore indicate that grb activity was greater in the past and is not simply proportional to the bulk of the star formation as traced by the blue and uv luminosity density of the universe .",
    "this is contrary to the conclusion of @xcite based upon a study of batse size distribution and a small number of grbs with known redshifts in the pre - swift era .",
    "they obtain worse fits for sfrs that increase at high redshift .",
    "the batse analysis of @xcite gives results that are consistent with the required monotonically increasing grb sfr that we find .",
    "@xcite also conclude that a rising grb sfr is implied , and also note that the star formation rate can not increase in proportion to greater past grb activity , as this would result in overproduction of metals .",
    "changes in the progenitor population or grb properties , for example , due to changing metallicities with time , might account for the large number of high - redshift grbs observed with swift , but this would introduce a large number of unconstrained parameters .",
    "moreover , one would then have to explain why the amati and ghirlanda correlations relating spectral properties and energy releases are insensitive to redshift .",
    "assuming that the grb properties do not change with time , we therefore find that the grb source rate density must display positive evolution to at least @xmath165 .",
    "why would grb activity be greater in the past ?",
    "one possibility suggested by recent studies @xcite on the metallicities of host galaxies of grbs is that grbs derive from progenitor stars with a lower metallicity than the progenitors of type ii sne . in this case",
    ", one might expect that the peak of grb activity would occur earlier in the universe than during the peak of star formation activity at @xmath305  3 .",
    "nevertheless , the high - redshift fraction of grbs detected with swift will test the validity of sfr5 and sfr6 used to model the grb data .",
    "the models that fit the data imply that 8  12% of swift grbs occur at @xmath165 , in accord with the data as shown in figure  [ fig23 ] .",

    "if no grb with @xmath306 is detected by the time @xmath307 swift grbs with measured redshifts are found , then we may conclude that the grb formation rate has begun to decline above @xmath308 .",
    "by contrast , if a few @xmath309 grbs have been detected within the next year or two with swift , then this would be in accord with our model and would support the conjecture of @xcite that a second episode of population i and ii star formation took place at @xmath165 , possibly even including some grbs that originate from population iii stars .",
    "our model parameters suggest that grbs can be detected with swift to a maximum redshift @xmath310 , even given the limits placed on the range of jet angles , in particular , @xmath311 .",
    "the relationship between the galaxies that host grbs and their metallicities remains controversial , with evidence for high - redshift , low - metallicity grb host galaxies @xcite countered by examples of grbs found in galaxies with moderate metallicity @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that 5 grbs , or several per cent of the grb population with known redshifts , are found at low ( @xmath312 ) redshift in galaxies that have very low metallicity compared with solar metallicity and with the distribution of metallicities of low - redshift galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey . in 4 out of the 5 low-@xmath0 grbs ,",
    "the apparent isotropic energy release of these grbs is much smaller than @xmath313 ergs , and so these grbs are unrepresentative of typical long duration grbs .",

    "0.2% of the  classical \" grbs should be detected at low redshifts.% can be estimated by considering the fractional volume within @xmath315 compared with @xmath316 , and that the sfr activity at @xmath317 was a factor @xmath318 greater than at @xmath319 . ]",
    "these low - redshift grbs may also belong to a completely distinct population of grbs compared to their high - redshift counterparts , as also suggested by the differing luminosity functions of the two populations @xcite .",

    "although we have restricted our treatment to the long - duration , soft - spectrum class of grbs , the separation between the short hard and long soft class of grbs is not distinct .",
    "moreover , recent observations of nearby grbs show that the nearby ( @xmath320 ) grb 060614 , a long duration grb in terms of its light curve @xcite , lacks a supernova excess @xcite , does not fit neatly into either the short hard or long soft classes @xcite , and could represent a separate population of grbs @xcite .",
