    "monolayer and bilayer graphene are semimetals with good conducting properties @xcite . moreover , in the presence of a microwave field the related optical conductivity is constant over a large regime of frequencies .",
    "this has been found in theoretical calculations @xcite and was also observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the existence of at least two bands in both materials , where at fermi energy @xmath0 ( i.e. graphene without a gate potential ) the lower band is occupied and the upper band is unoccupied . as consequence ,",
    "the absorption of photons of energy @xmath1 from the microwave field creates electron - holes pairs due to the excitation of electrons from the lower band at energy @xmath2 to the unoccupied upper band at energy @xmath3 .",
    "this mechanism applies also to gated graphene which has a shifted fermi energy @xmath4 .",
    "however , in this case photons can only be absorbed if @xmath5 ( for @xmath6 ) , since all the states in the upper band are occupied up to the energy @xmath7 .",
    "correspondingly , a photon can only be absorbed for @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",
    "this means that electron - hole creation by a microwave field is only possible if @xmath10    it has been found in a number of recent experiments that the creation of a gap in the semimetallic band structure of monolayer graphene ( mlg ) is possible by absorption of hydrogen @xcite or in bilayer graphene ( blg ) by applying a double gate @xcite . in both cases an electron - holes pair",
    "can also be created but this requires a photon energy larger than the band gap @xmath11 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ paircreation ] ) .    once electron - holes pairs have been created they will contribute to a current in the material , where the latter is related to the strength of the external microwave field by the optical conductivity @xmath12 .",
    "this quantity can be measured experimentally and characterizes the electronic properties of the material .",
    "in particular , it can be used to determine the band gap @xmath11 , since it vanishes for @xmath13 .",
    "blg , in contrast to mlg , has two low- and two high - energy bands . as a result",
    ", there are several gaps that lead to electron - hole pair creations on different energy scales with a more complex behavior of the optical conductivity @xcite .    in the following the optical conductivity",
    "shall be evaluated via the kubo formalism for the low - energy bands in mlg and blg at nonzero temperature @xmath14 .",
    "this avoids electron - hole pair creation from higher energy bands and van hove singularities .",
    "an important question in this context is the role of the low - energy quasiparticle spectrum on the optical conductivity . in order to focus on simple spectral properties , we consider only non - interacting electrons in a periodic tight - binding model .",

    "such a measurement can be performed as an optical transmission experiment @xcite because the optical conductivity is related to the transmittance @xmath14 through the relation @xmath42 the parameter @xmath43 is the speed of light . then graphene is completely transparent for photonic energies up to the gap energy .",
    "this could be used to filter light with frequencies higher than the one given by the gap energy .",
    "our model assumption of taking into account only the low - energy bands of blg restricts the photon energies @xmath44 to less than @xmath45ev , which is the gap between the low - energy and the high - energy bands in blg @xcite .",
    "this restriction also avoids stronger deviations from the dirac theory of mlg and van hove singularities .",
