    "recently , much attention has been paid to hybrid systems composed of superconducting ( sc ) circuits and neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic sc devices with the submicrometer - sized josephson junctions ( jj ) possess the advantages of rapid operation ( @xmath0 ) , scalability , design flexibility , and tunability , but the disadvantage of short relaxation and dephasing times ( @xmath1 )  @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the microscopic atomic systems maintain the quantum coherence over long time ( @xmath2 ) and can be engineered precisely , but they operate slowly ( @xmath3 ) and have limited scalability  @xcite . the hybrid systems combined of these two different components have the prospect of rapidly manipulating quantum states and long - time storage of quantum information .    for the transmission of quantum states , the atomic system needs to be entangled with the sc circuits . linking both components with a quantum bus , i.e. , a coplanar waveguide resonator ,",
    "the sc circuits and atoms are indirectly coupled by the electromagnetic field of the resonator  @xcite . besides",
    ", the atomic system can also directly talk to the sc circuits via the magnetic dipole interaction  @xcite . despite a large number of various proposals for the hybrid systems ,",
    "the relevant experimental progress is slow .",
    "especially , the direct interface between sc circuits and neutral atoms is still challenging .    for resonant coupling to the solid - state devices",
    ", the atomic system should be selected accordingly . in principle",
    ", the operating frequency of sc circuits can be matched to the ground - state hyperfine splittings of alkali atoms . in this case",
    "the magnetic dipole moment of the atomic system is extremely small , resulting in a weak interface between subsystems .",
    "the coupling can be @xmath4 enhanced by replacing single atom with an atomic ensemble  @xcite , where @xmath5 is the number of atoms .",
    "however , a dense quantum gas causes new issues , such as the atomic number fluctuations and interparticle interactions , making the experimental implementation ambitious .",
    "rb atom is placed inside the gate capacitor @xmath6 and couples to the electric field @xmath7 between two parallel identical plates with an area @xmath8 and a separation @xmath9 .",
    "the gate capacitance of the empty capacitor ( without the extra atom ) is @xmath10 af and the corresponding empty charging energy is @xmath11 ghz .",
    "the self - capacitance of the josephson junction is chosen to be @xmath12 af and the josephson energy is set to @xmath13 ghz with the corresponding critical current @xmath14 na .",

    "unlike the direct - coupled systems relying on the magnetic dipole interactions  @xcite , our system is completely based on the direct electric - dipole interaction between the macroscopic and microscopic quantum systems .",
    "this scheme has two advantages : for one thing , the energy separation between two highly excited atomic states can be reduced to hundreds or even tens of ghz , which enables the effective driving by the electromagnetic field at a microwave frequency ; for another , the electric - dipole allowed transition between two rydberg states leads to a large electric dipole moment , which ensures the strong interaction between these two qubits .",
    "our investigation illustrates that the direct electric - dipole coupling in the hybrid system results in a strong interqubit entanglement .",
    "the quantum - state control is achieved via linearly sweeping the gate voltage , leading to a universal two - qubit gate .",
    "we consider a cooper - pair box ( cpb ) composed of a sc island connected to a sc reservoir via a tunnel junction with a self - capacitance @xmath19  @xcite as shown in fig .",

    "we consider @xmath6 as a parallel - plate capacitor with the plate area @xmath21 and the interplate distance @xmath22 . for a common cpb ( without coupling to an extra atom ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian including the electrostatic energy , the work done by the voltage source , and the tunneling energy of the cooper pairs is expressed as @xmath23 with the coulomb energy of a single cooper pair on the island @xmath24 , the number operator of excess cooper pairs in the box @xmath5 , the offset charge @xmath25 , the josephson energy @xmath26 , and the phase drop across the junction @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath29 is the magnetic flux quantum , @xmath30 is the planck constant , and @xmath31 is the critical current of the jj .    in the charge representation , the hilbert space associated with the sc circuit",
    "is spanned by the eigenstates @xmath32 of the number operator @xmath5 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . at temperatures",
    "such that @xmath35 , we can restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath36 , for which one further obtains the charge - qubit hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath37 where the pauli matrices @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ hc2 ] ) indicates that the excess cooper - pair number @xmath5 undergoes a rabi oscillation between 0 and 1 with a frequency of @xmath40 and an amplitude of @xmath41 .",
    "the electric field @xmath7 between two parallel plates of the gate capacitor is derived as @xmath42 with @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that @xmath7 consists of a constant component proportional to @xmath44 and an oscillatory component associated with @xmath5 .",
    "the latter can be used to drive another rabi oscillation of a two - level atom with a transition frequency @xmath45 nearly equal to @xmath46 .",

    "we assume a single atom is placed inside the gate capacitor @xmath6 and couples to the electric field @xmath7 ( see fig .",

    "the electric field @xmath7 is then given by @xmath54 where the electric - field amplitude @xmath55 .",
    "as one can see , an extra component associated with the induced electric - dipole moment @xmath53 appears in @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the relevant @xmath6-dependent coulomb energy @xmath56 and gate charge bias @xmath57 in the hamiltonian  ( [ hc1 ] ) are rewritten as @xmath58 where the charging energy constant @xmath59 and the charge bias @xmath60 corresponding to the empty gate capacitance @xmath61 .",
    "we consider the single - atom dielectric composed of two atomic states @xmath62 ( lower ) and @xmath63 ( upper ) with the electric dipole - allowed transition frequency @xmath45 .",
    "using the @xmath64-component pauli matrix @xmath65 , the atomic polarization operator is written as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the electric dipole moment and the direction of the electric field @xmath7 is chosen as the quantization axis .",
    "the hamiltonian for the single atom is expressed as @xmath68 with the @xmath69-component pauli matrix @xmath70 and the rabi frequency @xmath71 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the whole hybrid system is given by @xmath72 with the corresponding hilbert space spanned by the orthonormal basis @xmath73 .",
    "in the limit of @xmath74 , we arrive at a direct - coupled system composed of a charge qubit and an atomic qubit .",

    "the corresponding electric dipole moment is given by @xmath93  @xcite , where @xmath94 is the bohr radius , leading to the rabi frequency @xmath95 ghz .",
    "we should note that the effect of other atomic transitions associated with @xmath96 and @xmath97 can be neglected due to the off - resonant one- and two - photon transitions and the weak - field couplings .",
    "in addition , the fine - structure interaction of @xmath97 , which is of the order of a few ghz  @xcite , is much smaller compared with the strong cpb - atom coupling .",
    "moreover , in a cryogenic environment the radiative lifetimes of @xmath96 and @xmath97 are 25.3 @xmath98 and 67.2 @xmath98  @xcite , respectively , which are long enough for coherently interfacing the cpb and the atom .",
    "the coupling is in principle switchable by coherently transferring two rydberg states to the hyperfine ground states via the standard spectroscopic techniques , extending the coherence time of atomic qubit  @xcite .",
    "the investigated coherent dynamics of hybrid system is within a time scale smaller than the decoherence time of charge qubit ( see below ) .",
    "we show in fig .  [ fig2 ] the dependence of the eigenenergies @xmath77 on the offset charge @xmath81 which is tuned from 0 to 1 by the gate voltage @xmath20 .",
    "it is seen that the whole energy structure consists of two sets of the charge - qubit - like spectra with the josephson - tunneling - induced anti - crossings labeled as @xmath83 , whose energy spacings are approximately equal to @xmath99 at @xmath85 . besides , two other avoided crossings labeled as @xmath84 occur between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we find that @xmath84 are located at @xmath86 and @xmath102 , respectively , and the energy spacings are approximately equal to @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , we have labeled the eigenstates @xmath78 at several specific @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . at @xmath88 ,",

    "in particular , at @xmath113 , we find that the system is almost in the charge superposition states of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "+      from @xmath78 , one can also derive the expectation values of the excess number of cooper pairs in the box , @xmath116 , as shown in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) behaves like a usual charge qubit , i.e. , monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) from 0 ( 1 ) to 1 ( 0 )  @xcite , while @xmath119 exhibit the opposed oscillatory behavior . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b and c , we display the average atomic populations in @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath120 . passing through either avoided crossing @xmath84",
    ", the atom flips between @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the bands of @xmath121 and @xmath122 while the corresponding cooper - pair number varies abruptly , which indicates the energy exchange between the charge and atomic qubits and strong interqubit entanglement .",
    "by contrast , in the bands of @xmath123 and @xmath124 the atom mainly stays in @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , meaning weak entanglement between two qubits .",
    "we use the concurrence @xmath125 to measure the entanglement  @xcite of the two - qubit system in different bands ( see fig .  [ fig3]d ) . as expected for the bands @xmath123 and @xmath124",
    ", @xmath126 indicate that the atom weakly couples to the charge qubit and @xmath127 can be approximately written as product states .",
    "contrarily , the charge and atomic qubits are strongly entangled in @xmath128 corresponding to the bands @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "around @xmath84 we obtain @xmath129 , i.e. , the maximal interqubit entanglement , which corresponds to the strong charge - number variation ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) and the atomic population - flipping ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b and c ) .",
    "to enable transitions between different qubit states , we sweep the hybrid system through the avoided crossings , similar to the landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) interferometry  @xcite . as an example",
    ", we numerically perform a single - passage sweep with the system initially prepared in @xmath130 by linearly varying the offset charge @xmath81 ( via changing the gate voltage @xmath20 ) from 0 to 1 with a constant rate @xmath131 , and check the probabilities @xmath132 of finding the system in different @xmath133 .    for our hybrid system , sweeping the system through the avoided crossings @xmath84",
    "is related to the lzs interferometry in a single sc qubit , where the quantum system is swept through the same single anti - crossing twice  @xcite .",
    "analogous to an optical mach - zehnder interferometer , two anticrossings @xmath84 act like two beamsplitters . at @xmath134 ,",
    "the entrance state is split into two , which travel along two paths @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "afterwards , those two states are combined together at @xmath135 and interfere with each other .",
    "nevertheless , we should point out that our coupled system is significantly different from the usual lzs interferometry performed on a single sc qubit . due to the avoided crossings",
    "@xmath83 , the adiabatic states of two paths @xmath100 and @xmath101 are not restricted to two states @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "thus , the conventional analysis based on the two - state landau - zener model is not suitable .",
    "we numerically solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation and plot the results in fig .",
    "it is seen that the final state of the system strongly depends on the sweep rate @xmath131 . in the limit of @xmath138 ,",
    "the system at @xmath108 is mainly in @xmath139 , which indicates that the coupled system follows the path @xmath100 adiabatically . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b with a sweep rate @xmath140 ns@xmath141 , at the anti - crossing @xmath134 , the system has a high probability in @xmath137 and then transits to the superposition state @xmath142 at @xmath85 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the system is transfered to @xmath139 at the anticrossing @xmath135 .    as @xmath131 approaches the energy separation @xmath143 , the system state at @xmath108 displays an oscillation between @xmath139 and @xmath144 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) , which results from the interference between two paths of @xmath100 and @xmath101 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]c with a sweep rate @xmath145 ns@xmath141 , at @xmath84 the state transformation of the system is not distinct .",

    "the system can non - adiabatically pass though the anti - crossings @xmath84 .",
    "finally , for @xmath147 ns@xmath141 , the system is mainly in @xmath136 , indicating the system non - adiabatically passes though the avoided crossing @xmath148 .",
    "+      naturally , this hybrid system is also applicable for quantum computation  @xcite . as an illustration",
    ", we consider the implementation of the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate  @xcite , where the atomic and charge qubits play the roles of control and target , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4]d , the concrete operation is demonstrated according to the following steps : ( 1 ) initially , the offset charge @xmath81 is set to be zero .",
    "two light pulses are applied on the two - photon transition between @xmath62 and an auxiliary state @xmath149 , for instance , @xmath150 , so as to completely transfer the occupation in @xmath62 ( if any ) to @xmath149  @xcite .",

    "( 3 ) @xmath81 is swept adiabatically back to zero and afterwards the two - photon transition between @xmath62 and @xmath149 is applied again to transfer the atom in @xmath149 back to @xmath62 .    for",
    "the system initially prepared in @xmath136 ( @xmath139 ) at @xmath88 , the step ( 1 ) does not affect the state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4]d ) . in step",
    "( 2 ) , the system adiabatically evolves to @xmath142 ( @xmath151 ) and then transits to @xmath151 ( @xmath142 ) via the raman process .",
    "finally , the system adiabatically moves to @xmath139 ( @xmath136 ) after step ( 3 ) .",
    "by contrast , for the system initially prepared in @xmath144 or @xmath137 , step ( 1 ) brings the system in a space spanned by @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which are uncoupled to any @xmath133 due to the optical - frequency separation .",
    "in addition , the raman transition in step ( 2 ) does not take effect , and the system still stay in its original state after the whole operation .",
    "therefore , the cnot operation is executed .",
    "for our strongly - coupled system , the finite lifetimes of two atomic states and the relaxation and dephasing of superconducting circuit limit the coherent interaction between two different quantum subsystems .",
    "although the rydberg states are characterized by their extremely large electric dipole moments and relatively long lifetimes ( typically , tens of @xmath154s ) , they are not ideal candidates for storing quantum information . the rydberg atom can work as an intermediate qubit to achieve the strong inter - qubit entanglement and implement the two - qubit logic gates within a time scale much shorter than the rydberg - state lifetimes .",
    "after the quantum control operations , one can map two rydberg states onto two hyperfine ground states which are usually employed for long - time storage of quantum states  @xcite .    due to the strong coupling to the environment ,",
    "the superconducting circuits suffer from the short relaxation time @xmath155 and dephasing time @xmath156 . for the common charge qubit ,",
    "the dominant @xmath157 noise in background charge damps the quantum coherent dynamics of cooper pairs on the island after about 10 ns  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the gate operation times are shorter than the decoherence time of superconducting circuit , the relaxation and dephasing of charge qubit hardly affect the system dynamics .",
    "for our strongly - coupled system , the qubit control can be performed well within 1 ns ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) .",
    "moreover , the two - qubit logic gates ( fig.[fig4]d ) can be also implemented in a similar time scale .",
    "in summary , we have investigated a hybrid system composed of a charge qubit and an atomic qubit .",
    "the oscillation of the excess cooper pairs in the box varies the internal electric field of the gate capacitor and further directly drives the rotation of the atomic qubit .",
    "the strong interqubit coupling is achieved by choosing the atomic electric - dipole transition between two rydberg states with a frequency spacing that is nearly resonant with the operating frequency of the sc circuit . as a result",
    ", we obtain strong entanglement between two different kinds of qubits .",
    "the quantum states of this two - qubit system can be controlled by sweeping the gate voltage with different rates . moreover ,",
    "universal two - qubit logic gates can be implemented , showing the potential for quantum state transfer and computation . in this work , we have assumed an ideal cpb in the absence of decoherence sources , which is valid within a time scale shorter than the decoherence times of qubits . in reality ,",
    "due to the strong coupling to the local electromagnetic environment , the quantum dynamics of the charge qubit is strongly influenced by the @xmath157 noise in background charge and critical current  @xcite and even the readout back - action  @xcite , resulting in a short decoherence time . in the future study",
    ", we will investigate how the external noise affects the implementation of quantum state control on this hybrid system .",

    "<S> we investigate a novel hybrid system of a superconducting charge qubit interacting directly with a single neutral atom via electric dipole coupling . </S>",
    "<S> interfacing of the macroscopic superconducting circuit with the microscopic atomic system is accomplished by varying the gate capacitance of the charge qubit . to achieve strong interaction , </S>",
    "<S> we employ two rydberg states with an electric - dipole - allowed transition , which alters the polarizability of the dielectric medium of the gate capacitor . </S>",
    "<S> sweeping the gate voltage with different rates leads to a precise control of hybrid quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show a possible implementation of a universal two - qubit gate . </S>"
