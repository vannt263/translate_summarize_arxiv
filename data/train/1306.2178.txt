    "use of the ads / cft correspondence@xcite has provided us with a remarkably powerful set of techniques to address strong coupling dynamics of certain gauge theories . over the years",
    "it has become possible to capture some qualitative but key features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which so far has eluded the standard lore of conventional field theory methods .    in this article",
    "we will discuss one such aspect : the physics of the chiral symmetry breaking within the flavour sector of a large @xmath6 gauge theory , with the hope that we learn at least qualitatively useful lessons about qcd and therefore the strongly coupled matter created at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "we will rely on a model proposed in @xcite , which we will henceforth refer to as the kuperstein - sonnenschein model .",
    "the standard way of discussing the flavour physics is to introduce a set of probe branes in a particular gravity background which is sourced by some stack of d - branes .",
    "this method was pioneered in @xcite . in the kuperstein - sonnenschein model ,",
    "a pair of probe d7 and anti - d7 brane is placed in the ads@xmath7 background which is popularly known as the klebanov - witten background@xcite .",
    "the probe branes wrap a three cycle inside the internal manifold @xmath8 and extend along the rest of the conifold @xmath9 .",
    "the zero temperature physics of the probes realizes a spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry by having the branes join smoothly in the ir and thus leading to : @xmath10 . in @xcite , we have explored the dynamics of the flavours in this model in the presence of a temperature and an external electro - magnetic field and found an interesting and rich phase structure .",
    "the physics explored in the probe limit teaches us interesting lessons about the dynamics of flavours in such models , however they are also limited by the probe approximation .",
    "it is an interesting question in its own right to consider going beyond this approximation .",
    "such an exercise is also physically relevant for qcd , where the number of colours and the number of flavours are of the same order . to consider back - reaction by the probes on the background geometry",
    ", one has to solve for the equations of motion obtained from an action consisting of supergravity and dirac - born - infeld pieces . typically , to facilitate the technical challenges , such an undertaking",
    "is carried out within the so called  smearing \" approximation , where the probes are smeared along their transverse directions such that the full symmetry of the original background is recovered .",
    "work along this direction has been carried out in @xcite-@xcite in related models and summarized in the review @xcite . however , most of these efforts rely on supersymmetry and become technically simpler than solving the equations of motion .",
    "the kuperstein - sonnenschein model is non - supersymmetric to begin with and thus one needs to consider a system of coupled second order non - linear differential equations to make any progress .",
    "we explored this system of equations in @xcite and found an analytic solution at the leading order in the back - reaction , measured in powers of @xmath11 .    when the flavour back - reaction is taken into account , the underlying conformal theory is deformed by higher dimensional irrelevant operators of dimension @xmath12 and dimension @xmath13 respectively .",
    "furthermore , the gauge coupling runs and the theory acquires a landau pole in the uv : the resulting theory is not uv - complete .",
    "interestingly , these generic properties are very similar to the back - reacted backgrounds which do preserve some supersymmetry . in @xcite",
    "we have also demonstrated that an additional probe sector in this back - reacted background now undergoes a chiral phase transition , which is otherwise absent when the back - reaction vanishes .",
    "this is simply because the landau pole now gives a scale and there is a clear notion of small and large temperature regimes .",
    "let us offer a few more comments .",
    "it is not possible to observe a finite temperature phase transition in a theory whose underlying description is conformal .",
    "however , if one introduces another scale in the system ( other than the temperature ) , as we have explored in @xcite , this possibility opens up .",
    "typically , any such scale is an  infrared property \" of the system since we are probing the system at low energies , _",
    "e.g. _ at room temperatures .",
    "this is often summarized by saying that thermodynamics is an infrared property of a system , which means it does not care about the energy - scales that lie much higher than what is explored in an experimental set - up .    on the other hand , we have an example , demonstrated in @xcite , where such a phase transition happens because the landau pole provides a scale other than the temperature .",
    "the theory is valid well below the landau pole ; and we have shown in @xcite that within the regime of its validity there is now a phase transition . thus the thermodynamics of the system is not quite just an  infrared property \" of the system anymore .",
    "if we had an uv - complete description of the back - reacted system , the landau pole would disappear yielding a more fundamental microscopic description which is not conformal .",
    "thus it is not a surprising fact that a finite temperature phase transition takes place in such a fundamentally non - conformal system .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us remark on a possible limitation of our approach as far as exploring the physics in the flavour sector is concerned .",
    "we will introduce an additional probe sector and discuss the phase structure of this additional probe sector in the back - reacted background .",
    "note , however , that our back - reacted background is obtained by considering back - reaction by the parallel shaped embeddings only .",
    "thus , if we observe a phase transition from the parallel - shaped to the u - shaped embeddings in this additional probe sector , perhaps this is an indication that we need to actually consider back - reaction by both parallel - shaped and the u - shaped profiles separately and then compare the free energies of these two backgrounds .",
    "this is a very interesting yet technically more involved problem subject to ongoing research . for present purposes",
    ", we will adhere to a simpler analysis and pretend that the additional probe sector and the back - reacting probe sector are distinguishable , which should be viewed as a first attempt towards exploring the actual issue .",
    "in the present article we will explore more aspects of the flavour sector by introducing additional probe branes in the back - reacted background and exciting a constant electro - magnetic field on this additional probe system .",
    "our focus is to study the flavour dependence on the phase structure obtained in @xcite .",
    "this effort , the reader should note , is merely a first attempt to understand how the qcd phase diagram might depend on the number of flavour degrees of freedom . using lattice simulations , current understanding of flavour dependence of the qcd phase diagram at vanishing chemical potential",
    "is usually summarized in the so called  columbia plot \" ( see for example fig 1 in @xcite ) . however , there is no general understanding about the phase structure in the presence of external fields such as the ones considered in this article .",
    "thus our hope is to learn about robust qualitative features which may be relevant to qcd ; although we have to remember that since we account for the back - reaction only up to the leading order in @xmath11 , the flavour dependence that we will find within this framework is , by definition , weak .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that this back - reaction breaks the conformal invariance of the background will result in some drastic changes as compared to the case when the back - reaction vanishes .",
    "this article is divided in the following sections : section 2 reviews the most relevant results on the back - reacted background obtained in @xcite . in section 3 , we discuss some interesting physical aspects of the perturbative back - reacted solution , while in section 4 , electro - magnetic fields are introduced in the probe sector and their effects are investigated thoroughly , including their impact on holographic renormalization of uv divergences of the on - shell dbi action .",
    "moreover , section 4 contains an exhibition of the most pertinent effects associated with the introduction of a chemical potential , studied both in the grand - canonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "finally , section 5 offers concluding remarks and an outlook on future research .",
    "let us begin with a brief review of the earlier results based on which we will continue to explore similar physical effects in our current work . before taking any back - reaction into account ,",
    "the model we consider is described in @xcite .",
    "the authors introduced probe d7/anti - d7 branes in the ads@xmath14 background , which is obtained as the near - horizon limit of a stack of d3-branes placed at the tip of the conifold .",
    "the d7/anti - d7 branes wrap a @xmath15-cycle in the internal manifold @xmath16 and are extended along the rest of the conifold .    before introducing the flavours ,",
    "the dual field theory is given by an @xmath17 superconformal quiver gauge theory in @xmath18-dimensions with a gauge group @xmath19 and a global @xmath20 symmetry group .",
    "the degrees of freedom are contained in two bi - fundamental chiral superfields which transform in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 representations of the gauge group .    introducing",
    "the probe branes corresponds , in the dual field theory , to introducing flavour degrees of freedom in an analogue of the so called  quenched approximation \" .",
    "this amounts to introducing a global @xmath23 flavour symmetry group , where @xmath24 denotes the number of flavours .",
    "the zero temperature physics of this system captures a geometric realization of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry : the brane  anti - brane pair joins in the ir breaking the aforementioned flavour symmetry group down to a diagonal @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite temperature physics of this system is rather trivial : since the background is conformal , there is no scale in the system and hence no phase transition can happen .",
    "chiral symmetry is always restored in this case @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the system exhibits interesting phase structure and some interesting phenomenon , such as the effect of _ magnetic catalysis _ in chiral symmetry breaking , when more control parameters are introduced @xcite . in this article",
    "we will analyze the effect of the back - reaction by flavours on the physics observed and analyzed in @xcite .    towards that end , we need to find the back - reacted background . such a background can be found by sourcing the supergravity equations of motion by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) contribution coming from the probe flavour degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out that , employing the  smearing technique \" , we can find an analytical solution of these back - reacted equations of motion at the leading order in the @xmath11 correction @xcite . in einstein frame ,",
    "the most general form of the back - reacted background is given by @xmath26 \\ , \\\\",

    "the general solution in @xcite contains another constant which is denoted by @xmath40 ; however , since the coupling corresponding to the dimension @xmath13 operator is a linear combination of these two constants , we have set @xmath41 without the loss of any generality .",
    "] note that the relevant physical coupling should be defined at the temperature scale .",
    "however , for our background this relation takes the form @xmath42   + \\co(\\epsilon^2 ) \\ , \\label{lambdath}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields @xmath43 .",
    "since the background in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) is valid up to @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature of the background can be identified with the inverse period of the euclidean time direction .",
    "this yields @xcite , @xmath46    before proceeding further , let us comment on the regime of validity of the solution given in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) . to avoid the landau pole coming from the diverging dilaton field we need to impose @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the uv cut - off .",
    "now the perturbative solution for various other functions will hold provided @xmath49      in @xcite , we have explored the phase diagram of an additional probe sector in the background given in ( [ backmet ] ) and ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) imposing @xmath50 , _ i.e. _ setting the source for the dimension @xmath13 operator to zero .",
    "the inclusion of the back - reaction breaks the conformal invariance of the background and we found that the additional probe sector now undergoes a chiral phase transition .",
    "this phase transition is , in a very precise sense , caused by the existence of the landau pole : this pole is located at @xmath51 at the leading order in @xmath52 , which means we need to use a momentum uv cut - off . in what follows , we will discuss the phase structure in the additional probe sector including more control parameters such as a constant electro - magnetic field .    before going further ,",
    "let us revisit the phase structure in more details .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce @xmath53 additional probe d7 and anti - d7 branes such that @xmath54 .",
    "these @xmath53 probes are aligned in a way similar to the back - reacting flavour branes .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath53 flavours are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the tension of the probe , @xmath57 denotes the volume along the three spatial directions and @xmath58 is the background temperature .",
    "we have denoted @xmath59 and also used the fact that it is consistent to set @xmath60 .",
    "the equation of motion admits two classes of solutions : the parallel - shaped solutions denoted by @xmath61 and the u - shaped solutions given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the point where the brane  anti - brane pair joins smoothly .",
    "the parallel - shaped solutions correspond to the chiral symmetry restored phase and the u - shaped solutions correspond to the chiral symmetry broken phase .    before discussing the phase transition , let us comment on the dependence of the coupling @xmath64 on the expansion parameter @xmath52 . for @xmath65 , the asymptotic angular separation is given by @xmath66 thus at the leading order in @xmath52 the angular separation decreases linearly with @xmath52 with a slope which is determined by @xmath63 and @xmath36 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath64 with @xmath52 is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ phir0 ] .",
    "it is clear that , for the u - shaped profiles , increasing the effect of the back - reaction reduces the maximum value attained by the angular separation , denoted by @xmath67 .     and @xmath68 respectively corresponding the u - shaped embeddings .",
    "we have set @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the solid vertical blue line correspond to the parallel embeddings . ]    in fact there is more physics in fig .",
    "[ phir0 ] : it displays the various available phases of the system for a given value of the coupling @xmath64 . for any @xmath72",
    ", we only have the chiral symmetry restored phase available . on the other hand , for any @xmath73 , we have three available points in the phase space : one on the vertical solid line and two on the dashed curves .",
    "comparing this situation with the more familiar @xmath74-diagram of the van der waals gas , we can conclude that there exists a first order phase transition from a point on the solid vertical line ( _ i.e. _ the chiral symmetry restored phase ) to a point on the dashed line ( _ i.e. _ the chiral symmetry broken phase ) for some critical value of @xmath64 .",
    "the energetics of the two classes of embeddings will now decide the phase of the system .",
    "one has to look at the euclidean on - shell action  which is identified with the thermodynamic free energy of the system  for these two types of embeddings and compute their difference @xmath75 now depending whether @xmath76 or @xmath77 , we will get a chiral symmetry restored or a chiral symmetry broken phase .",
    "this results in a non - trivial phase structure analyzed in @xcite , which we have shown in fig .",
    "[ figphase ] .",
    "the phase diagram is presented in the @xmath64 vs @xmath78 plane , where @xmath78 is defined as @xmath79     vs @xmath78 plane .",
    "the blue line separates the @xmath80sb @xmath81 chiral symmetry broken phase ( below the line ) from the @xmath80sr @xmath81 chiral symmetry restored phase ( above the line ) . between the blue and the red line , we also have a metastable @xmath80sb phase . above the red line we have only the @xmath80sr phase . ]",
    "we want to emphasize two main features here : first , in the absence of the back - reaction , no such phase structure exists at finite temperature .",
    "the underlying theory is conformal and only the chiral symmetry restored phase exists . taking back - reaction into account breaks the conformal invariance by introducing a uv landau pole and also deforming the cft by higher dimensional irrelevant operators . in the leading order back - reacted solution described here , the uv landau pole is located at @xmath51 and the couplings corresponding to the irrelevant operators of dimension @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively are denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath82 .    from the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ figphase ] it is clear that @xmath83 is not a special point as far as the existence of the phase transition is considered .",
    "thus we can conclude that the non - trivial phase structure and the associated thermodynamics that we obtain in this back - reacted model is caused by the existence of the landau pole .",
    "we will now move on to discuss the effect of the back - reaction on some bulk properties of the background as well as the phase structure of an additional probe sector in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "let us briefly comment on a few physical properties that we can extract from the solution in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) . to begin with , let us focus on the physics of the energy loss of the plasma . in the presence of the black hole , _ i.e. _ , introducing a non - zero temperature in the dual field theory , dissipation will occur due to the presence of the black hole in the bulk .",
    "we can now investigate how the back - reaction of the flavours affect the physics of dissipation at least when the back - reaction is taken into account perturbatively .",
    "within such a  stringy \" framework , there are two canonical ways to explore this : first , in a perturbative description , the mechanism of energy loss of a parton moving in a plasma is usually characterized by the so called jet quenching parameter @xcite , usually denoted by @xmath84 . in @xcite , it was proposed that a non - perturbative description of the jet quenching parameter is given by a light - like wilson loop , which one can use to perform computations at strong coupling .",
    "second , within the  stringy \" framework , the energy loss of a moving quark ( parton ) can be easily modeled by considering a fundamental string moving with a constant velocity .",
    "the force required to drag the string at a constant velocity is essentially the energy that is being lost in the plasma .",
    "this was first proposed and explored in @xcite . here",
    "we will explore both these cases .",
    "let us begin with the jet quenching parameter . using the general formula in @xcite ,",
    "the jet quenching parameter is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the spacetime metric in the einstein frame and the dilaton enters because of the conversion factor between the string frame and the einstein frame .",
    "this gives @xmath87 \\ , \\\\",

    "the sign of the parameter @xmath37 , which is hitherto unconstrained , determines whether the flavour contribution to the jet quenching parameter is positive or negative .",
    "the @xmath37-independent contribution is always positive .",
    "note that , in @xcite the parameter @xmath37 is set to zero and thus the flavour contribution turns out to be always positive .",
    "the inclusion of the back - reaction breaks the underlying conformal symmetry by introducing a dimension @xmath13 operator , which _ a priori _ can have both positive or negative contribution .",
    "the dimension @xmath12 operator , however , does not play any role here .",
    "we will keep our discussion brief and follow @xcite closely as far as notations are concerned . to discuss the drag force computation , we need to consider the following : let us start from the back - reacted background and consider a string that is hanging from the boundary , which in this case is located at @xmath31 .",
    "the end point of the string describes a quark moving in the plasma as the string propagates in the bulk space - time .",
    "the ansatz for such a moving string takes the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 represents the string worldsheet and @xmath96 denotes the velocity of the quark .    due to the constant velocity",
    ", the string worldsheet develops a horizon that can be obtained from the following formula : @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the location of the horizon and @xmath86 once again denotes the background spacetime .",
    "the momentum transfer is given by @xcite @xmath99 where the dilaton @xmath100 enters the above formula since @xmath86 is presented in the einstein frame .",
    "thus we finally get @xmath101 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4 } \\frac{\\pi^2 t^2 v}{\\sqrt{1-v^2 } } \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\rm th } } \\left [ 1 + \\frac{\\epsilon}{16 } - \\frac{\\epsilon}{8 } \\log\\left(1 - v^2 \\right)^{1/4 } + \\frac{\\epsilon\\alpha}{2 } l^4 \\pi^4 t^4 \\frac{1- 3 v^2}{1 - v^2}\\right ] \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the t hooft coupling defined at the temperature scale from ( [ lambdath ] ) . from the second line above",
    "we observe that for @xmath102 , the energy loss is enhanced by the presence of the back - reaction .",
    "note that @xmath103 corresponds to the speed of sound for the medium and therefore it is curious to observe that the energy loss changes signature across this speed .",
    "we can use the background found in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) to explore some of the non - perturbative aspects of the dual theory . the dual theory in this case",
    "is a non - supersymmetric theory which consists of the klebanov - witten theory coupled with a chiral flavour sector .",
    "we can investigate how the interaction between the flavours is affected by the presence of the adjoint as well as the fundamental degrees of freedom in this non - supersymmetric theory . to explore this",
    ", we can consider a massive quark anti - quark pair such that the mass of the pair is very small compared to the landau pole .",
    "the corresponding bound state is given by a string worldsheet ending on a probe flavour brane that extends from @xmath63 to @xmath48 , where @xmath63 is some infrared scale satisfying @xmath104 .",
    "to parametrize the worldsheet of the string we can choose : @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is one of the spatial directions ranging from @xmath108 to @xmath109 ; and @xmath95 represents the string worldsheet parameters .",

    "our task here is to study the potential @xmath111 as a function of the quark  anti - quark separation @xmath110 .",
    "recall that at zero temperature , in the absence of any back - reaction , the quark  anti - quark potential is coulombic @xcite ; at finite temperature it undergoes a phase transition depending on the value of @xmath113 , as observed in @xcite . in the presence of the back - reaction , this phase transition will continue to exist and will receive @xmath52 order corrections .",
    "thus we do not expect any qualitative change in the thermal physics of the system .",
    "therefore we will consider the case when @xmath114 and explore how the coulomb potential is affected by the back - reaction . a representative plot is shown in fig .  [ qqpot ] .    ) and ( [ potqq ] ) .",
    "the black dashed line corresponds to @xmath115 and the red dashed line correspond to @xmath116 .",
    "we have further set @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 . ]",
    "it is evident that the coulomb behaviour of the potential does not change in the presence of the back - reaction .",
    "although we have not explicitly presented it , this behaviour does not change when @xmath120 .",
    "this is in accord with what has been observed in _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "entanglement entropy is a measure of quantum entanglement of a given system .",
    "it is defined as the von neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix . for a given system ,",
    "let us imagine dividing it into two parts denoted by @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "for an observer who is restricted to access the information of the subsystem @xmath121 only , the system will be described by the reduced density matrix @xmath123 , where @xmath124 denotes the total density matrix of the full system .",
    "now , the entanglement entropy of the subsystem @xmath121 is defined as @xmath125 in the context of ads / cft correspondence , a proposal to compute the entanglement entropy was suggested in @xcite .",
    "suppose we divide the system into two regions : one  rectangular \" strip of length @xmath110 along @xmath107-direction ( denoted by @xmath121 ) and its complement .",
    "the  rectangular \" strip obviously has an infinite dimension along the @xmath126 and the @xmath127-directions . in such a scenario ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is obtained by computing the minimal area surface whose boundary coincides with the boundary of the region @xmath121 .    in the @xmath128-dimensional einstein frame metric , the ryu - takayanagi proposal yields @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the area of the  rectangular \" strip along the @xmath131-direction .",
    "the minimal area surface is parametrized by @xmath132 with the boundary conditions @xmath133 . before going further ,",
    "let us note that for the perturbative solution presented in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) the quantity @xmath134 is independent of the coupling @xmath82 .",
    "hence the dimension @xmath12 operator will have vanishing contribution to the entanglement entropy at least at the leading order in @xmath52 .",
    "this is not true for the dimension @xmath13 operator , whose coupling is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the equation of motion resulting from minimizing the volume functional is given by @xmath135 where we have imposed the condition that at @xmath136 the minimal area surface turns over and have defined : @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "substituting back the profile of the minimal area surface in ( [ ee ] ) , we get @xmath140 at the leading order in @xmath52 .",
    "one crucial property of the entanglement entropy is the so called  area law \" , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath141 scales as the area of the sub - region @xmath121 : @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is an infrared cut - off in the dual field theory .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath144 and there are no sub - leading divergent pieces , as was previously alluded to in @xcite ; the new term here is @xmath145 . using the explicit functions for the background in ( [ solb])-([solg ] ) , it is straightforward to check that @xmath146 where @xmath48 is the uv cut - off and we can identify @xmath147 .",
    "note that the term @xmath148 has to be small because of the condition in ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the divergence structure is the same as in the case where the back - reaction vanishes .",
    "it is nonetheless an interesting question whether going beyond a leading order perturbative solution in @xmath52 changes the divergence structure of the entanglement entropy .",
    "we will investigate the effects of introducing a constant electromagnetic field on the additional probe sector in this model .",
