    "in recent years , there has been a revival of interest for the semi - classical transport properties of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) particularly for the behavior of the classical magneto - resistance ( mr ) .",
    "on one hand , it is due to the technological progress in the preparation of high mobility heterostructures , 2degs with artificial scattering and modulating potential , antidot lattices , weak modulated one - dimensional structures , and so on . on the other hand , a remarkable progress has been made recently in the theoretical understanding of the importance of memory effects in semi - classical magneto - transport . in the simplest situation of a degenerated non - interacting 2deg with isotropic fermi surface",
    "the conventional boltzmann - drude approach yields zero magneto - resistance , i.e. the value of the longitudinal component of the resistivity tensor @xmath1 does not depend on magnetic field . however , already in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "the importance of non - boltzmann classical memory effects on the magneto - transport of 2degs with a small a number of impurities was demonstrated and a large negative mr was predicted .",
    "more than ten years later this mr was observed in experiments performed in antidot lattices@xmath2 .",
    "however it s only recently that the purely classical origin of this mr was fully recognized",
    ". this mr may be either negative or positive depending on the type of the scattering potential , and it appears as a consequence of memory effects@xmath3 both in high ( @xmath4)@xmath5 and weak magnetic fields ( @xmath6)@xmath7 . recently a very important step in the understanding of the role of memory effects on the magneto - transport of a real 2deg in strong magnetic field was done in ref .  .",
    "in this paper the theory of the magneto - resistance of a 2deg scattered by a short -range disorder potential in the presence of a long - range correlated random potential has been advanced .",
    "the most important result of this theory is that the interplay of two types of scattering potential generates a new behavior of @xmath8 absent when only one kind of disorder is present , and leads to a positive non - saturating mr .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare the experimental behavior of the quasi - classical mr in high mobility 2degs in algaas / gaas heterostructure with and without artificial scatters to the theory@xmath9 .",
    "we have observed a large positive non - saturating mr of the 2deg and the addition of artificial scatters ( antidots ) in this 2deg results in a negative mr in intermediate fields that leads a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath8 predicted in ref .  .",
    "the samples we studied were : 1 ) high mobility 2degs in mbe grown algaas / gaas heterostructures with a spacer thickness of 40 nm ( sample 188 and 189 ) and 60 nm ( sample 218 ) ; 2 ) lattices of antidot fabricated on the basis of this 2deg . the parameters of the 2deg at @xmath10= 4.2 k were the following : sample 188 - @xmath11 at electron densities @xmath12 ; sample 189 - mobility @xmath13 at @xmath14 and sample 218 - @xmath15 at electron densities @xmath16.the samples were photolithographically processed into 50 @xmath17 m hall bars with the distance between the four voltage probes on each side 100 , 250 and 100 @xmath17 m and ohmic contacts to the hall bars were prepared by annealing of aunige .",
    "an antidot lattice with the period @xmath18=0.6 @xmath17 m was fabricated on the basis of sample 218 with hall bars on it by means of electron lithography and consequent plasma etching .",
    "the samples were measured at @xmath19 in magnetic fields up to 15 t using superconducting magnet and a variable temperature insert .",
    "the data was acquired using standard low frequency lock - in technique .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a shows @xmath8 for the sample 218 at different temperatures in magnetic fields up to 4 t at the electron density @xmath20 ( the mobility is @xmath21 at 4.2 k so that @xmath22 at 5 t and the mobility is @xmath23 at 40 k with @xmath24 at 5 t ) . the hall resistance @xmath25 under the same conditions",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b .    at the lowest temperature ( @xmath26 k ) the conventional behavior for high mobility 2degs",
    "is observed : for @xmath27 t there is a small parabolic - like negative mr ( possibly due the interaction effects@xmath28 not discussed here ) , then the subnikov de haas ( sdh ) oscillations appear , and finally the quantum hall effect sets in with deep minima in @xmath8 and corresponding plateaus in @xmath25 . for high temperatures we observe the disappearance of the sdh oscillations and the magneto - resistance turning to @xmath29 with @xmath30 close to 1 .",
    "+ the same behavior ( except for the low field range where there is no parabolic nmr ) is observed in samples 188 and 189 with larger electron densities and mobilities ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath13 at @xmath34 k respectively for 188 and 189 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2]a and  [ fig : fig2]b ) .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is close to the value found for sample 218 .",
    "+ a large non - saturating mr was actually observed in earlier papers devoted to high mobility ( @xmath35 ) 2degs@xmath36 .",
    "however all measurements were performed at temperatures @xmath37 k and the semi - classical mr was not clearly detected because of the oscillating dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "our aim here is to study the mr dependence in strong magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) in the high temperatures quasi - classical regime ( i.e. @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the number of occupied landau level ) .",
    "according to the usual conception of the magneto - transport in high magnetic field the increase of temperature should lead to : 1 ) a decrease in the amplitude of sdh oscillations and their complete suppression for @xmath41 and 2 ) a weak magnetic field dependence of the resistance as long as @xmath42 . in this regime @xmath43 so we should not observe a value of @xmath44 exceeding 10% even at 5 t. + fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] show that our experiment completely supports the first point : heating the samples to temperatures higher than 20 k leads to the complete disappearance of sdh oscillations .",
    "however our high - t experiments reveals @xmath44 as high as 10 - 15 for all our samples , a clear contradiction with the second assumption .",
    "+ note that the value of the fermi energy is @xmath45 for sample 218 , @xmath46 for sample 188 and @xmath47 for sample 189 which are significantly larger than @xmath48 even at the highest temperature 40 k ( @xmath49 at 40 k ) . so that the mr can be not attributed to a non - degeneracy of the 2deg at this temperature .",
    "more over , as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] the curves are very symmetric and the possibility of mixing between hall and longitudinal signal can be excluded .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] summarizes the results for all samples : @xmath50 are plotted ( the curves are displayed in order to keep the condition @xmath51 satisfied ) .    at first glance this result is not surprising ; indeed a theory of magneto - transport in a long range scattering potential ( which is the case for high mobility 2degs in algaas / gaas heterostructures ) has recently been proposed@xmath52 .",
    "it predicts a positive mr .",
    "however according to this theory @xmath53 and , more importantly , @xmath44 should show a maximum around @xmath54 and go to zero in the limit of infinite fields ( this is the sign of the localization of electrons in this limit ) .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows that we observe no saturation even at @xmath55 as high as @xmath56 .",
    "so we are in the interesting following situation : theoretically it is predicted that if only one kind of scattering potential is present ( short range or long range ) there should be either no mr at all or a negative mr in the limit of infinite magnetic field . on the contrary",
    "we observe a large ( @xmath57 ) non - saturating magneto - resistance .",
    "note that quantum calculation in the framework of born approximation@xmath58 can give a positive mr at high temperatures ( when sdh oscillations are washed out ) but the value of the exponent @xmath30 is then 0.5 not around 1 as we observe so the theoretical framework completely fails to explain our data . + a qualitative explanation of our results might be given in the recent work of ref .   where the theory of a semi - classical magneto - transport in 2degs with both kinds of disorder potential ( which is always the case in any sample ) has been advanced .",
    "the more important conclusion of this theory is that the interplay of short range disorder ( random ensemble of impenetrable discs of diameter @xmath59 and density @xmath60 ) and long - range correlated disorder generates a new behavior of @xmath8 including the appearance of a non - saturating positive semi - classical mr .",
    "the autor shows that the localization ( @xmath61 when @xmath62 ) induced by the presence of only one kind of disorder is destroyed by the presence the other kind of disorder . in this theory the short range scattering",
    "is characterized by the mean free path @xmath63 and the long range scattering by @xmath64 . in the hydrodynamic limit ( @xmath65 )",
    "the theory gives four ranges of magnetic field dependence for the positive mr .",
    "in the first range @xmath66 , as @xmath67 is increased @xmath1 turns to @xmath68 , then to @xmath69 and finally to @xmath70 .",
    "qualitatively the experiment shows a similar behavior ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . but a more detailed comparison shows that there are some differences : for the sample 218 we observe a first range with @xmath66 and then a transition to the dependence @xmath71 with @xmath72 increasing with the magnetic field ( this value is slightly larger than 10/13 ) . for the sample 188 and 189",
    "the picture is different : at weak magnetic fields there is no @xmath66 range , instead we observe @xmath73 and at magnetic fields where @xmath74 the behavior is the same as for sample 218 .",
    "there is nothing surprising in the observed difference between the experiment and the theory because the hydrodynamic limit is a very idealized picture and the scattering potential in a real high mobility 2deg is much more complicated .",
    "also , note that at temperatures @xmath75 k a significant contribution ( see the insert to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) of the phonon scattering appears that can modify the magnetic field dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "obviously phonon scattering should not radically change the situation principally because phonon scattering plays the same role as short range scattering .",
    "nevertheless an accurate description of the experiment at high temperatures requires a theory including phonon scattering .",
    "+   + a very interesting prediction of the theory is given for antidot arrays . in this case",
    "the theory predicts a negative mr in intermediate magnetic fields leading to a non - monotonic dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : fig4]a shows the experimental dependence @xmath8 measured in an antidot lattice , fabricated on the basis of sample 218 at temperatures between 1.4 k and 40 k for @xmath76 . the hall resistance measured under the same conditions",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b .",
    "the insert to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]a reveals that at high enough temperatures ( when sdh oscillations are suppressed ) the experimental curve @xmath8 demonstrate a non - monotonic behavior . for @xmath77 t a negative mr due to the formation of rosette trajectories is observed .",
    "this nmr is then replaced by a non - saturating positive mr , which is similar to the positive mr observed in the unpatterned 2degs . a the same time the hall resistance shows no extra - features evolving from a curve with plateaus into strait line when",
    "the temperature is increased ( same behavior as in unpatterned samples ) .",
    "qualitatively the behavior is well described by theory@xmath9 .",
    "however the detailed dependence of @xmath8 obtained from analytical calculations ( see part iii c from ref .  ) does not coincide with the experimental data ; neither for the negative mr nor for the positive mr and the theory fails to describe the details of our data .",
    "we do not observe the @xmath78 for nmr and the value @xmath79 for pmr of the experimental curve near @xmath8 minimum .",
    "the experiment shows @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "one of the possible reasons of this disagreement is that the theory considers a random array of antidots while our experiment is performed in a periodic lattice .",
    "+ anyway even if it fails to describe accurately our data the theory predicts a minimum and it is interesting to compare the position of the experimental minimum to this prediction .",
    "indeed its position depends on the correlation length of the long range potential and of the average density of antidots independently of the arrangement of the antidots .",
    "the theory gives the following condition at the minimum :    @xmath82^{7/19}$ ] +    where @xmath83 , @xmath63 is the mean free path in the short range potential , @xmath64 is the mean free path in the long range potential , @xmath60 is the density of antidots , @xmath84 is the correlation length of the long range potential and @xmath85 is the cyclotron radius at the minimum . for our lattice parameters we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "this value is close to the spacer thickness ( @xmath87 ) which is known to determine the correlation length of the long range potential .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the quasi - classical mr of a high mobility 2deg in algaas / gaas heterostructure is very large and non - saturating up to values of @xmath55 exceeding 300 .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of @xmath8 follows the law @xmath88 ( @xmath30=0.9 - 1.1 ) . in antidot lattices",
    "we observe a non - monotonic behavior of the mr ( negative first and then positive and non - saturating similar to that observed in unpatterned samples ) .",
    "the comparison of the experimental results with the theory@xmath9 gives satisfactory qualitative agreement but the theory fails to describe the details of the magneto - resistance traces .",
