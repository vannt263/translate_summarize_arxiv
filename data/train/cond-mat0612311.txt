    "measurement of the terrace width distribution ( twd ) @xmath0 of vicinal surfaces is now used routinely to find the dimensionless strength @xmath1 of the elastic repulsion between steps .",
    "the university of maryland @xcite and the forschungszentrum - jlich @xcite have been at the vanguard of this progress .",
    "use of an extension of the wigner surmise from random matrix theory has resolved ambiguities on how best to estimate @xmath1 from the variance .",
    "this paper discusses the history of this development and the crucial role played by harald ibach in divining from physical insight an analytic expression for the twd associated with the special case @xmath2 that is essentially the same as the simple expression that wigner surmised describes ( albeit , ultimately , not exactly ) the distribution of the energy differences of adjacent levels in a nucleus when the coupling has unitary symmetry .",
    "this insight spawned my long collaborative effort with fz - jlich to develop generalizations appropriate to arbitrary vicinal surfaces and to corroborate the viability of the resulting formulation to account for extensive experimental data .",
    "in addition to a personal history of this progress ( with a few new results ) , i collect ( with enhancements ) in one place several tables from publications and present a concise  user s guide \" for applying the formalism and a short discussion of some recent developments , e.g. , for azimuthally misoriented vicinal surfaces and for non - equilibrium situations .",
    "space limitations preclude fuller discussions or an authoritative update on experimental progress .",
    "three of the four figures are heretofore unpublished . also interwoven are comments stimulated by several penetrating questions , many by harald ibach , that arose during talks i gave in germany that forced me to sharpen my thinking .",
    "these are topics typically skirted in publications as being well - established , but my experience is that they are not generally well understood .",

    " maryland notation \" the normal to the vicinal surface lies in the @xmath4 plane , and the distance @xmath5 between steps is measured along @xmath6 , while the steps run along the @xmath7 direction . in the simplest and usual approximation , the repulsions between adjacent steps arise from two sources : an entropic or steric interaction due to the physical condition that the steps can not cross , since overhangs can not occur in nature .",
    "the second comes from elastic dipole moments due to local atomic relaxation around each step , leading to frustrated lateral relaxation of atoms on the terrace plane between two steps .",

    "( contrary to widespread misconception , @xmath9 need not be a multiple of , or even simply related to , the substrate lattice spacing .",
    "it is the step height times @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the _ arbitrary _ misorientation , as in shown in fig .",

    "therefore , we consider @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , a dimensionless length . for a  perfect \" cleaved crystal ,",
    "@xmath14 is just a spike @xmath15 .",
    "if , as intrinsic to 1d models , the steps are imagined as uncooked spaghetti dropped at any position with probability @xmath16 , @xmath14 is a poisson distribution @xmath17 .",
    "actual steps do meander , as one study most simply in a terrace - step - kink ( tsk ) model . in this model ,",
    "the only excitations are kinks ( with energy @xmath18 ) along the step .",
    "( this is a good approximation at low temperature @xmath19 since adatoms or vacancies on the terrace cost several @xmath18 [ 4@xmath18 in the case of a simple cubic lattice ] .",
    "the entropic repulsion due to step meandering dramatically decreases the probability of finding adjacent steps at @xmath20 . to preserve the mean of one ,",
    "@xmath14 must also be smaller than @xmath17 for large @xmath21 .    if there is an additional energetic repulsion @xmath22 , the magnitude of the step meandering will decrease , narrowing @xmath14 . as @xmath23 , the width approaches a delta function .",
    "note that the energetic and entropic interactions do not simply add .",
    "in particular , there is no negative ( attractive ) value of @xmath24 at which the two cancel each other .",
    "thus , for strong repulsions , steps rarely come close , so the entropic interaction plays a smaller role , while for @xmath25 , the entropic contribution increases , as illustrated in fig .",

    "investigation of the interaction between steps on vicinal surfaces is a core part of the flourishing field of exploring the properties of these technologically important and scientifically rich systems , as discussed in several excellent reviews @xcite .",
    "the earliest studies seeking to extract @xmath24 from twds used the mean - field - like gruber - mullins @xcite approximation , in which a single active step fluctuates between two fixed straight steps @xmath26 apart .",
    "then the energy associating with the fluctuations @xmath27 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the step free energy per length ( or line tension @xcite ) for a step at orientation @xmath30 relative to the mean direction of the step ( and the direction of the fixed , bounding steps ) , and @xmath31 is the size of the system along the mean step direction ( i.e. the step length with no kinks ) .",
    "we expand @xmath32 as the taylor series @xmath33 and recognize that the length of the line segment has increased from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . for close - packed steps , for which @xmath36 , it is well known that ( using @xmath37 ) ,    [ f : enteng ]    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the step stiffness @xcite .",
    "most treatments gloss over the fact that the stiffness has the same definition for steps with arbitrary in - plane orientation .",
    "the key point is that to create such steps , one must apply a  torque \" @xcite which exactly cancels the linear term @xmath40 .",
    "stasevich @xcite provides a more formal proof .",
    "since @xmath41 is taken to be a single - valued function that is defined over the whole domain of @xmath42 , the 2d configuration of the step can be viewed as the worldline of a particle in 1d by recognizing @xmath42 as a time - like variable .",
    "since the steps can not cross , these particles can be described as 1d fermions .",
    "we also see from eq .",
    "( [ e : stiff ] ) that in the ( 1 + 1)d formulation , @xmath43 , with the form of a velocity , so that the stiffness plays the role of a _ mass _ ; indeed , it serves as the inertial parameter of steps in this fermion perspective ( though not with regard to actual dynamics in response to external forces @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , stiffness is one of the three ingredients of the very - successful step - continuum model @xcite .",
    "pursuing this analogy for polymers in 2d , de gennes @xcite showed nearly 4 decades ago that this problem could be mapped into the schrdinger equation in 1d , with the thermal energy @xmath44 replacing @xmath45 .",
    "then in the gruber - mullins approximation @xcite , the step with no energetic interactions becomes a particle in a 1d infinite well of width @xmath26 , with well - known groundstate properties    @xmath46    thus , it is the kinetic energy of the ground state in the quantum model that corresponds to the entropic repulsion ( per length ) of the step . in the exact solution for the free energy expansion of the equilibrium crystal shape @xcite , the numerical coefficient in the corresponding term is @xmath47 rather than @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath14 peaks at @xmath49 and vanishes for @xmath50 .",
    "suppose , next , that there is an energetic repulsion @xmath51 between steps . in the 1d schrdinger equation ,",

    "however , it has some notable shortcomings .",
    "perhaps most obviously , it is useless for small but not vanishing @xmath61 , for which the twd is highly skewed , not resembling a gaussian , and the peak , correspondingly , is significantly below the mean spacing . for large values of @xmath61",
    ", it significantly underestimates the variance or , equivalently , the value of @xmath61 one extracts from the experimental twd width : ihle et al .",
    "@xcite point out that in the gruber - mullins approximation the twd variance is the same as that of the active step , since the neighboring step is straight . for large @xmath61",
    "the fluctuations of the individual steps on an actual vicinal surface become relatively independent , so the variance of the twd is the _ sum _ of the variance of each , i.e. twice the step variance . given the great ( quartic ) sensitivity of @xmath61 to the twd width , this is problematic .",
    "as experimentalists acquired more high - quality twd data , other approximation schemes were proposed , all producing gaussian distributions with widths @xmath62 , but with proportionality constants notably larger than @xmath63 .    for the  free - fermion \" ( @xmath64 ) case , jos et al .",
    "@xcite developed at the beginning of the 1990 s a sequence of analytic approximants to the exact but formidable expression @xcite for @xmath14 .",
    "the procedure is based on a discrete version of the problem , representing the fermion - like steps in terms of second - quantized operators and taking note that the twd is not just a pair - wise step - step correlation function but actually a many - particle correlation function in which we demand that no step lie between the steps at 0 and @xmath5 .",

    "gaussian fits of the gwd : * since twds for strong repulsions are well described by gaussians , the gwd is well approximated by a gaussian in this limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite a quantitative assessment is given of how closely the two distributions correspond as a function of @xmath77 . at the calibration point ( for which an exact solution exists ) for repulsive interactions ( @xmath84 ) , the relative difference of the standard deviation of a gaussian fitted to @xmath85 from the actual standard deviation of this gwd ( viz",

    "formulas have been derived @xcite indicating the errors in fitting @xmath77 due to errors in the first or zeroth moment of the distribution .",
    "another criterion for the validity of the gaussian fitting function is that the twd not be noticeably asymmetric about its peak , i.e.  that it be negligible for @xmath91 .    *",
    "analyzing twd skewness : unfulfilled hopes : * when @xmath77 is too small for the twd to meet the criteria for adequate fitting by a gaussian , we hoped that one could obtain reliable estimates of @xmath61 by analyzing the skewness .",
    "although we tried a variety of formulas and schemes @xcite , it turned out that in the end a fit to the gwd was needed , so that skewness did not offer a shortcut to @xmath77 .    * correcting estimates based on gruber - mullins : * when dealing with tabulations of data analyzed in the traditional way @xcite based on the gruber - mullins perspective , it is useful to recast eq .",

    "this approach has not yet been tested with actual data .",
    "* wigner distribution as a 2-parameter fit : * the gwds giving the best fits of experimental twds sometimes have first moments that differ somewhat from the first moments of the data , especially in cases termed  poor data \" @xcite which exhibit a small  hump \" at large values of @xmath21 , beyond the mode .",
    "moreover , it may be desirable to determine the scaling length ( the  effective mean , \" which equals the first moment for ideal gwds ) and the variance in a single fitting procedure rather than to predetermine this length from the first moment . this",

    "random matrix theory is rooted in the study of energy eigenvalues in nuclear physics . as recounted beautifully in ref .",
    "@xcite , conventional statistical mechanics treats ensembles of identical physical systems with the same hamiltonian but different initial conditions .",
    "in contrast , wigner considered ensembles of dynamical systems governed by different hamiltonians @xmath130 having some common symmetry property and sought generic properties of such ensembles associated with the symmetry .",
    "dyson extended this work to show that there are three symmetries of the matrices of the hamiltonian : orthogonal ( real symmetric ) matrices correspond to time - reversal invariance with rotational symmetry , unitary ( complex ) matrices to violated time - reversal invariance ( as for electrons in a magnetic field ) , symplectic ( see eq .  ( 2.3 ) of @xcite ,  2.4 of @xcite ) to time - reversal invariance with broken rotational symmetry and 1/2-integer spin .",
    "wigner then , for convenience , considered gaussian weightings , @xmath131 , \\label{e : wd}\\ ] ] with the idea that for large matrices the _ fluctuations _ of the eigenvalues should be independent of the weight factors as well as of the specific form of the level spectrum .",
    "( there is no information about the _",

    "@xcite , we start with the simplest case , an orthogonal ensemble ( @xmath29=1 ) with @xmath132=2 ( just 2 particles ) , with @xmath130 having diagonal elements @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and off - diagonal element @xmath135 .",
    "we focus on the jacobean associated with a change of variables for the gaussian - ensemble probability distribution function in going from the joint probability distribution function @xmath136 for adjacent eigenenergies @xmath137 to @xmath138 ; we define variables @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "thus , @xmath142",
    ". we must now take into account all possible matrix elements @xmath143 . from eq .",

    "( [ e : whs ] ) as @xmath146 . since @xmath147 , @xmath148 . since @xmath149 do not depend on @xmath150",
    ", we can pull the exponential out of the integration over @xmath150 , leaving the elementary integral      next , since @xmath152 , the integration over @xmath153 is also elementary , and we are left with @xmath154 .",
    "this exact result for @xmath155 provides an excellent approximation for large @xmath132 as well . indeed , near the level crossing ( corresponding to @xmath156 ) the problem tends to reduce to a @xmath157 problem",
    "the integral for @xmath14 over variables @xmath150 and @xmath158 includes in its integrand a dirac delta function @xmath159^{1/2}\\right)$ ] , which vanishes for @xmath21=0 only when the two [ squared ] independent variables do .",
    "hence , @xmath160 , corresponding to a circular shell in parameter space , and we again have @xmath29=1 .    for unitary ensembles there is an additional independent parameter since @xmath161 becomes @xmath162 .",
    "hence , @xmath163 , corresponding to a spherical shell in parameter space , i.e.  @xmath29=2 .",
    "the argument for the symplectic ensemble leads similarly  but via quaternions or pauli spin matrices  to @xmath29=4 .",
    "line tension and step free energy per length are equivalent here since the surface is maintained at constant ( zero ) charge , but not in an electrochemical system , where the electrode potential @xmath11 is fixed rather than the surface charge density conjugate to @xmath11 .",

    "since @xmath21 is still determined from the raw data as @xmath170 , the refined scaling translates into replacing @xmath21 by @xmath171 in the argument of the distribution .",
    "if the integration variable @xmath21 were similarly replaced , then the refined scaling would amount to a redefinition of a dummy variable , normalization would still be realized ; however , the independent variable is kept as @xmath21 @xcite ."
