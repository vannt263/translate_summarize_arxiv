    "the art of determining states of quantum systems  quantum tomography  relies on performing measurements over multiple copies of the state in various bases , followed by reconstruction of the state s density matrix using suitable algorithms on the procured data .",

    "measurements on the black box response to a certain set of probe states allow one to predict the effect of that black box on any arbitrary state within a given hilbert space .",
    "qpt emerged in response to ever - increasing demands in the field of quantum information processing , as the assembly of any quantum information processor requires precise knowledge of each of its components @xcite .",
    "a popular approach to qpt involves determining the output @xmath0 for each state of a spanning set @xmath1 of the space of density matrices over the hilbert space of interest . due to the linearity of quantum processes over its density operators , the output of any arbitrary state @xmath2 can then be found as @xmath3 .",

    "this method , known as coherent - state qpt , or csqpt , has the advantage of employing only the easy - to - prepare coherent states for probing .",
    "however , the numerical reconstruction procedures employed in @xcite involve an intermediate step of determining the density matrices of the output states @xmath4 for each probe",
    "coherent state @xmath5 and subsequent integration with the p function .",
    "this approach requires a multistep calculation and does not guarantee to yield a process that is physically plausible , i.e. completely positive and trace non - increasing .",

    "the process reconstruction algorithm , on the other hand , is entirely different : it relies on the iterative maximum - likelihood approach .",

    "the technique presented in this paper extends the purview of maximum - likelihood qpt to the continuous variable state space , thereby allowing physically consistent quantum process estimation through homodyne tomography experiments @xcite .",
    "a further advantage of the present technique is the need of a significantly narrower range of coherent states to probe the process as compared to  @xcite .",
    "we test our approach on a number of processes that are relevant to quantum optical information processing : identity , attenuation and photon creation . in doing so",

    "however , a more rigorous yet technically simpler approach involves the formulation of an extremal equation that maximizes the log - likelihood functional given in equation ( [ eq : loglikelihood ] ) .    in order to carry out the reconstruction procedure",
    ", one needs to first select a certain basis for the representation of the process and the relevant operators . in the fock ( number state ) basis ,",

    "the actual process tensor @xmath36 is obtained by taking the projection of the estimated tensor @xmath83 onto the subspace @xmath37 .",
    "our analysis so far did not specify which states were to be used as probes ; the only requirement is that these states compose a spanning set in the space of density matrices . in csqpt ,",
    "the role of probe states is played by coherent states @xcite .",
    "the density operator of an arbitrary state can be written as a linear combination of coherent state density operators using the optical equivalence theorem : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the glauber - sudarshan p function of state @xmath86 . using the linearity of quantum processes with respect to density matrices , the process output",
    "is then given by @xmath87 therefore , if the response of the quantum system to all coherent states is known , the output of any arbitrary unknown quantum state can be computed . in other words ,",
    "measurements on the set of responses @xmath88 for coherent states @xmath89 provides tomographically complete information about the quantum process .",
    "we now proceed to discussing a few practical issues arising in the implementation of the above algorithm of csqpt .",
    "the first issue is associated with infinite dimension of the optical hilbert space . in practical implementation of csqpt ,",
    "the process tensor is reconstructed for a subspace @xmath90 of the hilbert space spanned by fock states up to a certain cut - off value , @xmath91 .",
    "the choice of @xmath91 is correlated with the maximum amplitude @xmath92 of the set of coherent probe states . given a data set with a specific @xmath92 ,",
    "the choice of @xmath91 depends on many factors , in particular , the process itself ( see supplementary online material to @xcite ) .",
    "for the iterative cycle , the cut - off value must be chosen sufficiently high so that @xmath90 accommodates all of the coherent probe states and the associated output states .",
    "otherwise , the probe states and the quadrature data will be inadequately represented by @xmath90 .",
    "this will lead to inaccurate reconstruction of the process tensor ; we refer to this phenomenon as _",
    "truncation errors_.    for physically realistic processes , we expect the fractions of @xmath89 and @xmath88 that lie outside the reconstruction subspace to vanish as @xmath93 tends to infinity .",
    "hence , for a given @xmath94 , it is possible to choose a value of @xmath93 such that the associated truncation errors are arbitrarily low @xcite .",
    "however , a high cut - off value may give rise to another class of inaccuracies , which we call _ data insufficiency errors_. if the overlap of a given fock state @xmath95 with all of the @xmath89 is low , so is the contribution of @xmath95 to the log - likelihood functional , and hence the available data will not provide sufficient information about the effect of the process on @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast to the truncation errors , the data insufficiency errors grow with @xmath91 , but only apply to the process tensor elements associated with high input photon numbers .",
    "therefore the following dual - step procedure for the choice of the cut - off may be necessary",
    ". the initial value of @xmath91 must be sufficiently high to ensure absence of truncation errors .",
    "subsequently , after the iterative cycle has been completed , we choose a secondary cut - off value , @xmath96 , and remove all the process tensor elements containing indices above @xmath97 .",
    "the choice of @xmath97 can be determined by calculating the statistical errors associated with each process tensor element - similar to the error estimations for state tomography @xcite .",
    "however , further research is required to determine statistical errors for qpt and establish a concrete bound for @xmath98 . in the next section ,",
    "we illustrate the effect of the chosen subspace dimension on the process reconstruction through various simulations .    as in the case of state tomography @xcite ,",
    "our algorithm permits automatic correction for optical losses and inefficient detectors in the process tensor reconstruction . in order to account for non - unitary efficiency @xmath99 ,",
    "the projection operators are replaced by @xmath100 where @xmath101^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "substituting this into equation   and performing the iterations generates the original process tensor pertaining to the case of ideal detection .",
    "many physically relevant processes are phase - invariant : applying an optical phase shift to the input state results in the same shift to the output .",
    "mathematically , such processes satisfy the following relation @xcite @xmath102 = \\hat{u}(\\phi)\\mathcal{e}(\\hat{\\rho})\\hat{u}^\\dagger(\\phi ) \\label{eq : phase_invariance}\\ ] ] in this case , further simplifications can be made .",
    "if the action of the process on a coherent state @xmath103 is known , so is the outcome for @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , one needs to only perform measurements for input coherent states with amplitudes on the positive real axis . when condition ( [ eq : phase_invariance ] ) is applied in the fock basis ,",
    "the elements of the process tensor @xmath105 for a phase - invariant process vanish except when @xmath106 .",
    "this condition is incorporated into the probability distribution ( [ eq : pdf ] ) as @xmath107,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 denotes a masking operation over @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath109 denotes a projection operator in the number basis , then @xmath110 can be expressed as @xmath111 since the trace operation is invariant under cyclic rearrangements of the operators and the kronecker delta is invariant under transposition of indices , the probability distribution ( [ eq : newpdf ] ) , and consequently , the expression for the operator @xmath80 in equation changes to @xmath112 \\\\",

    "stabilization can be achieved using the diluted algorithm that slows down but guarantees convergence @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath80 , in that case , is modified to a weighted sum of itself and the identity operator as @xmath115 where @xmath116 . as the value of @xmath117 decreases , the algorithm becomes more and more dilute , resulting in increased stability but a reduced rate of convergence .",
    "in addition , monotonic increase of the likelihood is guaranteed for small values of @xmath117 ( see [ sec : proof_convergence ] ) .",
    "one may try to find the optimal value of @xmath117 that maximizes the increase in likelihood at the cost of increased computational complexity .",
    "gradually varying the value of @xmath117 during the iterations may be justified for some processes .",
    "the number of quadrature measurements for each probe state typically ranges in tens of thousands . with multiple probe states",
    ", the iteration cycle may require significant computation time . in order to speed up",
    "the computation , binning of the data points in the quadrature and phase axes may be useful .",
    "a suitable step size is chosen for each axis as a trade - off between the desired computational time and the quantization error . for each @xmath88 ,",
    "quadrature data points are then clubbed into bins with centers @xmath118 . with this modification ,",
    "the log - likelihood functional   now reads as @xmath119,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 denotes the number of data points in the bin with center @xmath121 .",
    "ideally , one must obtain the povm associated with the bin center as a function of all the povms lying in the bin .",
    "however , given a small size of the bin , this element can be approximated by projection onto the quadrature value at the center of the bin .",
    "similarly , the operator @xmath80 in equation   can be rewritten as @xmath122 for further speedup , one can compute @xmath80 in a parallel fashion on different threads owing to absence of interdependency in the summation procedure .    in practical experiments on probabilistic processes ,",
    "the frequency of successful events can be low : @xmath123 . in this case , the process tensor elements of interest ( i.e. those related to @xmath35 ) will be small and thus suffer from increased relative error .",
    "this issue can be resolved by rescaling the values of all @xmath79 by the same factor for all probe states , keeping in mind the requirement that @xmath124 for all @xmath18 .",
    "physically relevant elements of the process tensor will then rescale by the same factor , reducing the relative error .",
    "+    in order to test the algorithm , we have implemented it using matlab and studied the reconstruction of a few quantum processes using simulated data .",
    "theoretical process tensors of identity , attenuation and photon creation @xcite were used to find the marginal probability distribution functions for various probe states using equation  . from the marginals",
    ", we generated synthetic experimental data through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "each process was applied to four coherent probe states with @xmath125 ranging from 0 to 0.9375 in steps of 0.3125 . for each input probe state ,",
    "the output state dataset consisted of 100,000 phase and quadrature points @xmath126 .",
    "this set of data was subjected to the reconstruction method described .",
    "the iterations were halted when the change in process tensor elements was insignificant over a large number of iterations .",
    "however , a better approach would be to set a threshold for the increase of the log - likelihood @xcite .",
    "the result obtained by running the reconstruction technique is a 4-dimensional process tensor whose diagonal elements have a simple interpretation . for a given quantum process @xmath6",
    ", the diagonal element @xmath127 denotes the probability that the output contains @xmath128 photons when the process is subjected to @xmath18 input photons .",
    "a comparison between the diagonal elements of the theoretical and reconstructed process tensor is made in and exhibits close match between the two .",
    "the process of photon creation @xmath129 requires additional discussion because it corresponds to a non - unitary , trace non - preserving operator .",
    "therefore , in experimental practice it can only be implemented probabilistically .",
    "the optical mode containing the target state @xmath130 is directed into the signal channel of a parametric down - conversion setup .",
    "the state of the down - conversion output in the signal ( @xmath131 ) and idler ( @xmath132 ) channels can then be written as @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the down - conversion amplitude .",
    "detection of a photon in the idler channel projects the signal state onto @xmath135 , thereby heralding a photon addition event @xcite . for coherent state input @xmath136 , the event probability , corresponding to the quantity @xmath137 in equation  , is proportional to @xmath138 .",
    "we take the value @xmath139 during simulations to ensure that success probabilities remain less than 1 for the probe states selected .",
    "this makes the photon creation process trace non - increasing and thus physical .",
    "note that the process tensor reported in ( f ) has been normalized by dividing by @xmath140 , so that its scale matches that of the process tensor for the photon creation operator @xmath141 given in ( c ) .",
    "the iterative reconstruction of photon creation exhibited relatively poor convergence .",
    "diluted iterations ( [ eq : diluted ] ) were required in the beginning in order to curb oscillations . however , as the iterations progressed , the rate of increase of the likelihood value became extremely low .",
    "we circumvented this issue by implementing the successive over - relaxation technique . setting @xmath117 in equation to slightly over @xmath142 while iterating accelerated the increase in likelihood .",
    "as soon as a decrease in the likelihood value was registered due to an overshoot , @xmath117 was reset to @xmath142 , and then slowly increased again after stabilization .",
    "this procedure was applied multiple times until a fair amount of convergence was observed . in a loose sense ,",
    "the over - relaxation method employs linear extrapolation by selecting a tensor that lies on the line joining the current iterate and the next iterate but is beyond the latter by a fraction .",
    "if the iterations happen to proceed in the direction of maximum likelihood gradient , it allows faster convergence by inducing greater leaps .",
    "additionally , it may also help in escaping limit cycles encountered during the iterations .",
    "we have also tested the reconstruction technique for photon creation in the case of inefficient detection .",
    "the output density matrices for the probe states were calculated using the beam splitter model of absorption @xcite . with these modified density matrices , we have generated test data using monte carlo simulations for @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "a comparison of the reconstructed process tensors is given in .",
    "finally , we investigated the effect of the dimension of the subspace of optical hilbert space chosen for the reconstruction , specifically for the photon creation process . in order to eliminate statistical errors in this reconstruction ,",
    "we directly used the marginal distributions instead of simulated quadrature data sets to obtain the values of @xmath120 in equations and .",
    "the performance criterion is taken to be the worst - case fidelity @xcite over the input space @xmath145 , defined as @xmath146 where @xmath6 is the actual process tensor and @xmath25 is the estimated process tensor .",
    "note that the photon number cutoff for the fidelity calculation is taken to be @xmath147 to ensure the hilbert space closure under photon addition .",
    "minimization over @xmath145 is carried out through a monte carlo simulation that involves introducing small random changes in the density matrix @xmath148 within @xmath145 and accepting the change whenever the value of the fidelity decreases .",
    "the solid line in ( a ) shows the worst - case fidelity versus @xmath91 for two values of @xmath92 . for each given @xmath94 ,",
    "the fidelity initially increases with @xmath91 as the truncation effects subside and decreases afterwards due to data insufficiency . the range of @xmath91 , over which the process tensor is reconstructed correctly , shifts towards the higher photon numbers with increasing @xmath92 owing to greater contribution of higher photon numbers in probe states of higher amplitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : hilbertsize](b , c ) further illustrates the two types of errors associated with the choice of the cut - off point . if @xmath91 is chosen too low ( ( b ) ) , truncation errors compromise the entire reconstructed process . if the reconstruction subspace is sufficient to accommodate all the input probe states and associated output states ( ( c ) ) , only the process tensor elements associated with high input photon numbers are reconstructed incorrectly . in this case , introducing a secondary cut - off at @xmath149 is justified .    the dashed lines in ( a ) display the advantages of the dual cut - off approach introduced in section [ pracsec ] .",
    "for example , with @xmath150 , optimal reconstruction is attained with the initial cut - off point @xmath151 and subsequent cropping of the process tensor with @xmath152 . with this approach ,",
    "the worst - case reconstruction fidelity is higher than for all cases with @xmath153 .",
    "note , however , that in most examples we studied , the dual cut - off method offers only a small advantage and may not be justified in practical csqpt .",
    "as evidenced by ( a ) , the secondary cut - off points should be chosen close to @xmath154 and @xmath155 , for @xmath156 and @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "these values are much higher than those calculated in the supplementary information to ref .",
    "@xcite . specifically , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite for the same values of @xmath158 would require the maximum coherent state amplitudes of 8 and 12 , respectively .",
    "further , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite requires @xmath159 probe states for reconstruction in a fock space of dimension @xmath160 , while our method poses no such constraints . in other words , for a given set of probe coherent states ( defined by their number and maximum amplitude @xmath92 ) , the present reconstruction method provides much more information about the process tensor than previous methods .",
