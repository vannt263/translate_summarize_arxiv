    "<S> a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 systems produced in the reaction @xmath2 at 18  gev/@xmath3 was carried out using an _ isobar _ model assumption . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is based on 3.0 m @xmath1 events and 2.6 m @xmath0 events and shows production of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> an earlier analysis of 250k @xmath0 events from the same experiment showed possible evidence for a @xmath7 exotic meson with a mass of 1.6  gev/@xmath8 decaying into @xmath9 . in this analysis of a higher statistics sample of the @xmath10 system in two charged modes we find no evidence of an exotic meson .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts a spectrum of _ hybrid _ mesons beyond the @xmath11 bound states of the conventional quark model in which the gluons binding the quarks manifest their degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> lattice qcd and qcd - inspired models predict that the gluonic field within the meson forms a flux tube for quark separation greater than 1  fermi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the flux tube is in its ground state conventional mesons emerge . </S>",
    "<S> when the flux - tube is in its excited states hybrid mesons emerge . for conventional mesons the spin ( @xmath12 ) , </S>",
    "<S> parity ( @xmath13 ) and charge conjugation ( @xmath14 ) quantum numbers of the @xmath11 system are those of a fermion  antifermion system : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angular momentum between the quarks and @xmath17 is the total quark spin ; @xmath18 ; and @xmath19 . thus @xmath20 are not allowed . </S>",
    "<S> these _ exotic _ quantum numbers are allowed when the quantum numbers of the excited flux - tube are included and are thus a signature for hybrid mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental interest in the spectrum and other properties ( decay modes and widths ) of hybrid mesons is that flux tubes are thought to be responsible for the confinement of quarks and gluons in qcd .    in 1998 , </S>",
    "<S> the e852 collaboration reported evidence for the @xmath21 , a @xmath7 exotic hybrid meson with a mass of 1.6  gev/@xmath8 decaying into @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the original publication @xcite of this result was followed by another @xcite giving more details of the analysis based on 250,000 events of the reaction @xmath22 at 18  gev/@xmath3 collected in the e852 experiment at brookhaven lab in 1994 . a search for this state by the ves collaboration in the reaction @xmath23 interactions at 37  </S>",
    "<S> gev/@xmath3 @xcite did not confirm this state . </S>",
    "<S> the partial wave analysis ( pwa ) procedure used to extract these results was based on the _ isobar _ model assumption whereby the final state @xmath24 system is reached via an intermediate state of a di - pion resonance ( _ e.g. _ @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) and a bachelor @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper reports on the analysis of additional data collected in 1995 including 3.0 m events of the reaction @xmath31 and 2.6 m events of the reaction @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the isobar model pwa of these two large data sets with each other and with the analysis presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the two @xmath10 modes provides powerful cross checks . </S>",
    "<S> any resonance decaying to @xmath32 should decay equally to @xmath33 and @xmath34 and thus appear with equal probabilities in the two modes . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , any resonance decay to @xmath35 ought to appear twice as often in @xmath36 as @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> and these same isospin rules dictate relationships between the two modes for all other decay sequences . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes rely on different elements of the detector , any misunderstandings in the acceptance would affect the two modes differently and inconsistencies would result . as the results will show , this is not the case .    </S>",
    "<S> the data reported on in this paper were collected in the e852 experiment at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) at brookhaven laboratory ( bnl ) using the multi - particle spectrometer ( mps ) augmented with a forward electromagnetic calorimeter ( lgd ) consisting of 3000  lead glass blocks . </S>",
    "<S> an 18.3  gev/@xmath3 @xmath38 beam was incident on a liquid hydrogen target . </S>",
    "<S> details about the e852 experiment are given elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the 1995 run of e852 collected approximately 146 m ( 265 m ) triggers requiring one ( three ) forward going charged particles . for those triggers requiring only one forward track </S>",
    "<S> , it was also required that the trigger processor @xcite detected an energy deposition pattern in the lgd consistent with an effective mass greater than a single @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic fitting program squaw @xcite was used in identifying approximately 73 m ( 79 m ) reconstructed events that were consistent with the topology @xmath40 . this constrained fit used the measured track and beam momenta , the measurements from the lgd and constraints on the recoil particle mass ( @xmath41 ) and di - photon effective masses ( two pairs @xmath42 ) to refine the measured final state particle 4-momenta . in the @xmath43 topology , 13.8 m events survived this selection while 16.8 m events of the @xmath44 topology survived . </S>",
    "<S> further cuts on fit confidence level , vertex position and correlation between the @xmath45 system and a recoil track produced the final data set analyzed here : 3,025,980 @xmath43events and 2,585,852 @xmath44events .    </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the acceptance uncorrected @xmath1 and @xmath46 effective mass distributions respectively . </S>",
    "<S> enhancements in the @xmath47 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mass regions are observed . the acceptance in @xmath45 effective mass is also shown in figures  [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> dalitz plots for the @xmath1 and @xmath46 systems in the @xmath5 mass region are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these dalitz plots clearly show rich structure and bands corresponding to decays into @xmath48 and @xmath49 , motivating application of the isobar model .    </S>",
    "<S> the pwa software used in this analysis consisted of programs developed at bnl and indiana university ( iu ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is similar to that used in @xcite but the details of handling the data and doing the the pwa fits differ . </S>",
    "<S> the iu software was optimized for running on a 200-processor computer cluster ( avidd ) @xcite allowing systematic studies involving many pwa fits , varying isobar parameters and using different wave sets . </S>",
    "<S> results from the two programs were compared with each other and found to be consistent . </S>",
    "<S> the iu programs were also used to analyze the data presented in @xcite and produced consistent results .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed in the gottfried - jackson frame . within the isobar formalism </S>",
    "<S> each partial wave is characterized by @xmath50 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the spin , parity and charge conjugation of the @xmath45 system , respectively , @xmath51 is the spin projection along the @xmath52 axis and @xmath53 represents symmetry of the @xmath45 system under reflection in the production plane . </S>",
    "<S> finally @xmath54 is the spin of the isobar and @xmath55 is the relative orbital angular momentum between the isobar and the bachelor @xmath30 . except for the @xmath56 wave </S>",
    "<S> , all @xmath57 resonances are parametrized using relativistic breit - wigner functions with blatt - weisskopf factors .    following @xcite a sufficient set of partial waves </S>",
    "<S> was determined by sequentially removing waves from a parent set containing waves with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 and examining the resulting change in likelihood . </S>",
    "<S> if no significant change in likelihood was obtained , the wave was removed . </S>",
    "<S> the exotic @xmath61 partial waves were kept even though they would have been chosen for removal by the above criteria  the existence of signals in these waves is discussed below . based on these criteria </S>",
    "<S> the compiled set includes 35 waves and a background wave we refer to this as the _ high wave _ set . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the wave set used in the analysis described in @xcite included 20 waves and a background wave  we refer to this as the _ low wave _ set . </S>",
    "<S> the 35 wave set included three additional @xmath62 , seven additional @xmath63 and seven additional @xmath64 waves this high wave set did not include two negative reflectivity partial waves ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) that were included in the low wave set pwa .    </S>",
    "<S> another arbiter of wave set sufficiency is the comparison of moments , @xmath67 , of the @xmath68 functions as calculated directly from the data and as calculated using the results of pwa fits . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the euler angles of the @xmath45 system @xcite and the intensity @xmath71 is determined directly from experiment or computed using the results of the pwa fits . in figure  [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the h(201 ) and h(420 ) moment comparisons as a function of @xmath45 mass for the @xmath72 channel for low wave and high wave set pwa fits . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the difference between data and pwa calculations of the moments as @xmath73 ( summing differences squared divided by errors squared summed over all mass bins and divided by the number of mass bins ) for various moments . </S>",
    "<S> similar plots are shown in figure  [ fig3 ] for the @xmath46 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the moments calculated using the pwa results from the high wave set have better agreement with experimental moments . </S>",
    "<S> but there are moments ( such as h(201 ) - shown in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig3 ] ) for which agreement is not achieved and this is most likely due to the inherent inadequacy of the isobar model in describing the underlying production mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the pwa fit results for the @xmath72 and @xmath74 channels respectively as a function of the @xmath45 effective mass . in part(a ) of each figure the sum of the waves is shown along with the background wave . </S>",
    "<S> the background wave is added incoherently with the other waves and is isotropic in all decay angles . </S>",
    "<S> the fitting procedure constrains the sum of all waves to describe the observed @xmath45 effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> parts ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) of each figure show the mass dependence of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 waves and their phase difference . results are shown for both the low wave and high wave set . to within 10% </S>",
    "<S> the acceptance corrected yields of @xmath77 in the two @xmath45 modes are equal , consistent with expected decays into @xmath78 and @xmath79 . and the yield for @xmath80 is higher by a factor of two for the @xmath81 modes when @xmath82 compared to @xmath83 , consistent with expectations from isospin . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath84 and @xmath85 waves and their phase difference are consistent with two interfering breit - wigner line shapes . for the @xmath85 wave in the @xmath74 channel ( figure  [ fig5](c ) ) </S>",
    "<S> we also show the published @xmath85 wave from the pwa of diffractive @xmath45 production in @xmath86 interactions at 63 and 94  gev/@xmath3 from the accmor collaboration @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath87 wave and its interference with the @xmath84 wave are shown in parts ( e ) and ( f ) of each figure . when the low wave set is used in the fit </S>",
    "<S> , an enhancement is observed for the exotic @xmath61 wave in the @xmath45 mass region around 1.6  gev/@xmath8 , consistent with the observation of @xcite  _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ we obtain the same results when we use the same wave set . </S>",
    "<S> but the enhancement disappears when the high wave set is used . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is observed for both @xmath45 channels . and </S>",
    "<S> the phase ( see part ( d ) ) of the exotic wave relative to the dominant @xmath84 wave is similar for both wave sets and dominated by the phase of the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the negative reflectivity exotic waves show the same behavior , disappearing as the fit improves .    </S>",
    "<S> the masses and widths of the @xmath88 and the @xmath28 were varied and the maximum likelihood was achieved using current best values for these quantities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different parameterizations of the @xmath89 s - wave were also examined @xcite . while small changes in the likelihood were observed , no systematic changes in the pwa results occurred . </S>",
    "<S> the pwa results presented here were for data with @xmath90  ( gev/@xmath3)@xmath91 where @xmath92 is the square of the momentum transferred from the incoming @xmath38 to the outgoing @xmath10 system . </S>",
    "<S> pwa fits were also carried out for 12 other regions in @xmath92 and the results are similar to those presented here .    in summary , there is no evidence for an exotic @xmath7 meson in the @xmath45 system and in particular for the @xmath21 . </S>"
