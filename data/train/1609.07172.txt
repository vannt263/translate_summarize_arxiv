    "@xcite recently discovered that ar sco is a m dwarf / white dwarf binary with an orbital period of 3.56 h and a white dwarf spin period of 1.95 m. the white dwarf s spin is slowing with a characteristic time @xmath2 y. most of the radiated power is emitted from the m dwarf near the l@xmath3 inner lagrange point .",
    "remarkably , the phase of maximum is displaced from conjunction by about 0.15 of the orbit .",
    "ar sco emits x - rays but they are only a small fraction of the system s luminosity , implying that it is not powered by accretion .",
    "spindown is the remaining plausible source of energy , with a power @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the white dwarf s moment of inertia and @xmath6 its rotation rate .",
    "the spindown power is converted to radiation with efficiency @xmath7% , several times the fraction of @xmath8 sterad subtended at the white dwarf by its companion .",
    "this excludes reprocessing of roughly isotropic radiation from the white dwarf as the source of the observed radiation . @xcite",
    "suggest the white dwarf s rotational energy is dissipated by interaction of its magnetic field with the m dwarf s atmosphere .",
    "the spectral energy distribution indicates a substantial contribution of synchrotron radiation , indicating nonthermal processes such as magnetic reconnection that accelerate energetic particles .",
    "the rapid spindown suggests that ar sco may be a missing link between synchronously rotating polars ( am her stars ) whose synchronism is maintained by magnetostatic interaction @xcite to extreme accuracy @xcite and the asynchronous intermediate polars ( ip ) . because ar sco is still far from synchronism the rate of dissipation of its white dwarf s rotational energy is much greater than that in almost - synchronous systems like v1500 cyg @xcite .    in at least one other ip ,",
    "ae aqr @xcite , synchronization is also the chief source of energy and radio emission indicates particle acceleration .",
    "the photometry of ae aqr is complicated by its flaring , but the amplitude of the periodic modulation is low and is explicable as an ellipsoidal variation without evidence of a reflection effect or other interaction with the white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the secondary star of ae aqr is of earlier spectral type ( k4v ) than that of ar sco ( m5v ) and likely intrinsically more luminous , reducing the effect of magnetic heating on the light curve .",
    "ar sco and ae aqr may be members of a class of synchronars , magnetic binaries whose emission is powered by the synchronization of their compact ( white dwarf ) asynchronously rotating components .",
    "ar sco is an extreme example in which the contribution of intrinsic stellar and accretional luminosity is particularly small .",
    "the visible brightness of ar sco does not peak at conjunction ( orbital phase @xmath9 ) , when we might expect to see the heated side of the m dwarf most fully .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the origin of this surprising observation .",
    "i consider two hypotheses :    1 .",
    "the power dissipated by interaction between the white dwarf s magnetic field and the m dwarf is greater on the latter s `` upstream '' face where a bow wave may form ( fig .",
    "[ arscof1 ] ) than on its `` downstream '' face .",
    "the dissipation rate does not depend on orbital phase but we view the hottest portion of the m star more fully before conjunction .",
    "the white dwarf s spin axis is not aligned with the orbital axis and its magnetic moment is not aligned with its spin axis . the dissipation rate in the m dwarf s atmosphere depends on the orbital phase ( fig .",
    "[ arscof2 ] ) .",
    "precession of the spin axis makes the orbital phase of maximum drift .    in either hypothesis",
    "the optical maximum is displaced from conjunction . in the first hypothesis it precedes conjunction if the white dwarf spin is prograde ( and follows it if retrograde ) . in the second hypothesis",
    "any phase is possible , but precession makes it recede ( if the spin is prograde ) .",
    "the white dwarf s field is moving past the m dwarf at a speed @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the separation of the stars .",
    "this is fast enough ( 1520% of @xmath12 ) to induce an asymmetry in the magnetic interaction between the `` upstream '' and `` downstream '' faces of the m dwarf , even though there is not expected to be a particle wind from the white dwarf . the white dwarf s magnetic field is an electromagnetic wind , even inside the radiation zone ( though not deep in the near zone , close to the white dwarf , where a magnetostatic treatment should be valid ) .",
    "more energy is released in a bow wave on the upstream side .",
    "the figure shows a magnetic moment misaligned with the white dwarf s spin axis , but this is not necessary ; an upstream / downstream asymmetry and a torque would occur even if the orbital , spin and magnetic axes were parallel , provided @xmath13.,width=326 ]     the white dwarf s spin @xmath14 makes an angle @xmath15 with the orbital axis , and the spin axis precesses .",
    "if the magnetic moment is oblique ( shown here as perpendicular ) to the spin axis , as indicated by the large amplitude modulation at the sideband of the spin frequency , the magnetic field is maximum in a broad fan , indicated by dashed lines , around the rotational equator , and dissipation is maximum at orbital phases when the m dwarf ( shown at three orbital phases ) is in that fan . in the figure that occurs at @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( at @xmath17",
    "the heated surface is not visible to the observer).,width=326 ]    in contrast to the white dwarf pulsar model of @xcite , i do not assume a wind from either star .",
    "neither white dwarfs nor m dwarfs are known to emit winds , and their low intrinsic luminosities argue against the existence of such winds with significant density .",
    "rather , i attribute the dissipation to the interaction of the white dwarf s vacuum magnetic field with the m dwarf s atmosphere .",
    "this interaction occurs , and the dissipation rate varies with orbital phase , shifting maximum light from conjunction , even if the white dwarf s rotation and magnetic axes are aligned , although that alignment is excluded in ar sco because of the large amplitude modulation at the sideband of the spin period .",
    "the hypothesis that the white dwarf is spinning down as a rotating magnetic dipole in vacuum may be rejected because it requires excessive magnetic fields . equating the spin - down power @xmath18 to the radiated power @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the angle between the spin and rotational axes",
    ", @xmath21 is the white dwarf s moment of inertia and its spindown rate @xmath22 s@xmath23 , gives the magnetic moment @xmath24 the polar magnetic field @xmath25 numerical evaluation ( table  [ bpolar ] ) yields fields outside the range of observed white dwarf fields and therefore implausible .",
    ".[bpolar ] implied magnetic moments @xmath26 and polar fields @xmath27 if the spindown of ar sco is attributed to vacuum magnetic dipole radiation by a magnetized white dwarf of the indicated masses .",
    "significantly lower masses are excluded by orbital analysis @xcite .",
    "white dwarf parameters are taken from table  [ wddata ] . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the remarkable properties of ar sco support the suggestion of @xcite that it differs from most intermediate polars in that it is powered by synchronization of the white dwarf spin with the orbital motion ( a `` synchronar '' ) rather than by accretion .",
    "the displacement of the optical maximum from conjunction implies that energy is deposited asymmetrically on the surface of the m dwarf .",
    "this may be explained either as a consequence of the subrelativistic speed of the rotating white dwarf magnetosphere at the m dwarf or of a white dwarf spin axis that is oblique to the orbital axis . in the former hypothesis",
    "the orbital phase of maximum is likely to be fixed ; in the latter hypothesis the spin axis precesses with a period of decades , producing a drift in the orbital phase of maximum .",
    "ar sco differs from most intermediate polars because accretion contributes only a small fraction , perhaps none , of its luminosity .",
    "this is likely attributable to a more magnetized white dwarf in ar sco .",
    "ar sco also differs from non - accreting binary ( neutron star ) pulsars with nondegenerate companions because the binary pulsars companions are in the radiation zone of the pulsars dipole fields , so any interaction between the companion and the dipole field does not couple back to the pulsar s rotation ; energy may be deposited in the companion , but the pulsar despins as an isolated object .",
