    "<S> ( c ) 2d array , with the field inside the ( physical ) plane generated by an arbitrary laser phase pattern.[fig : gaugefieldsyntheticdimension ] ]    so far we have analyzed schemes to engineer hopping phases for photons . </S>",
    "<S> we now ask about situations where the phonons are not only employed as auxiliary virtual excitations , but rather occur as real excitations , which can be interconverted with the photons . </S>",
    "<S> this means , in addition to the modes making up the lattices described above ( in either of the two schemes ) , we now consider on - site vibrational modes @xmath93 coupled optomechanically to the corresponding optical modes @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> using the standard approach @xcite , we arrive at a linearized optomechanical interaction of the form @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to be general ( and generate nontrivial features connected to the gauge field structure ) , we will assume the neighboring phonon modes may also be coupled , as described by a tight - binding hamiltonian of the form @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> when discussing the effects of gauge fields in such a setting , the system is best understood within the concept of synthetic dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the optomechanical interaction can be viewed in terms of an extension of the 1d or 2d lattice into such an additional synthetic dimension . in our case , this dimension only has two discrete locations , corresponding to photons vs. phonons . in that picture , the optomechanical interaction , converting photons to phonons , corresponds to a simple hopping between sites along the additional direction . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : gaugefieldsyntheticdimension ] ( a ) sketches this for an optomechanical ring : photons and phonons represent two layers separated along the synthetic dimension . applying any of our two previously discussed schemes , a photon hopping from site @xmath97 to @xmath98 will acquire a phase @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge field @xmath5 must now be viewed as a vector field in this new 3d space , where one of the dimensions is synthetic . </S>",
    "<S> a finite hopping phase @xmath18 at one of the optical links creates a magnetic flux through the optical plaquette as desired , see fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gaugefieldsyntheticdimension ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , and this is the important point , since the magnetic field @xmath3 is divergence - free , the field must penetrate at least one additional plaquette , causing the opposite magnetic flux in the synthetic dimension ( assuming @xmath100 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in general , realizing that there is this kind of behaviour is crucial to avoid puzzles about seeming violations of gauge symmetry in situations with photon magnetic fields in optomechanical arrays . </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to keep track of the full vector potential in the space that includes the synthetic dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> we now take a step back , getting rid of the previously discussed engineered schemes that required two lasers and some arrangement of link modes . rather we will consider simple optomechanical arrays , i.e. lattices of optical and vibrational modes , with photon and phonon tunnel coupling between modes and with the optomechanical interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we ask : what is the effect of an arbitrary , spatially varying optical phase field in the driving laser that sets the strength of the optomechanical coupling ? </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the resulting spatially varying phase of the optomechanical coupling , @xmath101 , can be chosen to create arbitrary magnetic fields perpendicular to the synthetic dimension . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly simple example is a simple linear chain of optomechanical cells . shining a tilted laser ( i.e. with a phase gradient , @xmath102 ) onto such a 1d optomechanical array creates a constant magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the `` optomechanical synthetic ladder '' that can be drawn to understand the situation , cf . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : gaugefieldsyntheticdimension ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum mechanics of excitations tunneling between the two rails of the ladder ( corresponding to photon - phonon conversion ) is directly analogous to experiments on electron tunneling between parallel wires in a magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field shifts the momenta of the tunneling particles , giving rise to resonance phenomena when the shifted dispersion curves @xmath103 of the excitations match . via phase front engineering one could create arbitrary synthetic magnetic fields also in 2d grids , see figure [ fig : gaugefieldsyntheticdimension](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note , though , that this method is constrained since it can not create directly magnetic fluxes through optical or mechanical plaquettes , and in general only the schemes discussed above provide full flexibility . on the other hand , if either the photon or phonon modes are occupied only virtually , then effective fluxes can still be generated for the remaining real excitations , even with a single laser , and this works best for phonons ( see @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the most salient aspects of the experimental realization . </S>",
    "<S> both the butterfly optical spectrum and spatially resolved transport can be probed using homodyne techniques , which are insensitive to noise . </S>",
    "<S> real - space optical imaging is feasible , as the defects are a few micrometers apart . </S>",
    "<S> the optical phase pattern can be engineered using spatial light modulators . </S>",
    "<S> no time - dependent changes of the pattern are needed here , since the time - dependence is generated via the beat - note between the two laser beams .    for the modulated - link scheme , the mechanical oscillation amplitude @xmath104 used for the modulation should overwhelm any thermal fluctuations . in the example of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : optomechanicalbutterfly ] , we assumed @xmath105 . at recently achieved parameters @xcite @xmath106 and @xmath107 , </S>",
    "<S> this would imply @xmath108 , i.e. a phonon number of @xmath109 reached by driving , certainly larger than the thermal population . if we drive the mechanical vibration using a radiation pressure force oscillating at resonance ( assuming the quoted @xmath110 also for the optical mode used in that driving ) , then we have @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the circulating photon number and @xmath113 the mechanical damping rate . </S>",
    "<S> given a mechanical quality factor of @xmath114 , this requires @xmath115 photons for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : optomechanicalbutterfly ] , a realistic number . </S>",
    "<S> we note that thermal fluctuations of the mechanical amplitude give rise to a fractional deviation of @xmath116 in @xmath60 , with a slow drift on the time scale @xmath117 . at typical temperatures used in experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath118 , and so the fractional change is on the order of a percent , which will not noticeably impact transport .    in the alternative wavelength - conversion scheme , one should strive for a large photon - enhanced optomechanical coupling rate @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> a general estimate implies we always need the photon number to be larger than @xmath120 in order to see the butterfly spectrum and the transport effects . </S>",
    "<S> this condition ( compatible with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : transportinuniformmagneticfield ] ) would require a circulating photon number of around @xmath121 for the parameters demonstrated in a recent successful wavelength conversion setup based on optomechanical crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to estimate the unwanted influx of thermal excitations from the phonon subsystem into the photon subsystem , at least if the setup is to be applied in the quantum regime , for observing the transport of _ single _ photons in the presence of a magnetic field . in the wavelength - conversion scheme , </S>",
    "<S> there is a detuning @xmath122 between the red sideband of the laser and the phonon mode , such that photon - phonon conversion is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it still happens at a rate @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the `` cooling rate '' ( for the detuned case applicable here ) and @xmath125 is the number of phonons in the mode . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , this phonon number is also reduced by the very same off - resonant cooling process . </S>",
    "<S> balancing the inflow and outflow of excitations , we find that there will be a remaining unwanted photon occupation of @xmath126 due to the conversion of thermal phonons into photons , where @xmath127 is the bulk thermal phonon occupation . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath128 suppresses this number strongly , and it should be possible to reach the regime @xmath129 in low - temperature setups .    reducing fabrication - induced disorder will be crucial for any future applications of photonic crystals , including the one envisaged here ( as well as other photonic magnetic field schemes ) . in first experimental attempts , </S>",
    "<S> the optical and mechanical disorder is on the percent level , which makes especially the fluctuations of the optical resonance frequencies significant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , strong reductions of the disorder will be possible by post - fabrication methods @xcite , such as local laser - induced oxidation . </S>",
    "<S> these are expected to reduce the fluctuations down to the level of @xmath130 relative optical frequency fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is enough to suppress the optical disorder to some fraction of the photon hopping rate @xmath131 , which will enable near - ideal photon transport ( e.g. anderson localization lengths would be at least hundreds of sites , larger than the typical arrays ) . </S>",
    "<S> disorder in the mechanical frequencies can be reduced by similar techniques , but is much less problematic , due to the difference in absolute frequency scales between optics and mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> _ outlook _ - optomechanical crystals represent an interesting system for the realization of artificial photonic magnetic fields due to their all - optical controllability </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , their rich non - linear ( quantum ) dynamics @xcite could be explored in the presence of an artificial magnetic field . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the very flexible optical control could be used to create and explore novel features , e.g. varying the optomechanical coupling strength spatially and/or temporally , both adiabatically and with sudden quenches . moreover , </S>",
