    "nanoscopic magnetic arrays have been proposed recently as devices of ultrahigh - density information storage @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was announced recently @xcite that an array of bistable magnetic wires can display a complex behavior .",
    "namely , the authors discussed the effect of self - organized criticality ( commonly abbreviated as soc ) @xcite .",
    "the problem is that a system in the critical state can not be used to store any information , because a flip of one magnetic moment can change the magnetic structure of the whole array .",
    "the aim of this work is to check by means of a computer simulation if the array is indeed in the critical state .",
    "the values of the simulation parameters are selected as close as possible to the experimental system described in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the total magnetization , i.e. its time dependence in the presence of the oscillating magnetic field , is governed by two agents : the long - range magnetostaticinteraction between each two elements of the array , and the switching field(coercive field ) , which varies from one element to another .",
    "the nonzeroswitching field enables to preserve information in the array at positive temperatures .",
    "the interaction leads to flips of magnetic moments and theinformation  otherwise frozen in the array  is destroyed , at leastpartially .",
    "let us recall the characteristic features of soc .",
    "according to an illuminating paperby flyvbjerg @xcite , excitations wandering in a system can lead it to a self - organized state , i.e. a spontaneously formed state far from thermalequilibrium . by criticality we mean that in this state , excitations can be of any order of magnitude .",
    "in fact there is no characteristic scale in a criticalstate : the array is scale - free in the same way as a cluster of spins `` up '' in a ferromagnet at its curie temperature .",
    "basically , we search for excitations which spread over the lattice .",
    "the technique applied is known as damage spreading @xcite .",
    "it is believed , that if soc is present in a system , a local variation of its structure can lead to a global change @xcite .",
    "then , existence of such a spreading is an argument for the presence of criticality . on the other hand , one of the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the calculation of the box - counting fractal dimension @xcite of the cluster of elements with a given orientation of magnetic moments .",
    "that is why we investigate also this fractal dimension .",
    "our simulations concentrate on the nanoscopic array described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "monodomain magnetic cylinders of nickel , 57  nm of diameter and 115  nm length , form a square array with the period @xmath1  nm . the magnetization is @xmath2 emu/@xmath3 .",
    "the mean switching field of one element is @xmath4 oe , with the standard deviation @xmath5oe .",
    "the switching field is constant in time for each element .",
    "the magnetostatic interaction is calculated by means of the rectangular prism approximation formula @xcite .",
    "the only modification introduced to the investigation of soc are the periodic boundary conditions , to avoid boundaries which could alter the results .",
    "the dynamics of the system is simulated by means of the pardavi - horvath ( ph ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "initial parameters of this algorithm are an external magnetic field @xmath6 , the magnetic states of each element of the array and their switching fields @xmath7 . at the begining usually @xmath8 and",
    "the magnetic states of the elements are random . then for every element of the array , the interaction field @xmath9 can be calculated which comes from other elements .",
    "the numbers which represent this interaction field are preserved in the computer memory .",
    "after that an element is sought which is most wiling to flip .",
    "this element has to fulfil three conditions :    1 .",
    "magnetization of this element must have opposite direction to the total field @xmath10 exerted on this element ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "2 .   total field must have greater value than the switching field of the element ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "3 .   this element has maximal value of difference between the total field exerted on the element and its switching field .",
    "the selected element is fliped , and all numbers which represent the interaction fields are corrected by the change of the interaction field coming from the flipped element .",
    "+ this procedure is repeated until no one element can be flipped .",
    "then , the external field is changed .",
    "subsequent changes of this field are of the values which make possible a flip of at least one element .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated .",
    "finally the hysteresis loop of the whole array is obtained .",
    "the algorithm is checked by the calculation of thehysteresis loop ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and a comparison with the experimental one @xcite  the accordance is quantitative and good .",
    "the damage spreading technique is applied for an array of @xmath13 elements .",
    "two arrays are stored simultanously in the computer memory , in the same randomly selected initial state .",
    "the ph procedure is applied to lead these arrays to stable ( stationary ) states , where no flips occur .",
    "then , one magnetic moment is flipped in one array , and wecheck if the flip is stable .",
    "subsequently we apply a periodic magnetic field of amplitude @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the case of small frequency , where the whole arrays go to stable states each time before the field is varied . in this case",
    "a particular value of the frequency is not relevant .",
    "the damage is defined as the hamming distance between two arrays , defined as the number of elements of the arrays with opposite directions of the magnetic moments .",
    "the result is that the hamming distance increases only during some transient time .",
    "then , the system reaches a limit cycle , with the length equal to some multiple of the period of the applied field .",
    "a typical result is shown in fig .",
    "we note that if a system is critical , the size of damages should increase until the system boundaries are reached @xcite . in our case damages remain limited to a closed area at the lattice center .",
    "the size @xmath15 of this maximal damage has a maximum for the amplitude of the applied field @xmath14 close to 1300 oe , and it vanishes in most cases for @xmath16 oe .",
    "it is obvious that any damage must disappearat strong fields , when the system is saturated .",
    "besides , @xmath15 varies strongly from a sample to asample . as a rule",
    ", the damage is localized as a shapeless and seemingly random pattern of the array elements , formed of several clusters , separated but close to each other .",
    "\\(a ) + ( b )    the fractal dimension @xmath17 of the cluster of the `` up '' ( or `` down '' ) oriented elements is calculated for the @xmath18 array.obviously , the investigated magnetic state of the system should not be arbitrary , but it should be a consequence of the physical properties and processes . for a random initial state the fractal dimension @xmath17 is equal to 2.0 , what means that the system has no fractal character.on the other hand , such a state is an artifact of the ( pseudo)random numbers generator , and therefore it can not be treated as realistic.the only physical condition of such a state is its stability , but in our opinion this condition leaves too much freedom . therefore we have calculated the time evolution of the fractal dimension @xmath17 during the virtually performed hysteresis experiment .",
    "it is obvious , that @xmath19 or @xmath20 in the saturated states .",
    "we found that this bistable character of @xmath17 is preserved also for small amplitude @xmath14 of the applied external field . between these two values ,",
    "the scaling is not proper .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) . typically , a part of the curve for small size of the box shows the inclination close to zero , and another part  close to two .",
    "similar plots have been presented also in refs .",
    "@xcite . as the applied field changes ,",
    "the bent part of the curve is shifted left and finally disappears .",
    "in fact , plots like fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) appear when we try to assign the fractal character to a random configuration of spins .",
    "we demonstrate it in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , where the magnetic configuration of the array produces the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "surely , this cluster does not exhibit any self - similarity .",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath17 obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite is @xmath21 , which is close to non - fractal value 2.0 . on the other hand , in the ising ferromagnet at the curie point @xmath22 @xcite",
    "then , the value of @xmath17 itself does not allow to state if the system is in the critical state .",
    "however , the criterion of criticality can be drawn from the obtained curve .",
    "its bent character means that there is a characteristic length in the investigated structure .",
    "the value of this length is just at x coordinate of the bend point .",
    "we demonstrate it in fig .",
    "[ isi_fd ] .",
    "the two curves are obtained with the same box - counting technique for the conventional ising ferromagnet .",
    "the curve for temperature close to the @xmath23 is a fairly straight line , except its upper part where a continuous deviation from linearity is observed .",
    "this deviation can be assigned to a short waiting time ( equivalent to @xmath24 ) , which should be very large in the critical region , and to a finiteness of the system .",
    "the curve obtained for @xmath25 displays the same characteristic length , as in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a).this is an indication , that the system is not scale - free , and therefore not in a critical state .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the results obtained by means of the damage - spreading technique . in all cases",
    "investigated , we have not observed a damage which reaches the boundaries of the system .",
    "however , this conclusion is valid only for the system investigated experimentally in ref .",
    "we stress this point because there are serious differences between the this system and the model system discussed in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the latter the lattice is triangular , what makes the system frustrated because of the antiferromagnetic - like character of the magnetostatic interaction .",
    "frustration enhances both the ground state energy and its degeneration .",
    "the system can wander in the phase space , and therefore damages can spread more easily .",
    "then , the existence of soc in an array with the triangular structure remains to be checked .",
    "the numerical calculations were partially carried out in ack - cyfronet - agh .",
    "the machine time is financed by the ministry of scientific research and information technology in poland , grant no .",
