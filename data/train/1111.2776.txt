    "co low-@xmath4 transitions have been widely observed in studies of molecular clouds and bipolar outflows .",
    "these lines , e.g. , co ( 10 ) and ( 21 ) , are easily excited at very low temperatures and mostly trace relatively cold molecular gas . observations of high-@xmath4 co lines , in particular those falling in the thz frequency regime ( @xmath5 ) , are very rare .",
    "these highly excited lines can be observed with spaceborne observatories , e.g. , infrared space observatory @xcite and most recently , _",

    "ground - based thz observations , which can provide better angular resolutions down to a few arc seconds , are challenging even on extremely dry sites .",
    "to date only a very few ground telescopes have successfully obtained astronomical thz co spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , all these observations were carried out targeting one or a few points in an observed region , and had coarse spectral and/or spatial resolutions .",

    "therefore , morphological and kinematical information of the gas probed by thz co lines is missing .    as part of the science demonstration observations of the new thz receiver on apex",
    ", we mapped the co ( 98 ) ( 1.037 thz ) emission in ngc 6334 i , the brightest far - ir source in a relatively nearby ( 1.7 kpc , * ? ? ?",

    "the co ( 98 ) line was observed with a relatively high angular resolution .",
    "the line has an upper level energy ( @xmath7 ) lying @xmath1250 k above the ground and a critical density ( @xmath8 ) of order @xmath9 @xmath3 , thus is sensitive to hot and dense gas in shocked regions .",
    "in addition , the co ( 43 ) line was simultaneously obtained with the dual - frequency receiver , enabling excitation analysis without significant effect from calibration uncertainties .",
    "the observations were conducted on 2010 july 9 , with @xmath10.25 mm precipitable water vapor , using a dual - frequency receiver system on apex .",
    "the receiver system includes a 1 thz channel , a copy of _",
    "band iv , and a co - aligned 460 ghz channel , designed for pointing purpose @xcite .",
    "two fast fourier transform spectrometers , based on the design presented by klein et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , were configured to provide a spectral resolution of 122 khz ( @xmath10.08 kms@xmath10 ) over a 1.6 ghz bandwidth for the 460 ghz channel and a resolution of 183 khz ( @xmath10.053 kms@xmath10 ) over a 2.4 ghz bandwidth for the 1 thz channel .",
    "the system temperatures were around 360 k at 460 ghz and 2100 k at 1 thz .",
    "the beam efficiencies were determined to be @xmath11 and @xmath12 at 460 ghz and 1 thz , respectively , by observing mars and uranus .",
    "we performed on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping observations , covering an area of about @xmath13 .",
    "guided by the outflow elongation revealed by previous low-@xmath4 co observations , the long axis of the mapping area was tilted by @xmath14 east of north .",
    "the effective integration time on each grid of the otf map was 13 s. we pointed every hour toward ( r.a . ,",
    "decl.)@xmath15 ) , the peak position of the brightest 1.3 mm source ( i.e. , i - sma1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the region , with the 460 ghz channel in the continuum mode .",
    "furthermore , we constructed a pseudo 1 thz continuum map by averaging the line - free channels over an effective bandwidth of @xmath11.5 ghz , compared that pseudo continuum with a 345 ghz continuum map ( convolved to the apex beam of @xmath0 ) obtained from recent submillimeter array observations ( q zhang , priv . comm . ) , and shifted the final maps by about @xmath16 to match the high - accuracy 345 ghz peak at ( r.a . , decl.)@xmath17 ) . only co ( 98 ) emission is clearly detected in the thz channel . in the 460 ghz channel ,",
    "several lines are seen toward the 345 ghz continuum peak , but no line contamination is evident over the full observed velocity extent of the co ( 43 ) emission . unless specified , the data are presented in @xmath18 scales . for a smoothed spectral resolution of 2 kms@xmath10 ,",
    "the rms noise levels are 0.27 k in co ( 98 ) and 0.05 k in co ( 43 ) .",
    "complementary irac 38 @xmath19 m images were retrieved from the _ spitzer _ archive ( program i d : 30154 ) .",
    "we use the post basic calibrated data products produced by the _ spitzer _",
    "science center pipeline s18.7.0 .",
    "the co ( 98 ) and ( 43 ) emission arising from the outflowing gas is detected with very high - velocity line wings , reaching lsr velocities @xmath20 kms@xmath10 in the blueshifted lobe and @xmath21 kms@xmath10 in the redshifted lobe ( the ambient cloud velocity is about @xmath22 kms@xmath10 ) .",
    "figure [ co98int ] shows the emission integrated in three velocity intervals , which are referred as the slow - wing ( s - wing ) , fast - wing ( f - wing ) , and extremely high - velocity ( ehv ) components following the terminology of tafalla et al .",
    "focusing on the high - resolution co ( 98 ) maps , a bipolar outflow centered around the trapezium - like millimeter continuum sources is clearly detected .",
    "provided a pointing uncertainty of 23@xmath23 , we refrain from an identification of the outflow driving source from the millimeter sources .",
    "the outflow extends about 0.5 pc from the northeast ( ne ) to southwest ( sw ) , in an orientation consistent with low- to mid-@xmath4 co observations .",
    "a blueshifted structure extending from the millimeter sources to the northwest also shows ehv emission , and is likely attributed to another outflow .",
    "since the feature extends beyond our mapping area , it is not further analyzed in this work .",
    "figures [ spectra](a ) , [ spectra](b ) show the co ( 98 ) and ( 43 ) spectra extracted toward the outer peak on each of the blue- and redshifted lobes ( marked as `` b '' and `` r '' in figure [ co98int ] ) .",
    "the two transitions have similar profiles : the s - wing component has its brightness fast decreasing as the velocity increases ; the f - wing component appears as a plateau with relatively flat brightness variation ; the ehv component has greater co ( 98)/(43 ) ratios , and shows a secondary peak in the blueshifted lobe .",
    "the co ( 98)/(43 ) ratios averaged within each of the three velocity intervals are measured to be 0.70 ( s - wing ) , 0.69 ( f - wing ) , 0.92 ( ehv ) toward `` b '' and 0.79 ( s - wing ) , 0.81 ( f - wing ) , 0.92 ( ehv ) toward `` r '' . again , greater ratios are found in the ehv component , which imply a higher excitation condition for the ehv gas .",
    "we performed large - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) calculations on the line ratios using the radex code @xcite .",
    "figure [ spectra](c ) shows the co ( 98)/(43 ) ratios as a function of gas density and kinetic temperature .",
    "the adopted co column density to line width ratio is @xmath24 @xmath25/(kms@xmath10 ) , corresponding to a total column density on the order of @xmath26 @xmath25 as constrained by leurini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on @xmath27co observations .",
    "the calculations show that for the observed range of line ratios , the gas density is @xmath28 @xmath3 and the temperature is @xmath29 k. to further constrain the physical conditions of the outflowing gas , it is instructive to adopt a typical co abundance of @xmath30 and assume that the gas dimension along the light - of - sight is similar to that in the plane - of - sky . in this situation the co column density and h@xmath31 density are connected by a size scale , and that scale is used to estimate the beam filling factor .",
    "we then ran a series of lvg models exploring the parameter space of kinetic temperature , h@xmath31 density , and co column density , and compared the brightness temperatures predicted by the models with the corrected antenna temperatures ( @xmath32 divided by a beam filling factor ) .",
    "we find that the models with a density of @xmath12@xmath33 @xmath3 and a kinetic temperature of @xmath1400 k appear to reasonably agree with the observed ehv emission , while the models with a similar density but a lower temperature of @xmath1300 k are able to reproduce the s - wing / f - wing emission .",
    "figure [ spitzer ] shows a comparison between the co ( 98 ) emission and shock activities probed by mid - ir and nh@xmath34 maser observations . in figure [ spitzer](a ) , the _ spitzer _",
    "three - color composite image reveals a pair of bow - shaped tips around the co ( 98 ) peaks in excess 4.5 @xmath19 m ( _ green _ ) emission , which often traces jets and bow - shocks in protostellar outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several authors have detected 2.12 @xmath19 m h@xmath31 knots in this region @xcite .",
    "two bow - shaped h@xmath31 knots along the co outflow axis ( denoted  @xmath35  and  @xmath36  in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coincide with the 4.5 @xmath19 m emission knots reported here .",
    "this suggests that the excess 4.5 @xmath19 m emission can be mostly due to shocked h@xmath31 lines @xcite , but the contribution from co @xmath37=10 or hi br@xmath35 lines can not be ruled out without spectroscopic observations .",
    "furthermore , figure [ spitzer](b ) shows the 4.5 @xmath19 m to 3.6 @xmath19 m emission ratio to highlight the shocked emission @xcite .",
    "while field stars have the brighter emission falling in the 3.6 @xmath19 m band , shocked emission appears most prominent in the 4.5 @xmath19 m band , thus figure [ spitzer](b ) not only shows the bow - shaped tips seen in figure [ spitzer](a ) but also unveils a new feature which is suppressed in figure [ spitzer](a ) by a nearby bright star .",
    "each of the three 4.5 @xmath19 m excess features is associated with an nh@xmath34 ( 3,3 ) maser spot @xcite .",
    "compared to the 1st moment ( intensity - weighted velocity ) map of the co ( 98 ) emission , the shocked features seen in ir and maser emission coincide with the outer parts of the outflow lobes where most of the gas moves at high velocities .",
    "the most surprising result of our observations is the detection of high - velocity co ( 98 ) emission ( f - wing and ehv ) over a spatial extent of order 0.5 pc .",
    "this provides direct evidence for the presence of a highly - excited component in a bipolar outflow .",
    "the dynamical timescale of the co ( 98 ) outflow , derived from the flow radius of @xmath10.22 pc divided by the outflow terminal velocity of @xmath177 kms@xmath10 @xcite , is about @xmath38 yr .",
    "this agrees with previous estimates of 2@xmath39 yr based on the co ( 21 ) , ( 32 ) , and ( 43 ) observations @xcite .",
    "therefore the outflow is very young , preferring an evolutionary stage prior to the formation of an uc hii region for its driving source .",
    "compared to the mid - ir and nh@xmath34 maser observations , the outflow seems to be closely related to bow shocks .",
    "the co ( 98 ) observations have a @xmath40 resolution , allowing us to further explore the kinematics of the outflow and its driving mechanism .",
    "figure [ pvplot ] shows the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram of the co ( 98 ) emission , constructed approximately along the outflow axis .",
    "overall , the outflow velocities ( relative to the ambient cloud velocity ) are greater at positions farther away from the central source .",
    "such a velocity structure is also discernable in the 1st - moment map shown in figure [ spitzer](b ) . in particular",
    ", the maximum velocities in the redshifted lobe roughly linearly increase with the distances from the central source , following a `` hubble '' law .",
    "theoretically , outflows forming from jet - driven bow shocks have been shown to exhibit hubble - like p - v relations , where the forward velocities of the gas around the bow s head are greater than along the bow wings @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , stahler ( 1994 ) obtained the hubble p - v relation in a model of ambient gas entrained by a turbulent jet .",
    "however , as pointed out by lada & fich ( 1996 ) , a critical assumption of stahler s calculation is that the gas mass in every slab perpendicular to the jet axis has the same power - law distribution with velocity , which is not seen in our co ( 98 ) or ( 43 ) data .",
    "the p - v pattern we observe is very similar to that reproduced by the bow - shock calculations of zhang & zheng ( 1997 ) and simulations of smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and downes & ray ( 1999 ) .",
    "we also note that the p - v pattern shown in figure [ pvplot ] closely resembles that of the ngc 2264 g outflow , which is a class 0 outflow driven by a precessing jet @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bow - shaped tips seen in the ir independently suggest the association between bow shocks and the co ( 98 ) emission .",
    "thus , we suggest that the gas probed by the co ( 98 ) line wings is accelerated by bow shocks created by a jet impacting the ambient material . the nature of the ehv gas , however , is less clear . from figure [ spectra ] , the terminal velocities of the ehv component reach @xmath41 kms@xmath10 if the projection effect is taken into account .",
    "non - dissociative c - type shocks are expected to accelerate ambient gas to velocities up to @xmath42 kms@xmath10 .",
    "a recent chemical investigation of ehv low - mass outflows challenges the hypothesis that molecules in ehv gas reform behind dissociative j - type shocks @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the ehv gas has an origin close to the central source rather than being accelerated ambient gas @xcite .",
    "most low-@xmath4 co observations of molecular outflows show power - law intensity - velocity ( i - v ) relations , @xmath43 , with the power - law index , @xmath44 , typically around 2 and in some cases steepening to larger values at velocities higher than 1030 kms@xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the line wings are optically thin and the co abundance and excitation temperature do not vary much , as assumed in many studies , the shape of i - v plots represents mass - velocity distributions ( see , e.g. , a compilation by * ? ? ?",
    "the i - v property provides an important test for models of molecular outflow acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure [ mvplot ]",
    ", we plot the spatially integrated co ( 98 ) intensity as a function of velocity . for @xmath45 kms@xmath10 ,",
    "the intensity distribution can be described by power - laws with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the blue- and redshifted lobes , respectively . at higher velocities ,",
    "the intensity rapidly drops , and the power - law fits give @xmath48 ( blue ) and @xmath49 ( red ) .",
    "the i - v relation in co ( 43 ) is similar , with @xmath50 in each lobe up to @xmath51 kms@xmath10 and steepening further out .",
    "in addition , ridge & moore ( 2001 ) reported @xmath52 for @xmath53 kms@xmath10 with the co ( 21 ) observations of this outflow .",
    "thus , the i - v relation of the ngc 6334 i outflow , measured in low- to high-@xmath4 co lines for velocities up to @xmath51 kms@xmath10 , appears to be among the shallowest known and is shallower than most theoretical predictions ( see a recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of collimated outflows driven by dense jets predict @xmath44 close to 1 ( jet to ambient gas density ratio set to 10 , * ? ? ?",
    "but the thrust of the simulated jets can only drive low - mass outflows , and the @xmath54 power - law in the simulations occurs at velocities up to 10 kms@xmath10 , far lower than the value observed here ( 55 kms@xmath10 ) .",
    "it is therefore yet to be confirmed whether the observed shallowness in the i - v relation can be a consequence of the high density of an underlying jet .",
    "finally , @xmath55 at @xmath56 kms@xmath10 behaves dramatically different from that at lower velocities .",
    "it probably reflects a different nature of the ehv gas as discussed above .",
    "the observations reveal a jet - like and extremely high - velocity outflow originating from a high - mass protostar .",
    "the co ( 98 ) map presented here is the very first thz frequency map of a molecular outflow .",
    "it indicates that a highly - excited co line ( @xmath57 k , @xmath58 @xmath3 ) can still have broad line wings tracing parsec scale outflows .",
    "lvg calculations of the co ( 98)/(43 ) line ratios give kinetic temperatures @xmath41 k and h@xmath31 densities @xmath28",
    "the spatial - velocity structure of this relatively hot and dense outflowing gas suggests that the outflow is driven by jet bow - shocks .",
    "the detection of ir bow - shaped tips coincident with the co outflow lobes further supports this scenario .",
    "it is worth noting that the outflow shows an exceptionally shallow i - v relation in low- to high-@xmath4 co lines , though whether that shallowness is caused by a high density of the jet is to be addressed .",
    "the outflow also possesses ehv gas .",
    "the co ( 98)/(43 ) ratios and the i - v relation of the ehv emission both appear to be different from lower velocity line wings , which may suggest a different origin ( close to the central protostar ) of the ehv gas .",
    "this work is based in part on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) .",
