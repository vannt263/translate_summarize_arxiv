    "the two essential components of a virus are the genetic material and the protein _ capsid _ that surrounds the dna or rna . in 1956",
    "watson and crick noticed that because the amount of genomic material in a virus could only encode for a few capsid proteins much smaller than the overall capsid , the genetic material must instead code for a few smaller proteins that are produced in large numbers and arranged symmetrically @xcite .",
    "the 60 symmetries of the icosahedron would then imply that there should be 60 proteins forming the capsid , but this is not what has been observed in most cases . in 1962",
    "caspar and klug used the idea of quasi - equivalence to explain how more than 60 proteins could come together @xcite . with 60 proteins , each face of the icosahedron has three proteins , one near each vertex .",
    "they proposed that the faces could be further triangulated , with each smaller triangle still having three proteins .",
    "the triangulation can be seen on a triangulated sphere as in figure [ sphere].a .",
    "the original icosahedral vertices are at the centre of the red pentagons .",
    "the number of smaller triangles per original icosahedral face is known as the triangulation number @xmath0 , given by the formula @xcite @xmath3 these @xmath4 parameters signify that if one starts from one 5-fold axis , walks @xmath1 steps in one direction along the triangulated sphere s edges , takes a @xmath5 turn left and walks @xmath2 steps , then the neighbouring 5-fold vertex will be reached .",
    "the five or six proteins around a single vertex come together to form units called _ capsomers _ , which can be modelled as small spheres at the vertices produced by the triangulation .",
    "the total number of capsomers is related to the triangulation number by the formula @xcite @xmath6    .",

    "since capsomers are located on vertices of the grid , they can be described through lattice points given by coordinates in the @xmath1 and @xmath2-axes . in polar coordinates",
    ", the @xmath1-axis is oriented along @xmath9 and the @xmath2-axis is oriented along @xmath10 .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ grid ] .",

    "examples are also given of some points and their coordinates.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    in 1969 , wrigley noticed in @xcite that virus capsids tend to dissociate into certain collections of capsomers called _ symmetrons _ ; they had the shapes of regular pentagons ( _ pentasymmetrons _ ) , equilateral triangles ( _ trisymmetrons _ ) , and line segments ( _ disymmetrons _ ) .",
    "each of these symmetrons is centered on a corresponding axis of symmetry of the icosahedron ( e.g. , a pentasymmetron must be centered on an icosahedral vertex , through which a 5-fold axis of symmetry passes ) @xcite . additionally , they must be arranged in a way that conforms exactly to the symmetry of the icosahedron . due to their shapes",
    ", symmetrons can be characterized simply by their edge lengths which we shall denote by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 corresponding to di- , tri- , and pentasymmetrons respectively ( these lengths are often denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 in the literature ) .",
    "since the icosahedral vertices are always occupied by a pentasymmetron capsomer , one necessarily has @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the symmetron shapes also lead to simple formulas for the number of capsomers per symmetron : @xmath18    the number of capsomers in each symmetron depends on its edge length , and the symmetries of the icosahedron determine how many of each symmetrons there are .",
    "the above equations - can be combined with wrigley s formula relating the total number of symmetrons @xmath19 to @xmath0 to produce the equation @xmath20    in 2010 , sinkovits and baker gave a complete classification of all ways to arrange penta- and trisymmetrons to form the icosahedral capsid @xcite .",
    "however , disymmetrons were not considered , and hence as noted by wrigley , only accounted for viruses with even @xmath0 numbers @xcite .",
    "we dedicate this paper to study the geometry of icosahedral viruses which include all three types of regular symmetrons , and give a classification of possible arrangements . except for part of section [ old ] , where we recall sinkovits and baker s work @xcite ,",
    "all that follows is original work .",
    "in what follows we shall describe how icosahedral viruses can be classified by analysing the disymmetrons contained in the capsid , leading to 6 different classes of viruses . in the absence of disymmetron ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath21 , one recovers the results of @xcite , which we shall refer to as class 1 .",
    "in order to classify viruses for which @xmath22 , we shall begin by defining what _ bordering capsomers_.    a lattice point @xmath23 is * adjacent * to another lattice point , if it is connected to it by exactly one edge in the lattice .    in the lattice representation a di- , tri- , and",
    "penta - symmetron is a collection of lattice points which form a line , a triangle or pentagon . from the above definition ,",
    "the point @xmath23 is adjacent to @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .     and",
    "its 6 adjacent points.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    in a symmetron @xmath30 , a capsomer is an * interior capsomer * if all adjacent lattice points are occupied by capsomers of @xmath30 .",
    "otherwise , the capsomer is an * edge capsomer*.        set the grid so that a disymmetron @xmath31 lies along the line @xmath32 .",
    "any @xmath33 capsomer adjacent to a capsomer of @xmath31 is a * bordering capsomer * with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "bordering capsomers.,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    a symmetron is a * bordering symmetron * that * borders * the disymmetron @xmath31 if either :    * it has at least two capsomers with the same @xmath2 coordinate which are bordering capsomers with respect to @xmath31 . * or ,",
    "all of its capsomers are bordering capsomers with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath2 coordinate of the bordering capsomers determines which * side * of @xmath31 the symmetron is bordering .",
    "as can be seen from the above definitions , bordering always occurs with respect to a disymmetron , so for simplicity we shall write _ pentasymmetrons border _ when referring to _ pentasymmetrons bordering disymmetrons_. because of the convex shape of penta- and trisymmetrons , a bordering penta- or trisymmetron will have a single string of edge capsomers bordering exactly one side of the disymmetron .",
    "the symmetron shapes also dictate that if a symmetron @xmath30 has bordering capsomers with @xmath8 , then all of the capsomers of @xmath30 have @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , 2-fold symmetry about the disymmetron dictates that another symmetron @xmath35 must be bordering the disymmetron on the opposite side . from the above , on each side of the disymmetron",
    "there can be at most one bordering di- , at most one bordering tri- , and at most one bordering pentasymmetron .    by a _ symmetry of overlapping argument _ ( through which one applies icosahedral symmetry to find an overlap of symmetrons , giving a proof by contradiction ) ,",
    "a disymmetron centered on an edge @xmath36 can only be adjacent to the 4 disymmetrons centered on edges belonging to icosahedral faces with edge @xmath36 , the 2 trisymmetrons centered on icosahedral faces with edge @xmath36 , and the 2 pentasymmetrons centered on the endpoints of edge @xmath36 .",
    "note that two disymmetrons bordering each other must be parallel , but if they are centered on two edges of a single icosahedral face @xmath37 , then this is not possible if @xmath38 ( 3-fold symmetry about the center of @xmath37 dictates that they must be at @xmath5 to each other ) .",
    "therefore disymmetrons can not border each other unless @xmath39 . in appendix [ ap3 ] , we prove that bordering symmetrons must exist if disymmetrons exist , i.e. , when @xmath22 .    in",
    "what follows we shall use geometric methods to give a classification of icosahedral viruses based upon what types of symmetrons border the disymmetrons leading to six distinct classes .",
    "when only pentasymmetrons border , one has classes 2 and 5 ; when only trisymmetrons border , one has classes 3 and 6 ; when both tri- and pentasymmetrons border , one has class 4 . as stated before , when @xmath21 gives class 1",
    ". we shall now show how these classes arise and prove that they are the only possible configurations . unless stated otherwise",
    ", we shall set the coordinate grid so that , if the disymmetron exists , it occupies the lattice points from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "we shall also be applying 2- , 3- , or 6-fold symmetries , implicitly referring to the formulas given in appendix [ ap1 ] .",
    "sinkovits and baker showed that there are 3 configurations for @xmath21 , and we refer the reader to @xcite for the proof that these are all that exist .",
    "these authors considered three different configurations because several different formulas arise ( we will derive them in section [ formulas ] ) and the distinction was necessary to conform to their restriction that @xmath42 .    along this paper",
    ", we drop the restriction @xmath42 , and thus treat all 3 configurations of @xcite as the same .",
    "note that handedness can be accounted for with a reflection of the plane , or a switch between @xmath1 and @xmath2 coordinates .",
    "what these configurations have in common is that , after a reflection of the plane if needed , one can set a coordinate grid so that :    * there is a pentasymmetron @xmath43 with center at @xmath44 . *",

    "more interestingly , we can ask which solutions could be found when given @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameters . they could be multiple solutions for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and are subject to the aforementioned restrictions as well as the parity conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( or the special conditions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 for classes 5 and 6 )",
    ". thus if @xmath159 , we may have solutions from classes 1 , 2 , and 4 .",
    "if @xmath160 , we may have solutions from classes 2 , 3 , and 4 ( and possibly 5 and 6 ) .",
    "if @xmath161 or @xmath162 , we may have solutions from classes 1 , 3 , and 4 ( and possibly 6 ) .",
    "note that we can also have multiple solutions from the same class .",
    "furthermore , we can also use our knowledge of the restrictions and table [ dtphkt ] to find the exact conditions under which we will have solutions in any class .",
    "one of the most simple and useful observations is that , in most cases , there will be up to 4 solutions , except in the cases of @xmath160 , when there will generally be up to 6 solutions , and of @xmath163 , when there will be 2 solutions . as an example , table [ values ] in appendix [ ap5 ] takes some values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 and lists all possible solutions of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and the classes they belong to .",
    "the formulas and parity conditions clearly show that the classes from @xcite are not simply degenerate cases of the ones we have found . indeed , since we consider @xmath22 , the disymmetron always creates an extra line of capsomers separating the two edges of pentasymmetrons of adjacent vertices .",
    "moreover , the parity conditions are also consistent with previously known facts such as that even @xmath0 numbers are impossible without disymmetrons , as seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the solutions presented in this paper suggest the existence of certain configurations of symmetrons , and as in the case of viruses with no disymmetrons @xcite , it would be interesting to consider whether the configurations presented here physically occur in reality .",
    "moreover , since all the cases are mathematically consistent , if those viruses may not exist in nature , then further biological rules would need to be governing the behaviour of the viruses ( in the discussion presented in @xcite , examples of features apparently favoured in nature are given ) .",
    "finally , whilst the viruses studied in this paper have regular structure and symmetrons , one may consider relaxing some of the mathematical constraints imposed , in order to classify non - regular viruses .",
    "this would be necessary in order to understand , for instance , the appearance of two known viruses p23 - 77 and sh1 that have disymmetrons @xcite , and which have the same general structure , as depicted in figure [ fig : exceptionalex].a .",
    "the viruses p23 - 77 and sh1 have structure invariants @xmath89 , so the expected solutions would be class 2 with edge lengths @xmath164 given by @xmath165 ; class 2 with @xmath166 ; class 3 with @xmath167 ( shown in figure [ fig : exceptionalex].b ) ; class 4 with @xmath168 ; or class 4 with @xmath169 .",
