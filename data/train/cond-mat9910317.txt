    "the theory of doped mott insulator systems have shown variety of electronic ground states from electronic liquid crystal phases @xcite to the usual metallic state that depend on doping level .",
    "the complex character of phase diagram is caused by the long - range coulomb interaction between electrons placed in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "besides , the well defined layered structure is a common feature of these systems at all variety of other properties .",
    "both these features are essential difficulties that obstacle to construct correct theory here up to the moment .    therefore , the majority of the works in the field are the studies of the _ two_-dimensional systems with quite complicated interactions .",
    "the separation of the charge and spin variables is an additional simplification here @xcite .",
    "sometimes such models are not quite realistic and can not be applied to describe the systems without magnetic ions .",
    "for example , some systems without magnetic ions , like ba@xmath0k@xmath1bio@xmath2 , have shown a remnant of charge ordering above t@xmath3 -temperature of superconductive phase transition for the optimally doping value of x=0.4 .    in present article",
    "we show that the density stratification ( or phase separation ) accompanied by a collection of classic phases ( like wigner crystal or stripe - ordering ) appears already in a very simple model of three dimensional layered crystal with long - range coulomb interaction among spinless charges .",
    "one deals here with a case that is extremely difficult for the theory . from one side",
    "the well pronounced anisotropy and layered structure do not give a chance to limit ourselves by simple mean - field approximation which is suitable for analytic theory . from another one ,",
    "the essentially many - body and 3d character of the system makes it difficult to simulate its behavior directly .",
    "however , the development of the computer technology continuously lowers the extent of the simplification that is necessary for numerical simulation . as a rule",
    ", the simulation in two or three dimensions is performed separately . keeping in mind an application to above layered structures ,",
    "it is interesting to simulate just intermediate case .",
    "let us suppose that the equally charged spinless particles move and interact in 3d space with a positive background that includes a periodic potential along one of the dimensions which we choose as @xmath4-direction .",
    "first of all , let us discuss briefly qualitative effect of  layer structure  . at some conditions the particles",
    "should be found as localized completely in a vicinity of the equidistant layers .",
    "it generates a strong impact from the 2d behavior into collective behavior .",
    "the particles tend to produce a hexagonal ( wigner ) crystal in each layer .",
    "the particles from neighboring layers interact with collective potential of this crystal and tend to dispose in its minima . in an ideal ( translational invariant ) case the particles have to be found under centers of the neighboring layer exactly .",
    "the particles from a next layer should be found just under positions of the particles from the first one .",
    "however , these particles repulse too .",
    "so , the energy minimum , should be a nontrivial compromise between long - range interaction of the particles and the energy of bonding inside the layers .",
    "numerical simulation shows that the symmetric position of the particles over the centers of the cells of the wigner crystal is unstable .",
    "they are shifted ( in a projection onto layer plane ) in a direction of one of the neighboring particles . in particular",
    ", it breaks the geometric frustration in the collective position of a hexagonal 2d lattice from one layer under another .",
    "it looks like as follows . moving in a collective field of the neighboring layers the carriers attract to the minima of the potential .",
    "these minima play a role of effective  positively charged particles  .",
    "the projections of real particles from the neighboring layers ( attracted to these minima ) on the @xmath5-plane can be treated as  images  of these effective particles .",
    "this is essentially 3d picture , but in some sense it is quite close to a stripe formation in cuprates and nikelates @xcite .",
    "it is direct analogy to previously studied process of screening in a system containing two kinds of the particles that bind into  pairs  .",
    "these pairs are dipolarly charged and form , in their turn , the chains of the dipoles @xcite .",
    "let us note once more that the  pairs ",
    "mentioned above are formed by particles from different layers .",
    "so , this pairing is essentially 3d phenomenon .",
    "moreover , we found that the variation of the density leads to other nontrivial structures also .",
    "in particular , at low density the system produces an unusual  droplet phase  .",
    "this phase consists of the charged droplets with an internal structure .",
    "one can believe that the specific dipolar chain structure or structuralised droplet phase can attitude to actively studied now mechanism of superconductivity of novel superconductors .",
    "to restore the structures appearing in the system of moving charges placed into 3d compensating background with periodically modulated potential along one of the dimensions we apply the brownian dynamics ( bd ) technique .",
    "this technique is widely applied last years @xcite  ( in particular , by the authors of present article @xcite ) to simulate a behavior of different systems .",
    "it is useful in the cases when the discrete description in terms of the moving particles is more natural than the continuous kinetic approach .",
    "the technique is based on the solution of the system of the dynamic equations for the particles with discrete set of the coordinates @xmath6 where @xmath7.and the vectors @xmath8 connecting different particles .",
    "the choice of appropriate boundary conditions depends on the specific problem .",
    "mutual relation between this and kinetic approaches is obtained due to following two features of the description .",
    "first of all , the equations in such an approach contain some random noise sources @xcite .",
    "together with a relaxation terms in the equations this reproduces an effect of final ( nonzero ) temperature ( in according to known fluctuation - dissipative theorem ) . besides",
    ", if it is necessary , the continual densities of all values of the problem are restored ",
    "@xmath9  by means of a summation over realizations and averaging during sufficiently long time .",
    "this time is also determined from the numerical simulation for a specific problem @xcite .    in particular the density of particle distribution in real space @xmath10is restored by a summation @xmath11over particle coordinates and averaging @xmath12  over characteristic time @xmath13 .",
    "this density is taken to calculate the correlation functions of the problem ( for example : two - point correlation function @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes an averaging over ensemble of particles ) .",
    "the set of the correlation functions gives complete information about the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "more detail description of the approach , as well as some examples of its utilization , can be found in previous publications by different authors @xcite . in present work ,",
    "we limit ourselves by relatively short positing of the problem and discussion of numerical results .",
    "the set of bd equations can be written in a form    @xmath16 here @xmath17  is relaxation constant . to model a thermal bath",
    "we apply the gaussian random force @xmath18 , @xmath19    periodic one - particle potential is chosen in following form    @xmath20    the system is supposed to be continued periodically . here",
    "@xmath21 is a period of the potential along the @xmath4-axis and @xmath22 is an integer number .",
    "along two other axes the system is quasi - infinite .",
    "the boundary conditions along all the axes are as follows .",
    "every particle interacts with the particles inside the calculation volume @xmath23 as well as with all their  images  obtained as a result of the translation of particle coordinates across ( beyond ) nearest boundary @xcite .",
    "so , the many - body potential @xmath24 in the equations contains the vectors @xmath25 with all possible permutations . the sign  +  or  -",
    " is determined by a direction to the nearest boundary plane along given axis . besides , if moving particle leaves the volume @xmath23 along one of the axes it is returned to the volume . at absence of external field",
    "it can by done or by means of mirror reflection , or by cyclic shift . in the second case corresponding projection of the velocity conserves and the coordinate projection",
    "is shifted as follows : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this approach is quite suitable for the simulation of translation invariant system of charges in solid state . used here many body potential @xmath28contains from long - range coulomb interaction @xmath29 and cut - off screening impact  @xmath30 from crystal lattice and other subsystems of the problem .",
    "numerical results are summarized in the figs .",
    "[ snap0]-[phase ] .",
    "for definiteness all instant configurations of the particles here were obtained in the frames of uniform kinetic scenario .",
    "the random distributions of the charges over system have been taken as the initial conditions . from physical point of view appearance of such carriers in the system",
    "can be treated as a result of a doping . in its turn",
    ", it corresponds to standard initial conditions for a search of an energy minimum by relaxation technique @xcite and annealing technique @xcite .",
    "besides , equal number of the particles @xmath31=256 has been used for all the cases .",
    "a number of the variables of 3d problem ( the coordinates and velocities ) corresponding to this number of particles is equal to @xmath32 . in its turn",
    ", it corresponds to approximately @xmath33 of their mutual combinations that should be calculated at every step .",
    "at given number of the particles @xmath31=256 the charge density is varied by change of the cross - section @xmath34  of the calculation volume @xmath35(at periodic boundary conditions described above ) .",
    "to control the results were reproduced at some densities for other numbers of particles ( @xmath36 and @xmath37  , with respectively chosen cross - section of the box @xmath38 ) .",
    "at initial stage of the evolution the particles spontaneously group to the vicinities of the planes corresponding to the minima of periodic potential @xmath39 .",
    "these minima below are named as the  layers  . for definiteness",
    ", we are denote the particles as belonging to a given layer in the case if the @xmath4-coordinate is away from the layer not more than 0.1 of distance between the layers @xmath40 .",
    "typical projection on @xmath5-plane of an instant configuration of two arbitrary neighboring layers at early evolution stage is shown in the fig.[snap0 ] .",
    "the particles from different layers are shown by two kinds of the circles ( black and white respectively ) .",
    "all other particles are not shown in this figure . typical for this stage tendency to a  pairing  ( in projection onto @xmath5-plane ) of the particles from neighboring layers is seen directly .    below this tendency",
    "will be characterized numerically .",
    "let us note that such a state conserves for some of intermediate densities only .",
    "in particular , the configuration shown in fig . [ snap0 ]",
    "is interesting because it takes place in system with relatively high density ( @xmath41 at @xmath42 ) at initial kinetic stage .",
    "another , tetragonal , structure is found to be natural for this system in a final equilibrium state .",
    "instant particle configurations at final ( but not equilibrium ) stages of structure forming is shown in fig .",
    "[ snap1 ] for three specific densities . as before",
    ", the only particle coordinates for two consistent layers are shown by means of different circles in projection onto @xmath5-plane .",
    "the case ( a ) corresponds to already mentioned high density ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the configuration ( b ) conserves at long time for the density close to some critical one ( @xmath43 ) . and at small density ( @xmath44 ) a kind of clasterisation into  droplets",
    " happens in the system .",
    "these droplets contain of scraps of charge chains and , therefore , possess some kind of fine structure .",
    "the droplets from different layers repulse mutually .",
    "the state obtained looks like analogous distributions obtained at concentration stratification ( or phase separation ) of the particles of different kind @xcite .",
    "for briefness it could be called as  phase separation  too .",
    "one can use a time dependence of minimal distance between particles @xmath45  as a numerical characteristics of different scenarios at different densities @xmath46 .",
    "this value corresponds to mean distance between nearest neighbors .",
    "different mutual relations and sign of inequality between values of @xmath47 inside the layers and for the pairs of neighboring layers reflects a difference between visually observed structures .",
    "four qualitatively different scenarios of evolution of the distance between nearest particles are shown in fig.[time ] .",
    "it is done for following cases : ( a ) at high density ( @xmath41 ) ; ( b ) at some density close , but slightly higher than a critical one ( @xmath48 ) ; ( c ) ( b ) at a density close , but lower than a critical one ( @xmath49 ) ; and finally ( d ) at very low density ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the averaged projections of the distances inside the layers and between them are shown by black and white circles respectively .    at fixed distance between the layers",
    "the average interaction between the layers is proportional to the density .",
    "when the density is high enough this interaction is quite strong to order particles in 3d structure .",
    "the fig.[tetra ]  presents typical tetragonal crystal structure that is obtained at high density .",
    "the particular case of ( @xmath41 ) is shown in isometric projection .",
    "long - wave @xmath4-displacements of the particles inside each of layer are directly visible .",
    "it is caused by strong interaction along @xmath4-axis which does not allow to create an ideal 3d tetragonal lattice .",
    "when the density goes to some critical one ( @xmath51 ) the force bonding the particles in the layers prevail the @xmath4-component of the interaction between layers .",
    "the particles are locked strongly in the layers and ordered hexagonally . naturally , the mean distance between nearest neighbors stabilizes with a time .",
    "however , the distance between the projections of particles from different layers does not tend to zero now ( as it takes place for 3d tetragonal lattice ) .",
    "this fact is reflected by difference in behavior of the lower lines in the figs.[time](a - c ) .",
    "finally , when the density is extremely low the repulsion between the particles from different layers is notable for sufficiently big groups of the particles .",
    "phase separation occurs now .",
    "the particles combine into clusters ( or droplets ) .",
    "the projections of the clusters from different layers mutually fill in free spaces for each other . a tendency to form stripes or chains of charge along one of spontaneously chosen direction",
    "is observed in the system .",
    "all these modifications of the structure are reflected by physically measurable correlation function @xmath52 shown in the fig.[corr](a - c ) .",
    "the value @xmath53 is calculated here for one representative layer and shown for following three typical cases : ( a ) well pronounced tetragonal lattice ( at @xmath54 ) ; ( b ) for hexagonal ordering of the particles inside the layers ( @xmath48 ) ; ( c ) for droplets phase appearing at phase separation into charge rich and charge poor domains ( at small density @xmath44 ) .",
    "the well defined filament structure caused by the scraps of charge chains are visible . in all pictures the averaged minimal distance between particles inside the layer for the given @xmath55 are marked by the arrows .",
    "a dependence of equilibrium averaged minimal distance between the particles @xmath56  from density ( shown as a function from box size @xmath57at fixed number of particles @xmath42 ) is summarized in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "as before , two kinds of the circles denotes the values of @xmath58 corresponding to the particles from the same or different layers .",
    "sloping dash - doted line gives a slope of the @xmath59 function for ideal tetragonal lattice .",
    "this plot can be treated as a phase diagram of the system .",
    "this diagram is done in terms of the mean density @xmath60at fixed @xmath61 .    vertical dashed line ( at @xmath62 )",
    "denotes a transition between two different structures .",
    "it can be proven that for this case the relation between two distances ( on upper and lower curves ) is equal exactly to the @xmath63 .",
    "this relation corresponds to ideal 3d hexagonal ordering .",
    "dotted vertical line corresponds to a transition from a charge order like wigner crystals to the phase separation structure which contains charge - rich droplets with an internal fine structure .",
    "it should be noted that the curves @xmath59 do not reach horizontal asymptotes .",
    "it means that the internal density of the charges in the droplets depends on the value of averaged density in the whole system . in spite of some analogy with a picture of liquid droplets",
    "this fact is caused by absent of direct attraction among particles .",
    "the particles can not collect together in compact droplets .",
    "the only effective attraction exists here which is caused by a pairing of those particles from different layers which are close to the droplet boundaries . as a result ,",
    "the size of the droplets is always comparable with a distance between them . from physical point of view",
    "the dependence of the internal density of charge in the droplets from the doping level is one of the mostly important feature of this new droplet phase .",
