    "although the concept of a black hole is well - established and generally accepted in the relativity , astrophysics , and particle physics communities , one sometimes encounters a certain amount of scepticism regarding the physical reality of the mathematical solution , and wariness regarding the interpretation of observational data  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the schwarzschild solution comes at the expense of a central singularity , and an event horizon at the schwarzschild radius @xmath0 .",
    "critics of black holes , at least the rational ones , seek an alternative configuration of matter that concentrates as much energy density as possible within a radius of @xmath1 while avoiding the formation of the singularity and the event horizon .",
    "one of the small number of serious challenges to the usual concept of black holes is the `` gravastar '' ( _ _ gra__vitational _ _ va__cuum _ star _ ) model that was recently developed by mazur and mottola  @xcite . in the gravastar picture , or the very closely related quantum phase transition picture developed by laughlin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the quantum vacuum undergoes a phase transition at or near @xmath2 where the event horizon would have been expected to form .",
    "somewhat related models , differing in motivation and technical details , can be traced back to gliner  @xcite and dymnikova  @xcite .    in the mazur  mottola model , a suitable segment of de sitter space ( with an equation of state @xmath3 ) is chosen for the interior of the compact object while the outer region of the gravastar consists of a ( relatively thin ) finite - thickness shell of stiff matter ( @xmath4 ) that is in turn surrounded by schwarzschild vacuum ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "apart from these three explicitly mentioned layers , the mazur  mottola model requires two additional infinitesimally - thin shells with surface densities @xmath6 , and surface tensions @xmath7 , that compensate the discontinuities in the pressure profile and stabilize this 5-layer onion - like construction , effectively by introducing delta - function anisotropic pressures @xcite . since infinitesimally thin shells are a mathematical abstraction , for physical reasons it is useful to minimize the use of thin shells , either by successfully reducing the system to a 3-layer onion with _",
    "one _ thin shell surrounded by segments of schwarzschild and de sitter space  @xcite , or more boldly ( as in this article ) by attempting to replace the thin shells completely with a continuous layer of finite thickness .    indeed ,",
    "in the present article we demonstrate that the pressure anisotropy implicit in the mazur ",
    "mottola infinitesimally thin shell is not an accident , but instead a _ necessity _ for all gravastar - like objects .",
    "that is , attempting to build a gravastar completely out of perfect fluid will always fail .",
    "( either the gravastar swells up to infinite size , or a horizon will form despite one s best efforts , or worse a naked singularity will manifest itself . )",
    "we derive this result by working with configurations where pressure is assumed continuous and differentiable , and analyzing the resulting static geometry using first the _ isotropic _ tov equation , and then the _ anisotropic _ tov equation .",

    ", we discontinue indicating the explicit @xmath11-dependence of all relevant functions .",
    "the remaining field equation for the transverse pressure is quite messy .",
    "instead , we make use of the bianchi identities and replace it with the covariant conservation of stress energy : @xmath18 in the case of isotropic pressures @xmath19 this leads to the standard tov equation , which can be written in any of the equivalent forms @xmath20 }   = -\\frac{4\\pi\\,r}{3}\\ , \\frac{(\\rho+p)\\;(\\rhoavg+3p)}{1 - 2m(r)/r}.\\ ] ] for anisotropic pressures we find it convenient to define the dimensionless anisotropy parameter @xmath21 so that in terms of this parameter the anisotropic tov becomes @xmath22 before going on to explore some of the key features and consequences of equations and , we must define the class of spacetime geometries that we are particularly interested in .",
    "to have a useful model , we should retain as much of standard physics as possible , while introducing a minimum of `` new physics '' . in the spirit of mazur and mottola  @xcite , and laughlin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we will keep the density positive throughout the configuration but permit the pressure to become negative in the gravastar interior . to avoid infinitesimally thin shells one must then demand that the radial pressure @xmath23 is continuous ( though the density need not be continuous , and typically is not continuous at the surface of the gravastar ) . qualitatively the radial pressure is taken to be that of figure [ f : pressure ] .",
    "that is , to `` smooth out '' the infinitesimally thin shells of the mazur ",

    "these three features , positive density , negative central pressure , and the absence of horizons , are the three most important features characterizing a gravastar .",
    "other important features are :    * to keep the centre of the spacetime regular , we enforce both @xmath30 and @xmath31 . * there should be a pressure maximum in the general vicinity of the schwarzschild radius , @xmath32 , satisfying @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "+ ( this permits the physics in the region @xmath35 to be more or less standard . )",
    "* there should be exactly two radii where the radial pressure vanishes : * * the first pressure zero @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , and * * the second pressure zero @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "+ the point @xmath40 , ( which by construction must satisfy @xmath41 ) , is called the surface of the gravastar . * the pressure profile @xmath42 should be continuous .",
    "+ ( in contrast , it is sometimes useful to allow @xmath43 to be discontinuous . ) * the strong energy condition [ sec ; @xmath44 is definitely violated , at least near the centre of the gravastar .",
    "* we choose to enforce the null energy condition [ nec ; @xmath45 throughout the gravastar . in view of our first comment",
    "that density is everywhere positive , this implies that we are enforcing the weak energy condition [ wec ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "* we impose no restriction regarding the dominant energy condition [ dec ; @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and in fact we shall see that the dec must fail in parts of the gravastar that are sufficiently `` close '' to forming a horizon .",

    "the 3-layer variant considered in  @xcite is effectively the mazur ",

    "there is implicitly a singular infinitesimally thin shell located exactly at @xmath2 with infinite surface tension .",
    "the gliner  @xcite and dymnikova  @xcite proposals all satisfy the constraint @xmath59 everywhere throughout the configuration . for the purposes of this article",
    "we view this as an unnecessary specialization .",
    "one might wonder why we do not place the gravastar surface at @xmath60 ?",
    "after all the pressure is by definition zero there so we can smoothly join it on to an exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "the reason for not doing so is a purely pragmatic one based on the fate of infalling positive - pressure matter .",
    "if we start without a positive - pressure region of type @xmath61 , then any infalling positive - pressure matter that accumulates above @xmath60 will automatically generate a positive - pressure region of type @xmath61 .",
    "the only way to avoid a positive - pressure region of type @xmath61 is if the negative - pressure matter in the @xmath62 region immediately catalyzes any infalling positive - pressure matter into negative - pressure matter .",
    "this scenario has its own risks , and for now we will keep the negative - pressure matter deep in the core , discretely hidden behind a layer of positive - pressure matter .",
    "( this is exactly what mazur and mottola did with their layer of stiff matter . )",
    "for the time being , we are only considering perfect fluids , so that the pressure is isotropic : @xmath63 and @xmath64 throughout this section .",
    "consider first the isotropic tov equation at @xmath65 where the pressure is first zero .",
    "we find that @xmath66 but the lhs is by assumption positive , while the rhs is by assumption negative .",
    "therefore the isotropic tov _ can not _ hold at the point @xmath60 .",
    "secondly , consider the point of maximal positive pressure , @xmath67 .",
    "it follows from the isotropic tov equation ( [ eq : tov ] ) that @xmath68 but @xmath69 everywhere inside the gravastar , and by assumption @xmath70 in the class of models we consider .",
    "so the lhs is zero while the rhs is negative .",
    "therefore the isotropic tov _ can not _ hold at the point @xmath55 .",
    "in fact the objects under investigation have an increasing ( radial ) pressure for the entire range @xmath71 while the ( radial ) pressure in the same interval is positive .",
    "that is the lhs of the isotropic tov is positive in this region , while the rhs of the isotropic tov is negative .",
    "hence , it follows by contradiction from ( [ eq : tov ] ) that isotropic pressure in that interval is not able to satisfy the tov equation , and thus a static spacetime geometry can only be obtained with anisotropic pressures .",
    "the same argument holds for a larger interval that extends below @xmath60 and into the negative pressure region : assuming the nec , we have @xmath72 . therefore , by equation , we must have @xmath73 if the pressure gradient for isotropic pressures is to be positive . now at the centre of the gravastar @xmath74 , while at @xmath60 we have @xmath75",
    ". therefore @xmath76 changes sign somewhere in the interval @xmath77 .",
    "define @xmath78 to be the location where @xmath76 changes sign .",
    "we conclude that pressure isotropy fails for the entire region where both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and quite possibly fails for an even larger region .",
    "that is , isotropy definitely fails on the region @xmath81 , a region which definitely encompasses @xmath82 .",
    "let us call the region @xmath83 the `` core '' where the physics is qualitatively ( if not necessarily quantitatively ) similar to that of de sitter space .",
    "in particular in the `` core '' the local acceleration due to gravity [ given by equation ] is outward . similarly let us call @xmath84 the `` crust '' , where physics is still definitely `` unusual '' .",
    "in the `` crust '' the local acceleration due to gravity is inward , but the pressure still rises as one moves outward . finally , call @xmath85 the `` atmosphere '' , where the physics is `` normal '' , or rather as normal as it is going to get in a gravastar . in the `` atmosphere '' the local acceleration due to gravity is inwards , and the pressure decreases as one moves outwards .",
    "( see figure [ f : crust ] . ) with these definitions , we see that pressure is guaranteed to be anisotropic throughout the `` crust '' .",
    "note that even if we were to dispense with the entire positive - pressure region by chopping the gravastar off at @xmath60 , there is still an anisotropic crust in the region @xmath86 $ ] .    to conclude this section",
    ", we summarize that a static spherically symmetric object with positive density , negative central pressure and vanishing pressure at the surface can not be supported by isotropic pressures alone  there are no perfect fluid gravastars .",
    "a particular illustration of what goes wrong when one tries to build a perfect fluid gravastar is provided by the schwarzschild interior solution . in this model",
    "one assumes constant positive density @xmath87 throughout the whole star and invokes the isotropic tov equation . despite common misconception , this does _ not _ mean the star is incompressible or that the speed of sound goes to infinity . see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ff ) and @xcite . in this situation",
    "one has the well - known analytical solution  @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath40 are the total mass and surface radius and @xmath90 .",
    "the central pressure @xmath91 certainly diverges for @xmath92 and is positive for all @xmath93 .",
    "this is a first indication of the existence of the buchdahl  bondi bound , but by itself is not enough to derive this bound for arbitrary perfect fluid spheres @xcite .",
    "since we are only interested in this model as an example , we need not worry about fully general statements and simply note that @xmath94 while this is a perfectly sensible solution in the mathematical sense one would generally rule it out physically because of the negative central pressure .",
    "if we leave our prejudice against negative pressures aside , adopting the gravastar philosophy , we find that with the choice of , the pressure profile will have a first order pole at @xmath95 note that as @xmath96 goes from 8/9 to 1 , the position of this pole moves from the centre of the star to the surface of the star .",
    "the situation is qualitatively sketched in figure [ f : pole ] .",
    "note that the nec must be violated sufficiently close to the pole .",
    "this is now clearly unphysical , even if one is willing to accept negative pressures and even violations of the nec .",
    "it is unphysical for more prosaic reasons because the pressure pole implies a curvature singularity  in fact the @xmath97 and @xmath98 orthonormal components of the riemann tensor are infinite , so that one has a naked singularity .",
    "the reason why we mention this specific example is because we shall soon see this `` pressure pole '' behaviour is generic  continuous solutions with isotropic pressure are not possible as we have already shown in section [ sec : iso_fail ] .",
    "is considered .",
    "the surface of their configuration occurs at @xmath99 where @xmath100 , at least as one approaches the surface from below .",
    "so the surface of their configuration is a naked singularity , in agreement with the observations above . ]",
    "consider now an arbitrary gravastar ( of the type defined above ) .",

    "this is more unusual than one might expect from the simplicity of the argument .",
    "while the compactness of a normal perfect fluid star tends to increase as one moves outwards , in a normal star it also can be subject to oscillations that make the overall picture quite subtle  @xcite .",
    "consider now a perfect fluid sphere with negative central pressure that satisfies the nec .",
    "since we have already seen that isotropy is violated on @xmath105 , the only way we can maintain the perfect fluid nature of the sphere is if @xmath106 .",
    "( whence also @xmath107 . )",
    "but since we do not want a horizon to form , the compactness must be bounded above by unity . and",
    "since we have just shown the compactness is monotonic we now see @xmath108.\\ ] ] so not only does a nec - satisfying perfect - fluid gravastar expand to infinite volume , it also has infinite mass .    to avoid the physical size of the gravastar blowing up to @xmath107 , our options now are rather limited",
    ": we could permit the development of a horizon at finite @xmath11 , which defeats the whole point of the exercise , or we could permit something even worse .",
    "if we permit nec violations then it is possible to arrange for the development of a pressure pole at finite @xmath51 . to see how this is possible ,",

    "( it is easy to check that higher - order poles do not even have this nice property of being compatible with the isotropic tov equation . ) now despite the fact that the presence of a simple pole in the pressure is compatible with the isotropic tov equation , we must reiterate that such a pressure pole is unphysical because it is a naked singularity  the physically correct deduction form this analysis is that gravastar - like objects must violate pressure isotropy .",
    "once we accept that perfect fluid spheres are not what we are looking for to model gravastars , one might wonder what happens to the buchdahl  bondi bound for isotropic fluid spheres .",

    "mottola model is _ not _ a physical necessity , but is merely a convenient way to avoid an infinitely diffuse atmosphere that would arise otherwise from the equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "a finite surface radius @xmath40 can be modelled by altering the equation of state slightly to include a finite surface density @xmath157 which is reached for vanishing pressure : @xmath158 .",

    "in the case of a perfect fluid , the geometry is completely defined by the set of differential equations , plus initial conditions and an equation of state , which is commonly written as @xmath159 or equivalently @xmath160 .",
    "once we accept the need to abandon the notion of a perfect fluid , we have to replace the isotropic tov equation with its anisotropic counterpart and thereby introduce an additional ( free ) function @xmath161 . to close the set of equations , it is now necessary to define _ two _ equations of state .",
    "naively , one might choose @xmath162 and @xmath163 , which is a rather strong assumption that forces @xmath23 and @xmath164 to change in lock - step .",
    "alternatively , one could simply postulate a density profile @xmath165 ( which is the strategy adopted , for example , in @xcite ) or equivalently a pressure profile , plus one equation of state .",
    "one could also ( rather unphysically ) choose to specify any two profiles @xmath165 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 by hand , and use the anisotropic tov to calculate the remaining profile .",
    "yet another possibility to obtain a well defined solution lies in finding an additional ( differential ) equation , that might be motivated by some appropriate variational principle , for example by minimizing the `` total anisotropy '' @xmath166 = 0\\ , .\\ ] ] no matter whether it is an equation of state for the transverse pressure or a variational principle for the total anisotropy , the extra equation should ( if the gravastar model is to be even qualitatively correct ) be responsible for maintaining stability of the gravastar over a wide range of total masses and central pressures .",
    "in other words , the closed set of equations must be self - regulating if it is to be physically interesting  the gravastar should shift to a new stable configuration when the total mass changes .",
    "the central point of this article is that if you wish to believe in gravastars you must accept that there will be regions of anisotropic pressure where @xmath167 .",
    "this suggests that it might be most efficient to choose the two distinct `` equations of state '' as being equations for @xmath113 and for @xmath126 .",
    "but what variables should these equations of state depend on ?",
    "an obvious candidate is the radial pressure , but in view of the inequality it is clear that the gravastar material , if it is to succeed in generically avoiding the formation of horizons should be sensitive to the `` compactness '' @xmath104 .",
    "that is , we should posit equations of state of the form @xmath168 and ( making everything as explicit as possible ) solve the paired differential equations @xmath169\\;[2m(r)/r+8\\pi \\;p_r(r ) \\;r^2 ] } { 2\\,r\\;[1 - 2m(r)/r ] }   \\nonumber \\\\   & & + { 2\\;\\rho(r , p_r(r),2m(r)/r)\\;\\delta(r , p_r(r),2m(r)/r)\\over r};\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath170 whether or not the gravastar model ultimately succeeds in its goals depends on whether or not one can find physically realistic equations of state that have the effect of bounding @xmath123 for large ranges of @xmath171 and total mass .",
    "now there is an important issue of principle here : traditional relativists are somewhat nervous when the variable @xmath172 enters the equation of state , arguing that @xmath172 is not detectable by local physics , and that an equation of state that depends on @xmath172 somehow violates the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "this is not correct for the following reason : @xmath172 is certainly measurable by _ quasi - local effects _ in small but _ finite size regions_. to see this note that for any static spherically symmetric spacetime the orthonormal components of the riemann tensor are ( see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p 110 ) ) : @xmath173;\\ ] ] @xmath174;\\ ] ] @xmath175;\\ ] ] @xmath176.\\ ] ] the point here is that the riemann tensor is certainly measurable in finite - sized regions , so in particular @xmath177 is measurable .",
    "likewise @xmath11 is measurable in finite - sized regions , and therefore @xmath178 is measurable .",
    "consequently the compactness @xmath172 is a quasi - local measurable quantity and it can meaningfully be put into the equation of state without violating the equivalence principle .",
    "( in either the mazur  mottola scenario  @xcite or the laughlin _ et al .",
    "_ scenario  @xcite the gravastar material is assumed to be a quantum condensate , and therefore sensitive to non - local physics .",
    "the point of the current discussion is that we do not need to appeal to quantum non - locality to get @xmath172 into the equation of state  properly understanding the equivalence principle is enough . )",
    "note that while this argument demonstrates that possible equations of state are at least conceivable , that is not the same as explicitly demonstrating that such equations of state actually exist .",
    "that is a challenge which we leave for the future .",
    "in this article we have delineated the qualitative features one would expect from a gravastar configuration that avoids delta function transition layers and has finite regular pressure profile at all locations .",
    "we have used these qualitative features to place constraints on the anisotropy parameter @xmath126 , demonstrating that perfect fluid gravastars are a lost cause , and extracting some generic information regarding what the gravastar equation of state should be .    specifically , finite - sized gravastar - like objects ( with the key defining feature being negative central pressure ) must exhibit anisotropic stresses in their `` crust '' , which is the region where the pressure is increasing as one moves outwards but the local force of gravity is inwards . trying to build a perfect fluid gravastar results either in an infinite - size infinite - mass object , or in a naked singularity as the pressure exhibits a simple pole . assuming the wec , the magnitude of anisotropy required in the crust can be explicitly bounded in terms of the local compactness @xmath104 , and becomes arbitrarily large for gravastars that are sufficiently close to forming a horizon , in which case the dec must be violated .",
    "consequently , if one demands that the equation of state for gravastar matter results in configurations that are horizon - avoiding for large ranges of total mass and central pressure , then it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the equation of state must depend on the local compactness @xmath104 .",
    "this is certainly an unusual equation of state , but we emphasise that ( when properly understood ) this does not violate the equivalence principle .    while we are personally agnostic as to the existence or non - existence of gravastars , we feel it is important to understand what their general properties might be in order to have a clear understanding of what the observational evidence regarding astrophysical black holes is actually telling us .",

    "<S> one of the very small number of serious alternatives to the usual concept of an astrophysical black hole is the `` gravastar '' model developed by mazur and mottola ; and a related phase - transition model due to laughlin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. we consider a generalized class of similar models that exhibit continuous pressure  without the presence of infinitesimally thin shells . by considering the usual tov equation for static solutions with negative central pressure , we find that gravastars can not be perfect fluids  anisotropic pressures in the `` crust '' of a gravastar - like object are unavoidable . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic tov equation can then be used to bound the pressure anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse stresses that support a gravastar permit a higher compactness than is given by the buchdahl  bondi bound for perfect fluid stars . </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment on the qualitative features of the equation of state that gravastar material must have if it is to do the desired job of preventing horizon formation .    </S>",
