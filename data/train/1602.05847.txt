    "homochirality of nucleic acids and proteins is one of the attributes that characterize life on the earth@xcite . at present time",
    "all the living organisms in our planet have nucleic acids ( dna , rna , etc . ) with nucleotide bases that just take , between their two possible chiral forms , the one usually labelled as _",
    "( for dextro or right - handed ) ; also , their proteins are chains of amino acids all of which are enantiomers of ( exclusively ) the class l ( for levo , or left - handed ) except by the amino acid glycine that is not a chiral molecule . to understand why the combination _",
    "d _ for nucleotide bases and l for amino acids ( and not any other ) occurs in living systems is one of the greatest quests of biology .",
    "the attempts to answer this question involves either biotic or abiotic arguments . in general the hypotheses of the first type assume that homochirality is determined by biological necessity and that it is the result of diverse selection mechanisms . among the abiotic hypotheses we have those that propose a `` frozen accident '' as the responsible of the homogeneous chirality and those that assume the existence of some asymmetric force that selects just one of the chiral forms@xcite .",
    "the problem with these theories is that , in general , they can not be experimentally checked .",
    "this difficulty is ( at least partially ) overcome by some hypotheses that claim that homochirality and the universal genetic code arose closely related .",
    "more precisely , that the genetic code , its translation direction  and homochirality emerged through a common natural process of selection@xcite .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it can incorporate the idea of an ancestral direct affinity between amino acids and nucleotide triplets which , these last , further acquire new functions , within a more modern translation machinery , in the form of codons and anticodons .",
    "the goal is that this early affinity between triplets of nucleotide bases and amino acids can at present be studied in standard laboratories by simply synthesizing small rna - oligonucleotides@xcite .",
    "this way preference of l - amino acids by _ d_-bases triplets has been demonstrated@xcite .",
    "moreover , the non - biological affinity of d - amino acids by _ l_-codons is also observed@xcite .",
    "besides , the hypothesis of coevolution of homochirality with the genetic code , makes a number of additional predictions such as the possibility that each codon can encode at least two different amino acids ( according with the reading direction : @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) so the eventual existence of more than a single code becomes possible@xcite .",
    "we must mention , however , that , despite the possibility of existence of ancestral _",
    "l_-ribonucleic sites for d - amino acids , there is also experimental evidence of the impossibility of incorporating d - amino acids in protein structures in present biosynthetic pathways .",
    "specifically it has been reported chiral discrimination during the aminoacylation in the active site of the aminoacyl trna synthetase and also during the peptide bond formation  in the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center@xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to show how a mathematical representation of the genetic code recently reported by us@xcite can naturally incorporate chirality in such a way that the resulting description be consistent with many of the previous observations .",
    "our original representation is guided by a diagram that we have proposed to sketch the evolution of the genetic code ( see figure 2 in next section ) .",
    "the diagram is based on pioneering ideas by crick@xcite and includes the physical concept of broken symmetry@xcite in a very simple form that resembles the energy levels of an atom .",
    "the representation uses hamilton quaternions@xcite as main tool .",
    "these mathematical objects are a sort of generalization of the complex numbers and obey an algebra in many aspects similar to theirs but with the very important ( for our purposes ) property that the product is , in general , non commutative .",
    "in addition , the quaternions are ideal for representing spatial rotations@xcite with important advantages over the classical matrix representation .    in our quaternionic representation",
    "we assign to each amino acid in a given protein two quaternions : an integer one according to which one of the 20 standard amino acids it is ( type quaternion ) and a real one that determines its order inside the protein primary structure ( order quaternion ) .",
    "the type quaternions are obtained as a quaternionic function of the codons where each of the three nucleotides bases is associate to an integer quaternion .",
    "the form of this function being inspired by the code evolution diagram .",
    "the order quaternions , on the other hand , play a fundamental role in relation with the folding of the protein@xcite .",
    "the integer quaternions that we choose to associate with the nucleotides bases belong to a maximum cardinality subset of the set @xmath4 with the property that it does not contain pairs of conjugate quaternions .",
    "the set @xmath5 has @xmath6 elements@xcite and so the chosen subset has @xmath7 quaternions as it should be .",
    "this suggest to partition the set @xmath5 in the form @xmath8 ( where the four quaternions of @xmath9and the four quaternions of @xmath10 are mutually conjugates ) and to associate the elements of @xmath9and @xmath10 with the four d - nucleotide bases and the four l - nucleotide bases of d - rna and l - rna molecules , respectively . this way , chirality can be included in our formalism .",
    "in the next section two diagrams for the evolution of the genetic code are presented assuming that the two possible combinations ( @xmath11 , l ) and ( @xmath12 , d ) for the chirality of bases triplets and amino acid were present since a beginning .",
    "the diagrams frozen at certain step displaying two different genetic codes ; the one that corresponds to the combination ( @xmath11 , l ) giving the present day living systems standard code . guided by these diagrams , in section iii",
    ", we consider the quaternionic representation of both codes and assign type quaternions to l- and d - amino acids in such a way that , for a given  d - amino acid , the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of the corresponding to the enantiomer l. section iv is devoted to show the advantages of the quaternionic representation by considering the folding of l- and d - proteins .",
    "some remarks are finally made in section v.",
    "here we generalize , by including chirality , the diagram proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the genetic code evolution .",
    "first we take into account that miller - urey like experiments on the synthesis of organic molecules in a primordial environment@xcite show the formation of amino acids in racemic mixtures . also , as we have already mentioned , by studying the affinity of amino acids with small rna - oligonucleotides the preference of _",
    "d_-  and l - bases triplets by l- and d - amino acids , respectively , has been observed@xcite , so we assume that from the beginnings , the two chirality systems ( _ d_-bases / l - amino acids ) and ( _ l_-bases / d - amino acids ) evolve independent one of the other . moreover ,",
    "as we describe next , the proposed evolution diagrams for the two systems are very similar since we assume that the changes in the corresponding genetic codes are basically independent of the chirality .",
    "chirality just manifests in settling the two affinity systems .     triplets . ]    to construct our diagram of the code evolution in ref .",
    "@xcite we have followed crick@xcite and have considered that , in the first evolution steps , only the second base of the bases triplets was effective in codifying ( binding ) amino acids . here",
    "we assume that this fact is valid for the _ l_-bases triplets as well as for the _ d_-ones .",
    "accordingly only four l- ( d- ) amino acids could be codified , each one by one of the four enantiomers @xmath13 ( _ i_-cytosine ) , @xmath14 ( _ i_-guanine ) , @xmath15 ( _ i_-uracil )  and @xmath16 ( _ i_-adenine ) ( _ _ i__@xmath17 ( @xmath12 ) , respectively ) independently of which the first and third bases are . in figure [ fig-01 ] , that sketches this first step of the codes evolution , this fact is denoted with a rectangle containing the four letters .",
    "this is consistent with crick 's suggestion that only a few amino acids were coded at the beginning .",
    "according with the diagram , @xmath13 would codify j - alanine ( a@xmath18 ) ; @xmath14 , glycine ( g ) ; @xmath19 , j - valine ( v@xmath18 ) and @xmath16 j - aspartic acid ( d@xmath18 ) ( _ i_,j = _ d_,l or _",
    "l_,d ) whatever the first and third bases are .",
    "it is worth noting here that the four amino acids that we assume were the first ones to be codified are the first four in the trifonov@xcite consensus temporal order scale for the appearance of the amino acids ( column of natural numbers in figure 2 ) .",
    "the four amino acids a , g , v and d were also the first four that appeared under simulation of the primitive earth conditions in miller experiments@xcite .",
    "we must also point out  the two reading frames we are considering : @xmath20 for _ d_-triplets and @xmath21 for _ l_-triplets .    in figures [ fig-02 ] and 3",
    "we show how the evolution follows for the pairs ( _ d_,l ) or ( _ l_,d ) , respectively .",
    "since confusion is not possible , we have ignored the subindices that denote chiral class for notation simplicity .    as the left ( right )",
    "part of diagram of figure 2 ( 3 ) shows , our version of the primitive code is highly degenerate : in principle each of the four amino acids , a@xmath18,g , v@xmath18 and d@xmath18 , could be encoded by @xmath22 codons ( see also figure 1 ) . physically the idea of degeneration is closely related with the concept of symmetry and a very illustrative form to think about these concepts is by doing an analogy with the energy levels of an atom . in our case",
    "we would have four levels indexed each one with the letter corresponding to the second codon base , say @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( main quantum number ) .",
    "we thus assume that , as the code evolves , the symmetry that causes that the amino acid codification be independent of the first ( third ) base of the codon , disappears .",
    "because of this symmetry breaking , a part of the degeneration also disappears . in the diagrams each of the four initial levels splits into four new levels , one for each of the possible bases ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) at the first ( third ) place of the codon ( secondary quantum number ) .",
    "now we have a total of @xmath23 levels indexed each one by two letters ( the first and second ( second and third ) bases of the codon ) .",
    "each level is fourfold degenerate in the codons third ( first ) base .",
    "one of the new levels follows codifying the same amino acid as before that the level splits whereas the other three codify a new amino acid each .",
    "we indicate with an arrow the four groups of codons that conserve the amino acid and with a simple line those that substitute the amino acid by a new one .",
    "as the code follows evolving it suffers new breaking of symmetry so that the third ( first ) base of some codons bring into use or , in the atomic analogy , some of the fourfold degenerate levels split into two levels  each one twofold degenerate .",
    "those levels pointed out with an arrow follow codifying the same amino acid whereas the other levels substitute it for a new one .",
    "eventually , in subsequent steps , a few of the twofold degenerate levels split once more given two non - degenerate levels each .",
    "this is the case of codons that codify methionine ( m@xmath18 ) , tryptophan ( w@xmath18 ) and ( again ) the stop signal .",
    "the case of isoleucine ( i@xmath18 ) is a particular one since the split level coincides with the twofold one which represents the two codons that follow codifying the same amino acid . this way , isoleucine is the only amino acid which is coded by three codons . the stop signal is also threefold degenerate since it is coded by two groups of codons one twofold degenerate and the other one non - degenerate . at this step of the evolution",
    "the code frozen to give what would be its present form .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the code evolution gives as a particular result that the amino acids serine ( s@xmath18 ) , arginine ( r@xmath18 ) and leucine ( l@xmath18 ) are ( would be ) at present coded by two groups of codons each one . in the three cases",
    "one of the groups is fourfold degenerate and the other one is twofold degenerate , so that these amino acids are the only three which are sixfold degenerates .",
    "we point out this property in the diagrams with a broken line linking the two groups of codons .",
    "the two groups of codons that codify the stop signal are also linked by a broken line .",
    "we remark again the similarity of the two evolution diagrams which means that , in our description , the symmetry breaking and the code freezing must depend of causes other than chirality .",
    "we observe that the diagram of figure 2 is consistent with the present day standard genetic code ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the diagram of figure 3 , on the other hand , gives the hypothetical code shown in figure 5 .",
    "actually , this code is not observed in nature .",
    "we would argue that , although our world ( and perhaps the whole universe ) has the accurate symmetry for the existence of at least two systems of homochirality , say ( _ d_-nucleic acids and l - proteins ) and ( _ l_-nucleic acids and d - proteins ) , the refinements in the decoding and synthesis machineries of living organisms , maybe looking for better robustness and optimization of error - correcting tools , have broken that symmetry by discriminating between the two systems along the evolution causing the disappearance of the second one from the earth .    . ]    . ]",
    "based on the diagrams of figures 2 and 3 , we propose , within a common formalism , quaternionic representations of the genetic codes corresponding to both homochiral combinations ( _ d_,l ) and ( _ l_,d ) according with the scheme @xmath24{ccc}% \\mathcal{b}_{\\text{\\textit{i}}}^{3 } & \\longrightarrow & \\mathcal{a}_{\\text{j}% } \\\\",

    "as such we use the particle swarm optimization ( pso ) procedure of kennedy and eberhart@xcite taking as function of fitness the difference between the coordinates of the alpha - carbon atoms calculated following the previous procedure and the corresponding experimental ones .",
    "for these last we take those directly read from the pdb ( for l - proteins ) or their mirror - images ( for d - proteins ) .",
    "we take the rmsd ( root - mean - square deviation ) as a measure of the fitness difference , using to that effect bosco k. ho 's implementation of kabsch algorithm@xcite .    actually ,",
    "it is enough to consider j = l since @xmath146 so , if we take @xmath147 with @xmath148 , then a similar relationship is verified by @xmath149 : @xmath150 we observe that if we denote with @xmath151 the point on the sphere that results of rotating the versor @xmath126 by the quaternion @xmath152 : @xmath153 ,  then the sphere point that results of rotating the north pole by @xmath154is given by @xmath155 say @xmath156is the mirror - image of @xmath157with respect to the plane @xmath158 in a cartesian axis @xmath159 ( see figure 6 ) . when we expand the two chains ( l and d ) of alpha - carbon atoms from their location on the sphere by using the previous iterative procedure they result to be the mirror - image one of the other .    in figures 7 to 9 we show the l and d enantiomers of three small proteins as obtained by using our procedure : in figure 7 of the hormone glucagon ( pdb  i",
    "d : 1gcn - length : @xmath160 amino acids ) ; in figure 8 of the ion channel inhibitor osk1 toxin ( pdb  i d : 2ck5 - length : @xmath161 amino acids ) and , in figure 9 , of a type iii antifreeze protein ( pdb i d : 1hg7 - length : @xmath162 amino acids ) . in all the cases the theoretic curves are compared with the corresponding experimental ones as obtained directly from the pdb for l - proteins and from the mirror - image of these for d - proteins .",
    "the corresponding rmsd 's for the l - proteins are : @xmath163   for 1gcn ; @xmath164   for 2ck5 and @xmath165   for 1hg7 .",
    "assuming that at the beginnings amino acids and nucleotide bases were synthesized from primordial elements in racemic mixtures and that _ d_-bases were always more affine for l - amino acids whereas _",
    "l_-bases have preferred d - amino acids , we have proposed diagrams for the evolution of genetic codes which at present would settle the correspondence between codons and amino acids looking for those affinities . actually , of both codes only that corresponding to the affinity system ( _ d_-bases / l - amino acids ) is nowadays observed on the earth . although the existence of the chiral combination ( _ l_-bases / d - amino acids ) is in principle possible , none of the organisms that live in our planet shows _",
    "l_-nucleic acids or d - proteins .",
    "however , the existence of life in other planets , including the possibility that it be governed by such a genetic code ( figure 5 ) , is an open issue .",
    "our evolution diagrams ( figures 2 and 3 ) are based on pioneering ideas by crick and introduce in a very simple way the concept of broken symmetry .",
    "the fact that the diagrams describe the degeneration breaking and the code freezing following a similar pattern for both affinities systems , ( _ d_-bases / l - amino acids ) and ( _ l_-bases / d - amino acids ) , means that we are considering that these aspects basically do not depend of the molecules chirality but of other physical , chemical and/or biological causes .    inspired by the evolution diagrams we propose a quaternions based mathematical representation of the corresponding genetic codes .",
    "we assign to each nucleotide base an integer quaternion , so the codons are triplets of such quaternions .",
    "the representation assigns to each triplet another integer quaternion that is associated with one of the 20 amino acids ( type quaternions ) .",
    "the bases quaternions belong to the set of eighth prime integer quaternions of norm @xmath36 and the nucleotide bases chirality is  introduced by partitioning this set into two subsets ( eqs .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 5 ] ) of cardinality @xmath7 each with their elements mutually conjugates and associating their elements with the _ d_- and _ l_-bases , respectively .",
    "the correspondences between triplets of quaternions and type quaternions for both chiral combinations , ( _ d_/l ) and ( _ l_/d ) , are given by functions ( eqs .",
    "[ 7 ] and [ 8 ] ) that use the sum and ordinary product of quaternions and is such that the type quaternions assigned to both enantiomers of a given amino acid are mutually conjugates .",
    "apart of preserving the degeneration of the genetic codes as it should be , our representations distinguish among other mathematical representations of the genetic code because they assign quaternions to the amino acids as a final result so that , in view of the close relationship between quaternions and spatial rotations , a door towards the study of the proteins folding opens . in this context",
    "we propose an algorithm to go from the primary to the tertiary structure of l- as well as d - proteins .",
    "the algorithm uses , besides the integer type quaternions , a set of real quaternions associated with the order of the amino acids in the protein sequence .",
    "these order quaternions are basically the same ones for l- and d - proteins so the algorithm is such that for a given primary sequence the 3d structure of the l- and d - proteins are the mirror - image one of the other .",
    "finally , another observation about this algorithm whose critical step is the building of the quaternion @xmath166(eq . [ 11 ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite we use for it an expression that involves the ordinary product between the type quaternion corresponding to the position @xmath127 and all the others .",
    "however such expression is not adequate for describing with a common set of order quaternions the folding of l- and d - proteins . to overcome this problem , in this article ,",
    "we have changed the ordinary product by a dot product between type quaternions . as a consequence",
    "the number of sets of order quaternions that adjust a given protein diminishes so that the search for the unique set that describe the folding of all the proteins ( if it exists ! ) would be facilitated .",
