    "quantum coherent control has found way into many applications , including nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , quantum information processing ( qip ) , spintronics , atomic physics , etc .",
    "the simplest control technique is dynamical decoupling ( dd ) , also known as refocusing .",
    "the goal of preserving coherence by averaging out the unwanted couplings is achieved most readily by running precisely designed sequences of uniformly - shaped pulses @xcite .    in a closed system",
    ", the corresponding performance can be analyzed in terms of the average hamiltonian theory@xcite . to leading order ,",
    "the evolution over the refocusing period @xmath1 is indeed described by the time - averaged hamiltonian of the system in the `` rotating frame '' defined by the control fields .",
    "generally , the average hamiltonian is constructed as a series in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "the number of the leading terms of this expansion that are exactly zero determines the order @xmath2 of the refocusing sequence .",
    "larger @xmath2 imply asymptotically more accurate refocusing , with error terms scaling to zero faster with decreasing @xmath1 .    for an open system ,",
    "the dynamics associated with the bath degrees of freedom can be also averaged out , as long as they are sufficiently slow . with leading - order ( @xmath3 ) refocusing ,",
    "the state decay processes are dramatically suppressed@xcite , with a moderate decrease of the dephasing rate@xcite , while with second - order refocusing ( @xmath4 ) both decay and dephasing are strongly suppressed@xcite .",
    "the decoherence analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite was based on the assumption of the low - frequency oscillator bath being near thermal equilibrium .",
    "this assumption becomes questionable if the bath has sharp spectral features ",
    "e.g . , if the controlled qubit system is coupled to a local high-@xmath5 oscillator . on the other hand , such a situation where the controlled system is coupled to an oscillator mode is quite common .",
    "this situation is realized in atomic physics , where the oscillator in question is the cavity mode , while the continuous - wave ( cw ) excitation is used to suppress the coupling@xcite .",
    "in several quantum computer designs , nearly - linear oscillator modes are inherently present ( e.g. , mutual displacement in ion traps , or qcs based on electrons on helium ) . finally , there are suggestions to include local high-@xmath5 oscillators in the qc designs to serve as `` quantum memory '' @xcite , `` quantum information bus''@xcite , or as a part of the measuring / control circuitry@xcite .    in this work we consider dynamical decoupling in a system where the spectral function of the oscillator bath has a sharp resonance .",
    "we include the resonant mode and the corresponding couplings in the system hamiltonian , and consider the dynamics of the closed system driven by the refocusing pulses applied to the qubits only .",
    "we construct the average hamiltonian for a situation where one of the qubits is driven by a single symmetrical one - dimensional @xmath0-pulse . to second order ,",
    "the expansion is characterized by three parameters , two of which can be turned to zero by pulse shaping .",
    "an analysis of any refocusing sequence is then reduced to computing an ordered product of evolution operators for individual pulses .",
    "we illustrate the technique by analyzing the controlled dynamics of a single qubit coupled to an oscillator .",
    "one of the analyzed sequences provides an order @xmath4 qubit refocusing for any form of qubit  oscillator coupling .",
    "the simulations done for the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian show excellent qubit fidelity with strongly - suppressed oscillator heating , as long as the oscillator frequency bias exceeds the small coupling between the qubit and the oscillator remaining in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we argue that results of ref .   for corresponding open system remain applicable as long as this _",
    "renormalized _ coupling is small compared to the resonance width .",
    "the main idea of dynamical decoupling is to drive the system in such a way as to average out the effect of unwanted hamiltonian couplings .",
    "obviously , this only works if the control fields are large compared with the other terms of the system hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "the easiest situation to analyze is where `` hard '' @xmath7-function pulses are used . in this case",
    "the system hamiltonian can be ignored altogether during the action of the pulse . for a single qubit",
    ", a @xmath0-pulse along the @xmath8-axis corresponds to the evolution operator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spin-@xmath11 operator .",
    "the evolution operator for a sequence of such pulses interrupting periods of free evolution can be written as a product of the corresponding unitaries .",
    "for example , the standard spin echo@xcite sequence of a @xmath0-pulse and a negative @xmath0-pulse in the @xmath8 direction followed by intervals of free evolution of equal duration @xmath1 corresponds to the operator @xmath12 such expressions are easily simplified using the corresponding matrix algebra . for the case of nmr , the system hamiltonian is that of the chemical shift , @xmath13 it anticommutes with the pulse unitary @xmath14 , thus @xmath15 , and the two - pulse sequence ( [ eq : seq1 ] ) simplifies to the identity operator , @xmath16 the simplicity of this formalism led to a number of strong mathematical results applicable to refocusing with ideal @xmath7-pulses . in particular , a succession of `` concatenated '' refocusing sequences provide an excellent refocusing accuracy which grows very rapidly with the number of pulses in a sequence@xcite .    in practice",
    ", however , the hard - pulse condition may be difficult to satisfy , and one has to account for the corrections associated with the action of the system hamiltonian @xmath6 during the pulse .",
    "if we denote the control hamiltonian @xmath17 , the total hamiltonian is @xmath18 the simplest 1st - order decomposition ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) amounts to adjusting the intervals of free evolution before and after the pulse , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is assumed time - independent , with the precise value of @xmath21 and @xmath22 computed in order to optimize the accuracy according to some fidelity measure .",
    "superficially , any combination such that @xmath23 appears to provide equal accuracy to first order in @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , the accuracy of the expansion relies on both @xmath24 and @xmath25 being small ; the results change non - trivially for finite - angle rotations .    a more systematic way to analyse",
    "the effect of pulse shape is in terms of the average hamiltonian theory .",
    "this is equivalent to constructing the cumulant expansion of the evolution operator in powers of the system hamiltonian in the interaction representation with respect to the control hamiltonian @xmath17 which is treated exactly .    for a system of qubits ,",
    "the single - qubit control can be written most generally as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are the usual pauli matrices for the @xmath29-th qubit ( spin ) .",
    "we assume that the qubit levels are nearly degenerate , or that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham - control ] ) is written in the rotating wave approximation with respect to the qubit working frequency , so that the system hamiltonian does not contain large terms .",
    "the control hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham - control ] ) is a sum of single - qubit terms , and the zeroth order evolution operator which obeys the equation @xmath30 can be constructed without much difficulty as a product of corresponding single - qubit operators .",
    "then , the standard prescription is to separate the fast dynamics due to control fields out of the evolution operator by the decomposition , @xmath31 , and write the equation of slow evolution for @xmath32 , @xmath33 the system hamiltonian in the interaction representation , @xmath34 , is small at the scale of the refocusing period @xmath1 , which makes the time - dependent perturbation theory ( tdpt ) expansion applicable .",

    "let us consider periodic dynamical decoupling with the period @xmath1 , @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , we request that the zeroth order evolution operator  ( [ eq : zeroth - order ] ) should also be periodic , @xmath42 ( zeroth - order refocusing condition ) .",
    "then , the hamiltonian @xmath43 is periodic , and the evolution operator over a time interval commensurate with @xmath1 , @xmath44 , can be factorized , @xmath45^n=\\exp(-in\\tau h_{\\rm ave}),\\ ] ] where the `` average '' hamiltonian @xmath46 is defined in terms of cumulants , @xmath47 the main advantage of the average hamiltonian theory is the improved convergence at large time : regardless of the value of @xmath48 , the tdpt series needs to be convergent only at @xmath49 .      for order-@xmath2 refocusing , @xmath50 , we require additionally that the first @xmath2 terms in the expansion of the effective hamiltonian vanish , @xmath51 . for a closed system ,",
    "a refocusing sequence of higher order generally offers better scaling of accuracy with the sequence period .",
    "if we denote the maximum coupling in the system hamiltonian as @xmath52 ( more precisely , @xmath53 , a norm of the system hamiltonian ) , the @xmath37-th cumulant scales as @xmath54 , while the corresponding term in the average hamiltonian @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , for order-@xmath2 dynamical decoupling , the refocusing error defined as the norm of the deviation of the unitary operator , @xmath56 , scales as @xmath57 , while the corresponding fidelity scales as @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in the same system , a refocusing sequence of higher order can be run at a slower repetition rate .",
    "additional advantage of the effective hamiltonian theory comes from its locality .",
    "the first - order effective hamiltonian ( cumulant @xmath59 ) contains only the qubit interactions present in the original hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "the terms @xmath60 contains connected pairs of such coupling terms . generally ,",
    "if we represent system hamiltonian @xmath6 as a graph , with qubits as vertices and two - qubit couplings as corresponding edges , the expansion of the @xmath37-th order cumulant @xmath35 can be represented as connected subgraphs with up to @xmath37 edges . as a result , 1st - order refocusing condition , @xmath61 , can be verified by analyzing clusters with up to two qubits ; second - order refocusing , with the additional condition @xmath62 , requires analysis of all clusters with up to three qubits , etc .",
    "this property , otherwise known as the cluster theorem@xcite , allows one to design _ scalable _ refocusing sequences whose refocusing order is independent of the system size . for a linear chain with nearest - neighbor interaction",
    ", one can achieve this by intermittently pulsing odd and even - numbered qubits .",
    "several such particular sequences of order @xmath4 and higher were demonstrated in ref .  .",
    "dynamical decoupling can be also effective against decoherence due to low - frequency environmental modes@xcite .",
    "this can be understood by noticing that the driven evolution with period @xmath63 shifts some of the system s spectral weight by the floquet harmonics , @xmath64 . with the first - order average hamiltonian for the closed system vanishing ( @xmath3 refocusing )",
    ", the original spectral weight at @xmath65 disappears altogether , and the direct transitions with the bath degrees of freedom are also suppressed as long as @xmath66 exceeds the bath cut - off frequency , @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to effective suppression of dissipative ( @xmath68 ) processes .",
    "the full analysis of decoherence , including both dissipative and reactive ( @xmath69 ) processes , in the presence of order-@xmath2 dynamical decoupling , @xmath70 , was done by one of the authors using the non - markovian master equation in the rotating frame defined by the refocusing fields @xcite .",
    "this involved a resummation of the series for the laplace - transformed resolvent of the master equation near each floquet harmonic , with subsequent summation of all harmonics .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite can be summarized as follows . with @xmath50 refocusing ,",
    "there are no direct transitions , which allows an additional expansion in powers of the small adiabaticity parameter , @xmath71 .",
    "in this situation the decoherence is dominated by reactive processes ( dephasing , or phase diffusion ) . with @xmath3 ,",
    "the bath correlators are modulated at frequency @xmath66 .",
    "this reduces the effective bath correlation time , and the phase diffusion rate is suppressed by a factor @xmath72 . with @xmath4 refocusing , all 2nd - order terms involving correlators of the bath coupling at zero frequency , @xmath73 , are cancelled .",
    "generically , this leads to a suppression of the dephasing rate by an additional factor @xmath74 , while in some cases ( including single - qubit refocusing ) all terms of the expansion in powers of the small adiabaticity parameter @xmath75 disappear .",
    "this causes an _ exponential _ suppression of the dephasing rate , so that an excellent refocusing accuracy can be achieved with relatively slow refocusing , @xmath67 .",
    "the analysis in ref .   was done for a generic thermal bath with a featureless quasi - continuous spectrum characterized by the upper cut - off frequency @xmath76 .",
    "the absence of sharp features justified an approximation where bath memory effects were essentially ignored at the scale of the decoherence time , although bath correlations at shorter times are crucial for describing the effects of dynamical decoupling .",
    "a sharp spectral feature , like a high-@xmath5 cavity mode , makes the starting point of the analysis@xcite , the non - markovian master equation involving only qubits , questionable , unless the decoherence time _ in the absence _ of refocusing is long compared with the equilibration time of the high-@xmath5 mode .      in this work",
    "we include any sharp quantum mode(s ) into the `` system '' part of the hamiltonian @xmath6 , and consider the driven quantum dynamics of the resulting closed system . compared with a system of qubits ,",
    "a quantum oscillator admits a wider variety of linear or non - linear couplings . by this reason we begin with a model of a qubit with most general couplings , @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the qubit pauli matrices and @xmath79 ,",

    "the average of the cosine over pulse duration is zero by symmetry , @xmath88 in such a case , the first two terms of the expansion , @xmath89 , of the unitary evolution operator @xmath90 in powers of pulse duration @xmath91 read : @xmath92 here the dimensionless parameter @xmath93 is the only one that characterizes the pulse shape in this order .",
    "we note that for @xmath0-pulses the sine of evolution angle is non - zero only over the duration of the pulse ; the time intervals before the beginning and after the end of the pulse where @xmath94 do not contribute to the value of  @xmath95 .",
    "because of that , this parameter can be viewed as a measure of the effective duration of the pulse . for example , while @xmath96 for an infinitely short @xmath7-pulse , for a gaussian pulse@xcite of width @xmath1 , @xmath97 this parameter is @xmath98 ( see tab .  [ tab : params ] ) .    to create a pulse shape with effectively zero width to linear order",
    ", one can compensate for positive values of @xmath99 near the middle of the interval by making @xmath83 somewhat negative near the beginning and the end of the interval .",

    "numerical results agree with the predictions from the analytically computed effective hamiltonians which show greately reduced coupling between the qubit and the oscillator .",
    "then , in the closed system , a very small frequency bias ( of order of renormalized coupling value ) becomes sufficient to effectively disconnect the oscillator mode and protect the qubit coherence .",
    "similar effect can be achieved when the finite width @xmath181 of the resonance is taken into account : for refocusing to be effective , @xmath181 must be large compared with the renormalized qubit coupling .    in other words",
    ", refocusing is effective as long as the renormalized qubit coupling with the resonant mode is small on the scale of the resonance width .",
    "this gives the modified , more broadely applicable , criterion for applicability of the results of ref .",
    "in particular , we expect the second - order sequence * 8s * with 2nd - order pulses q@xmath182 to provide an excellent refocusing accuracy to system hamiltonian of jaynes - cummings form  ( [ eq : jc - ham ] ) also in the presence of a thermal bath , as long as the refocusing rate is sufficiently high .",
    "in addition to the condition on renormalized value of the high-@xmath5 oscillator mode coupling , the refocusing period @xmath1 must be below the threshold value of order of the inverse bath cut - off frequency refocusing frequency , @xmath183 , see ref .  .",
    "in this work we analyzed the performance of soft - pulse dynamical decoupling in the presence of a sharp resonance mode .",
    "because of the associated memory effects , such a problem can not be addressed by considering master - equation dynamics for the qubit - system density matrix alone .",
    "instead , we included the resonant mode and the corresponding couplings in the system hamiltonian , and considered the dynamics of the resulting closed quantum system driven by a sequence of soft or hard refocusing pulses applied to the qubit .",
    "the analysis was done in terms of the effective hamiltonian theory which describes the evolution of the system `` stroboscobically '' at the time moments commensurate with the refocusing period .",

    "this allows an explicit computation of the error operators associated with refocusing in systems of arbitrary complexity .",
    "we also computed the effective hamiltonians for several single - qubit refocusing sequences . to quadratic order ,",

    "we illustrated the general analytical results on the specific example of the driven jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .",
    "the results of simulations agree with the predictions based on the analytically computed second - order effective hamiltonians , although in some cases the effects of higher - order terms not included in the calculation are noticeable .    for robust single - qubit refocusing , we recommend the symmetric 8-pulse sequence * 8s * applied with second - order self - refocusing pulses .",
    "this sequence provides excellent refocusing accuracy for any form of the coupling of the qubit with outside world , and it is stable with respect to pulse shape errors . as the second - order symmetric sequence , it should also work well for open systems , as long as the environment is slow on the scale of the refocusing rate@xcite .",
