    "a new group of fascinating heavy - fermion superconductors that crystallize in the hocoga@xmath0 structure was discovered a few years ago.@xcite to the superconductors of this group that have received wide attention belong cecoin@xmath0 , cerhin@xmath0 , and ceirin@xmath0 ( refs . ) .",
    "cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 are superconductors at ambient pressure , @xcite with @xmath2 and 2.3  k , respectively , whereas cerhin@xmath0 becomes a superconductor ( with @xmath3  k ) under pressure .",
    "@xcite at ambient pressure cerhin@xmath0 orders antiferromagnetically with an incommensurate spin spiral below the nel temperature @xmath4 k ( ref . ) .",
    "the entanglement of heavy - fermion behavior , antiferromagnetism , and superconductivity seems to point to an unconventional pairing mechanism.@xcite unambiguous evidence for unconventional spin - singlet @xmath5-wave superconductivity in cerhin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 was recently provided by a number of experiments .",
    "@xcite the nature of the pairing mechanism , however , could not yet be established .",
    "an important issue which has become intensively debated is the role of the ce @xmath1 electrons and their degree of localization .",
    "the high specific heat coefficients @xcite of about 300 mj / molk@xmath6 to 750 mj / molk@xmath6 for cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 , respectively , indicate at least some @xmath1 delocalization at ambient pressure .",
    "the @xmath1 localization has been studied in some detail by de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) experiments , @xcite in which especially cerhin@xmath0 received attention .",
    "@xcite although the dhva data of pure cerhin@xmath0 were initially interpreted using an itinerant band - structure calculation with delocalized @xmath1 electrons,@xcite subsequent measurements of the dhva quantities of ce@xmath7la@xmath8rhin@xmath0 indicated @xcite that the ce @xmath1 electrons remain localized for all @xmath9 .",
    "the rather low specific heat coefficient @xmath10 mj / molk@xmath6 at ambient pressure would corroborate localized @xmath1 behavior in cerhin@xmath0 . even in the localized picture ,",
    "the @xmath1 electrons are responsible for the magnetism which could , for example , through spin degrees of freedom , give rise to an unconventional pairing interaction .",
    "de haas - van alphen measurements in connection with band - structure calculations are a very useful tool to analyze a multiband situation with a complicated fermi surface .",
    "such studies have been performed for the three ce-115 compounds in question by several groups with contradictory results , however . in the case of cecoin@xmath0 ,",
    "the authors of ref .   found a reasonable agreement of the calculated dhva data with the measured values , @xcite having in their band structure three bands crossing the fermi surface ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "a similar agreement was found for the superconducting compound ceirin@xmath0 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "conversely , another recent study @xcite claimed an important influence of relativistic effects on the electronic structure of these two compounds , leading to a fourth band crossing the fermi surface which would give rise to additional dhva frequencies .",
    "if relativistic effects are important then this would obviously affect the microscopic understanding of the superconductivity ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) and possibly of the pairing mechanism , which remains an unresolved issue .",
    "another controversy was already noted and concerns cerhin@xmath0 which is antiferromagnetic at ambient pressure .",
    "the authors of ref . interpreted its dhva data by a nonmagnetic itinerant band structure calculation treating the @xmath1 electrons as valence states and stating a reasonable agreement . on the contrary ,",
    "the localized nature of the @xmath1 electrons in cerhin@xmath0 was proposed in ref .   on the basis of a comparison to the dhva data of larhin@xmath0 .",
    "localization of the @xmath1 electron was also revealed @xcite by dhva investigations of ce@xmath7la@xmath8rhin@xmath0 , but no corresponding band - structure calculation was performed up to now .    taking into account the apparent similarity within the electronic structure of all three compounds , a comparative and critical analysis of the electronic structures and de haas - van alphen quantities is highly desirable .",
    "also , performing a complete theoretical analysis of the dhva data for @xmath11 of the three ce-115 compounds using the same numerical method ( as will be presented here ) allows one to critically assess the reliability of former calculations .",
    "comparing scalar - relativistic and fully relativistic calculations will answer the discussion concerning the importance of relativistic contributions , started in ref .. in addition , comparing the co- , ir - compounds on one side with the rh - compound on the other side ( treating the @xmath1 electron as core electron or not ) may possibly prove whether the @xmath1 electrons are localized or not .",
    "for our study we use the full potential local orbital ( fplo ) method @xcite for all three compounds cecoin@xmath0 , cerhin@xmath0 , and ceirin@xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the extremal fermi surface cross sections and effective masses and restrict ourselves to @xmath12 for which most experimental data exist .",
    "we compare scalar - relativistic and fully relativistic calculations , and , in the case of cerhin@xmath0 , the localized and the delocalized descriptions of ce @xmath1 electrons . after presenting our method ( sec .",
    "ii ) and a short discussion of the resulting band structures ( sec .",
    "iii ) we describe the extremal orbits in sec .",
    "iv . the critical comparison with former calculations and experimental results ( sec .",
    "v ) allows to draw our conclusions in sec .  vi .",
    "we performed band - structure calculations using both the scalar - relativistic and the fully relativistic versions of the full potential local orbital minimum - basis band - structure method .",
    "@xcite in these calculations , the following basis sets were adopted for the valence states : the @xmath13 states for ce when the @xmath1 are treated as valence states , while for co , rh , ir and in were used @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the high lying @xmath18 and @xmath19 semicore states of ce , which might hybridize with the @xmath20 valence states , are thus included in the basis .",
    "the compression parameters @xmath21 were optimized for each basis orbital separately by minimizing the total energy .",
    "for the site - centered potentials and densities we used expansions in spherical harmonics up to @xmath22=12 .",
    "the number of @xmath23-points in the irreducible part of brillouin zone was 726 , but some pivotal calculations were made also with higher numbers of @xmath23-points .",
    "the perdew - wang @xcite parameterization of the exchange - correlation potential in the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) was used .",
    "the dhva cyclotron frequency @xmath24which is proportional to the fermi surface cross section  and the cyclotron mass @xmath25 of the extremal orbits are calculated numerically by discretizing the fermi velocities on @xmath23-points along the orbit and by a subsequent romberg integration.@xcite",
    "the compounds ce@xmath26in@xmath0 ( @xmath26=co , rh , and ir ) crystallize in the tetragonal structure , space group p4/mmm ( space group number 123 ) and are built of alternating stacks of cein@xmath27 and @xmath26in@xmath28 .",
    "we performed nonmagnetic band structure calculations for the experimental lattice parameters , which are ( in atomic units ) : @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath30 ( cecoin@xmath0 ) , @xmath32 @xmath30 and @xmath33 @xmath30 ( cerhin@xmath0 ) , and @xmath34 @xmath30 and @xmath35 @xmath30 ( ceirin@xmath0 ) .",
    "for the one special in - position we also adopted the experimental values .    the band structure of cecoin@xmath0 computed with the fully relativistic scheme",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the band structure of cecoin@xmath0 obtained with the scalar - relativistic scheme , as well as the band structures of nonmagnetic cerhin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 are only slightly different and therefore not presented here .",
    "we find for each of the ce-115 systems using either the scalar - relativistic or fully relativistic scheme three bands which cross the fermi surface .",
    "these bands are denoted as band 131 , band 133 and band 135 , according to their number in the valence band complex of the fully relativistic calculation counted from below .",
    "following the line @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the crossing points of bands 131 , 133 and 135 ( in that order ) with the fermi level are clearly visible .",
    "the influence of relativistic effects is most pronounced along the @xmath37 line , where the upper two bands 133 and 135 remain degenerate in the scalar - relativistic calculation .",
    "however , the fully relativistic effect along @xmath38 and at other places in the brillouin zone ( bz ) have only minor influence on the fermi surface .",
    "we find only small differences in the extremal fermi surface cross sections which will be discussed in the next section .    also , the differences in the band structures calculated for the three compounds cecoin@xmath0 , cerhin@xmath0 , and ceirin@xmath0 are small .",
    "for example , in the fully relativistic calculation of cerhin@xmath0 , band number 133 does not cross the fermi level between @xmath39 and @xmath40 in variance to fig .  1 , where it just crosses the fermi level . as a result ,",
    "the two extremal orbits ( for @xmath41 ) of band 133 which are centered around the @xmath39 point for cecoin@xmath0 are no longer closed orbits for cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "instead , one finds for cerhin@xmath0 corresponding orbits which are closed around other points in @xmath23-space , however .",
    "cerhin@xmath0 differs in its physical properties from the other two compounds and a debate concerning the localization of the ce 4@xmath42 electron has emerged.@xcite below we will see that the agreement between calculated and measured dhva frequencies is indeed significantly worse for cerhin@xmath0 ( in comparison to the co- and ir - compounds ) if we treat the ce @xmath1 electrons itinerantly .",
    "therefore , we present in fig.[fig2 ] the result of a fully relativistic band - structure calculation for cerhin@xmath0 , where its ce @xmath1 electron was treated as a core electron ( @xmath1-c scheme ) . by comparison with fig .  1",
    "one can easily conclude that the seven , nearly dispersionless bands in fig .  1 , situated at about 0.5 ev",
    "are of ce @xmath1 character .",
    "these bands are especially clearly visible above the fermi level at @xmath39 and @xmath26 , but they are mixed with other bands elsewhere and the lowest one drops below the fermi level between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . by calculating additionally the atomic character within each band ( not shown ) we have found that the bands which cross the fermi level in fig .",
    "1 have a considerable @xmath42 character as well .",
    "especially pronounced is the @xmath42 character at the fermi energy between @xmath44 and @xmath43 , as well as between @xmath40 and @xmath45 .",
    "considerable @xmath42 character below the fermi energy exists only at the high - symmetry points @xmath45 and @xmath40 .",
    "other states which contribute significantly at the fermi energy are the in @xmath19 orbitals .",
    "this is especially true for the bands centered around the @xmath39 and @xmath26 points . if we compare the energy bands in figs .  1 and 2 between @xmath26 and @xmath43 , or between @xmath26 and @xmath44",
    ", we find in both cases three bands crossing the fermi energy .",
    "the two upper bands ( bands 133 and 135 in the fully relativistic case ) give rise to closed orbits centered at @xmath26 which are of predominantly in @xmath19 character and present at @xmath46 irrespective of the treatment of the ce @xmath1 electrons . however , the areas are different .",
    "the same is true for the two , electron - like bands , centered around the @xmath39 point . in the present study ,",
    "we did not try to interpret the dhva data of cerhin@xmath0 with a band - structure calculation taking into account the correct low - temperature antiferromagnetic order of that compound .",
    "let us shortly compare our band - structure results with those published already in the literature .",
    "we find that our fplo result agrees best with the flapw band structure @xcite published for ceirin@xmath0 .",
    "this agreement concerns also the corresponding fermi surfaces and , for cecoin@xmath0 it holds as well ( see refs . and ) . the relativistic linear augmented - plane - wave ( rlapw ) calculations published in ref .",
    "show in contrast to our results a fourth band crossing the fermi surface .",
    "the corresponding band in our calculation can be seen in fig .  2 at about 0.4 ev _ above _",
    "@xmath46 at the @xmath26 point and it consists mainly of in @xmath19 character",
    ". it could drop below the fermi level due to the use of a non - optimal basis set .",
    "the nonrelativistic band structure of cecoin@xmath0 published in ref . shows a rough agreement with our results with respect to the band characters , but considerable differences due to relativistic effects exist near @xmath46 .",
    "for instance , due to the lack of spin - orbit splitting , the @xmath1 band complex is much narrower there.@xcite finally , band - structure results and the corresponding fermi surface of cerhin@xmath0 were reported in ref .. whereas the band structure is quite similar to our results , there exist some differences in the calculated dhva data as well as in the assignment of the measured dhva frequencies .",
    "based on the band - structure results , we calculated the dhva frequencies and effective masses for all extremal orbits with @xmath11 .",
    "the most relevant calculations were performed in the fully relativistic scheme for which a complete analysis has been performed and which are compared with the scalar - relativistic calculations .",
    "the individual extremal orbits were already shown in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "( see also refs .   and ) which we therefore not repeated here . for clarity sake",
    "we also use the same notation@xcite except for one minor modification : in some cases the orbit @xmath47 does not exist and is broken into two other orbits which we then denote as @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the band numbers in tables i  iii refer to the valence bands in the fully relativistic scheme counted from below as introduced in the previous section . in the case of",
    "cerhin@xmath0 we present also some dhva data for the most prominent fermi surface sheets which we calculated using the @xmath1-c scheme .",
    "we did , however , not attempt to identify all the experimentally observed orbits .",
    "lastly , we note that some orbits in either the scalar- or fully relativistic scheme are not presented because they do not exist as a closed , extremal orbit .    .calculated dhva frequencies @xmath24 ( in kt ) and effective masses @xmath25 ( in @xmath50 ) for cecoin@xmath0 with @xmath11 .",
    "the calculations were performed treating the ce @xmath1 electrons as delocalized and adopting either the scalar - relativistic or the fully relativistic approach .",
    "the notation of the extremal orbits can be found in ref .  .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table6 ]    the compound * cerhin@xmath0 * exhibits a remarkably different behavior .",

    "in addition , in the existing experiments only the main branches could be unambiguously assigned.@xcite in table [ table5 ] we therefore compare only the experimental and theoretical results for these main branches .",

    "if we would start our interpretation of the dhva frequencies in cerhin@xmath0 with treating the ce @xmath1 electrons as valence electrons in the fully relativistic scheme , then we immediately observe an important difference with regard to both cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 : whereas the experimental data are slightly larger ( up to 10 percent ) than the theoretical values for the later two superconducting compounds , they are up to 10 percent _ smaller _ for cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the results obtained with the @xmath1-c scheme fit much better in the general chemical trend . since there is no 4@xmath42 contribution at the fermi level the volume enclosed by the fermi surface shrinks and so does , consequently , the corresponding areas of extremal orbits . as a result the theoretical values are now _ smaller _ than the measured ones in accordance with the general trend in the series ce@xmath26in@xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the absolute deviation from the experimental values is not significantly improved .",
    "what concerns the effective masses , these are enhanced in cerhin@xmath0 as well , but only moderately .",
    "the experimental value for the mass @xmath62 of orbit @xmath51 is @xmath63 ( ref .  ) or @xmath64 ( ref . ) , respectively , whereas theoretically it was found to be 1.48 ( in the fully relativistic scheme ) or 0.55 ( in the @xmath1-c scheme ) , see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding values for orbit @xmath65 are : experiment : @xmath66 ( ref .  ) or @xmath67 ( ref . ) , and theory : 0.95 ( rel . ) or 0.47 ( @xmath1-c ) .",
    "although the inclusion of @xmath1 orbitals into the valence - band complex enhances the effective masses even in lsda , that does not necessarily advocate delocalized @xmath1 s .",
    "instead , it can be expected that the dominating mass enhancement in cerhin@xmath0 occurs because of a strong interaction between conduction electrons and magnetic fluctuations , which is not taken into account in our calculation , however . under pressure",
    "the antiferromagnetic order disappears in cerhin@xmath0 yet the spin fluctuations and their interaction with the conduction electrons intensify , as suggested by the pronounced increase observed for the effective dhva masses.@xcite    to confirm our interpretation of localized @xmath1 behavior , we calculated in addition the angular dependence of the dhva frequencies of the main branches treating the 4@xmath42 electrons as core states .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as can be seen , the characteristic angular dependence of the various branches is well reproduced .",
    "the calculated splitting of the @xmath65 and @xmath68 branches is larger than the experimentally observed splitting , the reason why remains an open question at the moment .",
    "the related compound larhin@xmath0 displayed also a larger @xmath69 splitting.@xcite if we would have displayed the results calculated treating the @xmath1 electrons as itinerant , then the theoretical branches would lie much higher than the experimental ones and the agreement would be much worse .",
    "thus , our calculations support the picture of reasonably localized @xmath1 behavior in cerhin@xmath0 , at variance with the much more delocalized @xmath1 behavior in cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] one can also see the multitude of low - frequency orbits , the origin of which could be resolved only by band - structure calculations taking the antiferromagnetic ordering into account .",
    "( open points , from ref .  ) in comparison to the theoretical ones , calculated with the fully relativistic fplo scheme and treating the ce @xmath1 electron as core electron ( filled symbols ) . ]",
    "our investigation of the electronic structures and dhva quantum oscillations in the ce-115 corroborate the following picture of these materials . in cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 the ce @xmath1 electrons appear to be rather delocalized .",
    "therefore , treating the @xmath1 electrons in these two compounds like itinerant states we do obtain a good description of the measured dhva frequencies . however , the experimental effective masses of the extremal orbits are considerably enhanced over the band - structure effective masses . in spite of the substantial many - particle enhancement of the masses in the proximity of the heavy fermion state",
    ", it is surprisingly how well the fermi surface cross sections are described by the band - structure calculations .",
    "the behavior of cerhin@xmath0 differs from that of cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 . in order to provide an explanation of the main dhva branches of cerhin@xmath0 , taking into account also the chemical trend in the series cecoin@xmath0ceirin@xmath0",
    ", we find that it is better to treat the ce @xmath1 electrons as localized .",
    "this finding is in agreement with some of the observed differences between the rh - compound and the co- and ir - compounds , as , e.g. , the lower specific heat and the antiferromagnetic order of the rh-115 compound .",
    "the antiferromagnetic structure leads additionally to a multitude of low - frequency dhva branches that are not detected for the other two compounds , an explanation of which would require a careful study of the fermi surface of the antiferromagnetically ordered compound .",
    "the mass enhancement observed within the ce-115 series is most likely due to spin fluctuations as well as charge fluctuations , but it comes about in a different manner for cerhin@xmath0 .",
    "the moderate enhancement of the latter ce-115 compound occurs due to spin fluctuations on top of the ` frozen ' magnetic state .",
    "the appreciable mass enhancement in cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 , on the contrary , seems to be related to the more itinerant @xmath1 electrons , which have a substantial weight near the fermi energy and , in addition to being responsible for the fluctuating spin polarization , charge fluctuations of the @xmath1 s can now contribute to the mass enhancement , also .",
    "another mystery is why the deviating behavior occurs for the rh - compound and not , for example , for the ir - compound .",
    "it was noted earlier that small changes in the lattice parameters of the rh - compound do already lead to a physical behavior very similar to that of cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0,@xcite but this does not provide a microscopic explanation .",
    "the small nel temperature of cerhin@xmath0 ( @xmath70 3.8 k ) suggests that all three compounds could be close to antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "this gives an indication of what the pairing mechanism of the unconventional superconductivity @xcite could be .",
    "most likely significant antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are present in all three compounds at low temperatures , the strength of which depends delicately on the ce - interplane distance ( i.e. , the @xmath71 ratio ) .",
    "the @xmath71 ratio apparently also has a pronounced influence on the localization degree of the ce @xmath1 states .",
    "if the antiferromagnetic interaction is not strong enough to achieve antiferromagnetic ordering the next favorable order parameter is superconductivity , which might still benefit from the antiferromagnetic fluctuations present .",
    "the fact that the superconducting order parameter has unconventional @xmath72-symmetry@xcite might also correspond to an unconventional pairing mechanism , however , it has been shown that this must not always automatically be so.@xcite    the discussion of the origin of the unconventional superconductivity also touches upon the importance of relativistic effects , as claimed in ref .   .",
    "in the later work , substantial differences between the fermi surfaces computed with the scalar- and fully relativistic approximations were reported .",
    "in contrast , we find in our investigation that the results of the scalar- and fully relativistic schemes are very similar for all the ce-115 compounds .",
    "in particular , no fourth band crossing the fermi level is found .",
    "therefore , there is apparently not a compulsory reason for a fully relativistic description of the superconductivity in the ce-115 compounds . +",

    "<S> we report a critical analysis of the electronic structures and de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) quantities of the heavy - fermion superconductors cecoin@xmath0 , cerhin@xmath0 , and ceirin@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structures are investigated _ ab initio _ on the basis of full - potential band - structure calculations , adopting both the scalar- and fully relativistic formulations within the framework of the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to another recent study , in which a pronounced change of the fermi surface due to relativistic effects and therefore the importance of relativistic interactions for the superconductivity was claimed , we find only minor relativistic modifications of the band structure in our calculations . the _ ab initio _ calculated dhva quantities are in good agreement with experimental data for cecoin@xmath0 and ceirin@xmath0 , when we adopt the delocalized lsda description for the ce @xmath1 states . for cerhin@xmath0 , however , a better agreement with experiment is obtained when the ce @xmath1 electron is treated as a localized core electron . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for an emerging picture of the localization behavior of the @xmath1 electron in these materials are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore compare our calculated dhva quantities with other recent relativistic calculations and discuss the differences between them . </S>"
