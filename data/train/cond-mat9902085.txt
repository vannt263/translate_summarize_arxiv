    "the behavior of charged , fluctuating systems is an old problem in chemistry and physics and is of importance for very diverse disciplines . in this article",
    "we will be concerned with the distribution of counter ions around charged objects , which is experimentally realized whenever an object with dissociable surface groups is brought in contact with water ( or some other high - dielectric solvent ) . in such a situation",
    ", the counter ions will be attracted to the oppositely charged object , but also repelled from other counter ions .",
    "the characteristic feature of charged systems is that the coulomb interaction is long - ranged , which gives these systems very special properties .",
    "since , in general , one counter ion interacts with many different counter ions simultaneously , the mean - field approach is very successful and can be used to describe experiments or simulations quantitatively .",
    "exact solutions of the so - called poisson boltzmann equation , which determines the electrostatic potential distribution on a mean - field level , are available for planar@xcite and cylindrical@xcite geometries . a very readable introduction into the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) approach is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "there are several factors which contribute to deviations from the pb equation , including additional , short - ranged interactions and solvent effects . in this article",
    "we will consider deviations due to _ fluctuations and correlations_. these effects have been incorporated for the single charged wall by modified pb equations @xcite , by integral equation theories@xcite , and by numerical methods@xcite .",
    "in general , one finds correlation effects to become important for ions of high valency , and packing effects dominate the ion distribution for very bulky ions or high ion concentration . for the case of counter ions or electrolyte solutions between two charged walls ,",
    "there have been a number of studies using integral equations@xcite and monte - carlo methods@xcite .",
    "an exhaustive review has been given by attard@xcite .",
    "the main result of these studies is that correlations can lead to an effective attraction between similarly charged walls for high enough ion valency .",
    "there have been a few attempts of using field theoretic methods to go beyond mean - field theory for charged systems .",
    "here we only mention the works by podgornik and zeks@xcite and by attard and coworkers@xcite , who expanded around the mean - field solution and calculated within additional approximations fluctuation corrections to the interaction between two charged , planar walls .",
    "in this article we consider a system of mobile , point - like counter ions in the presence of a fixed charge distribution , and formulate the field - theoretic framework for going beyond the poisson - boltzmann description .",
    "as has been realized by many others before , the poisson - boltzmann equation constitutes the _ saddle point _ of the exact field theory .",
    "we first reformulate this theory by a loop - wise expansion around the saddle point .",
    "the poisson equation , which relates the electrostatic potential to the counter ion distribution , is obeyed at each level of this loop expansion .",
    "clearly , the counter - ions are not distributed according to the boltzmann weight , and correlations and fluctuations lead to pronounced deviations from the poisson - boltzmann predictions .",
    "the description is considerably facilitated by a legendre transformation , after which we obtain the gibbs potential as a function of a fixed electrostatic potential distribution .",
    "this transformation restricts the number of diagrams to so - called one - particle - irreducible diagrams .",
    "the electrostatic potential is given by the solution of the equation of state .",
    "we then apply this general formalism to the case of counter ions confined to a half space and next to a charged wall .",
    "we calculate without further approximations the one - loop correction to the electrostatic potential distribution and the counter - ion distribution .",
    "due to correlations the counter ions are more densely packed close to the wall than predicted by the pb solution .",
    "this is in accord with previous monte - carlo simulations and with the intuitive expectation , since mean field usually overestimates repulsive interactions due to the neglect of correlations .",
    "the relative importance of fluctuation corrections to the electrostatic potential is measured by the single parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the surface charge density of the planar surface , @xmath3 is the distance at which two elementary charges interact with thermal energy , and @xmath4 denotes the counter - ion valency",
    ". since the thickness of the counter ion distribution is , according to the mean - field prediction , given by @xmath5 , the average counter - ion concentration follows as @xmath6 and our effective fluctuation parameter can be rewritten as @xmath7 and thus measures the electrostatic interaction energy between two counter ions at their average separation ( in units of the thermal energy ) ; it is thus related to the plasma parameter . for vanishing values of @xmath1 mean field theory becomes exact and fluctuation corrections are unimportant . on the other hand , since the counter ion valency comes in as a cubic power , it is clear that by going from monovalent to divalent ions , fluctuation effects become much more pronounced , in accord with experiments and simulations .",
    "our results , which are obtained only to first order in the loop expansion , become unreliable for large values of @xmath1 . a clear break down of our expansion is indicated by an unphysical negative density of counter ions , which occurs at @xmath8 .    in section ii we formulate the general field - theoretic description for an ensemble of fluctuating counter ions in the presence of a fixed charge distribution .",
    "the main steps consist of i ) formulating the initial partition function as a field theory using a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , ii ) going to the grand - canonical ensemble , iii ) expanding the action around the saddle - point , and iv ) performing another legendre transformation after which the gibbs potential depends on the electrostatic potential . in section",
    "iii we show how the electrostatic potential follows from the equation of state , and in section iv we give explicit results for the case of a single charged wall . in section v we calculate the effective interaction between charged test particles , and section vi is devoted to a brief discussion .",
    "the partition function for @xmath9 mobile counter ions of valency @xmath4 , interacting with an arbitrary fixed charge distribution , @xmath10 , reads @xmath11 \\exp\\left\\ { -q^2 \\sum_{j > k } v({\\bf r}_j   - { \\bf r}_k ) + q \\int { \\rm d } { \\bf r } \\sigma({\\bf r } )   \\sum_j v({\\bf r } - { \\bf r}_j ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ] we assume the counter ions to be point - like particles , and only include the coulomb interaction between ions , @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is the bjerrum length defined as @xmath13 .",
    "we also neglect any image charge effects in the present formulation of our theory .",
    "the charge distribution @xmath10 in general also contains test particles , the presence of which allows to calculate the effective interaction between charges , as we will demonstrate in section vi . introducing the particle density operator @xmath14 we can rewrite the partition function as @xmath15 = \\frac{1}{n ! } \\left [ \\prod_{i=1}^n \\int { \\rm d } { \\bf r}_i \\right ] \\exp\\left\\ { - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int { \\rm d } { \\bf r } { \\rm d } { \\bf r } ' [ q \\hat{\\rho}({\\bf r } ) - \\sigma({\\bf r } ) ]   v({\\bf r}-{\\bf r } ' )   [ q \\hat{\\rho}({\\bf r } ' ) -\\sigma({\\bf r } ' ) ] + \\int { \\rm d } { \\bf r } \\hat{\\rho}({\\bf r } ) h({\\bf r } ) \\right\\}.\\ ] ] there is no need to subtract the diagonal terms involving self interactions at this point , because they will be canceled by a one - point renormalization at a later stage . using the generating field @xmath16",

    "in this section we calculate the effective interaction between charged test particles . as mentioned before ,",
    "test particles can be incorporated into the model by adding them to the charge distribution in eq.([model1 ] ) according to @xmath146 where we have considered a collection of @xmath147 test particles with charges @xmath148 and positions @xmath149 . inserting this shifted charge distribution into the grand - canonical partition function eq .",
    "( [ zlambda ] ) , the reduced test - particle free energy turns out to be @xmath150 using the separation of the fluctuating field @xmath125 into the expectation value @xmath55 and the fluctuations around the expectation value , eq.([sep ] ) , the free energy can be reexpressed as @xmath151 using the loop - expansion of the electrostatic potential , @xmath55 , eq.([psiexp ] ) , and the definition of the self interaction , @xmath152 , eq.([gselfdef ] ) , the free energy becomes on the one - loop level @xmath153   + \\frac{q_j^2}{2q^2 } g_{\\rm self}(z_j ) \\right\\ } + \\sum_{j < k}^m \\frac{q_j q_k}{q^2 } g({\\bf r}_j,{\\bf r}_k)\\ ] ] and thus separates into a single - particle part and a two - particle part .",
    "the single - particle contribution contains the ordinary gouy - chapman potential , @xmath87 , given by eq.([psi0 ] ) , a contribution due to fluctuation - induced changes of the electrostatic potential , @xmath154 , given by eq.([psi1 ] ) , and a contribution due to correlations between counterions and a test particle , @xmath155 , given by eq.([gselfsol ] ) .",
    "since the correlation contribution is attractive and proportional to the square of the test - particle charge , it will be dominant for large test - particle charge and lead to attraction even in the case of a similarly charged wall .",
    "this somewhat surprising behavior has in fact been seen in monte - carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "we note that on the two - loop level , in addition a three - point interaction appears .",
    "finally we will present results for the interaction between two particles in the neighborhood of the charged wall and thus under the influence of the loosely bound counter - ion cloud . to make the results somewhat more transparent",
    ", we will confine ourselves to particles which have the same vertical distance from the wall .",
    "the effective interaction then follows by fourier transformation and reads @xmath156 where the green s function @xmath157 is determined by eq.([gsol ] ) and @xmath158 denotes the bessel function of the first kind@xcite . for particles which are very close to each other , @xmath159 , and/or",
    "very far apart from the charged surface , @xmath160 , the interaction is basically unscreened and given by @xmath161 for particles that are far apart from each other , @xmath162 , but close to the surface , @xmath163 , the effective interaction is given by @xmath164 the main feature is that the effective interaction is screened and thus reduced compared to the bare coulomb interaction , but the screening is much weaker than for example in a salt solution and the interaction decays as an inverse cube of the distance .",
    "this behavior has previously been predicted by liquid - state calculations and is interpreted as the effective dipole - dipole interaction between the test - charges and their associated counter - ion clouds@xcite .",
    "the effective interaction between two induced dipoles is unscreened because the lower half - space is assumed to be impenetrable to ions and thus allows the unattenuated passage of electric field lines . from eq.([g1 ] ) it follows that the screening is maximal at a finite distance away from the wall .",
    "this is connected with the maximum in the counter - ion distribution , see fig.4 . for particles that are far apart from each other , @xmath162 , and also relatively far apart from the surface , @xmath165 , the effective interaction is given by @xmath166 and thus increases gradually as one move away from the surface . at a separation from the surface which equals the interparticle distance , @xmath167",
    ", the effective interaction has the same magnitude as the bare coulomb interaction , and we find the effective interaction to cross over smoothly to the bare interaction as given by eq.([g0 ] ) .",
    "in this article we have formulated the non - linear field theory for mobile counter ions under the influence of fixed charge distributions .",
    "we showed explicitly that the poisson - boltzmann equation corresponds to the saddle - point equation , and how correlations and fluctuations can be accounted for by a loop - wise expansion of the action around this saddle point .",
    "we find the poisson equation to be satisfied at each order in this expansion . clearly , the boltzmann equation is not satisfied when going beyond the saddle point , and this is the reason for deviations from the poisson - boltzmann equation .",
    "particularly useful is the introduction of the gibbs potential @xmath168 $ ] , which only contains one - particle irreducible diagrams ( and thus reduces the number of diagrams to be considered ) and which allows to directly calculate the electrostatic potential distribution via the equation of state .",
    "we applied our formalism to the case of a charged wall which is impenetrable to counter ions and obtained , to one - loop order and without further approximations , the electrostatic potential , the counter - ion distribution , and the effective interactions between test particles .",
    "we find that the counter - ion density is increased close to the wall as compared to the mean - field ( poisson - boltzmann , pb ) solution , however , right at the wall the density is unchanged as compared to pb .",
    "the increase close to the wall is due to correlations between counter ions , which are not captured in the pb approach and which reduce the repulsion between counter ions .",
    "the surface potential is increased at the surface .",
    "the relative strength of the one - loop correction is proportional to the single parameter @xmath169 and thus is proportional to the cube of the counter ion valency .",
    "our results become unphysical at @xmath170 .",
    "the value of @xmath171 up to which our results are accurate could only be inferred from quantitative comparisons with numerical simulations , which we plan to do in the future .",
    "our formalism can in principle applied to all situations where the pb equation can be solved in closed - form .",
    "it would be particularly useful to obtain the one - loop correction for a charged wall in a salt solution , because this would represent the bridge between debye - hckel and poisson - boltzmann theory .",
