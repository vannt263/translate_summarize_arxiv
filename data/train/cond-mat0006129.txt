    "nonequilibrium processes , their stationary states and their phase transitions have been of considerable interest in natural science as well as in medicine and sociology for many years .",
    "here we are interested in processes that can be modelled by growth and decay of populations with spatially local interaction rules .",
    "the transition between survival and extinction of a population is a nonequilibrium continuous phase transition phenomenon and is characterized by universal scaling laws .",
    "it is well known that also for systems far from equilibrium the concept of universality classes with respect to their critical properties in the vicinity of a continuous phase transition is applicable . for the description of transitions in systems that show active and absorbing inactive states , percolation models play an outstanding role .",
    "some years ago it was conjectured @xcite that markovian growth models with one - component order parameters displaying a transition into an absorbing state in the absence of any special conservation law generically belong to the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) .",
    "besides dp @xcite this universality class includes e.g. reggeon field theory ( rft ) @xcite , the contact process @xcite , certain cellular automata @xcite and some catalysis models @xcite",
    "( for a recent review of dp processes see @xcite ) .    despite the fact that a large variety of different models belong to the dp universality class ,",
    "_ there is still no experiment where the critical behavior of dp was seen _ @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "hinrichsen compares suggested experiments and discusses possible reasons why the observation of dp critical exponents is obscured or even impossible .",
    "one of these reasons might be that the basic feature of the dp class , the existence of an absorbing state , is quite difficult to realize in nature .",
    "small fluctuations will always affect this state and may be strong enough to soften the transition like a small particle source , which works as an external field @xcite .",
    "another reason might be the influence of spatial quenched disorder which is abundant in reality .",
    "we have shown @xcite that in contrast to equilibrium systems , the critical scaling properties of dp processes are not only altered by frozen randomness , but fully destroyed .",
    "for the analytic description of universal behavior near a critical nonequilibrium transition , it is often useful to model the universality class by mesoscopic stochastic processes involving the order parameter and other relevant fields . in case of the dp class a representation by the langevin equation for the time - development of the particle density ,",
    "the gribov process ( the stochastic version of the so - called schlgl model @xcite ) , is appropriate .",
    "the name gribov process was coined by grassberger who showed that rft is a markov process in disguise rather than a quantum theory @xcite . on the level of a formulation of stochastic processes by means of path integrals",
    ", there is superficially no difference between rft and the gribov process .",
    "however rft uses creation and annihilation operators for particles as the principal fields in contrast to the particle density and its conjugate response field in the gribov process .",
    "microscopically the rft - description of dp starts with special reactions between diffusing individuals on a given @xmath1-dimensional lattice such as birth : @xmath2 , competition : @xmath3 , and death : @xmath4 .",
    "these reactions are represented by a master equation that is mapped onto a second - quantized bosonic operator representation , which is in turn mapped onto a bosonic field theory using the continuum limit @xcite . at the critical point",
    "the rates of birth and death have to balance to yield a vanishing overall production of individuals . but this condition leads to strong local correlations and the microstates of the system consist typically of clusters of individuals embedded in the vacuum @xcite .",
    "thus , a fluctuating density description for the gribov process is appropriate on a mesoscopic level .",
    "note that _ the replacement of the spontaneous single particle death reaction by a two particle reaction @xmath5 leads to strong anticorrelations because now the birth rate itself has to vanish at the critical point_. in this case , the microstates consist of separated lonely wanderers that only sporadically interact and no clustering of individuals sets in .",
    "_ for such problems of branching and annihilating random walks one is forced to use the creation - annihilation operator formulation _ @xcite and a naive stochastic density description for the fundamental field would lead to wrong results . as a general rule : one can show that branching processes lead to positive correlations and annihilation processes to anticorrelations with the exception of spontaneous decay , which does not generate any correlations .",
    "nonvanishing branching and spontaneous decay are needed to yield positive correlations together with the possibility of a vanishing overall production of particles at the critical point . in such cases",
    "a mesoscopic density description is correct .",
    "_    instead of considering only one species of particles as is usually done for processes belonging to the dp class , it is of interest to introduce processes with several interacting species as for instance in mathematical biology @xcite , which are also of relevance for a special model of surface growth @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to describe the detailed field - theoretic investigation based on renormalization group methods of such _ colored and flavored directed percolation processes _ ( mdp ) realized by the gribov process for several species .",
    "we group different colored species in the same flavor class , if they have equal transport properties .    in the next chapter",
    "we introduce the model and define its renormalization and the one - loop calculation in the third chapter . in chapter iv , we present the general renormalization group analysis and find the asymptotic scaling behavior to one - loop order . in chapter",
    "v , we include the two - loop results of the appendices and show the crossover to unidirectionality of the couplings between the different species",
    ". in chapter vi , we present our considerations on symmetries and the general fixed point properties of the model .",
    "we show that the permutation symmetry of a multicolored process is spontaneously broken .",
    "a brief account of this work has been presented in @xcite .",
    "in addition , in chapter vii , we will show that the universal multicritical features of a recently introduced model of unidirectional coupled directed percolation processes ( ucdp ) by tuber et al .",
    "@xcite , which contains an additional linear coupling between the species , is completely described by the mdp class . in the last chapter",
    "we discuss the results and give an application to biomathematics .",
    "three appendices present technical details , e.g.  the @xmath6-expansion of the dp - exponents , known for a long time , but as yet unpublished .",
    "the mesoscopic description of the dynamics of physical systems is based on a correct choice of the complete set of fundamental slowly - developing fields . in general",
    "these are the order parameter densities and the densities of conserved quantities .",
    "the multispecies processes under consideration are completely described by the particle densities @xmath7 of the percolating colored and flavored individuals .",
    "we assume that there does not exist any conservation law .",
    "next one has to find out the general form of the stochastic equations of motions of the fundamental fields as timelocal ( markovian ) langevin equations .",
    "these langevin equations have to respect symmetries and general principles characterizing the universality class under consideration .",
    "the mdp - class is characterized by the following four principles :    1 .",
    "errorfree self - reproduction ( `` birth '' ) and spontaneous annihilation ( `` death '' ) of individuals .",
    "the rates for birth and death may be different for each color .",
    "interaction between the individuals ( `` competition '' , `` saturation '' ) with color - dependent couplings . 3",
    ".   diffusion ( `` motion '' , `` spreading '' ) of the individuals in a @xmath1-dimensional space with flavor - depending transport coefficients .",
    "4 .   the states with at least one extinct color are absorbing .    in the language of chemistry , the mdp",
    "may be realized microscopically by an autocatalytic reaction scheme of the form @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where the last reaction subsumes the interactions of individuals with colors @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 may be the integers @xmath14 .",
    "a description in terms of particle densities typically arises from a coarse - graining procedure where a large number of microscopic degrees of freedom are averaged out .",
    "the influence of these is simply modelled by gaussian noise - terms in the langevin equation which however have to respect the absorbing state condition .",
    "the stochastic reaction - diffusion equations for the particle densities in accordance with the four principles given above are of the form @xmath15 where the first term on the right hand side models the ( diffusive ) motion , and the @xmath16 are the overall reproduction rates of the particles with color @xmath11 .",
    "these deterministic terms are constructed proportional to @xmath17 in order to ensure the existence of an absorbing state for each species . near the absorbing transition",
    "the particle densities @xmath18 are small quantities . expanding the rates @xmath16 in powers of @xmath18 results in @xmath19 the gaussian noises @xmath20",
    "must also respect the absorbing state condition , whence @xmath21 subleading terms in the expansions ( [ 2],[3 ] ) as well as additional terms with derivatives of the spatial @xmath22-function in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) are not displayed .",
    "it can be shown that they are irrelevant in the renormalization group sense as long as the stability condition @xmath23 for all @xmath24 is fulfilled .",
    "the breakdown of this condition signals the occurrence of a discontinuous transition to compact growth and the appearance of tricritical phenomena at the border between first and second order transitions .",
    "such a behavior is expected in microscopic models based on more complicated particle reactions @xcite .",
    "the `` temperature '' variables @xmath25 measure the difference of the rates of death and birth of the color @xmath11 .",
    "thus the temperatures may be positive ore negative .",
    "we are interested in the case where all @xmath26 ( up to fluctuation corrections ) which defines the multicritical region . under these conditions",
    "all the species live on the border of extinction .",
    "the next step is a mean field investigation of homogeneous steady state solutions of the equations of motion . neglecting all fluctuations in eq.([1 ] ) and using the expansion ( [ 2 ] ) up to first order in @xmath27",
    "we find easily that all @xmath28 as long as all @xmath29 , meaning the vacuum is absorbing for each color .",
    "as soon as some of the temperatures become negative , stationary solutions with @xmath30 emerge , satisfying the corresponding equations @xmath31 .",
    "thus , in general a multitude of hypersurfaces of first and second order transitions exist in the phase space spanned by the relevant temperature variables @xmath32 which separate the phases where a specific color becomes extinct .",
    "whenever @xmath33 changes from a negative to a positive value , the order parameter @xmath34 undergoes a continuous or a discontinuous phase transition from an inactive absorbed state with @xmath35 to an active state with @xmath30 .",
    "all hypersurfaces of phase transitions meet in the multicritical point where all temperatures are zero .",
    "all homogeneous states are globally stable because the evolution of the total particle density of homogeneous states in time is given by @xmath36 .",
    "thus all solutions of the mean field equations of motion are bounded to a finite region in the space of positive @xmath34 as long as the stability condition mentioned in the foregoing paragraph holds .    in the following we focus on the effect of fluctuations on the scaling behavior of correlation and response functions in the vicinity of the multicritical point where the strongly relevant parameters \\{@xmath37 } are small . in order to apply field - theoretic methods and the renormalization group equation in conjunction with an @xmath38-expansion about the upper critical dimension @xcite , it is convenient to use the path - integral representation of the underlying stochastic processes @xmath39 @xcite . with the imaginary - valued response fields denoted by @xmath40 , the generating functional of the connected response and correlation functions , the greens functions , takes the form @xmath41=\\ln \\int { \\cal d}\\bigl[\\widetilde{n},n \\bigr]\\exp \\biggl(-{\\cal j}\\bigl[\\widetilde{n},n\\bigr]+\\int d^{d}x\\int dt \\bigl(hn+\\widetilde{h}\\widetilde{n}\\bigr)\\biggr)\\ .",

    "the dynamic functional @xmath43 $ ] and the functional measure @xmath44 $ ] , which in symbolic notation is proportional to @xmath45 , is understood to be defined using a prepoint ( ito ) discretization with respect to time .",
    "the prepoint discretization leads to the causality rule @xmath46 in response functions which forbids response propagator loops in the diagrammatical perturbation expansion @xcite .    the langevin equations ( [ 1]-[3 ] ) are recast as a dynamic functional    @xmath47    in the second line we have neglected subleading terms .",
    "correlation and response functions can now be expressed as functional averages of monomials of the @xmath17 and @xmath48 with weight @xmath49 . a glance at eq .",
    "( [ pathint ] ) shows that the responses are defined with respect to additional local particle sources @xmath50 in the langevin equations ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "a rescaling of the fields @xmath51 , @xmath52 leaves the functional @xmath53 forminvariant but transforms the coupling constants @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus invariant coupling constants are given by @xmath56 .",
    "a suitable rescaling is defined by @xmath57 .",
    "if we choose this normalization , we denote the rescaled fields by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    the scaling by a suitable mesoscopic length and time scale , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( with @xmath62 )",
    "respectively , leads to @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "hence @xmath66 is the upper critical dimension .",
    "it is now easy to show that all neglected possible subleading terms in the expansion of @xmath67 and the noise correlation , as well as higher gradient terms in the langevin equation  ( [ 1 ] ) and non - gaussian and non - markovian noise correlations , have coupling constants with negative @xmath68-dimensions near the upper critical dimension .",
    "therefore , under the renormalization group flow , they are renormalized to zero and we can safely neglect them because we are interested in the leading universal critical behavior .",
    "these couplings can be reintroduced if one is interested in corrections to scaling . in a renormalized field theory context @xcite , the @xmath68-dimensions of the coupling constants are equal to the so called naive or engineering dimensions .",
    "all coupling constants with positive naive dimensions ( the relevant couplings with respect to the gaussian fixed point as the starting point of the perturbation expansion ) need a renormalization because the corresponding vertex functions are the only ones which develop primitive divergencies in perturbation theory .",
    "thus the field theory based on the functional @xmath69 ( eq .  ( [ 4 ] ) ) is renormalizable and the calculated scaling properties are universal for the full class of mdp - processes .",
    "now we are in a position to develop the perturbation theory in the inactive phase with all the @xmath29 . to begin with we separate the anharmonic `` interaction '' terms from the dynamic functional @xmath69 , eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , and retain only the harmonic ones : @xmath70 here we have included the external sources @xmath71 and @xmath72 . the gaussian path integral @xmath73\\exp ( -{\\cal j}_{0})=\\exp ( ( h , g\\widetilde{h}))$ ] involves only non - negative fields @xmath74 as long as @xmath75 .",
    "it yields the propagators for the fourier transformed fields @xmath76 etc .",
    ", as @xmath77 where the heaviside theta - function is defined with @xmath78 following from the ito - discretization of the path - integral and ensuring causality .",
    "besides the propagators , the anharmonic coupling terms in @xmath53 , eq.([4 ] ) , define the elements of the graphical perturbation expansion .",
    "they are depicted in fig .  1 where an arrow marks a @xmath79-leg and we draw diagrams with the arrows always directed to the left ( ascending time ordering from right to left ) .",
    "1 . elements of the graphical perturbation expansion    fig .",
    "1 shows that the color of a @xmath79-leg on the left side of a vertex is not annihilated : at least one @xmath80-leg on the right side displays the same color .",
    "thus , going from left to right , i.e.  backward in time , through a diagram , colors have only sources and no sinks .",
    "this property is a consequence of the existence of absorbing states in the model .",
    "the perturbation expansion of a translationally invariant field theory can be analyzed by the calculation of the vertex functions @xmath81 corresponding to the one - particle irreducible amputated diagrams . here",
    "the sets @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote the colors of the amputated outer @xmath79-legs and @xmath80-legs respectively .",
    "going backward in time we conclude from the conservation property of the @xmath79-colors that the colors of the set @xmath84 must appear as a subset of @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the only nonzero two and three point vertex functions are @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . moreover",
    ", another property follows directly from color conservation : the vertex function @xmath88 does not depend on parameters @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 with colors other than the ones of the vertex functions itself .",
    "thus , @xmath85 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are only functions of the parameters @xmath94 , @xmath25 , and @xmath57 and are in particular independent from the interspecies couplings @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "therefore these vertex functions are the same as the corresponding functions of the well analyzed one - species gribov process .",
    "to calculate them one can set the interspecies couplings @xmath97 .",

    "<S> a model of directed percolation processes with colors and flavors that is equivalent to a population model with many species near their extinction thresholds is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we use renormalized field theory and demonstrate that all renormalizations needed for the calculation of the universal scaling behavior near the multicritical point can be gained from the one - species gribov process ( reggeon field theory ) . in addition </S>",
    "<S> this universal model shows an instability that generically leads to a total asymmetry between each pair of species of a cooperative society , and finally to unidirectionality of the interspecies couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in general the universal multicritical properties of unidirectionally coupled directed percolation processes with linear coupling can also be described by the model . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the crossover exponent describing the scaling of the linear coupling parameters is given by @xmath0 to all orders of the perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> as an example of unidirectionally coupled directed percolation , we discuss the population dynamics of the tournaments of three colors .    </S>",
    "<S> key words : multicolored directed percolation , field - theoretic renormalization group , stochastic population dynamics , </S>"
