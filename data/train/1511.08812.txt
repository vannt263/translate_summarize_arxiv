    "attempting to determine the density of the material near the plane of the galactic disk in the solar neighbourhood is an old endeavour , dating back to the pioneering work of @xcite and @xcite , with many subsequent studies over the years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the most direct method that may be employed is one - dimensional ( i.e. it ignores the radial force ) with the vertical velocity dispersion used in the jeans equation to determine the vertical force acting on the stars .",
    "this is typically justified by arguing for the dominance of these terms over all the other terms , including the so - called ` tilt ' term in the vertical force expression , which depends on @xmath0 ( the mean product of the radial and vertical velocities ) .",
    "then , using the poisson equation , one is able to recover the matter density .",
    "these kinds of studies are restricted to near the plane of the galaxy , i.e. the thin disk region , and have been undertaken using ever more complete datasets with varying estimates for the dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood . as the stellar surface density near the galactic plane may be ascertained by direct observations , any mass discrepancy with the dynamical estimate using the tracer stellar populations is attributed to the presence of dark matter . while there is considerable uncertainty , both from observational errors , as well as difficulties in separating the dynamically old stellar populations , generally the estimates  pc is approximately @xmath1 , using old red giant stars from the _ hipparcos _ catalog in the disk @xcite . ]",
    "are on the order of @xmath2",
    ". such measurements of the galactic disk surface density therefore offer a means of constraining the properties of dark matter . for a very recent discussion of observational difficulties related to these kinds of studies , see @xcite .    as the data available for the stellar dynamics in the milky way continue to improve",
    ", it is interesting to contemplate going beyond the thin disk , inferring both vertical and radial forces from the jeans equation and using the full poisson equation , without restricting to the vertical dynamics alone .",
    "a recent study along these lines was undertaken by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as mb12 ) , where the dark matter density was determined to be significantly lower than previous estimates ( @xmath3 ) , with the caveat that multiple approximations and assumptions were required in the analysis .",
    "subsequent to this , the study by @xcite ( hereafter referred to as bt12 ) proposed that this result could be explained by modifying one of the assumptions made by mb12 concerning the dependence of the average azimuthal velocity on the radius .",
    "in bt12 the assumption of @xmath4 , as used in mb12 , was discarded as unphysical , and the radial force term was assumed negligible , leading to a lower limit on the local dark matter density from a purely vertical analysis .",
    "this apparently restored @xmath5 to a value similar to those previously reported in the literature .",
    "the analysis of bt12 has , however , been shown to be incorrect in @xcite ( hereafter referred to as mb15 ) , as a vanishing radial force term ( using the mb12 data ) requires that the vertical gradient of @xmath6 is too steep , disagreeing with observations both of the milky way and of external galaxies . furthermore , although the assumption about @xmath7 used in mb12 is indeed unphysical , relaxing this assumption and using the sparse observational data available in the analysis results in a negligible change in the calculated dark matter density , as demonstrated in mb15 . hence",
    ", further investigation is needed to determine the reason for the unusual results of mb12 .    in this work",
    "we will use the full three - dimensional kinematic data from simulations in an attempt to demonstrate the efficacy or otherwise of this approach , to analyse which parameters are most crucial to the analysis , and to provide some insight into possible reasons for the results of mb12 . a study investigating the one - dimensional method using simulations",
    "was undertaken in @xcite , using a thin disk galaxy model . here",
    "we will be concerned with the full three - dimensional formulation , considering model data of galaxies with thick disks .",
    "we will also utilise state - of - the - art simulations in which disk galaxies are formed in a cosmological context , including many associated physical processes , both environmental and secular , rather than limiting ourselves only to idealised simulations .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ jeansequation ] we derive the form of the jeans equation that we will use , carefully stating the assumptions used to simplify the terms ; in section  [ data ] we will summarise the simulated data that we use for this work and how we measure the various quantities required for the jeans equation ; in section  [ results ] we show the surface densities calculated from the kinematics of our various simulation datasets to test how well the method works in an ideal case of perfect information and investigate which parameters are most crucial to an accurate measurement , as well as discussing the potential impact of our results on previous observational studies of this sort ; and finally we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the jeans equations , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath8 , for a tracer stellar population of an axisymmetric system in a steady - state are : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the _ total _ gravitational potential , @xmath12 is the stellar density distribution , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the radial , azimuthal and vertical velocities respectively .",
    "all these kinematic quantities refer to the kinematics of the test stellar sample used to probe the galactic potential .",
    "the surface density @xmath15 is then calculated from the kinematics by using these expressions for the forces in the poisson equation , integrated in the vertical direction : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the surface density as a function of height .",
    "as all terms in the expression for the forces are assumed symmetric in @xmath18 ( which makes physical sense for a disk galaxy ) we integrate over half the symmetric interval of integration and multiply by 2 all terms on the left hand side .",
    "note that we will evaluate these terms at the radius @xmath19  kpc , roughly corresponding to the solar galacto - centric radius . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to a directly `` measured '' surface density in a simulation as the `` true '' surface density , denoted @xmath20 and the surface density calculated _ via _ the jeans and poisson equations as @xmath21 .        at this stage",
    "we begin to make some assumptions regarding the form of the terms in the jeans equation , in a similar manner to those made in mb12 .",
    "note that , in general , it is only the test tracer population that need satisfy the following assumptions , not the disk as a whole .",
    "the disks of our simulated galaxies , however , have only a single component , thus we apply these assumptions to the whole disk . + * assumption 1 * - the density has an exponential drop - off in both the vertical and radial directions : @xmath22 .",
    "we furthermore assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constants , i.e. there is no dependence on height or radius for these values .",
    "+ checking the density profiles of the simulation data directly this assumption is seen to be generally valid , with the caveat that the radial scale length @xmath23 ( and that of the radial velocity dispersion @xmath25 ) typically increases somewhat with height , violating the second part of assumption 1 .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the kind of analysis utilised in mb12 and so we choose to measure the radial density profile at a single height given by the vertical bin closest to the plane of the disk .    given this assumption for the density , we can rewrite eq .  [ jeansforces ] as : @xmath26 for the vertical force and @xmath27 where",
    "we have written the left hand side as it appears in eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] , the vertical integration of the poisson equation .",
    "this integral over @xmath18 means we need not calculate the derivatives with respect to @xmath18 appearing in eq .",
    "[ jeansforces_radial ] , but the @xmath18 derivative in the fourth term of eq .",
    "[ jeansforces_vertical ] remains .",
    "these expressions are strictly only valid for positive values of @xmath18 .",
    "the more general expression , valid for positive and negative @xmath18 , would include occurrences of the @xmath28 function which arises due to taking a derivative of @xmath29 in @xmath30 .",
    "note that in mb12 the authors incorrectly assumed that the fourth and fifth terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ jeansforces_radial ] would vanish from the integration over @xmath18 due to the antisymmetry of @xmath0 . to see that this is not true",
    ", we can restore the @xmath31 function to those terms : @xmath32 the antisymmetry in @xmath18 of @xmath0 ( and @xmath33 ) combined with the antisymmetry of @xmath28 ensure that these terms are symmetric and thus do not vanish upon integration over a symmetric interval in @xmath18 .",
    "this is also to be expected based on the symmetry in @xmath18 of the radial force , as we now demonstrate .",
    "the second term in the expression for @xmath34 in eq . [ jeansforces ] gives rise to the two terms highlighted in eq .",
    "[ restoredterms ] .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath35 in @xmath18 due to the dependence on @xmath29 combined with the antisymmetry of @xmath36 means the function within the derivative is antisymmetric in @xmath18 .",
    "when differentiated with respect to @xmath18 this function becomes symmetric in @xmath18 , and thus this whole term is symmetric in @xmath18 as anticipated for the radial force .",
    "the analysis in mb12 used the radial and vertical velocity _",
    "dispersions _ rather than the mean squared radial velocities .",
    "the two are of course related by @xmath37 both @xmath38 and @xmath39 are assumed in mb12 to be zero , as expected for a system in a steady - state equilibrium , and so @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can then replace all occurrences of the mean squared radial and vertical velocities with the velocity dispersion .",
    "the simulation data allow us to work directly with the mean squared velocities , although we have checked that , in all simulations , the assumption of zero mean radial and vertical motions is a very accurate one , and we could just as easily have worked with the dispersions instead . for the azimuthal velocities we will replace @xmath42 in eq . [ jeansforces_radial ] using @xmath43    our second and third assumptions , again verified by checking with the simulations and shown to be in excellent agreement with the data ,",
    "are + * assumption 2 * - the squared mean radial velocity ( or the squared radial velocity dispersion ) is assumed to have an exponential drop - off with radius : @xmath44 . + * assumption 3 * - the squared azimuthal velocity dispersion is assumed to have an exponential drop - off with radius : @xmath45 .",
    "+ note that we do _ not _ restrict either @xmath46 or @xmath25 to be equal to @xmath23 , as done in mb12 .",
    "we will see later that imposing @xmath47 can lead to significant problems for some parameter sets , potentially resulting in a large negative @xmath21 at large heights , an unphysical result .    with assumptions 2 and 3 ,",
    "we may now write the terms contributing to the surface density as follows . we start with the terms that arise from @xmath48 : @xmath49 while the terms coming from @xmath34 give : @xmath50 where we have used eq .",
    "[ aziveldisp ] .      at this stage",
    "it is useful to enumerate the terms in the equation for the surface density .",
    "we will refer to these numbers when we compare with plots of the simulation data .",
    "the total list of terms , where we have made our three additional assumptions beyond reflection symmetry in the @xmath18-axis ( exponential drop - off with radius and height for @xmath51 , and exponential drop - off with radius for @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) , is given below : @xmath54 summing all these terms , and multiplying the result by @xmath55 , gives the surface density @xmath21 at radius @xmath56 . as discussed earlier terms ( ii ) and ( iv ) were incorrectly omitted from the analysis of mb12 .",
    "in simplifying the jeans equation we have assumed that the density distribution of the stellar disk is that of a double exponential profile : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the central surface density and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the scale length and scale height of the disk .",
    "to give us some guidance in the expected behaviour of the jeans equation terms , we will now calculate the radial and vertical forces for the density distribution of eq .",
    "[ analyticexp ] , using the poisson solver of the ramses n - body / hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "thus we are simply numerically solving the poisson equation using a specified analytic density distribution .",
    "note that mb15 provides examples of analytic miyamoto - nagai disk models and an nfw halo , and considers the contribution of the radial force term in these cases .",
    "our choice of an exponential disk allows a more direct comparison with the analysis undertaken in this study .    to demonstrate the effect of a dark matter halo on the vertical and radial forces",
    ", we also add a logarithmic halo density distribution : @xmath59 where @xmath60  kpc , @xmath61  km / s and @xmath62 is the halo flattening , with @xmath63 for a spherical halo , and @xmath64 for a very flattened halo .",
    "after numerically determining the vertical and radial forces , we can then use these directly in eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] to recover the surface density at a specific radius @xmath56 . doing this at @xmath65",
    "kpc , we find the dependence on height @xmath18 for the radial and vertical terms in eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] for various choices of disk parameters .",
    "we choose stellar disks with scale lengths of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69  kpc .",
    "we also add a @xmath63 dark matter halo to the disks with scale lengths @xmath67 and @xmath68  kpc , and a @xmath64 dark matter halo to the disk with @xmath70  kpc , for a total of 7 models .",
    "all disks have @xmath71  kpc , i.e. they are all thick disk models .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is clear that the true surface density changes little as one moves around the disk , whereas the calculated surface density shows wider variation .",
    "the mugs g15784 and magicc galaxies show reasonable agreement in all four quadrants .",
    "the gd1 model also shows good agreement in all four quadrants , albeit with a systematic underestimate of the surface density .",
    "the remaining models all show larger spreads . for the rades selene model and the disk without dark matter this",
    "may be partly related to noise arising from low number statistics , as the total number of particles used in the analysis ( after restriction to the `` solar '' radius ) in each quadrant is of the order of @xmath72 , whereas all other models ( except magicc g1536 ) use at least @xmath73 particles .",
    "it is also worth noting that the rades model disk exhibits some weak spiral structure .",
    "the dark matter - free disk presents particular problems for our analysis due to the assumption of an exponential vertical distribution being a poor fit to the data .",
    "this introduces errors in the estimation of @xmath24 which has a large impact on the final calculated surface density . in the case of the gd2 model",
    "the presence of a bar and weak spiral arms is likely to be the source of the azimuthal variation .",
    "finally , the problematic mugs g1536 model may exhibit azimuthal variation due to the increased substructure in the halo , as discussed earlier .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in most models the calculated surface density lines all track the _ trend _ of the true surface density reasonably well , with errors in an overall offset .",
    "thus the volume density inferred by integrating these lines between two heights will be similar in all cases .",
    "this is clearly less true for the mugs g1536 and the gd2 model , which show more variation in the slopes of the lines .        in fig .",
    "[ lownumbers ] we perform a similar experiment as shown in fig .",
    "[ azimuthaldep ] , but this time we consider smaller regions of the disk to examine the effect of using fewer particles in the analysis .",
    "we have chosen the magicc g1536 model , as the calculated surface density when averaged around the whole disk is a good match for the true surface density .",
    "the number of star particles used in the analysis of each wedge region is shown in the plot , as well as the associated range of the azimuthal coordinate showing the size of each region ( @xmath74 is the whole disk , @xmath75 is half the disk , and so on ) .",
    "it is clear that the error increases substantially as we reduce the number of star particles .",
    "note that , in order to fit the slope of the vertical velocity dispersion and the vertical scale height , we have only used bins that contain at least @xmath76 particles , otherwise the fits are heavily affected by noise .",
    "the results of figs .",
    "[ azimuthaldep ] and [ lownumbers ] illustrate the challenge of correctly inferring the surface density using this method with more realistic data .",
    "observations tend to probe a far smaller wedge of the disk than we are considering , and often do so with fewer stars , introducing two important sources of noise .",
    "returning to the specific terms of eq .",
    "[ jeansfinal ] , we now examine terms ( vii ) and ( v ) in more detail .      term ( vii )",
    "involves the mean azimuthal velocity @xmath7 in the disk .",
    "this term was the focus of bt12 where @xmath6 , poorly constrained by observations , was inferred from the requirement that the radial term of eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] vanishes , at least close to the plane of the disk .",
    "it was argued that one can safely ignore the radial term in eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] as this will be a subdominant correction to the vertical term , and that any deviation from this behaviour is argued to be in the form of a _ positive _ radial term , leading to no more than a @xmath77 _ underestimate _ of the local dark matter density when using the vertical term alone . as discussed extensively in mb15 , and in section [ analytic ] , this is not consistent with all mass models , although an exponential disk requires a very short scale length to provide a negative radial contribution ( with either a negligible amount of dark matter or a highly unlikely halo distribution that implies a radially decreasing rotation curve ) . in our simulations",
    "most of the models do indeed have subdominant _ positive _ contributions from the radial term of eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] , consistent with the results in section [ analytic ] for exponential disks embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "in bt12 it was suggested that neglecting term ( vii ) in mb12 led directly to the low dark matter density estimate .",
    "in mb15 this is shown to be incorrect , as the required _ positive _ slope in @xmath18 of @xmath6 term is far too steep to be accomodated by the observational data .",
    "we will revisit this in section [ subsub : cons_azi ] .",
    "the only models for which term ( vii ) is significant ( but still subdominant ) are the gd1 thin disk and the magicc g1536 disk .",
    "the gd1 thin disk model shows the largest contribution from term ( vii ) , although this is reduced by the negative contribution of term ( v ) to give a radial term in eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] that is small and only slightly increasing with height , as shown in fig . [ surfdensforces ] .",
    "the magicc g1536 disk shows a similar contribution from both term ( vii ) and term ( v )",
    ".    in all of our models term ( vii ) is therefore of only minor importance for the calculation of the surface density .",
    "we now turn to term ( v ) .",
    "this term involves the radial velocity dispersion @xmath78 . from fig .",
    "[ surfdenscontributions ] it is clear that term ( v ) is most important for the mugs models and particularly the model without a dm halo . as stated earlier magicc g1536 also has an appreciable contribution from this term .",
    "let us try to understand the importance of this term by looking at the coefficient of the integral shown in section [ jeansfinal ] : @xmath79 setting @xmath80  kpc and @xmath81 , the function @xmath82 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ coeffsalpha ] for various choices of disk scale length @xmath23 . in our simulations",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ coeffsalpha ] that for larger scale lengths the dependence of the coefficient on @xmath84 becomes weak for a wide range of @xmath84 values , and therefore for a wide range of @xmath25 values .",
    "this illustrates that , for large @xmath23 , a large uncertainty in the value of @xmath84 ( or equivalently @xmath25 ) does not significantly affect the contribution of term ( v ) .",
    "this behaviour is clearly exhibited by the gd2 model , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "setting @xmath47 in this model has almost no effect on the contribution from term ( v ) , as seen in the coincidence of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 lines for this model in fig .",
    "[ surfdensresults ] . for a smaller scale length disk , however , the dependence of the coefficient on @xmath84 is stronger , especially for @xmath89 or less .",
    "it becomes possible to have a large negative contribution from term ( v ) with the imposition of @xmath47 .",
    "this may be seen for the mugs models in fig .",
    "[ surfdensresults ] , where the @xmath88 line rapidly decreases with @xmath18 becoming large and negative , which is unphysical .",
    "these models have small @xmath23 but large @xmath25 , and so a significant reduction of @xmath25 leads to a large change in the contribution of term ( v ) . for the magicc models the difference between @xmath23 and @xmath25 is smaller ,",
    "so the effect of imposing @xmath47 is less pronounced , but it still leads to a negative calculated surface density .    , where @xmath81 , for different disk scale lengths.,width=264 ]    the values of the coefficient of term ( v ) , @xmath90 , are given in table  [ fitparams ] . for the mugs and magicc models",
    "the contribution from term ( v ) is positive , and large in the case of the mugs models .",
    "the rades ` selene ' model has a slight negative contribution from term ( v ) , as @xmath91  kpc and @xmath92  kpc , within the negative range of @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ coeffsalpha ] .",
    "the gd1 value of @xmath90 is much more negative than all other models , but this is cancelled by the positive contribution of term ( vii ) to give the almost flat radial force term of fig . [ surfdensforces ] .",
    "therefore , we can characterise the discrepancies between the vertical - only and three - dimensional formulation results in fig .",
    "[ surfdensresults ] by considering the coefficient of term ( v ) alone , except for the gd1 model .",
    "we now use eq .",
    "[ term5coeff ] to determine what scale length of disk leads to @xmath93 , for a given value of @xmath84 . in the case of @xmath94 , i.e. @xmath47 , then the density scale length must be @xmath95  kpc to ensure that term ( v ) does not give a negative contribution to the surface density ( or the radial force term ) . for a larger radial velocity dispersion scale length ,",
    "i.e. @xmath96 , we find a minimum density scale length of @xmath97 to ensure a non - negative term ( v ) contribution . a positive contribution from term ( vii )",
    "will , of course , counteract any negative contribution from term ( v ) , thus we do not strictly require @xmath93 to have a non - negative radial force term , and so lower values of @xmath23 would in that case be acceptable . for our galaxy ,",
    "the results of mb15 make it clear that the observations are not compatible with very large contributions from term ( vii ) .",
    "therefore , if the radial force term is to be non - negative ( or only slightly negative ) , these estimates suggest that either the density scale length of the test population is longer than the @xmath98  kpc choice of mb12 ( and certainly far larger than the value @xmath99  kpc of bt12 ) or @xmath25 is significantly larger than @xmath23 .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that the radial force term in the milky way may well be more negative than exhibited by our models .",
    "these results also suggest an approximate anticorrelation between @xmath23 and @xmath25 whereby a shorter disk scale length would imply a larger minimum value for the velocity dispersion scale lengths . for our models",
    "this is approximately true , with lower values of @xmath23 generally associated to larger values of @xmath25 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to measure these scale lengths as accurately as possible , especially given that the milky way density scale length appears to be in the region where a significant deviation in the value of @xmath25 leads to a large negative contribution from term ( v ) in the jeans equation .",
    "given the sensitivity of @xmath100 on this parameter , it is certainly possible that inaccurate choices for the scale lengths have contributed to the result of mb12 , where a surprisingly low dark matter density was reported .",
    "the lessons from the simulations are that the most crucial extra terms in the three - dimensional formulation are those involving the radial velocity dispersion and the azimuthal velocity , although both are still subdominant .",
    "furthermore , all models have @xmath101 .",
    "we will now investigate what these lessons may imply for the analysis of mb12 .      to begin with ,",
    "@xmath0 was assumed in mb12 to have a radial exponential dependence as for the squared velocity dispersions .",
    "our simulation data do not respect this assumption , with the radial dependence of @xmath0 being remarkably flat in all models , at least at the solar radius .",

    "we can , however , restore the surface density to the result of mb12 by imposing @xmath102 , a condition that is respected by all of our models .",
    "one further consequence of this condition is to imply that @xmath6 has only a weak dependence on @xmath18 . to see this",

    "the loss of term ( iii ) from the jeans equation means that we no longer have the contribution from @xmath120 at @xmath115 , causing the @xmath100 line to drop by approximately @xmath123 pc@xmath124 .",
    "clearly the surface density still barely increases with height , apparently indicating the presence of very little dark matter .     in the formulation of mb12 ( green solid line ) and of the current study ( blue solid line ) .",
    "the blue lines use @xmath102 , as is approximately true in the simulation data.,width=264 ]    if we now relax the assumption that @xmath47 , and instead choose @xmath113 ( i.e. @xmath96 in the context of section  [ subsec : radvel ] , a value that is still considerably lower than that measured in all of the simulations except rades and the idealised gd1 model ) we find the solid green and blue lines in fig .",
    "[ mb12_curves ] , where the solid green line corresponds to the original mb12 treatment of the @xmath33 term , while the solid blue line corresponds to our treatment of this term . as can be seen",
    ", the surface density is now an increasing function of @xmath18 , with no flattening .    .",
    "the radial force contribution is made positive with a rescaling of the @xmath25 parameter.,width=264 ]    this increase of the surface density is , of course , entirely due to a change in the contribution from the radial force term of eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] , from negative to slightly positive , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ mb12forces ] .",
    "this modified radial force curve is also more in line with the results of section [ analytic ] which demonstrated that even a dark matter - free exponential disk with a scale length of @xmath98  kpc should have a positive radial force contribution to the surface density .",
    "let us now obtain the local dark matter volume density from these @xmath15 curves by calculating @xmath125 where we assume that the stellar surface density is constant at @xmath126  kpc and above .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath67 in the denominator arises due to the symmetric integral interval . for the original data in the original formulation of mb12 we obtain @xmath127 pc@xmath128 , ignoring errors . setting @xmath113 in the original mb12 formulation",
    "we find instead that @xmath129 pc@xmath128 , fifteen times larger than the original estimate .",
    "using our new formulation , with @xmath47 , we find @xmath130 pc@xmath128 , a low estimate , as would be expected from the flat dashed blue line in fig .",
    "[ mb12_curves ] , although this is over twice the estimate of the original formulation of mb12 . setting @xmath113 in our new formulation",
    "we find @xmath131 pc@xmath128 , seven times larger than the estimate with @xmath47 .",
    "all of this strongly suggests that changes to the value of @xmath25 used in this method may well result in an estimate for the local dark matter volume density that , while somewhat lower than other estimates , is approximately consistent with the standard halo model value of @xmath132 pc@xmath128 ( @xcite ) .    for a lower value of @xmath23 the estimated density decreases , possibly becoming negative and unphysical .",
    "for example , using @xmath133  kpc and @xmath134  kpc , as suggested by bt12 , we find a negative density using either the formulation of mb12 or our new formulation .",
    "this is to be expected given the dependence of the contribution of term ( v ) on the scale lengths discussed in section  [ subsec : radvel ] . by scaling @xmath25 by a factor of @xmath67",
    "the estimated dark matter density becomes positive : @xmath135 pc@xmath128 .",
    "while this scaling is arbitrary , it nonetheless suggests that , if this method is to reproduce other estimates of the local dark matter volume density , we would perhaps expect larger measured values of @xmath25 than used in either mb12 or bt12 ( and a larger @xmath23 than that used in bt12 ) , possibly values more consistent with those of our simulation data .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath84 that is required to reproduce typical estimates of @xmath5 would be reduced by the inclusion of the mean azimuthal velocity term , as the positive contribution from this term , discussed in section [ meanazivel ] , further increases the surface density .",
    "a central conclusion of our work , discussed in section [ subsec : radvel ] is that the scale lengths of the velocity dispersions , and particularly that of the radial velocity dispersion , must be very carefully measured if the full three - dimensional approach is to give a sensible result .",
    "we have demonstrated that all of our simulations show @xmath136 ( and also @xmath137 ) and that simply assuming @xmath47 can lead to a catastrophic failure of the method and a completely unphysical result when calculating the surface mass density , especially for disks with a small scale length . using the data of mb12 , we have demonstrated ( in section [ revisitmb12 ] ) that tension between the result of mb12 and other studies can be removed if the assumed value of @xmath25 in the analysis is scaled up by a factor entirely consistent with those measured in these simulations .",
    "alternatively , if the condition @xmath138 is to be imposed , then the density scale length @xmath23 must be larger , possibly on the order of @xmath139  kpc .",
    "moreover , such a scaling would also modify the results of mb15 : if we wish to impose a negligible radial force term , then a less negative contribution from the radial velocity dispersion implies a less positive gradient in @xmath18 of @xmath6 , bringing this quantity in line with observations .",
    "our scaling of @xmath25 is , however , completely arbitrary as it stands .",
    "without some observational constraint we can not say that this definitely resolves the puzzle presented by the results of mb12 .",
    "high - quality observational data for the scale lengths @xmath140 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath46 , are therefore crucial for the robustness of this method .",
    "observational studies have so far been unable to tightly constrain these scale lengths , although @xcite have determined the radial velocity dispersions to have an exponential profile in @xmath56 , justifying assumptions 2 and 3 discussed earlier , and also reflected in our simulation data .    in fig .",
    "3 of mb12 several estimates for the vertical and radial disk scale lengths are shown .",
    "the spread in @xmath23 is large , with values from @xmath141  kpc to @xmath142  kpc being within the errors .",
    "as we have seen , values at the upper end of this range would lead to a significant increase in the local dark matter density volume measured from the mb12 dataset , even with @xmath47 . in @xcite the favoured value is @xmath143  kpc , considerably shorter than the @xmath98  kpc used by mb12 .",
    "if this value is accurate then our analysis would strongly suggest that the scale length of the radial velocity dispersion is likely to be much larger than the density , in order to avoid an unphysical surface density when the full three - dimensional poisson equation is applied , using the jeans equation to determine the forces",
    ".    of course all of our conclusions must be counter - balanced with the caveat that none of the models that we have analysed are intended to reproduce our galaxy .",
    "therefore , there may well be significant differences between the properties of these models , particularly in the behaviour of the velocity dispersions , and the milky way .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 is proportional to the tilt angle ( the inclination of the dispersion ellipsoids with respect to the galactic axes ) .",
    "measurements of the tilt angle indicate that the ellipsoid axis roughly points to the galactic center at any height , i.e. the tilt increases with z. one would expect that this is roughly the same in the radial direction , the tilt slowly decreasing with @xmath56 , and therefore @xmath0 decreasing also .",
    "the @xmath101 behaviour of our models is therefore rather unexpected for the milky way .",
    "furthermore , the scant observations of the scale lengths that are available suggest that @xmath25 and @xmath46 are roughly comparable with @xmath23 .",
    "if these statements are confirmed with further observations , then it appears very difficult to reconcile the results of mb12 with those of other studies .",
    "if instead we assume that all data and parameters , including the scale lengths , of mb12 are correct , what does our analysis imply ? is it possible that term ( v ) is not the culprit , and we must look elsewhere ?    let us consider the `` tilt '' term @xmath0 .",
    "all of our models have @xmath101 and a negligible contribution from the @xmath36 terms in the jeans equation .",
    "the observational situation with regards to the radial gradient of @xmath0 in our galaxy is , unfortunately , rather uncertain .",
    "again , accurate measurements of this quantity will allow us to conclusively determine whether this term can indeed be safely neglected in a jeans equation analysis . for the mb12 dataset",
    ", a linear slope of @xmath144  km@xmath145 s@xmath124 kpc@xmath107 ( assumed constant with height ) would lead to a negative contribution from the sum of terms ( iii ) and ( iv ) of no more than @xmath146 of term ( viii ) , the dominant vertical velocity dispersion term . for comparison ,",
    "the mugs g1536 model has the largest slope of @xmath147  km@xmath145 s@xmath124 kpc@xmath107 .",
    "note that the assumption of mb12 that the @xmath0 term has an exponential dependence on radius with the same scale length as the density corresponds to a slope in @xmath56 ( at the disk plane ) of @xmath148  km@xmath145 s@xmath124 kpc@xmath107 , explaining why the surface density becomes negative if we use our formulation of the jeans equation , including terms ( ii ) and ( iv ) , with all the assumptions of mb12 .",
    "it therefore seems that we would require a steep _ positive _ radial gradient in @xmath0 in order to substantially increase the radial force contribution to the surface density with this term , something not exhibited by any of our models or the mb12 observational dataset .",
    "it is nonetheless conceivable that different galactic evolutionary histories will lead to different behaviour for the @xmath0 `` tilt '' term , and its radial gradient . until more accurate data are available , however , the observations utilised in mb12 support the assertion that @xmath0 is not a significant contribution to the surface density , as do all of our models , provided the radial gradient is much less steep than for the density or velocity dispersions .",
    "the results in section [ subsub : cons_azi ] also suggest that the @xmath102 condition is consistent with both the observed low values of @xmath6 and a flat circular velocity curve .",
    "finally , we have had rather little to say about term ( vi ) , the azimuthal velocity dispersion .",
    "this term gives a negative contribution to the surface density , that becomes increasingly significant at higher heights . in all simulations @xmath137 , very roughly tracking the behaviour of @xmath25 .",
    "for the mb12 data term ( vi ) is a negative contribution of approximately @xmath149 of the vertical velocity term at @xmath150  kpc . increasing the radial scale length to @xmath151 , in a similar manner to that discussed for the radial velocity dispersion , we find a negative contribution of @xmath152 at @xmath150  kpc . for comparison , setting @xmath113 changes term ( v ) from a negative contribution of @xmath153 of the vertical velocity term at @xmath150  kpc , to a positive contribution of @xmath77 at the same height .",
    "therefore , while @xmath46 must also be observationally constrained for an accurate application of the three - dimensional method , uncertainties in this parameter do not lead to such drastic differences as in the case of the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "in this work , we have applied a fully three - dimensional method of reconstructing the disk surface density to data from simulated disk galaxies , formed in high resolution cosmological simulations that included state - of - the - art physics recipes for the various astrophysical feedback processes and star formation .",
    "these galaxies are known to satisfy many observed scaling relations and thus provide a realistic dataset for the purpose of attempting to reconstruct the surface mass density of the disk in the region of @xmath65  kpc . while we do not claim that these galaxies are simulated versions of our milky way , the fact that they have formed through cosmological processes , undergoing various secular and environmental effects throughout their evolution , provides a somewhat more realistic testing ground for the jeans equation method , using dark matter dominated galaxies .",
    "in addition we have studied idealised thin disk galaxies embedded in analytic dark matter haloes , and a dark matter - free model .",
    "we then revisited the results of mb12 , applying the lessons learned from the simulations to determine possible consequences for the jeans equation analysis applied to our galaxy .",
    "as shown in sections [ relimport ] and [ comparison1d3d ] , applying the full three - dimensional analysis to our simulated data , we find that the radial force term is usually subdominant at lower heights , and that the traditional vertical - only formulation is a good approximation , especially for vertical heights of order the thick disk scale height and below .",
    "whenever there is more significant disagreement between the vertical - only and the full three - dimensional formulations , however , ( such as for the mugs 1536 model or the dark matter - free model ) the main term responsible for this disagreement is the radial velocity dispersion , while the mean azimuthal velocity term is only a minor contribution in all models ( see sections [ meanazivel ] and [ subsec : radvel ] ) . at higher heights , however , the three - dimensional method is more accurate than the one - dimensional approximation . in section [ azimuth ]",
    "we have shown that restricting the analysis to a smaller subset of the data ( as done in observational studies ) by considering each quadrant of the disk separately leads to slightly more variation in the calculated surface densities than is present in the true surface density for some models , with more significant spread for those models with lower numbers of particles and/or structure in the disk .",
    "thus low number statistics and disk structure will contribute further sources of error for this kind of analysis .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 , poorly constrained observationally , is a subdominant term in all models , and @xmath101 in all models , with no evidence for a strong dependence on radius .",
    "the use of the condition @xmath102 , and imposing a flat circular velocity curve , implies small values of @xmath6 and a weak dependence on @xmath18 , consistent with observations and the discussion of mb15 , as shown in section [ subsub : cons_azi ] .",
    "this further demonstrates that this term alone can not account for the `` missing dark matter '' result of mb12 .",
    "taking guidance from the results of the simulations , we have therefore excluded the @xmath0 and @xmath6 terms as being capable of restoring the local dark matter volume density to results found elsewhere in the literature . assuming that the kinematical dataset of mb12 is accurate , the results from the simulations lead us to the conclusion that the only mechanism for restoration of @xmath5 to values seen in other studies is by increasing the radial scale length of @xmath78 , and possibly @xmath154 and @xmath51 ( see section [ mb12:surfdens ] ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath25 ( and @xmath46 ) would also lead to a flat ( or slightly positive ) radial force term ( as a function of @xmath18 ) in eq .",
    "[ poissonvertical ] , bringing the kinematical dataset of mb12 into line with the expectations ( even in the absence of dark matter ) for an exponential disk of scale length @xmath98  kpc , as discussed in section [ analytic ] .",
    "furthermore , if the scale length of the density is as low as @xmath155 , as claimed in @xcite , our analysis suggests we require an even larger value for the scale lengths of the velocity dispersions to reconcile @xmath103 with the kinematic data of mb12 .",
    "it must , however , be kept in mind that the entire analysis rests on the assumption that the test stellar population is indeed in equilibrium with the galactic potential .",
    "although we do not investigate this issue further in this study , it is worth noting that any kinematic heating of the stars will disrupt this equilibrium , leading to errors when using this method .",
    "the use of the three - dimensional formulation for our galaxy requires very accurate measurements of all parameters . simplifying assumptions , such as @xmath138 ,",
    "are likely to lead to considerable error in estimates of the local dark matter volume density . until accurate measurements are available , however",
    ", our study strongly suggests that the vertical - only formulation is as effective as the three - dimensional formulation up to the thick disk scale height .",
    "using data at higher heights , where the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo begins to dominate , requires the inclusion of the radial force for an accurate result , and thus is subject to more sources of error .",
    "all approaches , however , require accurate measurments of all scale lengths , and accurate kinematics of at least several hundred stars at a range of heights in order to minimise errors , especially in the measurements of the vertical velocity dispersions . with more precise observations in the future , however , the use of this kind of three dimensional analysis will be helpful in constraining the local dark matter density and the kinematical properties of the galactic disk .",
