    "consider the setup in fig .  [",
    "figure : setup ] .",
    "the circular channel around the hole is an edge of a 2d ti and therefore hosts helical edge states .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the spin - polarization axis is perpendicular to the plane of the ti .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the two counter - propagating edge channels is then given by @xmath6 where arrows indicate the spin direction .",
    "in the ground state no net current is carried from one side to the other , since the system is symmetric under a rotation of @xmath7 around the the @xmath8-axis orthogonal to the ti . however ,",
    "if a voltage is applied across the circuit , electrons can start to flow from one side to the other , say from the left to the right .",
    "this current will be proportional to the transfer matrix of the states that are occupied at the left side , but unoccupied on the right .",
    "we therefore begin by calculating this transfer matrix .",
    "when considering processes that transfers electrons from the left to the right , we can , because of the helicity of the edge states , restrict ourselves to up - spins along the upper edge , and down - spins along the lower edge .",
    "further , we introduce the coordinate @xmath9 and @xmath10 along the upper and lower edges , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalue equations along the two edges are then @xmath11 and the corresponding eigenstates can be written as @xmath12e^{-ipx_1/\\hbar},\\nonumber\\\\      |\\psi_{\\downarrow p}\\rangle = & \\left[\\begin{array}{c }                      0\\\\                      1                  \\end{array}\\right]e^{-ipx_2/\\hbar}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now thread a magnetic flux of magnetic field strength @xmath13 through the hole . to describe this we choose the vector potential @xmath14 , which translates into @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the new @xmath17-coordinates .",
    "the addition of this vector potential acts on the phase of the eigenstates according to @xmath12e^{-i(p + qbr/2)x_1/\\hbar},\\nonumber\\\\      |\\psi_{\\downarrow p}\\rangle = & \\left[\\begin{array}{c }                      0\\\\                      1                  \\end{array}\\right]e^{-i(p - qbr/2)x_2/\\hbar},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the unit of electric charge .",
    "it is therefore clear that the transfer matrix , which describes the transport of spins from the left side , @xmath18 , to the right side , @xmath19 , is given by @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we here note that under a gauge transformation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 satisfies @xmath23 , the transfer matrix transforms as @xmath24 .",
    "we have confirmed that this additional phase drops out of all physical quantities below , proving the gauge invariance of our results , and we can therefore set @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , the overall phase in the above equation will drop out of all physical quantities .",
    "this also justifies us in not having specified the chemical potential . because , as long as the spectrum is described by the same edge hamiltonian , the only role of the chemical potential is to determine around what momentum @xmath26 the relevant excitations are located .",
    "the total transfer matrix for the system will not only depend on the transfer matrix that describes the motion around the hole , but also on the matrices that describe the transfer processes between the leads and the circular edge .",
    "we will here assume that this process preserves phase coherence between the states in the leads and the ti edge states , and that it is described by a single tunneling parameter @xmath27 , which we for now set to @xmath28 to indicate perfect transmission between lead and edge .",
    "that is , the transmission is described by the identity matrix , and therefore contributes trivially to the total transfer matrix .",
    "however , we will in what follows be interested in tilting the ti by an angle @xmath29 relative to the quantization axis of the leads .",
    "it is therefore necessary to also let the total transfer matrix encode a change of basis between the leads and the ti . for this purpose",
    "we define two sets of coordinate axes , the laboratory axes @xmath30 , and the ti axes @xmath31 .",
    "we choose to describe the electrons in the leads with the coordinates in the laboratory frame , while the edge states in the ti are described by the primed coordinates .",
    "it is clear that eq",
    ".   refers to the transfer of states in the primed basis . in particular , we choose the @xmath32-axes along the direction of motion of the electrons through the circuit , while the @xmath33-axes are chosen such that they coincide when @xmath34 and @xmath35 is always perpendicular to the ti .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath30- and @xmath31-coordinates are related through @xmath36 the change of basis from the @xmath30-basis to the @xmath31-basis for the spins is then given by @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have here used @xmath38 and @xmath39 to denote the transformations from the unprimed to the primed coordinates , and the primed to the unprimed coordinates , respectively .",
    "the symbols @xmath38 and @xmath39 are chosen since they are applied at the left and right end of the system , respectively . with these definitions we are now ready to write down the complete transfer matrix for the system",
    "@xmath40 here we have made explicit the dependence of @xmath41 on the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath2 from eq .  , and on @xmath29 from eq .  .",
    "the main advantage of introducing the @xmath38 and @xmath39 matrices is that they allow us to work in the laboratory frame alone . to calculate the probability that an incoming spin @xmath42 in the left lead is transferred to a spin @xmath43 in the right lead , we now simply need to calculate the square of the corresponding matrix element @xmath44",
    "as a first example of a concrete application , we consider a system with fully spin - polarized ferromagnetic leads only containing electrons with spin - up .",
    "further , the sg spin - splitter is assumed to be oriented at an angle @xmath45 , which forces the incoming spins to split equally into both channels . because the leads only conduct spin - up electrons ,",
    "the only relevant matrix element for the scattering matrix is @xmath46 the conductance is therefore given by @xmath47 it is clear that the prominent dependence of the current on the magnetic flux @xmath48 makes this setup ideal for measuring magnetic field strength , as a potential alternative to superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) .",
    "the measurement resolution is directly set by the radius of the hole in the ti .",
    "this is of special interest because it provides a potential route for high - resolution magnetic field measurements even at room temperatures.@xcite",
    "next we note that the configuration in the previous section can also be used as a spintronics switch , with voltage used to encode 0 and 1 .",
    "the two leads can be used as source and drain , while the magnetic field is used as the gate . from eq .",
    "it is clear that a magnetic field strength @xmath49 corresponds to on and off states for @xmath50 even and odd , respectively , and we therefore define the magnetic switching quantum @xmath51    an alternative way to encode 1 and 0 is to use the currents of up- and down - spins , respectively .",
    "this requires normal leads through which both up- and down - spins can be transported .",
    "we therefore consider the same configuration , but now evaluate all four components of the transfer matrix @xmath52 : @xmath53    similarly as above , the square of the transfer matrices gives the transfer probability of the spin - polarized currents .",
    "in particular , the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath54 converts between up and down spin currents . therefore , the device relates the in and outgoing spin currents to each other through @xmath55 once again considering the special cases @xmath49 , with @xmath50 an integer , the currents transforms according to @xmath56 this means that the device can be switched between a normal lead and a not - gate , simply by changing @xmath13 by the switching quantum in eq .  .",
    "having seen how an sg ti device can be used to construct classical logic gates for spintronics , we finally turn to possible applications in quantum computing .",
    "it has been shown that a universal quantum computer can be built using only two - qubit cnot - gates and single - qubit @xmath0-gates @xcite .",
    "we here show that a sg ti spin - splitter provides a route for implementing the later of these two gates .    for this purpose",
    "we consider three sequential spin - splitters connected by normal leads .",
    "the three devices are oriented as in fig .",
    "[ figure : setup_qc ] , with the middle device oriented at an angle @xmath57 , while the first and last spin - splitters are at an angle @xmath58 . the total transfer matrix for the complete system is then given by @xmath59 when evaluated , this expression can be written as    @xmath60\\left[\\begin{array}{cc }                  e^{i\\beta_{3}/2 }     & 0\\\\                  0                & e^{-i\\beta_{3}/2 }              \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc }                  \\cos(\\frac{\\beta_{2}}{2 } )    & \\sin(\\frac{\\beta_{2}}{2})\\\\                  -\\sin(\\frac{\\beta_{2}}{2 } )   & \\cos(\\frac{\\beta_{2}}{2 } )              \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc }                  e^{i\\beta_{1}/2 }         & 0\\\\                  0                & e^{-i\\beta_{1}/2 }              \\end{array}\\right ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 .    the six physical parameters @xmath62 are more than sufficient to make the four parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 independent of each other .",
    "moreover , when all these four parameters can be chosen independently , it is possible to express any @xmath65-matrix using eq .",
    "( [ equation : qc_transfer_function ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible to implement any unitary single - qubit gate , and in particular any @xmath0-gate , through the use of three sequential solid state sg spin - splitters .",
    "in fact , the overall @xmath5-phase provided by the parameter @xmath66 can be ignored for similar reasons that the @xmath5-phase provided by the gauge transformation @xmath21 can be ignored .",
    "this phase would only be relevant if the incoming electron is further split up into one part passing through the device , and one part moving through another path joining only at the far right outgoing lead . in light of this",
    "it is useful to think of the devices as exhibiting a @xmath0-ab effect . while the ordinary ab effect arise as a consequence of interference in a single @xmath5-phase , these devices relies on a generalized @xmath0-interference effect in the relative phase and amplitude of the up and down components of the spin . to be able to create an arbitrary @xmath0-transformation ,",
    "a sequence of three devices is needed , while an individual spin - splitter gives rise to a subset of such @xmath0-transformations .",
    "finally , we note that in this calculation we have omitted transfer matrices describing the propagation through the leads .",
    "we are justified in doing so because these would be proportional to the identity and therefore only contribute to the irrelevant @xmath66 phase .",
    "we would like to end with a few comments on some of the assumptions made .",
    "first of all the tunnelling parameter @xmath27 which otherwise would have multiplied the @xmath38 and @xmath39 matrices was set to @xmath28 .",
    "it is clear that the zeroth order correction to deviations from @xmath28 is to include the factor @xmath67 in front of all transmission coefficients , which shows up as @xmath68 in the conductivity .",
    "the higher order corrections would come from particles which are reflected and travels an additional time around the loop . while such terms can introduce corrections to the interference pattern for intermediate field strengths",
    ", they would not affect the result at multiples of the switching quantum in eq .  .",
    "the reason being that additional circuits around the loop will affect the relative phase between the up and down spins by multiples of @xmath69 .",
    "such interference effect could also play a role for @xmath28 when ferromagnetic leads are used , because the down spins at the right edge will be completely reflected .",
    "this can be solved by adding another ferromagnetic lead for the down spins to escape through at the right edge .",
    "we also mention that although the setup in fig .",
    "[ figure : setup_qc ] might seem prohibitively difficult to realize in practice , the focus has here been on providing a conceptually simple explanation of the phenomenon . in fact , the only reason the middle spin - splitter is tilted at an angle @xmath70 is to make its edge states have their spin - polarization perpendicular to those of the other two . in practice",
    "it would therefore be possible to have all three devices in the same plane , if it is constructed out of two different types of 2d tis with perpendicular spin - polarization axes .",
    "we have shown that the helical edge states of a 2d ti can be utilized to construct a solid state sg spin - splitter , which when threaded by a magnetic flux gives rise to a generalized @xmath0-ab interference effect .",
    "with two ferromagnetic leads , the device can be used to accurately measure magnetic flux , as well as be used as a magnetic field gated spintronics switch . instead using normal leads , a switchable spintronics not - gate",
    "can be implemented , or when using three devices connected in sequence , a @xmath0-gate for quantum computing is achieved .",
