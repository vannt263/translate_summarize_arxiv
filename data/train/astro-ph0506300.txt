    "next to supernova explosions , stellar winds on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) make significant contributions to the recycling of chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium .",
    "the physics of agb mass loss is therefore a key ingredient for our understanding of the evolution of galaxies , as far as the recycling of matter , processed by different stellar populations , is concerned . despite considerable progress in our theoretical understanding of stellar evolution and mass loss during the last agb phase ,",
    "observational details of this critical period have remained obscure .",
    "haloes of planetary nebula ( pn ) are fossil records of the mass loss history at the tip of the agb , which , in principle , can be investigated with the plasmadiagnostic tools for gaseous nebulae .",
    "however , spectroscopy of these low surface brightness regions is extremely difficult to perform with conventional slit spectrographs .    encouraged by successful experiments with the pmas instrument @xcite ,",
    "we have employed the technique of integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) to obtain unprecedented sensitivity for the measurement of pn emission line intensities , by co - adding very many spatial elements ( spaxels ) over the field - of - view ( fov ) of an integral field unit ( ifu ) .",
    "we have used the unique light - collecting properties of the vimos ifu at the vlt for a plasma diagnostic analysis of selected targets from the catalogue of pn haloes of @xcite with the goal to measure @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and chemical composition in order to test the most recent theoretical predictions .    here",
    "we present first results from the spatially resolved spectrophotometry in the outskirts of ngc  4361 , which is a low - metallicity galactic halo object , and of the disk pn ngc  3242 .",
    "both objects are well developed pne with central stars of very similar effective temperatures , viz .",
    "of @xmath6 for and @xmath7 for , respectively @xcite . has a well defined halo at the percent level of the peak surface brightness @xcite , where recently mysterious ` rings ' have been detected @xcite .",
    "to date , no halo has been reported for . also , due to its low metal content , the electron temperature of ( @xmath8 ) is unusually large ( torres - peimbert et al .",
    "we performed vlt observations at ut3 `` melipal '' on april 17 and 18 , 2004 , using the vimos-ifu.the instrument was setup in the lr_blue mode with a spaxel scale of 067 , a fov of @xmath9 , a nominal wavelength range of 37006700   , 5.3    pix@xmath2 reciprocal dispersion , and a spectral resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "both nights were photometric , with a seeing of @xmath11 and @xmath12 fwhm , respectively .",
    "we observed each object with a series of snapshot exposures centered on the central star in order to obtain a reference in the bright part of the nebula , and a series of deep exposures in one or two halo fields as the major objective of this run : @xmath13  s centered on ngc3242 , @xmath14  s offset by 55 and 63 arcsec to the west ( halo fields ) , @xmath15 mosaic centered on ngc  4361 with 300  s each , and @xmath16  s adjacent to this mosaic to the west ( see fig .",
    "[ ngc3242map ] , fig .",
    "[ ngc4361map ] ) . internal continuum and arc lamp flatfield as well as spectrophotometric standard star exposures were taken throughout the night .",
    "the data reduction was performed with a modified subset of routines from the pmas p3d pipeline @xcite .",
    "an input list of data and calibration files was processed by an idl script such that each of the four vimos channels was treated separately , dissecting each ccd frame into four subfields which correspond to a bank of spectra from the same pseudo - slit .",
    "thus a total of 16 subfields was piped into the p3d routines , which then operated like with ordinary pmas frames .",
    "the data reduction proceeded as follows : firstly , the bias level was subtracted and cosmic ray hits were removed . secondly , a trace mask was generated from an internal continuum calibration lamp exposure , identifying the location of each spectrum on the ccd along the direction of dispersion . in order to make this procedure robust , it was necessary to truncate the spectra on each side and discard regions with contamination from adjacent spectra of a neighbouring bank . since",
    "vimos calibration spectra are taken only when the telescope is pointing to the zenith , and because of the presence of significant flexure , the trace mask had to be shifted in x and y to match the location of the actual science exposure .",
    "the offset for this task was obtained from a cross - correlation between the calibration lamp and science exposure .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath17 spectra were extracted using a simple swath extraction technique ( no profile fitting ) . after this",
    ", the data had changed from a ccd - based format to the so - called row - stacked - spectra ( rss ) format , which is a 2-dimensional image where each row represents a spectrum .",
    "as the fourth step , the rss frame was wavelength - calibrated with an arc exposure , which turned out to be a critical step since spectral line artefacts ( zero and higher order contamination ) sometimes confused the p3d line search algorithm .",
    "the last step consisted in a correction of the spectrum - to - spectrum sensitivity variation , which was performed by dividing by an extracted and normalized continuum lamp flatfield exposure .",
    "flux calibration was performed from a series of standard star exposures which were taken in different quadrants of the ifu in order to obtain an idea of the achievable accuracy .",
    "there is considerable scatter , indicating that the flux calibration is not uniform over the face of the ifu .",
    "secondly , an inspection of the standard deviation as a function of wavelength shows that only within a window of [ 4200  ,6100   ] the variation is reasonably behaved ( @xmath18  % r.m.s ) .",
    "the region of the spectra beyond 6100   presents an artifact probably due to other orders contamination .",
    "in addition , wavelength calibration in this range was not accurately enough and some spectra lacked a red continuum for h@xmath19 which prevents us for using this line in the analysis .",
    "figures  [ ngc3242map ] and [ ngc4361map ] show maps of and in the emission lines of [ o@xmath20iii]@xmath214959,5007   and h@xmath22 , respectively .",
    "various ifu defects are scattered over the fov as distinct rectangles , which needed to be discarded from the subsequent analysis .",
    "the limited accuracy of the calibration of spaxel - to - spaxel response variation is visible in some vertical or diagonal intensity enhancements , e.g.  in the [ o@xmath20iii]@xmath214959,5007   and h@xmath22 frames of .    despite these cosmetic limitations ,",
    "the fundamental morphological appearance as described in @xcite is clearly visible as far as the brighter parts of the nebulae are concerned : central star , central cavity with enhanced rim , and shell .",
    "this gross morphology can be fully explained by the combined action of thermal pressure due to the heating of the nebular gas by photo - ionization and of dynamical pressure excerted by the fast stellar wind ( cf .",
    "as can be seen from the figs .",
    "[ ngc3242map ] and [ ngc4361map ] , the surface - brightness distribution of appears to be much smoother , with no clear distinction between rim and shell .",
    "this difference in morphology may well be caused by the low metallicity , since it is known that stellar winds become less vigorous for metal - poor stars ( cf .",

    "[ profiles ] .    in order to increase the sensitivity for the outer halo regions",
    ", we co - added very many spaxels over extended regions beyond the shell to obtain an estimate of the average emission line intensity of the halo .",
    "[ halospectra ] illustrates the results . for",
    ", the average spectrum clearly confirms the presence of an emission - line halo . besides the detection of h@xmath22 , which is blended with a sky background feature",
    ", there is also the line blend of h@xmath26 and [ o@xmath20iii]@xmath274363 , the latter being important for measuring the electron temperature .",
    "we have measured mean intensities for h@xmath26 , [ oiii]@xmath274363 , h@xmath22 and [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007 of ( 8.9 , 9.9 , 19.8 , 411.9 ) and ( 51.4 , 66.8 , 114.7 , 4426.4)@xmath28  erg@xmath1s@xmath2arcsec@xmath3 for the outer and inner region of the halo respectively .",
    "obviously , the accuracy of this result would significantly benefit from higher spectral resolution , e.g.  the vimos - ifu hr modes , offering a 10-fold higher resolving power than our current data , at the expense of a 4 times smaller fov .    in the case of , however , there is no detection of halo line emission .",
    "we derived the detection limit by simulating emission lines with different intensities , which where superimposed on the co - added spectrum , and attempting to recover these lines with gaussian fits .",
    "our detection limit estimate in the halo of is @xmath0  erg@xmath1s@xmath2arcsec@xmath3 .",
    "this value is not quite 2 orders of magnitude below the rim surface brightness , i.e.   not sufficient for the typical intensity contrast of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "also for this object , suppressing the sky background with higher spectral resolution would significantly lower the detection limit , most probably down to the expected halo surface brightness on the order of @xmath30  erg@xmath1s@xmath2arcsec@xmath3 .      the background - subtracted intensity profile in [ oiii]@xmath214959,5007   for the halo of is shown in fig .  [ halo.3242 ] .",
    "we attribute small intensity ` bumps ' to the existence of so - called halo ` rings ' found recently in a number of pne @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the radial positions given by corradi et al .",
    "is good , except in a few cases .",
    "we have no indication of a ` ring ' at 25@xmath31 , and instead of the 2 ` rings ' at 40 and 46@xmath31 we found only 1 located at a radial distance of @xmath32 .",
    "our marginal detection at @xmath33 corresponds to an arc visible in fig .  1 of corradi et al .",
    "at position angle @xmath34@xmath35 , but not annotated as ` ring ' by the authors .",
    "the halo of is obviously limb - brightened , as the wide bump around 80@xmath31 indicates .",
    "these haloes are very common and are explained by hydrodynamical effects when a strong agb wind interacts with slower , less dense matter expelled earlier during the aftermath of a helium shell flash @xcite .",
    "matter piles up into a denser shell which , once ionized , is resposible for the bright limb of the halo .    the overall slope of the halo brightness ,",
    "however , is constant and can well be approximated by a power - law representaion , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 . with the reasonable assumption that in the halo all the oxygen is doubly ionized",
    "one can deduce the radial density profile of the halo as a power - law profile @xmath38 .",
    "such a rather strong density decline with distance from the star is consistent with the rather large shell expansion velocity of 36  kms@xmath2 and hints to strongly increasing mass loss towards the end of the agb evolution ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "13 therein ) .",
    "we determined the electron temperature , @xmath39 , from the [ oiii ] lines in the vicinity of the main body of the pn and at the outer edge of the halo , employing the low - density limit , using a value for the extinction of @xmath40 @xcite and the extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "we found an apparent temperature gradient across the halo : close to the pn shell ( @xmath41 , with 766 spaxels ) we have @xmath42  k , and at the halo s edge ( @xmath43 , with 4547 spaxels ) , @xmath44  k. for comparison , we determined also the electron temperatures of the rim ( i.e.  the bright part of the pn ) and the shell and found , as averages over @xmath45 spaxels , @xmath46 and @xmath47  k , resp . , in good agreement with the determinations of balick",
    "et al . ( 1993 ) .",
    "our error estimates are @xmath48  k for the halo and @xmath49  k for the pn .",
    "the existence of hot haloes has already been reported in the past for , , and @xcite , based on long - slit observations .",
    "the ( mean ) halo temperatures range from 13000  k to 17500  k , but temperature gradients have not been established .",
    "high temperatures in the halo can easily be set up by the rapid passage of an ionization front once the main pn becomes optically thin for ionizing photons @xcite . due to the low densities ,",
    "the halo matter is far from being in thermal equilibrium , and a positive radial temperature gradient will develop because the cooling rate depends on density squared .",
    "judging from the existence of hot haloes around pne with quite different evolutionary stages , the cooling times seem to be comparable with the nebular lifetime , an important constraint for hydrodynamic models .",
    "ifs has shown to be capable of performing spatially resolved spectrophotometry down to sky - limited intensity levels .",
    "we have been able to find halo emission lines down to a detection limit of @xmath0  erg  @xmath1  s@xmath2  arcsec@xmath3 , with positive detections of [ o@xmath20iii]@xmath215007,4959   , [ o@xmath20iii]@xmath274363   and h@xmath22 in the halo of .",
    "we confirmed the existence of the mysterious ` rings ' and found , for the first time , an apparent electron temperature gradient across the halo which , if confirmed , poses a challenge for evolutionary models of planetary nebulae .",
    "haloes are obviously not in thermal equilibrium , making a plasma analysis based on steady state photoionization models highly questionable . from the steep radial intensity profile of the halo",
