    "classical nonlinear systems subjected to strong periodic external driving often have several stable stationary states for which the amplitudes and phases of the forced vibrations differ in size @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest theoretical models which show the coexistence of two stable states induced by external driving is the well - known classical duffing oscillator .",
    "an anharmonic statically monostable potential can be driven into a dynamically bistable regime showing various interesting features of non - linear response @xcite , such as hysteresis , period doubling , and thermal activation when finite temperatures are considered .",
    "the external driving field with frequency @xmath0 induces an effective dynamic bistability which is manifest by the non - monotonous dependence of the amplitude @xmath1 of the stationary vibrations for varying @xmath0 . for the classical system where all potential energies are allowed",
    ", this response curve @xmath2 is smooth showing only two points of bifurcation for the related bistability .",
    "if the control parameter @xmath0 is additionally varied adiabatically , hysteretical jumps between the two stable states occur . if additional thermal noise is added to the system , the regime of bistability shrinks due to thermal escape of the metastable state .",
    "the main subject of this work is to investigate the corresponding driven _",
    "quantum mechanical _ system .",
    "the presence of time - dependent driving typically adds several interesting features to the properties of the time - independent quantum system , see for instance refs .   @xcite . in this work",
    ", the focus is laid on the non - linear response of the driven quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator in the presence of an ohmic heat bath .",
    "we show that the nonlinear response curve @xmath2 displays beyond its characteristic shape additional quantum mechanical resonances which are related to multi - photon absorptions . additionally , we show that there exists a separation of time - scales indicating that the stationary state is reached by quantum tunneling from the dynamically induced metastable to the globally stable state .",
    "in fact , by tuning the control parameter @xmath0 , several resonant tunneling transitions can be identified as resonances in the corresponding tunneling rate .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section [ model ] , the system hamiltonian is introduced .",
    "the latter is periodic in time , which allows the application of floquet theory .",
    "since we are interested in the stationary state in presence of ( weak ) dissipation , we introduce also a set of harmonic oscillators representing an ohmic heat bath . an efficient way to determine the dynamics of the system is the use of a born - markovian master equation in the floquet picture ( section [ masterequation ] ) yielding a simple master equation with time - independent rate coefficients .",
    "after straight forward diagonalization , the stationary oscillation amplitude @xmath1 and the phase @xmath3 follow",
    ". in sections [ amplitude ] and [ phase ] , the nonlinear response of @xmath1 and @xmath3 depending on the various parameters is studied in detail . in section [ restun ] ,",
    "resonant tunneling is investigated .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the applicability of our model to experimental systems before we conclude .",
    "the hamiltonian for the driven anharmonic oscillator has the form @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the mass and the harmonic frequency of the resonator , respectively , while @xmath7 gives the strength of the nonlinearity .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath8 of hard non - linearities , where the undriven potential is monostable .",
    "the external driving is characterized by the amplitude @xmath9 and the frequency @xmath0 .",
    "as it will become clear below , the driving induces an effective bistability in which quantum tunneling can be identified .",
    "we include the effect of the environment by a bath of harmonic oscillators which are bilinearly coupled to the system with the coupling constants @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the bath and the coupling to the system is given by its standard form @xmath11 we focus on the generic case of an ohmic bath with the spectral density @xmath12 with damping constant @xmath13 and cut - off frequency @xmath14 .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath15 .    to proceed , we scale @xmath16 to dimensionless quantities such that the energies are in units of @xmath17 while the lengths are scaled in units of @xmath18 .",
    "put differently , we formally set @xmath19 .",
    "the nonlinearity parameter @xmath7 is scaled in units of @xmath20 , while the driving amplitude is given in units of @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , we scale temperature in units of @xmath22 while the damping strengths are measured with respect to @xmath6 .    to investigate the dynamical behavior of the driven resonator , it is convenient to use the periodicity of @xmath23 with respect to time and switch to the floquet picture @xcite , the later being equivalent to a transformation to the rotating frame .",
    "the floquet or quasi - energies @xmath24 follow from the solution of the eigenvalue equation @xmath25    % \\ ] ] with the floquet states @xmath26 . the quasienergies @xmath24 are defined up to a multiple integer of @xmath27 , i.e. , the state @xmath28 is also an eigenstate of the floquet hamiltonian , but with the eigenvalue @xmath29 .",
    "this feature prevents us from a global ordering of the quasienergies which , however , can be achieved with the mean energies obtained after averaging over one driving period , i.e. , @xmath30 with the fourier components of the floquet states @xcite @xmath31",
    "the dynamics of the resonator in the regime of weak coupling to the bath can be efficiently described by a born - markovian master equation in the floquet picture @xcite for the elements @xmath32 of the reduced density operator @xmath33 after the harmonic bath has been traced out in the usual way . for weak damping ,",
    "the dissipative influence of the bath is relevant only on a time scale much larger than the driving period @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the time - dependent coefficients which are periodic in time with period @xmath35 can safely be replaced by their average over one driving period ( _ moderate rotating wave approximation _",
    "this yields a simplified master equation with time - independent coefficients which reads @xmath36 with @xmath37 the first term on the r.h.s",
    ".  describes the coherent time evolution of the pure system while the second term contains the transition rates describing the influence of the dissipative bath .",
    "it reads @xcite @xmath38 with the coefficients @xmath39 the operator @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ supop ] ) is a @xmath41matrix , when the total hilbert space of the anharmonic resonator has been truncated to the @xmath42dimensional subspace . for practical purposes",
    ", we set @xmath43 throughout this work .",
    "note that we have confirmed convergence with respect to @xmath44 for all results shown below . with that",
    ", @xmath40 can be readily diagonalized numerically by standard means .",
    "this can be formalized in terms of the diagonalization transformation @xmath45 by the eigenvalue equation @xmath46 here , @xmath47 denote the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath40 . since the master equation ( [ floqme ] )",
    "conserves the trace of @xmath33 , there is an eigenvalue @xmath48 which characterizes the stationary solution @xmath49 .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues all have a negative real part leading to a decay of the corresponding mode with time .",
    "due to the structure of the master equation ( [ floqme ] ) , there exist two classes of eigenvalues : ( i ) the first class having an imaginary part of zero consists of individual eigenvalues ( associated to _ relaxation _ ) , and ( ii ) the second class having non - zero imaginary parts ( associated to _ dephasing _ ) consists of pairs of complex conjugated eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvalues can be ordered according to the size of the absolute value of their real parts .",
    "as it turns out , there is one pair of complex conjugated eigenvalues , i.e. , @xmath50 with the smallest non - zero absolute value of the real part .",
    "moreover , we find that that pair of eigenvalues is clearly separated in size from the remaining ones with respect to the real parts indicating a separation of time scales .",
    "that pair of eigenvalues is responsible for the tunneling dynamics at long times , as will be discussed in section [ restun ] .",
    "finally , the solution of the master equation ( [ floqme ] ) can be formally written as @xmath51 for convenience , we have chosen the initial time @xmath52 .",
    "we are interested in calculating the asymptotic expectation value @xmath53 of the position operator .",
    "this is the quantity which can directly be compared to its classical counterpart being the solution of the classical duffing equation .",
    "it reads @xmath54 with the coefficients @xmath55 since the oscillator is driven by a cosine - shaped external force , it will oscillate in the asymptotic limit also with a phase - shifted cosine if the excitation frequency @xmath0 remains close to @xmath6 .",
    "higher harmonics could be generated in this nonlinear system but they are not in the focus of our interest in this work .",
    "thus , only the terms @xmath56 contribute in the fourier expansion and we obtain @xmath57 with the amplitude @xmath58 and the phase @xmath59 of the first harmonic of the fourier expansion .",
    "these two quantities are used to study the nonlinear response of the anharmonic resonator in the stationary long - time limit .",
    "the short time dynamics of such a type of master equation is an interesting issue by itself since it is related to the question of complete positivity and to the question of factorizing initial conditions @xcite .",
    "moreover , we note that the master equation ( [ floqme ] ) is valid only in the case of weak system - bath coupling . for the opposite limit of strong coupling ( quantum smoluchowski limit ) , different techniques @xcite have to be applied .",
    "the corresponding classical oscillator ( at zero temperature ) is the well - known duffing oscillator @xcite .",
    "it shows a rich variety of features including regular and chaotic motion . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the parameter regime where only regular motion occurs .",
    "the nonlinear response of its amplitude @xmath1 can be calculated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "one obtains the response @xmath2 as the solution of the equation @xmath60 its characteristic form is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] . for weak driving strengths , the response as a function of the driving frequency @xmath0 has the well - known form of the harmonic oscillator with the maximum at @xmath61 . for increasing driving strength , the resonance grows and bends away from the @xmath61-axis towards larger frequencies ( since @xmath8 ) .",
    "the locus of the maximal amplitudes is given by the parabola @xcite @xmath62 , which is often called the _",
    "backbone curve_. most importantly , a bistability develops with two adjacent stable branches and one intermediate unstable branch .",
    "this bistability is connected with a hysteretical jump phenomenon which can be probed if the driving frequency @xmath0 is adiabatically increased or decreased .",
    "the hysteresis is maximal for zero temperature . at finite temperature ,",
    "it is reduced since the particle can escape from the metastable local minimum to the adjacent global minimum via thermal hopping @xcite before the deterministic switching point is reached @xcite .",
    "note that for stronger driving amplitudes , also bifurcations and period doublings can occur @xcite which we do not address in the present work .",
    "the nonlinear response of the phase @xmath3 can be determined perturbatively in a similar way .",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath1 is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) .",
    "the curve @xmath64 also has two stable branches with an unstable intermediate branch and displays similar hysteretical jump phenomena as the amplitude response .",
    "as we will show in the following , the nonlinear response is qualitatively different in the corresponding quantum system .",
    "the discrete quasi - energy spectrum allows for multi - photon excitations which yield discrete resonances in the amplitude response profile .",
    "moreover , the dynamically generated bistability allows for an escape of the system out of the metastable state via resonant quantum tunneling .",
    "this generates characteristic resonances in the tunneling rate when the external frequency @xmath0 , which plays the role of a control parameter , is tuned .",
    "a typical response profile for the amplitude @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] .",
    "the shoulder - like shape is a remnant of the classical form of the response which is indicated by the dashed line . in the quantum case ,",
    "clear resonances can be observed at particular values of the driving frequency .",
    "the resonances can be understood as discrete multi - photon transitions occurring when the @xmath65-th multiple of the field quantum @xmath27 equals the corresponding energy gap in the anharmonic oscillator . by inspection of the associated quasienergy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , one can see that the distinct resonances occur at multiple degenerate avoided level crossings of the quasienergy level @xmath66 of the @xmath65-th floquet state with the quasienergy level @xmath67 of the floquet groundstate . in physical terms , multi - photon excitations occur in the resonator and the corresponding populated floquet state dominates then the position expectation value @xmath68 with its large value of the amplitude , see eqs .",
    "( [ xampl],[xcoeff ] ) .",
    "the width of the @xmath65-th resonance is determined by the minimal splitting at the avoided quasienergy level crossing which is equal to the @xmath65-photon rabi frequency .",
    "the latter can be evaluated perturbatively for weak driving amplitudes @xcite upon applying a rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) . for the resulting hamiltonian",
    ", one finds that to lowest order in @xmath69 , the @xmath65-photon rabi frequency at @xmath70 decreases exponentially with @xmath65 implying that the resonances are sharper for larger @xmath65 . for small frequencies ,",
    "the broad peaks overlap strongly and lead to a shoulder - like profile which is similar to the classical result ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "although the rwa yields a qualitatively correct picture , a quantitative comparison shows noticeable deviations from the results for the full anharmonic resonator and is not pursued further in this work . note that a similar system has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a dispersive optical bistability . there",
    ", a nonlinear hamiltonian has been derived from the duffing oscillator using a rwa , similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite . a rather involved matrix continued - fraction method also revealed a bistability .",
    "however , the numerical procedure to obtain those results is rather cumbersome .",
    "in contrast , our approach is numerically straightforward since it only involves a simple numerical diagonalization of a matrix .      since the location of the multi - photon resonances is determined by the system hamiltonian , it is interesting to see how they depend on varying the system parameters @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum of the system and therefore , the floquet spectrum , depends strongly on the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath7 . increasing @xmath7 increases the energy gaps between the succeeding eigenstates .",
    "thus , the multiphoton absorption processes occur at larger frequencies of the driving field .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath7 leads in general to a shift of the response curve @xmath2 towards larger frequencies @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we observe that the height of the @xmath65-photon peak decreases for increasing @xmath7 .",
    "this observation is qualitatively in agreement with a perturbative treatment for weak driving within a rotating wave approximation @xcite .",
    "the floquet spectrum of the uncoupled system depends on the value of the driving amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "a perturbative analysis @xcite shows that the @xmath65-photon rabi frequency @xmath71 which is given by the minimal splitting of the quasienergy at the avoided quasienergy level crossing depends crucially on @xmath65 and @xmath9 .",
    "this , in turn , determines the behavior of the @xmath65-photon resonance .",
    "the detailed results of the dependence on the @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.adriv ] .",
    "the @xmath72-photon peak grows for growing @xmath9 .",
    "most interestingly , the @xmath73-photon peak displays a nontrivial behavior . for weak",
    "driving , a @xmath74-photon antiresonance , i.e. , a dip , develops .",
    "when the field amplitude is increased the antiresonance turns into a true resonance which grows further for growing @xmath9 .",
    "the particular dependence of the local extrema are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.adriv ] . as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ xampl ] ) and ( [ xcoeff ] ) , the amplitude @xmath1 is determined by the sum @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the product of the weights @xmath49 ( which also contains the influence of the bath ) and the matrix elements @xmath76 ( which is a property of the coherent driven system alone ) determines the full shape of the amplitude .",
    "notice that @xmath49 is in general not diagonal .",
    "this is different from the system considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where only a coherent system without bath has been investigated .    by varying the system parameters ,",
    "we have modified implicitly both @xmath49 and @xmath76 . in the following section , only bath parameters and",
    "thus @xmath49 will be modified , leaving @xmath76 unchanged .",
    "the crossover from antiresonant to resonant behavior occurs when an increased driving amplitude @xmath9 increases the population of higher - lying floquet states . in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the role of the dissipative environment by tuning the bath temperature and the damping constant .",
    "since increasing temperature @xmath77 leads also to an increased population of other floquet modes , the transition from antiresonant to resonant behavior can also be expected to occur for growing @xmath77 , at least in a certain temperature regime .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.atemp ] for the 5-photon and 6-photon - resonance .",
    "the resonant peak for @xmath72 grows and broadens if temperature is increased .",
    "in contrast , the antiresonant dip for @xmath73 shrinks for growing @xmath77 and turns into a resonant peak . this peculiar behavior can be interpreted as thermally assisted cross - over from antiresonant to resonant behavior .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig.atemp ] shows the local extrema for @xmath72 and @xmath73 . for even larger temperature @xmath78 ,",
    "the characteristic peak structure is completely smeared out due to thermal broadening , see also fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , lower panel .",
    "then , the peaks overlap and the dynamic bistability is smeared out by thermal transitions between the two ( meta-)stable states .",
    "the results for different damping constants @xmath13 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.adamp ] .",
    "the five - photon resonance decreases when @xmath13 is increased from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . as also shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.adamp ] , the peak maximum decreases monotonously for @xmath72 .",
    "for the six - photon ( anti-)resonance , we find a different behavior . for weak damping ,",
    "a sharp resonance occurs which is turned into an antiresonance for larger damping .",
    "the non - monotonous dependence of the six - photon resonance is also shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.adamp ] .",
    "as it is the case for very large temperature ( see above ) , the influence of a strong coupling to the bath gradually smears out and finally destroys the resonances .",
    "next , we address the nonlinear response of the phase @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding classical duffing oscillator shows an interesting nonlinear phase response @xmath64 including two stable branches @xcite .",
    "the characteristic multi - photon transitions in the quantum version of the duffing oscillator also shows up in the phase response profile .",
    "the results for different driving strengths @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.phidriv ] for the regime where the five- and six - photon transition occur . for @xmath81 a phase shift @xmath82 is found . for @xmath83 , the phase shift vanishes , @xmath84 . in the intermediate region @xmath85 ,",
    "the multi - photon resonances induce also an antiresonance in the phase shift . the five - photon antiresonance is enhanced and broadened if the driving strength @xmath9 is increased from @xmath86 to @xmath87 . increasing the driving further to @xmath88 wipes out the antiresonance completely and the transition @xmath82 to @xmath84",
    "is shifted to larger values of @xmath0 , where this development is repeated at the succeeding six - photon resonance .",
    "this behavior is also found when temperature is varied , see fig .",
    "[ fig.phitemp ] .",
    "increasing @xmath77 leads to a suppression of the transition of the phase shift @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , increasing damping favors this transition at lower frequencies @xmath0 , see fig .",
    "[ fig.phidamp ] .",
    "the dynamic bistability of the steady state of the classical duffing oscillator does not survive in the quantum system .",
    "the reason is that the system will escape the metastable state asymptotically via tunneling , similar to the case of the driven double - well potential @xcite .",
    "note also that , as a consequence , the hysteretical behavior is suppressed if the control parameter @xmath0 is varied truly adiabatically .    nevertheless , signatures of the dynamic bistability and tunneling can be found if we consider how the steady state is reached .",
    "for this , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig.timeresolv ] the time evolution of the amplitude @xmath1 ( local maxima of the vibrations ) starting with the ground state of the undriven oscillator as the initial state .",
    "we observe fast oscillations at short times .",
    "they decay on a time scale @xmath90 which reflects `` intrawell '' relaxation in the metastable state .",
    "then , starting from a metastable state at intermediate times , a slow exponential decay towards the asymptotically globally stable state can be observed .",
    "this separation of time scales is a clear indication of tunneling from the meta- to the globally stable in the dynamic bistability .",
    "the decay rate @xmath91 for this slow process ( tunneling rate ) is determined by the absolute value of the real part of the eigenvalue @xmath92 of the operator @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ supop ] ) , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "results for the tunneling rate as function of the control parameter @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.restun ] for two different damping constants @xmath13 .",
    "most importantly , the tunneling rate shows resonances at the same values of the frequencies where the avoided crossings of the quasienergy levels occur ( see dashed vertical lines ) .",
    "the peaks in @xmath91 indicate resonant tunneling @xcite from the meta- to the globally stable state both of which are dynamically induced .",
    "note the analogy to resonant tunneling in a static double - well potential @xcite .",
    "the role of the eigenenergies in the static case is now played by the quasienergies @xmath24 determining the coherent dynamics , see eq .   ( [ floqme ] ) . in both cases , the avoided ( quasi-)energy level crossings are the origin of resonant tunneling .",
    "nevertheless , the incoherent part of eq .",
    "( [ floqme ] ) is crucial to observe the resonant tunneling in this driving induced bistability .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that the resonant tunneling is enhanced if the coupling to the bath is increased from @xmath79 to @xmath94 ( bath assisted resonant tunneling ) .",
    "we have also calculated the dependence of this phenomenon on temperature but we found a weak dependence in the interesting low - temperature regime ( not shown ) .",
    "the quantum duffing oscillator is a generic theoretical model which finds several applications in experimental systems .",
    "for instance , a suspended nanomechanical beam @xcite which is excited to transverse vibrations behaves as a damped anharmonic resonator .",
    "several experimental groups have observed the behavior described by the _",
    "classical _ duffing oscillator @xcite .",
    "the transition to the quantum regime is currently in the focus of intense research @xcite .",
    "once , such kind of truly quantum-mechanical systems on the nanoscale have been shown to exist , macroscopic quantum effects @xcite should be readily observable .",
    "a second class of experimental systems addresses the resonant non - destructive read - out of a persistent current qubit @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional switching current measurement that generates unwanted quasi - particles when the dc - squid ( acting as the qubit detector ) switches to the voltage state , this technique keeps the squid biased along the supercurrent branch during the measurement .",
    "thereby , the josephson plasma resonance of the squid depends on the inductive coupling of the squid to the qubit . measuring the plasma resonance allows to non - destructively read out the qubit state .",
    "the application of this read - out technique in the nonlinear regime of the squid could allow for an improved sensitivity as well as its potential use as a nonlinear amplifier .",
    "finally , we note that there exists a wide parameter regime ( typically strong driving and/or big nonlinearities ) where a quantum chaotic behavior of the system with many interesting features can occur @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of this regime goes beyond the scope of this work .    to summarize",
    ", we have investigated the nonlinear response of the amplitude as well as of the phase of the oscillations of a driven damped anharmonic resonator ( quantum duffing oscillator ) .",
    "the use of an efficient floquet - born - markovian master equation allows to determine the stationary long - time solution directly via straightforward diagonalization of the rate matrix .",
    "this allows to study the amplitude as well as the phase response for a wide range of parameters .",
    "most importantly , we find pronounced resonances as well as antiresonances which are associated to multi - photon transitions in the resonator .",
    "we have found an interesting non - monotonous behavior of the antiresonance including a cross - over to a true resonant peak .",
    "this cross - over can be enhanced by the presence of the bath but is already inherent in the underlying coherent driven quantum system .",
    "furthermore , we have found a clear separation of time scales in the dynamics _ how _ the globally stable state is approached starting from the metastable state .",
    "this tunneling process can be characterized by a single tunneling rate @xmath91 which follows straightforwardly as the smallest non - zero eigenvalue of the rate matrix .",
