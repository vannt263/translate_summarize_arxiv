    "one of the most fundamental quests of high - energy physics is the determination of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter . at high densities and/or temperatures",
    "the quarks are expected to be liberated from their confinement within hadrons and a new phase of matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , to be formed . in order to explore this new phase of matter ,",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been constructed at brookhaven national laboratory , to collide au + au nuclei at @xmath1 agev center of mass energy .",
    "one of the new features of rhic physics will be the production of 600 - 1200 charged pions per unit rapidity . due to this reason , the phenix and star detectors will be able to determine not only single particle spectra and the two - particle bose - einstein correlations , but also the higher - order bose - einstein correlation functions , which turn out to be essential in order to distinguish fully chaotic and partially coherent particle sources from each other  @xcite .",
    "as partial coherence is a fundamental aspect of quantum fields , and it can be related to a possible bose - einstein condensation of pion wave - packets to the wave - packet with the smallest energy in the rest frame of the source  @xcite , the determination of the higher - order bose - einstein correlation functions at rhic is of great theoretical interest  @xcite , as well as a great experimental challenge .",
    "however , coulomb ( and possibly strong ) final state interactions of pions play an important rle in shaping the final multi - particle bose - einstein correlation functions .",
    "as no consistent and systematic treatment of the final state interaction of a charged multi - boson system is available in the literature , the experimental removal of the coulomb effects from the @xmath0-particle bose - einstein correlation functions is based hitherto only on some ad - hoc generalization of the gamow formula to the multi - particle case .    in the present letter",
    "we propose a straight - forward method for a _",
    "systematic _ quantum - mechanical treatment of coulomb final state interactions in higher - order bose - einstein correlation functions .",
    "although the validity of the method , described below , is limited to a certain , albeit large kinematic domain @xmath2 , due to the fact that the exact solution of even the 3-body coulomb scattering problem is beyond presently available means , we think that the results presented here represent a first important step towards establishing a link between few - body physics and bose - einstein correlations in high - energy multi - particle physics .",
    "especially , the new coulomb wave - function corrections indicate that the generalized gamow correction method would make a factor of two error in the 5-th order bose - einstein correlation functions , if the radius parameters were in the 5 - 10 fm range , as characteristic for heavy ion collisions .",
    "if the characteristic radius parameters were as small as 1 fm , the characteristic size in reactions of high - energy particle physics , the generalized gamow factors would be acceptable , at a 10 % level of precision in the 5-th order bose - einstein correlation functions .",
    "the strength of higher - order correlation functions increases much slower for partially coherent particle sources than for incoherent sources with an unresolvable halo of long - lived resonances  @xcite .",
    "even if the strength of the second- and third - order bose - einstein correlations were similar in a partially coherent and another incoherent particle source , the strength of the 5-th order correlation functions would be a factor of 2 different between the partially coherent and the fully chaotic cases  @xcite . in order to distinguish these scenarios ,",
    "the coulomb final state interactions must be corrected for , and the error on the coulomb correction must be kept under control .    in a recent letter , we have presented a refined treatment of the 3-body coulomb correction problem  @xcite , with application to new high - energy heavy - ion data by the na44 experiment  @xcite . in this work , we generalize this 3-body coulomb wave function integration method to the case of @xmath0-particle coulomb corrections .",
    "let us summarize some basic properties of the bose - einstein @xmath0-particle correlation functions using only the generic aspects of their derivation , and establish a link between the theory of final state interactions in few body physics and the theory of bose - einstein correlations in high - energy particle and nuclear physics .",

    "it is quite remarkable that this complicated object , that carries quantum mechanical information on the phase - space distribution of particle production as well as on possible partial coherence of the source , can be expressed in a relatively simple , straight - forward manner both in the analytically solvable pion - laser model of refs .",

    ", the derivation is based on the assumptions that ( i ) the bosons are emitted from a semi - classical source , where currents are strong enough so that the recoils due to radiation can be neglected , ( ii ) the particle sources are an incoherent random ensemble of such currents , described by a boost - invariant formulation  @xcite , and ( iii ) that the particles propagate as free plane waves after production . however , a formally similar result is obtained when particle production happens in a correlated manner , and even final state interactions between the produced particles are allowed for , generalizing the results of refs .",

    "( [ e : bas1],[e : bas ] ) will form the basis for evaluation of the coulomb and strong final state interaction effects on the observables .",
    "on this level , all the correlations are build up from correlations of pairs of particles .",

    "note also that a similar result can be obtained in the semi - classical boosted - current formalism , where the particle production has negligible effect on the elementary source of pion production ( bremsstrahlung - like radiation ) .",
    "let us point out that the exact solution of multi - particle bose - einstein symmetrization in the pion laser model resulted in a poisson cluster picture  @xcite .",
    "this implies that in the rare gas limit , without coulomb or other final state interactions , the multi - boson correlations appear only as random admixture of a small amount of correlated pairs to independently distributed single particles . as the density increases , also",
    "the fraction of correlated pairs increases and the admixture of independently distributed clusters of particle triplets , quartets , and higher - order @xmath0-tuples becomes correspondingly more important .",
    "the result of refs .",
    "@xcite indicates that below the onset of bose - einstein condensation , a fully symmetrized multi - boson system can be considered as a convolution of independently distributed clusters of particle @xmath0-tuples , and it is natural to apply coulomb corrections within such clusters of particles only .",
    "we shall also discuss that , when one of the particles becomes separated from its cluster , the relevant @xmath0-particle coulomb correction factor will reduce to the coulomb correction factor of a smaller cluster that contains the remaining @xmath21 particles .",
    "in order to treat correctly the coulomb corrections to the @xmath0-particle correlation function , knowledge of the @xmath0-body coulomb scattering wave function is required .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case that the transverse momenta of all the particles in the final state in their center of mass are small enough to make a nonrelativistic approach sensible .",
    "hence the problem consists in finding the solution of the @xmath0-charged particle schrdinger equation when all @xmath0 particles are in the continuum .",

    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the coordinate and momentum ( three-)vectors , respectively , of particle @xmath8 . from these we construct in the usual manner the relative coordinate @xmath27 and the relative momentum @xmath28 between particles @xmath8 and @xmath29 , the corresponding reduced mass being @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath0-particle schrdinger equation reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total kinetic energy for @xmath0 particles in the continuum .",
    "@xmath33 is the free hamilton operator and @xmath34 the interaction potential between particles @xmath8 and @xmath29 , consisting of a strong but short - range ( @xmath35 ) plus the long - range coulomb interaction ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "equation ( [ nse ] ) has to be complemented by the complete set of boundary conditions in order that a unique solution be obtained .",
    "already for @xmath37 , the exact numerical solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ nse ] ) for @xmath38 is beyond present means , partly for principal and partly for practical reasons . for a brief discussion of the related difficulties",
    "see @xcite .",
    "but , at least the complete set of boundary conditions to be imposed is nowadays known analytically @xcite , in the form of the explicit solutions of the schrdinger equation in all asymptotic regions of the three - particle configuration space . apart from the trivial two - cluster region relevant for an asymptotic configuration containing only two particles",
    "one of which is a bound state of two particles , the asymptotic solution takes its simplest form in the asymptotic region conventionally denoted by @xmath39 and characterized by the fact that - roughly speaking - all three interparticle distances become uniformly large , i.e.  all @xmath40 ( for a precise definition of the various asymptotic regions see @xcite ) .",
    "there exist three more asymptotic regions @xmath41 which are pertinent to situations characterized by final state interactions between particles @xmath8 and @xmath29 .",
    "but the appropriate asymptotic solutions are rather more complicated . from the physical point of view the union of all these regions",
    "@xmath42 is relevant for the complete breakup into three free particles . as has been shown in @xcite , in spite of the lack of an exact solution of the three - body schrdinger equation in the whole three - body configuration space , already knowledge of the asymptotic solution in @xmath39 led to a systematic , well controlled extraction of coulomb effects in the three - particle bose - einstein correlation measurements , in contrast to earlier , ad - hoc 3-body coulomb correction methods .    in the final states of heavy - ion reactions , where a large number of charged particle tracks appear ,",
    "the mutual , macroscopically large separation of tracks is one of the criteria of a clean measurement .",
    "this suggests that in order to study @xmath0-body correlation functions , again knowledge of the wave function in @xmath43 , the region in @xmath0-particle configuration space where all interparticle distances become uniformly large , i.e. , @xmath44 for all values of @xmath45 , may be sufficient . here",
    ", uniform divergence of interparticle distances in @xmath43 means roughly that @xmath46 for asymptotically large times for any two arbitrarily chosen particle pairs , although the interparticle distances themselves diverge for any pair .",
    "one immediate consequence of this definition is that in @xmath43 the short - range interaction parts @xmath35 play no rle any longer and can thus be neglected .    for want of an exact @xmath0-particle coulomb scattering wave function an approximate solution of eq .",
    "( [ nse ] ) is sought . for this purpose ,",
    "let us introduce the continuum solution of the two - body coulomb schrdinger equation as @xmath47 describing the relative motion of the two particles @xmath8 and @xmath29 with energy @xmath48 .",
    "the explicit solution is @xmath49 , \\label{2pwfn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the appropriate coulomb parameter . @xmath52 $ ] is the confluent hypergeometric function and @xmath53 the gamma function . with it the following ansatz for an approximate @xmath0-particle coulomb wave function",
    "is made @xmath54    this ansatz can be justified by the following arguments .",
    "+ ( i ) the wave function ( [ aswn ] ) is asymptotically correct in the asymptotic region @xmath55 ; that is , it is the leading term if all interparticle separations go to infinity , of the ( unknown ) exact solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ nse ] ) @xcite . of course , for non - asymptotic particle separations it represents a theoretically not compulsory though plausible extrapolation .",
    "+ ( ii ) in the formal , time - dependent scattering theory the basic object is the mller operator which maps the free @xmath0-particle state onto the corresponding scattering state . the mathematically rigorous definition of the @xmath0-charged particle mller operator @xcite requires , in contrast to the case of purely short - range interactions between the particles , the introduction of a ` renormalization factor ' .",
    "the latter has the form of a product of @xmath56 renormalization factors each of which is appropriate for the definition of the mller operator for one of the possible pairings of the charged particles . obviously , the ansatz ( [ aswn ] ) of the @xmath0-particle wave function is consistent with this renormalization prescription .",
    "+ ( iii ) by suitably decomposing the ( stationary ) mller operator of an @xmath0-body system into a chain of mller operators of subsystems with fewer interacting particles , a wave function of the type ( [ aswn ] ) has been suggested as a lowest - order term of an @xmath0-particle coulomb wave function in @xcite to be used in all of configuration space .",
    "the assumptions entering were neglect of genuine higher - than - two particle correlations in the wave function , which is justified in @xmath55 , and restriction of all two - particle scatterings onto their respective energy shells .",
    "+ ( iv ) the wave function ( [ aswn ] ) coincides for any selected particle triplet with the form pertinent to the given pre - selected triplet , if the corresponding interparticle distances diverge @xcite .",
    "+ ( v ) for @xmath57 , such an approximate wave function has been proposed in refs .",
    "although it ceases to be solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ nse ] ) for non - asymptotic values of the relative coordinates , it is nevertheless widely used , with considerable success , to calculate cross sections for the ionisation of hydrogen atoms by ( energetic ) electron impact .",
    "the foregoing discussion makes it clear that the ansatz ( [ aswn ] ) is justifiable only for sufficiently large interparticle separations , a condition which is not easily translated into an experimentally accessible criterion .",
    "however , for @xmath57 such a criterion has been established , namely that the total kinetic energy @xmath58 of three particles of unit charge be at least @xmath59 which equals @xmath60 mev for a typical source size @xmath61 fm @xcite . thus , assuming also for an arbitrary number @xmath0 of particles ( again for simplicity taken to have unit charge ) the total kinetic energy @xmath62 to be equally distributed over the relative kinetic energies between each pair , the latter criterion generalises to the condition @xmath63 mev .",
    "hence , for the following we _ assume _ the @xmath0-particle coulomb wave function to be given everywhere as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an undetermined overall normalization constant .",
    "this is the building block for a properly symmetrized @xmath0-body wave function where the bosonic or fermionic nature of any subset of identical particles has to be taken into account in the symmetrization ( or anti - symmetrization ) process in the standard manner @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we present explicitly the fully symmetrized wave function only for the case of @xmath0 identical charged bosons , as to our knowledge measurements in high - energy physics attempting to reveal the strength of the multi - particle bose - einstein correlation effects@xcite exist only for this special case .",
    "the fully symmetrized @xmath0-particle wave function has the form @xmath66 where @xmath5 stands for the set of permutations of @xmath0 different indices , and @xmath67 for the permuted value of the index @xmath8 in one of the permutations belonging to the set @xmath5 . using the ansatz ( [ aswn1 ] )",
    ", the above equation simplifies as @xmath68 which contains only the two - body relative coulomb wave functions .",
    "the physics of the above ansatz is very simple : if all @xmath0 final charges emerge into the continuum and if all are well separated from the other tracks , only the pairwise coulomb relative wave functions play a rle . however , relative coulomb wave functions have to be taken into account for all possible particle pairs as the coulomb interaction is of long range .",
    "graphically , if we represent the @xmath0 particles by @xmath0 crosses , the relative coulomb wave function between particle @xmath8 and @xmath29 can be represented by a line connecting cross @xmath8 with cross @xmath29 , and the full , asymptotically correct @xmath0-particle coulomb wave function is represented by connecting each of the @xmath0 crosses with the @xmath21 others by forming a polygon with @xmath0 corners and @xmath69 lines ( diagonals and edges ) .",
    "one can apply a simple approximation to ( [ wfsym ] ) which preserves at least some features of the coulomb distortion effects .",
    "it consists in neglecting , for any two - particle coulomb wave function @xmath70 , the hypergeometric function in the exact solution ( [ 2pwfn ] ) and retaining only the part @xmath71 . after evaluating the double sums over all permutations of @xmath72 in a product ,",
    "one finds @xmath73 in the last line , the symmetrized @xmath0-particle wave function for neutral particles @xmath74 with its own normalization constant @xmath75 has been introduced . as usual",
    ", @xmath76 is the gamov penetration factor for the particle pair @xmath45 .",
    "it , thus , follows that the proper generalization of the gamow penetration factor for @xmath0 charged particles reads as @xmath77 this expression contains @xmath78 factors , corresponding to all possible pairings @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , it is self - consistent : if the momenta @xmath79 of @xmath80 particles approach infinity such that for no two momenta @xmath81 and @xmath82 the corresponding relative momentum remains finite , we have @xmath83 where the remaining @xmath84 particles whose momenta remain finite are denoted symbolically by @xmath85 .",
    "specifically , @xmath86 an explicit check for @xmath87 shows that , indeed , @xmath88 hence , the generalization ( [ gn ] ) of the gamow correction factor to arbitrary values of @xmath0 is done in a self - consistent manner that satisfies its physically expected reduction property .",
    "this result was substantiated for the case of @xmath0 identical charged bosons . in general",
    ", the final state of a high - energy heavy - ion reaction contains many different kind of particles , with different charges and quantum statistical properties . nevertheless , the ansatz given in eq .",
    "( [ aswn1 ] ) can be utilized for any values of the charges , and the result can be symmetrized for a generic mixture of particles as prescribed in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us add two comments :    \\(i ) as mentioned above , a wave function of the type ( [ aswn ] ) implies that the relative motion of each of the pairs of particles is independent of that of the other pairs , i.e. , that no correlations between the motions of the particle pairs occur . in other words ,",
    "the proposed form of the factorized @xmath0-particle coulomb wave function does not include genuine higher - order correlations , only those that can be built up from two - particle coulomb correlations .",
    "this is the same level of approximation that is used to derive eq .",
    "( [ e : m2 ] ) , the generic form of the @xmath0-particle bose - einstein correlation functions . results of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that eq .",
    "( [ e : m2 ] ) is valid only if the density of bosons is below the limit of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "\\(ii ) it should be kept in mind that the extrapolation out of the region @xmath43 implied by ( [ aswn ] ) is highly non - unique .",
    "even for the 3-body coulomb problem , various different wave functions which , of course , coincide asymptotically in @xmath89 with ( [ aswn ] ) have been , and are still being , developed .",
    "the correlation function measuring the enhanced probability for emission of @xmath0 identical bose particles is given by eq .",
    "this correlation function is usually , due to meager statistics , only measured as a function of the lorentz invariant @xmath90 , defined by the relation @xmath91 where @xmath92 , and where @xmath93 is the four - momentum of particle @xmath8 .",
    "we can now calculate the coulomb effects on the @xmath0-particle correlation function using @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the density distribution of the source for particle @xmath8 , taken as a gaussian distribution of width r in all three spatial directions .",
    "this formulation makes it possible to extract information on the source size @xmath96 , and to compare this value with that extracted by means of a generalized @xmath0-particle gamow approximation through @xmath97 . to this purpose",
    "we use the na44 data sample of three pion events produced in s - pb collisions at cern @xcite .",
    "we have calculated the coulomb correction factor , i.e.  @xmath98  @xcite , for source radius values @xmath99 1 , 5 , and 10 fm , for @xmath100 , 3 , 4 , and 5 particle correlations .",
    "the radii were chosen to be in the range of interest for high - energy particle and high - energy heavy - ion physics .",
    "the results are compared to the generalized gamow approximation .",
    "we have checked that in the limit @xmath101 the @xmath0-particle gamow approximation is indeed recovered numerically .    in case of a characteristic 1 fm effective source size , typical for bose - einstein correlation functions in various elementary particle reactions ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath0-particle gamow and coulomb wave function corrections were smaller than 10 % for @xmath102 and 5 particles , the @xmath0 = 5 case being shown in fig .",
    "1 . however , for future measurements of 5-particle bose - einstein correlations in particle physics that aim at a precision better than 5 percent relative error , coulomb wave function integration will be a necessity .",
    "for source sizes of 5 or 10 fm , that are the characteristic expectations for au + au reactions at rhic , the difference between the results of the gamow and coulomb wave function corrections increased dramatically , see figures 2 - 4 .",
    "we find that for a source radius of 5 fm , we need to take this detailed calculation into account already for the precise determination of the three - particle correlation function .",
    "however , with increasing number of particles , the deviation between the @xmath0-particle gamow and the @xmath0-particle coulomb wave function integration method increases drastically . for 5-particle coulomb correction , the better substantiated coulomb wave function integration method yields a factor of 2 deviation from the naive generalized gamow method .    at the end",
    "we note that systematic improvements of our treatment are possible by i ) including also effects of strong interactions between the particles of each pair , ii ) replacing the simple product of gaussians by a more realistic model for the production of particle @xmath0-tuples , and iii ) invoking improved @xmath0-body coulomb wave functions that are correct in a larger region of @xmath0-body configuration space than @xmath43 .",
    "however , corrections i ) and ii ) are estimated to be small , as 1 ) the final state coulomb interaction dominates over the final state strong interaction due to its long range and the relatively large source size , and 2 ) the effective source of particles is known to be approximately gaussian from detailed studies of two - pion correlations .",
    "correction iii ) is also expected to be small , as a clean measurement of particle @xmath0-tuples will likely require that these particles be in @xmath43 ; however , one has to wait till 4-th and 5-th order correlations are measured in heavy - ion collisions in order to determine the more detailed experimental conditions .",
    "on the basis of an explicit , analytically given form of the @xmath0-body coulomb wave function that is - at least asymptotically - correct in a large region of @xmath0-body configuration space , we have developed a new method to systematically correct for _ explicit _ many - body coulomb effects which is applicable to data analysis in a broad range of measurements in high - energy particle and heavy - ion physics .",
    "a generalized gamow correction factor has been established as a limiting case of vanishing source sizes .",
    "specifically , we have worked out our approach for 3 , 4 , and 5 identical charged particles and have tested it for gaussian source sizes with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and 10 fm .",
    "we have numerically found that the generalized gamow approximation is not reliable enough to determine the magnitude on the 5 % level of the five - body coulomb correction factor if @xmath103 fm , the characteristic lenght - scale of strong interactions in high - energy particle physics .",
    "the range of interest in high - energy heavy - ion physics was probed in the @xmath105 and 10 fm cases , and systematic errors , as large as 100 % , were shown to be generated with the earlier coulomb correction techniques for the correlation function of 5 particles .",

    "<S> the effect of multi - particle coulomb final state interactions on higher - order intensity correlations is determined in general , based on a scattering wave function which is solution of the @xmath0-body coulomb schrdinger equation in ( a large part of ) the asymptotic region of @xmath0-body configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we study coulomb effects on the @xmath0-particle bose - einstein correlation functions of similarly charged particles and remove a systematic error as big as 100 % from higher - order multi - particle bose - einstein correlation functions .    </S>",
