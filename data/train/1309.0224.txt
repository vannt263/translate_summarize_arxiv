    "this separation was missed in the previous calculations of the mass inflation phenomenon .",
    "the relative back - reaction corrections to the perturbed metric in the ( v , r)-frame and ( t , r)-frame at the finite distance from both the inner and outer apparent horizons , @xmath216 , appear to be of the order of small accretion rate , @xmath170 , which is a small dimensionless energy flux parameter .",
    "at the same tine , near and at the apparent horizons , at @xmath123 , the relative back - reaction corrections to the black hole metric are the largest , but still remain the small , of the order of @xmath217 .",
    "this means the absence of mass inflation phenomenon inside the charged black hole . additionally , it shown that a back reaction removes the infinite blue - shift singularity at the inner apparent horizon .",
    "there are a lot of limitations to the validity of the derived back - reaction corrections .",
    "the most vulnerable approximation is the slow accretion rate .",
    "it must be stressed also that semi - classical effects may influence the behavior of matter in the vicinity of the cauchy horizon .",
    "note also that the left patch of the carter - penrose diagram of the used eternal black hole geometry is absent in the general gravitational collapse .",
    "a further clarification of the mass inflation problem is required beyond the quasi - stationary limit , e.g. , by using the detailed numerical calculations with the large accretion rate .",
