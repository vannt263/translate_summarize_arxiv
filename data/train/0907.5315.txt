    "in recent years , remarkable effects in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems have been discovered in the presence of microwave ( mw ) illumination and a classically strong transverse magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "it has been observed that the magnetic - field dependence of the longitudinal resistance in a high - mobility 2d electron gas exhibits oscillations with a period determined by the ratio of the radiation frequency @xmath3 to the cyclotron frequency @xmath4=@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the effective mass of electrons @xcite .",
    "later experiments on the samples with ultrahigh mobility have shown that for a sufficiently high radiation power the resistance minima evolve into `` zero resistance states '' ( zrs ) , where dissipative resistance vanishes @xcite .",
    "both the zrs and the microwave induced resistance oscillations ( miros ) have attracted much theoretical interest , and several microscopic mechanisms responsible for these phenomena have been proposed .",
    "two of these mechanisms , widely discussed in literature , produce similar results concerning the miro periodicity and phase .",
    "the first , `` displacement '' mechanism , @xcite accounts for the displacement of electrons along the applied dc field under scattering - assisted microwave absorption .",
    "the second , `` inelastic '' mechanism , @xcite is associated with a microwave - generated nonequilibrium oscillatory component of the isotropic part of electron distribution function .",
    "the miros can also appear owing to the `` photovoltaic '' mechanism @xcite describing combined action of the microwave and dc fields on both temporal and angular harmonics of the distribution function . finally , it has been predicted that microwave excitation of the second angular harmonic of the distribution function , which is referred to as the `` quadrupole '' mechanism , @xcite should lead to an oscillatory contribution to the transverse ( hall ) resistivity . among these mechanisms ,",
    "the inelastic one is thought to play the dominant role in experiments at low temperatures @xmath7 and microwave powers , because its contribution is parametrically large in comparison to contributions of the other mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the inelastic mechanism overcomes the displacement one by a large factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the inelastic scattering time and quantum lifetime , respectively .",
    "it has been found that the inelastic mechanism satisfactory explains the power and temperature dependence of resistivity observed in earlier experiments and in more recent experiments both on single - subband @xcite and two - subband 2d systems @xcite .    with increasing microwave power , notable miro features associated with fractional ratios @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath1 are integers ,",
    "have been observed @xcite . while all the resonances described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) originate from commensurability of the cyclotron and microwave frequencies , the fractional miros ( fmiros ) corresponding to @xmath13 require multiphoton absorption processes which appear in the strongly nonlinear regime and can proceed in two ways .",
    "the first is a simultaneous absorption of several photons ( with virtual intermediate states ) @xcite and the second is a stepwise absorption of single photons @xcite .",
    "the latter process contributes to resistivity owing to incomplete relaxation of the electron system between the absorption events .",
    "the miro theories accounting for these processes @xcite demonstrate progressive appearance of the oscillation peaks with increasing fractional denominator @xmath1 as the microwave power increases , which is in agreement with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "the experiment @xcite shows the fmiro features up to @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in this paper we report the observation of oscillatory features which are likely attributed to higher - order ( up to @xmath16 ) fmiros .",
    "these oscillations are more pronounced at high temperatures ( @xmath17 6.5  k ) , when their observation is not hindered by the presence of shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations .",
    "we analyzed temperature , power and frequency dependencies of the magnetoresistance oscillations .",
    "for the microwave powers used in our experiment , the simultaneous absorption of more than two photons is found to be a rare event .",
    "therefore , a more plausible explanation for the high - order fmiros is the stepwise absorption of single photons @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism also fails to describe observation of high - order fractions because of energy conservation restrictions , when the gap between the landau levels exceeds the photon energy .",
    "moreover , we have found that the amplitude of fmiros for _ all _ fractions dramatically decreases at high microwave frequencies ( @xmath18  @xmath19  85  ghz ) .",
    "this behaviour qualitatively disagrees with the stepwise absorption model @xcite , which predicts that the threshold frequency strongly depends on the fractional value .",
    "we believe that this fmiro quenching effect is very similar to integer miro damping which occurs at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "the measurements have been performed in gaas quantum wells ( qws ) with well widths of 14  nm in the presence of microwave irradiation in the range from 32  ghz to 100  ghz with different intensities of radiation .",
    "in contrast to the previous studies @xcite with low electron density ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) and ultrahigh mobility ( @xmath22 @xmath23/v s ) , we use high - density samples from different wafers with moderate mobilities @xmath24 @xmath23/v s. all the data presented below are for a sample with a carrier concentration of @xmath25  @xmath21 and a mobility of @xmath26 @xmath23/v s. the sample was mounted in a vti cryostat with a waveguide to deliver radiation down to the sample . the resistance @xmath27",

    "the miro peaks @xmath31 survive up to 10  k. for low frequencies ( @xmath32 ghz ) , the cr peak amplitude starts to decrease rapidly and vanishes for 35  ghz .",

    "the fractional oscillations near @xmath34  = 1/2 and 3/2 observed in previous publications in principle can be explained by the two - photon process @xcite .",

    "fmiro due to the process of stepwise absorption of the several photons seems to be more suitable . within the framework of this model @xcite ,",
    "the intensity of the fractional resonances with denominator @xmath1 is proportional to the @xmath1-th power of the squared dingle factor , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "this explains why the fractional features are absent for the low - field side of the cyclotron resonance ( the disappearance of integer miro and a rapid decrease of the cr peak amplitude with lowering mw frequency is of the same origin ) .",
    "however , it should be also expected that fmiros damp exponentially faster than the integer oscillations due to a decrease of the quantum lifetime with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we observe that the fmiro features weaken and eventually dissappear at the same temperature as the integer miro features . it may be argued that this difference is not essential after a transition from overlapped to separated landau levels , where @xmath50 is of the order unity , and many oscillatory harmonics contribute into the density of states .",

    "the fmiro in our theoretical calculations appear below this threshold , while at the border @xmath71 the magnetoresistance plots have bump - like features clearly visible at high mw power and shown by broad arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",

    "( 3 ) , especially those for 45 and 55  ghz which occur roughly at the same magnetic field . on the other side ,",
    "the fmiro with @xmath72 is allowed at frequencies above 85 ghz , which also disagrees with our observations .",
    "it is worth noting that recently it has been demonstrated in experiments that the integer miros are quenched at frequencies above 200 ghz , and practically disappear at higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "note that in ref .",
    "@xcite the mobility is two times higher than in ref . @xcite which causes the miro observation at 240  ghz .",
    "the microscopic mechanism of this quenching effect is still unclear .",
    "we believe that a common theoretical approach to explain the damping effect of both fractional and integer miros is necessary .",
    "in summary , we observe fractional miros with ratios @xmath73 in a high density two - dimensional electron system for different frequencies and relatively high temperatures when sdh oscillations are suppressed .",
    "fractional miros have a similar temperature dependence to integer miro , which may indicate that fmiros are dominated by the inelastic mechanism under multiphoton absorption .",
    "the transition to sublinear power dependence of fmiro amplitude with increasing microwave power , which we attribute to saturation effect , is another argument in favour of the inelastic mechanism @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed two competing models for fmiro , a simultaneous multiphoton absorption and a stepwise absorption of several photons , in application to our data .",
    "the multiphoton model fails to explain the high - order fractional features because the microwave power is not sufficient to generate such multiphoton processes . concerning the stepwise absorption model , both the existence of high - order fmiro in the absence of single - photon transitions between landau levels and the independence of the threshold frequency for fmiro quenching of the number of fraction disagree with the predictions of this model .",
    "therefore we believe that the high - order fractional features require another explanation .",
    "more experimental work and theoretical effort has to be done in order to obtain a complete understanding of this fmiro phenomenon .",
