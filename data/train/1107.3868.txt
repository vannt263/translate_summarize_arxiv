    "likewise , an extension of the molecular model to describe @xmath191 will also provide further insight into the interactions between the nucleus and the bound electrons .",
    "the electronic component of the electric hyperfine interaction @xmath159 can be written as a sum of products of orbital electronic and nuclear tensor operators .",
    "analogous to the interaction of the ground state spin with electric and strain fields , at zero - order in the spin coupling coefficients only the terms of @xmath159 that contain @xmath26 orbital electronic tensor operators will have non - zero matrix elements , and these matrix elements will be diagonal and identical for each spin state .",
    "the symmetry of the lattice ensures that only similar terms from the lattice electron and internuclear contribution are also non - zero .",

    "<S> the ground state spin of the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy center in diamond has been the platform for the recent rapid expansion of new frontiers in quantum metrology and solid state quantum information processing . in ambient conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the spin has been demonstrated to be a high precision magnetic and electric field sensor as well as a solid state qubit capable of coupling with nearby nuclear and electronic spins . </S>",
    "<S> however , in spite of its many outstanding demonstrations , the theory of the spin has not yet been fully developed and there does not currently exist thorough explanations for many of its properties , such as the anisotropy of the electron g - factor and the existence of stark effects and strain splittings . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> the theory of the ground state spin is fully developed for the first time using the molecular orbital theory of the center in order to provide detailed explanations for the spin s fine and hyperfine structures and its interactions with electric , magnetic and strain fields . </S>"
