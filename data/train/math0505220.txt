    "the welded pipelines subjected to high pressure and temperature are widely used in different branches of industry . under such conditions , the creep and damage effects should be taken into account for accurate assurance of long - term reliability @xcite .",
    "application of computational continuum creep damage mechanics ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite ) coupled with increasing power of computers can accomplish this task . in recent years the finite element method has become the widely accepted tool for the structural analysis in the creep range @xcite .",
    "a user defined creep material subroutine with appropriate constitutive and evolution equations can be developed and incorporated into the commercial finite element code to perform a numerical time step solution of creep and long term strength problems .",
    "on the other hand , in addition to more and more sophisticated numerical analysis , simplified models of creep response are required .",
    "these models should provide a better intuitive insight into the problem and give a quantitative description of the solution .",
    "the assessment of reliability of user - defined creep material subroutines and the choice of suitable numerical parameters like the element type , the mesh density , and time step control are complicated problems , particulary if studying creep of multi - material structures .",
    "therefore , it is important to have reference solutions of benchmark problems .",
    "such solutions should be obtained by use of alternative analytical or semi - analytical methods which do not require the spatial discretization techniques and allow for studying the behavior of stress and deformation gradients .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop an alternative semi - analytical solutions to creep problems for multi - material pipe structures .",
    "particularly we address the analysis of stress gradients in the local zones of material connections .    to obtain a semi - analytical solution we shall make the following simplifications .",
    "we assume the idealized material behavior having the secondary creep stage only . in this case",
    "the steady state solution of creep in the pipe exists , for which the stresses do not depend on time .",
    "we assume that the difference between the material properties of constituents is not great .",
    "particularly the difference between the minimum creep rates for the same stress level should not exceed the value of 2 .",
    "the lifetime of a welded pipe under creep conditions is less than that of homogeneous one .",
    "the effect of reliability reduction is of big interest , therefore large numbers of model problems were proposed .",
    "the most commonly used approach simulates weldment as a region with non - uniformly distributed material properties ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    within the framework of this approach",
    "it is often necessary to consider a number of parameter distribution cases .",
    "the amount of problems to be solved increases with the number of changing material parameters and parametric analysis becomes very complicated .",
    "drawing an analogy with some simple systems , for which an analytical solution is available ( @xcite , @xcite ) is useful for understanding how the parameter change can affect the solution .",
    "however this is not enough for a proper estimation of stress distribution .",
    "two main types of constitutive equations are often used in weld modelling , namely , norton s steady - state creep law and continuum damage mechanics equations for tertiary creep @xcite . below only the constitutive equations of norton s law",
    "are considered . even by this assumption",
    "the structural response may be captured very well .",
    "some special techniques are used to predict the failure life more precisely using steady - state solution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . as shown in @xcite , @xcite for the particular pipe welds investigated ,",
    "the steady - state analysis underestimates the failure time by about 20 - 40 percent , but predicts failure position quite well .    to simplify the parametric analysis",
    ", we study a family of boundary - value problems for multi - component pipe creep depending on a small parameter @xmath0 . when @xmath1 , the problem is reduced to the case of homogeneous pipe creep .",
    "the corresponding solution @xmath2 for the steady - state stress distribution is well known ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and considered to be the basic solution . in order to get the common solution @xmath3 from this basic one",
    ", correction terms should be added .",
    "the equations for the correction terms are formally obtained as perturbations of a boundary - value problem with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "these equations formulate a problem of linear elasticity with respect to linear - elastic solid with anisotropic elastic properties .",
    "the utility of used technique is guaranteed especially because the theory of linear elasticity is in a very satisfactory state of completion ; every complicated case of parameter distribution can be treated in a routine manner as a combination of simple ones .",
    "correction terms are obtained numerically for some problems with the help of the ritz method . in some cases",
    "the simplicity of geometry enables us to construct an approximate analytical solution .",
    "an exact expression for stress jumps at the interface is obtained .",
