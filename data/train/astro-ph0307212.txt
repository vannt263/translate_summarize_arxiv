    "gravitational lensing provides a unique method to directly map the distribution of dark matter in the universe .",

    "these cosmic shear surveys provide direct measurements of large - scale structure in the universe and , therefore , of the distribution of dark matter . unlike other methods that probe the distribution of light , weak lensing measures the mass and",

    "cosmic shear can therefore be used to measure cosmological parameters in the context of these models , thereby opening wide prospects for cosmology ( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; hu & tegmark 1999 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; kaiser 1998 ) .    in the present review ,",

    "the idea of cosmic shear can be traced back to a lecture given by richard feynman at caltech in 1964 ( j.e .",
    "gunn , personal communication ) .",
    "several theorists ( e.g. , gunn 1967 , jaroszysky et al . 1990 ,",
    "kristian & sachs 1966 , lee & paczysky 1990 , schneider & weiss 1988 ) then studied the propagation of light in an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "predictions for the statistics of the weak - lensing distortions were then computed in a modern cosmological context by several groups ( babul & lee 1991 , blandford et al .",
    "1991 , kaiser 1992 , miralda - escud 1991 , villumsen 1996 ) .",
    "more recently , the power of cosmic shear to measure cosmological parameters was the object of many theoretical studies ( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; hu & tegmark 1999 ; kaiser 1998 ; kamionkowski et al . 1997 ; van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier 1999 ) . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the principles of weak lensing and show how this technique can be used to map the dark matter in the universe .",
    "as they travel from a background galaxy to the observer , photons get deflected by mass fluctuations along the line of sight ( see figure  [ fig : lensing ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the apparent images of background galaxies are subject to a distortion that is characterized by the distortion matrix : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the deflection vector produced by lensing on the sky .",
    "the convergence @xmath2 is proportional to the projected mass along the line of sight and describes overall dilations and contractions",
    ". the shear @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) describes stretches and compressions along ( at @xmath5 from ) the x - axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellip ] illustrates the geometrical meaning of the two shear components .",
    "the distortion matrix is directly related to the matter density fluctuations along the line of sight by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the newtonian potential , @xmath8 is the comoving distance , @xmath9 is the comoving distance to the horizon , and @xmath10 is the comoving derivative perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the radial weight function @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the angular - diameter distance .",
    "the function @xmath15 is the distribution of the galaxies as a function of the comoving distance @xmath8 from the observer and is assumed to be normalized as @xmath16 .",
    "as we discuss in section 4 , galaxy shapes can be averaged over a patch of the sky to measure the shear , which is thus an observable . the shear pattern expected in a standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) model",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : jsw ] for a @xmath17 deg@xmath18 region .",
    "jain , seljak , & white ( 2000 ) derived this map from ray tracing through n - body simulations .",
    "tangential patterns around the overdensities corresponding to clusters and groups of galaxies , along with a more complicated network of shear fluctuations , are apparent . by inverting the lensing equation ( equation  [ eq : psi_dchi ] ) , the shear map can be converted into a map of the projected mass @xmath2 and , therefore , of the dark matter distribution .",
    "the statistical characteristics of the cosmic - shear field can be quantified using a variety of measures , which can then be used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "first , we consider the most basic two - point statistic of the shear field , namely the two - dimensional power spectrum ( jain & seljak 1997 , kaiser 1998 , kamionkowski et al .",
    "1997 , schneider et al .",
    "1998a ) . the shear power spectrum @xmath19 is defined as a function of multipole moment @xmath20 ( or inverse angular scale ) by @xmath21 , where tildes denote fourier transforms ( with the conventions of bacon , refregier , & ellis 2000 ) , @xmath22 is the two - dimensional dirac - delta function , and the brackets denote an ensemble average . applying limber s equation in fourier space ( e.g. , kaiser 1998 ) to equation  [ eq : psi_dchi ] and using the poisson equation",
    ", one can easily express the shear power spectrum @xmath23 in terms of the three - dimensional power spectrum @xmath24 of the mass fluctuations @xmath25 and obtain @xmath26^{2 }    p\\left(\\frac{l}{r } , \\chi\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the expansion parameter , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the present value of the hubble constant and matter density parameter , respectively .",
    "the lensing power spectra for four cdm models are shown in figure  [ fig : cl ] ( see color insert ) ( see bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 for the exact cosmological parameter values of each model ) .",
    "they were derived using the fitting formula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum @xmath24 of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) . in figure 4 , the galaxies were assumed to lie on a sheet at a redshift @xmath30 .",
    "a more realistic redshift distribution @xmath31 would require corrections of only approximately 10% on these power spectra , as long as the median redshift of the galaxies were kept at @xmath30 .",
    "the three cluster - normalized models ( @xmath32cdm , ocdm and @xmath33cdm ) yield power spectra of similar amplitudes but with different shapes .",
    "the cobe - normalized scdm model has more power on a small scale and thus yields a larger normalization . for the @xmath32cdm model , the power spectrum corresponding to a linear evolution of structures is also shown in figure 4 for comparison . for",
    "@xmath34 ( corresponding to angular scales smaller than approximately 10 ) , nonlinear corrections dominate the power spectrum ( jain & seljak 1997 ) , making cosmic - shear sensitive to gravitational instability processes .",
    "the measurement of the lensing power spectrum can thus be used to measure cosmological parameters , such as @xmath29 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "( bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; hu & tegmark 1999 ; jain & seljak 1997 ; kaiser 1998 ; van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier 1999 ) .",
    "a full - sky cosmic - shear survey would yield a precision of these parameters comparable to that for future cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) missions .",
    "more realistically for the short term , a precision on the order of 10% can be achieved with surveys of approximately 10 square degrees .",
    "such cosmic - shear surveys can also be combined with cmb anisotropy measurements to break degeneracies present when the cmb is considered alone ( hu & tegmark 1999 ; contaldi , hoekstra & lewis 2003 ) .",
    "this would yield improvements in the precision of cosmological parameters by approximately one order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the use of photometric redshifts can provide a tomographic measurement of matter fluctuations and improve the precision of cosmological parameters by up to an order of magnitude ( hu 1999 , hu & keeton 2002 , taylor 2001 ) .    in practice",
    ", it often is more convenient to measure other two - point statistics .",
    "in particular , the variance of the shear @xmath38 in randomly placed cells is widely used .",
    "it is related to the shear power spectrum by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fourier transform of the cell aperture .",
    "the shear two - point correlation functions ( eg . kaiser 1998 ) are fourier transforms of the power spectra and have also been measured by various groups ( eg . bacon et al .",
    "2002 ; van waerbeke et al . 2001a ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2002a ) . the @xmath41 statistics ( schneider et al .",
    "1998a ) is another convenient statistic based on the average of the shear within a compensated filter .",
    "its advantages are that its window function in @xmath20-space is narrow , that adjacent cells are effectively uncorrelated , and that it can be easily related to the statistics of the projected mass @xmath2 .    in analogy with electromagnetism",
    ", a tensor field like the shear field @xmath42 can be decomposed into an electric ( e , or gradient ) component and a magnetic ( b , or curl ) component ( crittenden et al .",
    "2001b , kaiser 1992 , kamionkowski et al .",
    "1997 , stebbins 1996 ) .",
    "because the distortions it induces arise from a scalar field ( the gravitational potential ) , weak lensing only produces e - type fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "systematic effects and intrinsic galaxy alignments are likely to produce both e - type and b - type fluctuations ( see heavens 2001 for a review ; also see section 7.6 ) .",
    "the presence of b - modes can thus be used as a measure of contaminants to the cosmic - shear signal . in practice",
    ", this decomposition can be performed using the @xmath41 statistic ( schneider et al .",
    "1998a , van waerbeke et al .",
    "2001a ) or the power spectrum ( hu & white 2000 , padmanabhan , seljak & pen 2002 , pen et al . 2001 ) .",
    "[ eb ]    as is apparent in figure  [ fig : jsw ] , the shear field is not gaussian but , instead , has apparent coherent structures .",
    "bernardeau , van waerbeke , & mellier ( 1997 ) have shown that the skewness @xmath43 of the convergence field @xmath2 can be used to break the degeneracy between @xmath36 and @xmath29 , which is present when the shear variance alone is considered .",
    "the measurement of higher - point statistics is thus of great cosmological interest , but their computation is made difficult by the fact that the angular scales accessible to obervation ( @xmath44 ) are in the nonlinear regime .",
    "predictions for higher - point correlation functions have been calculated using perturbation theory , the hierarchical ansatz , ( bernardeau & valageas 2000 ; bernardeau , van waerbeke & mellier 1997 ; hui 1999 ; munshi & coles 2000 ; munshi & jain 2001 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2001b ) and halo models ( cooray & hu 2001a ; cooray , hu , & miralda - escud 2000 ) .",
    "these techniques have also been used to compute the full probability distribution function of the convergence field ( bernardeau & valageas 2000 , munshi & jain 2000 , valageas 2000 ) and the errors in two - point statistics ( cooray & hu 2001b ; munshi & coles 2002 ; schneider et al .",
    "2002 ) .    another possible way to compute the full nonlinear field is to use ray tracing through n - body simulations ( blandford et al .",
    "1991 ; hamana , colombi & mellier 2000 ; jain , seljak & white 2000 ; premadi et al . 2001 ; wambsganss , cen , & ostriker 1998 ; white & hu 2000 ) to produce simulated shear maps such as those by jain , seljak & white ( 2000 ) ( shown in figure  [ fig : jsw ] ) .",
    "these can be used to compute and study other proposed measures of non - gaussianity such as peak statistics ( jain & van waerbeke 2000 ) , a generalized maximum likelihood ( taylor & watts 2000 ) , and cluster counts ( bartelmann , king & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "in practice , the complex geometry of surveys makes it difficult to infer a convergence @xmath2 map from the observed shear @xmath42 . for this reason , a number of researchers",
    "have recently proposed the use of high - order statistics of the shear field rather than the skewness @xmath45 of the convergence ( bernardeau , van waerbeke , & mellier 2003 ; schneider & lombardi 2002 ; takada & jain 2002 ; zaldarriaga & scoccimarro 2002 ) .",
    "because the sought - after lensing signal is of only a few percent in amplitude , the data acquisition and analysis must be performed carefully , and systematic effects must be tightly controlled .",
    "all the current measurements of cosmic shear were derived from deep optical images taken with charged - coupled devices ( ccd ) .",
    "it is advantageous for the exposures to be homogeneous in depth and for the ground to be subject to as small a seeing as possible .",
    "the fields are generally chosen to lie far away from each other to ensure that they are statistically independent and to minimize cosmic variance .",
    "the first step in the data analysis is image processing .",
    "after flat fielding , the different exposures are co - added to produce the final reduced images . if necessary , any instrumental distortion induced by the telescope optics is corrected for at this stage .",
    "this can be done very accurately by measuring the astrometric offsets from several dithered exposures . for a detailed description of the different image - processing steps , see kaiser et al .",
    "an example of a processed deep image from the cosmic - shear survey of bacon , refregier & ellis ( 2000 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : wht ] .",
    "the next step consists of deriving an estimator for the shear from the shapes of the galaxies in the co - added images .",
    "the point - spread function ( psf ) , which smears the images of galaxies and is generally not circular , complicates this task . in general , the psf varies spatially and in time , and it must be measured and modelled for each image individually .",
    "this can be done by measuring the shape of the stars in the field , whose number can be optimized by tuning the galactic latitudes of the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig : star ] shows the ellipticity pattern of the psf from one of the william hershel telescope ( wht ) fields of bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 .",
    "several methods have been developed to tackle this difficult and crucial task .",
    "the more rigorous method of kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( ksb ; 1995 ) , further developed by luppino & kaiser ( 1997 ) and hoekstra et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , replaced the earlier method by bonnet & mellier ( 1995 ) .",
    "the ksb method is now widely used for cluster studies , and it has been used by the majority of the groups involved in measuring cosmic shear ( see bartelmann & schneider 1999 for a detailed review of the ksb method ) . it is based on the measurement of the quadrupole moment of the galaxy surface brightness @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a weight function conveniently taken to be gaussian .",
    "these moments capture the lowest - order shape information of the galaxy and can be combined to form the ellipticity of the galaxy @xmath49 the first ( second ) component of the ellipticity describes compressions and elongations along ( at 45@xmath50 from ) the x and y axes ( see figure  [ fig : ellip ] for an illustration ) .",
    "the ellipticity vanishes for circular galaxies .    .",
    "[ fig : star ]    the first step in the ksb method is to correct the observed galaxy ellipticity @xmath51 for the anisotropy of the psf .",
    "the corrected galaxy ellipticity @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the psf ellipticity derived from the stars , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the smear susceptibility tensors for the galaxy and star , respectively , and can be derived from higher moments of the images .",
    "the shear in a patch of the sky can then be measured by averaging over the ( corrected ) ellipticities in the patch of the sky using @xmath57 where the tensor @xmath58 quantifies the susceptibility to shear acting before isotropic psf smearing and is given by @xmath59 where the shear susceptibility tensors @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the galaxies and the stars can also be measured from higher moments of their respective light distribution .",
    "the ksb method was thoroughly tested using realistic simulated images by erben et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and bacon et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "these studies showed that it is accurate to within a few tenths of percent in reconstructing an input shear and is thus sufficient for the current cosmic - shear surveys ( see section 5 ) .",
    "however , this accuracy is insufficient for future , more sensitive surveys ( see section 6 ) .",
    "moreover , kuijken ( 1999 ) and kaiser ( 2000 ) have shown that the ksb method is ill - defined mathematically and unstable for psf s found in practice .",
    "this inadequacy has led a number of researchers to develop alternative methods .",
    "rhodes , refregier & groth ( 2000 ) have modified the ksb method to be better suited for hst images .",
    "kuijken ( 1999 ) considered a different approach that consisted of fitting the observed galaxy shape with a smeared and sheared circular model .",
    "kaiser ( 2000 ) introduced a new method based on a finite resolution shear operator .",
    "refregier & bacon ( 2003 ) and , independently , bernstein & jarvis ( 2001 ) developed a new method based on the decomposition of the galaxies into shape components or `` shapelets '' .",
    "the gauss - hermite orthogonal basis functions used in this approach allow shears and psf convolutions to be described as simple matrix operations , using the formalism developped for the quantum harmonic oscillator ( refregier 2003 ) .",
    "these new methods are promising but require extensive testing to establish whether they will achieve the required precision .",
    "because the expected distortions are only of a few percent , the measurement of cosmic shear requires large survey areas and excellent image quality .",
    "early searches for cosmic shear signals with photographic plates were unsuccesful ( kristian 1967 ; valdes , jarvis & tyson 1983 ) .",

    "the future radio telescopes lofar ( low frequency array ) and ska ( square kilometer array ) will yield cosmic - shear measurements of comparable sensitivity to the most ambitious optical surveys ( schneider 1999 ) .",
    "the advantages of radio surveys are that they cover large solid angles , that the bright radio sources are at a higher redshift , and that the psf is fully predictable and reproducible .",
    "these future surveys will provide very accurate measurements of cosmological parameters through the measurement of the lensing power spectrum and higher - order statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : cl_omw ] ( see color insert ) shows , for instance , the excellent accuracy with which the lensing power spectrum will be measured with the snap wide survey . they will also allow us to test some of the foundations of the standard cosmological model .",
    "for example , the measurement of the power spectrum on nonlinear scales at different redshift slices , and of the hierarchy of high - order correlation functions , will yield a direct test of the gravitational instability paradigm .",
    "the lensing power spectrum can also be used to measure the equation of the state of the dark energy @xmath73 and thus complement supernovae measurements in the constraining of quintessence models ( benabed & bernardeau 2001 ; hui 1999 ; huterer 2001 ; hu 2001 , 2002 ; munshi & wang 2002 ; weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cl_omw ] shows , for instance , that a change of 40% in @xmath73 can easily be measured by snap ( see refregier et al .",
    "cosmic - shear measurements can also be used to test general relativity ( uzan & bernardeau 2001 ) .    another promising approach",
    "to measure weak lensing is to use the fluctuations of the cmb temperature as the background sources ( bernardeau 1997 , 1998 ; cooray & kesden 2002 ; hirata & seljak 2002 ; hu 2000 ; seljak 1996 ; seljak & zaldarriaga 1999 ; zaldarriaga & seljak 1998 ) .",
    "because these fluctuations are produced at a redshift of approximately 1100 , cmb lensing provides a probe of the evolution of mass fluctuations at redshifts larger than those probed by optical galaxies .",
    "lensing indeed produces distinct non - gaussian signatures that can be used to reconstruct the foreground mass distribution and probe the growth of structures .",
    "this approach will become feasible with the advent of future cmb missions such as planck surveyor or ground - based instruments with high angular resolutions .",
    "for the future surveys described above to yield their full potential , a number of challenges must be met . indeed , these surveys require the measurement of shears on the order of 1% with an accuracy better than 0.1% ; thus , they require a very tight control of systematic effects . in the following , we review the main sources of systematics .      the most serious systematic for ground - based surveys",
    "is that produced by the rather large psf ellipticities ( @xmath74 ) observed by the different groups . the ksb method ( see section 4 ) provides a correction of the psf anisotropy by , at most , a factor of approximately 10 , which is insufficient for a precision of 0.1% in shear .",
    "although new shear measurement methods may improve upon this ( see section 4 and below ) , the correction is fundamentally limited by the finite surface density and signal - to - noise ratio of the stars used to measure the psf shape .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary for the psf ellipticity to be reduced in hardware as well as in software .",
    "this can be done by using tighter constraints in the tracking and optical systems of the new telescopes and instruments as well as with interactions between telescope designers , engineers , and scientists .      even if the psf ellipticity were guaranteed to be isotropic ,",
    "future measurements will be limited by the precision of the shear measurement methods .",
    "the ksb method is accurate to measure shears of approximately 1% with only a 10% accuracy ( bacon et al .",

    "this will soon become an important limiting factor ( see hirata & seljak 2003 ) .",
    "although new methods ( see section 4 ) promise to improve upon this , more extensive simulations are required to establish that the same accuracy can be reached for shears of 0.1% .      to convert cosmic - shear measurements into constraints on cosmological parameters , the redshift distribution of the background galaxies must be known ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the median galaxy redshift is already one of the dominant contributions to the uncertainty in the amplitude of the matter power spectrum from cosmic shear .",
    "the determination of the galaxy redshift distribution is made difficult by the depth of the cosmic - shear surveys .",
    "in addition , the sample of galaxies is not simply magnitude limited , but it is subject to complex selection cuts throughout the shear measurement pipeline .",
    "dedicated spectroscopic surveys and photometric redshift studies ( such as that by brown et al .",
    "2003 ) are thus required to overcome this limitation .",
    "all the shear measurement methods rely on the assumption that the instrumental response is linear .",
    "it is therefore important to test whether ccd cameras do not have subtle pixel - to - pixel nonlinearities that would induce biases in the shear measurements .",
    "the mean shear offset and the shear gradient across the chip found by van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) could be due to this effect .",
    "two neighboring galaxies in an image yield `` peanut - shaped '' isophotal contours and thus appear to have aligned ellipticities .",
    "this overlapping - ellipticities effect may produce a spurious ellipticity correlation signal on small scales .",
    "van waerbeke et al . ( 2000 ) suggested that this effect may explain the excess shear signal , which they measured on small scale and which disappeared when close pairs were discarded .",
    "evidence for this effect was also found in the image simulation by bacon et al .",
    "more extensive and detailed simulations would need to be performed to ascertain and calibrate this effect .",
    "the measurement of the lensing shear relies on the assumptions that , in the absence of lensing , the ellipticities of the galaxies are uncorrelated .",
    "however , an intrinsic correlation of galaxy shapes could exist owing to the coupling of the galaxy angular momentum or shape to the tidal field or to galaxy interactions ( see heavens 2001 for a review ) .",
    "theoretical estimation of the size of this effect has been performed using numerical simulations ( croft & metzler 2000 ; heavens , refregier & heymans 2000 ; jing 2002 ) and analytical methods ( catalan , kamionkowski & blandford 2001 ; crittenden et al .",
    "2001a , b ; lee & pen 2001 ; mackey , white & kamionkowski 2001 ) . measurements of intrinsic correlations have also been performed ( brown et al . 2000 ; pen , lee & seljak 2000 ) .",
    "although considerable uncertainty remains regarding the amplitude of this effect , a consensus is arising that intrinsic correlations are likely to be small for the deep current surveys with @xmath75 , but may be dominant for shallower surveys with @xmath76 ( see however the conflicting results of jing 2002 ) .",
    "although lensing distortions are coherent over a large redshift range , intrinsic alignments are only significant for small physical separations .",
    "photometric redshifts can thus be used to separate and reduce intrinsic correlations from cosmic - shear signals ( heymans & heavens 2002 ; king & schneider 2002a , b ) .",
    "another approach is to search for the @xmath77-type correlation signal produced by intrinsic correlations ( crittenden et al .",
    "[ intrinsic ]      most of the signal in cosmic - shear surveys arises from small scales ( @xmath44 ) and thus from nonlinear structures ( jain & seljak 1997 ) .",
    "the existing prescriptions for computing the nonlinear corrections ( peacock & dodds 1997 ; ma 1998 ) to the matter power spectrum are only accurate to approximately 10% and disagree at that level with one another ( see discussion in huterer 2001 ) .",
    "this theoretical uncertainty will soon become one of the dominating errors in the determination of cosmological parameters from cosmic - shear surveys ( see discussion in van waerbeke et al .",
    "new prescriptions based on more recent n - body simulations such as those by smith et al .",
    "( 2003 ) will help improve the accuracy of the predictions .",
    "the problem of the prediction of higher - order statistics is even more difficult , but it is not as pressing given the large uncertainties in the the measurements within current surveys ( see bernardeau , mellier , van waerbeke 2002 ) .",
    "the inclusion of second - order terms in the weak - lensing approximation will eventually also be required ( cooray 2002 , cooray & hu 2002 ) .",
    "these systematic effects must be controlled to match the statistical accuracy of future surveys .",
    "along with the studies suggested above , further measurements with different colors and comparison of various surveys in overlapping regions would help to control systematics and to test data analysis pipelines . on the theoretical side ,",
    "larger simulations coupled with advanced analytical techniques will be required .",
    "cosmic shear has emerged as a powerful method to measure the large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "it can be thought of as the measurement of background fluctuations in the space - time metric .",
    "although other methods rely on assumptions relating the distribution of light to that of the mass , weak lensing is based on `` clean '' physics and can be directly compared to theory .",
    "the past three years have yielded impressive observational progress , as the first statistical detections and measurements of cosmic shear have been achieved . in analogy with the cmb",
    ", cosmic shear has moved from the cobe era to that of the first generation of anisotropy experiments .",
    "however , the measurement of cosmic shear differs from that of cmb anisotropies in several respects .",
    "first , the fluctuations are on the order of @xmath78 as opposed to @xmath79 , making them easier to measure while retaining the validity of linear calculations .",
    "second , the cosmic - shear field is non - gaussian and therefore contains more information than that quantified by the power spectrum .",
    "existing cosmic - shear measurements have started to yield significant constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the measurement of the amplitude of the matter power spectrum @xmath80 from cosmic shear should soon replace that derived from the local abundance of clusters .",
    "this latter technique is indeed limited by the finite number of bright clusters and by systematic uncertainties in the physics of clusters . with better statistics ,",
    "the angular and redshift dependence of the shear signal as well as with higher - order moments of the convergence field will break the degeneracy between @xmath36 and @xmath29 and yield constraints on further parameters such as @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "the current measurements of cosmic shear are now primarily limited by statistics .",
    "they will therefore be improved upon by a number of upcoming and future instruments such as megacam , vst , vista , lsst , and pan - starrs from the ground , and hst / acs and snap in space . for several of these instruments ,",
    "a weak - lensing survey has been listed as one of the primary science drivers .",
    "these surveys will potentially yield measurements of cosmological parameters that are comparable in precision and complementary to those derived from the cmb .",
    "they will also be able to address more far - reaching questions in cosmology by measuring parameters beyond the standard model .",
    "for instance , they can be used to provide a test of the gravitational instability paradigm , a measure of the equation of state of the dark energy , and a test of general relativity .    for these instruments to yield the full promise of cosmic shear ,",
    "a number of challenges have to be met .",
    "first , observationally , systematic effects , such as the psf anisotropy and ccd nonlinearities , must be controlled and corrected for . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", calculations of the nonlinear power spectrum , of high - order statistics , and of the associated errors must be improved to meet the precision of future measurements .",
    "the observational and theoretical efforts required to overcome these difficulties are worthwhile given the remarkable promise that cosmic shear offers to cosmology .",

    "<S> weak gravitational lensing provides a unique method to map directly the distribution of dark matter in the universe and to measure cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this cosmic - shear technique is based on the measurement of the weak distortions that lensing induces in the shape of background galaxies as photons travel through large - scale structures . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is now widely used to measure the mass distribution of galaxy clusters and has recently been detected in random regions of the sky . in this review , </S>",
    "<S> we present the theory and observational status of cosmic shear . we describe the principles of weak lensing and the predictions for the shear statistics in favored cosmological models . </S>",
    "<S> next , we review the current measurements of cosmic shear and show how they constrain cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we then describe the prospects offered by upcoming and future cosmic - shear surveys as well as the technical challenges that have to be met for the promises of cosmic shear to be fully realized .    </S>",
