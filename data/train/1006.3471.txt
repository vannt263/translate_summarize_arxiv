    "however , the formation of the sc state is inhibited by the formation of long range magnetic order of the eu@xmath1 moments .",
    "a similar result has been reported previously in undoped eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the important difference in the present study on eufe@xmath2co@xmath3as@xmath0 is that upon increasing pressure @xmath43 increases while @xmath44 decreases and , therefore , @xmath54 becomes greater than @xmath55 above a certain pressure @xmath46 .",
    "once @xmath56 no signature of superconductivity is found anymore .",
    "we take this as an evidence for the strong detrimental effect of the eu@xmath1 magnetism on the the formation of the sc state . as our ac - susceptibility results indicate eu@xmath1 orders ferromagnetically under pressure .",
