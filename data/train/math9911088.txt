    "this is an expository paper on the symplectic and algebraic geometry implicit in _ horn s problem _ , which asks the possible spectra of a sum of two hermitian matrices each with known spectrum .",
    "the connection with symplectic geometry is very straightforward : the map @xmath3 that takes a pair of hermitian matrices with known spectra to their sum is a _ moment map _ for the diagonal conjugation action of @xmath4 on a certain _ symplectic manifold _ ( definitions to follow ) .",
    "this is a very restrictive property of maps , and many things can be proved about them .",
    "the proofs , at heart , are not really any different than the techniques horn himself used to study this map . nonetheless the framework is worth understanding in order to recognize what other linear algebra problems are likely to have answers as nice as the ones to horn s problem .",
    "in particular the schur - horn theorem follows very easily from the general theorems in this area ( and was a primary inspiration for them ) .",
    "some of the more esoteric connections  to algebraic geometry and representation theory  can also be seen in this context , via the kirwan / ness theorem ( which we will also state ) .",
    "again , the basic techniques used are the same , but in the kirwan / ness theorem one sees these techniques pushed to prove the statements in what appears to be their proper generality .    along the way we explain the relation between hermitian matrices , flag manifolds , and the borel - weil - bott - kostant theorem .",
    "let @xmath5 be a weakly decreasing list of real numbers , which we ll use to encode the eigenvalue spectrum of a hermitian matrix .",
    "the schur - horn theorem states the following :    let @xmath6 be the space of hermitian matrices with spectrum @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 take a matrix to its diagonal entries .",
    "then the image of @xmath9 is a convex polytope , whose vertices are the @xmath10 permutations of @xmath7 .",
    "this theorem was interpreted by kostant in 1970 as the @xmath4 case of a theorem for arbitrary compact lie groups , leading the way to a much wider generalization found in 1982 by atiyah and independently by guillemin and sternberg :    let @xmath11 be a compact connected symplectic manifold , with an action of a torus @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a moment map for this action .",
    "then the image of @xmath9 is a convex polytope , the convex hull of the images of the @xmath12-fixed points on @xmath11 .    of course , to see how to cast the schur - horn theorem in this formulation",
    ", we ll need to define `` symplectic manifold '' and `` moment map '' .",
    "we will make no attempt to be encyclopdic in our references and instead direct the reader to    * @xcite  for all matters symplectic or convex * @xcite  for the algebraic geometry of flag manifolds * @xcite  for geometric invariant theory * chapter 8 of @xcite  for the kirwan / ness theorem    and references therein .",
    "let @xmath11 be a manifold , and @xmath14 an _ anti_symmetric inner product on the tangent spaces to @xmath11 , sort of a skew riemannian metric . since the inner product of any vector with itself is zero , we ca nt talk about positive definiteness , and so we instead ask for nondegeneracy  that for any tangent vector @xmath15 , there exists another vector @xmath16 with @xmath17 nonzero .",
    "surprisingly , this forces @xmath11 to be even dimensional .",
    "there is a standard example : @xmath18 with basis @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , but @xmath21 ( kronecker delta ) .",
    "if @xmath22 is locally isomorphic to @xmath18 with its standard @xmath14 , we say that @xmath11 is a * * symplectic manifold , and call @xmath14 its * * symplectic form .",
    "this is roughly analogous to studying riemannian manifolds that are locally euclidean .    as with a riemannian metric",
    ", we can talk about the * * symplectic gradient @xmath23 of a function @xmath24 , also called the hamiltonian vector field @xmath23 associated to a hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "it is defined uniquely by the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 are tangent vectors to the point @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the directional derivative of @xmath24 in the direction @xmath29 . that this defines @xmath23 uniquely follows from @xmath14 s nondegeneracy .",
    "it is easy to show that symplectic gradients have an immense advantage over riemannian gradients : the derivative of @xmath14 along @xmath23 vanishes . in integral form",
    "this says that the time @xmath30 flow map from @xmath11 to @xmath11 , given by following @xmath23 for time @xmath30 , takes @xmath14 to itself .",
    "let @xmath31 , and @xmath14 be the area form , taking a pair of vectors to the oriented area of the parallelogram they define .",
    "let @xmath24 be the height function on @xmath11 , normalized to take the north pole to @xmath32 and the south pole to @xmath33 .",
    "then the riemannian gradient points down everywhere along longitude lines , as in figure [ fig : example1 ] , whereas the symplectic gradient points sideways everywhere along latitude lines  and generates rotations , which are of course area - preserving .",
    "this gives us a handy way to describe ( certain ) flows on a symplectic manifold  in terms of functions , which opens up the world of e.g. morse theory .",
    "one example of this connection : a critical point of a function @xmath24 is one where all the directional derivatives are zero , which ( by @xmath14 s nondegeneracy ) is equivalent to the vanishing there of @xmath23 .",
    "so the critical points of @xmath24 are exactly the fixed points of the flow generated by its symplectic gradient @xmath23 .",
    "now let @xmath11 be a symplectic manifold with symplectic form @xmath14 , and an action of a connected lie group @xmath34 ; for us @xmath34 will always be the circle group @xmath35 , a product @xmath12 of circle groups , or the unitary group @xmath4 .",
    "if we assume @xmath34 acts smoothly on @xmath11 , the elements of @xmath34 nearby the identity give us diffeomorphisms of @xmath11 very close to the identity ; differentiating this picture , we find that each tangent vector to the identity of @xmath34 gives a vector field on @xmath11 .",
    "denote the tangent space to the identity , also known as the lie algebra of @xmath34 , by @xmath36 , and its dual by @xmath37 .",
    "( this funny letter is a fraktur @xmath38 . )    since @xmath34 acts on itself by conjugation , fixing the identity , it acts on @xmath36 ; this is called the * * adjoint representation , and the induced action on @xmath37 the * * coadjoint representation .",
    "we say that a map @xmath39 is a * * moment map for the action of @xmath34 on @xmath11 if    1 .",
    "@xmath9 is equivariant , i.e. @xmath40 2 .   for each @xmath41 , the vector field induced on @xmath11 by @xmath42",
    "equals the symplectic gradient of @xmath43 .",
    "( we are using here the natural pairing between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . )    note that for the action to have a moment map at all , the action of @xmath34 on @xmath11 must preserve the symplectic structure .",
    "this is almost sufficient ( but not quite ) ; in any case all the actions considered in this paper will have moment maps .",
    "if the action has a moment map it is said to be * * hamiltonian and @xmath11 is called a * * hamiltonian @xmath34-manifold .",
    "since @xmath34 is connected , we can recover its action from the action of the lie algebra , which in turn we can get from the moment map ; in particular the moment map uniquely determines the action .",
    "( the action does not determine the moment map uniquely even when one exists , but only up to certain translations . ) and while any map @xmath44 will give us associated vector fields @xmath45 , very few maps will give actions of @xmath34 ; moment maps are very special .",
    "we need four particularly important facts about moment maps .",
    "( all follow easily from the definition . )    1 .",
    "let @xmath34 act on @xmath11 with @xmath46 a moment map for the action on @xmath11 , and @xmath47 be a lie group homomorphism , making @xmath48 act on @xmath11 too .",
    "there is a corresponding map of lie algebras @xmath49 , and a dual map @xmath50 .",
    "then the action of @xmath48 is also hamiltonian , with moment map given by composing @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the case of greatest interest is when @xmath48 is a subgroup of @xmath34 , and @xmath53 is inclusion .",
    "2 .   let @xmath11 be a * * coadjoint orbit , i.e. an orbit of @xmath34 s action on @xmath37 .",
    "then there exists uniquely a symplectic structure on @xmath11 such that the inclusion map @xmath54 is a moment map .",
    "( this was called the kirillov - kostant - souriau symplectic structure until alan weinstein found it in 19th - century notebooks of lie . )",
    "let @xmath11 be a hamiltonian @xmath34-manifold , and @xmath55 a hamiltonian @xmath48-manifold .",
    "then the natural action of @xmath56 on @xmath57 is hamiltonian , with moment map the direct sum of the two individual moment maps .",
    "let @xmath11 be a hamiltonian @xmath34-manifold , and @xmath55 a submanifold of @xmath11 invariant under @xmath34 , such that the restriction of the symplectic form on @xmath11 is nondegenerate on @xmath55 ( making @xmath55 a symplectic manifold in a natural way ) .",
    "then the action of @xmath34 on @xmath55 is also hamiltonian , with moment map the composition of inclusion with @xmath11 s own moment map .",
    "since the image of a moment map is @xmath34-invariant , it must be a union of coadjoint orbits ; in this way one can regard the individual coadjoint orbits as sort of `` minimal '' hamiltonian @xmath34-manifolds .",
    "( this is only interesting for nonabelian groups @xmath34 , insofar as the coadjoint action is trivial for abelian groups , with the coadjoint orbits just points . )    let @xmath58 with the standard symplectic form , and @xmath59 acting on @xmath11 by rotation .",
    "then we can identify @xmath34 s tangent space with @xmath60 , such that the moment map is @xmath61 .",
    "the image of @xmath9 is the positive half - line .",
    "let @xmath62 with the standard symplectic form , and @xmath63 , each circle acting on a pair of the coordinates  really the @xmath64th power of the previous example .",
    "then we can identify @xmath34 s tangent space with @xmath65 .",
    "the image of @xmath9 is the positive `` orthant '' ( the @xmath66-dimensional generalization of the first quadrant in @xmath67 , octant in @xmath68 , etc . ) .",
    "this second example gives a hint of the source of convex polytopes in the atiyah / guillemin - sternberg theorem stated above ; since we ve defined a symplectic manifold as one that looks locally like @xmath18 with the standard form , we just need to prove a `` @xmath12-equivariant version '' of that local normal form , in order to know that at least locally the image of the moment map is a polytope . the actual proof of a / g - s requires some more ingredients ( not explored here ) to show the global statement .",
    "let @xmath69 :     z_i \\hbox { not all } 0\\}/{{\\mathbb c}}^\\times$ ] , complex projective @xmath64-space .",
    "this has a natural symplectic form ( the fubini - study form ) we do not pause to write down , and a hamiltonian action of @xmath70 , whose lie algebra we can identify with @xmath71 .",
    "one moment map is then @xmath72 ) = \\bigg ( \\frac{|z_0|^2}{\\sum_i |z_i|^2 } ,    \\frac{|z_1|^2}{\\sum_i |z_i|^2},\\ldots ,    \\frac{|z_n|^2}{\\sum_i |z_i|^2 } \\bigg).\\ ] ] the individual coordinates can only vary between @xmath73 and @xmath32 , and their sum is automatically @xmath32 ; it is easy to check that the image is the whole simplex .",
    "in fact this is really the @xmath74 case of the schur - horn result .",
    "let @xmath34 be the unitary group @xmath4 , and @xmath12 the subgroup of diagonal matrices , a `` maximal torus '' of @xmath4 .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath75 is the space of skew - hermitian matrices .. a unitary matrix near the identity , @xmath76 , therefore has @xmath77 .",
    "differentiating , we get @xmath78 .",
    "] we can identify the hermitian matrices with @xmath79 using the trace form , @xmath80 .",
    "this identification is @xmath4-equivariant , intertwining the conjugation action with the coadjoint action ; in particular it takes orbits of hermitian matrices to coadjoint orbits .",
    "the upshot is that we can think of coadjoint orbits of @xmath4 as orbits of @xmath4 acting on the space of hermitian matrices by conjugation , which of course are the isospectral sets @xmath6 required for the schur - horn theorem .    from this point",
    ", we just have to apply properties 1 and 2 of moment maps ; @xmath6 is a symplectic manifold , and the action of the diagonal subgroup @xmath12 is hamiltonian with moment map @xmath81 .",
    "using our trace form identification , this composite is the map taking a hermitian matrix with spectrum @xmath7 to its diagonal entries .",
    "then the a / g - s convexity theorem tells us that the image is the convex hull of images of @xmath12-fixed points .",
    "a hermitian matrix is fixed under conjugation by all diagonal matrices if and only if it itself is diagonal , which means its entries are a permutation of @xmath7 .",
    "this proves schur - horn .",
    "( of course this presentation is historically unfair , as indicated at the beginning ",
    "the schur - horn theorem was a primary inspiration for a / g - s convexity . )",
    "we mention one of the many easy properties of the definition of moment map .",
    "the * * stabilizer algebra of a point @xmath82 for the action of a lie algebra @xmath36 is defined as the lie subalgebra giving vector fields that vanish at @xmath82 .",
    "( correspondingly , the flows they generate leave @xmath82 fixed , so the stabilizer algebra is the lie algebra of the stabilizer group of @xmath82 . )",
    "let @xmath11 be a hamiltonian @xmath34-manifold , with moment map @xmath9 , and @xmath27 .",
    "then the stabilizer algebra of @xmath82 is the perp of the image of the differential @xmath83 mapping from the tangent space at @xmath82 to @xmath37 .",
    "( again we re using the natural pairing between @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; the perpendicular of a subspace of @xmath37 is a subspace of @xmath36 . )",
    "a vector @xmath42 is in the stabilizer algebra of @xmath82 iff the vector field induced on @xmath11 vanishes at @xmath82 , iff the symplectic gradient of @xmath84 vanishes at @xmath82 , iff the differential @xmath85 vanishes at @xmath82 , iff @xmath86 vanishes at @xmath82 , which means @xmath42 is in the perp of the image of the differential @xmath83 at @xmath82 .",
    "there are two interesting extremes of this .",
    "one is that @xmath82 s stabilizer group in @xmath34 is discrete if and only if @xmath82 s stabilizer algebra in @xmath36 is trivial if and only if the differential of @xmath9 at @xmath82 is onto .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath82 is a @xmath34-fixed point if and only if all of the vector fields induced by @xmath36 vanish at @xmath82 if and only if the differential of @xmath9 at @xmath82 is zero .",
    "let @xmath87 be a boundary point of the image of a moment map @xmath88 .",
    "then each point in @xmath89 is stabilized by at least a circle subgroup of @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath90 is an extremal point , the image of the differential ca nt be onto  some directions from @xmath90 lead outside the image of @xmath9 .",
    "so the perp to the differential is positive - dimensional , and generates a positive - dimensional subgroup of @xmath34 , the connected component of the stabilizer group .",
    "and any positive - dimensional compact group contains a circle group .",
    "we include these proofs to show off the simple connection between the action of the lie group and the properties of a moment map .",
    "while a / g - s convexity is based on morse theory applied to the moment map , the results above are much more pedestrian and use only basic differential geometry .",
    "this does nt all come for free , of course  the important fact is that we happen to be studying isospectral sets of hermitians ( which turn out to be symplectic manifolds ) , and certain maps from them like `` take diagonals '' ( which turn out to be moment maps ) .",
    "most other equations one might like to study in linear algebra are not statable as the vanishing of a moment map .",
    "i personally take this framework as a guide to some of those linear algebra problems which are likely to have nice solutions .",
    "there is a different , rather less pleasant , convexity result for noncommutative groups @xmath34 .",
    "the first example is @xmath91 the group of rotations of @xmath68 , and @xmath11 a coadjoint orbit .",
    "we can identify @xmath92 with @xmath68 and so @xmath11 is a sphere centered at the origin . since this is not convex , we know we ll have to look for a slightly subtler statement than a / g - s .    in the conjugation action of @xmath4 on the space of hermitian matrices ( not naturally a symplectic manifold )",
    ", we know two nice things already ; every hermitian matrix is diagonalizable , and if we insist that the ( real ) diagonal entries then be in decreasing order , the diagonal matrix is unique .",
    "inside the space of diagonal hermitian matrices , which we can think of as the dual @xmath93 to the lie algebra of the maximal torus of @xmath4 , this picks out a certain cone @xmath94 called a * * positive weyl chamber for @xmath4 . since @xmath4 is the only example we will need we wo nt give the general definition of positive weyl chamber , but merely state that for every connected compact lie group @xmath34 , there is an analogous group @xmath12 and polyhedral cone @xmath94 , such that each orbit in @xmath37 intersects @xmath94 in a unique element .",
    "let @xmath11 be a compact connected hamiltonian @xmath34-manifold , with moment map @xmath9 .",
    "then the intersection of the image of @xmath9 with the positive weyl chamber @xmath94 is a convex polytope .",
    "this theorem is due to kirwan , and is a fair bit harder than the case @xmath34 commutative ( the a / g - s theorem above ) .",
    "the new difficulties primarily come from the points of the moment polytope lying on the boundary of the positive weyl chamber ( in the hermitian case : the hermitian matrices with repeated eigenvalues ) , which we call the * * weyl walls .",
    "we can ignore these to some extent : define the * * symplectic slice of @xmath11 as the preimage under @xmath9 of the interior of @xmath94 .",
    "it is then a theorem that the symplectic slice is symplectic , and a hamiltonian @xmath12-manifold , whose image is the @xmath34-moment polytope minus the parts hitting the weyl walls .",
    "( since it is usually noncompact we ca nt use it to trivially reduce kirwan convexity to a / g - s convexity . )",
    "there is a slightly different statement of kirwan convexity : instead of intersecting the image of @xmath9 with @xmath94 , we can compose @xmath9 with the @xmath34-invariant map @xmath95 that takes an element to the unique point in @xmath94 in its @xmath34-orbit .",
    "( for @xmath96 this takes a hermitian matrix @xmath11 to the diagonal matrix with @xmath11 s eigenvalues decreasing down the diagonal . )",
    "then kirwan convexity says that the image of this composite map is a convex polytope ( the same as constructed before by intersecting ) .    with all this machinery we can give pleasant proofs of horn s theorems ( but not horn s conjecture ! ) on the sum of two hermitian matrices .",
    "let @xmath97 be the spaces of hermitian matrices with spectrum @xmath98 .",
    "let @xmath99 take a pair of matrices to the spectrum of their sum , listed in decreasing order .",
    "then the image of @xmath100 is a convex polytope .",
    "also , if @xmath101 is an extremal point of the image of @xmath100 and is also a strictly decreasing list , then @xmath102 are simultaneously block diagonalizable .    we have already explained how to identify @xmath6 and @xmath103 with coadjoint orbits of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore by property 3 of moment maps listed above , their product has a hamiltonian action of @xmath104 .",
    "( in fact it is a coadjoint orbit for this big group . )",
    "consider the action of the diagonal @xmath4 , i.e. conjugating both hermitian matrices by the same unitary matrix .",
    "then by property 1 this action is hamiltonian , and we can compute its moment map as the transpose of the inclusion @xmath105 , composed with the @xmath104 moment map , which was just inclusion of the coadjoint orbit .    the transpose of diagonal inclusion @xmath106 is summation @xmath107 ; so the moment map for @xmath4 s action on @xmath108 just takes a pair of hermitian matrices to their sum .",
    "but now we have convexity , as our map @xmath100 is just the map used in the alternate description of kirwan s convexity theorem .",
    "if @xmath101 is a strictly decreasing list of real numbers , that means it s in the interior of the positive weyl chamber , therefore in the image of the symplectic slice , which for @xmath108 is the set of pairs @xmath109 whose sum is diagonal with decreasing entries ( already a familiar set to people studying horn s problem ) .",
    "then we can use some element of @xmath4 to conjugate @xmath109 into the symplectic slice , on which @xmath100 is the moment map for the action of @xmath12 .    since @xmath101 is on the boundary of the image of @xmath100",
    ", we can apply the corollary from subsection [ stabgrps ] , and determine that @xmath110 is invariant under some circle in @xmath12 ( and not just the scalar matrices , which fix all pairs @xmath111 ) ) .",
    "being invariant under conjugation by a nonscalar diagonal matrix forces each of @xmath112 and @xmath113 to be block diagonal .",
    "( the very careful reader will wonder why we bothered with the symplectic slice in the above , since the proposition about stabilizers did nt require that the group be a torus .",
    "but just because we knew that @xmath101 was on the boundary of the image of @xmath100 , we did nt know @xmath114 to be on the boundary of the image of @xmath4 s moment map  and in fact it potentially was nt , if @xmath101 was on a wall of the weyl chamber . )",
    "there is now an industry generalizing these convexity results to larger contexts ( such as `` poisson '' actions ) , some of which are definitely relevant to linear algebra ; we do nt pause to discuss these , as we wo nt need them for horn s problem .",
    "given @xmath11 a hamiltonian @xmath34-manifold with moment map @xmath115 , we now have a number of theorems about the image of @xmath9  put differently , about which fibers of @xmath9 are nonempty  and the action of @xmath34 on the fiber .",
    "given this setup , and a point @xmath116 fixed by @xmath34 , define the * * symplectic quotient ( or * * symplectic reduction ) of @xmath11 at the level @xmath117 as @xmath118 .",
    "there is a reason that these quotients are nicer to study than the fibers themselves :    the ( dense , open ) smooth part of @xmath118 inherits a canonical symplectic structure .",
    "( the case most frequently studied is @xmath117 is a regular value of @xmath9 , since @xmath119 is then a submanifold by the inverse mapping theorem , and the action of @xmath34 on it has only finite stabilizers as discussed in subsection [ stabgrps ] . )    in the case @xmath120 , where the conjugation action is trivial , the adjoint and coadjoint representations are also trivial .",
    "so any point @xmath121 is fixed by @xmath12 . in the case",
    "@xmath96 only the scalar hermitian matrices are fixed by conjugation .",
    "[ ex : hopf ] let @xmath122 , with the circle group @xmath123 acting by multiplication by phases . identifying the lie algebra of @xmath35 with the reals , the moment map is @xmath124 .",
    "then if @xmath125 , the symplectic quotient @xmath126 is @xmath127 ; this is the hopf fibration , fibering @xmath128 by circles . if @xmath129 , the symplectic quotient is a point . if @xmath130 , the symplectic quotient is empty .",
    "let @xmath131 be the space of hermitian matrices with spectrum @xmath7 , and @xmath120 the group of diagonal unitary matrices acting by conjugation , so @xmath9 is the map taking a hermitian matrix to its diagonal entries .",
    "then @xmath132 is the space of hermitian matrices with eigenvalues @xmath7 , and diagonal entries @xmath117 , up to conjugation by diagonal unitary matrices .",
    "these spaces are studied in the doctoral theses @xcite , and the case @xmath133 is described in detail in subsection [ ss : amusing ] .",
    "hopefully the previous section has convinced the reader that some of the fundamental objects of interest in this theory are the isospectral sets themselves .",
    "we will see now that these are not just real manifolds , but complex manifolds , suggesting that they may be studiable using complex algebraic geometry .    define a * * ( partial ) flag in @xmath134 as an increasing list @xmath135 of subspaces @xmath136 , with relative dimensions @xmath137 . if @xmath138 then @xmath135 is called a * * full flag . if @xmath139 then @xmath135 is just given by a subspace of dimension @xmath140 ( with the automatic @xmath141 and @xmath142 ) .",
    "given a hermitian matrix @xmath48 , we can associate a partial flag @xmath143 as follows : let @xmath144 be the sum of the eigenspaces corresponding to the @xmath145 smallest eigenvalues",
    ". this flag will be full if and only if @xmath48 has no repeated eigenvalues .",

    "what have we gained ?",
    "the benefit of this view is that while hermitian matrices only have an evident action of the unitary group @xmath4 , the space of flags @xmath150 has an action of the group @xmath153 of all invertible @xmath154 matrices  applying a linear transformation to a flag produces a new flag .",
    "since @xmath4 acts transitively on the hermitian matrices with a given set of eigenvalues , so too will this larger group @xmath153 act with one orbit  given two flags , there is a linear transformation taking one to the other .",
    "( and it may even be taken to be unitary . )",
    "the unitary matrices stabilizing a given hermitian matrix  say , a diagonal one with strictly decreasing eigenvalues  are easy to understand ; they are just the diagonal unitary matrices @xmath12 . from this",
    "we can conclude that if @xmath7 has no repeated eigenvalues , we can identify the space of hermitian matrices with spectrum @xmath7 with @xmath155 .",
    "for the corresponding statement for @xmath153 we must compute the stabilizer of a flag  say , the standard flag @xmath156  which can be seen to be the group @xmath157 of invertible upper triangular matrices .",
    "so we can identify @xmath158 with @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath153 is not just a real lie group but a complex lie group , and @xmath157 a complex subgroup , .",
    "by contrast , @xmath4 is not a complex subgroup because @xmath145 times a skew - hermitian matrix is not always skew - hermitian . ]",

    "since the moment map for the diagonal action of @xmath322 on this product is the sum of the individual moment maps , we can think of it as the function taking a path to its endpoint .",
