    "about 25% of all gamma - ray bursts detected by batse were `` short '' ( duration less than 2  s , * ? ? ? * ) and had hard spectra . due to the non - detection of an afterglow from a short burst , rendering quick and accurate localization unfeasible ,",
    "their nature have remained elusive .",
    "grb  @xmath0b  was detected by the _",
    "swift _  burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 2005  may  9 at 04:00:19.23 ( ut ) @xcite and upon slewing the _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) started observations of the burst 62  s after the bat was triggered .",
    "for the first time , an x - ray afterglow from a short burst was detected enabling a localization within @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "imaging of the xrt  error box showed that it overlapped with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "based on the unlikeliness of a chance alignment between grb  @xmath0b  and such a galaxy it has been argued that this is the host galaxy of the burst @xcite .",
    "however , several much fainter ( and presumably more distant ) galaxies were also detected within the xrt  error circle ( see fig.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "a unique feature of grb  @xmath0b  is that it is situated in the direction of a nearby cluster of galaxies , identified in the zwicky catalog ( zwcl  1234.0 + 02916 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the northern sky optical cluster survey with a photometric redshift of @xmath5 ( nsc  j123610 + 285901 , * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray emission from a hot intracluster medium in zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  is clearly detected by the xrt  from which @xcite determined the cluster x - ray centroid and temperature . if grb  @xmath0b  is hosted by one of the fainter galaxies beyond the cluster the emission from the burst is inevitably boosted by gravitational lensing .",
    "this could enhance the probability of detecting the burst and imply a ( possibly large ) correction to the derived burst energetics .",
    "here we ( i ) derive the x - ray flux , temperature and mass of the cluster zwcl  1234.0 + 02916and estimate the probability of a chance alignment of a gamma - ray burst and a cluster with an x - ray flux at least as large as that of zwcl  1234.0 + 02916 , and ( ii ) calculate the gravitational lensing magnification within the grb  @xmath0b  xrt  error circle , constraining scenarios where grb  @xmath0b  is gravitationally lensed .",
    "a cosmology with @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is assumed throughout this letter .",
    "all errors quoted are 90% confidence limits .",
    "the _ swift _  xrt  @xcite observed the grb  @xmath0b  region for a duration of 75  ks .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of grb  @xmath0b  is detected during the first 400  s of the xrt  observation .",
    "we investigated the x - ray emission from an intracluster medium in the cluster zwcl  1234.0 + 02916 , by analyzing xrt  data obtained after the first 400  s where the grb  @xmath0b   x - ray afterglow had faded below detection . only data taken in `` photon counting mode '' , providing full imaging and spectroscopic information , were included in the analysis yielding 31.9  ks of exposure time . using the _ xrtpipeline _ procedure version 0.8.8 in the heasoft 6.0 software package we applied standard screening parameters and the latest available calibration files ( 2005 june 1 ) to the level  1 data obtained from the _ swift _  quick - look data compilation to produce cleaned event lists of the full xrtfield of view .",
    "subsequently , the _ xselect _ tool in the heasoft 6.0 package was used to produce images and spectra with the spatial and spectral filters given below .",
    "an image was obtained in the 0.310  kev band and sources were detected using a wavelet algorithm ( _ wavdetect _ implemented in the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 3.2 software package ) .",
    "the astrometry was fixed in the following way : we measured the centroid of the x - ray afterglow in the _ swift _  frame of reference from the first 400  s of the xrt  observations .",
    "then the x - ray afterglow centroid was adjusted to match the position determined by @xcite and @xcite ( who registered a 50  ks _ chandra _ image to 2mass coordinates , and then registered a 30  ks xrt   image to the _ chandra _ image ) .",
    "hence we apply a shift to the _ swift _  reference frame of @xmath10r.a.(j2000)@xmath11 and @xmath10decl.(j2000)@xmath12 .    in order to characterize the intracluster emission , two point sources near the cluster",
    "were excluded and the source regions were filled with a poissonian pixel value distribution sampled from the surroundings ( using the _ dmfilth _ procedure in ciao 3.2 ) .",
    "finally , we ran the _ wavdetect _ procedure on the resulting image for determining the centroid of the intracluster emission .",
    "x - ray spectra were generated from events in the 0.57  kev range within a circular region centered on the cluster x - ray centroid and with a radius between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( corresponding to the radius at which the intracluster emission is @xmath15 times above the background level or equals the background level , respectively ) .",
    "the energy bounds were chosen so as to leave out the lowest energies where the spectral calibration is most uncertain , and to disregard the highest energies dominated by background .",
    "background spectra were generated from circular regions devoid of sources , not overlapping with the cluster extraction region or each other , and with the same radius as used for the intracluster emission .",
    "the average background level is @xmath16 of the intracluster emission .",
    "we used the _ xspec _ package version 12.2.0 @xcite to fit background subtracted spectra of the intracluster emission , binned to a minimum of 20  counts per bin , with a hot plasma model ( mekal , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) absorbed by neutral matter along the line of sight .",
    "the galactic absorbing column density in this direction is @xmath17  @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the intracluster x - ray emission centroid is r.a.(j2000)@xmath19 , + decl.(j2000)@xmath20 ( with an uncertainty of @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is @xmath22 off - set from the center of the xrt  error circle .",
    "the diffuse emission extends to about @xmath23 corresponding to 430  kpc for a cluster redshift of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "327  net counts ( 0.310  kev ) are detected within @xmath14 of the x - ray centroid . with the spatial resolution achieved by the photon statistics the morphology of the intracluster emission is close to circular with a slight ne - sw elongation in the cluster outskirts ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "observations obtained with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ can further reveal the structure of the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "the near coincidence between the x - ray centroid and several bright elliptical galaxies strongly suggests that this is the bottom of the cluster potential well rather than the optical center of zwcl  1234.0 + 2916 ( r.a.(j2000)@xmath24 , decl.(j2000)@xmath25 , * ? ? ? * ) or nsc  j123610 + 285901 ( r.a.(j2000)=@xmath26 , decl.(j2000)=@xmath27 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the cataloged optical cluster centers no enhancement in x - ray emission",
    "is seen .",
    "the spectrum of the intracluster medium within a radius of @xmath14 of the x - ray centroid is well fitted ( @xmath28 for 21 d.o.f . ) by a mekal model with absorption fixed at the galactic value and a typical abundance of @xmath29  @xmath30 @xcite , see fig .",
    "the best fit temperature is @xmath31  kev and the 0.52  kev flux @xmath32  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath7 .",
    "the main systematic error in determining the temperature and flux is the background subtraction . using four different background regions results in best fit temperatures between @xmath33  kev and @xmath34  kev , and 0.52  kev fluxes between @xmath35  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath7 and @xmath36  erg  @xmath18  s@xmath7 .",
    "we also investigated the influence on the best temperature from varying ( i ) the cluster emission extraction radius , ( ii ) the absorbing column density , and ( iii ) the intracluster abundance .",
    "fitting the spectrum extracted within a radius of @xmath13 of the cluster x - ray centroid yields a temperature of @xmath37  kev . letting the absorbing column density",
    "be a free parameter in the fit results in a best fit value of @xmath38  @xmath18 and the best fit temperature is @xmath39  kev .",
    "however , given that only a small amount of extra - galactic absorption is expected @xcite , and that the galactic absorbing column density is 50% uncertain in worst case , a maximum column density of @xmath40  @xmath18 is expected . for this column density ,",
    "the best fit temperature is @xmath41  kev .",
    "the abundance is constrained to be @xmath42  @xmath30 and varying the abundance in the range @xmath43  @xmath30 ( corresponding to the observed abundance variation in clusters , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) changes the best fit temperature by only @xmath44 .    from the above analysis",
    "we conclude that the global temperature of the zwcl  1234.0 + 02916intracluster medium is @xmath45  kev where the latter uncertainty is due to systematics from background subtraction . within the errors",
    "this is consistent with the temperature derived by @xcite ( @xmath46  kev ) . for a cluster redshift of @xmath4",
    "the 0.12  kev luminosity is @xmath47  erg  s@xmath7 which is in good agreement with the expected luminosity from the empirical luminosity  temperature relation of clusters @xcite .",
    "the x - ray properties of zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  thus shows it to be a cluster intermediate to the virgo and coma clusters .",
    "the cluster mass can be estimated from an empirical mass  x - ray temperature relation . using the x - ray determined mass  temperature relation of @xcite for their full sample we find @xmath48  m@xmath49 taking into account the uncertainties in the mass  temperature relation and the uncertainties in the temperature .",
    "@xmath50 is the mass within the radius at which the mean cluster density is 500  times the critical density of the universe . from the optically determined mass ",
    "temperature relation of @xcite we find @xmath51  m@xmath49 in excellent agreement with the above mass estimate .",
    "the alignment of the grb  @xmath0b  xrt  error circle and a bright elliptical galaxy , g1 , in the cluster zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  makes it relevant to consider the possibility that grb  @xmath0b  is a gravitationally lensed background source @xcite .",
    "hence , we have calculated the gravitational lensing magnification from g1 and the cluster for several possible redshifts of grb  @xmath0b .",
    "the gravitational lensing calculations were carried out using the _ gravlens _ software package @xcite .",
    "we model the galaxy as a singular isothermal ellipsoid with an axis ratio of 0.81 @xcite with the semimajor axis aligned along a position angle @xmath52 , a velocity dispersion of @xmath53  km  s@xmath7 @xcite , and the cluster as a singular isothermal sphere with @xmath54  m@xmath49 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "we take the center of the xrt  error circle to be at r.a.(j2000)@xmath55 and decl.(j2000)@xmath56 @xcite and choose that as the center of our coordinate system .",
    "we place the center of the galaxy g1 at r.a.(j2000)=@xmath57 and decl.(j2000)@xmath58 and the center of the cluster at the x - ray centroid of the diffuse cluster emission ( see section 3 ) .",
    "below we give results for point sources at the expected lower and upper limit on the grb  @xmath0b  redshift @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . due to the blue continuum and lack of emission lines in the faint galaxies in the xrt  error box ,",
    "the lower limit on their redshift is @xmath61 @xcite",
    ". the upper limit on the redshift is motivated by models predicting an intrinsic duration of a grb longer than 8  ms @xcite .",
    "we note that chosing a larger upper limit does not affect our conclusions .",
    "taking uncertainties in the velocity dispersion of g1 into account this gives an einstein radius for g1 of @xmath62  arcsec for @xmath60 and @xmath63  arcsec for @xmath59 .",
    "similarly we get for the cluster ( taking the uncertainty in the cluster mass into account ) that @xmath64  arcsec for @xmath60 and @xmath65  arcsec for @xmath59 .",
    "we then calculate the median magnification within the xrt  error circle of radius @xmath66 @xcite , see fig .",
    "most of the magnification is provided by the galaxy g1 , and the main effect of the cluster is to increase the magnification in the east - west direction .",
    "the xrt  error circle crosses the critical curves ( paths in the image plane where a point source will be exposed to infinite magnification ) for nearly all mass models of g1 and the cluster .",
    "the median of the magnification within the error circle is a factor of @xmath67 for @xmath60 and @xmath68 for @xmath59 .",
    "we thus find that potential the magnification of grb  @xmath0b  is typically a factor 12 , fairly independent of the redshift of grb  @xmath0b .",
    "however , if grb  @xmath0b  is positioned within @xmath69  of  g1 it could be more strongly magnified .",
    "we note that the source revealed by subtracting away g1 @xcite , situated @xmath70 from the center of g1 , is not a strongly lensed background source .",
    "from our gravitational lensing study we conclude that lensing is not strongly boosting the probability that grb  @xmath0b  is situated in a background galaxy . furthermore , @xcite estimate that the probability of a chance alignment between grb  @xmath0b  and g1 is @xmath71 ( using the apparent magnitude of g1 ) while @xcite arrive at probability of @xmath72 ( using the luminosity and distance of g1 ) .",
    "interestingly , a correlation between error boxes of short bursts in the batse catalog and the positions of galaxies in the local universe has been claimed @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to estimate the probability of a chance alignment between the xrt  error circle and a cluster of galaxies with an x - ray flux and optical richness at least as large as that of zwcl  1234.0 + 02916 .",
    "the sky surface density of clusters to a 0.52  kev flux limit of the zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  flux is well determined to 0.51  clusters  deg@xmath73 from several x - ray cluster surveys @xcite .",
    "the probability for a chance alignment within @xmath74 of the cluster center and the grb  @xmath0b  error circle center is equal to the sky coverage fraction of such clusters with a radius of @xmath74 , i.e.  @xmath75 .",
    "the sky surface density of clusters in the northern sky optical cluster survey with a richness at least as large as nsc  j123610 + 285901 ( @xmath76 , corresponding to less than abell richness class 0 ) is @xmath77  deg@xmath73 @xcite , yielding a chance alignment probability of @xmath78 .",
    "although a posteriori statistics is always uncertain grb  @xmath0b  comprises the first strong case for a short burst located in a galaxy cluster , based on either the x - ray flux or the optical richness of zwcl  1234.0 + 02916 .",
    "the association of grb  @xmath0b  with zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  provides independent evidence that grb  @xmath0b  is also associated with the galaxy g1 since this is a cluster member .",
    "interestingly , it has recently been suggested that the line - of - sight towards the short burst grb  050813 coincides with a cluster at redshift @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "previously , studies of the few small error boxes of short bursts have not revealed any short burst associated with a cluster @xcite    a statistical correlation between gamma - ray burst error boxes ( of short as well as long bursts ) and the position of abell clusters has been claimed @xcite , but subsequent refined analyses have failed to confirm this @xcite .",
    "however , abell clusters are relatively nearby and rich so a correlation between short bursts and abell clusters is only expected if short bursts occur predominantly within the completeness redshift of abell clusters ( @xmath80 , * ? ? ?",
    "the likely association between grb  @xmath0b  and the cluster zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  motivates further studies of the spatial correlation between galaxy clusters and short burst sky positions .",
    "since zwcl  1234.0 + 02916  is less rich than abell clusters it would be beneficial to use cluster catalogs including poorer and more distant clusters .",
    "such studies would provide interesting constraints on the environments of short bursts and hence on their origin .    if , as suggested by the favoured models @xcite , short bursts originate from merging of compact stellar remnants their progenitors are @xmath81  yr old @xcite .",
    "targeting the environment of short bursts is thus potentially a new independent way for tracing the old stellar population throughout the universe . up to now",
    ", entire populations of old stars in galaxies have been identified through their integrated optical / near - infrared colors .",
    "short bursts are promising pointers to sites of individual old stars , revealing the spatial distribution of old stars , be they located in cluster ellipticals , field galaxies , or even in intergalactic space @xcite .",
