    "let @xmath0 be a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath6 and @xmath2 a graph on @xmath0 which lifts to a triangulation of the universal cover @xmath7 . in @xcite , we initiated the study of circle packings on @xmath0 with projective structures with combinatorics controlled by @xmath2 . since we discuss projective structures which are complex structures in particular , we orient @xmath0 throughout this paper so that the orientation is the same as the one coming from the complex structure .",
    "as the circle / disk is a fundamental geometric notion for projective structures , it makes sense to ask which surfaces admit a circle packing with fixed nerve isotopic to @xmath2 , and furthermore , if the circle packings carried on these surfaces are rigid .",
    "the main results of @xcite answer these two questions when @xmath2 has exactly one vertex . in this case",
    ", the cross ratio parameter space @xmath3 associated with a graph @xmath2 on @xmath0 , which can be identified with the set of all pairs of a projective structure and a circle packing on it with nerve isotopic to @xmath2 , is homeomorphic to @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the forgetting map , @xmath9 of @xmath3 to the space @xmath10 of projective structures on @xmath0 which forgets the packing is injective .",
    "namely , the packings are in fact rigid .    on the other hand , any projective structure on @xmath0",
    "has a canonical underlying complex structure . thus assigning the underlying complex structure to each projective structure",
    ", we obtain the uniformization map @xmath11 of @xmath10 to the teichmller space @xmath12 ( thought of here as the space of complex structures ) . by taking the schwarzian derivative of the developing map ,",
    "a projective structure can be identified with a holomorphic quadratic differential over the underlying riemann surface , so the uniformization map is a complex vector bundle of rank @xmath13 over @xmath12 .",
    "for the genus one case , when @xmath2 has one vertex , it was shown by mizushima in @xcite , with slightly different language , that the composition of the forgetting map with the uniformization map is a homeomorphism . in @xcite , we conjectured that this holds in general , regardless of the genus @xmath14 and the graph @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to take the first step towards this conjecture by proving the following properness theorem for @xmath2 with one vertex :    [ theo : maintheorem ] let @xmath2 be a graph on @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) with one vertex which lifts to a triangulation of @xmath7 and @xmath3 the cross ratio parameter space associated with @xmath2",
    ". then the composition @xmath15 of the forgetting map with the uniformization map is proper .    to complete the proof of the conjecture for such graphs @xmath2 , since @xmath3 in this case",
    "was shown to be homeomorphic to @xmath8 , it suffices to show that the map is locally injective .",
    "this sort of question for the grafting map based on tanigawa s properness theorem in @xcite was settled by scannell and wolf in @xcite .",
    "see also faltings @xcite and mcmullen @xcite for earlier proofs of special cases .",
    "however , it is not clear if the proofs in the above cited papers can be extended to our setting .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we set the notations , and results required to prove the main theorem . in  3",
    ", we recall the definition of the cross ratio parameter space from @xcite and show that it is properly embedded in the euclidean space . in ",
    "4 , following the exposition in @xcite , we briefly review the thurston coordinates of @xmath10 in terms of hyperbolic structures and measured laminations , and show that the projected image of @xmath16 to the space of measured laminations on @xmath0 is bounded . the results up to that section are valid for any graph @xmath2 . in",
    " 5 , under the assumption that @xmath2 has exactly one vertex ,",
    "we show that the holonomy map from @xmath16 to the algebro - geometric quotient of the space of representations of @xmath17 in @xmath18 up to conjugacy is proper , and deduce from this that the projection of @xmath16 to the space of the hyperbolic structures in the thurston coordinates is also proper .",
    "finally , in  6 , we complete the proof of the theorem using tanigawa s inequality in @xcite .",
    "we first set the notation and recall results from @xcite to be used in the rest of the paper . since @xmath19 and @xmath2 are fixed throughout this paper , we will drop the suffices where possible to simplify the notation .",
    "let @xmath20 be a closed oriented surface of genus @xmath6 .",
    "attached to @xmath21 , we have the following spaces .    * the teichmller space @xmath22 which parameterizes either the hyperbolic or the complex structures on @xmath21 , depending on the point of view . * the measured lamination space @xmath23 which is the completion of the space of weighted simple closed curves on @xmath21 .",

    "an element @xmath31 is called a cross ratio parameter and will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that each cross ratio parameter determines a surface @xmath32 with a projective structure together with a circle packing @xmath33 on @xmath34 with nerve isotopic to @xmath2 .",
