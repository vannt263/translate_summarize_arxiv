    "this is the first part of a @xmath1 manuscript series about the properties of a novel family of time - frequency representations .",
    "the paper at hand is concerned with the introduction of warped time - frequency systems and the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for a warped time - frequency system to form a frame .",
    "such systems are of particular importance , since they allow for stable recovery of signals from their inner products with the elements of the function system . to demonstrate the flexibility and importance of the proposed time - frequency systems , we provide illustrative examples recreating ( or imitating ) classical time - frequency representations such as gabor  @xcite , wavelet  @xcite or @xmath0-transforms  @xcite .",
    "while this paper considers the setting of ( discrete ) hilbert space frames , the properties of continuous warped time - frequency systems are investigated in the second part of this series  @xcite .",
    "time - frequency ( or time - scale ) representations are an indispensable tool for signal analysis and processing .",
    "the most widely used and most thoroughly explored such representations are certainly gabor and wavelet transforms and their variations , e.g. windowed modified cosine  @xcite or wavelet packet  @xcite transforms .",
    "the aforementioned transforms unite two very important properties : there are various , well - known necessary and/or sufficient conditions for stable inversion from the transform coefficients , i.e. for the generating function system to form a frame .",
    "in addition to the perfect reconstruction property , the frame property ensures stability of the synthesis operation after coefficient modification , enabling controlled time - frequency processing .",
    "furthermore , efficient algorithms for the computation of the transform coefficients and the synthesis operation exist for each of the mentioned transforms  @xcite .    while providing a sound and well - understood mathematical foundation , gabor and wavelet transforms",
    "are designed to follow two specified frequency scales , i.e. linear and logarithmic , respectively .",
    "a wealth of approaches exists to soften this restriction , e.g. decompositions using filter banks @xcite , in particular based on perceptive frequency scales @xcite .",
    "adaptation over time is considered in approaches such as modulated lapped transforms  @xcite , adapted local trigonometric transforms  @xcite or ( time - varying ) wavelet packets  @xcite .",
    "techniques that jointly offer flexible time - frequency resolution and redundancy , the perfect reconstruction property and efficient computation are scarce however .",
    "the setting of so - called nonstationary gabor transforms , a recent generalization  @xcite of classical gabor transforms , provides the latter @xmath1 properties while allowing for freely chosen time progression and varying resolution . in this construction , the frequency scale is still linear , but the sampling density may be changed over time .",
    "the properties of nonstationary gabor systems are a matter of ongoing investigation , but a number of results already exist  @xcite . when desiring increased flexibility along frequency , generalized shift - invariant systems  @xcite , or equivalently ( nonuniform ) _ filter banks _",
    "@xcite , provide the analogous concept .",
    "they offer full flexibility in frequency , with a linear time progression , but flexible sampling density across the filters .",
    "analogous , continuously indexed systems are considered in @xcite indeed , nonstationary gabor systems are equivalent to filter banks via an application of the ( inverse ) fourier transform to the generating functions . note that all the widely used transforms mentioned in the previous paragraph can be interpreted as filter banks .    in this contribution , we investigate a particular family of filter bank frames over @xmath2 , where the filter frequency responses are obtained from a system of integer translates of a single prototype function by a nonlinear evaluation process , determined by a _ warping function _ that specifies the desired frequency scale / progression .",
    "we will show that appropriate sampling steps for the individual filters can be obtained from the derivative of the warping function .",
    "a core asset of our construction is the ease with which tight filter bank frames with bandlimited filters can be created .",
    "the idea of a logarithmic warping of the frequency axis to obtain wavelet systems from a system of translates is not entirely new and was first used in the proof of the so called painless conditions for wavelets systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the idea has never been relaxed to other frequency scales so far .",
    "while the parallel work by christensen and goh @xcite focuses on exposing the duality between gabor and wavelet systems via the mentioned logarithmic warping , we will allow for more general warping functions to generate time - frequency transformations beyond wavelet and gabor systems .",
    "the warping procedure we propose has already proven useful in the area of graph signal processing  @xcite .    a number of other methods for obtaining _ warped filter banks _ have been proposed , e.g. by applying a unitary basis transformation to gabor or wavelet atoms @xcite . although unitary transformation bequeaths basis ( or frame ) properties to the warped atoms , the resulting system is not anymore a filter bank .",
    "instead , the warped system provides an undesirable , irregular time - frequency tiling , see @xcite .",
    "closer to our own approach , braccini and oppenheim  @xcite , as well as twaroch and hlawatsch  @xcite , propose a warping of the filter frequency responses only , by defining a unitary warping operator .",
    "however , in ensuring unitarity , the authors give up the property that warping is shape preserving when observed on the warped frequency scale . in this contribution",
    ", we trade the unitary operator for a shape preserving warping in order to construct tight and well - conditioned frames more easily .",
    "the manuscript begins with a short recollection of results from the theory of nonuniform filter bank frames ( section [ sec : pre ] ) , before describing the construction of warped time - frequency systems and the induced conditions on the warping function and prototype function ( section [ sec : warp ] ) . in section [ sec : warpedframes ] , we derive conditions on a warped time - frequency system to form a frame . here",
    "we also see how the warping approach results in a straightforward procedure for the construction of tight frames from a compactly supported prototype function .",
    "we use the following normalization of the fourier transform @xmath3 and its unitary extension to @xmath2 .",
    "further , we require the _ modulation operator _ and the _ translation operator _ defined by @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively for all @xmath6 .",
    "the composition @xmath7 of two functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "when discussing the properties of the constructed function systems in the following sections , we will repeatedly use the notions of weight functions and weighted @xmath11-spaces .",
    "weighted @xmath11-spaces are defined as @xmath12 with a continuous , nonnegative function @xmath13 called _",
    "weight function_. the associated norm is defined as expected .",
    "two special classes of weight functions are of particular interest .    * a weight function @xmath14",
    "is called _ submultiplicative _ if @xmath15 * a weight function @xmath14 is called _ @xmath16-moderate _ if @xmath17 for some submultiplicative weight function @xmath16 and constant @xmath18 .",
    "submultiplicative and moderate weight functions are an important concept in the theory of function spaces , as they are closely related to the translation invariance of the corresponding weighted spaces @xcite , see also  @xcite for an in depth analysis of weight functions and their role in harmonic analysis .    in digital signal processing , function systems formed as union of a finite number translation - invariant systems over @xmath19 with possibly varying translation step",
    "are called nonuniform ( analysis ) filter banks . in this contribution",
    "we consider a countable union of systems of translates over @xmath2 or @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an unbounded interval contained in @xmath22 , but use filter bank terminology by analogy .",
    "filter bank frames have received considerable attention , e.g. in @xcite , as ( generalized ) shift - invariant systems in @xcite and as ( frequency - side ) nonstationary gabor systems in @xcite .",
    "[ def : filterbank ] let @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the we call the system @xmath25 a _ ( nonuniform ) filter bank _ for @xmath26 . the windows @xmath27 are called _ frequency responses _ and @xmath28 are the corresponding _ downsampling factors_.",
    "such filter banks can be used to analyze signals whose fourier transform is in @xmath26 . for a given signal @xmath29",
    "we call @xmath30 the filter bank _ analysis coefficients_. for many applications it is of great importance to be able to stably reconstruct from these coefficients , which is equivalent to the existence of constants @xmath31 , s.t .",
    "@xmath32 a system that satisfies this condition is called _ frame _",
    "@xcite , and the frame operator @xmath33 is invertible . in this case , the _ canonical dual frame _",
    "@xmath34 allows for reconstruction from the analysis coefficients , i.e. @xmath35    the frame property and frame operator are commonly defined in the signal domain .",
    "since our results are based on their frequency side equivalent , we use the fourier domain variants instead .",
    "the signal domain frame operator is obtained as @xmath36 .",
    "we are formerly interested in filter banks that satisfy the frame property eq .",
    ", i.e. filter bank frames .",
    "the two results presented in this section will be required in section [ sec : warpedframes ] to show that the warped filter bank construction we propose provides nicely structured time - frequency systems with intuitive and easily satisfied frame and tight frame conditions .",

    "the _ local integrability condition _ referenced in proposition [ pro : necandsuf](i ) was first used in @xcite , playing a crucial role in proving frame - theoretical results for filter banks therein and in following work @xcite .",

    "the proposition above can be combined with corollary [ cor : warpedtight ] to easily construct tight frames by choosing the downsampling factors @xmath44 to satisfy @xmath284 in the following , we will demonstrate this for the examples given in section [ sec : warp ] .",

    "in this contribution , we have introduced a novel , flexible family of structured time - frequency representations .",
    "we have shown that these representations are able to recreate or imitate important classical time - frequency representations , while providing additional design freedom .",
    "the representations proposed herein allow for intuitive handling and the application of important classical results from the theory of structured frames .",
    "in particular , the construction of tight frames of bandlimited filters reduces to the selection of a compactly supported prototype function whose integer translates satisfy a simple summation condition and sufficiently small downsampling factors .",
    "moreover , the warping construction induces a natural choice of downsampling factors that further simplify frame design . with several examples ,",
    "we have illustrated not only the flexibility of our method when selecting a warping function , or equivalently a frequency scale , but also the ease with which tight frames can be constructed .",
    "while the second part of this manuscript series  @xcite discusses the integral transform analogue of the proposed construction , the associated ( generalized ) coorbit spaces and its sampling properties in the context of atomic decompositions and banach frames  @xcite , future work will continue to explore practical applications of warped time - frequency representations and their finite dimensional equivalents on @xmath319 .",
