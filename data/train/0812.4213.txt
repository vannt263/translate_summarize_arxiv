    "the eruption of v838 mon was discovered in the beginning of january  2002 . initially thought to be a nova , the object appeared unusual and enigmatic in its nature .",
    "the eruption , as observed in the optical , lasted about three months @xcite . after developing an a - f supergiant spectrum at the maximum at the beginning of february  2002 , the object evolved to lower effective temperatures and in april  2002 it practically disappeared from the optical , remaining very bright in the infrared . at the same time a b3v companion to the erupted object was discovered in the optical @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the evolution of the object in the outburst and decline can be found , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the eruption of v838  mon , including an unusual nova @xcite , a late he - shell flash @xcite , and a stellar merger @xcite .",
    "they have critically been discussed in @xcite .",
    "these authors conclude that the only mechanism that can satisfactorily account for the observational data is a collision and merger of a low - mass pre - main - sequence star with a @xmath3 main - sequence star .    in october / november 2006",
    "the b3v companion significantly faded and a strong h@xmath4 emission appeared in the spectrum of v838  mon @xcite . late in 2004",
    "an emission - line spectrum , composed mainly of [ ] lines , started to develop @xcite , reaching its maximum around the 2006 eclipse - like event @xcite .    in the present paper we present and discuss a high resolution spectrum of v838  mon acquired with the keck  i telescope in october 2005 . at that time",
    "the [ ] emission - line spectrum was already well developed and the object was a year before the eclipse of the b3v companion .",
    "a high resolution spectrum of v838  mon was obtained on 2005 october 13 ut with the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , @xcite ) attached to the keck  i telescope .",
    "we used the c4 decker , which provides a slit with dimensions 1@xmath5148 @xmath6 3@xmath55 .",
    "the resultant resolving power was of @xmath7 .",
    "the hires instrument makes use of a 3-chip mosaic as a detector .",
    "we obtained two exposures of the object with a total time of 960@xmath8s .",
    "data reduction was performed with the iraf standard procedures @xcite .",
    "data were debiased and flat - fielded using the _ ccdproc _ task .",
    "cosmic ray events were removed from the ccd frames with a method described in @xcite . after a careful check of the removal we are confident that the procedure did not introduce any spurious effects to the spectra . order tracing and extraction were done using the tasks in the _ echelle _ package .",
    "the orders corresponding to the bluest part of the spectra were underexposed and we were not able to extract them , even with a pinhole trace as a reference .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on thar lamp observations and it is accurate to within 0.003@xmath8 .",
    "the two extracted echelle spectra were averaged giving a spectrum with a total wavelength coverage @xmath9 . in the range",
    "there are , however , numerous gaps caused by the inter - chip spaces on the mosaic and the orders that do not overlap .    using an extracted pinhole frame we corrected all the orders of the echelle spectrum for a blaze effect .",
    "inspection of the overlapping and blaze - corrected orders revealed that , although correctly flattened , they were systematically tilted in such a way that the long - wavelength end of an order was always higher on a relative intensity scale than the short - wavelength end of the neighboring order .",
    "the discrepancy was of 15% of the average intensity of the order .",
    "we reduced the tilt by multiplying each order by a linear function ( i.e. with @xmath10 in the middle of an order range , and @xmath11 at the edges ) .",
    "all the overlapping orders were then safely merged and , subsequently , we got a spectrum composed of three parts : _ ( i ) _ completely covered wavelength range over @xmath12 , _ ( ii ) _ wide range over @xmath13   with two narrow gaps at @xmath14  and @xmath15 , and _ ( iii ) _ a part of the spectrum over the range @xmath16   with 10 non - overlapping orders .",
    "the three pieces we call hereafter parts blue , green and red , respectively .",
    "since no spectrophotometric standard stars were observed during our observing run at keck  i , we decided to flux calibrate the hires spectrum on a base of the method described in @xcite , namely by using a flux calibrated spectrum of v838  mon obtained elsewhere with a lower spectral resolution .",
    "such a low resolution spectrum was acquired on 2005  november  22 with the grating spectrograph with site mounted at the 1.9  m radcliffe telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "we made use of a grating # 7 with 300 lines mm@xmath17 , and a slit with a projected width 1@xmath55 .",
    "the last figure was comparable to seeing conditions during the observation ( @xmath21@xmath54 ) .",
    "the total duration of the exposure was 1000@xmath8s .",
    "three spectrophotometric standard stars , i.e. ltt9239 , eg21 , and ltt3218 , were observed during the night .",
    "this allowed us to calibrate the low resolution spectrum in absolute flux units , while the wavelength calibration was performed with thar reference lamp spectra .",
    "all the data reduction and calibrations were carried out with standard iraf procedures .",
    "the extracted and flux calibrated spectrum covers the range @xmath18  with a resolving power of @xmath19 .",
    "the flux calibration of the hires spectrum was performed as follows .",
    "the high and low resolution spectra were corrected to the heliocentric rest frame and they were cross - correlated in order to find a relative shift between them in the wavelength domain .",
    "we found a shift of 5.5@xmath8  ( note that the value is close to the spectral resolution in the saao observations ) , which was eliminated by displacing the low resolution spectrum .",
    "next , the hires spectrum was smoothed to the resolution of the observations at saao and the spectra were divided one by the other . rather than to calibrate each single order of the echelle spectrum , as it was done in @xcite , we decided to calibrate separately only the three mentioned above parts of the merged spectrum .",
    "to each of the pieces a low order polynomial was fitted giving a conversion ratio ( cr , cf . * ? ? ?",
    "since the saao spectrum has a narrower wavelength range than the high resolution one , we extrapolated the crs to the full ranges of the blue and red parts . finally , the hires spectrum was put on the absolute flux scale by dividing its parts by the appropriate crs .",
    "we note that the flux calibration of our final spectrum is uncertain , particularly in the ranges not covered by the saao observations and in the regions where strong atmospheric molecular bands are present ( the object was observed at unequal air masses in the different facilities ) .",
    "although the low resolution spectrum was obtained about six weeks after the hires observations , we are quite confident that the spectrum of v838  mon did not change significantly during this period in the observed spectral range .",
    "a comparison of the spectra smoothed to the same resolution shows that there are no significant discrepancies which would affect the flux calibration .",
    "moreover , from the photometric behavior of the object , illustrated e.g. on the v.  goranskij s web pagegoray / v838mon.htm ] , one can see that the assumption of a constant flux in b and v bands during the period is justified .",
    "the flux calibrated spectrum was then corrected for the interstellar reddening using the iraf s task _ deredden _ with @xmath20 @xcite and with a standard ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath21 .",
    "the flux - calibrated and dereddened spectrum of v838  mon is presented in figs .",

    "wavelengths are given in the heliocentric rest frame and the units of the flux are @xmath22  erg  s@xmath17  @xmath23  @xmath17 .",
    "our observations reveal an unusual and very complex spectrum of v838  mon .",
    "it contains contributions from several physically different environments . in its blue part",
    "a photospheric spectrum of the b3v companion can be clearly seen , while the green and red parts are dominated by molecular absorptions that severly affect the flux of a very cold supergiant .",
    "a particularly striking feature of the presented spectrum is the presence of prominent emissions of [ ] .",
    "finally numerous , mostly resonance , lines showing p - cyg profiles as well as a few pure absorptions of neutral atoms can be easily found .    in the case of such a complex spectrum , detailed identification of all the features",
    "is a difficult task .",
    "the identification procedures and their results are described in the following sections .",
    "we also present results of basic measurements , e.g. radial velocities of different line systems and molecular bands .",
    "the atomic line identification was based mainly on the atomic spectra database lines form ( provided by the national institute of standards and technology , nist ) , the atomic line list version 2.04 by van hoofpeter / atomic/ ] , and on the multiplet tables by @xcite .",
    "all the identified atomic emission and absorption features are listed in tables [ atom_em_tab ] and [ atom_ab_tab ] ( respectively ) in order of their laboratory wavelengths .",
    "columns ( 1)(3 ) of the tables contain : laboratory wavelength , ion name , and multiplet number from @xcite .",
    "column ( 4 ) in table  [ atom_em_tab ] gives integrated ( dereddened ) fluxes of the emission lines ( for which a reliable measurement was possible ) .",
    "in the same column of table  [ atom_ab_tab ] the profile type ( pure absorption or p - cyg ) is specified .",
    "notes on the features are given in the last column of the tables .        a great majority of the emission features seen in the spectrum",
    "are forbidden lines of .",
    "they are remarkably numerous .",
    "we have identified 49 lines from 11 different multiplets .",
    "all of them arise from levels with energies ( above the ground level ) between 2.0 and 3.4  ev .",
    "most of them are very strong and often blended with other spectral features .",
    "in addition to these forbidden transitions , we have also found two permitted lines of at 5018    and 5169    ( a third line from the same multiplet falls in a gap between two chips ) .",
    "all the unblended [ ] emissions show practically the same but rather unusual shape .",
    "it can be well fitted with a theoretical lorentzian profile , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ feii_fig ] .",
    "the profile shown in this figure is a mean shape obtained from seven strongest and  clean \" [ ] lines .",
    "when averaging , the normalized profiles of individual lines were weighted according to the rms@xmath24 values of the local noise in the spectrum . from 30 [ ] lines , for which we successfully fitted a lorentzian profile using iraf s _ splot _ , we have obtained a typical full width at half maximum . ] ( fwhm ) of 76.3@xmath2517.7  km  s@xmath17 ( median and standard deviation ) .",

    "other forbidden lines seen in our spectrum include those of [ ] 5577   , 6300   , 6364     and [ ] 5198   .",

    "three lines recognized as [ ] 3993   , 4201   , and 4326   , are weak , which makes their identification uncertain .",

    "the following discussion is limited to h@xmath30 only , as the emission feature is most evident in this line . in order to better characterize the emission we have subtracted the underlying stellar absorption .",

    "the profile of 5110    is also exceptional .",
    "its absorption component is so deep that it removes all the light from the cold star and reaches the flux level of the b3v companion ( see top panel in fig .",
    "[ specg ] ) . in addition , it is considerably broader than most of the other p - cyg absorptions and extends from @xmath280  km  s@xmath17 to @xmath37120  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "most probably the @xmath395110 absorption is saturated .",

    "the doublet falls in a region that is dominated by a strong absorption band of tio and it is difficult to define an underlying molecular baseline .",
    "moreover , the doublet resides very close to the @xmath40 ( 1,0 ) bandhead of tio and most probably a part of the emission component of is absorbed by the saturated molecular band .",
    "a similar situation also occurs for the 7948    line .",
    "its profile is strongly affected by the ( b@xmath38x ) ( 0,0 ) absorption band of vo and the expected emission component can not be seen on the raw spectrogram .",
    "another group of identified lines are pure absorptions . beside the interstellar features ( see sect .",
    "[ ism ] ) and photospheric lines of a b - type star ( see sect .  [ hotstar ] ) , absorptions of 5060   , 5128 , 5247   , 6551   , 6102    and 6122   , and numerous lines were found .",
    "some of these lines are in the same multiplet with a line that exhibits a prominent p - cyg profile .",
    "thus , it is quite possible that in a more sensitive observations the lines , classified here as absorptions , would appear as p - cyg profiles . among the absorptions",
    "the strongest is the 5060    line , which , similarly to the p - cyg absorption component of at 5110    ( see sect .",
    "[ pcyg ] ) , appears as a very broad feature and , probably , is saturated .",
    "all the absorptions , except the @xmath395060 line , are narrower than the absorption components in the p - cyg profiles and always fall in the velocity range defined by p - cyg absorptions , indicating that they originate in the same parts of the outflowing gas .",

    "note also that the velocity of this short - wavelength component is also very close to the velocity of the nac seen in some p - cyg profiles ( see fig .  [ pcyg_fig ] ) . as can be seen from panel ( c ) in fig .",

    "the feature would correspond to the blueshifted component in the discussed above lines .",
    "note that the feature has also a profile similar to the corresponding absorptions in the other lines .",
    "a possible redshifted component can not be seen , because it falls in a region between the echelle orders .",

    "these lines are broad ( fwhm@xmath4160kms@xmath17 ) and asymmetric .",
    "contrary to the lines , they have an extended blue wing and a sharp red edge .",
    "since these lines arise from a rather high energy level ( 3.91ev above the ground level ) , they are expected to be formed close to the photosphere of the red supergiant .",
    "the complexity of the spectrum makes a direct identification of molecular bands very difficult . for identification purposes ,",
    "we have performed a series of simulations of molecular spectra .",
    "first attempts showed that a model capable of reasonably reproducing the observed molecular features should include , at least , two components , i.e. , a stellar photosphere of a cool supergiant and an absorbing outflowing material with an excitation temperature significantly lower than the stellar temperature .",

    "these models include tio opacities , what is crucial in the case of the analyzed spectrum .",
    "we chose a model atmosphere with t@xmath42=2400k , and with the lowest gravity available within the grid , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "for these parameters there is only a nextgen model with solar metallicity , what is probably close to the true metallicity of v838  mon @xcite .",
    "our choice on @xmath44 is a result of initial modeling of the observed spectrum , where we used atmosphere models for @xmath452000 , 2200 , and 2400k . with the value of 2400k",
    "we have obtained most satisfying fits to the observed band profiles from higher rotational levels .",
    "the effective temperature of the cold star can also be determined from photometric measurements . @xcite measured @xmath46 magnitudes of v838  mon on 2005  dec .  1 , while @xcite measured @xmath47 on 2005  dec .  25 and @xmath48 magnitudes on dec .",
    "thus the photometry was done @xmath22  months after our spectroscopy .",
    "given very slow evolution of the object at that epoch we can safely assume that the magnitudes did not change significantly between october and december 2005 .",
    "applying the same procedure to the above photometric results as that used in @xcite , i.e. fitting a standard supergiant photometric spectrum with @xmath49 and taking into account a contribution from a standard b3v star , we have obtained a spectral type of m67 and @xmath50  k. adopting @xmath51 and a distance of 8  kpc ( as in * ? ? ?",

    "they all are redshifted to a heliocentric velocity of @xmath260  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "it is well known that equivalent widths of the features at 5780 and 5797  correlate very well with interstellar extinction . using conversion formulae from @xcite we derived @xmath141 of 0.95 and 0.90 for the dibs at 5780    and 5797   , respectively .",
    "taking the relation from @xcite , which is based on a larger number of data points , gives @xmath142 for both features .",

    "the double feature in the h@xmath30 line can be interpreted as a single emission with a narrow absorption superimposed on it .",

    "the vibrational temperatures derived from some bands go down to @xmath2500  k. these are usually very strong bands arising from ground states .",
    "the radial velocity of these bands is usually much lower than that of the photospheric regions and goes down to @xmath147  kms@xmath17 .",
