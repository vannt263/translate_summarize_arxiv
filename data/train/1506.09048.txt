    "the vast number of phenomena of the nuclear chart depend on a relatively small set of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) parameters  in the low energies relevant for nuclear physics , a mass scale @xmath1 associated to the strong coupling constant , the masses @xmath2 of the two lightest quarks , the electromagnetic coupling strength , and the vacuum angle .",
    "lattice qcd ( lqcd ) is a numerical framework which enables us , at least in principle , to relate nuclear and qcd parameters , once effects due to finite lattice spacing and size are removed .",
    "the last few years have witnessed significant progress in predicting the properties of light nuclei with nucleon number @xmath3 , but at relatively large quark masses and neglecting time - reversal and isospin violation .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and a list of relevant references ) .",
    "increasing @xmath4 at fixed quark masses presents significant difficulties because the noise - to - signal rate increases exponentially .",
    "although there seem to be ways around this problem @xcite , large @xmath4 also requires that longer distances be covered by the lattice , since the nuclear volume increases with @xmath4 . as in other areas of physics , it is profitable to change to a more effective description , in this case to an effective field theory ( eft ) involving nucleons as degrees of freedom . because an eft is based on the most general hamiltonian with the appropriate symmetries , it is guaranteed to produce @xmath5-matrix elements consistent with the @xmath5 matrix of the underlying theory @xcite , here qcd . after matching the eft amplitudes to the lqcd - calculated quantities at small @xmath4",
    ", one can describe the longer - distance dynamics involved in larger-@xmath4 systems within the eft @xcite , which is considerably simpler than doing so directly within lqcd .",
    "most lqcd results so far concern binding energies , but reactions convey much more information and will command increasing attention in the years to come .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which also summarizes the progress in this field , volume artifacts are more pronounced .",
    "eft quite naturally accounts for scattering states , and allows bound states and scattering to be treated on equal footing .",
    "here we elaborate on the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath3 and extend , for the first time , lqcd predictions to reactions involving nuclei . as an example",
    ", we consider neutron - deuteron ( nd ) scattering at low energies , where the two @xmath5-wave channels  with total spin @xmath6 ( quartet ) and @xmath7 ( doublet )  are most important .",
    "the noise - to - signal rate in lqcd also increases with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "results obtained with unphysical @xmath2 can , in principle , be extrapolated to the physical point in a systematic way using chiral effective field theory ( @xmath8eft ) , as long as pion masses are within the radius of convergence of the latter . from @xmath8eft with up to one nucleon",
    " that is , chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath8pt )  one obtains the @xmath2 dependence of , for example , the average pion mass ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , and of the nucleon ( @xmath9 ) and delta ( @xmath10 ) masses @xcite . the @xmath2 dependence of some few - nucleon observables has also been estimated @xcite , but unfortunately significant uncertainties still exist due to subtleties in the proper accounting of renormalization - group ( rg ) invariance in this non - perturbative context @xcite .",
    "the average pion mass @xmath0 is commonly used as a measure for the detuned value of the average quark mass . at present ,",
    "lqcd can be carried out in the meson and single - hadron sector down to values of @xmath0 close to physical , where the low - lying mass spectrum is reproduced within theoretical error bars ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a status report ) .",
    "comparison with lqcd data suggests that @xmath8pt  converges for pion masses no larger than about 500 mev @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the quark masses employed in current nuclear lqcd are likely beyond reach of @xmath8eft .    as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and elaborated here , the eft that describes existing light - nuclear lqcd data need not include pions explicitly .",
    "in fact , it has been understood for over fifteen years that even at the physical pion mass light nuclei are well described by pionless eft ( ) , an eft with non - relativistic nucleons interacting through contact forces with an increasing number of derivatives  each with a strength parameter or `` low - energy constant '' ( lec )  which contribute at increasing orders . in two - nucleon scattering ,",
    "reproduces @xcite the effective range expansion ( ere ) : scattering lengths at leading order ( lo ) , effective ranges at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , _ etc . _",
    "it thus also gives two - nucleon binding momenta in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 with corresponding accuracy .",
    "more importantly ,  offers a consistent extension of the ere to other systems @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath5-wave nd scattering in the quartet channel can be very accurately postdicted @xcite once the two - nucleon lecs have been fixed in the two - nucleon system . in the doublet channel , in contrast",
    ", rg invariance requires that the three - body force with no derivatives appear already at lo , with isospin - symmetric corrections starting beyond nlo @xcite .",
    "current evidence from the rg in the four - body system suggests that there is no four - body force up to nlo @xcite .",
    "the existence of a single three - body parameter up to nlo , which determines the three- and higher - body spectra , leads to many correlations among few - body observables at fixed two - body input .",
    "examples are the so - called phillips @xcite and tjon @xcite lines obtained in plots of the doublet nd scattering length @xcite and alpha - particle binding energy @xcite as functions of the triton binding energy .",
    "higher partial waves in three - nucleon scattering @xcite , four - nucleon scattering @xcite , and even @xmath13li @xcite can also be reasonably well described in . we will show that an analogous approach to describe light nuclei is equally useful at larger @xmath0 . using higher - than - physical @xmath2 not only increases @xmath0 , but also changes the nucleon mass @xmath9 and the masses of all other hadrons .",
    "we will argue on the basis of scales inferred from lqcd data that nucleons are sufficient for momenta up to @xmath0 , with neither explicit pions nor other baryons .",
    "whether it is indeed @xmath0 ( instead of , say , @xmath14 ) that determines the convergence rate of the theory used here is the subject of an upcoming investigation . at each value of @xmath0",
    "a pionless eft exists with specific values of the lecs ; we refer to  with varying @xmath0 as  in the following . until nuclear lqcd calculations are extended to include time - reversal and isospin violation , @xmath0 is the only qcd parameter determining nuclear properties .",
    "existing data at @xmath15 @xcite and 510 @xcite mev give @xmath3 binding energies that are much larger than in the real world and increase with the pion mass .",
    "the dineutron is bound , which could signal qualitative new features in lattice worlds .",
    "an obvious question is the extent to which properties of  survive in , where all scales change .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the binding energies of nuclei with @xmath16 were studied in lo  using as input the lqcd data for dineutron , deuteron and triton / helion at @xmath17mev @xcite .",
    "the alpha - particle binding energy provided a consistency check between  and lqcd data , and the @xmath18 binding energies obtained with   can be viewed as an extrapolation of lqcd . here , we extend   to the @xmath19mev lqcd data @xcite and to a broader range of observables including scattering amplitudes .",
    "the methods of  have for some time been deployed in the study of reactions directly on the lattice @xcite .",
    "both two - nucleon elastic scattering @xcite and neutron radiative capture on the proton @xcite have been considered directly on the lattice .",
    "our strategy is , instead , to analyze reactions outside the lattice box with  once its lecs have been determined from binding energies at lo and , eventually , also two - nucleon scattering observables at nlo .",
    "we exploit the dramatic advances in the development of the so - called _ ab initio _ methods that have taken place in nuclear physics over the same period in which  was formulated .",
    "in particular , here we employ the effective - interaction hyperspherical - harmonic ( eihh ) method @xcite , and the refined resonating - group ( @xmath20gm ) method @xcite .",
    "although these methods have been developed for traditional nuclear potentials , they can be adapted to pionless eft , as already done for  in the eihh @xcite and  in the @xmath20gm  @xcite .",
    "thus , we show that  remains useful in nuclear systems with @xmath21 and extrapolate lqcd data to observables that might not be as easily obtained in the lattice .",
    "this is analogous to the use of  correlations @xcite to infer values of poorly measured observables in the real world .",
    "if and when scattering observables are determined directly on the lattice , our predictions will be a further test of the consistency between  and lqcd , establishing the validity of a theory with only contact interactions over a range of @xmath0 from 140  mev up to 805  mev .",
    "such a consistency would provide a benchmark for the extension of this method to the less - understood @xmath8eft , once lqcd data reaches sufficiently small pion masses .",
    "we summarize the article as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_peft ] we discuss the degrees of freedom and breakdown scale of  for @xmath0 up to @xmath22 mev . still in sec .",
    "[ sec_peft ] , we present the lo hamiltonian and the regulator we use in calculations , which employ the computational tools introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec_tool ] : the eihh and @xmath20gm  methods . in sec .",
    "[ sec_calib ] , we determine the lo lecs from the lqcd data for @xmath23 in the alternate reality assessed via lqcd at various @xmath0 . with the hamiltonian thus calibrated , we calculate in sec .",
    "[ sec_res ] the alpha - particle binding energy , establish the heavy pion phillips and tjon lines , and predict the doublet and quartet neutron - deuteron scattering lengths @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec_conc ] the procedure is analogous to the development of  over the last decades , namely , a calibration of a small set of parameters to data in order , first , to obtain predictions of low - energy observables and , second , to explain correlations amongst them .",
    "at physical @xmath0 , pionless eft with nucleons as the sole degrees of freedom has proved useful for light nuclei in the low - momentum regime  see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and ref .",
    "@xcite for a pedagogical introduction .",
    "its organizational scheme ( `` power counting '' ) is based on two basic scales : the breakdown scale @xmath26 estimated as @xmath0 and an unnaturally small scale @xmath27 related to the inverse of the two - nucleon scattering lengths @xmath28 in the singlet / triplet channels .    for external relative momenta @xmath29 ,",
    "the deuteron and the virtual singlet bound state are the only singularities of the two - body scattering amplitude .",
    "all mesons and excited baryons are short - range effects .",
    "the amplitude from a lagrangian built of derivative contact operators made of nucleon fields can be matched to all orders of the ere . matching the lo amplitude to the ere results in a @xmath30 scaling of the non - derivative four - nucleon contact term .",
    "as the scattering lengths @xmath31 are large relative to the pion range @xmath32@xmath0  for both nn @xmath5-wave channels , a refined power counting is required @xcite that goes beyond naive dimensional analysis . of course , care has to be taken that the necessary regularization and the inclusion of higher - order contributions do not introduce poles within the radius of convergence .",
    "as long as those singularities are beyond the pion threshold , @xmath0 ,  converges for two - nucleon processes at momenta @xmath33 , including the @xmath11 ( deuteron ) and @xmath12 poles @xcite . in lo",
    "the two lecs @xmath34 suffice .    extending  to systems with more nucleons",
    "requires understanding how @xmath27 enters the lecs of multinucleon interactions .",
    "the fact that the non - derivative six - nucleon contact interaction is needed to define the eft at lo @xcite implies its lec scales as @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , the apparent lack of similar rg enhancements in other contact interactions suggests they appear only in higher orders .",
    "as  is applied beyond the deuteron , one needs to account for effects of the coulomb force among protons .",
    "the importance of coulomb effects is characterized by a ratio @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "although crucial for very low - energy proton - proton @xcite and proton - nucleus scattering , the coulomb interaction should be subleading in relatively deep ground states such as helion and alpha particle , where binding momenta are much larger than @xmath38 .    at lo , the  lagrangian can be written as    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a bi - spinor in both spin and isospin spaces , and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are the spin ( isospin ) pauli matrices , the index @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) running over spin ( isospin ) vector components of the projection operators on the spin singlet ( triplet ) state .",
    "higher orders contain terms with more derivatives and/or nucleon fields , including those necessary to ensure lorentz invariance ( in a @xmath45 expansion ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly ,  seems to converge for triton and helion @xcite , and even for the more - bound alpha particle @xcite . at the physical point ,  is useful even at lo to explain features like correlations amongst three - body observables ( the phillips line ) and between three- and four - body data ( the tjon line ) , with just the neutron - proton scattering lengths @xmath46 as input . with an additional condition which conventionally fixes either the triton binding energy @xmath47 or the neutron - deuteron doublet scattering length @xmath24 , a few four - nucleon observables",
    "e.g. _ , the binding energy of @xmath48he @xcite , and the neutron - triton and proton - helion scattering lengths  @xcite  have been found to agree with data within the expected uncertainty margin .",
    "the only exception so far seems to be the resonance location in the @xmath49 neutron - triton channel , which was found to be cutoff , and thus renormalization - scheme dependent  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this pathology is unknown .",
    "lo results for @xmath13li @xcite do not allow conclusions about the range in @xmath4 where  converges .",
    "with the usefulness at physical @xmath0  thus established , we follow an analogous approach at heavier @xmath2 . available lattice data  @xcite identifies the pion , still , as the lightest meson and the delta as the lowest excited state of the nucleon",
    ". however , the ratios between the nucleon , pion , and delta masses change , see table  [ tab.scales ] .",
    "also , nuclei become increasingly more bound .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as expected , the @xmath50 correlation has a positive slope for any pion mass . for each correlation band , we define the slope with a linear regression through the @xmath51 pairs predicted with  for all cutoff values which are within data uncertainty ( gray areas ) only . at physical @xmath0 ,",
    "our calculation yields a smaller slope ( @xmath52 ) than ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath53 ) . with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the slope is found to decrease , @xmath54 for @xmath0=510  mev and @xmath0=805  mev . in other words ,",
    "the ratio @xmath55 _ does _ change with @xmath0 , consistent with the lattice extractions , as shown in table  [ tab_res_4 ] .",
    "since in obtaining the tjon line the three - body force is being varied , the structure of the line ( slope , curvature , intercept ) must depend on the two - nucleon interactions .",
    "indeed , from the ratios listed in table  [ tab_res_4 ] we infer that whatever leads to the different ratios between the deeper two - nucleon state  recall that for unphysical masses , the interaction in the @xmath12 channel sustains a bound state , see table  [ tab.scales ]  and the triton is not the main factor behind the change in the slope of the tjon line . as for the phillips line ,",
    "the structure of the tjon line depends on both pieces of two - nucleon input .",
    "for example , in fig",
    ".  [ fig_tjon_slope ] , we demonstrate the sensitivity of the slope of the tjon line with respect to the pole in the spin - singlet two - nucleon amplitude . the triplet binding energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , the deuteron was held fixed to the lattice central value at @xmath0=510  mev , @xmath56mev .",
    "three cases are shown for @xmath57 , corresponding to different calibrations of @xmath58 , the lec controlling the channel : _",
    "i ) _ a singlet neutron - proton state with binding energy of approximately @xmath59mev , _",
    "i.e. _ , the deuteron energy ; _ ii ) _ a shallow bound singlet state of @xmath60mev ; and _ iii ) _ an unbound singlet state . within the considered range for @xmath47 a linear regression to the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath47",
    "is appropriate .",
    "when the singlet two - nucleon state is very close to threshold , the slope is found maximal , @xmath62 ( red dashed line in fig .  [ fig_tjon_slope ] ) . if the interaction is tuned away from this critical point , either to produce no bound singlet ( red dotted line ) , or a state with identical binding energy to the triplet ( red solid line ) , the slope parameter decreases .",
    "navely , one might have expected a monotonic dependence of the slope on the strength of the two - body attraction .",
    "a larger two - body attraction requires a more repulsive three - body force to fix the triton .",
    "the contribution of this extra repulsion should be stronger in the four - particle system and hence the latter should not be as deeply bound .",
    "the non - monotonicity found above remains to be explained in a more general context taking into account the possibility of a four - body efimov effect mentioned at the end of sec .",
    "[ doublet_section ] .",
    "we have adapted pionless effective field theory , , to describe lqcd data at unphysical pion masses , dubbing it .",
    "for the first time predictions were made for a nuclear reaction , nucleon - deuteron scattering , in lattice worlds where the pion mass is @xmath63 and @xmath64 mev .",
    "furthermore , the phillips and tjon correlations were obtained at these high pion masses with leading - order uncertainties of similar size and thus offer no indication of a significantly different convergence rate of the respective eft expansions .",
    "the alpha - particle binding energy was found in good agreement with direct lattice measurements , which reassures us of the applicability of .",
    "it also strengthens confidence in the lqcd results @xcite themselves , despite the apparent subtlety in identifying energy plateaus in the data .",
    "our work thus suggests that  applies to light nuclei independently of the exact lqcd data used as input .",
    "the calculations presented here could be repeated if those values change or if new values of the pion mass are explored . while this manuscript was being written ,",
    "new data have appeared for @xmath65 mev @xcite , which do not quite fit with the trend of increasing binding with pion mass but show a pattern of dependence on @xmath4 similar to the one found at higher pion masses @xcite .",
    "mev . from eq .",
    "[ anddere ] we then expect @xmath66 fm with a correction from the effective range of perhaps 40% . alas , in this lattice world , too , the large lattice errors do not yet allow firm conclusions about the two - body halo character of triton . ]",
    "more problematic is that another lattice collaboration @xcite does not find bound states over a wide range of pion masses . because the latter lattice data are processed through an ( unobservable ) potential , uncontrolled errors are introduced",
    "still , it is prudent to consider the specific numbers available from lqcd so far as illustrative only , and focus instead on the qualitative insights they bring into nuclear physics @xcite .    while much of the underlying structure of light nuclei seems to remain the same at unphysical pion mass , existing lqcd data give some hints of subtle changes . in the studied lattice worlds , the triton and alpha - particle binding energies are larger than in the real world , but their ratios to the deuteron binding energy become smaller .",
    "in contrast to the quartet neutron - deuteron channel , where we detected no qualitative changes , the accidental zero of the doublet @xmath67 matrix that exists for physical pion mass near threshold seems to disappear .",
    "it is replaced by effective - range parameters that suggest a more prominent neutron - deuteron halo character for the triton .",
    "lqcd data with smaller errors , and at other values of the pion mass , would allow firmer conclusions about the organization of nucleons in the triton and its implications for the alpha particle .",
    "in an upcoming project , nlo calculations will assess the convergence rate and breakdown scale of the eft .",
    "they will also reduce some of the uncertainties in the extrapolation of lqcd data . in the longer term , the application of  to systems with more than four nucleons could guide the lattice effort to the relevant few - body observables to be measured in order to pin down additional lecs needed to understand nuclear structure .",
