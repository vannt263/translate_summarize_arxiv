    "in machine learning , signal processing and intelligent data analysis , data to analyze and adaptive systems parameters are oftentimes organized as vectors or matrices whose entries satisfy non - linear constraints",
    ". exemplary cases of interest and related applications are summarized below :    * symmetric positive - definite matrices find a wide range of applications .",
    "for instance : analysis of deformation @xcite , image analysis @xcite , statistical analysis of diffusion tensor data in medicine @xcite , automatic and intelligent control @xcite , pattern recognition @xcite , speech emotion classification @xcite as well as design and analysis of wireless cognitive dynamic systems @xcite ; * calculation of the center of mass of lie - group - valued and manifold - valued data collections @xcite ; * several applications deal with special orthogonal group connection patterns like , for instance : invariant visual perception @xcite , modeling of dna chains @xcite , automatic object pose estimation @xcite , distributed consensus optimization among agents @xcite , study of plate tectonics @xcite , blind source separation and independent component analysis @xcite , curve subdivision in nonlinear spaces @xcite ; * there is a number of signal / data processing algorithms that learn parameter - vectors on the unit - hypersphere for applications such as blind channel deconvolution @xcite , one - unit independent component analysis @xcite , robust constrained beamforming @xcite and data classification by linear discrimination based on non - gaussianity discovery @xcite ; * stiefel - manifold - based algorithms have become increasingly popular in the scientific literature , with applications to optimal linear data compression , noise reduction and signal representation by principal / minor component analysis and principal / minor subspace decomposition @xcite , smart sensor arrays @xcite , direction of arrival estimation @xcite , linear programming @xcite , electronic structures computation within local density approximation ( e.g.  for understanding the thermodynamics of bulk materials , the structure and dynamics of surfaces and the nature of point - defects in crystals ) @xcite , factor analysis in psychometric @xcite ; * non - compact manifolds play a role in signal / data processing and modeling .",
    "a prominent example is the real symplectic group , whose known applications range from quantum computing @xcite to control of beam systems in particle accelerators @xcite , from computational ophthalmology @xcite to vibration analysis @xcite and control theory @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that non - compact manifolds are better framed as pseudo - riemannian manifolds rather than riemannian - manifolds @xcite .",
    "( the case of pseudo - riemannian manifolds is not considered within the present manuscript , though . )",
    "the above - mentioned cases may be framed as manifold - valued data analysis .",
    "a problem of practical impact is the visualization of such high - dimensional data .",
    "whenever the dimension of a manifold exceeds the number @xmath0 , direct visualization is impossible . in applications ,",
    "the dimension of the manifolds that the data belong to is much higher than three .    a possible solution to the visualization problem is provided by multidimensional scaling ( mds ) .",
    "multidimensional scaling is a numerical technique whose goal is to find out a low - dimensional representation of high - dimensional abstract objects suitable for graphical representation .",
    "the aim of multidimensional scaling is to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining their proximity properties .",
    "the aim of the present manuscript is to suggest the use of multidimensional scaling as a tool to visualize manifold - valued elements .",
    "such a tool is intended as a support for testing and evaluating signal processing and machine learning algorithms insisting on manifolds .",
    "as mds computes a set of coordinate vectors ( in @xmath1 or @xmath2 , for visualization purpose ) whose distribution reflects a pattern of proximity , a key point in visualization is the possibility to compute distances among objects on a manifold .",
    "for this reason , the present manuscript deals with riemannian manifolds .",
    "the section  [ sec2 ] of the present manuscript briefly reviews metric notions of riemannian manifolds and the basic theory of mds ( as well as details on its implementation ) .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] shows numerical examples about high - dimensional manifold - valued data visualization .",
    "the present section reviews some metric notions of smooth manifolds and recalls the way that multidimensional scaling works , its fundamental properties and implementation details .",
    "let the dataspace of interest be denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "it is supposed to be a riemannian manifold .",
    "its tangent space at point @xmath4 is denoted as @xmath5 . on a euclidean space @xmath6 ,",
    "the distance between two points @xmath7 may be measured as @xmath8 , where symbol @xmath9 denotes the @xmath10-norm .",
    "such a distance is indeed the length of a straight line connecting endpoints @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "such a notion of distance may be extended to a generic riemannian manifold via the notion of geodesic arcs ( which generalize straight lines ) and arc length on manifolds .",
    "a riemannian manifold is equipped by a symmetric , positive - definite inner product . given any pair of tangent vectors @xmath13 , their inner product is denoted by : @xmath14 let @xmath15\\rightarrow\\bbbx$ ] denote a smooth curve on the manifold @xmath3 such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the length of the curve @xmath18 is given by : @xmath19 given arbitrary @xmath4 and @xmath20 , the curve @xmath21\\rightarrow\\bbbx$ ] of shortest length is termed geodesic .",
    "normal parametrization is assumed here , namely the quantity @xmath22 keeps constant for every @xmath23 $ ] . such minimal length , namely @xmath24 ,",
    "is termed _",
    "geodesic distance _ between endpoints , namely between points @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the riemannian distance between endpoints is denoted by : @xmath27 because of normal parametrization , it holds : @xmath28 the above setting may be extended to include pseudo - riemannian manifolds .",
    "also , more general metric spaces may be taken into account , although this exceeds the scope of the present paper .",

    "one of the purposes of multidimensional scaling @xcite is to provide a visual representation of the pattern of proximities among a set of high - dimensional objects . in this instance",
    ", mds finds a set of vectors in the two - dimensional or three - dimensional euclidean space such that the matrix of euclidean distances among them corresponds  as closely as possible  to some function of the objects proximity matrix according to a criterion function termed _",
    "stress_.    formally ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a high - dimensional riemannian manifold with distance function @xmath37 and let @xmath38 be a given collection of @xmath39 elements of @xmath3 .",
    "the aim of mds is to determine a collection of @xmath39 euclidean coordinate - vectors @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , with @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) that replicates the pattern of proximities among the elements @xmath44 .",
    "this may be achieved by minimizing the kruskal stress function that may be written  for a generic riemannian manifold  as : @xmath45 where symbol @xmath9 denotes euclidean norm .",
    "alternatively , the sammon stress function @xcite may be used to measure the discrepancy between the proximity pattern of the original data and the proximity pattern of their low - dimensional versions .",
    "the sammon stress function may be written  for a generic riemannian manifold  as : @xmath46 the sammon stress function differs from the kruskal stress function in that the former emphasizes the relevance of distances that were originally small .",
    "indeed , the kruskal and the sammon stress functions may be unified by the weighted stress function : @xmath47 where the quantities @xmath48 denote weights and @xmath49 denotes a normalization constant . in summary :    * * kruskal stress function * : @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "* * sammon stress function * : @xmath52 , @xmath53 . * * dwyer - koren - marriott stress function * : in @xcite , the weighting scheme @xmath54 and @xmath50 are proposed .",
    "the correspondence @xmath55 induced by multidimensional scaling is not unique .",
    "in fact , if @xmath40 is a minimizer set of the stress function , for a given dimensionality reduction problem , @xmath56 is a constant displacement vector and @xmath57 is a @xmath58-dimensional rotation , also @xmath59 is a minimizer set .    multidimensional",
    "scaling may be used as a proximity / similarity visualization tool for high - dimensional data as it computes two - dimensional or three - dimensional vectors @xmath41 , corresponding to the original elements @xmath60 , that captures the fundamental information about mutual distances .",
    "the axes corresponding to the coordinates of the vectors @xmath61 referred to as ` fictitious coordinates ' , do not possess any physical meaning , in general .",
    "all that matters in an mds map are the proximity properties .",
    "_ on a mds - based visualization corresponding to a non - zero stress , the distances among objects are imperfect representations of the relationships among original data : the greater the stress , the greater the distortion .",
    "_    a key observation in the implementation of multidimensional scaling is that , rather than optimizing the actual stress function ( [ wstress ] ) , it is more computationally convenient to optimize a quadratic majorization of it @xcite .",
    "the following details on optimization of a majorizing function are drawn from @xcite .",
    "define the matrix @xmath62 as follows : @xmath63 moreover , given a collection of @xmath39 vectors @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , define the matrix @xmath66 as : @xmath67 to ease the notation , define matrix @xmath68 , whose rows coincide with the @xmath39 coordinate - vectors @xmath69 and matrix @xmath70 , whose rows coincide with the @xmath39 coordinate - vectors @xmath71 .",
    "the stress function ( [ wstress ] ) is bounded from above by the quadratic form @xmath72 defined as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the @xmath75 column of the matrix @xmath76 and @xmath77 denotes the @xmath75 column of the matrix @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "it holds @xmath80 with equality holding when @xmath81 . in order to iteratively",
    "solve the optimization problem of minimizing the criterion ( [ wstress ] ) , one may use the following scheme : @xmath82 it is immediate to verify that the optimization problem of minimizing the criterion ( [ optprob ] ) is equivalent to @xmath58 independent optimization problems , one for each axis .",
    "consequently , the optimization problem ( [ optprob ] ) may be reduced to the solution of @xmath58 quadratic problems of the kind : @xmath83 as the matrix @xmath84 is positive semi - definite , each of the above problem has only global minima .",
    "moreover , note that the matrix @xmath84 is constant across the @xmath58 optimization problems . in order to iteratively",
    "solve the quadratic optimization problem : @xmath85 one may use the following gradient steepest descent algorithm with line search @xcite given in @xcite is incorrect of a factor @xmath10 .",
    "] : @xmath86 as the matrix @xmath84 is semi - definite , it is rank - deficient . as a consequence ,",
    "the optimization problem ( [ qopt ] ) may not be solved in closed form and does not admit a unique solution .      as mentioned , multidimensional scaling is a method for embedding a general distance matrix into a low dimensional euclidean space , used both as a pre - processing step as well as a visualization tool .",
    "there are also applications where the target space , rather than being a euclidean space , is a smooth manifold .",
    "in particular , _ spherical mds _ is the problem of embedding a matrix of distances onto a ( low - dimensional ) sphere .",
    "spherical mds has applications in texture mapping , image analysis as well as dimensionality reduction for finite dimensional distributions .",
    "a spherical dimensionality reduction method may have considerable impact in domains that represent data as histograms or distributions , such as in document processing and speech recognition @xcite .",
    "an algorithmic framework for spherical multidimensional scaling has recently been described in @xcite .",
    "the present section aims at illustrating the behavior of the mds - based manifold - valued elements visualization tool . in all the following examples , the stress function proposed in @xcite",
    "is made use of .",
    "the first example aims at making the reader acquainted with the purpose of multidimensional scaling .",
    "it concerns the famous experiment with city - distances : the distance pattern among @xmath87 cities inputs the mds algorithm which computes the coordinates of @xmath87 bi - dimensional points as shown in the figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "the figure shows that the mds optimization algorithm tends to minimize the stress which indeed is a measure of discrepancy between the pattern of proximity among cities ( @xmath88 distances shown on the upper - right panel ) and the pattern of proximity of the coordinate vectors ( @xmath89 distances shown on the lower - right panel ) . as an example , los angeles and san francisco are close to each other and far from new york and the computed set of coordinate - vectors reflect this fact .",
    "the following two ( toy ) examples of mds maps concern a distribution of random points in @xmath1 visualized on @xmath1 . as the minimum distance problem ( [ wstress ] )",
    "does not possess an unique solution , it is not reasonable to expect that a mds map @xmath90 is necessarily an identity .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows a result obtained with initial guess just slightly randomly shifted with respect to the actual points . in this case , the computed coordinate - points and the actual points coincide .",
    "he same hold true for the @xmath91 matrices of actual and computed distances .",
    "the same experiment was repeated with a random initial guess : figure  [ fig2 ] shows that , although the set of coordinate - points replicate the distance pattern of the actual points , their locations are seemingly unrelated with those of the actual points .",
    "however , points that are actually close to each other ( for example , points marked as @xmath0 and @xmath87 ) keep close to each other in the computed representation .",
    "a further example concerns the bi - dimensional visualization of a distribution of points on a three - dimensional unit sphere .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the actual points on a three - dimensional spherical surface , labeled for clarity .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows a obtained result .",
    "the points that are close to each other on the sphere ( for example , points @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) are close to each other on the bi - dimensional plane too .",
    "the mds - based visualization tool may be profitably used to inspect the trajectory of the manifold - valued state of a signal processing algorithm .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] refers to the trajectory of a non - negative independent component analysis ( nnica ) algorithm @xcite which learns on @xmath94 .",
    "every time - step of the algorithm generates a @xmath95 orthogonal matrix with @xmath96-determinant that may be parameterized with no less than @xmath97 angles , whose visualization ` as is ' is impossible .",
    "the present visualization by multidimensional scaling is based on a map @xmath98 .",
    "the nnica algorithm run through @xmath99 time - steps , down - sampled to @xmath100 for visual tidiness ( initial point labeled as ` 1 ' , final point labeled as ` 20 ' ) .",
    "the succession of points clearly evidences a convergent adaptation trajectory .",
    "the aim of the present contribution was to suggest the use of multidimensional scaling , a well - known dimensionality reduction technique , as a visualization tool for manifold - valued data .",
    "visualization tools are useful in signal processing and machine learning as they help inspecting the distribution of high - dimensional vectors and matrices .",
    "the mds - based visualization tool suggested in the present paper captures the pattern of proximity among high - dimensional manifold - valued elements and computes a set of @xmath10-dimensional or @xmath0-dimensional vectors that retain the same pattern of proximity .",
