    "<S> dynamical scaling in a two - dimensional lattice model of chaotic maps , in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath0 , is numerically studied . </S>",
    "<S> the model here proposed is equivalent to a conserved ising model with couplings which fluctuate over the same time scale as spin moves . </S>",
    "<S> when couplings fluctuations and thermal fluctuations are both important , this model does not belong to the class of universality of a langevin equation known as model b ; the scaling exponents are continuously varying with @xmath0 and depend on the map used . </S>",
    "<S> the universal behavior of model b is recovered when thermal fluctuations are dominant .    </S>",
    "<S> the kinetics of phase separation as a system is quenched below its ordering temperature is the subject of much current research @xcite . in the dynamical scaling regime </S>",
    "<S> the ordering process is characterized by a single time dependent length @xmath1 representing the average domain size @xcite ; the growth exponent @xmath2 usually does not depend on the dimensionality of the system nor on the final temperature of the quenching . in most models with non - conserved order parameter @xmath3 , while in scalar models with conserved order parameters @xmath4 @xcite . a new exponent @xmath5 has been recently introduced by derrida et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with the hope to better characterize the process of phase separation : it is related to the persistence probability @xmath6 defined as the probability that the local order parameter at a given point has never changed since the initial time ; tipically one finds @xmath7 @xcite .    in a recent paper phase separation mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> have been investigated in the framework of coupled chaotic lattices @xcite , reaction - diffusion systems in which chaotic maps are coupled diffusively @xcite . in the strong coupling regime </S>",
    "<S> these models exhibit nontrivial collective behavior , i.e. long - range order emerging out of local chaos . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite the one - body probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of local ( continuous ) variables had two disjoint supports ; this allowed the unambiguous definition of ising spin variables . </S>",
    "<S> starting from uncorrelated initial conditions , for large coupling values , complete phase ordering was observed ; due to the deterministic nature of the system , the corresponding ising spin system was at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> both the domain size @xmath8 and the persistence @xmath6 showed scaling behavior and the exponents @xmath2 and @xmath5 were found to vary continuously with parameters , at odds with traditional models . </S>",
    "<S> _ normal _ phase ordering behavior , corresponding to the time dependent ginzburg - landau equation , was recovered in a continuous space limit of the model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest that the phase ordering properties of multiphase coupled chaotic lattices are different from those of most models studied traditionally . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting , therefore , to investigate the nonuniversality of scaling exponents in _ other _ systems of chaotic maps .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically study the dynamical scaling in a lattice model of chaotic maps such that the corresponding ising spin model conserves the order parameter . by assuming the system to be in contact with a thermal bath </S>",
    "<S> , we also study the competition between the autonomous fluctuations of couplings and thermal fluctuations .    on each site @xmath9 of a two dimensional square lattice , consider a dynamical system described by the variables @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which evolve according to the following map : @xmath12 , \\label{eq : flusso1}\\ ] ]    @xmath13 , \\label{eq : flusso2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ; @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this map has been studied in @xcite in the frame of chaotic neural networks ; for a suitable choice of the parameters , it has two symmetric chaotic attractors , one with @xmath19 and the other with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> hence an ising spin @xmath21 $ ] can be associated to each dynamical system . at each discrete timestep @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> we assume the following dynamics , consisting of two stages : firstly all the maps are iterated . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , all pairs of nearest neighboring maps are sequentially swapped with the following exchange probability @xcite : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the inverse temperature , @xmath25 is the change in energy that would occur if the maps were exchanged , and the configurational energy is defined as @xmath26 , the sum being over all the nearest neighboring pairs . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that this dynamics conserves the spin magnetization @xmath27 ; by writing @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , we observe that this model is equivalent to a conserved ising model with couplings which fluctuate over the same time scale as spin moves . to study the phase ordering process </S>",
    "<S> , uncorrelated initial conditions were generated as follows : one half of the sites were chosen at random and the corresponding values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 were assigned according to the invariant distribution of the chaotic attractor with @xmath19 , while the other sites were similarly assigned values with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> large lattices ( up to @xmath32 sites ) with periodic boundary conditions were used ; the persistence @xmath6 and the domain size @xmath8 were measured . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 was estimated by the condition @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the two point correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the persistence @xmath6 was measured as the proportion of sites which have not changed @xmath35 from the initial time . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath8 and @xmath6 were averaged over many different samples of initial conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss our results . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 typical configurations of the ordering system , at various times , are shown : the morphology of growing domains is similar to those in the conserved ising model @xcite . at zero temperature ( @xmath36 ) </S>",
    "<S> the system coarsens and exhibits scaling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we measure @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a the time evolution of @xmath8 is shown , while in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b the time evolution of the persistence @xmath6 is shown . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the conserved ising model with spin - exchange dynamics ( which is recovered by suppressing couplings fluctuations in the present model ) does not coarsen at zero temperature @xcite . in the case of finite temperature , we find that the growth exponent varies continuously with @xmath24 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we plot our measures of @xmath2 for some values of the temperature @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that @xmath2 increases monotonically with @xmath0 and reaches the value @xmath43 at @xmath44 ; it remains constant until @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the range @xmath46 $ ] , thermal fluctuations dominate over couplings fluctuations and the system belongs to the class of universality of a langevin equation known as model b @xcite , which describes the standard conserved ising model ( when bulk diffusion dominate over surface diffusion @xcite ) . at high temperature ( @xmath47 ) </S>",
    "<S> the system does not order and @xmath8 tends to a constant after a little transient ( @xmath48 ) . for temperatures in the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 $ ] , our numerical plots of @xmath8 do not show a neat scaling behavior ( filled area in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) : probably , in the thermodynamic limit a critical value @xmath50 exists , in this range , separating the @xmath4 behavior from the @xmath51 one . further numerical simulations are needed to study the phase ordering properties of this system close to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the order of magnitude of @xmath50 here estimated is consistent with the critical coupling of the two - dimensional ising model ( @xmath52 ) if one approximates the average value of couplings as follows : @xmath53 , the average of @xmath54 being calculated over the invariant distribution of the chaotic attractor .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth stressing that simulations of the spin - exchange ising model , at low temperature , do not provide @xmath4 but a value in the range @xmath55 , because of corrections due to excess transport in interfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can not exclude that these effects , peculiar to spin - exchange dynamics , still play a role , at low temperature , in the present model . </S>",
    "<S> however , we simulated , at low temperatures , the spin - exchange ising model and , fitting the domain size with the power law form , we measured growth exponents differing from those measured in our model ( using the same ratio @xmath56 in the two models ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now we consider the scaling function . in the scaling regime </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function obeys the following scaling form @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that recently the universality of the scaling function @xmath58 , with respect to details of the system , has been questioned @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 the scaling collapse of the correlation function is depicted for three values of the temperature . at small @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function has a linear behavior ( porod s law ) @xmath60 ; we measure @xmath61 , independently of the temperature . on the other hand , at larger distances @xmath58 shows some dependence on the temperature ( see fig.4 ) : at the moment , we have no argument to explain this dependence . concerning the persistence exponent , at finite temperature we measure the block persistence @xmath62 , </S>",
    "<S> which , for a sufficiently large block , is much less affected by thermal corrections than @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that also @xmath5 depends on the temperature ; for example at @xmath63 , using @xmath64 blocks , we measure @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> .    we also simulated systems with different maps . </S>",
    "<S> we do not report here details and only quote the results . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , at fixed temperature , the scaling exponents depend on the map . changing the parameters in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 - 2 ) and fixing @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath66 , we measure , at zero temperature , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ; using the one - dimensional map of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , at zero temperature , we find @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in both these two cases , however , we verify that the @xmath2 exponent grows continuously with temperature and , when thermal fluctuations are dominant , @xmath2 is close to @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling function @xmath58 is found to be independent of the map at zero temperature .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have numerically studied the dynamical scaling in a lattice model of chaotic maps which is equivalent to a conserved ising model with fluctuating couplings , in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when couplings fluctuations and thermal fluctuations are both important , this model does not belong to the class of universality of model b : the scaling exponents are continuously varying with @xmath0 and depend on the map used . </S>",
    "<S> the universal behavior of model b is recovered when thermal fluctuations are dominant . </S>",
    "<S> our measures of the scaling function show some dependence on the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a similar variation of the scaling exponents with parameters was found in @xcite , where the ising models associated to the coupled map lattices were not conserving the order - parameter and at zero temperature : here we have confirmed this behavior in another class of chaotic map lattices , whose corresponding ising models are conserving the order parameter and in presence of thermal fluctuations .    finally , we observe that , on the long term , local chaos may be seen as bounded _ effective _ noise . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that a similar behavior might be found in the dynamical scaling of conserved coarsening systems in presence of multiplicative noise @xcite , i.e. external fluctuations of a control parameter in the system . </S>",
    "<S> further investigation , especially at the analytic level , is needed to clarify the origin of the nonuniversality here described . </S>"
