    "in physics , choosing an appropriate coordinate system can make the difference between a tractable problem and one that defies analytical study .",
    "in fluid dynamics , two main types of coordinates are used , each representing a natural setting in which to study fluid motion : the eulerian coordinates , also known as the laboratory frame , are time - independent and fixed in space ; in contrast , the lagrangian ( or material ) coordinates are constructed to move with fluid elements . in between these extremes , other types of coordinates",
    "are used , such as rotating coordinates in geophysical fluid dynamics .",
    "such coordinates usually have a nontrivial spatial and temporal dependence .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when dealing with moving surfaces : here the metric itself has intrinsic time dependence .",
    "this time dependence incorporates the strain imposed on a 2d surface flow as the surface deforms . to properly formulate fluid equations on thin films and other surfaces",
    ", one needs a _ covariant _ description , that is , a description of the building blocks of equations of motion  spatial and temporal derivatives  that obey tensorial transformation laws .",
    "there are other reasons than inherent deformation of the space to introduce a time - dependent , nontrivial metric .",
    "for instance , the advection - diffusion equation can have an anisotropic , time - dependent diffusion tensor , perhaps arising from some inhomogeneous turbulent process . in that case",
    ", it is advantageous to use the diffusion tensor as a metric , for then the characteristic directions of stretching , given by the eigenvectors of the metric tensor in lagrangian coordinates , correspond to directions of suppressed or enhanced diffusion associated with positive or negative lyapunov exponents , respectively  @xcite .",
    "local physical quantities can be viewed as tensors ( scalars , vectors , or higher - order tensors ) evaluated along fluid trajectories . for instance , we may be interested in how the temperature ( scalar ) of a fluid element varies along a trajectory , or how the magnetic field ( vector ) associated with a fluid element evolves .",
    "characterising the evolution of these tensors in complicated coordinates is again best done using some form of covariant time derivative , also called an _ objective _ time derivative .",
    "the covariant spatial derivative is a familiar tool of differential geometry  @xcite .",
    "the emphasis is usually on covariance under coordinate transformations of the full space - time . in fluid dynamics and general dynamical systems ,",
    "however , the time coordinate is not included in the metric ( though the metric components may depend on time ) , and the required covariance is less restrictive : we seek covariance under time - dependent transformations of the coordinates , but the new time is the same as the old and does not depend on the coordinates .",
    "time derivatives lead to non - tensorial terms because of time - dependent basis vectors  the same reason that ordinary derivatives are not covariant .",
    "there are many ways of choosing a covariant time derivative .",
    "the most familiar is the _ convective _ derivative introduced by oldroyd  @xcite in formulating rheological equations of state .",
    "this derivative was then used by scriven  @xcite to develop a theory of fluid motion on an interface .",
    "the convective derivative of a tensor is essentially its lie derivative along the velocity vector . in spite of its economical elegance , the convective derivative has drawbacks .",
    "firstly , unlike the usual covariant spatial derivative , it is not _ compatible _ with the metric tensor .",
    "a compatible operator vanishes when acting on the metric .",
    "because the covariant derivative also has the leibniz property , compatibility allows the raising and lowering of indices `` through '' the operator .",
    "this is convenient for some applications  @xcite , and implies that the equation of motion for a contravariant tensor has the same form as the covariant one .",
    "a second drawback of the convective derivative is that it involves gradients of the velocity , and so is not _",
    "directional_. the commutator of the convective derivative and the spatial derivative thus involves _ second _ derivatives of the velocity , requiring it to be at least of class  @xmath0 .",
    "a second common type of derivative is the _ corotational _ or _",
    "jaumann _ derivative ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , and references therein ) , where the local vorticity of the flow is incorporated into the derivative operator .",
    "the corotational derivative is compatible with the metric , but like the convective derivative it depends on gradients of the velocity .",
    "the third type of derivative we discuss is a new , time - dependent version of the usual _ directional _ derivative along a curve used to define parallel transport  @xcite .",
    "the curve here is the actual trajectory of a fluid particle , with tangent vector given by the eulerian velocity field .",
    "the directional derivative does not depend on gradients of the velocity field .",
    "the concept of time - dependent parallel transport can be introduced using this derivative , and is equivalent to a covariant description of advection without stretching .",
    "a directional derivative was introduced in the context of fluid motion by truesdell  @xcite , but it does not allow for time - dependence in the coordinates or metric .",
    "( truesdell calls it the _ material _ derivative because of its connexion to fluid elements . )    in this paper , we present a unified derivation of these different types of covariant time derivatives .",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to eulerian and lagrangian coordinates , as this obscures the general covariance of the theory : both these descriptions lack certain terms that vanish because of the special nature of the coordinates . from a dynamical system defined in some eulerian frame , we transform to",
    "general time - dependent coordinates .",
    "we then find a transformation law between two time - dependent frames with no explicit reference to the eulerian coordinates .",
    "the eulerian velocity of the flow is not a tensor , but the move to general coordinates allows the identification of a _ velocity tensor _ that transforms appropriately ( section  [ sec : timedep ] ) .",
    "we also derive a time evolution equation for the jacobian matrix of a coordinate transformation between two arbitrary time - independent frames .",
    "this time evolution equation facilitates the construction of the covariant time derivative in section  [ sec : covtderiv ] . after a discussion of the rate - of - straintensor in section  [ sec : deftens ] , we present in section  [ sec:3derivs ] the three types of covariant time derivatives mentioned above : convective , corotational , and directional .",
    "section  [ sec : timecurv ] addresses a fundamental issue when dealing with generalised coordinates : the problem of commuting derivatives . in manipulating fluid equations",
    "it is often necessary to commute the order of time and space derivation . when commuting two covariant spatial derivatives , the riemann curvature tensor must be taken into account .",
    "similarly , when commuting a covariant time derivative with a spatial derivative , there arises a tensor we call the _ time - curvature_. this tensor vanishes for sufficiently simple time - dependence of the metric , and satisfies many properties similar to the riemann tensor .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will usually refer to the `` fluid , '' `` fluid elements , '' and `` velocity , '' but this is merely a useful concretion .",
    "the methods developed apply to general dynamical systems where the velocity is some arbitrary vector field defined on a manifold .",
    "the covariant time derivative still refers to the rate of change of tensors along the trajectory , but the tensors do not necessarily correspond to identifiable physical quantities .",
    "for example , the covariant time derivative is useful in fornmulating methods for finding lyapunov exponents on manifolds with nontrivial metrics  @xcite .",
    "[ sec : timedep ]    we consider the dynamical system on an  @xmath1-dimensional smooth manifold  @xmath2 , @xmath3 where the overdot indicates a time derivative and  @xmath4 is a differentiable vector field .",

    ", we assume the usual einstein convention of summing over repeated indices . we denote vectors expressed in the general coordinate basis  @xmath14 by the indices  @xmath15 .",

    "the explicit form of the relevant tensors is often fairly involved , but the advantage is that they can be evaluated in time - independent eulerian coordinates and then transformed to arbitrary coordinate systems using the usual tensorial transformation laws .    the covariance of the time derivatives is made explicit by using arbitrary time - dependent coordinates .",
    "the results for the eulerian coordinates  @xmath137 are recovered by setting  @xmath138 , and those for the lagrangian coordinates  @xmath139 by setting  @xmath80 .",
    "the introduction of the time - curvature tensor allows us to treat the temporal dependence of the metric tensor in a manner analogous to its spatial dependence . for simple time - dependence , the time - curvature vanishes , such as for the case of a time - independent metric multiplied by a time - dependent scalar . as for the ( spatial ) riemann curvature tensor ,",
    "the components of the time - curvature can be computed for a given metric , and then inserted whenever a temporal and spatial derivative need to be commuted .",
    "we have only addressed the _ kinematics _ of fluid motion .",
    "the dynamical equations relating the rate of change of quantities to the forces in play have not been discussed ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and depend on the specifics of the problem at hand . nevertheless , covariant time derivatives provide a powerful framework in which to formulate such dynamical equations .",
