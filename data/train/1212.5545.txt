    "complex networks have been actively studied in recent years @xcite . among extensive researches carried out on complex networks , percolation on various networks has played an important role in clarifying the interplay between network topology and critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "percolation on uncorrelated networks ( represented by the configuration model @xcite ) is well described by the local tree approximation ; there is a phase transition between the non - percolating phase and the percolating phase just as in euclidean lattice systems , but its critical exponents depend crucially on the heterogeneity of the degree distribution of the network @xcite . on the other hand , several authors @xcite have reported that percolation on networks constructed with certain growth rules exhibits quite a different phase transition from that of uncorrelated networks and euclidean lattices , referred to as an infinite order transition with inverted berezinskii  kosterlitz ",

    "percolation on nags ( with one end ) exhibits the following three phases depending on the value of @xmath1 : the non - percolating phase ( @xmath12 ) , the critical phase ( @xmath13 ) , where infinitely many infinite clusters exist , and the percolating phase ( @xmath14 ) . here",

    "the coincidence between @xmath127 and @xmath112 for @xmath140 means that the partial ordering ( in the sense that the largest cluster is @xmath15 with @xmath141 ) in this region is essentially governed by the shortcuts . because boettcher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered renormalization of the connecting probability of consecutive points of the backbones , we would expect their first critical probability @xmath117 to be the probability above which the backbones become relevant .",
    "thus , we expect that there is a transition between critical phases , in the sense that the fractal exponent jumps , implying a qualitative change in the criticality , while it is very difficult to judge whether such a transition exists or not by finite size simulations .",
    "such a jump in the fractal exponent has already been observed in site - bond percolation on the decorated ( 2,2)-flower @xcite .",
    "in addition , our numerical result shows that @xmath127 reaches unity smoothly at @xmath118 .",
    "this indicates that the phase transition to the percolating phase is discontinuous , similarly as in @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the cluster size distribution function , @xmath142 , below @xmath118 .",
    "figure [ fig - ns](a ) shows @xmath142 for several values of @xmath1 with @xmath143 . in the critical phase ,",
    "we expect a power law for @xmath142 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 and a corresponding scaling form : @xmath146 where the scaling function @xmath147 behaves as @xmath148 we tested this scaling for @xmath149 and @xmath150 and obtained excellent collapses ( fig.[fig - ns](b ) ) .",
    "we would also expect that @xmath9 to be fat - tailed for @xmath151 because @xmath142 for the skeletons perfectly obeys eqs.([eq - ns ] ) and ( [ eq - tau ] ) via eq.([eq - nsscaling ] ) for @xmath152 ( not shown ) , and @xmath9 is broader when we add the backbones to the skeletons , i.e. , for the original hn - np .",
