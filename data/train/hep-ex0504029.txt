    "macro was a large area multipurpose underground detector @xcite designed to search for rare events and rare phenomena in the penetrating cosmic radiation @xcite .",
    "it was located in hall b of the gran sasso lab at an average rock overburden of 3700 m.w.e . ; it started data taking with part of the apparatus in @xmath5 ; it was completed in @xmath6 and run in its final configuration until the end of 2000 .",
    "the detector had dimensions of @xmath7 and provided a total acceptance to an isotropic flux of particles of @xmath8 ; vertically it was divided into a lower part , which contained 10 horizontal layers of streamer tubes , 7 of rock absorbers and 2 layers of liquid scintillators , and an upper part which contained the electronics and was covered by 1 layer of scintillators and 4 layers of streamer tubes .",
    "the sides were covered with 1 vertical layer of scintillators and 6 of limited streamer tubes .",
    "macro detected upgoing @xmath9 s via charged current interactions , @xmath10 ; upgoing muons were identified with the streamer tube system ( for tracking ) and the scintillator system ( for time - of - flight ) .",
    "the events measured and expected for the 3 measured topologies , deviate from monte carlo ( mc ) expectations without oscillations ; these deviations and the @xmath2 distribution point to the same @xmath11 oscillation scenario @xcite-@xcite .",
    "here we also present the results of a preliminary search for possible lorentz invariance violation contributions to atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the measured upthroughgoing muon data of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a were compared with different mc simulations . in the past",
    "we used the @xmath12 flux computed by the bartol96 group @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the predicted flux was estimated at @xmath13 ; this is mainly a scale error that does not change the shape of the angular distribution .",
    "a similar mc ( honda95)@xcite was used by the superk collaboration ( sk ) @xcite .",
    "recently new improved mc predictions for neutrino fluxes were made available by the honda ( hkkm01 ) @xcite and fluka @xcite groups .",
    "they include three dimensional calculations of hadron production and decay and of neutrino interactions , improved hadronic model and new fits of the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "the two mc yield predictions for the non oscillated and oscillated @xmath14 fluxes equal to within few % @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the angular distributions for oscillated and non oscillated bartol96 , new fluka and new honda fluxes are the same to within few % .",
    "the absolute values of our data are higher than those predicted by the new fluka and honda mc , fig .",
    "a similar situation is found in the new sk data @xcite .",
    "the l3c and bess cosmic ray results presented at this workshop @xcite lead to @xmath12 fluxes in better agreement with bartol96 and honda95 predictions .",
    "the evidence for neutrino oscillations is mainly due to the shape of the angular distribution and this is the same in all mcs",
    ". also the ratios of the medium to high energy measurements and of the two low energy data samples are mc independent .",
    "our data suggest that the fluka normalization should be raised by @xmath15 at @xmath16 and by @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "the _ upthroughgoing muons _ come from @xmath19 interactions in the rock below the detector ; muons with @xmath20 cross the whole detector .",
    "the corresponding @xmath19 s have a median energy of 50 gev . many systematic effects and backgrounds",

    "+ _ oscillation probability as a function of the ratio @xmath2_. @xmath29 was estimated by measuring the muon energy , @xmath30 , by means of muon multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) in the rock absorbers in the lower macro .",

    "the distribution of the ratio @xmath32 obtained by this analysis is plotted in fig . [ fig3 ] versus @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the _ internal upgoing ( iu ) muons _ come from @xmath0 gev @xmath34 s interacting in the lower apparatus .",

    "[ fig2]b is the dashed line with a @xmath35 systematic band .",

    "the 2 types of events ( not shown in fig .",

    "in the past , in order to determine the oscillation parameters , we made fits to the shape of the upthroughgoing muon zenith distribution and to the absolute flux compared to the bartol96 mc . the other data were only used to verify the consistency and make checks .",
    "the result was @xmath38 ev@xmath22 and maximal mixing @xcite @xcite .",
    "later , also the @xmath2 distribution was used @xcite .    in order to reduce the effects of systematic uncertainties in the mc we recently used the following three independent ratios @xcite and we checked that fluka",

    ", we assumed mass - induced @xmath12 oscillations as the leading mechanism and liv as a sub - dominant effect @xcite . in this scenario one",
    "considers 2 flavor eigenstates , 2 mass eigenstates and 2 velocity eigenstates ( characterized by different maximum attainable velocities in the limit of infinite momentum ) . in a first analysis we considered the subsample of upthroughgoing @xmath36 s for which the energy was estimated via mcs and we used the ratio @xmath55 , where low and high are for events with reconstructed energies @xmath56 30 and @xmath57 130 gev ( average energies of 13 and 146 gev , respectively ) . in the analysis we fixed the neutrino mass oscillation parameters at @xmath58 and @xmath59 and performed a minimization with respect to the liv parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
