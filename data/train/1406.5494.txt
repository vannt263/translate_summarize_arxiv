    "the g - factors of the proton @xmath6 orbital @xmath160 and the experimental value of @xmath161 for neutron @xmath162 configuration were used @xcite to calculate this value .",

    "[ tac3](a ) , we plot the spin vs. @xmath148 values for this band and compare them with the calculated values .",
    "a reasonable agreement is observed before the band - crossing .",
    "the calculated results after the band - crossing deviates slightly from the experimental curve but the general trend is similar .",
    "it may be noted that the other possible configurations of this band are @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the former configuration can be obtained from the coupling of two - proton 5@xmath14 state with the 10@xmath14 odd - odd valence - particle state along with another two decoupled neutrons in @xmath7 orbital .",
    "the later configuration is similar to those of band b2 in @xmath16pb and of the mr band in @xmath176bi .",
    "however , the tac calculations for these bands are unable to reproduce the observed band for any of these configurations",
    ".    we may also note that the observation of a 6-qp mr band and its crossing with the 8-qp mr band is a very rare phenomenon , and this is only second such observation in this mass region , the first one being in @xmath0pb @xcite .",
    "a similar observation has also been made in the light mass region in @xmath177cd @xcite .",
    "since the band - head of b2 is at a lower energy than the band b1 , a 4-qp configuration of @xmath178 has been assumed .",
    "after the back - bending , it becomes a 6-qp configuration by breaking an additional neutron pair in @xmath130 .",
    "the 6-qp configuration for this band will then be @xmath179 .",

    "again , there is a very good agreement between the measured data and the calculated values .",
    "the band - crossing is also well reproduced .",
    "after the band - crossing at around 22@xmath151 , the experimental values follow the calculations for the 6-qp configuration and , there by , supporting the configurations assigned for this band both before and after the band - crossing .",
    "the calculated @xmath172 values for the 4-qp and the 6-qp configurations corresponding to the band b2 are shown in fig .  [ tac2](b ) .",
    "the decreasing values of @xmath172 strongly supports the mr nature of this band as well . as the lifetime measurements were not possible in the present experiment ,",
    "so it was not possible to compare the calculated @xmath172 values with measured data .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , two cross - over transitions have been observed in this band from the 20@xmath14 and 21@xmath14 states and the @xmath18 ratios were obtained for these two states from the intensities of the @xmath185 and the @xmath186 transitions ( assuming mixing ratio @xmath187 for the mr bands ) .",
    "the @xmath172 values can be derived from these measured ratios using the calculated values of @xmath188 .",
    "the @xmath172 values for the two states obtained in this way are plotted in fig .",
    "[ tac2](b ) for comparison and an excellent agreement is observed .",
    "we have also plotted the spin ( i ) vs. @xmath148 for the band b2 in fig .",
    "[ tac3](b ) and compared with the calculated values .",
    "reasonable agreement before and after the crossing supports the 4-qp and 6-qp configurations assigned for this band before and after the band - crossing .",
    "as the mr nature of the bands and their microscopic structure is well understood from the tac calculations , the bands b1 and b2 have been investigated in the frame work of a semiclassical model of magnetic rotation @xcite to get an idea about the particle - hole interaction strength .",
    "this calculation is based on a schematic model of the coupling of two long j vectors , ( * @xmath189 * and * @xmath190 * ) , corresponding to the proton and neutron blades .",
    "this aims at extracting the information on the effective interaction between the nucleons which are involved in the shears mechanism . in this model ,",
    "the shears angle ( @xmath191 ) , between the two j vectors , is an important variable which can be derived using the equation @xmath192 where , @xmath193 is the total angular momentum . for the proposed configuration of @xmath194 for the band b1 ,",
    "the @xmath195 and @xmath196 values are @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "hence , the band - head spin is calculated to be @xmath199 assuming perpendicular coupling between @xmath195 and @xmath196 ; which is in reasonably good agreement with the observed spin of the band - head . the maximum spin for this band can be calculated as @xmath200 in this model .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ tac1](a ) that in the tac calculations , the band - crossing ( between 6-qp and 8-qp bands ) takes place at around the similar spin value for this band , indicating that the semiclassical results are consistent with the tac calculations .    according to the prescription of macchiavelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the excitation energies of the states in shears bands correspond to the change in the potential energy because of the re - coupling of the angular momenta of the shears .",
    "the excitation energies of the states in the band with respect to the band - head energy can be written as : @xmath201 where , @xmath202 is the energy of the level with angular momentum i , @xmath203 is the corresponding shears angle as given in equation  [ sa ] , @xmath204 is the band - head energy and @xmath205 is the strength of the interaction between the blades of the shears .",
    "therefore , @xmath205 can be calculated by using the experimentally observed energy levels of the shears band .",
    "@xmath206 , obtained in this way for the band b1 , has been plotted as a function of @xmath191 in fig .",
    "@xmath205 has been extracted from this plot by a fit of equation  [ ve ] .",
    "the fitted curve is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath205 comes out to be 610 kev , leading to the interaction strength per particle - hole pair ( @xmath207 ) as about 122 kev considering that all the five possible particle - hole pairs in this configuration are contributing to the shears mechanism .",
    "this is somewhat less compared to a typical value of @xmath208 kev observed in the pb nuclei in this region @xcite .",
    "this possibly indicates that all the particle - hole pairs may not be contributing equally to the shears mechanism .",
    "a value of @xmath208 kev is obtained if it is considered that the proton particles and neutron holes in the high - j ( @xmath141 and @xmath138 ) orbitals are the only dominant contributors to the shears mechanism .",
    "similarly , for the proposed configuration of the band b2 , the @xmath195 and @xmath196 values are @xmath197 and @xmath209 , respectively , and therefore , the calculated minimum ( band - head ) and maximum spin values come out to be @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "the observed band - head spin is , again , in very good agreement for this band also .",
    "the maximum spin corresponding to this configuration matches well with the observed backbending and with the spin value of @xmath212 at which the 4-qp band crosses the 6-qp band in the tac calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ tac1](b ) ) .",
    "after the backbending , the band has a different configuration so , in the subsequent calculations of @xmath206 the values of @xmath191 were restricted up to the spin value of @xmath213 as shown in fig .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath205 from this plot comes out to be 865 kev , this leads to the interaction strength per particle - hole pair to be @xmath214 kev .",
    "this is in agreement with the typical values for this mass region .",
    "it may also be noted that the configuration of this band corresponds to proton - particle and neutron - holes in high - j @xmath141 and @xmath138 orbitals only and hence , all the three possible particle - hole pairs contribute to the shears mechanism .",
    "therefore , it supports the conjecture that the proton - particles and neutron - holes only in high - j orbitals have significant roles in forming mr bands by shears mechanism in this region .",
    "we have investigated the high - spin structure of the odd - odd nucleus @xmath0bi by producing them in fusion - evaporation reaction with @xmath215re target and a 112.5-mev beam of @xmath2o using the inga array .",
    "we have presented a new and much improved level scheme of this nucleus in this paper . the dco ratio and the polarization asymmetry measurements have also been performed to assign spins and parities of the levels .",
    "we have identified three band structures in this nucleus , labelled as bands b1 , b2 and b3 , which lie at high excitation energies . on the basis of a comparison with similar bands in neighboring nuclei and the tac calculations ,",
    "we conclude that the bands b1 and b2 have magnetic rotational character .",
    "one of the most significant findings of this work is the observation of the crossing of two mr bands in b1 as well as in b2 bands . in the band b1 ,",
    "the lower part of the band has a 6-qp configuration @xmath216 , which becomes a 8-qp configuration @xmath217 , after the band - crossing .",
    "both the parts are mr in nature .",
    "observation of such a crossing of two mr bands having large multi - quasiparticle configuration is a very rare finding and to the best of our knowledge , is only second such observation in this mass region .",
    "similarly , the band b2 also undergoes a band crossing of two mr bands from a 4-qp configuration @xmath155 to a 6-qp configuration @xmath179 .",
    "although the measurement of @xmath172 values are not available , the calculated @xmath172 values perfectly fit the expected behaviour of mr bands .",
    "it is , however , strongly suggested that such measurements be carried out in future .",
    "we have also used the semiclassical model for the configurations assigned to the bands b1 and b2 and have extracted the interaction strengths of the particle - hole pairs , which fits into the previously observed trend .",
    "we conclude that the high - j proton - particle and neutron - hole pairs alone make the dominant contribution to the shears mechanism .",
    "we also conclude that the band b3 has a pure shell model structure and is possibly not a mr band .",

    "<S> high - spin states in the doubly - odd @xmath0bi nucleus have been studied by using the @xmath1re(@xmath2o , xn ) reactions at the beam energy of 112.5 mev . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 coincidences , directional correlation ratio and integrated polarization asymmetry ratio were measured by using the inga array with 15 compton - suppressed clover hpge detectors . </S>",
    "<S> definite spins and parities were assigned to the observed levels . </S>",
    "<S> the high - spin structure is grouped into three bands ( b1 , b2 and b3 ) , of which two ( b1 and b2 ) exhibit the properties of magnetic rotation ( mr ) . </S>",
    "<S> tilted axis cranking calculations were carried out to explain the mr bands having large multi - quasiparticle ( qp ) configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results explain the bands b1 and b2 very nicely , confirming the shears mechanism and suggest a crossing of two mr bands in both the cases . </S>",
    "<S> the crossing is from 6-qp to 8-qp in band b1 and from 4-qp to 6-qp in band b2 , a very rare finding . </S>",
    "<S> a semiclassical model has also been used to obtain the particle - hole interaction strengths below the band - crossing for the bands b1 and b2 . </S>"
