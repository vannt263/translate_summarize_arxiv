    "the time variability of cosmic magnetic fields has always been an argument in favour of hydromagnetic dynamo action .",
    "its understanding is crucial for insights in the interior dynamics of stars and planets .",
    "the time dependence of convective dynamos is attributable to a non - stationary buoyancy flux as well as to a time dependent equilibration of the magnetic field .",
    "the latter is subject of the study presented here .",
    "how do dynamos saturate and in particular in which way is the saturation reflected in their time dependence ? in a general description ,",
    "the infinite growth of a magnetic field due to an appropriate motion of a conducting fluid is inhibited owing to the backreaction of the lorentz force on the flow ; the resulting changes in the flow cause a reduction of dynamo action .",
    "flows which are influenced by the lorentz force in this way are called saturated .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite as well as @xcite demonstrate that saturated flows may lead to exponential growth of the magnetic field in a corresponding kinematic calculation . despite the fact that the magnetic field is saturated in the full non - linear system",
    ", it can grow in a kinematic treatment , because both associated linearized stability problems are different .",
    "the flows taken from a saturated dynamo simulation and then used in a kinematic calculation need only quench the growth of the particular magnetic field found in the nonlinear problem and can in principle allow others to grow .",
    "as @xcite have pointed out there is at least one example , the benchmark dynamo case  1 @xcite , where the field taken from a saturated dynamo is also kinematically stable .    in this study",
    ", we show that there is in fact a whole class of saturated , chaotic , time - dependent dynamos for which the corresponding kinematic dynamo is stable . in order to assess kinematic stability  in the sense explained above",
    " we solve the mhd - equations for a boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell . at the same time",
    "we evolve a second passive tracer field using the induction equation .",
    "while the tracer field experiences the self - consistent velocity field at each time step it does not contribute to the lorentz force .",
    "this method has been used by @xcite for box simulations and a shell model and is closely related to the test - field method to determine mean - field coefficients @xcite .    within a sample of 20 models ,",
    "we identify two distinct dynamo regimes dependent on a modified rossby number @xcite in which the tracer field either grows exponentially or reaches a state aligned with the actual self - consistent magnetic field after an initial transition period .",
    "moreover , differences in the kinematic stability of the dynamos are linked to differences in their time variability : exclusively kinematically unstable dynamos in the high rossby number regime show polarity reversals of the axial dipole field .",
    "we attribute the complicated time behaviour of these models to an alternating growth of many competing dynamo modes . on the other hand",
    ", the eigenvalue computation suggests that dynamos with low rossby number are dominated by only one fundamental mode which is repeatedly quenched and rebuilt .",
    "all other modes in this case are clearly subcritical . in this sense ,",
    "dynamo models in the low rossby number regime , i.e. fast rotators , exhibit a simple time dependence and their time - variability consists of fluctuations about their critical state .",
    "we consider an electrically conducting boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell and solve the mhd - equations as given by @xcite and described in detail by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we compute the evolution of a passive tracer field with the help of a second induction equation @xmath0 while the tracer field , @xmath1 , experiences the self - consistent velocity field @xmath2 in each time step , it does not contribute to the lorentz force .",
    "hence it does not act on the velocity field and is `` passive '' in this sense .",
    "the initial conditions for the tracer field have been chosen arbitrarily with the help of a random number generator . moreover , for models 1015 , we added some random noise to the tracer field in each time step .",
    "this enables us to perturb the tracer field permanently and prevents it from becoming aligned with the actual , self - consistent field . in these simulations",
    ", we advance the tracer field for at least 10 magnetic diffusion times in order to test for kinematic stability .    according to the scaling we used ,",
    "the equations are governed by four parameters .",
    "these are the ekman number @xmath3 , the ( modified ) rayleigh number @xmath4 , the prandtl number @xmath5 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath6 . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath7 denotes the kinematic viscosity , @xmath8 the rotation rate , @xmath9 the shell width , @xmath10 the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath11 is the gravitational acceleration at the outer boundary , @xmath12 stands for the temperature difference between the inner and outer spherical boundaries , @xmath13 is the thermal and @xmath14 the magnetic diffusivity with the magnetic permeability @xmath15 and the electrical conductivity @xmath16 .",
    "all four parameters have been varied to build up a sample of 20 dynamo models , see table  1 .",
    "output parameters used here in order to interpret the results are the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath17 , the elsasser number , @xmath18 , and the rossby number , @xmath19 . in these expressions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote rms - values of the velocity and the magnetic field inside the shell , respectively , and @xmath22 is the density .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the definition of a local rossby number proposed by @xcite , @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the mean half wavelength of the flow and @xmath25 is the mean harmonic degree derived from the kinetic energy spectrum , @xmath26 the brackets in eq .",

    "stars denote non - reversing dynamos which are kinematically stable , whereas triangles represent dynamos which do reverse and are kinematically unstable .",
    "both regimes coincide with the dipolar and multipolar dynamo regimes identified by christensen and aubert ( 2006 ) .",
    "there is one example ( diamonds ) , model 15 , which undergoes a transition between both regimes .",
    "note that this example has a considerably lower relative dipole field strength in its second state . ]    within our 20 examples ( see table [ tab1 ] ) we find 5 dynamos which are kinematically unstable and 14 which are kinematically stable .",
    "one example ( model 15 ) belongs to both classes ; although in general unstable , the tracer field does not grow within certain periods of several magnetic diffusion times .",
    "note that all dynamos considered here operate in the so called strong field regime , i.e. the elsasser number is of order unity or larger .",
    "the equatorial symmetry is broken for most of the kinematically stable and all unstable models . except for model 1 , the quasi - steady benchmark dynamo @xcite ,",
    "all models exhibit highly time - dependent or even chaotic behaviour .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] for model 2 , the next simplest example to the benchmark dynamo .",
    "this dynamo appears to be chaotic , and as an experiment we performed two simulations starting from almost identical initial conditions ( the difference between two initial conditions is a small deflection of the magnetic dipole axis in the second run ) .",
    "the evolution from both initial conditions is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] where the magnetic energy densities can be seen to diverge rapidly with time .    , and the actual magnetic field , @xmath30 , versus time for model 8 ( dashed line ) and model 19 ( solid line ) . ]     where @xmath31 is the outer shell radius .",
    "note that the tracer field is completely aligned with the actual magnetic field .",
    "both components are normalised due to their maxima and minima .",
    "therefore the greyscale coding varies from -1 , white , to + 1 , black , and the contour lines correspond to @xmath32 . following contour plots",

    "the regimes of kinematically stable and unstable dynamos can be clearly distinguished by the modified rossby number ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , @xmath29 .",
    "models with low rossby number are kinematically stable whereas the tracer field grows exponentially for dynamos in the high rossby number regime .",
    "the transition between both regimes occurs at @xmath33 .",
    "there are two further properties related to both regimes which deserve mentioning .",
    "all dynamos we found to be kinematically stable are dipolar and do not show any polarity reversals , while dynamos in the second regime are multipolar and do reverse .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . here",
    ", the relative dipole field strength , @xmath34 , on the outer shell boundary is plotted versus the modified rossby number , @xmath29 ; @xmath34 is defined as the time - average ratio of the dipole field strength to the field strength in harmonic degrees 1 to 12 .",
    "both regimes visible in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] coincide with those identified earlier by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] compares the magnetic energy densities of the tracer field for a kinematically stable ( model 8) and a kinematically unstable dynamo ( model 19 ) , varying with time .",
    "while the tracer field grows rapidly after an initial transient phase in the latter case , it reaches a state aligned with the actual field if the dynamo is kinematically stable .",
    "then , the energy density of the tracer field normalised with the energy density of the actual self - consistent field approaches a constant level which depends only on the initial conditions .",
    "this is also confirmed by looking at the corresponding field configurations .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] displays the radial component of the tracer field for model 8 , which differs from the actual field only by an overall scale factor .",
    "therefore , only one contour plot is given .",
    "on the other hand , although they have similar spatial scales , both field components are clearly not aligned but very different for model 19 ( see fig .  [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,^,>,<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     model 15 is in general kinematically unstable but also exhibits periods of several magnetic diffusion times in which the tracer field stays stable .",
    "according to its local rossby number , @xmath35 , it is located close to the boundry between both dynamo regimes and undergoes transitions from one to the other .",
    "( dashed line which runs out of the figure at roughly 2.3 magnetic diffusion times ) .",
    "as soon as the dynamo reverses it becomes kinematically unstable . ]",
    "we could detect transitions from a kinematically stable to an unstable state ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4a ] ) and vice versa .",
    "as long as the tracer field remains stable , the tilt angle of the dipole axis fluctuates about the actual polarity state .",
    "however , when the tracer field becomes unstable , also the polarity of the dipole field starts to reverse .",
    "this coincidence is observed for transitions in both directions , i.e. the tilt angle of the dipole axis also stabilises when model 15 becomes intermittently stable . while the magnetic field is quite dipolar with @xmath36 for periods in which the polarity and the tracer field are stable the relative dipole field strength decreases drastically to @xmath37 otherwise .",
    "the strong connection of field morphology , time dependence and saturation is not only present separately in several models but manifests itself in the time variation of a single dynamo model , too .",
    "the existence of kinematically unstable dynamos was expected @xcite .",
    "the finding of a class of kinematically stable but yet time - dependent or even chaotic dynamos , however , needs some further explanation .",
    "the lack of growing modes for these models already suggests that almost all field configurations for the tracer field are decaying , except the one aligned with the actual , self - consistent field .",
    "but this component of the tracer field is quenched by the saturated velocity field .",
    "thus , the tracer field follows the actual field with time , apart from a different , arbitrary amplitude due to the linearity of the induction equation .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by looking at the spectrum of the time and azimuthally averaged dynamo operator @xmath9 , @xmath38 with eigenmodes @xmath39 and eigenvalues @xmath40 . in this , the operator @xmath9 is defined as @xmath41 note that @xmath9 , also known as mean - field dynamo operator @xcite , contains the mean velocity field @xmath42 as well as the so called mean - field coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which are tensors of second and third rank , respectively .",
    "as noted by @xcite , these quantities appear inevitably as a consequence of averaging .",
    "they depend on the velocity field and the magnetic diffusivity of the considered dynamo model only and have been determined with the help of the test field method @xcite . a detailed discussion on the applicability of mean - field concepts to direct numerical simulations of rotating magnetoconvection and a ( quasi-)stationary dynamo is provided by @xcite . a similar discussion for time dependent dynamos is not given here but will be subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "a recent review on the test - field method and its applications has been given by @xcite .",
    "eigenvalues and eigenmodes of @xmath9 have been computed as reported by @xcite for model 2 . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] the radial components of the first three ( dipolar ) eigenmodes , @xmath39 , are displayed .",
    "all modes decay exponentially ; this had to be expected for kinematically stable dynamos ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "however , the decay rates are given here in units of @xmath45 , in which the molecular diffusivity @xmath46 is about 30 times smaller than the turbulent one inferred from components of @xmath44 .",
    "thus , @xmath47 is much larger than one effective diffusion time and the first , fundamental , eigenmode is indeed close to its critical state . due to a noticable gap in decay rates after the fundamental mode , @xmath48",
    ", this is not equally true for the subsequent eigenmodes .",
    "they are much more diffusive , thus leaving the fundamental mode as the preferred eigenstate of the dynamo .",
    "hence , the time dependence of model 2 may be understood in parts as a fluctuation of the fundamental mode about its critical state .     of the time",
    "averaged dynamo operator for model 2 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath49 and @xmath50 in units of @xmath45 .",
    "note the huge drop in decay rates after @xmath51 . ]",
    "the dominance of the first eigenstate is also revealed by a decomposition of the actual , time - dependent magnetic field of model 2 in a set of eigenmodes @xmath39 of @xmath9 , @xmath52 the time - dependent and in general complex mode coefficients @xmath53 have been computed as @xmath54 in which @xmath55 denotes the adjoint of the current @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the vector potential of the actual , time - dependent field , @xmath58 .",
    "the integration is carried out over the whole fluid domain @xmath59 . for a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) we refer to @xcite and @xcite",
    ".     already contributes 75% up to 85% to the total amount and its time variability reflects much of the time dependence of the axisymmetric magnetic field . ]    in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] the energy contribution of the fundamental eigenmode @xmath60 is compared with the total axisymmetric magnetic energy density .",
    "the fundamental eigenmode contributes at least 75% up to 85% to the total amount , revealing again its permanent dominance throughout the simulation .",
    "the equilibration process for model 2 has been studied earlier by @xcite , too .",
    "they found that in regions with high magnetic energy density , the lorentz force simply reduces locally the flow velocity without changing the overall pattern of convection .",
    "they investigated possible changes in the velocity , if the magnetic field and thus the lorentz force is arbitrarily reduced at some instant in time and then recovers towards its equilibration value .",
    "the kinematic effects relevant for dynamo action identified by them , an @xmath61-effect from helicity in the columnar convection and an anti-@xmath62 effect from the mean azimuthal flow , were present in the same proportions close and far from equilibrium conditions of the magnetic field .",
    "their finding is supported by the study presented here .",
    "saturation may reduce the amplitudes of @xmath61 and thus the growth rates of the eigenstates of the related dynamo operator , but does not change their relative order .",
    "therefore , the preferred eigenstate stays the same throughout the simulation .",
    "this is clear as there is a large gap between the growth rate of the fundamental eigenmode of the time - averaged dynamo operator @xmath9 and all other eigenmodes , as mentioned above .",
    "so far we only analysed model 2 in detail . here",
    "the velocity field is nearly symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane and the magnetic field belongs to the dipolar family .",
    "contributions of quadrupolar type are not present . in a more complicated example with broken equatorial symmetry , we expect the fundamental quadrupolar mode to be excited . although its growth rate will be smaller than the one for the fundamental dipolar mode and probably subcritical , it is typically of the same order . in such a case a clear dominance of only one fundamental dipolar mode can no longer be deduced from the spectrum of the time - averaged dynamo operator @xmath9 , and a second , quadrupolar mode may become important .    for the models in the high rossby number regime the findings of @xcite apply .",
    "these models act kinematically as dynamos and the dynamo operator @xmath9 possesses in general growing eigenmodes .",
    "a kinematic treatment of these dynamos does not reveal their actual time dependence .",
    "however , the results presented here suggest that the regime of dipolar dynamos identified by @xcite is kinematically stable . for these models ,",
    "the quenching of any magnetic field is fully captured in the velocity field and a kinematic treatment may indeed reproduce their actual time - dependence .",
    "models of this dynamical regime are applicable to planetary dynamos and probably also to dynamos of fast rotating stars @xcite , thus covering a large range of magnetic reynolds numbers . hence , an attempt to explain the kinematic stability of these models due to a magnetic reynolds number which is close to its critical value fails .",
    "we emphasise again that the transition between both regimes is governed by the local rossby number @xmath29 and not by @xmath63 , as can be already seen from table  [ tab1 ] . in the low rossby number regime",
    ", the rotational constraint leads to columnar structured flows , dipolar magnetic fields and finally to a rather simple time dependence , although these models operate in general far away from the dynamo threshold at @xmath64 .",
    "dipolar dynamo models which show occasionally reversals are located close to the regime boundary in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , with @xmath65 .",
    "they resemble the geodynamo in many respects and are therefore of particular interest . explaining polarity reversals of an otherwise predominantly dipolar field , @xcite suggest that the geodynamo crosses the boundary towards the multipolar dynamo regime from time to time . with the help of scaling laws derived from numerical models ,",
    "they indeed succeed in predicting a local rossby number of @xmath66 for the earth s core . adopting this viewpoint",
    "we link the occurence of geomagnetic reversals to a change in the saturation process .",
    "the quenching of a previously dipolar field may result in the preference of different , higher order modes if inertia gains importance in comparison to the coriolis force , and the dynamo undergoes an excursion into the kinematically unstable regime .",
    "subsequently the dipole field is built up again , but it may have either polarity .",
    "a computation of eigenmodes and a mode decomposition similar to ( [ eq:7a ] ) for model 15 seems to be a promising approach to confirm this picture .",
    "note that from the viewpoint we take here , the existence of dipolar , stable periods for model 15 demands more explanation than the fact that it reverses .",
    "however , whether inertia is indeed as important for the geodynamo as it is for present dynamo models is under debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the assumption of @xmath66 for the earth s core leads to a characteristic length scale of only a few hundred meters , on which the magnetic field would be highly diffusive @xcite .",
    "fast rotating dynamos , characterised by a low rossby number , are kinematically stable . within this regime , a saturated velocity field taken from dynamo simulations does not lead to exponential growth of the magnetic field in a corresponding kinematic calculation .",
    "hence , saturation may be understood as a quality of the velocity field , only . for these dynamos , saturation results in the unchanged preference of a fundamental eigenstate , whereas different eigenmodes may supersede each other if inertia gains importance .",
    "this difference in the saturation process involves differences in the morphology of the magnetic field and its time dependence .",
    "kinematically stable dynamos are dipolar and exhibit a rather simple time variability , which may be interpreted as the fluctuation of the fundamental mode about its critical state .",
    "kinematically unstable dynamos are much more complicated .",
    "the alternating growth of various modes leads to a multipolar field morphology and polarity reversals of the dipole field appear as a natural consequence .",
