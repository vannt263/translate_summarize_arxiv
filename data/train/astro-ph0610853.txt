    "at birth , protostars are surrounded by circumstellar ( cs ) gaseous disks that become the natural sites for planet formation . an important constraint for any planet formation scenario",
    "is the timescale available during which planet formation can occur , before the cs disks dissipate .",
    "several studies have shown that near and mid - infrared excess flux , indicative of inner cs disks , rapidly declines with 50% of low - mass stars losing their very inner dust disk within @xmath6  myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the disappearance of inner disks seems to coincide with the end of accretion , suggesting that both dust and gas disappear on similar timescales @xcite .",
    "the dissipation of the primordial disks in which gas planets could form seems to be completed by @xmath7  myr .",
    "however , cs disk evolution is currently poorly - constrained within the @xmath8  510  myr age range due to the lack of observationally well - characterized systems .    to study the influence of environment and stellar properties on disk dissipation timescales , nearby young stellar cluster provide ideal targets as many of their stellar properties ,",
    "their ages and environment can be well constrained . the nearby , coeval @xmath1  chamaeleontis cluster at a distance of 97 pc and an isochronal age of @xmath0  myr @xcite is an excellent laboratory to study disk evolution .",
    "the cluster consists of three early - type systems , and 15 low - mass stars with stellar types ranging from k6 to m5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a substantial fraction of the @xmath1  cha members have an near - ir excess .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite who observed all late - type members at wavelengths between 3.68  @xmath9 m with the infrared array camera ( irac ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ , detecting disks around 40% of the stars .",
    "given the age of the @xmath1  cha cluster , this large disk fraction seems inconsistent with the @xmath86  myr maximum lifetime of inner disks derived by @xcite from @xmath10-band observations of younger clusters .",
    "this argues against a single dissipation timescale in all environments and/or for all disk radii .    in this paper , we will employ the longer wavelength capabilities of the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ spitzer _ to firmly establish the census of disks for the 15 low - mass k- and m - type members of the cluster .",
    "we then determine and discuss the influence of binarity on the cs disk dispersal timescales , and on the specific angular momentum distribution of the cluster members .",
    "we obtained @xmath11 @xmath9 m low - resolution ( @xmath12 ) spectra of the @xmath1 cha cluster members with the irs spectrograph .",
    "integration times were set such that stellar photospheres could be detected with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath13 across most of the irs bandpass .",
    "our spectra are based on the droopres products processed through the s13.2.0 version of the _ spitzer _ data pipeline .",
    "partially based on the smart software package @xcite , our data was further processed using spectral extraction tools developed for the `` formation and evolution of planetary systems '' ( feps ) _ spitzer _ science legacy team .",
    "the spectra were extracted using a 6.0 pixel and 5.0 pixel fixed - width aperture in the spatial dimension for the observations with the first order of the short- ( @xmath14 @xmath9 m ) and the long - wavelength ( @xmath15 @xmath9 m ) modules , respectively .",
    "the background was subtracted using associated pairs of imaged spectra from the two nodded positions along the slit , also eliminating stray light contamination and anomalous dark currents .",
    "pixels flagged by the data pipeline as being `` bad '' were replaced with a value interpolated from an 8 pixel perimeter surrounding the errant pixel .",
    "the low - level fringing at wavelengths @xmath16  @xmath9 m was removed using the irsfinge package @xcite .",
    "the spectra are calibrated using a spectral response function derived from irs spectra and cohen stellar models for a suite of calibrators provided by the _",
    "science centre . to remove any effect of pointing offsets",
    ", we matched orders based on the point spread function of the irs instrument , correcting for possible flux losses .",
    "the relative errors between spectral points within one order are dominated by the noise on each individual point and not by the calibration .",
    "we estimate a relative flux calibration across an order of @xmath17  % and an absolute calibration error between orders / modules of @xmath18  % .",
    "our observations are sensitive to cs disks with substantial inner gaps not radiating at wavelengths @xmath19 @xmath9 m as covered by irac .",
    "the maximum wavelength of 35 @xmath9 m of our spectra corresponds to a blackbody temperature of @xmath890 k. assuming a @xmath20 dependency for the dust opacity , and a typical stellar temperature and radius of 3500 k and 1 @xmath21 , respectively , dust grains attain a temperature of 90 k at a radius of about 25 au from the central star .",
    "therefore our observations should be sensitive to cs disks with a maximum inner gap radius of about this value .",
    "additionally , for circumbinary disks , @xcite argue that the inner edge of circumbinary disks will have a tidal truncation radius of @xmath22 . given a maximum detection radius of about 25 au",
    ", we should be able to detect circumbinary disks in any @xmath1 cha binary systems with separations @xmath23 au .    in fig .",
    "[ spectra.fig ] we show three representative irs spectra .",
    "these examples demonstrate the excellent agreement between the irs and irac data at 8 @xmath9 m , both independently calibrated , and between the irs spectra and the optical photometry - scaled stellar models for diskless systems . from inspection of the spectra , we add recx 3 and 4 to the disk census , meaning that 8 out of 15 ( or about 50  % ) of low - mass @xmath1 cha stars have irs - detected disks .",

    "table [ table1.tab ] lists the 13 @xmath9 m ( @xmath27 ) and 33 @xmath9 m ( @xmath28 ) fluxes , and @xmath26 colors for all the late - type @xmath1 cha stars .",
    "our detection limits at 13 @xmath9 m and 33 @xmath9 m are @xmath29 and 0.3 mjy , respectively , showing the remarkable sensitivity of the irs instrument .",
    "the six diskless late - type @xmath1 cha stars with 33  @xmath9 m detections of the stellar photosphere have a @xmath26 color of @xmath30 ( 1@xmath31 ) .",
    "in contrast , the weakest disks detected in the transitional disk objects recx 3 and 4 lack 13  @xmath9 m excesses and have a @xmath26 color of @xmath32 , while those stars with protoplanetary disks displaying significant disk excesses at both 13 and 33  @xmath9 m have @xmath26 colors exceeding @xmath33 .",
    "among the 15 late - type stars , six are binaries with projected separations @xmath34  au ( column  2 , table  1 ) .",

    "of the eight detected disks , all but one are associated with single stars . with nine single stars in total ,",
    "about 80% have a cs disk .",
    "of the six known or suspected close binaries , only recx 9ab has a cs disk associated with it .",
    "the presence of this disk , likely a circumprimary disk , was already inferred from ground - based @xmath10-band photometry @xcite , h@xmath43 spectroscopic measurements of disk accretion @xcite , and irac photometry @xcite .",
    "no circumbinary disks are detected .",
    "a non - parametric mann - whitney two - sample @xmath44-test indicates that the probability that the singles and binaries are drawn from the same parent sample is @xmath45 , i.e. cs disks are under - represented in @xmath1 cha binaries with @xmath46 significance .",
    "we surmise that the last `` remaining '' disk in a binary exists principally because the physical separation of recx  9ab greatly exceeds the projected @xmath36 au separation , given that no significant change in spatial separation or position angle was detected between the surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the disk around recx  9a , therefore , effectively follows that of a disk in a single star system .",
    "the @xmath26 color of the recx 9 disk suggests that the outer disk extends to at least 20 au .",
    "the presence of an extended disk in combination with a circumprimary tidal truncation radius of @xmath47 @xcite implies a physical binary separation @xmath48 au .",
    "if the evolution of recx  9 is treated as a single star then a @xmath44-test gives @xmath49 , indicating that the evolution of single stars or binaries with separations equal or larger than that of recx  9 is significantly different from the evolution of close binary systems .    to estimate a typical disk disappearance timescale",
    ", we assume a rectangular probability distribution for the disk to dissipate around a mean timescale @xmath50 and width @xmath51 .",
    "as constraints we assume that at @xmath52 myr all systems have disks , and that by @xmath53 myr ( the age of the @xmath54 pic moving group ) all disks have dissipated .",
    "we find for the binary and single star members , respectively , @xmath55 myr and @xmath56 myr . if for our widest binary system , recx 9ab , single star evolution is more applicable , the derived @xmath50 for disks in close binary systems could be even shorter",
    ".    @xcite analysed the rotational evolution of samples of solar - like pms stars .",
    "their key conclusion was that around half of pms stars lose significant surface angular momentum in the first @xmath57  myr owing to rotational coupling between star and disk . during this phase , spin - up of the star",
    "is prevented as it evolves towards lower luminosity , because angular momentum is transferred to the cs disk .",
    "the other half of pms stars evolve at almost constant surface angular momentum , having lost their disks within the first few million years .",
    "these two groups of pms stars are believed to evolve to form the slowly- and rapidly - rotating groups of young main sequence stars , respectively .",
    "we calculated the magnitude of the specific surface angular momentum @xmath58 ( surface angular momentum per unit mass ) for the 12 late - type cluster members with rotation periods and photometry from @xcite and precise spectral types from @xcite .",
    "we adopt dwarf temperature and bolometric correction scales to calculate stellar luminosity and radii , with compensation applied for companion stars within the binary systems based upon observed light and radial velocity ratios . for binaries , we assume the observed rotation period is associated with the primary star . in table",
    "[ table1.tab ] we express the derived @xmath58 values in solar units , where @xmath59 @xmath60s@xmath61 . in fig .",
    "[ sam.fig ] we plot the cluster s @xmath58 distribution for various groupings of cluster objects .",
    "we see that _ all _ the high-@xmath58 systems are the primaries of @xmath1 cha binary systems . with a mean @xmath62 for binary primaries ,",
    "this group differs significantly from the single stars with a mean @xmath63 .",
    "a @xmath44-test gives a probability that the single stars and primaries are drawn from the same parent sample of only @xmath64 .",
    "the comparison would have been even more extreme if we had not compensated for the presence of secondary stars . for uncorrected binaries having a mean @xmath65 ,",
    "the @xmath44-test gives a probability of @xmath66 .",
    "we thus provide novel empirical evidence for rotational disk locking , supporting models of star - disk magnetic coupling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we concur with @xcite that high-@xmath58 stars are freed from any form of locking mechanism . in the @xmath1 cha cluster ,",
    "none of the high-@xmath58 stars have cs disks .",
    "we additionally add the result that the high-@xmath58 tail in @xmath1 cha consists entirely of the primaries of binary stars .",
    "this again argues that disk lifetimes in binary systems are shorter than those in single star systems .",
    "the @xmath58 samples of @xcite are not corrected for binarity . from our results for the @xmath1 cha cluster",
    ", we surmise that the high-@xmath58 tail of their distributions are populated with , and possibly dominated by , diskless binary systems .",
    "the link between disk presence , angular momentum and binarity may have profound astrophysical importance in evaluating the time available for planet formation , as this is determined by the dissipation timescale of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the high angular momentum and paucity of disks in @xmath1 cha binaries indicates a characteristic disk lifetime considerably less than the cluster s age of @xmath0 myr .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath1 cha singles , where the high disk fraction implies that their disk evolutionary timescale is comparable to , or slightly greater than , the age of the cluster . using a simple statistical approach",
    ", we estimate a mean disk dispersion timescale of @xmath4 myr and @xmath5 myr for close binary and single star systems , respectively .",
    "our results suggest that the correct evaluation of the _ disk fraction _ in pms groups , and consequently the characteristic timescale for _ disk longevity _ during the pms phase , critically depends on knowledge of binarity within a given pms population .",
    "we can not rule out that disk dissipation timescales could also depend on stellar mass , as our sample only consists of late k- and m - type stars .",
    "also , the derived timescales depend upon the detection wavelength , reflecting that disk dissipation can have a radial dependence . however , even if we limit our detections to those stars with irac excesses , dissipation timescale for single stars only shortens by @xmath810 % to @xmath67 myr . in any case ,",
    "our results imply that the assumption of a single timescale for disk dissipation is not correct .",
    "the rapid decline of the disk fraction in the first few myr as inferred by several near- and mid - ir studies , could be dominated by the dissipation of disks in close binary systems .",
    "the slower dissipation of disks around single stars could be the explanation for the long - lived disks seen in older pms clusters such as @xmath1 cha .",
    "the strong tidal torques exerted on disks in close binary systems will have a negative impact on the efficiency of planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , while @xmath825 % of exo - planets are detected in binaries , no planets have been found in binaries with projected separations @xmath68 au @xcite , though at this point observational selection effects can not be ruled out .",
    "our results imply that in close binary systems the time available for planet formation is considerably shorter than in single star systems , which could severely inhibit the formation of planets .",
    "the apparent lack of planets in close binaries , therefore , might reflect the shorter disk dissipation timescale in binary systems .",
