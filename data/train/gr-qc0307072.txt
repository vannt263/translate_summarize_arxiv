    "theoretical work on gravitational lensing is traditionally done in a quasi - newtonian approximation formalism , see , e.g. , schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite or petters , levine and wambsganss @xcite , which is based , among other things , on the approximative assumptions that the gravitational field is weak and that the bending angles are small . under these assumptions ,",
    "lensing is described in terms of a `` lens equation '' that determines a `` lens map '' from a `` deflector plane '' to a `` source plane '' , thereby relating image positions on the observer s sky to source positions .",
    "although for all practical purposes up to now this formalism has proven to be very successful , there are two motivations for doing gravitational lens theory beyond the quasi - newtonian approximation .",
    "first , from a methodological point of view it is desirable to investigate qualitative features of lensing , such as criteria for multiple imaging or for the formation of einstein rings , in a formalism without approximations , as far as possible , to be sure that these features are not just reflections of the approximations .",
    "second , lensing phenomena where strong gravitational fields and large bending angles are involved are no longer as far away from observability as they have been a few years ago . in particular , the discovery that there is a black hole at the center of our galaxy @xcite , and probably at the center of most galaxies , has brought the matter of lensing in strong gravitational fields with large bending angles closer to practical astrophysical interest .",
    "if a light ray comes sufficiently close to a black hole , the bending angle is not small ; in principle , it may even become arbitrarily large , corresponding to the light ray making arbitrarily many turns around the black hole . unboundedly large bending angles also occur e.g. with wormholes ; the latter are more exotic than black holes , in the sense that up to now there is no clear evidence for their existence , but nonetheless considered as hypothetical candidates for lensing by many authors .",
    "if one wants to drop the assumptions of weak fields and small angles , gravitational lensing has to be based on the lightlike geodesic equation in a general - relativistic spacetime , without approximations . in this paper",
    "we will discuss this issue for the special case of a spherically symmetric and static spacetime . in view of applications , this includes spherical non - rotating stars and black holes , and also more exotic objects such as wormholes and monopoles with the desired symmetries .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that in this case lensing without approximations can be studied , quite conveniently , in terms of a lens equation that is not less explicit than the lens equation of the quasi - newtonian formalism .",
    "lensing without weak - field or small - angle approximations was pioneered by darwin @xcite and by atkinson @xcite .",
    "whereas darwin s work is restricted to the schwarzschild spacetime throughout , atkinson derives all relevant formulas for an unspecified spherically symmetric and static spacetime before specializing to the schwarzschild spacetime in schwarzschild and in isotropic coordinates .",
    "all important features of schwarzschild lensing are clearly explained in both papers . in particular , they discuss the occurrence of infinitely many images , corresponding to light rays making arbitrarily many turns around the center and coming closer and closer to the light sphere at @xmath2 .",
    "however , they do not derive anything like a lens equation .",
    "the notion of a lens equation without weak - field or small - angle approximations was brought forward much later by frittelli and newman @xcite .",
    "it is based on the idea of parametrizing the light cone of an arbitrary observation event in a particular way . for a general discussion of this idea and of the resulting `` exact gravitational lens map '' in arbitrary spacetimes the reader may consult ehlers , frittelli and newman @xcite or perlick @xcite . here",
    "we are interested only in the special case of a spherically symmetric and static spacetime .",
    "then the geodesic equation is completely integrable and the exact lens equation of frittelli and newman can be written quite explicitly .",
    "one can evaluate this equation from the spacetime perspective , as has been demonstrated by frittelli , kling and newman @xcite for the case of the schwarzschild spacetime , thereby getting a good idea of the geometry of the light cone . here",
    "we will use an alternative representation , using the symmetry for reducing the dimension of the problem . after fixing two radius values @xmath0 and @xmath1 , lensing for an observation event somewhere at @xmath0 and static light sources distributed at @xmath1",
    "is coded in a lens equation , explicitly given in terms of integrals over the metric coefficients , that relates two angles to each other .",
    "this representation results in a particularly convenient method of visualizing all relevant lensing properties , as will be demonstrated with two examples .",
    "the lens equation discussed in this paper should be compared with the lens equation for spherically symmetric and static spacetimes that was introduced by virbhadra , narasimha and chitre @xcite and then , in a modified form , by virbhadra and ellis @xcite .",
    "the virbhadra - ellis lens equation has found considerable interest .",
    "it was applied to the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite and later also to other spherically symmetric and static spacetimes , e.g. to a boson star by dabrowski and schunck @xcite , to a fermion star by bili , nikoli and viollier @xcite , to spacetimes with naked singularities by virbhadra and ellis @xcite , to the reissner - nordstrm spacetime by eiroa , romero and torres @xcite and to a gibbons - maeda - garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole by bhadra @xcite . in the last two papers , the authors concentrate on light rays that make several turns around the center and they use analytical methods developed by bozza @xcite .",
    "the virbhadra - ellis lens equation takes an intermediary position between the exact lens equation and the quasi - newtonian approximation .",
    "it makes no assumptions as to the smallness of bending angles , but it does make approximative assumptions as to the position of light sources and observer .",
    "for the virbhadra - ellis lens equation to be valid the spacetime must be asymptotically flat for @xmath3 and both observer and light sources must be at positions where @xmath4 is large ; moreover , one has to restrict to light sources close to the radial line opposite to the observer position , i.e. , to the case that there is only a small misalignment .",
    "( the question of how one can free oneself from the latter assumption was addressed by dabrowski and schunck @xcite and by bozza @xcite . )",
    "the lens equation to be discussed in the present paper is not restricted to the asymptotically flat case , and it makes no restriction on the position of light sources or observer .",
    "we consider an arbitrary spherically symmetric and static spacetime . for our purpose",
    "it will be advantageous to write the metric in the form @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the standard coordinates on the sphere , @xmath8 ranges over @xmath9 and @xmath4 ranges over an open interval @xmath10\\ , r_{\\mathrm{min } } \\ , , \\ , r_{\\mathrm{max } } \\ , [ \\;$ ] where @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are strictly positive and ( at least piecewise ) differentiable on the interval @xmath10\\ , r_{\\mathrm{min } } \\ , , \\ , r_{\\mathrm{max } } \\ , [ \\;$ ] . as the lightlike geodesics are not affected by the conformal factor @xmath15 ( apart from their parametrizations )",
    ", the lens equation will depend on the metric coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 only .",
    "we will see below that many qualitative features of the lens equation are determined by the coefficient @xmath17 alone .",
    "for introducing our lens equation we have to fix two radius values @xmath0 and @xmath1 between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the index @xmath20 stands for `` observer '' , the index @xmath13 stands for `` source '' .",
    "we think of an observer at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "it is our goal to determine the appearance , on the observer s sky , of static light sources distributed on the sphere @xmath24 .    by symmetry",
    ", we may restrict to the plane @xmath23 .",
    "we consider past - oriented lightlike geodesics that start at time @xmath25 at the observer and terminate , at some time @xmath26 which depends on the geodesic , somewhere on the sphere @xmath27 .",
    "to each of those light rays we assign the angle @xmath28 , measured at the observer between the ray s tangent and the direction of @xmath29 , and the angle @xmath30 , swept out by the azimuth coordinate along the ray on its way from the observer to the source , see figure [ fig : lensmap ] .",
    "the desired lens equation is an equation of the form @xmath31 which relates image positions on the observer s sky , given by @xmath28 , to source positions in the spacetime , given by @xmath30 modulo @xmath32 .",
    "we restrict @xmath28 to values between @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; then @xmath35 can be viewed as a colatitude coordinate on the observer s celestial sphere . by symmetry",
    ", @xmath36 must be equivalent to @xmath37 .",
    "for a given angle @xmath28 , neither existence nor uniqueness of an angle @xmath30 with @xmath31 is guaranteed .",
    "existence fails if the respective light ray never meets the sphere @xmath27 ; uniqueness fails if it meets this sphere several times . in the latter case",
    "the observer sees two or more images of light sources at @xmath1 at the same point on the sky , one behind the other .",
    "we will refer to images which are covered by other images as to `` hidden images '' .",
    "the lens equation can be solved for @xmath30 , thereby giving a _ lens map _",
    "@xmath38 , only if hidden images do not exist ( or are willfully ignored ) .",
    "to work out the lens equation we have to calculate the lightlike geodesics in the plane @xmath23 of the metric ( [ eq : g ] ) , which is an elementary exercise . as a conformal factor",
    "has no influence on the lightlike geodesics ( apart from their parametrization ) , they are solutions of the euler - lagrange equations of the lagrangian @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 where an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the curve parameter @xmath43 . as an aside",
    "we mention that , by ( [ eq : elr ] ) , a circular light ray exists at radius @xmath44 if and only if @xmath45 . comparing this condition with the equivalent but less convenient eq .",
    "( 33 ) in atkinson s article @xcite shows that it is advantageous to write the metric in the form ( [ eq : g ] ) .",
    "the relevance of circular light rays in view of lensing was discussed by hasse and perlick @xcite , also see claudel , virbhadra and ellis @xcite for related results .    to get the past - oriented light ray that starts at time @xmath25 at the observer in the direction determined by the angle @xmath28 we have to impose the initial conditions @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 for each @xmath28 , the initial value problem ( [ eq : elr ] ) , ( [ eq : elphi ] ) , ( [ eq : elt]),([eq : inr ] ) , ( [ eq : inphi ] ) , ( [ eq : int ] ) has a unique maximal solution @xmath49 where @xmath43 ranges from 0 up to some @xmath50 .",
    "every image on the oberver s sky of a light source at @xmath1 corresponds to a pair @xmath51 such that @xmath52 with some parameter value @xmath53 \\ , 0 , s_{\\mathrm{max } } ( \\theta ) \\ , [ \\:$ ] . in other words , we get the desired lens equation @xmath31 if we eliminate @xmath54 from the two equations ( [ eq : el ] ) .    we get an explicit expression for the lens equation , and for the travel time @xmath54 , by writing the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 in terms of integrals . from the constant of motion @xmath57",
    "we find , with the help of ( [ eq : elphi ] ) , ( [ eq : elt]),([eq : inphi ] ) , ( [ eq : int ] ) , @xmath58 if @xmath59 does not change sign , integration of ( [ eq : rs ] ) yields @xmath60 with @xmath61 known , @xmath62 is determined by integrating ( [ eq : elphi ] ) with ( [ eq : inphi ] ) , @xmath63 ( [ eq : intphis ] ) can be rewritten as an integral over @xmath4 , with @xmath64 substituted from ( [ eq : rs ] ) .",
    "this gives us the lens equation in the form @xmath65 if @xmath59 changes sign , ( [ eq : intrs ] ) has to be replaced by a piecewise integration .",
    "similarly , the substitution from the @xmath43-integration in ( [ eq : intphis ] ) to an @xmath4-integration must be done piecewise . in this case , the lens equation is not of the form ( [ eq : phi ] ) ; in particular , it is not guaranteed that the lens equation can be solved for @xmath30 . in any case , we get exact integral expressions for the lens equation , and for the travel time @xmath54 , from which all relevant lensing features can be determined in a way that is not less explicit than the quasi - newtonian approximation formalism .",
    "this will be demonstrated by two examples in section [ sec : examples ] . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : mono ] we treat a particularly simple example where the metric coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath16 are analytic and the integral ( [ eq : intrs ] ) can be explicitly calculated in terms of elementary functions . in this case",
    "it suffices to calculate ( [ eq : intrs ] ) for arbitrarily small @xmath43 to get the whole function @xmath66 by maximal analytic extension ; i.e. , in this case it is not necessary to determine the points where @xmath59 changes sign and to perform a piecewise integration .",
    "in the first part of this section we want to discuss for which values of @xmath28 the lens equation @xmath67 admits a solution . in other words , we want to determine which part of the observer s sky is covered by the light sources distributed at @xmath24 .",
    "we restrict to the case @xmath68 .",
    "( the results for the case @xmath69 follow immediately from our discussion ; we just have to make a coordinate transformation @xmath70 and , correspondingly , to change @xmath28 into @xmath71 .",
    "the case @xmath72 can be treated by a limit procedure . )    for a light ray with one end - point at @xmath0 and the other at @xmath1 the right - hand side of ( [ eq : rs ] ) must be non - negative for all @xmath4 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . this condition restricts the possible values of @xmath28 by @xmath73 where @xmath74 note that our assumptions guarantee that this infimum is strictly positiv , @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , a light ray with @xmath76 can arrive at @xmath1 only if it passes through a minimal radius value @xmath77 .",
    "as ( [ eq : rs ] ) requires @xmath78 , this can be true only if @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "so in general the light sources at @xmath1 cover on the observer s sky a disk of angular radius @xmath82 around the pole @xmath83 and , if @xmath84 , in addition a ring of angular width @xmath85 around the pole @xmath86 , see figure [ fig : sky ] .",
    "the two domains join if @xmath87 .",
    "we see that the allowed values of @xmath28 are determined by the metric coefficient @xmath14 alone .",
    "we will now demonstrate that @xmath14 alone also determines the occurrence or non - occurrence of hidden images .",
    "hidden images occur if a light ray from @xmath0 intersects the sphere @xmath24 at least two times ; between these two intersections it must pass through a maximal radius @xmath88 which , by ( [ eq : rs ] ) , has to satisfy @xmath89 .",
    "such a radius @xmath90 exists for all @xmath28 with @xmath91 where @xmath92 as @xmath28 is restricted by @xmath73 , hidden images can not occur if @xmath93 .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied in asymptotically flat spacetimes , where @xmath94 for @xmath95 , if we choose @xmath1 sufficiently large .",
    "this is the reason why in the more special situation of the virbhadra - ellis lens equation @xcite hidden images can not occur .    in the rest of this section",
    "we discuss the question of multiple imaging and the occurrence of einstein rings . for a light source at @xmath24 , @xmath96 , @xmath23 with @xmath97 ,",
    "images on the observer s sky are in one - to - one correspondence with solutions @xmath28 of the equation @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "we call the integer @xmath100 the `` winding number '' of the corresponding light ray .",
    "an image with @xmath101 is called `` primary '' and an image with @xmath102 is called `` secondary ''",
    ". images with other values of @xmath100 correspond to light rays that make at least one full turn and have been termed `` relativistic '' by virbhadra and ellis @xcite .",
    "note that different images of a light source may have the same winding number .",
    "if we send @xmath103 to 0 or to @xmath104 , solutions @xmath28 of equation ( [ eq : mult ] ) with @xmath105 come in pairs @xmath106 . by",
    "spherical symmetry , every such pair gives rise to an einstein ring .",
    "there are as many einstein rings as the equation @xmath107 admits solutions with positive integers @xmath108 .",
    "even integers @xmath108 correspond to einstein rings of the source at @xmath109 , and odd integers @xmath108 correspond to einstein rings of the source at @xmath110 .",
    "to each solution @xmath51 of the lens equation we can assign redshift , travel time , apparent brightness and image distortion .",
    "the general redshift formula for static metrics ( see , e.g. , straumann @xcite , p. 97 ) specified to metrics of the form ( [ eq : g ] ) says that the redshift @xmath111 is given by @xmath112 if the observer s worldline is a @xmath8-line at @xmath21 and the source s worldline is a @xmath8-line at @xmath27 . in our situation @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are fixed , so the redshift is a constant .",
    "recall that @xmath51 is a solution of the lens equation if and only if there is a parameter @xmath54 such that the equations ( [ eq : el ] ) hold .",
    "this assigns a travel time @xmath54 to each solution @xmath51 of the lens equation .",
    "if there are no hidden images , the equation @xmath113 gives @xmath54 as a single - valued function of @xmath28 .",
    "quite generally , determination of the angular diameter distance requires solving the sachs equations for the optical scalars along lightlike geodesics , see e.g. schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite . for the schwarzschild metric",
    ", this has been explicitly worked out by dwivedi and kantowski @xcite .",
    "their method easily carries over to arbitrary spherically symmetric and static spacetimes as was demonstrated by dyer @xcite . in what follows",
    "we give a reformulation of these results in terms of our lens equation .    to that end",
    "we fix a solution @xmath114 of the lens equation and thereby a ( past - oriented ) light ray from the observer at @xmath0 to a light source at @xmath1 . around this ray ,",
    "we consider an infinitesimally thin bundle of neighboring rays , with vertex at the observer .",
    "the angular diameter distance is defined as the square - root of the ratio between the cross - sectional area of this bundle at the light source and the opening solid angle at the observer .",
    "owing to the symmetry of our situation there are two preferred spatial directions perpendicular to the ray : a radial direction ( along a meridian on the observer s sky ) and a tangential direction ( along a circle of equal latitude on the observer s sky ) . therefore , the angular diameter distance naturally comes about as a product of a radial part and a tangential part .    to calculate the radial part",
    ", we consider the infinitesimally neighboring ray which corresponds to an infinitesimally neighboring solution @xmath115 of the lens equation , i.e. @xmath116 and @xmath117 satisfy @xmath118 we define the _ radial angular diameter distance _ as @xmath119 with @xmath120 given by figure [ fig : lensmap ] , i.e. , @xmath121 measures , in the direction perpendicular to the original ray , how far the neighboring ray is away . by ( [ eq : elphi ] ) ,",
    "( [ eq : inphi ] ) and ( [ eq : rs ] ) , @xmath120 must satisfy @xmath122 with @xmath120 given by ( [ eq : psi ] ) and @xmath123 given by ( [ eq : dphidtheta ] ) , @xmath124 is determined by ( [ eq : dr ] ) for every solution @xmath114 of the lens equation .",
    "note that @xmath124 is singular at those solutions of the lens equation where @xmath125 has a zero .",
    "if the lens equation can be solved for @xmath30 , we may view @xmath124 as a ( single - valued ) function of @xmath28 .    to calculate the tangential part we consider an infinitesimally neighboring light ray that results by applying a rotation around the axis @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "such rotations are generated by the killing vector field @xmath126 . at points with @xmath23",
    ", this killing vector field takes the form @xmath127 .",
    "hence , if we rotate by an infinitesimal angle @xmath128 , the neighboring ray intersects the sphere @xmath24 at a distance @xmath129 from the original ray . relating this distance to the angle @xmath130 between the two rays at the observer gives the _ tangential angular diameter distance",
    "_ @xmath131 by this equation , @xmath132 is uniquely determined for each solution @xmath51 of the lens equation .",
    "again , @xmath132 may be viewed as a function of @xmath28 if the lens equation can be solved for @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath124 and @xmath132 together give the ( averaged ) _ angular diameter distance _ or _",
    "area distance _",

    "odd parity_. images with odd parity show the neighborhood of the light source side - inverted in comparison to images with even parity .    a solution @xmath51 of the lens equation is called a _ radial critical point _ if @xmath136 and a _ tangential critical point _ if @xmath137 .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to @xmath138 and @xmath105 , i.e. , to the occurrence of an einstein ring .",
    "note that ( radial and tangential ) critical points come in pairs , @xmath114 and @xmath139 .",
    "every such pair corresponds to a circle of equal latitude on the observer s sky which may be called a ( radial or tangential ) _ critical circle _ , as in the quasi - newtonian approximation formalism , see schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite , p. 233",
    "in the quasi - newtonian formalism one usually introduces the inverse magnification factors @xmath140 and @xmath141 as substitutes for @xmath124 and @xmath142 . in our situation , where there is no flat background metric , not even asymptotically , the magnification factors can not be defined in a reasonable way , but working with @xmath124 and @xmath142 is completely satisfactory .      in arbitrary spacetimes , the angular diameter distance @xmath143 is related to the ( uncorrected ) _ luminosity distance _ @xmath144 by the universal formula @xmath145 , see , e.g. , schneider , ehlers and falco @xcite , eq .",

    "we give a detailed account in terms of our exact lens equation .",
    "note that the virbhadra - ellis lens equation @xcite is not applicable to this case , at least not without modification , because for @xmath164 the spacetime is not asymptotically flat in the usual sense .",

    "the metric @xmath207 where @xmath208 is a positive constant , is an example for a traversable wormhole of the morris - thorne class , see box 2 in morris and thorne @xcite .",
    "it was investigated , already in the 1970s , by ellis @xcite who called it a `` drainhole '' .",
    "lensing in the ellis spacetime was discussed , in a scattering formalism assuming that observer and light source are at infinity , by chetouani and clment @xcite . in the following",
    "we give a detailed account of lensing in this spacetime with the help of our lens equation .    by comparison of ( [ eq : wormg ] ) with ( [ eq : g ] )",
    "we find @xmath209 where the radius coordinate @xmath4 ranges from @xmath210 to @xmath211 .",
    "( we do _ not _ identify the region where @xmath4 is positive with the region where @xmath4 is negative . )",
    "the function @xmath14 has a minimum at @xmath163 , thereby indicating the existence of circular light rays at the neck of the wormhole . in the following",
    "we consider the case that observer and light sources are on different sides of the neck of the wormhole , @xmath212 .",
    "as a first step , we determine for which angles",
    "@xmath28 the lens equation admits a solution , recall figure [ fig : sky ] . in the case at hand , the angles @xmath82 and @xmath213 defined by ( [ eq : ci ] ) and ( [ eq : cii ] ) are given by @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "hence , the lens equation admits a solution for all angles @xmath28 with @xmath216 and @xmath217 light sources distributed at @xmath24 illuminate a disk of angular radius @xmath218 on the observer s sky .",
    "the apparent rim of the disk corresponds to light rays that spiral asymptotically towards @xmath163 . as the constant @xmath219 defined by ( [ eq : c ] ) satisfies @xmath220 , there are no hidden images , i.e. , the lens equation can be solved for @xmath30 .",
    "with @xmath28 restricted by ( [ eq : wormdelta ] ) we read from ( [ eq : rs ] ) that @xmath59 has no zeros along a ray that starts at @xmath221 and passes through @xmath24 .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : intrs ] ) gives us @xmath55 and thereby the travel time in terms of an elliptic integral , @xmath222 similarly , ( [ eq : phi ] ) gives us @xmath30 as a ( single - valued ) function of @xmath28 in terms of an elliptic integral and thereby the lens equation , @xmath223 see figure [ fig : worm1 ] . as @xmath30 increases monotonously from @xmath224 to @xmath173 on the domain @xmath225- \\delta _ i , \\",
    ", \\delta _ i\\ , [ \\,$ ] , there are infinitely many einstein rings whose angular radii converge to @xmath82 .",
    "if we fix a light source at @xmath96 with @xmath97 , figure [ fig : worm1 ] gives us infinitely many images which can be characterized in the following way .",
    "for every @xmath99 there is a unique @xmath226 - \\delta _ i , \\",
    ", \\delta _ i \\ , [ \\:$ ] such that @xmath227 , and @xmath228 for @xmath229 .    as @xmath30 is a ( single - valued ) function of @xmath28",
    ", so are all observables . by evaluating the formulas derived in section [ sec : obs ] for the case at hand",
    "we find @xmath230 @xmath231    @xmath232    @xmath233    which gives @xmath205 and @xmath206 as functions of @xmath28 via ( [ eq : dlum ] ) and ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) . the observables are plotted in figures [ fig : worm2 ] , [ fig : worm3 ] , [ fig : worm4 ] and [ fig : worm5 ]",
    ".    as there are infinitely many einstein rings whose angular radii converge to @xmath82 , the tangential angular diameter distance must have infinitely many zeros that converge to @xmath82 .",
    "this is difficult to show in a picture unless one transforms @xmath28 into a new coordinate @xmath234 that goes to infinity for @xmath235 .",
    "if one chooses a logarithmic transformation formula , as has been done in figure [ fig : worm3 ] , one sees that in terms of the new coordinate @xmath234 the einstein rings become equidistant .",
    "this feature is not particular to the ellis wormhole ; @xmath236 as a function of @xmath28 always diverges logarithmically when a circular light ray at a radius @xmath44 with @xmath237 and @xmath238 is approached",
    ". the proof can be taken from bozza @xcite .",
    "one may also treat the case that observer and light sources are on the same side of the neck of the wormhole . if the observer is closer to the neck than the light sources , @xmath239 or @xmath240 , the results are quite similar to the case above .",
    "the only difference is in the fact that the light sources appear as a disk of radius _ bigger _ than @xmath241 , i.e. , the disk covers more than one hemisphere . if the observer is farther from the neck than the light sources , @xmath242 or @xmath243 , there are hidden images .",
    "i.e. , one does not get a single - valued lens map @xmath244 .",
    "the qualitative features of lensing by an ellis wormhole are very similar to the qualitative features of lensing by a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the radii @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 in the ellis case correspond respectively to the radii @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath247 in the schwarzschild case . as a matter of fact",
    ", we encounter these same features whenever the function @xmath14 has one minimum , @xmath45 and @xmath250 , and no other extrema on the considered interval .",
    "the lens equation and the formulas for redshift , travel time and radial angular diameter distance used in this paper refer to lightlike geodesics of the @xmath251-dimensional metric @xmath252 , independently of whether this metric results from restricting a spherically symmetric and static spacetime to the equatorial plane .",
    "therefore , these results apply equally well to the plane @xmath253 of a cylindrically symmetric and static spacetime and , of course , to genuinely @xmath251-dimensional spacetimes with the assumed symmetries such as the btz black hole .",
    "( for lightlike  and timelike  geodesics in the metric of the btz black hole see cruz , martnez and pea @xcite . )",
    "e.g. , the metric @xmath254 results not only by restricting the spacetime of a barriola - vilenkin monopole to the plane @xmath23 , as discussed in subsection [ subsec : mono ] , but also by restricting the cylindrically symmetric and static metric @xmath255 to the plane @xmath256 .",
    "the latter metric is well - known to describe the spacetime around a static string , see vilenkin @xcite , gott @xcite and hiscock @xcite , and was investigated in detail already by marder @xcite .",
    "hence , if re - interpreted appropriately , the results of subsection [ subsec : mono ] apply to light rays in the plane perpendicular to a static string . for treating _ all",
    "_ light rays in a cylindrically symmetric and static spacetime one may introduce a modified lens equation , replacing the sphere @xmath24 with a cylinder ."
