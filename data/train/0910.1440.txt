    "when a layer of a lighter fluid lies under that of a heavier fluid , the translation symmetry on the interface is spontaneously broken and the interface is modulated due to the _ rayleigh - taylor _ instability ( rti )  @xcite .",
    "waves on the interface then grow into complicated patterns with mushroom shapes  @xcite .",
    "the rti plays crucial roles in a variety of nonequilibrium phenomena , ranging from convection of water in a kettle to supernova explosions  @xcite .    in the present paper , we investigate the rti and ensuing dynamics in a phase - separated two - component bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the interface properties of such becs .",
    "for instance , the kelvin - helmholtz instability  @xcite , which occurs at the interface between two fluids with a relative velocity , has been observed in a @xmath0 superfluid system  @xcite .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability is also predicted in a two - component bec of atomic gases  @xcite . when a magnetic field is applied to a magnetic fluid ( a colloidal suspension of fine magnetic particles ) , the surface is deformed by the rosensweig instability  @xcite and grows into a pattern of crests .",
    "such a surface phenomenon can be theoretically shown to occur also at the interface in a two - component bec with a dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .",
    "analytical expressions of the interface tension in a two - component bec have been derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the present paper reveals that the rti emerges at the interface between two immiscible becs that are pushed toward each other by , e.g. , a magnetic - field gradient .",
    "we first consider an ideal flat interface , and numerically show that the interface becomes deformed by the rti to grow into the well - known mushroom pattern .",
    "the significant difference between this phenomenon and that in classical fluids is that the vortices under the caps of the mushrooms are quantized .",
    "thus , in three dimensions ( 3d ) , quantized vortex rings are generated around the mushrooms .",
    "bogoliubov analysis shows that the excitation spectrum of the interface modes closely resembles that for classical fluids .",
    "we also propose a realistic bec system in a harmonic trap and show that the rti can be observed experimentally .",
