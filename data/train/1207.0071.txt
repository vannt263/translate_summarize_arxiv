    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) anisotropic oscillator with ` centrifugal ' ( or ` rosochatius ' ) terms = ( p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2)+ q_1 ^ 2+(+ ) q_2 ^ 2 + + [ ba ] , with @xmath23 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 being real parameters and @xmath25 @xmath26 , is one of the most elementary ( albeit instructive ) examples of completely integrable hamiltonian systems . since integrability will be our essential guiding principle when constructing the curved generalization of this system ,",
    "let us firstly recall the ( liouville ) integrability properties of @xmath15 in terms of the @xmath23 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 parameters .    obviously , @xmath15 is always integrable for any value of @xmath18 since it is separable in cartesian coordinates : = i_1+i_2,_1= p_1 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 + , _ 2= p_2 ^ 2 + ( + ) q_2 ^ 2 + .",
    "[ bb ] thus each pair @xmath27 and @xmath28 is formed by two functionally independent functions in involution with respect to the canonical poisson bracket . however , there are two particular situations for which ( [ ba ] ) is known to be superintegrable due to the existence of an additional independent integral of the motion :    * when @xmath29 .",
    "this is is just the isotropic oscillator with rosochatius terms ( @xmath24 arbitrary ) , which is frequently called the anisotropic singular oscillator or the smorodinsky ",
    "winternitz ( sw ) system  @xcite . in this case",
    "the additional integral of the motion is quadratic in the momenta and reads : @xmath30 * if the value of @xmath18 is such that the ratio of the associated oscillator frequencies is a rational number ( @xmath24 can be arbitrary )  @xcite . in this situation",
    "the only case in which the system presents an additional integral that is _ quadratic _ in the momenta is the commensurate 1:2 oscillator ( @xmath14 ) plus a _ single _ rosochatius potential ( say @xmath31 ) .",
    "if either both @xmath32 or the anisotropic oscillator has any other pair of commensurate frequencies then the additional integral is of higher order in the momenta  @xcite .",
    "the resulting 1:2 superintegrable hamiltonian @xmath33 and its quadratic integrals of motion turn out to be & & h^= ( p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2)+ q_1 ^ 2 + 4q_2 ^ 2 + , + & & i^_1_1= p_1 ^ 2 + q_1 ^ 2 + , i^_2= p_2 ^ 2 + 4 q_2 ^ 2 , [ bd ] + & & l^= ( q_1p_2-q_2p_1)p_1 + 2 q_1 ^ 2 q_2 - .",
    "again , @xmath34 and it can be straightforwardly checked that the sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 are formed by three functionally independent functions .    the aim of this paper is to present a generalization @xmath3 of the hamiltonian ( [ ba ] ) on the 2d spaces with constant gaussian curvature @xmath4 .",
    "such a new hamiltonian @xmath3 can properly be considered as a ` curved ' generalization of @xmath15 since it presents two outstanding features :    * @xmath3 depends explicitly on the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath23 , @xmath18 and @xmath24 , and is shown to be integrable for any value of them . * the euclidean limit @xmath37 of @xmath3",
    "is well defined and leads to the hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "an essential point of our approach consists in making use of the curvature @xmath38 of the underlying 2d space as an explicit deformation parameter .",
    "therefore , all the results here presented will be simultaneously valid for the 2d sphere @xmath0 @xmath5 , the hyperbolic plane @xmath1 @xmath6 and the euclidean plane @xmath7 @xmath8 , and the ` flat ' limit @xmath39 in the spherical and hyperbolic systems will lead to the corresponding euclidean hamiltonian  .",
    "conversely , the non - trivial dynamical nature of the transition from the ` flat ' systems defined on @xmath7 to the ` curved ' ones associated to @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be clearly appreciated through this procedure , since @xmath3 can be thought of as an integrable deformation of @xmath17 .",
    "the novelty of @xmath3 stems from the fact that , to the best of our knowledge , there are only two specific values of @xmath18 in ( [ ba ] ) for which an integrable curved generalization of the corresponding euclidean oscillator is known in the literature .",
    "moreover , both known curved systems are superintegrable with an additional integral that is quadratic in the momenta , and correspond with the two euclidean cases that have been explicitly described above .",
    "these two known curved hamiltonians are :    * the so - called higgs oscillator  @xcite , which is the curved analogue of the isotropic ( @xmath29 ) euclidean oscillator . in this case a curved superintegrable generalization of both centrifugal terms can be added to the oscillator potential , and the resulting hamiltonian is called the sw system on the 2d sphere and the hyperbolic plane  @xcite . * a curved analogue of the nonisotropic 1:2 system ( the @xmath16 euclidean oscillator ) but with only one centrifugal term ( @xmath31 ) , which was found in  @xcite .",
    "we will call this system @xmath19 . note that if we want a second curved centrifugal term ( @xmath40 ) to be included without loosing superintegrability , the additional curved integral should be of higher order in the momenta .",
    "this generalization is not known .",
    "therefore , a ` generic ' ( _ i.e. _ , with @xmath10 as an explicit parameter ) integrable generalization @xmath3 of ( [ ba ] ) on @xmath0 and @xmath1 was lacking , and we present it in this paper .",
    "furthermore , the integrals of the motion for @xmath3 will be quadratic in the momenta , and since the limit @xmath41 of @xmath3 will lead to the higgs oscillator , we shall call @xmath3 as the ` anisotropic higgs oscillator ' . on the contrary ,",
    "the known superintegrable system @xmath19 is by no means the particular @xmath16 case in the @xmath18-dependent family @xmath3 , and has to be considered as an ` isolated ' system that deserves a separate analysis .    in this context ,",
    "the natural question concerning the superintegrability of @xmath3 arises .",
    "as we have mentioned before , @xmath3 can be considered as an integrable deformation of @xmath17 in terms of the curvature parameter @xmath4 .",
    "however , the euclidean system @xmath17 is not superintegrable for a generic value of @xmath18 , since it is well known that all the bounded trajectories for @xmath17 are periodic ( lissajous curves ) only in the commensurate and @xmath42 cases",
    ". therefore , one should not expect @xmath3 to be superintegrable for an arbitary value of @xmath18 . in this respect , we have performed a numerical analysis of bounded trajectories of the hamiltonian @xmath3 for @xmath29 as well as for different values of @xmath18 leading to commensurate frequencies in the euclidean system . in all the cases we have also considered several different initial conditions , and the result is that @xmath3 seems to be superintegrable _ only in the @xmath42 case _",
    "( which is the isotropic higgs oscillator or , equivalently , the 1:1 oscillator ) since only in this case bounded trajectories for @xmath3 are always found to be periodic .",
    "in particular , we illustrate this analysis by presenting some bounded trajectories for @xmath3 with @xmath14 and by comparing them with the ones of @xmath19 , which are found to be periodic in agreement with the well known superintegrability of the latter ( note that the neat periodicity of these trajectories gives suppport to the stability of the numerical analysis performed in all the remaining cases ) .",
    "all these results suggest that @xmath3 would be the generic @xmath18-dependent integrable ( but not superintegrable ) curved generalization of the anisotropic oscillator , and that each commensurate euclidean oscillator could admit another curved generalization that would be given in each case by a different hamiltonian .",
    "this conjecture would mean , for instance , that the curved analogue of the 1:3 oscillator ( @xmath43 ) would be a new hamiltonian @xmath44 which would be indeed different from the system obtained from @xmath3 by taking @xmath43 ( note that the additional integral for @xmath44 has to be of higher order in the momenta ) . nevertheless , both hamiltonians would ` collapse ' to a common system in the euclidean limit @xmath37 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly recall the basics on beltrami and geodesic polar variables that generalize the cartesian and polar ones , respectively , to @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section 3",
    "we introduce the anisotropic higgs oscillator @xmath3 and we give the explicit form of its integral of the motion for generic values of all the parameters , including @xmath18 .",
    "we also present some numerical analysis of its trajectories for some commensurate values of its euclidean frequencies , showing that superintegrability does not seem to survive under the deformation introduced through the curvature . in section 4",
    "we analyse the superintegrable curved oscillator given by @xmath19 , and the 1:2 lissajous curves on @xmath0 and @xmath1 are found as the trajectories for the system . in section 5",
    "we perform a detailed geometrical analysis of the ` curved ' centrifugal terms  @xcite of all the previous curved oscillators , and their dynamical effects are also numerically explored .",
    "finally , the last section is devoted to some concluding remarks and open problems .",
    "first of all , let us rewrite the euclidean hamiltonians given in the previous section in terms of polar coordinates @xmath45 with conjugate momenta @xmath46 .",
    "this change of coordinates induces the following canonical transformation q_1= r , q_2=r , p_1= p_r- p_,p_2= p_r+ p _ , [ be ] that transforms the expressions ( [ ba])([bd ] ) into & & h=(p_r^2 + ) + r^2 + r^2 ^2 + + , + & & i_1= 12 ( p_r- p_)^2 + r^2 ^2 + , [ bf ] + & & i_2= 12 ( p_r+ p_)^2 + ( + ) r^2 ^2 + ; & & h^=(p_r^2 + ) + r^2 + 3 r^2 ^2 + , + & & i^_1_1 , i^_2= 12 ( p_r+ p_)^2 + 4r^2 ^2 , [ bg ] + & & l^= ( p_r- p _ ) p_+2 r^3 ^2- .",
    "now , in order to generalize the two above _ flat _ systems ( [ bf ] ) and ( [ bg ] ) to the sphere and to the hyperbolic plane we will apply a geometric aproach in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained as homogeneous spaces of certain 3d lie groups . in this way",
    ", the realization of the associated symmetry generators in terms of geodesic polar and beltrami ( projective ) coordinates will enable us to propose the curved counterparts of these two systems .",
    "let @xmath47 be the 3d real lie algebra with generators @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 with commutation relations and casimir operator given by [ j_12,j_01]=j_02,=-j_01,=j_12 , = j_01 ^ 2+j_02 ^ 2+j_12 ^ 2 , [ ca ] where @xmath4 is a real parameter .",

    "furthermore , such a system together with the previously known curved superintegrable 1:2 oscillator @xmath131 have been algebraically and geometrically studied .",
    "numerical solutions for the trajectories corresponding to some particular initial conditions for both hamiltonians have been presented . in this respect , some remarks are in order .    * the flat contraction @xmath197 is always a well defined and smooth limit in all the expressions presented in the paper . in this way the known systems presented in section 1",

    "* alternatively , this approach can be seen as a ` curvature - deformation ' process of the euclidean anharmonic oscillator that by starting from ( [ bf ] ) and ( [ bg ] ) arrives at the hamiltonians ( [ da ] ) and ( [ dd ] ) , respectively . in this sense",

    "this , in turn , means that the hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath131 are two _ completely different _",
    "systems on the sphere and on the hyperbolic plane .",
    "this fact indicates that different integrable curved systems may collapse under contraction into a single flat one and , conversely , that the integrable generalization of a known commensurate euclidean hamiltonian could split into several generalized ` curved ' possibilites .",
    "starting from all these results , several further research directions can be explored .",
    "firstly , the search for superintegrable curved generalizations of other commensurate euclidean oscillators should be faced . in this respect ,",
    "we recall that the superintegrable hamiltonian @xmath130 ( [ bd ] ) is the only system in the series of anisotropic oscillators with commensurate frequencies that is endowed with quadratic integrals of motion ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the ` additional ' integral that ensures the superintegrability of the system is , in fact , a second order function arising from a true sixth order integral .",
    "more explicitly , if we set @xmath203 then it is known  @xcite that @xmath204 are sixth order integrals of motion of @xmath130 , and that the set @xmath205 , @xmath206 ( [ bd ] ) and @xmath67 is formed by three functionally independent functions .",
    "alternatively , the sixth order integral @xmath67 can be written as @xmath207 now , the second order integral @xmath208 ( [ bd ] ) arises through the following relation @xmath209 remarkably enough , for the curved superintegrable hamiltonian @xmath131 ( [ de ] ) ( in beltrami variables ) , the corresponding sixth order integral @xmath210 can also be found , namely , @xmath211 where @xmath101 are the functions ( [ cd ] ) .",
    "moreover , the relationship with the second order integral @xmath212 ( [ de ] ) remains in the same ` flat ' form @xmath213 therefore these latter expressions seem to point out that the construction of the @xmath196 and @xmath188 analogues of some other euclidean commensurate oscillators could be feasible .",
    "secondly , another interesting open problem would be the construction of the constant curvature analogues of some integrable hnon ",
    "heiles systems ( see  @xcite and references therein ) that can be written as particular cases of the multiparametric family @xmath214 in which the only known integrable cases are the sawada ",
    "kotera ( @xmath215 ) , the kdv ( @xmath216 arbitrary ) and the kaup  kupershmidt ( @xmath217 ) systems .",
    "the results here presented would be a very reasonable starting point , that should be completed with appropriate curved analogues of the cubic hnon ",
    "heiles term .",
    "finally , the explicit solution of the schrdinger equation associated to @xmath3 and @xmath131 should be addressed , as well as the analysis of the quantum nonlinear dynamics generated by these new class of integrable nonlinear quantum models by following , e.g. , the approaches presented in  @xcite . work on all these lines is in progress .",
