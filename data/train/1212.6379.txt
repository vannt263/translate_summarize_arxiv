    "determining the nature of the atmospheres and surfaces of exoplanets is of primary importance in probing not only their formation history but also in identifying possible signatures of life .",
    "while it is very challenging , and perhaps only feasible through direct photometric / spectroscopic observations of the planetary light resolved from that of the host star , there are several proposals for eventual astrobiological investigations of potentially habitable , rocky exoplanets ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the available exoplanetary light would be disk - integrated , i.e. , that of a point source without any spatial resolution . deciphering the exoplanetary light properly , therefore , is inevitably a highly difficult task , in particular for those planets with diverse surface types and atmospheres like our own earth .",
    "indeed , habitable planets are likely to exhibit a variety of complex patterns of their surfaces and atmospheres , intrinsically dependent on their climatology and geology . according to the global water cycle , liquid water on the planetary surface",
    "vaporizes , forms clouds , is carried by atmospheric circulation , and precipitates as rainfall / snowfall . depending on the total amount of water and the atmospheric circulation pattern , the surface of the habitable planets",
    "may be partially covered by ocean ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and be observed only through atmospheres with highly inhomogeneous and variable cloud cover patterns .    given these complexities , techniques to properly decipher the disk - integrated light of exoplanets need to be developed . towards that goal ,",
    "the time variation of planetary light due to spin rotation and orbital revolution is a powerful tool , and several authors have computed the expected variation patterns and proposed the reconstruction methods @xcite .",
    "the variation of the continuum level in the visible to near - infrared ( nir ) range mainly reflects the distribution of landmass , ocean , cloud cover , and possibly vegetation .",
    "the peak - to - trough diurnal variability for 0.1@xmath1m - wide photometry of the earth in the visible / nir range is found to be 10 - 30% @xcite .",
    "thermal emission of the earth also shows a few percent of diurnal variation in the mid - infrared @xcite , which primarily originates from the uneven cloud cover and humidity .",
    "in addition to the light - curve in broad - band photometry mentioned above , molecular absorption depths exhibit diurnal variation . since atmospheric absorption depths of molecules are determined by the column density of the corresponding molecules along the optical path , they are sensitive to the presence of highly reflective cloud cover in the atmosphere that effectively blocks the spectral influence of molecules in the lower atmosphere . for idealized uniformly mixed atmospheres ,",
    "the diurnal variation of molecular absorption features should be strongly linked to the spatial distribution of clouds .    in reality",
    ", the distribution of molecules itself is not entirely uniform and may be time - dependent .",
    "moreover , the spatial and time variations are not the same for different molecular species comprising the atmosphere . in particular , the local column density of water vapor is known to vary widely on a timescale of @xmath2 1 hr @xcite , while other molecules , such as n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 , are well - mixed in the troposphere and thus show no significant variations on short timescales .",
    "this paper extends our previous work on photometric light - curves in visible / nir bands @xcite , and examines the diurnal variation of molecular absorption signatures in the disk - integrated reflection spectra of the earth with future application to earth - analogs in mind .",
    "we focus on the absorption bands of h@xmath0o at 1.13@xmath1 m and o@xmath0 at 1.27@xmath1 m , which are among the most prominent absorption bands in nir and are an indicator of habitability and a biosignature molecule , respectively .",
    "we first analyze data from space - based nir spectroscopy of the earth by nasa s epoxi mission .",
    "then we consider a simple model ( referred to as _ opaque cloud model _ ) that reasonably reproduces the observed variation pattern , if the cloud pattern data are provided separately .",
    "our model implies that the different behavior of water vapor and oxygen in their absorption band variations can be ascribed to their intrinsically different spatial distribution patterns , rather than to the common cloud coverage .",
    "we discuss how this difference can be used to probe signatures of surface and atmospheric inhomogeneity of exoplanets with next - generation direct imaging .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ s : data ] introduces the epoxi data used in this paper and analyses the correlation between absorption depths and pixel - to - pixel climatological data obtained with earth observing satellites .",
    "section [ s : model ] describes our model to reproduce the variation pattern of absorption depths and compares the simulation results with observation .",
    "section [ s : dis ] further discusses the different behavior between h@xmath0o variation and o@xmath0 variation .",
    "finally , section [ s : sum ] draws our main conclusions and discusses the implication for future observation of exoplanets .",
    "an analysis of co@xmath0 , a molecule with properties intermediate between those of h@xmath0o and o@xmath0 in some ways , is presented in appendix [ ap : co2 ] .",
    "[ hr ] from the start of the observations on that date ( see figure [ fig : diurnalvar ] ) .",
    "three vertical dashed lines indicate the wavelength ranges that we adopt to compute the equivalent widths ( h@xmath0o : 1.07 - 1.24@xmath1 m , o@xmath0 : 1.24@xmath3m-1.283@xmath1 m , co@xmath0 : 1.59 - 1.62@xmath1 m ) . ]"
