    "perturbation theory has a long and venerable history in the context of fluids and a detailed description of several different techniques is presented in classic textbooks @xcite , and in excellent dedicated reviews @xcite .",
    "although the general idea dates back to a much earlier time , the first well established paradigm of first- and second - order perturbation theory was devised by zwanzig @xcite for simple fluids , later extended to polar fluids @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was carried out by buff and schindler in the context of solution theory @xcite .",
    "in addition to these theories that assume the hard - spheres model as unperturbed system , other theories exist that rely on the van der waals picture as a starting point , the best known of these being the weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) theory @xcite .",
    "while the wca theory has proven extremely powerful in many applications , for potential with hard - cores the original zwanzig theory offers a natural scheme , hinging on an unambiguous potential separation .",
    "this was eventually put on firm ground by barker and henderson ( bh ) @xcite who provided reliable estimates for square - well fluids @xcite , a rather unrealistic potential in the framework of simple liquids , but much more physically sound when applied to the colloid domain .    in the present paper",
    ", we will apply the bh thermodynamic perturbation theory to the kern - frenkel ( kf ) model for patchy colloids @xcite . in this model @xcite ,",
    "attractive circular patches are distributed on the surface of hard - spheres , and different spheres attract each other provided that any two patches on distinct spheres are suitably aligned , and the relative radial distance between the centers of the spheres is within the range of the attractive tail .    while not new @xcite , these systems have witnessed an impressive resurgence of interest in the last few years for a number of reasons .",
    "the first reason is due to the remarkable improvements in the chemical synthesis techniques that allows to decorate the surface of a colloid with great precision and reliability , a feature that was not possible until few years ago . when combined with the additional advantage , as compared with their atomic counterpart , of an almost arbitrarily control of their size and interaction range , this makes patchy colloids very attractive for technological applications , as elementary building blocks for self - assembly materials of the new generation @xcite .",
    "an additional important reason hinges on the fact that patchy colloids may serve as a paradigm for systems with low valence , strong anisotropy , and highly directional interactions between particles , a feature that is common to many different systems , globular proteins being a notable example , where the heterogeneity of the surface groups can not be neglected even at the minimal level .",
    "several examples of applications and improvements of the original bh scheme have been offered over the years .",
    "verlet and weiss discussed a comparison with numerical simulations and experimental results both for simple @xcite and polar @xcite fluids ; gubbins and gray @xcite proposed a perturbation scheme for molecular fluids ; chang and sandler @xcite exploited it to develop an analytical approximation for the square - well fluid valid within a particular interval of well amplitude ; zhang et al , @xcite applied it to a square - well chain fluid , whereas rotemberg _",
    "@xcite used it to study the phase behavior of mixtures of colloidal particles and interacting polymers .",
    "more recently , zhou @xcite derived a simple procedure hinging on the bh scheme to locate the fluid - solid coexistence phase for a hard - core attractive yukawa fluid , and kalyuzhnyi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite tackled the single and multiple patchy colloids , similar to those treated in the present work , using a generalization of wertheim s thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the present work builds upon the methodology outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite to show that bh second - order perturbation theory can be successfully applied to patchy colloids , as represented by the kern - frenkel model @xcite .",
    "besides thermodynamic quantities , such as virial equation of state and chemical potentials , the method allows a rather precise location of the fluid - fluid and the fluid - solid coexistence lines , in principle for arbitrary number and size of the patches . in this respect ,",
    "the method competes in accuracy with integral equation theory on the same system @xcite , without suffering from the unavoidable instabilities present in that case for low surface coverages and temperatures .",
    "this will be demonstrated by an explicit comparison with numerical simulations carried out @xcite on the same system .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "the model is defined and in section [ sec : perturbation ] the used perturbation technique is described .",
    "some technical details of the calculations are included in appendices [ sec : appa ] and [ sec : appb ] .",
    "section [ sec : coexistence ] includes the method to compute the coexistence curves from the analytical results , with details of the numerical procedure included in appendix [ sec : appc ] .",
    "section [ sec : montecarlo ] briefly summarize some details of the monte carlo calculations , and section [ sec : results ] includes descriptions of all results .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the paper and provides some future perspectives .",
    "consider a fluid formed by @xmath0 particles in a volume @xmath1 at temperature @xmath2 , and assume that they can be described by the kern - frenkel model @xcite in its one - patch version ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) , where the orientation of the patch on each surface sphere @xmath3 and @xmath4 is identified by unit vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , whereas the direction connecting centers of spheres @xmath3 and @xmath4 are identified by unit vector @xmath7 .",
    "two spheres of diameter @xmath8 attract via a square - well potential of width @xmath9 and depth @xmath10 if the directions of the patches on each sphere are within a solid angle defined by @xmath11 , and repel each other as hard spheres otherwise .",
    "the pair potential has the form @xmath12 where the first term is the hard - sphere contribution @xmath13 and the second term @xmath14 is the orientation - dependent attractive part which can be factorized into an isotropic square - well tail @xmath15 multiplied by an angular dependent factor @xmath16 the unit vectors @xmath17 , ( @xmath18 ) , are defined by the spherical angles @xmath19 in an arbitrarily oriented coordinate frame and @xmath20 is identified by the spherical angle @xmath21 in the same frame .",
    "reduced units , for temperature @xmath22 , pressure @xmath23 and density @xmath24 , will be used throughout , with @xmath25 being the boltzmann constant . for future reference",
    ", we also introduce the packing fraction @xmath26 .",
    "two particles then attract if they are within the range of the square - well potential and if their attractive surfaces are properly aligned with each other , and repel as hard spheres otherwise .",
    "the relative ratio between attractive and total surfaces is the coverage @xmath27 that is related to the semi - angular width @xmath11 of the patch .",
    "this can be obtained as @xmath28 where we have introduced the angular average @xmath29",
    "the kern - frenkel potential defined in eqs .",
    "( [ kf : eq1 ] ) , ( [ kf : eq1b ] ) , ( [ kf : eq1c ] ) , ( [ kf : eq2 ] ) , and ( [ kf : eq3 ] ) , leads to the natural separation into a reference one ( the hard - sphere contribution ) and an interaction term ( the remaining , angular dependent , part ) that is usually requested by the standard perturbation theory prescription @xcite .",
    "the presence of the hard - sphere potential for the reference part further suggests the barker - henderson ( bh ) scheme @xcite as the most suitable one for the present model .",
    "this has also the additional advantage that the free energy @xmath30 for the reference system can then be computed in several ways , as further discussed below .",
    "the original scheme , due to zwanzig @xcite , provided the first and second - order terms within the canonical ensemble , in the form of a high temperature expansion @xmath31 where the first term is proportional to @xmath32 , the second to @xmath33 .",
    "although formally correct , it was noticed by barker and henderson @xcite that the corresponding expressions were not useful for finite systems and a grand canonical ensemble derivation provided a much more convenient framework , where the results for the canonical ensemble could be eventually obtained by a legendre transformation .",
    "to the best of our knowldege , the details of the computation for the second - order term were presented in ref . only for isotropic potentials . as its generalization to angular dependent potentials proves to be instructive ,",
    "we have outlined in appendix [ sec : appa ] .",
    "the first term poses no problem and is computed in eq.([appa : eq17 ] ) . when the perturbation parameter @xmath34 and particularized to the kern - frenkel potential given in eqs .",
    "( [ kf : eq1 ] ) , ( [ kf : eq1b ] ) , ( [ kf : eq1c ] ) , ( [ kf : eq2 ] ) , and ( [ kf : eq3 ] ) it becomes @xmath35 note that this term is negative because so is @xmath36 .",
    "the second term is much more involved , but one can apply the same procedure as the isotropic case @xcite , as detailed in appendix [ sec : appa ] .",
    "the result for the second term is reported in eq.([appa : eq18 ] ) . as in the isotropic case , however , this derivation is of little practical use in view of the presence of the three and four point distribution functions @xcite .",
    "barker and handerson @xcite , devised then a simpler procedure to compute this term , based on a discrete representation of the radial axis distributions .",
    "again , the original procedure for spherically symmetric potentials is extended to angular dependent potentials in appendix [ sec : appb ] .",
    "the result for the second - order term is reported in eq.([appb : eq15 ] ) . in case of the kern - frenkel potential ,",
    "it yields @xmath37 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle_{\\omega_1,\\omega_2}\\,\\mbox{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the reduced pressure of the hs reference system in the carnahan - starling approximation @xcite .",
    "this result is identical to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for a different radial part and it is known as _ macroscopic compressibility approximation _ @xcite . although the results given in eqs.([perturbation : eq5 ] ) ( first order ) and ( [ perturbation : eq9 ] ) ( second order ) are somewhat intuitive , being the natural extensions of the isotropic counterpart , a detail analysis of their derivations is important as it might help to improve a drawback of the method that will be discussed at the end of section [ sec : coexistence ] .",
    "once the reduced free energy per particle @xmath39 is known , all thermodynamic properties can be derived . in particular , the pressures and the chemical potentials can be derived from the standard thermodynamic identities @xcite @xmath40    the gas - liquid ( fluid - fluid ) and fluid - solid coexistence curves are determined by the equality of the temperature , pressure and chemical potential in the two coexisting phases . since the two phases are in contact , the condition on the equality of the temperature is always fulfilled .",
    "thus , at fixed temperature @xmath41 , we are left with the two conditions on the pressure and chemical potential .    for the gas - liquid coexistence ,",
    "the conditions are @xmath42 where subscripts @xmath43 indicate that the quantity is computed in the gas and liquid phase respectively .",
    "the solution of this system of non - linear equation gives @xmath44 for the gas coexistence branch , and @xmath45 for the liquid coexistence branch .",
    "the hard - sphere reference part of the free energy ( in excess with respect to the ideal gas ) is assumed to be described by the carnahan - starling relation @xcite @xmath46_{\\text{liquid } } & = & \\frac{4 \\eta^2 - 3 \\eta^3}{\\eta \\left(1-\\eta\\right)^2}\\,\\mbox{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the hard - sphere radial distribution function @xmath47 part appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ perturbation : eq5 ] ) and ( [ perturbation : eq9 ] ) the verlet - weis @xcite corrected percus - yevick solution @xcite is exploited .",
    "the details of the numerical procedure are reported in appendix [ sec : appc ] .",
    "a similar method can be applied to the fluid - solid transition , resulting into the conditions @xmath48    all calculations assume that the solid phase retains the crystal structure of the reference system , namely the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice .",
    "it is possible , especially at low @xmath2 or low @xmath27 where anisotropy effects are more relevant , that fcc is not the most stable solid for the model ; our coexistence results are still valid , although possibly relating to a metastable solid phase .",

    "standard monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the npt and in the grand - canonical ( gc ) ensembles have been implemented to evaluate the equation of state and the density dependence of the chemical potential for both the janus and the sw model .",
    "translational and rotational moves consist of random translation of @xmath55 and random rotation of @xmath56 rad of a randomly selected particle . in the gc study , insertion and",
    "deletion moves have been attempted , in average , every 500 displacement moves . in npt simulations ,",
    "@xmath57 particles were investigated . in gc simulations box sizes",
    "were selected in such a way that the number of particles in the simulation box was would always larger than 500 .",
    "fluid - fcc coexistence lines were calculated via gibbs - duhem integration  @xcite , starting from initial coexistence values at @xmath58 established via direct coexistence methods  @xcite . since at infinite temperature",
    "the kf model reduces to the hard sphere model , coexistence pressures at @xmath58 , a very high value for the kf model , were searched for in the vicinity of the known hs values .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for the details of the procedures .",
    "we point out that all @xmath59 simulations of the fcc solid were carried out in a cubic box to constrain the system to retain the fcc arrangement also in cases where the preferred structure would be a different one , possibly other lattices or a distorted fcc .",
    "this choice was made to properly compare simulation results with the perturbation theory that assumes the cubic fcc arrangement of the reference sw system .",
    "in order to assess the performance of perturbation theory , we first compare results for pressure and chemical potential as derived from the bh scheme outlined in sect.[sec : perturbation ] , with numerical simulations @xcite . these values",
    "were further compared with those derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from integral equation ( ie ) theory within the reference hypernetted chain ( rhnc ) , following the method devised by lado @xcite . in the square - well case ,",
    "integral equation values were taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : fig2 ] ( pressure ) and [ fig : fig3 ] ( chemical potential ) , for two representative values of the coverages , namely the square - well ( @xmath60 ) ( top panels ) and the janus ( @xmath61 ) ( bottom panels ) . in all cases ,",
    "a value of @xmath62 for the total extension of the well ( in units of the hard - spheres diameter ) , was selected in order to compare with previous results .    in the square - well case ( top panels ) , the first selected temperature @xmath63 corresponds to a temperature above the critical temperature , while the last one @xmath64 is well below ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . in both cases ,",
    "the performance of the bh thermodynamic perturbation theory is remarkably good , in agreement with previous findings on the square - well potential @xcite .",
    "the dip in the curve for @xmath64 indeed corresponds to the van der waals loop typical of the coexistence region . in the case of chemical potential ( fig.[fig : fig3 ] ) , the ideal gas low density solution @xmath65 is also reported for comparison .",
    "interestingly , while both monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and rhnc integral equation theory ( ie ) converge to the correct limit , the bh perturbation theory appears to underestimate the chemical potential in the whole range of densities . on the other hand",
    ", it provides the same quality results for all temperatures , even in those regions where integral equation theory are known to experience difficulties .",
    "slightly less satisfactory results are obtained in the case of a janus fluid , as shown in the bottom panels of both figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] . here",
    "the two limiting temperatures @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both above the critical temperature @xcite , as apparent from the absence of any loop in both the pressure and the chemical potential .",
    "the janus phase diagram , however , is known to be anomalous @xcite , as a result of a competition with a micelle formation process that destabilizes the condensation one @xcite . in this case",
    "the bh thermodynamic perturbation theory ( bh ) does not show a well defined pattern as it overestimates the pressure for both temperatures ( fig.[fig : fig2 ] bottom panel ) , as well as the chemical potential for @xmath67 , but underestimates it for the higher temperature @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] bottom panel ) .",
    "while it is known that the bh compressibility approximation can be expected to display different performance at different densities due the presence of higher - order terms @xcite , the above behavior is more likely to be attributed to the anomalous behavior of the janus phase diagram that perturbation theory can not capture at the present stage . in spite of this ,",
    "the performance of bh thermodynamic perturbation theory remains remarkable , especially in view of the difficulties experienced by integral equation theories at such low temperatures associated with low surface coverages .",
    "a very stringent test on the reliability of bh thermodynamic perturbation theory stems from the calculation of the fluid - fluid ( gas - liquid ) coexistence curves .",
    "this is depicted in figure [ fig : fig4 ] where the coexistence curves are computed by bh thermodynamic perturbation theory ( solid lines ) , and contrasted with results from monte carlo numerical simulations ( points ) , from ref .",
    "the considered coverages range from @xmath68 , corresponding to the sw fluid , to @xmath61 , corresponding to the janus limit , and are identical to those considered in ref.@xcite . as before ,",
    "@xmath69 was assumed in all calculations . in the bh thermodynamic perturbation theory ,",
    "further coverages down to the hard - sphere limit were also computed . in all cases ,",
    "the critical points stemming from the bh calculations are also displayed as solid circles on the binodals .",
    "the performance of the bh method appears to be remarkably good .",
    "both the vapor and the liquid branches of the numerical simulations are closely followed by the bh calculations , with an accuracy almost independent of the considered coverage , with the only exception of the janus case ( @xmath61 ) that is however known to have an anomalous behavior @xcite , as remarked .",
    "this is only apparently in contrast with results from chemical potential , reported in previous section [ sec : eos ] , where the bh results for chemical potential in the janus case appeared to be less precise than in the sw case . on the one hand",
    ", a closer inspection reveals that bh results for each single coverage do indeed show a small quantitative discrepancy with the corresponding mc simulation , more or less uniform in the entire density - temperature plane . on the other hand",
    ", this latter feature constitutes an advantage in the method as a numerical solution of eq.([coexistence : eq2b ] ) may provide accurate coexistence lines if both the vapor and the liquid chemical potentials have similar inaccuracies .",
    "this results is , nonetheless , comparable in accuracy with those stemming from reference hypernetted chain ( rhnc ) integral equation theory @xcite , with the additional advantage of a less computational and algorithmical complexity and , more importantly , of being able to access the critical region , including the critical point , that is one of the main shortcomings common to all integral equation theories .    it is worth noticing how bh perturbation theory can provide an accurate prediction of the location of the coexistence lines even below the janus limit , that is for @xmath70 , where extensive numerical simulations are so - far suggesting the fluid - fluid transition to be inhibited by a micellization process @xcite .",
    "this could be useful for a future more focussed numerical calculation within a limited region of the phase diagram where bh theory predicts coexistence to occur .",
    "let us now turn to the fluid - solid coexistence , a calculation that has not been carried out so far for this model by any method . as illustrated in sec.[sec : coexistence ] and below , bh perturbation scheme allows this analysis with an effort , both computational and algorithmical , comparable with that of the fluid - fluid case .    in the isotropic sw case with @xmath69 , the reference point for this calculation are those obtained as early as in 1980 by young and adler @xcite .",
    "using molecular dynamics ( md ) , they reported a detailed study of the different crystal structures ( fcc , hcp , and bcc ) with the corresponding helmholtz free energies , thus arguing that fcc and hcp were the most stable structures within the entire temperature - density plane .",
    "additional numerical simulations were later performed by marr and gast @xcite , serrano - illn and navascus @xcite , and kiselev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite essentially confirming this scenario .",
    "a very detailed study of the entire phase diagram of the sw , was carried out by liu _",
    "_ @xcite .    in fig.[fig : fig5 ] , we report results from bh thermodynamic perturbation theory ( solid line ) along with results from young and adler ( circles ) .    while at high temperatures all calculations agree , discrepancies start to appear on cooling away from the hard spheres limit .",
    "in particular , the plateau appearing in the solid branch of md calculations indicates a fcc - fcc ( or fcc - hcp ) transition that is not accounted for in bh calculations , that assumed fcc structures all the way , although in principle it could be done . in the bh calculations , in particular ,",
    "the difficulty arises from the stability of the numerical scheme used for the solution of eqs.([coexistence : eq4a ] ) and ( [ coexistence : eq4b ] ) .    for lower coverages , no previous calculations on the kern - frenkel model exist to compare with .",
    "fig.[fig : fig6 ] illustrate the coverage dependence of the fluid - solid coexistence lines as computed from mc simulations ( points ) and from bh thermodynamic perturbation theory ( lines ) . as in the fluid - fluid case ,",
    "mc simulations have been obtained up to the janus fluid ( @xmath61 ) , whereas bh theory provides results even below that limit .",
    "simulations below the janus limit could be done , but are computationally more demanding .    as in the sw case ,",
    "even for lower coverages one might expect a structural transition at a certain density . even assuming fcc to be the most stable structure , the range of the potential associated with the value @xmath69 used here , allows a fcc - fcc transition between one fcc with only nearest - neighbors bonded , and a more denser one with even the next - to - nearest - neighbors are bonded .",
    "this is associated with the jump in density that is present in some of the plots of fig.[fig : fig6 ] .",
    "in this paper we presented the first barker - henderson ( bh ) perturbative calculation for the one - patch kern - frenkel model , and compared with specialized mc simulations .",
    "the bh method hinges on a second - order thermodynamic perturbation theory in the inverse temperature , allowing the calculation of the helmholtz free energy within this approximation , and hence , of all thermodynamic quantities , such as the density and temperature dependence of pressure and chemical potential .",
    "a numerical solution has then been implemented to infer the fluid - fluid coexistence line ( binodal ) from the equality of pressure and chemical potential in the vapor and liquid phase at a given temperature .",
    "a similar procedure also provides the fluid - solid transition .",
    "when compared with numerical simulations , the bh predictions are found to be extremely reliable in the entire phase diagram , and for all coverages from the isotropic sw potential to the lowest considered coverage ( @xmath71 ) very close to the hard - spheres limit .",
    "this constitutes one of the main advantages with respect to , in principle , superior and more accurate theoretical methodologies hinging on integral equation solutions , that are typically affected by the impossibility of accessing the critical region , and by the numerical instabilities occurring at low temperatures associated with low coverages . even at the quantitative level",
    ", bh results were found to be competitive with integral equation theories , in agreement with previous results on the isotropic sw fluid .",
    "the performance of bh is particularly noteworthy for coverages below the janus limit , that is for @xmath70 , the most challenging region for numerical simulations in view of the tendency for the particles to form single and multi - layer clusters always exposing the hard - sphere surface in the outer region in order to maximize favorable contacts .",
    "this mechanism competes and destabilizes the condensation process and the interpretation of numerical simulation results become more and more obscure in that region . as a result , a clear scenario suggested by numerical simulations in this region is still missing .",
    "a better understanding could in principle be favored by our bh results that provide a well defined and restricted region of the temperature - density plane where indication of possible coexistences could be sought for .    while in the present paper",
    "the bh method has been applied to a single patch kern - frenkel potential , the method could potentially be extended to higher number of patches with no difficulties . as a matter of fact , this has already been done in ref.@xcite for two - patch colloids with yukawa interactions for the attractive part .",
    "an inspection of the relevant equations ( [ perturbation : eq5 ] ) and ( [ perturbation : eq9 ] ) , however , suggest the result to be identical to the one - patch case at the same coverage .",
    "this means that the bh method , in the present form , is not capable of distinguishing between one and two - patches , at the same coverage , a feature that , conversely , is accounted for in both numerical simulations @xcite and integral equation theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , it can not then account for the anomalous behavior present in the janus limit of the single patch @xcite and not present in the corresponding coverage ( @xmath61 ) of the double patches model @xcite .",
    "this is rather surprising in view of the fact that a similar method , based on a low - density virial expansion , applied to a companion problem , was able to distinguish between single and double patches , albeit with a rather poor estimate for the fluid - fluid transition @xcite .",
    "a promising approach in this respect appears to be the perturbative scheme devised for molecular fluids by gubbins , gray and others @xcite , who considered an expansion in powers of the anisotropic part of the potential , in a way akin to that discussed in appendix [ sec : appa ] , often supplemented by a pad approximant to improve the convergence of the expansion , as proposed by stell et al @xcite .",
