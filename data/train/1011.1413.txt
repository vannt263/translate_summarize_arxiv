    "the internal antarctic plateau represents a potential interesting location for astronomical applications . for almost a decade",
    "astronomers have shown more and more interest towards this region of the earth thanks to its peculiar atmospheric conditions .",
    "the extreme cold temperature , the dry atmosphere , the fact that the plateau is at more than 2500 m above the sea level , that the turbulence seems to develop mainly in a thin surface layer of the order of 30 - 40 m on the top of summits and that the seeing above this surface layer assumes values comparable to those obtained at mid - latitude sites get this region of the earth very appealing for astronomers .",
    "south pole has been the first site equipped with an observatory in the internal antarctic plateau in which measurements of the optical turbulence have been done ( marks et al .",
    "1996 , marks et al .",
    "fifteen balloons have been launched in the winter period and it has been observed that the seeing above a surface layer of @xmath0 220 m was very good ( 0.37 arcsec ) .",
    "measurements of the optical turbulence at dome c are more recent .",
    "after the first observations done in 2004 with a mass ( lawrence et al .",
    "2004 ) , a series of studies done with different instrumentation have been published aiming to provide the assessment of the integrated seeing ( aristidi et al .",
    "2005 , aristidi et al . 2009 ) and the vertical distribution of the optical turbulence ( trinquet et al . 2008 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab_sum2 ]",
    "in this study the mesoscale model meso - nh was used to perform forecasts of optical turbulence ( evolutions of 2 profiles ) for 15 winter nights at three different antarctic sites : dome a , dome c and south pole .",
    "the model has been used with the same configuration previously validated at dome c ( lascaux et al .",
    "2010a ) and simulations of the same 15 nights have been performed above the three sites .",
    "the idea behind our approach is that once validated above dome c , the model can be used above two other sites of the internal antarctic plateau to discriminate optical turbulence features typical of other sites .",
    "this should show the potentiality of the numerical tool in the context of the site selection and characterization in astronomy .",
    "south pole has been chosen because in the past some measurements of the optical turbulence have been done and this can represent a useful constraint for the model itself . for dome a there are not at present time measurements of the optical turbulence and this study provides therefore the first estimates ever done of the optical turbulence above this site .",
    "we test this approach above the antarctic plateau because this region is particularly simple from the topographic point of view and certainly simpler than typical mid - latitude astronomical sites .",
    "no major mountain chains are present and the local surface circulations is mainly addressed by the energy budget air / ground transfer , the polar vortex circulation at synoptic scale and the katabatic winds generated by gravity effects on gently slopes due to the cold temperature of the iced surface .",
    "the main results we obtained are summarized in table [ tab_sum2 ] and listed here :    * we provide the first estimate of the optical turbulence extended on the whole 20 km above the internal antarctic plateau . *",
    "the meso - nh model achieves to reconstruct the three most important parameters used to characterize the optical turbulence : the turbulent surface layer thickness , the seeing in the free atmosphere and in the surface layer for the three selected sites : dome c , dome a and south pole showing results in agreement with expectations .",
    "measurements taken at dome c and south pole corresponds to balloons launched during 15 nights , in both cases .",
    "the statistic is not very large but reliable for a first significant result .",
    "the selected nights correspond to the 15 nights for which measurements of the dome c are available . * dome c and dome a present a very thin surface layer size ( @xmath1 = 37.9 @xmath2 8.1 m and @xmath3 = 44.2 @xmath2 6.6 m ) while south pole surface layer is much thicker ( @xmath4 = 165 @xmath2 17.4 m ) .",
    "if we apply the criterium ( a ) described by eq.(1 ) integrating from the ground instead than 8 m from the ground we find similar result within a couple of meters .",
    "all these estimates are well correlated with measurements .",
    "surface layers calculated by the model at dome c and dome a have a comparable thickness considering the actual sample . to better discriminate between the dome a and dome c surface layer thickness a richer statistic is necessary .",
    "an on - going study has started addressing this issue .",
    "* dome a is the site with the strongest total seeing ( 2.37 @xmath2 0.27 arcsec ) with respect to dome c ( @xmath5 = 1.70 @xmath2 0.21 arcsec ) and south pole ( @xmath6 = 1.82 @xmath2 0.23 arcsec ) .",
    "this is explained by the stronger thermal stability near the ground with respect to the other two sites that cause large values of the optical turbulence in the thin surface layer . *",
    "all the three sites show a very weak seeing in the free atmosphere i.e. above the correspondent mean h@xmath7 : @xmath8 = 0.23 @xmath2 0.28 arcsec at dome a , @xmath9 = 0.30 @xmath2 0.17 arcsec at dome c and @xmath10 = 0.36 @xmath2 0.11 arcsec at south pole .",
    "dome a show the weakest seeing in the free atmosphere . *",
    "the temporal variability of the thickness of the surface layer is more important at south pole than above dome a and dome c that show a very stable trends in agreement with observations .",
    "the temporal variability of the seeing in the whole atmosphere does not show important differences above the three sites , while the variability of the seeing in the free atmosphere is almost double at dome a than at dome c and south pole . *",
    "both , the total seeing and the seeing in the free atmosphere calculated by meso - nh , are very well correlated with measurements at dome c and south pole getting the predictions done at dome a highly reliable .",
    "* dealing with the criteria used to define the surface layer thickness , we proved that , at least on the sample of 15 nights investigated , the criterium defined by eq.[eq : bl1 ] ( criterium a ) and the criterium using the vertical profile of the turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) taking h@xmath7 as the height at which the value of the tke is less than 1@xmath11 of the tke at the lowest level near the ground ( criterium b ) provide very similar results . *",
    "the mean h@xmath7 we estimate at dome c ( h@xmath7=44.2 ) is slightly thicker than what found by @xcite ( h@xmath7=27.7 m ) with comparable discrepancy from measurements ( h@xmath7 = 35.3 @xmath2 5.1 m ) .",
    "the h@xmath7 we estimate at south pole ( @xmath4 = 165 @xmath2 17.4 m ) is thicker than what estimated by @xcite ( @xmath4 = 102 ) but better correlated to measurements ( @xmath4 = 220 m ) than what found by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath7 we estimate at dome a ( @xmath1 = 37.9 @xmath2 8.1 m ) is somehow thicker than what estimated by @xcite ( @xmath1 = 18 m ) .",
    "it is however important to note that the standard deviation of h@xmath7 is of the order of h@xmath7 itself or even larger .",
    "the statistic error @xmath12/@xmath13 is of the order of @xmath0 10 m. we think therefore that at present there are no major differences in our results with respect to @xcite with exeption of the fact that we proved that , with our model , the horizontal resolution of 1 km provides better results than a resolution of 100 km that is used by @xcite .",
    "all these results deserve now a confirmation provided by an analysis done with a richer statistical sample .",
    "also it would be interesting to refine this study when ot measurements above dome a will be published .",
    "besides , we can state that all major expectations concerning the typical features of the optical turbulence above south pole , dome c and dome a have been confirmed by this study .",
    "the tendency shown by the model is obviously that in summer time , in proximity of the surface , due to the less stable regime , the turbulence thickness increases but the turbulence strength decreases .",
    "this is however , out the goals of this paper .",
