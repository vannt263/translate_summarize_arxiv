    "despite the spectacular experimental progress in the past two decades in determining the neutrino oscillation parameters , the nature of new physics responsible for non - zero neutrino masses and mixing is still unknown . given this lack of information , it is essential to explore _ all _ possible ways the neutrino mass mechanism can be probed at various frontiers . in the era of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is therefore natural to ask whether any of the existing theories of neutrino mass can be tested at the energy frontier .",
    "a simple paradigm for neutrino masses is the so - called type - i seesaw mechanism@xcite , which postulates the existence of sterile neutrinos ( @xmath0 ) with majorana mass @xmath1 .",
    "together with the dirac mass @xmath2 , they induce a tree - level active neutrino mass matrix after electroweak symmetry breaking : @xmath3 in a bottom - up phenomenological approach@xcite , the mass scale of the sterile neutrinos , synonymous with the seesaw scale , is _ a priori _ unknown , and could be anywhere ranging from sub - ev all the way up to the grand unification theory scale @xmath4 gev",
    ". however , there are arguments based on naturalness of the standard model ( sm ) higgs mass which suggest the seesaw scale to be below @xmath5 gev@xcite . of particular interest to us are tev - scale seesaw models which are kinematically accessible at the current and foreseeable future collider energies@xcite . under favorable circumstances ,",
    "the hadron collider experiments can _ simultaneously _ probe both the key aspects of seesaw , namely , the majorana nature of the neutrinos and the active - sterile neutrino mixing parameters @xmath6 through the  smoking gun \" lepton number violating ( lnv ) signature of same - sign dilepton plus two jets : @xmath7@xcite and other related processes@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the complementary low - energy probes at the intensity frontier@xcite are mostly sensitive to only one aspect , e.g. neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath8 ) for the majorana nature and lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) searches for the active - sterile neutrino mixing .",
    "in the traditional  vanilla \" seesaw mechanism@xcite , the active - sterile neutrino mixing parameter is suppressed by the light neutrino mass @xmath9 : @xmath10 thus for a tev - scale seesaw , the experimental effects of the light - heavy neutrino mixing are naively expected to be too small , unless the heavy neutrinos have additional interactions , e.g. when they are charged under an additional @xmath11 or @xmath12 gauge group",
    ". however , there exists a class of low - scale type - i seesaw scenarios@xcite , where @xmath13 can be sizable due to specific textures of the dirac and majorana mass matrices in eq .  .",
    "another natural realization of a low - scale seesaw scenario with potentially large light - heavy neutrino mixing is the inverse seesaw mechanism@xcite . in this case , the magnitude of the neutrino mass becomes decoupled from the heavy neutrino mass , thus allowing for a large mixing @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the only lnv parameter in the theory , whose smallness is  technically natural , i.e. in the limit of @xmath16 , lepton number symmetry is restored and the light neutrinos are exactly massless to all orders in perturbation theory .    in the absence of any additional gauge interactions beyond the sm , the amplitudes of the lnv processes in most of the low - scale seesaw models are suppressed by the small mass splitting between the relevant heavy neutrinos , if not by their small mixing with the active neutrino sector , as required to satisfy the light neutrino mass and @xmath8 constraints@xcite . for collider studies in such situations , one can either use the opposite - sign dilepton signal , relying on the specific kinematic features to separate the signal from the huge sm background , or use the trilepton channel @xmath17@xcite , which has a relatively smaller cross section , but a smaller sm background as well .",
    "in addition , one could look for indirect signatures , such as anomalous higgs decays induced by the active - sterile neutrino mixing to probe electroweak - scale sterile neutrinos at the lhc@xcite . introducing new gauge groups beyond the sm and making the sterile neutrinos charged under them enriches the collider phenomenology@xcite , but here our discussion will be limited to the sm seesaw .",
    "the current direct search limits using the same - sign dilepton channel at @xmath18 tev lhc@xcite range from @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) for @xmath21 gev . this is shown by the ` lhc8 ' curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : ven ] for the electron sector at 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "these limits could be improved by roughly an order of magnitude and extended for heavy neutrino masses up to a tev or so with the run - ii phase of the lhc , as shown by ` lhc14 ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : ven ] for 300 fb@xmath22 luminosity .",
    "further improvements by another order of magnitude are possible at the proposed 100 tev @xmath23 collider , as shown by the ` vlhc ' curve for 1 ab@xmath22 luminosity .",
    "the corresponding limits for opposite - sign dilepton signal are expected to be weaker due to the larger sm background .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that the @xmath24 vector boson fusion processes@xcite become increasingly important at higher center - of - mass energies and/or higher masses , and must be taken into account , along with the usual drell - yan production mechanism with an @xmath25-channel @xmath26 boson so far considered in the experimental analyses of the lhc data .",
    "note that the lfv processes ( such as @xmath27 ) put stringent constraints on the product @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) , but do not restrict the individual mixing parameters @xmath30 in a model - independent way .",
    "similarly in the electron sector , the @xmath8 constraints are the most stringent for a large range of the heavy neutrino masses , but are subject to a large uncertainty due to the unknown @xmath31 phases in the seesaw matrix , and hence , do not necessarily render the direct searches redundant .",
    "the current exclusion limits from various other experiments are shown by the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : ven]@xcite .",
    "the dominant production channel for heavy neutrinos at @xmath32 colliders is @xmath33 mediated by an @xmath25-channel @xmath34 ( for all flavors ) and a @xmath35-channel @xmath26 ( for electron flavor)@xcite . using the decay channel @xmath36 with @xmath37 , which would lead to a single isolated electron plus",
    "hadronic jets , 95% cl upper limits on @xmath38 for heavy neutrino mass range between 80 and 205 gev was derived by lep@xcite , as shown by the ` lep ' contour in fig .  [",
    "fig : ven ] .",
    "similar limits were derived@xcite using the lep data on @xmath39 .",
    "future lepton colliders can significantly improve the sensitivity in this mass region , as illustrated by the ` ilc ' curve for @xmath40 gev with 500 fb@xmath22 luminosity@xcite .",
    "due to its relatively cleaner environment , as compared to hadron colliders , a linear collider thus provides better sensitivity up to heavy neutrino mass values very close to its kinematic threshold .",
    "also note that these limits are valid , irrespective of the majorana or ( pseudo-)dirac nature of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "in addition , for heavy majorana neutrinos , one can explicitly look for lnv processes , such as @xmath41@xcite .",
    "also , switching the beam configuration from @xmath32 to @xmath42 mode , one can also search for the lnv signal @xmath43 mediated by a @xmath35-channel majorana neutrino@xcite .    before concluding",
    ", we should mention that the direct searches discussed above are mostly effective for heavy neutrino masses above 100 gev or so . for smaller masses ,",
    "there exist a number of interesting proposals both at energy and intensity frontiers , some of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ven ] labeled as ` dune'@xcite , ` ship'@xcite , ` fcc - ee'@xcite , ` lepton jet and mulitlepton ' at the lhc@xcite .",
    "heavy neutrinos are essential constituents of the simplest seesaw scenario , and hence , their direct searches are important to test the neutrino mass mechanism at the energy frontier .",
    "we have briefly reviewed the current status and future prospects of these direct searches for heavy neutrinos at both hadron and lepton colliders .",
    "we find that while up to an order of magnitude improvement over the current limit is possible at the lhc , the lepton colliders provide a much better sensitivity due to their clean , almost background - free environment .",
