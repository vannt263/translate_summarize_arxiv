    "because we are expanding around a minimum , this shift is not needed for the value of the minimum of the function @xmath401 , i.e. , @xmath406 thus we can determine the shear corrections to the leading density term in eq .",
    "( [ eq52 ] ) .    to calculate the density correction in eq .",

    "the evaluation will have to be done numerically .",
    "in this paper we developed an analytic method for calculating the largest lyapunov exponent of a many body system , based on the microscopic equations of motion . to be specific we restricted ourselves to uniform hard disk systems in two dimensions at low densities , but not necessarily in equilibrium .",
    "as a particular case we considered the uniformly sheared hard disk gas .    to obtain the largest lyapunov exponent we derived a generalized boltzmann equation that describes the time evolution of a distribution function of particle positions and velocities , together with deviation vectors in tangent space . at low densities",
    "the position deviations turn out to be unimportant , to leading orders in the density .",
    "the velocity deviation of a particle may be represented conveniently in terms of the logarithms of its norm the so - called clock value @xmath29 ( eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) )  and an additional unit vector , which in the end plays no essential role .    as in the preceding papers @xcite the generalized boltzmann equation",
    "may be reinterpreted as describing the propagation of a pulled front on the real line of possible clock values .",
    "therefore , by standard techniques the linearized version of this equation may be used to obtain the asymptotic speed of propagation of the front , which is directly proportional to the largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "a remarkable property of the generalized boltzmann equation is that its natural density expansion does not proceed in powers of the dimensionless density @xmath28 , but rather in powers of @xmath407 .",
    "to lowest order , this reproduces the results of earlier work@xcite , which therefore finds a firmer basis here .",
    "here we also give values for the next order in @xmath211 contribution to the largest lyapunov exponent , and we give explicit expressions for the first non - vanishing shear rate dependent contribution to this exponent ( quadratic in the shear rate ) in the uniformly sheared system .",
    "in @xcite we made comparisons between our results and the results of numerical simulations of hard disk lyapunov exponents by dellago and posch@xcite . within the numerical accuracy good agreement",
    "was found , but it turned out there are two complicating factors .",
    "the first one is that the density should be very low to be in the regime where a power series in @xmath408 can be expected to converge rapidly .",
    "the second one is that there are large finite size effects for the front speed @xmath32 .",
    "one can not ( yet ) reach the required number of particles in simulations for these effects to become negligible .",
    "the finite size effects can be estimated for asymptotically large @xmath4 using front propagation techniques , and they would scale as @xmath409 .",
    "it is not known at which number of particles this asymptotic result suffices , though .    to conclude we mention some possible extensions of this work and some interesting problems that are still open for research .",
    "first of all the expressions for the shear rate dependent contribution should be worked out numerically .",
    "we plan to do this on short notice .",
    "then one would like to go more general potentials , to general densities and to three - dimensional systems as well as two - dimensional ones .",
    "we expect that , as long as one stays at low densities , the generalization to other simple ( short ranged and spherically symmetic ) potentials should not pose any serious problems ; one just has to use the generalized boltzmann equation that is appropriate for the potential under consideration . similarly we expect the generalization to three dimensions just will cause some additional technical complications , related to the fact that the directions of the velocity deviations after a collision will depend on those before , unlike in two dimensions .",
    "generalizations to higher density will be much harder to accomplish .",
    "already the fact that the natural expansion in density proceeds in powers of @xmath211 rather than @xmath28 indicates that a systematic expansion up to appreciable density will be forbiddingly hard . on the other hand non - systematic approaches , such as a generalized enskog equation for hard disks or spheres , may give good approximations , but this has not been explored yet .    one can also try to extend the methods developed here so as to calculate additional lyapunov exponents . for non - equilibrium systems the most negative lyapunov exponent is of primary interest , because the sum of this and the largest lyapunov exponent is directly related to the shear viscosity through the conjugate pairing rule@xcite . for the sllod equations with a gaussian or `` constant-@xmath111 '' thermostat ,",
    "there are deviations of this rule@xcite , but these are of higher order in the shear rate , so that the connection with the _ linear _ viscosity still stands .",
    "finally , at low densities , the methods developed here may probably be combined with those of refs .",
    "@xcite in order to calculate the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents , or the ks - entropy , for non - equilibrium cases .",
    "however , a theoretical calculation of the full spectrum of lyapunov exponents , which probably requires similar techniques , remains a very challenging open problem .",
