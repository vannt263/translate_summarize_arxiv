    "the precise measurement of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization will play a major role in discriminating between inflationary models .",
    "the cmb polarization patterns can be decomposed into what are called e - modes and b - modes @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the b - mode polarization is generated by tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "inflationary models predict the scalar power spectrum , @xmath3 , and the tensor power spectrum , @xmath4 , which are naturally generated from quantum fluctuations of inflaton field during inflation @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of tensor perturbation is characterized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath5 .",
    "this ratio usually are given by comparing e - mode and b - mode polarization of cmb .",
    "a joint analysis of the bicep2/keck array and planck favors solutions without gravity waves and have reported the upper limit on the tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the tensor modes supply the non - vanishing values for the off - diagonal components of cmb polarization matrix .",
    "the b - mode is generated when the off - diagonal elements of polarization matrix are non - zero .",
    "accordingly , the future detection b - mode polarization signals acts as fingerprint of gravitational waves .",
    "we assert that instead of tensor perturbations there are other mechanism generating the b - mode polarization @xcite . in this work",
    "we also show that the circular polarization also can act as a source for generating b - modes . the circular polarization in polarization matrix",
    "is parameterized by stokes parameter v. usually it is assumed that at the last scattering surface the thomson ( compton ) scattering does not generate the intrinsic circular polarization of cmb and hence one can input @xmath7 in the polarization matrix .",
    "however , in recent years it have been shown that the primordial circular polarization can be generated due to some effects for example photon - neutrino interaction or the presence of background magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "though , there is no plan to detect the v - mode of cmb in future , the mipol experiment has reported an upper bound ranging between @xmath8 and @xmath9 at angular scales between @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the degree of cmb circular polarization @xcite .",
    "+ in this sense , one can consider the non - zero circular polarization parameter , v , in the polarization matrix .",
    "we can study the effects of circular polarization on the b - mode polarization in two aspects .",
    "+ first , suppose that a source beam is vertically polarized , and that a receive antenna is also vertically linearly polarized such that the direction of linear polarization of the source beam and the antenna are matched .",
    "we set output power is set equal to one for simplicity , then the normalized output of our experiment , as a function of the rotation angle of the receive antenna , would look something like the dashed line shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) . in this figure",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the case that the direction of receive antenna is different from linearly polarized source beam by @xmath12 .",
    "suppose now that the source beam was radiating a right or left hand circularly polarized wave .",
    "if the source beam was subjected to the same measurement as above , the normalized output power would resemble that of fig.([fig1 ] ) as solid line .",
    "this means that a receive antenna with a fixed direction records the total power of circular polarization ( independent of direction ) as it is recording some contribution from linear polarization dependent of its direction with respect to our receive antenna . in other words ,",
    "independence of the direction of the receive antenna , the receive antenna can not cancel the measurement of circular polarization in contrast to linear polarization . in bicep2 experiment , there are partial view of one bicep2 dual - polarization pixel is shown in @xcite .",
    "the vertically oriented slots are sensitive to horizontal polarization and form the antenna network for the a detector , while the horizontally oriented slots receive vertical polarization and are fed into the b detector . in this way ,",
    "the a and b detectors have orthogonal polarizations but are spatially co - located and form beams that are coincident on the sky .",
    "this view corresponds to a bore sight angle of @xmath13 . at bore sight angle of @xmath14 ,",
    "the a detectors receive vertical polarization and the b detectors receive horizontal polarization @xcite . as discussed in previous paragraph , the both vertically and horizontally antennas of bicep2 experiment measure not only linear polarization of cmb but also the circular polarization one . as a result , the e- and",
    "b- mode polarization contain the linear and circular polarizations both which can affect on result of the value of r - parameter .",
    "this means at first the contribution of circular polarization on b- mode should be distinguished from its contribution from linear polarization due to tensor mode and then by using the correct value of b- mode due to tensor mode , one can estimate the value of r - parameter .",
    "+ second , the circular polarization is contributed as a source term for the stokes parameter u upon considering non - zero value for v. usually , the right hand side of the boltzmann equations , the collision term , is computed by assuming the conventional thomson scattering .",
    "the other interactions are not contributes because of the smallness of their scattering cross sections in compare with the thomson cross - section .",
    "if we take into account the thomson scattering only , as it is well known and we will see in the following , the b - mode polarization can not be generated in case of scalar perturbations . we will discuss that this property can change by employing the interactions generating the circular polarization . we generally show that the non - zero circular polarization mode generating through new interactions can be a sufficient source to generate b - mode polarization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the derivation of the standard coupled boltzmann equations of the cmb photons for the scalar perturbations . in section iii we consider the new interactions between cmb photons and electrons generating the circular polarization and discuss their effects on the boltzmann equations . in this section",
    "we derive the new form of boltzmann equations and show that a non - zero v parameter can lead to a non - zero b - mode .",
    "the cmb polarization is described in terms of stokes parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "they are related to the matrix polarization @xmath18 as follows ( see e.g. @xcite and references there in ) = _ 0+q_3 + u _",

    "it is convenient to rewrite the polarization matrix in terms of @xmath23 in the following form = _ 0+(q+iu)_++ ( q - iu ) _ -+v _ 2  , accordingly ,",
    "the @xmath24 now transform like spin 2 objects under the rotation .",
    "we define the 4-vector pp^= ( , q+iu , q - iu , v )  , so that the evolution of @xmath25 is characterized using the boltzmann equation p+n^i_ip = c[p]+g[h _ ]  , [ boltz0 ] where @xmath26 is the conformal time , @xmath27 $ ] is denoting the gravitational red - shift due to metric perturbations and @xmath28 $ ] is the collision term calculated as follows .",
    "it is known that the thomson scattering transforms the polarization vector as @xcite (    c + q+iu + q - iu + v +    ) ^ =(    cccc ^2 + 1 & -^2 & -^2 & 0 + -^2 & ( ^2 + 1)^2 & ( ^2 - 1)^2 & 0 + -^2&(^2 - 1)^2 & ( ^2 + 1)^2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & +    ) (    c + q+iu + q - iu + v +    )  , [ scattering matrix0 ] where @xmath29 is the scattering angle .",
    "we now perform a coordinate rotations in order to transform to a frame in which the wave vector @xmath30 oriented along the @xmath31 direction .",
    "such transformations change the scattering matrix into the form s_t(,)=_m=-2 ^ 2 (    cccc y_2^ y_2^m & - _ 2y_2^ y_2^m & - _ -2y_2^ y_2^m & 0 + -y_2^ _ 2y_2^m & 3_2y_2^ _ 2y_2^m & 3 _ -2y_2^ _ 2y_2^m & 0 + -y_2^",

    "it is possible to summarize these effects into the the gravitational interaction vector @xmath27 $ ] which for scalars is given by @xcite g[h_]=(n^in^j_ij+n^i_ih_00,0,0,0 )  , [ gravityvector ] where here dot denotes derivative with respect to time . in newtonian",

    "as we described above the conventional electron - photon interaction or thomson ( compton ) scattering can not generate the u and v polarization parameters . however , it is known that the new interactions may produce the v parameter @xcite .",

    ", we consider the new interactions generating circular polarization in a general manner . at the first order ,",
    "the new interaction can generally change the evolution of stokes parameters q , u and v. in general , one can parameterize the effects of new interactions by extending the scattering matrix in equation in the following form    s= (    cccc ^2 + 1 & -^2 & -^2 & 0 + -^2 & ( ^2 + 1)^2 & ( ^2 - 1)^2 & 0 + -^2&(^2 - 1)^2 & ( ^2 + 1)^2 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & +    ) + (    cccc 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & _ 22 & _ 23 & _ 24 + 0 & _ 32 & _ 33 & _ 34 + 0 & _ 42 & _ 43 & 0 +    )  , [ correction matrix ] where the @xmath46 corrections are appeared due to the new interaction terms which change the collision terms in the following form c[p]=c_t+ c _  , where the @xmath47 is the collision term due to the thomson scattering and the @xmath48 term is corresponding to the possible new interactions . here",
    "@xmath49 denotes the polarization vector of cmb photons and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the four momentum of interacting particles . the first row and the first column of the correction matrix in consists entirely of zeros",
    "this consideration comes from the nature of new interactions and their leading terms . in following , by introducing the quantum boltzmann equation for the time evaluation of cmb matrix density , @xmath18 , we discuss this point . in our case , the time evaluation of @xmath18 due to the new interaction hamiltonian , @xmath52 , can be simply written as @xcite @xmath53+\\int dt [ h_i,[h_i,\\mathbf{p}]],\\label{b1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the leading non - trivial contribution of new interactions comes from the forward scattering amplitude @xmath54 $ ] whereas the second term , @xmath55 $ ] , corresponding to the higher order new interaction terms , gives the scattering cross section which is highly subdominant compared to the thomson scattering .",
    "hence , we neglect this term for the rest .",
    "note that the forward scattering of cmb photons with any particle can not change their direction and consequently can not change the cmb anisotropy @xmath56 . in the other word",
    ", one can set @xmath57 in .",
    "for the sake of clarity , here we mention some examples . in @xcite , the effects of compton forward scattering due to the electrodynamic sector of the standard model is extended by the lorentz non - invariant operators as well as the non - commutativity effects .",
    "as it has been shown in @xcite , the @xmath46 elements contain lorentz non - invariant and non - commutativity parameters and the non - vanishing components are given by @xmath58 . in letter @xcite , by considering forward scattering between the cmb photons and the cosmic neutrinos background , the first order of quantum boltzmann equation for the density matrix of the cmb photon ensemble are solved and it is shown that @xmath59 .",
    "these results and some other hints from recent works such as studding the interactions of cmb photons in intergalactic magnetic field @xcite or using the effective euler - heisenberg lagrangian @xcite led us to consider the above empirical form for the general scattering matrix .    to proceed , let s consider a general new interaction for cmb photon .",
