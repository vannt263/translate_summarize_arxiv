    "intermetallic compounds containing rare - earth or actinide elements are known to exhibit a variety of low - temperature phases , including antiferromagnetism , superconductivity , and kondo - insulator phases .",
    "the kondo lattice model is one of the standard models describing such physics of heavy electron systems .",
    "the low - temperature properties of the kondo lattice model at half - filling , describing a group of compounds called kondo - insulators , are governed by competition between the kondo- and the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions .",
    "while the kondo interaction favors the formation of intra - atomic quantum disordered ( kondo singlet ) phase , the rkky interaction favors an antiferromagnetic long - range order . in one - dimension ,",
    "the kondo singlet phase is stabilized in the presence of kondo interaction of any strength , causing an energy gap in the charge and spin excitations , the spin gap being always smaller than the charge gap.@xcite    the kondo necklace model is a simplified version of the kondo lattice model in which the charge degree of freedom is frozen out in order to describe the above - mentioned competition.@xcite in fact , the kondo singlet gap @xmath5 always opens in the kondo necklace model as long as any finite kondo interaction is present .",
    "@xcite thus the magnetization of this model starts to grow at a finite critical magnetic field @xmath6 , and continuously increases with increase in the external field .",
    "note that these results for the kondo necklace model are consistent with the magnetization curve of the kondo lattice model .",
    "@xcite    however , the above situation may be drastically changed when the next - nearest - neighboring conduction electron spins coupled antiferromagnetically . in our previous paper,@xcite",
    "we studied a magnetization process of the kondo necklace model with next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath3 which partially frustrates the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 , making use of a finite size scaling analysis of the numerical exact - diagonalization data ,    in ref .",
    "10 we showed that for @xmath7 , the magnetization plateaus appear at zero ( @xmath8 ) and a half saturation magnetization ( @xmath0 ) , satisfying the necessary condition for the appearance of plateaus .",
    "@xcite the origin of these plateaus for @xmath9 can be understood as follows .",
    "the spin configuration in the plateau phase at @xmath8 is interpreted as the aggregate of intra - atomic kondo singlets . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin configuration in the plateau phase at @xmath0 represents the aggregate of intrachain dimers with broken translational symmetry , resulting from the frustrations due to competition between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , the @xmath0 plateau may be completely broken by quantum fluctuations with decreasing @xmath3 in fact , the @xmath0 plateau does not appear at a magnetization curve of the kondo necklace model without next - nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "this suggests that a quantum phase transition between the plateau and nonplateau phases may occur in @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to investigate critical properties of frustrated kondo necklace model @xmath11 removing the restriction @xmath9 imposed in our previous work.@xcite here @xmath12 with @xmath13 denotes the anisotropic spin interaction of the xxz type , @xmath14 with ising anisotropy @xmath1 , @xmath15 are intra - chain spins with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are innercore spins with @xmath18 , hanging from the @xmath19-spin chain .",
    "we choose the nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath2 as the unit of energy , and the kondo exchange coupling @xmath20 is chosen to be antiferromagnetic ( @xmath21 ) . in the case of the ferromagnetic kondo coupling ( @xmath22 ) , this model ( [ eq : knm ] ) has a connection with the haldane problem.@xcite    we are also interested in whether or not the above - mentioned non - plateau phase belongs to the universality class of tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid .",
    "this problem is nontrivial in the case of the kondo necklace model , although it is well known that many one - dimensional quantum spin systems exhibit the tl liquid phase with central charge @xmath23 in the conformal field theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec:2 ] , we map model ( [ eq : knm ] ) onto the quantum sine - gordon model by means of bosonization technique , limiting ourselves to the hilbert space with the half - magnetized states . in  [ sec:3a ] ,",
    "the phase diagram in the plane of ising anisotropy @xmath1 and the frustration parameter @xmath24 will be constructed , making use of the method of level spectroscopy , on the basis of the assumption that our model ( [ eq : knm ] ) is described as the quantum sine - gordon model . in  [ sec:3b ] , the validity of this assumption will be checked by calculating scaling dimensions and the central charge .",
    "it will be shown that the central charge @xmath25 is very close to @xmath26 .",
    "the final section (  [ sec:4 ] ) is devoted to a summary and discussion .",
    "let us consider the effective hamiltonian that describes our model in the @xmath0 plateau phase .",
    "we showed in our previous paper  @xcite that inner core spins of the kondo necklace model with @xmath9 in the @xmath0 plateau phase are almost ferromagnetically aligned along the external field ( @xmath27-axis ) .",
    "this enables us to replace the inner core spin operators @xmath17 with an average @xmath28 , leading to the effective hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the effective magnetic field including the effect of kondo coupling . since the total magnetization of the @xmath19 spins is vanishing ( @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , the system can be effectively regarded as a @xmath16 xxz chain with next - nearest - neighbor interaction in the zero field .",
    "the ground state properties of the model have been extensively studied by many authors by means of various methods .  @xcite it is known that the model is transformed into the quantum sine - gordon model @xmath33 , \\label{eq : sgm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the jordan - wigner transformation and bosonization technique . here",
    ", @xmath34 is the momentum density conjugate to the bosonic field @xmath35 , satisfying the commutation relation @xmath36=i\\delta(x - x')$ ] , and @xmath37 is the lattice constant . the spin wave velocity @xmath38 , the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath39 , and the umklapp scattering amplitude @xmath40 are respectively given as @xmath41 where the coefficients @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are given by @xmath45 thus the critical properties of our system with @xmath0 are well described in terms of the quantum sine - gordon model , although the above expressions for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are valid only when @xmath1 , @xmath24 and @xmath46 are small .",
    "it is well known that the quantum sine - gordon model exhibits two gapful ( corresponding to dimer plateau and nel plateau ) phases and a gapless ( tl liquid ) phases , depending on the value of @xmath39 .",
    "these results are derived from the flow diagram of renormalization group equations derived from the scaling of the cut - off @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "thus the frustrated kondo necklace model belongs to a universality class of tl liquid if the nonlinear term is renormalized to zero as @xmath49 . in",
    "the tl phase the @xmath19-spin excitation is gapless , and the @xmath19-spin correlation functions algebraically decay as @xmath50 on the other hand , the dimer plateau phase is characterized by the @xmath19-spin excitation gap , the exponential decay of the @xmath19-spin correlation , and dimer long - rang order .",
    "the n ' eel plateau phase is characterized by the ising gap for @xmath19-spin and antiferromagnetic long - rang order ( n ' eel order ) .",
    "also , it is known that the dimer - tl and the nel - tl transitions are of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type , and the dimer - nel transition is of the gaussian type .",
    "in this section , we are going to determine the boundaries between tl , dimer , and n ' eel phases on the plane of ising anisotropy @xmath1 and the frustration parameter @xmath24 , making use of the method of level spectroscopy .",
    "this method is known to be powerful in the determination of the bkt transition points , which is difficult by the standard finite size scaling analysis due to logarithmic corrections .",
    "@xcite    since the hamiltonian ( [ eq : knm ] ) is invariant under spin rotation around the @xmath27-axis , translation @xmath51 , and space inversion @xmath52 , the eigenvalues of total magnetization @xmath53 , wave number @xmath54 , and parity @xmath55 are good quantum numbers to label the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath56 .",
    "as expected from bosonization , the ground state with @xmath57 in all three phases ( i.e. , tl , dimer and nel phases ) is shown to be labeled by @xmath58 for the lattice with @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the lattice with @xmath61 on the other hand , the lowest excited state in tl , dimer , and nel phases are labeled by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 for @xmath59 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for the lattice with @xmath61 , respectively .",
