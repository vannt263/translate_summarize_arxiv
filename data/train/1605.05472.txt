    "cosmic rays ( crs ) , discovered more than one century ago , represent the most energetic , and , to some degree , fundamental aspect of the universe .",
    "nuclei constitute dominantly ( @xmath4 ) crs , and electrons contribute the rest @xmath5 .",
    "the energy spectrum of crs observed at earth is well described by a single power - law up to energies of a few pev , above which the spectrum steepens to form the so - called `` knee '' @xcite .",
    "it is general believed that crs below the `` knee '' originate from the galaxy , due to a simple argument that the galactic magnetic field would effectively confine such particles .",
    "however , their acceleration sites and the acceleration mechanism remain open questions .",
    "the deflection of charged crs in the galactic magnetic field makes it very difficult to identify the sources of crs .",
    "high energy @xmath1-rays , produced by either the collision between cr hadrons and the ambient medium or the interaction between cr leptons and the interstellar radiation field and/or the medium , are thus more powerful to probe the sources of crs . with quick development of the detection technology , great progresses have been achieved in high energy @xmath1-ray astronomy during the past two decades .",
    "the satellite - borne instrument fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) , launched in 2008 , discovered over 3000 sources in gev energies @xcite . in tev energies ,",
    "more than 160 @xmath1-ray sources@xmath6 have been firmly detected by the ground - based detectors , including imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) such as h.e.s.s . ,",
    "magic , and veritas , and extensive air shower ( eas ) arrays such as tibet - as@xmath1 , milagro , and argo - ybj .",
    "most of these @xmath1-ray sources are likely to be leptonic , including pulsars , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , binary systems and so on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clear evidence of the sources of hadronic crs is observationally rare .",
    "it is widely believed that supernova remnants ( snrs ) could efficiently accelerate particles at the shock front where the expanding supernova ejecta encounter the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "the well - established diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) theory @xcite predicts a power - law spectrum of the accelerated particles with index of @xmath7 @xcite , well consistent with the radio observations of snrs@xmath8 , as well as the locally observed cr spectrum accounting for the propagation effect .",
    "moreover , the importance of magnetic field amplification by the accelerated particles themselves has been increasingly recognized , which is expected to play a particularly important role in explaining the crs around the knee region ( @xmath9pev ) @xcite .",
    "based on the multi - wavelength observations of snrs , a class of snrs have been suggested to be efficient electron accelerators , e.g. , rx j1713.7 - 3946 @xcite , rx j0852 - 4622 @xcite , rcw 86 @xcite , hess j1731 - 347 @xcite , and sn 1006 @xcite . on the other hand , fermi - lat collaboration reported the detection of the characteristic pion - decay bump in the gev @xmath1-ray spectra of two ancient snrs , ic  443 and w44 , which are interacting with molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "an earlier detection of hard sub - gev spectrum of w44 by agile was also explained to be hadronic origin @xcite .",
    "these observations might give direct evidence for hadronic cr acceleration in snrs @xcite .",
    "however , the role of electron bremsstrahlung in this energy range is still unclear , due to the poorly constrained sub - gev electron spectrum .",
    "the observations of very high energy ( e.g. , @xmath10 tev ) @xmath1-ray emission from snrs will provide a complimentary test of the leptonic / hadronic origin of the @xmath1-rays .",
    "it is expected that electrons will be difficult to be accelerated sufficiently to high energies due to the strong synchrotron and/or inverse compton cooling .",
    "a rough estimate of the synchrotron cooling gives the cooling energy , @xmath11 pev , above which electrons will cool down .",
    "for a typical magnetic field strength of tens of @xmath12 g and an age of @xmath13 yr , @xmath14 tev .",
    "the acceleration of high energy electrons will be even more difficult for old snrs .",
    "furthermore , the inverse compton radiation efficiency of very high energy electrons will be suppressed due to the klein - nishina effect , making the contribution to very high energy @xmath1-rays more difficult .",
    "it is thus expected that @xmath1-ray emission above @xmath15 tev from snrs ( especially the old ones ) , either from shock - crushed dense clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or from the adjacent mcs illuminated by escaping protons @xcite , will strongly support the nuclei acceleration . besides",
    ", the @xmath1-ray observation above 100 tev is also expected to give a constraint on the cutoff energy of shock - accelerated proton , which can help to make a distinction between the theoretical models @xcite .",
    "these become the major motivations that we propose the next generation , km@xmath8 scale cr/@xmath1-ray observatory : the large high altitude air shower observatory ( lhaaso ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the large effective area ( @xmath9km@xmath8 ) and large field - of - view ( @xmath92 sr ) , as well as the high cr rejection power ( @xmath91% ) ,",
    "lhaaso is dedicated to surveying the northern very high energy @xmath1-ray sky with sensitivity of @xmath5 of the crab nebula flux .",
    "lhaaso is expected to not only discover many new sources , but also improve the spectral and morphological measurements of known sources to the highest achievable energies @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the perspective of observing very high energy @xmath1-ray emission from snrs with lhaaso .",
    "we intend to understand the physical potential of lhaaso on the long - standing problem of the origin of hadronic crs .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly introduce the design of lhaaso detectors and their performances on @xmath1-ray detections in sec .",
    "the expected performance of snr observations with lhaaso based on the current gev and/or tev @xmath1-ray observations is presented in sec .",
    "we will pay special attention on the spectral measurements to @xmath16 tev energies .",
    "we conclude our work with some discussions in sec .",
    "lhaaso ( 100.01@xmath17e , 29.35@xmath17n ) is a recently approved , new generation eas experiment which will be built at 4410 m above the sea level near the daocheng village , in sichuan province , china .",
    "lhaaso is a hybrid extensive air shower ( eas ) array covering an area of 1 km@xmath8 ( km2a ) , water cherenkov detector array ( wcda ) , and wide field - of - view imaging cherenkov telescope array ( wfcta ) .",

    ", km2a will reject the hadronic shower background at a level of @xmath22 at 50 tev and even @xmath23 at higher energies , so that @xmath1-rays samples can reach background free above 100 tev .",

    "different from the fermi unidentified sources which are expected to be dominately constituted by active galactic nuclei @xcite , most of the unidentified tev sources are located in the galactic plane ( see fig .",

    "based on the current gev / tev observations of snrs and snr candidates , we estimate their detectability by lhaaso .",
    "the @xmath1-ray spectrum of each source is assumed to be an exponentially cutoff power - law form @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the flux at 1 tev , @xmath32 is the source spectral index , and @xmath33 is the cutoff energy .",
    "we fit the observational data to find the spectral parameters for each source . for the gev only sources and some tev sources , whose cutoff energies can not be well determined , we assume @xmath34 and 100 tev , respectively .",
    "we simulate the observation of each source and calculate its expected significance for 5 years sky survey of lhaaso . for gev - tev and tev snrs , the expected significance above 10 tev under cutoff energy 30 tev and 100 tev are presented in table 1 .",
    "6 snrs can been detected by lhaaso with significance greater than 5 @xmath35 if the cutoff energy is 100 tev .",
    "the significance will decrease if the cutoff energy is lower , while , there still are 5 snrs can been detected by lhaaso if the cutoff energy is 30 tev .",
    "this is the key to confirm whether the snr is hadronic origin or not , shows that the observation level of lhaaso is sensitive to give an judgement on the acceleration mechanism above 30 tev .",
    "morever , it has been found that some snrs could emitted tev @xmath1-rays while in gev energy band there was no observation results , like g106.3 + 2.7 and hess j1912 + 101 .",
    "g106.3 + 2.7 was first observed by drao at radio energy range @xcite . in 2000 , pineault @xmath36 joncas confirmed the object as a snr , with an estimated age of 1.3 myr and distance of 12 kpc @xcite . the pulsar psr j2229 +",

    "<S> supernova remnants ( snrs ) are believed to be the most important acceleration sites for cosmic rays ( crs ) below @xmath0 ev in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> high energy photons , either directly from the shocks of the snrs or indirectly from the interaction between snrs and the nearby clouds , are crucial probes for the cr acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> big progresses on observations of snrs have been achieved by space- and ground - based @xmath1-ray facilities . however , whether @xmath1-rays come from accelerated hadrons or not , as well as their connection with the crs observed at earth , remains in debate . </S>",
    "<S> large high altitude air shower observatory ( lhaaso ) , the next generation experiment , is designed to survey the northern part of the very high energy @xmath1-ray sky from @xmath2 tev to pev with the sensitivity of @xmath3 of the crab nebula flux . in this paper , we indicate that lhaaso will be dedicated to enlarging the @xmath1-ray snr samples and improving the spectral and morphological measurements . these measurements , especially at energies above 30 tev , will be important for us to finally understand the cr acceleration in snrs . </S>"
