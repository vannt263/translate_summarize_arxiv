    "for the next generation of extremely large telescopes ( elts ) , several wide field adaptive optics ( wfao ) concepts like ground - layer ao ( glao ) , multi - conjuguate ao ( mcao ) , laser tomography ao ( ltao ) or multi - object ao ( moao ) have been proposed .",
    "these systems will play a crucial role as most of them could be used as first light instruments .",
    "it is then of prime importance to understand the fundamental limitations , the possible optimizations , and the expected performance of those systems .",
    "the goal of this paper is to bring a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the most general problem of phase reconstruction and correction in multi - guide stars ( gss ) ao .",
    "we try to point out some general trends shared by all these future systems and we propose physical interpretations of the results .",
    "+ all these wfao concepts have in common that they need the knowledge of the 3-dimensional turbulent volume .",
    "the method of measuring the 3-dimensional atmospheric phase perturbations was proposed by tallon and foy@xcite : light from several guide stars ( gss ) is used to probe the instantaneous 3-dimensional phase perturbations , the turbulent volume is then reconstructed by solving an inverse problem .",
    "this technique , called atmospheric tomography , was later improved by johnston and welsh@xcite , ellerbroek@xcite or fusco@xcite for instance .",
    "the tomographic reconstruction error only depends on the gss constellation , atmospheric conditions and wave front sensor ( wfs ) characteristics .",
    "the geometry of the system set the first two fundamental limitations of the tomography : unseen modes and unseen turbulence .",
    "unseen turbulence that originates from partial pupil overlap can play a non negligible role in the global residual variance ( e.g. @xcite ) , however , in the frame of elts this term becomes negligible @xcite .",
    "we then choose to neglect the error due to unseen turbulence in the present study .",
    "instead , in a first part of this paper , we focus on unseen modes and their impact on the phase estimation depending on the reconstructor choice .",
    "+ in addition to this fundamental limitation , in a second part of this paper , we investigate an additional term due to model / statistical errors .",
    "this term comes from a mis - knowledge of system and atmospheric conditions , which limits the tomographic reconstruction .",
    "for instance , conan et al.@xcite and tokovinin et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the sensitivity of the reconstruction error to an error on the cn2 profile ; lelouarn and tallon@xcite have explored the influence of the reconstructed turbulent layers altitudes compared to the real turbulent volume ; fusco et al.@xcite , the effect of a reconstruction on a limited number of equivalent layers ( el ) .",
    "all these studies suggest that the tomography is particularly robust to model / statistical errors .",
    "we generalize these approaches for the elts , and try to give a comprehensive study of the impact of these model errors .",
    "+ once the 3-dimensional turbulent volume is reconstructed , different types of corrections can be applied .",
    "the correction step consists in a projection of the reconstructed tomographic phase on the deformable mirrors ( dms ) .",
    "it only depends on the number and position of the dms with respect to the reconstructed layers , and the optimization area .",
    "if the corrected area is not increased compared to classical ao , only one dm conjugated to the telescope pupil is required to perform the correction ( moao , ltao ) .",
    "the main advantage of those methods is that any target selected in the fov can be corrected : the sky coverage is significantly increased . moreover , there are no additional terms of errors due to projection . for a larger corrected field ,",
    "a trade off between the optimization area and the dms position is applied .",
    "this additional error term was defined by rigaut et al .",
    "@xcite and tokovinin et al .",
    "@xcite as generalized fitting .",
    "for instance , with one dm conjugated to the telescope pupil ( glao ) , a wide field can be corrected uniformly , however the performance is dramatically limited by this error term . to reduce the impact of the generalized fitting",
    ", one must use more dms optically conjugated to the turbulent volume . by correcting the turbulence volume above the telescope ,",
    "the efficiency of the correction is significantly improved ( mcao ) . in the third part of the paper ,",
    "we investigate this particular error term and its impact for elts .",
    "we compare the relative performance expected for the different wfao concepts , we explore the effect of different reconstructors , and we discuss the choice of the number of dms .",
    "+ we choose to conduct all these analyses in the fourier spatial frequency domain because it allows us to perform a fast investigation of the parameter space , and it brings a comprehensive view of the impact of the different terms .",
    "the use of spatial frequency domain techniques was initially proposed by rigaut et al .",
    "@xcite , who derived the analytical expressions for the five most fundamental limits of any natural guide star ( ngs)-based ao system : fitting error , angular anisoplanatism , servo - lag , wfs noise and wfs aliasing .",
    "this single conjugated ngs - ao case was later extended by jolissaint et al .",
    "@xcite , who included the correlation between anisoplanatism and servo - lag error , and generalized the formalism for 2-dimensional systems . in the other hand ,",
    "tokovinin et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed an approach for evaluating , respectively , the wavefront fitting error with a limited number of dms in a mcao system ( the so - called generalized fitting ) , and the tomographic reconstruction error from a limited number of noisy measurements ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "following their approach , gavel @xcite has generalized the optimal tomographic reconstruction for spherical waves .",
    "although this approach requires some simplifications , it allows to treat the so called  focus anisoplanatism \" error .",
    "finally , ellerbroek @xcite has derived an integrated approach that takes into account the fundamental error sources and their correlations for the general case of multi - gss ao and mcao .",
    "+ we follow the ellerbroek s approach , with additional developments to account for model errors and a different formalism . for sake of simplicity , we choose to not include temporal behaviors , aliasing effects or closed loop considerations .",
    "in addition , we will only consider ngs .",
    "this ngs open - loop hypothesis could appear to be restrictive , however , it allows us to obtain simple analytical formulas .",
    "considering the complexity of wfao systems , it is instructive to isolate specific factors in order to disentangle their individual effects .",
    "all these terms can later be included in a second step , or for a real system design for instance .",

    "7 the impact of statistical errors . finally , sect .",
    "8 focuses on the phase control and projection on dms with some examples of different wfao systems and their expected performance for a 42 m telescope .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "the starting point of the fourier method is to assume that the optical system ( phase propagation , wfs measurements , dms commands ) is linear and spatially shift - invariant . in that case , all the usual operators are diagonals with respect to the spatial frequencies and simply act as spatial filters in the fourier domain .",
    "therefore , each equation can be written frequency by frequency .",
    "for instance , the tomographic phase reconstruction is derived and evaluated one fourier component at a time .",
    "in addition , our purpose is to derive regularized reconstructors which make use of the knowledge of the phase and noise statistics .",
    "therefore , these statistics must also be described by linear shift invariant spatial filters .",
    "this is achieved by assuming gaussian and stationary statistics . in that case , the phase and noise statistics can be entirely characterized by their 2nd order moments , more precisely , by their power spectrum density ( psd ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the residual phase in the pupil for one direction of interest is itself fully characterized by its psd .",
    "we will make use of this residual phase psd to carry our analysis .",
    "this is similar to the usual characterization of the turbulent phase by kolmogorov / von karman psd , except that we derive a psd for the residual phase .",
    "similarly to what is usually done for the turbulent phase , we can then construct from this residual phase psd ( i ) the phase structure function , the optical transfer function , the long exposure psf , ( ii ) compute the residual phase variance , ( iii ) generate instantaneous corrected phase screens and instantaneous ao corrected psfs .",
    "the derivation of the residual phase psd for wfao system is described in sect .",
    "[ wfao2 ] .",
    "+ the main advantage of the fourier method is that the computational complexity is significantly reduced compared to spatial domain modeling .",
    "the main limitation is that aperture - edge effects and boundary conditions , which can not be represented by shift - invariant spatial filters , are neglected .",
    "therefore , the fourier modeling only applies to the ideal case of infinite aperture systems . note that this only applies for the calculation of the psd , as for performance evaluation we will be able to account for a finite aperture ( e.g. [ psdtopsf ] ) .",
    "the main assumption is then that all the effects of incomplete beam overlap in the upper atmospheric layers are neglected .",
    "the impact of such an assumption is discussed in @xcite , based on a comparison with a full e2e simulation code .",
    "briefly , they show that as long as the different beams are superimposed in the upper layer , the error due to unseen turbulence has no impact on the tomographic reconstruction . for a 42 m telescope and a typical atmospheric profile",
    ", this would correspond to a maximal gs diameter constellation around 8 arcmin .",
    "+      in the following , we will characterize the performance in term of residual variance and strehl ratio ( sr ) .",

    "we have first presented a matrix formalism for the fourier modeling of any wfao systems .",
    "our fourier tool includes all the specifies of the wfao systems such as tomography , number / positions of dms , model / statistical errors .",
    "the fourier approach is interesting because it allows a fast and easy exploration of the broad parameter space , as well as a detailed comprehension of the underlying physical phenomena . for elts studies ,",
    "it offers a fine and accurate modeling tool , able to provide the end - product psfs .",
    "+ based on this fourier tool , we have explored three main issues of any wfao system , respectively : unseen frequencies , model / statistical errors and projection errors . our goal was not to derive numerical results , but rather to point out general trends shared by the tomographic systems .",
    "we first illustrated how the gs geometry set the amount of unseen frequencies .",
    "the repartition of unseen frequencies is essential to understand the additional errors : they represent the roots where additional errors are growing .",
    "+ our exploration of model / statistical errors draw several limitations shared by all wfao systems .",
    "first , we retrieve that the mmse approach is always more accurate and robust than the best tlse one .",
    "then , that the tomographic reconstruction is robust to statistical errors , but is very sensitive to model errors . for medium fov systems , a good knowledge of any statistical / atmospheric priors is not essential .",
    "however , for large fov systems the sensitivity to turbulent distribution errors becomes significant .",
    "this implies that large fov concepts would require a large number of gs to limit unseen frequencies , or a good monitoring of turbulent conditions .",
    "+ we also derive few rules for a robust control when system and atmospheric conditions are not perfectly known . in such cases , it is advice to ( i ) overestimate noise variance , ( ii ) undererestimate turbulence strength , ( iii ) tends to a constant turbulence profile strength , ( iv ) use more layers in the reconstruction .",
    "finally , we give a first insight into typical performance of the future wfao systems for elts , and we show that regularized tomographic algorithms are essential to provide a significant gain in performance for these future systems .      this work was supported in part by : ( i ) onera ( the french aerospace lab ) ; ( ii ) the french agence nationale de la recherche ( anr ) program 06-blan-0191 ; ( iii ) the european southern observatory , phase a study of a wide field , multi - ifu near ir spectrograph and ao system for the e - elt ; ( iv ) the european community ( framework programme 7 , e - elt preparation , contract no infra-2.2.1.28 .",
