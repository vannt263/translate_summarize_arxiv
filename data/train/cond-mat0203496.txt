    "percolation  @xcite is one of the most fundamental and widely studied systems in statistical physics .",
    "theoretical studies of percolation models and applications of percolation theory to physical systems have spawned thousands of papers over the last few decades .",
    "even so , there are some substantial gaps in our understanding of percolation . for example",
    ", we have at present no exact value for the position @xmath1 of the percolation threshold for site percolation on that simplest of two - dimensional lattices , the square lattice . and",
    "in three dimensions we have almost no exact results whatsoever . because of this",
    ", numerical methods have played an important role in the study of percolation . in this paper",
    "we consider a class of methods for estimating @xmath1 for site percolation using finite - size scaling , and show how various estimates of @xmath1 in this class scale with varying system size in two dimensions .",
    "the methods studied here for measuring @xmath1 are widely used and are all based upon consideration of the crossing probability function @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this function gives the probability that a connected path crosses the system from one boundary segment to another , at site occupation probability  @xmath3 and system size or length - scale  @xmath4 .",
    "some examples of these estimates are :    1 .   the renormalization - group ( rg ) fixed - point estimate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the solution to the equation  @xcite @xmath7 2 .",
    "the average value of  @xmath3 at which crossing first occurs  @xcite : @xmath8 where the last equality follows from integrating by parts .",
    "the prime indicates differentiation with respect to  @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   the estimate @xmath9 corresponding to the point where @xmath2 equals its universal infinite - system value @xmath10 ( which is determined by the system shape and boundary conditions )  @xcite : @xmath11 for a square system , where @xmath12 , this estimate @xmath13 corresponds to the median of the distribution @xmath14 .",
    "a related estimate @xmath15 for rectangular systems is the value of @xmath3 at which the horizontal and vertical crossing probabilities sum to unity  @xcite : @xmath16 this estimate is identical to @xmath17 when the boundary is a perfect square .",
    "4 .   the estimate @xmath18 which is the value of @xmath3 at which @xmath19 reaches a maximum ( or equivalently , where @xmath2 is at its inflection point )  @xcite : @xmath20 5 .   the cell - to - cell rg estimate , which is the point where two systems of different size have the same value of  @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "one possible choice for this estimate , @xmath22 , is the value of @xmath3 at which @xmath23 while a second , @xmath24 , is the point at which @xmath25    in order to use these estimates to determine the threshold precisely , we need to know the manner in which they converge to  @xmath1 as @xmath26 . while it is possible to simulate very large systems for which finite - size effects may be quite small , the statistics for such simulations are still relatively poor because of the small number of samples that can typically be generated . in most cases ,",
    "better results can be derived by doing more simulations on smaller systems , and this requires that the finite - size behavior is characterized accurately .",
    "it is usually assumed ( based upon very general scaling arguments ) that all finite - system estimates of the percolation threshold converge to the bulk value @xmath1 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a system - dependent constant , and @xmath29 is the exponent governing the correlation length  @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 .",
    "( for the two - dimensional systems we will be looking at in this paper  @xmath32 . ) well known exceptions to this behavior are a few highly symmetric , self - dual systems , such as bond percolation on a square lattice with a square boundary , and site percolation on a triangular lattice with a rhomboidal boundary ; in both these cases @xmath2 is perfectly symmetric about @xmath33 for all  @xmath4 and all the estimates above give @xmath34 exactly . for these systems",
    ", one could consider the constant  @xmath28 above to be zero .    in ref .",
    ", however , it was argued that for non - self - dual systems with a square boundary , such as site percolation on a square lattice ( where because of the non - duality the estimates show finite - size effects ) , the convergence of most of those estimates is faster than given by eq .  .",
    "this is an observation of some practical significance , since this particular system ( site percolation on a square lattice with a square external boundary ) is one of the most commonly studied systems in percolation .",
    "similar arguments also apply to other symmetric two - dimensional crossing problems , such as a system with a rhomboidal boundary , which is commonly used when simulating triangular and honeycomb lattices .    the arguments of ref .",
    "were based upon the hypothesis that @xmath35 for large  @xmath4 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 represents the universal part of  @xmath21 , and @xmath38 represents the first - order correction to the scaling limit .",
    "the choice of  @xmath39 as the leading order of the correction was based on numerical measurements of  @xmath21 at  @xmath1 , and can be derived from the assumption that the system is effectively slightly rectangular in shape , because of the different types of boundary conditions applied along the two principal axes  @xcite . for small  @xmath40 , it was assumed that @xmath41 where @xmath42 by the symmetry and self - duality of the square boundary .",
    "the same symmetry also implies that @xmath43 is an odd function in @xmath40 and hence that @xmath44 for all even @xmath45 , as above .",
    "( to see that @xmath43 is odd , note that for the perfectly dual system of bond percolation on a square lattice , @xmath46 is an odd function of @xmath40 for all  @xmath4 , including @xmath47 , and by universality systems with other underlying lattices must behave the same way in the scaling limit . ) in ref .",
    ", no particular assumption was made about the behavior of  @xmath38 , other than its analyticity about  @xmath48 .",
    "note that the form of @xmath37 in eq .",
    "is not entirely universal , because the independent variable @xmath40 should incorporate a metric factor which depends upon the underlying lattice  @xcite .",
    "for convenience , however , since we are considering only the one system of site percolation on a square lattice in this paper , we do not include that factor here .    once the above assumptions , eqs .   and   are made , the convergence of the various estimates of @xmath1 is straightforward to analyze , and one finds that while the rg estimate does indeed converge according to eq .",
    "( a result that has been verified in many numerical studies ) , the rest of the estimates above should converge according to the faster behavior @xmath49 where the constant @xmath28 varies from estimate to estimate .",
    "simulations reported in ref .   for systems of size up to @xmath50 sites verified this convergence for the estimate @xmath51 to high accuracy .",
    "the estimates @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 were studied in ref .   using only exact enumeration results for systems of sizes up to @xmath55 which give polynomials for  @xmath21 ( see the appendix ) , and while the behavior of these results was found to be roughly consistent with  , the uncertainly due to higher - order corrections was large .    following the publication of ref .  , aharony and hovi  @xcite argued that the irrelevant scaling variables in the renormalization - group treatment of percolation imply a slower leading - order convergence of  @xmath56 to its infinite - system value , characterized by an exponent  @xmath57 , whose value was deduced from the monte - carlo work of stauffer  @xcite to be about  @xmath58 .",
    "( note that aharony and hovi used @xmath59 to denote the exponent we call  @xmath57 . )",
    "a variety of series expansion results from the early 1980s were also analyzed to give values for this exponent ranging from  0.89 to over  1  @xcite .",
    "the argument given by aharony and hovi implies that the leading terms in the expansion of @xmath2 should in fact be @xmath60 where @xmath61 hovi and aharony argued that the constant term @xmath62 is zero for a square system , because at @xmath1 there are no correction terms for the square - lattice , bond - percolation system , and corrections due to irrelevant variables should be universal .",
    "they also argued that @xmath38 should be even , so that @xmath63 in  , also by symmetry and self - duality .",
    "they discussed various consequences of these assumptions , and presented numerical evidence that the term containing the exponent @xmath57 is indeed the leading correction term , by showing that the behavior of @xmath2 for large  @xmath40 ( that is , for @xmath64 ) was better fit with such a term than without it .",
    "however , the procedure they used did not allow them to determine the value of  @xmath57 accurately , because of the numerical difficulty of finding @xmath2 precisely for all @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , they did not study the convergence of the other estimates given above .",
    "recently  @xcite , the present authors have shown that quantities like @xmath2 can be studied efficiently for all @xmath3 by first finding the crossing probability @xmath65 in a `` microcanonical '' system of exactly  @xmath66 occupied sites , and then convolving with a binomial distribution to derive results for the corresponding `` canonical '' system thus : @xmath67 where @xmath68 for site percolation on a square lattice .",
    "the microcanonical crossing probability is found using an efficient cluster - joining algorithm employing data structures based on trees and a fast method is employed for checking for percolation on the fly during the progress of the calculation .",
    "( while many of the ideas incorporated in this method were put forward previously  @xcite , this was the first time that all of these components were combined in this way , for the purpose of finding @xmath21 efficiently . ) in ref .",
    "we studied the function corresponding to @xmath21 for the probability of a cluster wrapping around the boundary of a periodic system on a torus . in the present paper , we describe how that method can be implemented for crossing of an open system , and we report results from some large - scale simulations .",
    "the results allow us to determine accurately the behavior of all of the estimates above , and to test the theoretical predictions that follow from eq .  .",
    "as we will see , the appearance of the `` irrelevant '' term in the scaling of some estimates is confirmed , and a new , more precise value of  @xmath57 is found .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we derive the expected scaling behavior of the various estimates of @xmath1 , assuming the form  . in section",
    "[ methods ] we describe our numerical method , and in section  [ results ] we present the results of our simulations . in section  [ concs ]",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "if we assume eq .   to be a correct description of the behavior of @xmath2 , it is straightforward to deduce the resulting convergence of the various estimates for  @xmath1 . in the following paragraphs",
    "we derive the leading correction term for each estimate , or leading two terms when their powers are close to each other .    1 .   the rg fixed - point : the relevant terms of eq .   are @xmath69 which implies @xmath70 l^{-1/\\nu }   + \\o(l^{-2/\\nu}).\\ ] ] the term in brackets is the value of @xmath40 that is the solution to @xmath71 .",

    "( [ pav ] ) gives @xmath72 \\,\\d x,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are the values of @xmath40 at @xmath75 and  1 respectively .",
    "noting that , since @xmath37 is odd about @xmath76 and approaches 1 as @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 and we then get @xmath79 where we have extended the limits of the integrals to @xmath80 . this result",
    "is also implied by eq .",
    "( 40 ) of ref .  , for  @xmath81 .",
    "the order of the next correction depends upon the higher - order corrections to  .",
    "3 .   median-@xmath3 estimate : eq .",
    "gives @xmath82 which implies @xmath83 4 .",
    "maximum estimate : eq .   gives @xmath84 which implies @xmath85 5 .",
    "cell - to - cell estimate : eq .",
    "gives @xmath86 which implies @xmath87 likewise , for @xmath88 we have @xmath89    thus , the scaling of @xmath90 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is unaffected to leading order by the presence of the exponent  @xmath57 .",
    "however , @xmath91 and @xmath53 are affected by @xmath57 to leading order , scaling as @xmath92 , slightly slower than predicted in ref .",
    "( order @xmath93 ) .",
    "note that @xmath94 does not enter in any of these results , so the leading scaling does not change if @xmath94 is equal to zero , as argued to be the case in ref .  .",
    "we have performed simulations to test the scaling hypotheses above using the algorithm described in refs .   and  .",
    "briefly , sites are occupied one by one in random order starting with an empty lattice .",
    "occupied sites form contiguous clusters , each of which is identified uniquely by the site label of a chosen single site within the cluster , which we call the `` root site . ''",
    "other ( non - root ) sites within a cluster possess pointers that point either directly to the root site , or to other sites within the cluster such that by following a succession of pointers one can get from any site to the root .",
    "a newly added site is considered to be a cluster of size one , which is its own root site , and bonds are then added between it and any adjacent occupied sites . the clusters",
    "to which sites at either end of such a bond belong are identified by following pointers from them to their corresponding root sites , and if the root sites found are different we conclude that two different clusters have been joined by the addition of the bond .",
    "we represent this by adding a pointer from the root site of one of the clusters to the root site of the other .",
    "smaller clusters are always made subclusters of larger ones , and all pointers followed are subsequently changed to point directly to the root of their own cluster .",
    "the net result is an algorithm that can calculate @xmath65 ( and many other observable quantities ) for all values of @xmath66 in average running time which is of the order the area of the lattice , or @xmath95 for a square lattice .    in our previous calculations using this algorithm we measured the probability of the existence of a cluster that wraps around the periodic boundary conditions of a toroidal lattice . in this paper",
    "we are interested instead in the existence ( or not ) of a cluster that spans an open system along one given direction",
    ". there are ( at least ) three efficient methods for detecting spanning of this kind , two of which are described in detail in ref .   and all of which we have used in the present work . in the first method , we use the same pointer - based trick that we used in ref .   to detect wrapping with periodic boundary conditions , but start out with an @xmath96 lattice in which one horizontal row of sites is fixed to be permanently empty and",
    "one vertical one is fixed occupied . occurrence of a wrapping cluster in such a system is then exactly equivalent to occurrence of a spanning cluster in the horizontal direction in an open system with dimensions @xmath97 .    in the second method ,",
    "two complete rows of sites at the top and bottom of an open @xmath98 lattice are fixed permanently empty , and two columns of @xmath4 sites on the left and the right sides of the lattice are fixed occupied .",
    "the two columns of occupied sites form two initial clusters on the lattice . by following pointers from one site in each of these clusters",
    "it is then simple to determine whether the two clusters have been amalgamated by other sites added between them : if they have the same root site they have been amalgamated , otherwise they have not . performing this check after the addition of each site to the lattice , we can detect when a spanning cluster on the @xmath97 open lattice first appears .",
    "the two methods have comparable running times and give compatible results .",
    "the second is somewhat simpler to implement .    in the third method , which was used for the majority of the simulations here",
    ", we consider an @xmath99 open lattice and keep track of the minimum and maximum @xmath40- and @xmath100-coordinates for sites in each cluster , updating their values as necessary when clusters are joined .",
    "when @xmath101 for a cluster , we know that the cluster spans the lattice in the horizontal direction , and similarly for vertical crossing .",
    "this method allows one to check for both crossing events simultaneously , and it is also efficient and easy to program . a similar method was used in ref .   for simulations of the ising model .    since in the present calculation",
    "we are only interested in the existence or not of a system - spanning cluster , we can stop the simulation once a spanning cluster is detected , as spanning must also occur for all higher values of  @xmath66 .",
    "this produces about a 40% saving in running time .",
    "each simulation then produces just a single number , the value of  @xmath66 at which a spanning cluster first appears ( or two numbers if we check for spanning in both the horizontal and vertical directions ) . making a histogram of these values over many runs of the algorithm",
    ", we derive an estimate of the probability @xmath102 that the system first percolates when the number of occupied sites reaches  @xmath66 .",
    "this probability is related to the desired function @xmath65 according to @xmath103 , and hence @xmath104 once the @xmath65 is determined , @xmath2 , the corresponding function in the `` canonical '' percolation ensemble , is calculated from eq .  , with the binomial coefficients for large @xmath105 being calculated by iterative multiplication  @xcite .",
    "the estimates @xmath90 , @xmath51 , and @xmath106 for the percolation threshold are then evaluated directly according to eqs .  , , and  .",
    "the remaining estimate , @xmath91 , could be found directly by performing a numerical integral over @xmath2 , but a better method is to use the following exact formula : @xmath107 using eq .",
    "this can also be written directly in terms of @xmath102 as @xmath108 which means that the canonical average position of the percolation threshold is @xmath109 times the microcanonical average @xmath110 and no convolution is necessary to find its value .",
    "higher moments of the distribution @xmath111 can be found in a similar fashion .",
    "for the second moment , for example , we have @xmath112 to find where @xmath113 for the estimate @xmath53 , we make use of the following result : @xmath114.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{r''}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above three results , along with eq .  , demonstrate further the advantage of calculating @xmath2 through the microcanonical  @xmath65 : quantities like @xmath2 and @xmath115 can be calculated exactly at all @xmath3 , while @xmath91 can be found without introducing any error through numerical integration .       an alternative way to represent these results is as a series in @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the transformation can be achieved by substituting @xmath119 , multiplying by @xmath120 , expanding , and replacing @xmath121 again .",
    "the results are given in table  [ rlpqtable ] .",
    "this is also the form that reynolds  @xcite used in their series for @xmath122 through  @xmath123 . from the present point of view , these series are interesting because they are in precisely the form of eq .  , so that the coefficient @xmath124 of @xmath125 above is related to the microcanonical crossing probability @xmath126 simply by @xmath127 that is , @xmath124 represents the number of configurations with @xmath66 occupied sites that satisfy the crossing criterion , out of a total of @xmath128 possible configurations of the @xmath66 occupied sites among the @xmath118 sites of the lattice .",
    "for example , of the @xmath129 possible configurations of 6 occupied sites on a @xmath130 lattice , exactly 390 are percolating by crossing in one direction ( from the third term in @xmath131 ) , yielding a microcanonical probability @xmath132  likewise , for @xmath133 occupied sites on the @xmath130 system , there is exactly one percolating system out of one total system .",
