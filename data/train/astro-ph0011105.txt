    "it has been often considered that emission - line regions around active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are photoionized by the nonthermal continuum radiation from central engines ( e.g. , davidson 1977 ; yee 1980 ; kwan & krolik 1981 ; shuder 1981 ; cohen 1983 ; cruz - gonzlez et al . 1991 ; osterbrock 1993 ; evans et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , this photoionization scenario has sometimes been confronted with several serious problems .",
    "one of such problems is that any single - zone photoionization models underpredict the [ o iii]@xmath04363/[o iii]@xmath05007 intensity ratio , @xmath1 ( e.g. , koski & osterbrock 1976 ; ferland & netzer 1983 ; filippenko & halpern 1984 ; viegas - aldrovandi & gruenwald 1988 ) .",
    "the reason for the underprediction of @xmath1 is thought to be that photoionization of gas in optically thick condition is hard to accomplish electron temperatures above a few @xmath2 k if density of the gas is typical in narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) . in order to solve this problem , many studies have been carried out .",
    "such attempts can be roughly divided into the following two categories .",
    "one is based on the idea that a high density component may contribute to achieve the observed high @xmath1 ( e.g. , baldwin 1975 ; osterbrock , koski , & phillips 1976 ; filippenko & halpern 1984 ; filippenko 1985 ) .",
    "this idea is attributed to the fact that the critical density ( @xmath3 ) of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission ( 3.3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ) is higher than that of the [ o iii]@xmath05007 emission ( 7.0 @xmath6 @xmath5 ) ; which leads to high @xmath1 when the gas density is higher than @xmath7 @xmath5 .",
    "the other idea is to introduce high temperature regions whose temperature is more than a few times 10@xmath8 k. to achieve such high temperatures , either shock - heated regions ( e.g. , koski & osterbrock 1976 ; heckman 1980 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 ) or optically - thin components ( e.g. , wilson , binette , & storchi - bergmann 1997 ) is required .",
    "in addition , some previous studies reported that the values of @xmath1 depend on the agn type ; i.e. , type 1 seyfert nuclei ( s1s ) exhibit higher @xmath1 than type 2 seyfert nuclei ( s2s ) ( e.g. , osterbrock et al .",
    "1976 ; heckman & balick 1979 ; shuder & osterbrock 1981 ; cohen 1983 ) .",
    "this tendency seems to suggest that a part of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission arises from the regions which are obscured only in s2s by any materials , such as dusty tori .",
    "however , this tendency may be interpreted by the intrinsic ( that is , not due to obscuration effects ) difference of nlr properties , such as the size ( schmitt & kinney 1996 ; kraemer et al . 1998 ) or the ionization states ( schmitt 1998 ) .    to investigate the reason why s1s show high @xmath1 than s2s seems useful to explore where and how the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission is radiated",
    ". moreover , these may lead to the new solution to the underprediction problem of @xmath1 . therefore , in this paper , we present how the observed values of @xmath1 are different among various types of seyferts based on a large sample of seyferts compiled from the literature .",
    "then , we compare @xmath1 with various parameters and discuss the nature of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions in agns .",
    "we briefly summarize the policy of classification of seyfert nuclei in this paper , which is the same as that in nagao , taniguchi , & murayama ( 2000c ) .",
    "seyfert nuclei are often divided into three types based on the visibility of broad components of hydrogen recombination lines : i.e. , s1 , seyfert 1.5 ( s1.5 ) , and s2 . the s1s consist of typical s1s ( bls1s ; broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ) and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; e.g. , osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ) .",
    "the type of seyfert 1.2 ( s1.2 ) is included in the type of bls1 in this paper .",
    "we divide the type of s2 into s2@xmath9 and s2@xmath10 ; the former one exhibits the evidence for the existence of broad - line regions ( blrs ) and the latter does not show such the evidence . for the convenience ,",
    "both types of s2@xmath9 and s2@xmath10 are referred as s2@xmath11 when needed ; i.e. , s2@xmath11 = s2@xmath9 + s2@xmath10 .",
    "there are two populations in the types of s2@xmath9 : one shows weak symptoms of the existence of blrs in their optical or near - infrared ( nir ) spectra ( s2@xmath12 ; type 2 seyfert with the reddened blr ) and another one exhibits the hidden blr which is detected only in polarized spectra ( s2@xmath13 ) .",
    "the type of s2@xmath12 consists of seyfert 1.8 galaxies ( s1.8s ) , seyfert 1.9 galaxies ( s1.9s ) , and the seyfert galaxies with the broad paschen or bracket line ( s2@xmath14s ) .",
    "they are combined into s2@xmath9 when statistical treatments are needed .    in order to investigate statistical properties of the observed values of @xmath1 for each type of seyferts",
    ", we compiled @xmath1 from the literature .",
    "the number of compiled objects is 214 ; 26 nls1s , 56 bls1s , 54 s1.5s , 4 s1.8s , 16 s1.9s , 5 s2@xmath14s , 8 s2@xmath13s , and 45 s2@xmath10s .",
    "we basically referred to vron - cetty & vron ( 1998 ) for the agn type of each object . though mrk 335 , mrk 766 , mrk 1126 , h 34.06 , h 1934063 , he 10291831 , and j 13.12 are not classified as nls1 by vron - cetty & vron ( 1998 ) , they are treated as nls1 in this paper because they have been classified as nls1 ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; vaughan et al .",
    "1999 ; rodrguez - ardia , pastoriza , & donzelli 2000 ) .",
    "all the objects are listed in table 1 together with their redshifts , @xmath1 , and the fluxes at 3.5@xmath15 m , 12@xmath15 m , 25@xmath15 m , and 60@xmath15 m .",
    "the values of @xmath1 in this table are the averaged ones among the references given there .",
    "we do not make the reddening correction for the values of @xmath1 since it is often difficult to measure the narrow balmer component , particularly for s1s .",
    "it is noted that we do not use any upper limit data in this study .",

    "there would be possible biases if there are any systematic differences in the redshift distributions or in the intrinsic nuclear luminosity distributions , thus we investigate those distributions below .",
    "first we investigate the redshift distributions .",
    "we show the histograms of redshift in figure 1 .",
    "the mean redshift and the 1@xmath25 deviation for each type are given in table 2 .",
    "there seems to be a tendency that the redshifts of the objects in the samples of the bls1 and the s1.5 are larger than those in the other samples . in order to confirm whether or not this tendency is statistically real ,",
    "we apply the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistical test ( see press et al .",
    "the null hypothesis is that the redshift distributions among the nls1s , the bls1s , the s1.5s , the s2@xmath9s , and the s2@xmath10s come from the same underlying population .",

    "( 3 ) however , the former and the latter are statistically different .",
    "does this difference of the redshift cause any possible biases against the following comparative study ? to investigate this issue , we examine the relation between @xmath1 , which is our main interest in this paper , and redshift ( figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 2 suggests that there is no correlation between @xmath1 and redshift .",
    "this means that the redshift difference among the samples is thought not to cause a bias against the investigation of properties of @xmath1 .",
    "second we consider the intrinsic agn power .",
    "the so - called agn unified model ( antonucci & miller 1985 ; see for a review antonucci 1993 ) requires anisotropic nuclear radiation .",
    "this may cause systematic differences in intrinsic agn power among the types of seyferts depending on selection criteria .",
    "statistical properties of emission - line ratios for each type of seyferts might suffer from this bias of intrinsic luminosity .",
    "therefore , we investigate the intrinsic agn power distributions using the _ iras _ 60@xmath15 m luminosity , which is regarded as rather isotropic emission ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1992 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ; fadda et al . 1998 ) though this might be contaminated with the influence of circumnuclear star formation .",

    "the mean 60@xmath15 m luminosities and 1@xmath25 deviations are given in table 2 .",
    "here we adopt a hubble constant @xmath26 = 50 km s@xmath27 mpc@xmath27 and a deceleration parameter @xmath28 = 0 .",
    "we apply the ks test where the null hypothesis is that the distribution of the 60@xmath15 m luminosity of the samples come from the same underlying population .",
    "the resultant ks probabilities are given in table 3 .",
    "the ks test suggests that there is no systematic difference in the 60@xmath15 m luminosity among the types of seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is noted that there is no correlation between @xmath1 and the 60@xmath15 m luminosity , i.e. , the intrinsic agn power ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we show the histograms of @xmath1 for each type of seyfert galaxies in figure 5 .",
    "the mean and the 1@xmath25 deviation of @xmath1 for each type are given in table 2 . in figure 5",
    ", it is clearly shown that the s2@xmath11s exhibit lower @xmath1 than the nls1s , the bls1s , and the s1.5s .",
    "there seems to be a tendency also in details of the s2@xmath11s ; i.e. , the values of @xmath1 of the s1.8s are higher than those of the s1.9s , and those of the s1.9s are higher than those of the s2@xmath14s , the s2@xmath13s , and the s2@xmath10s although the numbers of the samples are small . these properties can be interpreted that the more the blr emission suffers the reddening , the lower the observed value of @xmath1 is .",
    "we apply the ks test where the null hypothesis is that the distribution of @xmath1 of the various types comes from the same underlying population .",
    "the resultant ks probabilities are given in table 3 .",
    "the ks test leads to the following results .",
    "( 1 ) the nls1s , the bls1s , and the s1.5s are statistically indistinguishable in the frequency distribution of @xmath1 . ( 2 )",
    "the s2@xmath9 and the s2@xmath10 are also statistically indistinguishable .",
    "( 3 ) however , the nls1s , of the bls1s , and of the s1.5s have statistically higher @xmath1 values than the s2@xmath9s and the s2@xmath10s .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous works ; osterbrock et al . ( 1976 ) , heckman & balick ( 1979 ) , and shuder & osterbrock ( 1981 ) have mentioned that the s1s show higher @xmath1 values than the s2s , and cohen ( 1983 ) has found that the s1.5s also show higher @xmath1 values than the s2s .",
    "nagao , murayama , & taniguchi ( 2000a ) recently confirmed that the observed @xmath1 values are statistically indistinguishable between the nls1s and the bls1s ( see also rodrguez - ardia et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it seems possible that the difference in @xmath1 among the types of seyfert galaxies is attributed to the systematic difference in the amounts of the reddening , because we do not make any reddening correction for the compiled emission - line flux data .",
    "thus we investigate the reddening effect on @xmath1 adopting the cardelli s extinction curve ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) .",
    "it results in that the correction factors for the observed value of @xmath1 is 1.222 for the reddening if we assume @xmath29 = 1.0 mag , which is typical difference in the amounts of reddening for nlrs between s1s and s2s ( dahari & de robertis 1988 ; see also de zotti & gaskell 1985 ) .",
    "this factor is too small to explain the systematic difference of @xmath1 among the types of seyfert galaxies .",
    "therefore we conclude that the reason of the systematic difference of @xmath1 among the seyfert types is not the extinction effect but any other mechanism , discussed later .",
    "dust grains within dusty tori in agns absorb nir to soft x - ray photons emitted from the central engine , and re - emit the thermal radiation in the mid - infrared ( mir ) regime . since the tori are quite optically thick , the mir spectrum has strong dependence on the viewing angle ( e.g. , heckman , chanbers , & postman 1992 ; giuricin , mardirossian , & mezzetti 1995 ; heckman 1995 ; fadda et al .",
    "1998 ; murayama , mouri & taniguchi 2000 ) .",
    "this means that the hot inner surface of dusty tori is seen when the torus is observed from a favored ( i.e. , more face - on ) view but obscured when observed from a unfavored ( i.e. , more edge - on ) view . therefore , it is interesting to investigate correlations between the mir colors and @xmath1 .",
    "the dependences of @xmath1 on the flux ratios of _ iras _ 12 @xmath15 m and @xmath30 band to _ iras _",
    "25 @xmath15 m are shown in figure 6 .",
    "these two flux ratios are used to investigate the visibility of the hot inner surface of dusty tori in agns .",
    "the method using the flux ratio of @xmath30 band to _ iras _ 25",
    "@xmath15 m is proposed by murayama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the purpose of reducing the influence of star - formation . in figure 6",
    ", there appears a positive correlation in each diagram . in order to investigate",
    "whether or not these positive correlations are statistically significant , we apply the spearman s rank test ( see press et al .",
    "1988 ) where the null hypothesis is that the observed value of @xmath1 is not correlated with the flux ratios of _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath15 m and of @xmath30 band to _ iras _ 25 @xmath15 m .",
    "the resulting probabilities are 3.598 @xmath23 for the flux ratio of _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath15 m to _ iras _ 25 @xmath15 m and 3.254 @xmath22 for the flux ratio of @xmath30 band to _ iras _ 25 @xmath15 m , which mean that the positive correlations shown in figure 6 are statistically real .",
    "this means that the hotter the observed mir colors are , the higher the observed values of @xmath1 are .",
    "pier & voit ( 1995 ) investigated the hydrodynamic and line - emitting properties of dense clouds exposed to an agn continuum emission at the inner edge of the torus .",
    "since such regions have a large covering factor and a high density ( @xmath31 @xmath5 ) , those clouds are thought to be a plausible place to produce the highly - ionized emission lines such as [ fe vii]@xmath06087 and [ fe x]@xmath06374 @xmath5 for [ fe vii]@xmath06087 and 4.8 @xmath32 @xmath5 for [ fe x]@xmath06374 ( de robertis & osterbrock 1986b ) .",
    "thus these highly ionized emission lines can be radiated in the clouds of @xmath31 @xmath5 . however , low - ionization emission lines such as [ o iii]@xmath05007 are suppressed by a collisional de - excitation in such a dense gas cloud because @xmath3 of low - ionization emission lines are generally low comparing to @xmath33 of the dense gas clouds . ] .",
    "this picture is consistent with the fact that such highly - ionized emission lines are stronger in s1s than in s2s ( murayama & taniguchi 1998a ; nagao et al .",
    "that is , a large part of the high - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( hiners ; binette 1985 ; murayama , taniguchi , & iwasawa 1998 ) is located at the region which is obscured in s2s by any materials , such as dusty tori .    since @xmath1 is higher in s1s than in s2s and @xmath3 of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission is comparable with @xmath3 of [ fe vii]@xmath06087 , it is interesting to investigate the relation between the intensity of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission and those of the hiner emission lines , [ fe vii]@xmath06087 and [ fe x]@xmath06374 .",
    "the flux of these hiner lines is normalized by the flux of [ o iii]@xmath05007 following the manner of murayama & taniguchi ( 1998a ) and nagao et al .",
    "( 2000c ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure 7 .",
    "there is a positive correlation for each case , especially between @xmath1 and the flux ratio of [ fe vii]@xmath06087/[o iii]@xmath05007 .",
    "this means that the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions are located at the same place as the hiners .",
    "it should be noted that the value of @xmath1 correlates to the intensity of [ fe x]@xmath06374 worse than to that of [ fe vii]@xmath06087 .",
    "this is consistent with the remark of nagao et al .",

    "these results are summarized in table 5 .",
    "all these results support the idea that the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region is located at inner region comparing to the [ o iii]@xmath05007 emitting region , and such a strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region is visible only in s1s but obscured in s2s , although a much larger sample will be necessary to confirm these arguments .    to investigate the relationship between the visibility and kinematics of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions more directly , we examine the dependence of @xmath1 on fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363 ) and that on the ratio of fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363)/fwhm([o iii]@xmath05007 ) in figure 9 . in order to examine whether or not there are any correlations in these parameters statistically , we apply the spearman s rank test where the null hypothesis is that the observed value of @xmath1 is not correlated with fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363 ) or fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363)/fwhm([o iii]@xmath05007 ) .",

    "this difference is caused because fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363 ) reflects not only the location of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region but also the mass of a supermassive black hole while the effect of the dispersion of the mass of a supermassive black hole among objects is reduced in the value of fwhm([o iii]@xmath04363)/fwhm([o iii]@xmath05007 ) .",
    "it should be noted that there are some lines of evidence which show that some of broader emission - line widths of highly - ionized emission lines are due to outflows , not to the depth of gravitational potentials ( e.g. , moore & cohen 1996 ; kaiser et al .",
    "2000 ; nelson et al .",
    "2000 ; crenshaw & kraemer 2000 ) .",
    "if this is the case , line widths might not contain the information concerning the geometry of line - emitting gas clouds .",
    "however , unfortunately , the present data can not distinguish these two interpretations .",

    "the first problem is the type dependence of the observed values of @xmath1 , shown in figure 5 .",
    "there are two possible interpretations to understand this dependence .",
    "one is that the [ o iii]@xmath05007 emission is stronger in s2s than s1s due to the intrinsically ( i.e. , not due to inclination effects ) larger size of nlrs of s2s as proposed by schmitt & kinney ( 1996 ) .",
    "another is that the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions exist somewhere but obscured by something on the line of sight when we see s2s . because the intrinsic agn luminosity is similar among the various types of seyferts in our sample as mentioned in section 2.2 , the former case predicts the stronger [ o iii]@xmath05007 luminosity in s2s than in s1s and similar [ o iii]@xmath04363 luminosity among the seyfert types . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter case predicts the similar [ o iii]@xmath05007 luminosity among the seyfert types and the stronger [ o iii]@xmath04363 luminosity in s1s than in s2s .",
    "these two cases may be the extreme ones and the real situation might be intermediate between the two cases . however , it is interesting to investigate which case is close to the observed properties of emission - line spectra .",
    "therefore we compare the observed emission - line luminosity of [ o iii]@xmath05007 and [ o iii]@xmath04363 among various types of seyferts , which is shown in figure 10 . to quantify the statistical significance of the difference in the luminosity distribution among the seyfert types ,",
    "we apply the ks test where the null hypothesis is that the distribution of these emission - line luminosities come from the same underlying population .",
    "the ks test leads to the following results .",
    "( 1 ) the distributions of the [ o iii]@xmath05007 luminosity are statistically indistinguishable among the bls1s , the s1.5s , and the s2s though the [ o iii]@xmath05007 luminosity of the nls1s are weaker than that of other seyfert types .",
    "( 2 ) the distributions of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 luminosity are statistically indistinguishable among the nls1s , bls1s , and the s1.5s though the [ o iii]@xmath04363 luminosity of the s2s are weaker than that of the bls1s and the s1.5s .",
    "the ks probabilities are given in table 6 .",
    "these results are consistent with the latter case ; i.e. , the type dependence of the observed values of @xmath1 is not due to the dilution by a more extended nlr in s2s but due to the enhancement of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission in s1s .",
    "the reason why the [ o iii]@xmath05007 luminosity is smaller in the nls1s than in other types may be that nls1s are the extreme objects on the `` eigenvector 1 '' of boroson & green ( 1992 ) . more explicitly , there is a relation that the weaker the [ o iii]@xmath05007 emission is , the narrower the fwhm of h@xmath36 is ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ; brandt & boller 1998 ; sulentic et al .",
    "2000 ) . following this relation",
    ", nls1s may tend to exhibit weak [ o iii]@xmath05007 emissions as shown in figure 10 .",
    "the properties of emission - line width described in section 3.4 also support the idea that the dependence of @xmath1 on agn types is not due to the dilution of @xmath1 by extended low density gas in s2s but due to the obscuration of the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region in s2s .",
    "the s1s exhibit the broad [ o iii]@xmath04363 comparing to [ o iii]@xmath05007 while the s2s do not so .",
    "this suggests the existence of the inner , strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region which is obscured in s2s .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the dependence of @xmath1 on agn types is attributed to the obscuration effect .",
    "now we consider the following problems .",
    "_ where is the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region in agns ? _ and , _ how is the high @xmath1 comparing to the predicted values by simple photoionization models achieved ? _ according to the current unified model of agns , it is natural to consider that the material obscuring the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting regions in s2s is dusty tori .",
    "if this is the case , the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region may be either the inner surface of dusty tori described by pier & voit ( 1995 ) or the dense gas clouds near the central engine , which are obscured by the tori , though these two alternatives can not be distinguished only by the statistical tests presented in this paper .",
    "this is consistent with the similarity of the location between the hiner and the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region , which is suggested by the correlation between the intensity of the hiner emission and @xmath1 ( see section 3.3 ) because large parts of the hiner emission is thought to arise from such dense clouds ( pier & voit 1995 ; murayama & taniguchi 1998a , 1998b ; nagao et al .",
    "the mir properties described in section 3.2 also support this geometrical consideration of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region ; i.e. , the correlations between the mir colors and @xmath1 mean the similarity between the visibility of relatively hot inner surface of dusty tori and that of the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region .",
    "however , some of s2s also exhibit large @xmath1 , which is also difficult to be explained by the simple one - zone photoionization model .",
    "they may be have dense gas clouds in nlr , which is not obscured by dusty tori because of the large distance from the nucleus , or the escaping [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission from the leaky parts of the tori .      as described in section 4.1 , high - density gas clouds obscured by tori , which are located either at the inner surface of dusty tori or near the central engine where is obscured by the tori , are thought to emit a large fraction of the [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission . in order to investigate whether or not such an idea is consistent with photoionization scenarios quantitatively , we perform dual - component photoionization model calculations following the manner of murayama & taniguchi ( 1998b ) . this method takes account of such high - density gas clouds as a strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitter , in addition to the typical nlr component . here",
    "we assume the second situation , i.e. , the strong [ o iii]@xmath04363 emitting region is not physically associated by the tori .",
    "therefore we do not consider effects of dust , such as depletion of heavy metals , through the following calculations .",
    "our calculation methods are as follows .",
    "we perform photoionization model calculations using the spectral synthesis code _ cloudy _ version 90.04 ( ferland 1996 ) , which solves the equations of statistical and thermal equilibrium and produces a self - consistent model of the run of temperature as a function of depth into the nebula . here",
    "we assume an uniform - density gas cloud with a plane - parallel geometry . the dense component ( dc ) is assumed to be truncated clouds ; i.e. , optically thin clouds for the ionizing photons , for the purpose of avoiding unusually strong [ o i ] emission ( see murayama & taniguchi 1998b ) .",
    "the parameters for the calculations are ( 1 ) the hydrogen density of the cloud ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , ( 2 ) the ionization parameter ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , which is defined as the ratio of the ionizing photon density to the electron density , ( 3 ) the thickness of the torus component which is represented by the optical depth for ionizing photons , ( 4 ) the chemical compositions of the gas , ( 5 ) the shape of the input sed of ionizing photons , and ( 6 ) the fraction of dc to the nlr component .    here",
    "we assume @xmath41 @xmath5 .",
    "we perform several model runs covering 10@xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath5 .",
    "the ionization parameter of the nlr component is assumed as @xmath44 .",
    "the ionization parameter and the hydrogen column density of dc are determined using following two conditions ; ( [ fe x]@xmath06374/[fe vii]@xmath06087)@xmath45 = 0.8 and ( [ fe vii]@xmath06087/[o iii]@xmath05007)@xmath45 = 1.0 .",
    "the former ratio is the typical value of seyfert galaxies ( nagao et al .",
    "2000c ) and the latter condition is introduced by murayama & taniguchi ( 1998b ) as a truncated dense gas cloud .",
    "as the result , @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath48 are adopted@xmath06374 emission , the derived values of @xmath39 and @xmath49 may also suffer such uncertainties . ]",
    "( see figure 10 ) .",
    "the calculations are stopped when the gas temperature falls to 4000 k for the nlr component .",
    "we set the gas - phase elemental abundances to be solar ones taken from grevesse & anders ( 1989 ) with extensions by grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "we adopt the power - law continuum as the input spectrum , where the spectral index is assumed as @xmath50 = 1.5 ( see ferland & netzer 1983 ) between 10 @xmath15 m and 50 kev for the form @xmath51 .",
    "the spectral index is set to @xmath50 = 2.5 at lower energy ( i.e. , @xmath52 m ) and to @xmath50 = 2 at higher energy ( i.e. , @xmath53 50 kev ) . the fraction of dc to the nlr component is treated as a free parameter in our calculations .",
    "the further details for this dual - component photoionization model are described in murayama ( 1998 ) and murayama & taniguchi ( 1998b ) .",
    "we present our results of model calculations and compare them with the observations in figure 12 , which is a diagram of @xmath1 versus [ fe vii]@xmath06087/[o iii]@xmath05007 .",
    "we find that the model grids are roughly consistent with the observations if we take the effects of the correction for the extinction into account .",
    "though the dispersion of observation is larger than the model grids , this is thought to be attributed the fact that the parameters , such as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath37 , and @xmath49 , are different from object to object .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath1 of the s1s can be explained by introducing a 5% @xmath54 20% contribution from dc while the @xmath1 of the s2s can be explained by introducing a 0% @xmath54 2% contribution from dc .",
    "these fractions are consistent with the results of murayama & taniguchi ( 1998b ) , who introduce a @xmath55 contribution from the dense gas clouds to explain intensities of the hiner emission of s1s .",

    "this suggests that liners may also possess high - density regions up to 10@xmath58 @xmath5 , which mean that the high @xmath1 in liners may be explained by photoionization models .    although it is not clear whether or not there is a dusty torus in all liners , there is several pieces of evidence that the unified models of agns can apply to some of liners ; i.e. , some liners exhibit broad components in their optical spectra ( e.g. , ho et al .",
    "1997b ) , in uv spectra ( e.g. , barth et al . 1996 ) , or only in polarized spectra ( barth , filippenko , & moran 1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "therefore it is interesting to examine the properties of @xmath1 of liners in the framework of our dual component model .    in order to investigate this issue ,",
    "we compiled @xmath1 of liners from the literature . since the optical spectra of liners are often contaminated by stellar features from the host galaxy strongly , careful subtraction of such stellar features from observed spectra is needed to discuss the properties of faint emission lines such as [ o iii]@xmath04363 .",
    "our compiled sample consists of the objects that such careful subtraction was applied to ; 8 liners with broad components ( l1.9s ) and 7 liners without broad components ( l2s ) . here",
    "it must be kept in mind that some of the l2s may not be agns ; a part of liners may be shock - heated galaxy ( e.g. , heckman 1980 ; baldwin et al .",

    "2000 ; taniguchi , shioya , & murayama 2000 ) .",
    "it is noted that the compiled samples may be biased in favor of the higher @xmath1 objects because it is often difficult to detect weak [ o iii]@xmath04363 emission owing to the relatively strong stellar feature .",
    "the objects we compiled are given in table 7 , and the histograms of @xmath1 for the l1.9s and the l2s are shown in figure 13 . the means and the deviations of @xmath1 are 0.099 @xmath16 0.054 for the l1.9s and 0.048 @xmath16 0.030 for the l2s .",
