    "one of the main barriers for the wide spread use of high - intensity focused ultrasound ( hifu ) has been the lack of robust , reliable and cost - efficient monitoring methods .",
    "monitoring hifu therapy requires real - time imaging which can provide feedback as to the state of the tissue either in the form of temperature data or by determining changes in the physical properties of tissue .",
    "ultrasound can be used to provide temperature information , but this has been found to be accurate only at hyperthermic temperatures below 50 @xmath0c @xcite . in the case where lesions are echogenic , b - mode imaging can be used to monitor hifu . however , in the absence of cavitation lesions are not always visible @xcite .    one tissue property that has been shown to change significantly and irreversibly after thermal ablation is tissue stiffness @xcite . the increase in stiffness",
    "has been shown to be reversible at temperatures below 60 @xmath0c @xcite , and irreversible once temperatures exceed 60 @xmath0c due to collagen denaturation @xcite .",

    "the temperature dependence of the deformation is affected by the changes in the sound speed , attenuation and elasticity , and therefore , extracting temperature from measured deformation is challenging .    the first aim of this study is to quantify the temperature dependence of acoustic and viscoelastic tissue parameters affecting arf induced displacements .",
    "this is conducted by summarising the existing data on acoustic and elastic properties available in the literature .",

    "finally , the characteristics of the experimental hmi data are modelled by viscoelastic finite element method ( fem ) simulations using temperature dependent acoustic and viscoelastic parameters .",
    "according to ( [ eq : arf ] ) the magnitude of the arf is directly dependent on absorption of tissue .",

    "the stiffness changes at temperatures above 45 @xmath0c were found to be irreversible .",
    "this is due to protein denaturation and tissue necrosis forming a coagulated region which consequently leads to increase in stiffness @xcite .",

    "the motivation of this study was to investigate how these changes in acoustic and viscoelastic tissue parameters affect the arf induced displacements during hifu therapy . for this purpose hmi was used to monitor thermal ablation with real - time temperature data collected using an embedded thermocouple in _ ex vivo _ liver .",
    "the temperature acquisition using this method has been shown to suffer from so - called viscous heating artefact @xcite , which can potentially lead to an error in the measured temperature value .",
    "however , this error has been shown to be significant only during the initial few seconds of the sonication @xcite and with the 60-second sonications employed here the effect should be less than a few degrees along the temperature axis .    during hifu thermal ablation the displacement amplitude was observed to decrease slightly with temperature up to 45 - 50 @xmath0c after which an increase to about 60 - 70 @xmath0c was seen followed by a steep decrease due to thermal necrosis @xcite .",

    "the initial slight decrease in the amplitude is not always reported , but has been found to occur in some cases @xcite . the increase in displacement amplitude before necrosis could potentially be due to tissue softening at low temperatures as observed by @xcite in _ ex vivo _ bovine muscle , but this phenomenon has not been found in liver @xcite . furthermore , the viscoelastic measurements conducted in this and other studies @xcite do not support this hypothesis . the slight decrease and following increase in the displacement amplitude before thermal necrosis is therefore more likely to be caused due the behaviour of attenuation with temperature which exhibits a similar trend @xcite .",
    "the changes in viscoelasticity likely do not have a significant effect until the lesion starts to grow which will only occur later in the sonication .    to better understand how these different tissue properties affect the arf induced displacements in liver a linear viscoelastic fem model together with nonlinear acoustic simulations",

    "the effect of temperature dependent sound speed and attenuation power law coefficient on displacement amplitude were found to be minimal , and thus , they were left out from the simulation model . furthermore , the effect of thermal lensing @xcite was not taken into account which could potentially shift the focal point of the ultrasound field with temperature .",
    "the magnitude of focal shift due to thermal lensing is related to the ultrasound frequency and f - number of the transducer which , for the configuration used here , should result in a few millimetre axial shift of the ultrasound focal point towards the transducer during sonication . in practice",
    "this would mean that the lesion would slightly spread in size towards the transducer .",
    "this could potentially lead to slightly lower displacement amplitudes than shown in the simulation results due to the error in the lesion size .",
    "the simulated displacement amplitudes in liver were seen to decrease up to 40 - 45 @xmath0c together with the attenuation where it reached its local minimum .",
    "the decrease in simulated displacement amplitude was observed to be approximately 5% which is larger compared to experimentally observed @xmath481% average decrease .",
    "this is probably because the viscoelastic properties of liver were kept constant while only the value of attenuation was changed . in reality",
    ", the heating of the liver in the ultrasound focal point would cause slight changes in the viscoelasticity before the ablation , which are likely to counteract the effect of attenuation changes .",
    "after 45 @xmath0c the attenuation started to increase which also caused the displacement amplitude to increase up to 55 @xmath0c .",
    "similar increasing amplitude was also seen in the experimental data where the peak occurred approximately at 60 - 70 @xmath0c .",
    "the difference in the peak location on temperature axis is probably due to different transducer configuration and therapeutic geometry between the experiments and simulations , which cause differences in the lesion size .",
    "however , the magnitude of the increase was similar in both the experimental and simulation data with both showing approximately 3 - 5% increase .",
    "there is a large deviation in the experimental displacement values in the 60 - 70 @xmath0c temperature region , which indicates peaking ( and hence thermal ablation ) does not occur at constant temperature .",
    "therefore , it is important to record the whole time history of the displacement data to ascertain when the ablation occurs .",
    "furthermore , there is a threshold in the lesion size ( i.e. , 240 cem@xmath44 volume ) which starts to cause the decrease in the displacement amplitude , but its determination requires further research .    after 55 @xmath0c",
    "the attenuation further increased but simultaneously a lesion started to develop causing the displacement amplitude to rapidly decrease as the increasing stiffness of the lesion outweighs the effect of increasing attenuation .",
    "the decrease in amplitude was observed to be approximately 51% in the simulations while experimental data showed larger variation of 6 - 42% decrease .",
    "the final simulation study considered how the displacement amplitudes behave in the situation after hifu therapy where one large lesion or multiple small lesions are next to each other .",
    "for this purpose the typical ranges in attenuation and elastic modulus in liver were used .",
    "the regions before and after thermal ablation were found to overlap slightly , although this was partly due to the relatively high elastic modulus values found in the literature for normal liver @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the large deviation in the attenuation coefficient also makes the two regions to overlap .",
    "when looking at the average values the simulations predicted a 30% decrease in displacement after ablation .",
    "however , the 5 , 10 and 15 @xmath47 m contours traverse both regions of non - ablated and ablated tissue , i.e. , the blue and the red rectangles .",
    "this suggests that looking only at the changes in arf induced displacement before and after thermal ablation is not enough to determine whether the tissue has undergone ablation , but rather the whole time history of the displacement during the ablation should be considered .",
    "the effect of temperature dependent acoustic and viscoelastic tissue parameters on arf induced displacements in liver was studied .",
    "the temperature dependent tissue properties that will most strongly affect the magnitude of arf induced displacements were found to be attenuation and viscoelasticity .",
    "the effect of temperature dependent attenuation power law coefficient and sound speed were found to be negligible .    experimental hmi data during hifu ablation in _ ex vivo _ liver showed a small but detectable decrease and increase in the displacement amplitude at low temperatures below 60 - 70 @xmath0c followed by a more pronounced decrease due to thermal ablation .",
    "the viscoelastic simulation model , employing temperature dependent tissue parameters , exhibited similar behaviour with attenuation affecting the displacement amplitude at lower temperatures before thermal ablation . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the lesion growth together with the exponentially increasing elastic modulus overpowered the changes in attenuation .    at temperatures above 60",
    "@xmath0c the experimental hmi data showed large deviation in the displacement amplitude . both experimental data and numerical simulations",
    "indicate that monitoring displacement before and after hifu ablation is not sufficient to determine the state of ablation .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that monitoring arf induced displacements continuously during thermal ablation is necessary in order to ascertain when ablation occurs .",

    "<S> multiple ultrasound elastography techniques rely on acoustic radiation force ( arf ) in monitoring high - intensity focused ultrasound ( hifu ) therapy . </S>",
    "<S> however , arf is dependent on tissue attenuation and sound speed , both of which are also known to change with temperature making the therapy monitoring more challenging . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the viscoelastic properties of tissue are also temperature dependent , which affects the displacements induced by arf . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this study is to quantify the temperature dependent changes in the acoustic and viscoelastic properties of liver and investigate their effect on arf induced displacements by using both experimental methods and simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the temperature dependent viscoelastic properties of liver are experimentally measured over a frequency range of 0.1 - 200 hz at temperatures reaching 80 @xmath0c , and both conventional and fractional zener models are used to fit the data .    </S>",
    "<S> the fractional zener model was found to fit better with the experimental viscoelasticity data with respect to the conventional model with up to two magnitudes lower sum of squared errors ( sse ) . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristics of experimental displacement data were also seen in the simulations due to the changes in attenuation coefficient and lesion development . at low temperatures before thermal ablation , attenuation was found to affect the displacement amplitude . at higher temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in displacement amplitude occurs approximately at 60 - 70 @xmath0c due to the combined effect of viscoelasticity changes and lesion growth overpowering the effect of attenuation . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that it is necessary to monitor displacement continuously during hifu therapy in order to ascertain when ablation occurs .    </S>",
