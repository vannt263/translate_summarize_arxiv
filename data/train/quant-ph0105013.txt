    "in this paper some principles underpinning the running of the universe on a fundamental level are discussed .",
    "these are related to ideas about discrete spacetime discussed recently by various authors [ 1 - 5 ] but important differences exist .",
    "in particular , it is assumed here that the universe runs according to the following principle encapsulated by bragg @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * bragg s principle : *  _ everything in the future is a wave , everything in the past is a particle_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    whilst matters can not be quite as simple as that , this principle says that quantum processes define the fleeting moment of the present , which is the transition from the unformed and uncertain future to a classically fixed and unique past @xcite . in other words , time is a quantum phenomenon .",
    "bragg s principle reflects the human experience of time , the feeling that the past and the future are neither equivalent nor symmetric about the present , contrary to the temporal symmetry inherent in classical mechanics .",
    "for example , maxwell s equations have both advanced and retarded solutions , requiring the former to be excluded by hand in order to retain classical causality . despite such examples and",
    "the fact that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics makes a distinction between the past and the future , state reduction ( wave - function collapse ) is commonly regarded as an ugly idea best eliminated if possible from an otherwise elegant theory .",
    "the problem comes from the concept of _ observer _ in quantum mechanics .",
    "observers are free to prepare various states and then decide on various experiments to do on them .",
    "this adds an unfortunate flavour to an otherwise mathematically elegant theory because of its undertones of subjectivity tacked onto an objective physics .",
    "state reduction as the origin of time has been discussed before @xcite but in the context of continuous time . in this paper",
    "the spacetime continuum is anathema and time is treated as a quantum phenomenon .",
    "however , there is no `` particle of time '' or _",
    "neither is there any operator of time .",
    "instead , a fundamental discrete topological measure of time occurs , called a _",
    "q - tick _ , or _ quantum tick . _",
    "the peculiarity of the q - tick is that it has a variable conventional temporal measure , depending on the context in which it is experienced .",
    "an _ emergent _ quantity is something which is not in itself fundamental but the consequence of more fundamental processes .",
    "emergence can relate to laws of physics , theories and conceptual structures such as continuous spacetime .",
    "for example , the continuum theory of fluid mechanics must be an emergent theory because fluids consist of atoms and molecules.@xmath0    this leads to a principle which has been suggested in [ 9,10 ] and many other papers too numerous to list :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * the principle of emergence : * _ _ because they themselves are emergent phenomena , _ _ * *  * * _ humans perceive _ ( _ most of _ ) _ the universe in emergent terms . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this does not say that emergent concepts are wrong but warns about the use of them in the formulation of fundamental laws .",
    "an example is the concept of observer _ _  _ _ in quantum mechanics . amongst its virtues , quantum mechanics",
    "is pre - occupied with what goes on in the laboratory and the notion of observer is based on the actions of real physicists as they prepare states and then perform tests on them .",
    "the problem arises because physicists are themselves emergent phenomena .",
    "this has led to an unsatisfactory mixture of classical and quantum concepts resulting in the measurement problem in quantum mechanics . in this paper a more fundamental , mechanistic view of the observer",
    "is taken .      as a corollary of the principle of emergence",
    ", consciousness has to be recognized as an emergent phenomenon , contrary to notions currently being taken seriously in various circles @xcite .",
    "it can not be an accident that physics has made spectacular progress without incorporating consciousness directly into any of its mechanistic laws ( except for the concept of observer in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "moreover , neuroscientific evidence exists for the idea that consciousness arises as a secondary process following prior processing in the subconscious @xcite .",
    "even if new physics were necessary to explain consciousness , as suggested in @xcite and @xcite , such physics would be in accordance with the machine principle , stated below .",
    "the laws of physics on a fundamental level must be sufficient to account for consciousness @xcite and all other emergent quantities .",
    "the elimination of consciousness from fundamental physics raises the question of the status of the observer in quantum mechanics . in the standard formulation @xcite ,",
    "a typical quantum experiment goes as follows .",
    "first , at initial time @xmath1 , a semi - classical observer prepares a system in some initial state represented by a state vector @xmath2 in some hilbert space @xmath3 . then the system is left _",
    "completely _ alone until some later time @xmath4 at which time the observer arranges a test @xmath5 of the system . according to quantum principles",
    "this will have one outcome from a number of possibilities .",
    "the test is represented mathematically by some hermitian operator @xmath6 acting on elements of @xmath3 , and it is a fundamental postulate that any possible outcome is an eigenstate @xmath7 of this operator , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is real and represents a classical outcome of the test .",
    "it is beyond the black arts of quantum mechanics to predict which individual outcome will occur in any single run of a test .",
    "it is only when the experiment is repeated many times that the relative conditional probabilities @xmath10 of the various outcomes manifest themselves .    because observers in quantum mechanics appear to have complete freedom in deciding which states to prepare and",
    "then which tests to apply to them , there quite naturally arises the notion that consciousness and free will should have a role in the principles of the subject @xcite .",
    "this may be valid on the emergent level but must be incorrect on the fundamental level . consider the decay of an unstable particle such as the neutral pion .",
    "when a @xmath11 is created in some particle experiment , it will decay into one of a number of possible channels , such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 , amongst others .",
    "particle tables give branching ratios for these various decays .",
    "the decay process may be regarded as a test of the free pion state , but no consciousness is involved in setting up this test .",
    "its set of possible outcomes does not appear to be determined by external factors , and certainly not by the experimentalists .",
    "it must be determined by the fundamental laws of the universe .",
    "given that there are no hidden variables , the conclusion is that the act of preparation of a free @xmath11 itself determines in some way the test involved .",
    "such reflections on tests and observers lead to the following :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * the machine principle * : _ the universe runs as a quantum automaton , preparing its own states and the tests of those states .",
    "conscious observers are emergent complexes of states and tests and are not necessary to the running of the universe . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    there is no need for semi - classical observers according to this principle .",
    "the evidence is clear in the red shift of the galaxies and the fossil record .",
    "no human observers were present in the remote past , and it is safe to say that no other forms of consciousness doing physics experiments were present either .",
    "things just _ happened _ during the normal running of the universe .",
    "emergent structures such as observers are not excluded by the machine principle , however .",
    "consciousness is an empirical fact , as is the existence of physicists who decide on what sort of experiments to do in their laboratories .",
    "the principle of emergence and the machine principle lead to a two level view of the universe . on the fundamental level it runs as a self - organizing system and the spacetime continuum does not exist . on the emergent level , the universe forms transient patterns which appear conscious and to have free will .",
    "these are the traditional semi - classical observers used in discussions of orthodox quantum mechanics .",
    "these observers imagine that spacetime is continuous , that they are embedded in it , and that they can decide on which states to prepare and what tests to perform on them . fortunately , because such emergent observers emerge from quantum processes which are inherently unpredictable , the actions of these observers are not deterministic , though often highly predictable .",
    "humans are not mere automatons , for the essential reason that the running of the universe is * not * quite like a classical cellular automaton @xcite .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath14 of a hermitian operator @xmath6 representing a test @xmath5  form a complete set , which may be assumed orthonormal .",
    "therefore , any state @xmath15being tested can be written as a linear superposition of those eigenstates , @xmath16 where the coefficients @xmath17 are complex numbers .",
    "two points of interpretation can be made here :    1 .",
    "the probability @xmath18 of the test having outcome @xmath7 is given by @xmath19 if the test is performed by an emergent observer , then the observer can decide to perform the test many times , and home in on these probabilities in terms of frequencies . if however the test occurs because of the machine running of the universe , the notion of probability is meaningful for the very good reason that the universe will sooner or later run through the same test on an equivalent state a vast number of times throughout its history ; 2 .",
    "a particular outcome such as @xmath7 of a test can be considered as having occurred because the initial state @xmath20 was in that state @xmath7 all along , in a quantum sense .",
    "the purpose of a test becomes simply to filter out this component from the other states in the superposition @xmath21 .",
    "+ this point of view is retrospective , in that it considers a test as an examination of what is already there , vis .",
    ", the state being tested .",
    "an alternative view would be to look the other way .",
    "in this view , a test such as @xmath5 is something which deals with the possible future and not the past .",
    "the role of the initial state is now simply to provide information which helps inform @xmath5 .",
    "this information is just one component of perhaps a vast amount of information obtained from other events and tests which is needed to construct or define the test @xmath5 of possible future outcomes .",
    "from this point of view , a test is more like a gateway or portal to the future .",
    "the spectrum of eigenvalues associated with a test represents information about that test and its possible future outcomes , and not about the initial state being tested per se .",
    "the fact that the spectrum of eigenvalues of an observable is independent of any state being tested is consistent with this alternative view .",
    "this way of looking at the process of `` measurement '' ( a misnomer from this point of view ) makes sense when the question arises of incompatible tests such as position and momentum measurement for a particle .",
    "it is not the case that a state of a particle `` can not have both definite position and momentum '' .",
    "it does nt have either , as the kochen - specker theorem suggests @xcite .",
    "rather , position and momentum tests are incompatible and so it is not possible to have a test with an outcome which is simultaneously an eigenstate of position and momentum .",
    "this is essentially bohr s position on the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox .",
    "any experiment in this view , therefore , is not about looking into the properties of a state constructed in the past but about looking into the future and providing opportunities for one of the alternatives to become real .",
    "nevertheless , the term _ test _ for this process will be retained to avoid confusion .",
    "information from the active present ( defined below ) is used by the machine universe to test for the future .",
    "this information determines tests , not the outcomes of those tests ( which is the quantum part of the running of the universe ) .",
    "the notion of information used here is essentially the same as given by deutsch @xcite and may be summarized as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a test _ @xmath22 _ contains information about an event _ @xmath23 _ or some other test _ @xmath24 _ if any counterfactual change in _",
    "@xmath23 _ or _",
    "@xmath24 _ would change the possible outcomes of _ @xmath22 _ in a physically meaningful way .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    information as discussed here always comes in a classical form , which means that it is always certain ( even if unknown to some emergent observer ) .",
    "this includes state vectors , which represent pure states and which are equivalent to having a maximal amount of information in the quantum sense . knowing that a system is in a definite state @xmath25 is equivalent to having a piece of classical information .",
    "an example of a counterfactual change in an event which would not have any physically meaningful effect is multiplication of its event state by an arbitrary phase .",
    "this would have no effect on the probability of any outcome of any test of that state .",
    "it is not the case that the only information of physical value consists of expectation values . in the real world , a single outcome of a single experiment gives real , physically meaningful information content .",
    "it is possible to be sure for example that a single electron has emerged from a stern - gerlach experiment in a spin up state simply by blocking off the down beam .",
    "such a process is known as state preparation .",
    "when more than one outcome is possible however , which one occurs in reality is not predictable usually from quantum mechanics .",
    "it is customary to take the view that the only thing that matters is the observer s knowledge about the initial state , which comes down eventually to probabilities @xcite",
    ". this can not be the entire story , as will be argued below .",
    "the transition from a prepared quantum state to one of its possible quantum outcomes following a test will be defined as one tick of a fundamental quantum clock , _ regardless of what the process is_. such a tick will be called a _",
    "q - tick _ ( _ quantum tick _ ) .",
    "for example , a neutral pion decaying into two photons represents one q - tick .",
    "a uranium atom decaying after ten thousand years also represents one q - tick .",
    "a photon passing from a source through a double slit and impinging on a screen also takes one q - tick .",
    "a photon emitted from a quasar eleven billion years ago impinging on our retina now takes precisely one q - tick to do so .",
    "what determines a q - tick is irreversible information transfer , which occurs in one of two distinct ways .",
    "first , old information from events and states in the active present is used by the self - testing machine universe to define new tests of itself .",
    "second , new information is created when quantum outcomes of those tests occur .",
    "if a process involves no real physical information transfer beyond a given test to the wider universe , then no q - tick is counted .",
    "for example , if an outcome of some test is subsequently passed through a second , identical test then no new information can be extracted from that second test .",
    "therefore this double test involves only one q - tick .",
    "an application of this principle occurs when feynman diagrams are used to discuss scattering processes in elementary particle physics .",
    "such a process involves a single q - tick lasting from laboratory time @xmath26 to time @xmath27 .",
    "the number of vertices in feynman diagrams can not be a physically meaningful quantity @xcite .",
    "the essential point is not that a q - tick takes any specific externally measurable time , but that it represents the appearance of new information with the resolution of a single quantum outcome in some quantum test .      from the point of view of the theory being discussed here , the spacetime continuum does not exist and quantum non - locality in time as well as space",
    "is assumed to be meaningful .",
    "bohr realized that there was a truly terrifying implication of quantum mechanics : in between the preparation of a state of a system and the testing of an outcome , the system can not exist or be real in any classical sense .",
    "the act of observation itself creates the reality being observed .",
    "this leads to another fundamental principle :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * the copenhagen principle : * _ reality does not exist during a q - tick , but only at the end of a q - tick .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the fundamental question now is , what does it mean to say that an outcome exists ?",
    "three points of view are possible .",
    "adherents of the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics would say that all outcomes of a test occur , each in its own universe @xmath28 $ ] , whereas many traditionalists would say that a state is not an objective property of an individual system but a construct of an observer , with state reduction taking place only in the consciousness of the observer @xcite .",
    "other traditionalists would argue that an actual outcome at the end of a q - tick is a real physical event .    both of the last two views are in accordance with the machine principle , and relate to the two levels of looking at the universe . on the emergent level",
    ", observers deal with information and process it as they themselves evolve in time . on the fundamental level ,",
    "quantum outcomes occur physically in the machine running of the universe",
    ".    it does not matter that an outcome can not be quite like a classical measurement , because by standard quantum principles only half of available phase space can be certain at any time .",
    "nevertheless , _ something very real occurs _ in an irreversible way .",
    "a photon going through a double slit experiment and impacting on a photographic plate does so in a very definite part of the plate .",
    "this is what bragg s principle means . in any discussion of wave - particle duality",
    ", the particle aspect makes sense only _",
    "after _ something has occurred , and then the wave aspect is no longer needed .",
    "past and future are indeed distinguished by state reduction .",
    "bohr s ideas are part of what is now known as the copenhagen interpretation . taken in its extreme form",
    ", this says that there is no way of influencing any single outcome of an experiment directly , not because of any limitation on our part , but because the outcome _ simply does not exist until it occurs_. q - ticks are intervals of non - existence",
    ".    however , this can not be the complete picture .",
    "whilst there are no hidden variables existing as a substrate of reality , information coming from the past must somehow be causally involved in deciding the range of possible outcomes at the end of a q - tick .",
    "this is no more radical an idea than the use of the schrdinger equation to determine a future state vector , or the heisenberg operator equation to determine quantum operators at future times .",
    "a differential equation is just another way of propagating classical information available at some initial time forwards into the future , and this information / memory occurs in the form of boundary conditions formulated in the past .",
    "this information represents the particle aspect of bragg s principle . the way that it is used to predict the future concerns the wave aspect of bragg s principle .",
    "moreover , when such differential equations are discretized they appear to all intents and purposes as examples of generalized cellular automata @xcite .",
    "none of these deterministic models gives any statement about actually what happens at the future end of a single q - tick , which is why the state reduction concept appears as a blemish in an otherwise elegant picture .",
    "attempts to move away from the copenhagen interpretation , such as hidden variables theories or the many worlds interpretation , are really attempts to avoid the conclusion that reality has no existence until resolution occurs .",
    "given that quantum processes underpin all of the properties of the universe , then continuous spacetime must be an emergent concept .",
    "this in turn implies that the concept of metric and even the dimension of space are also emergent .    the notion that length represents a counting process of elementary units has been attributed to riemann @xcite",
    "this would help solve the problem of where a fundamental scale comes from .",
    "a counting process has no scale .",
    "physicists would also like to have a dynamical explanation of why physical space is three dimensional on emergent scales . currently , extra dimensions are regarded favourably by physicists , and this is consistent with the notion discussed by bombelli et al @xcite that discrete sets with some concept of ordering ( causal sets ) can have emergent dimensions which differ on different emergent scales .",
    "it is possible that the dimensional regularization method used in the regularization of quantum field theories works not because of some special mathematical trickery , but because spacetime dimension really is an emergent quantity and this particular regularization process is homing in onto this somehow .",
    "these considerations lead to a picture of the universe as a collection of discrete objects called _ events _ and discrete quantum processes called _ tests .",
    "_ events come in many varieties and so should not be visualized as necessarily points in or of spacetime .",
    "so what are they ?",
    "recall first a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics called _ entanglement , _ which does not occur in classical mechanics . _",
    "_  _ _ in quantum mechanics _",
    "_  _ _ it is possible to have a state which is not a single tensor product state of more elementary vectors , such as @xmath29 but an entangled one , such as @xmath30 .",
    "such an entangled state can not be described as a direct product by any linear change of basis .",
    "given that the universe is a quantum one , then it should be describable in terms of some state @xmath31 at a given time@xmath32 this may be regarded as a single event .",
    "now if the universe were in a completely entangled state then there would be no possibility of dividing it in constituent parts on the fundamental level .",
    "fortunately , the universe seems to be divisible into systems and observers on emergent scales and so this property is assumed to hold at the fundamental level also .",
    "this is the most critical assumption made in this paper . without it no further discussion",
    "would be possible .",
    "it is an example of fourier s principle of similitude @xcite , applied in a quantum context .",
    "it is conceivable , after all , that the factorization into observers and systems on emergent scales is itself an emergent property not holding at the fundamental level .",
    "the state of the universe @xmath31 is assumed here to factor out into a direct product of a vast number of factor states : @xmath33 the factor states @xmath34 in this product are what is meant by _ events _ in this paper__.  _ _ many of these factor states may themselves be entangled products of even more elementary states , but others will be fundamental themselves or even direct products .",
    "how the event structure is factored depends on the context of the discussion , and in a sense it does not matter .",
    "it will be obvious from this why the discrete objects in this theory can not be identified with points in a discrete spacetime _ per se_.",
    "the matter is more subtle than that .",
    "quantum processes represent the moment of the present , and so the event structure of the universe has a temporal aspect and may be discussed at different stages of its temporal evolution .",
    "emergent time splits into past , present and future , and likewise , events fall into three categories . at a given stage in the history of the universe ,",
    "_ past events _ are all those events relating to the particle aspect of bragg s principle .",
    "these play no further role in forming the future , at that stage .",
    "_ active events _ are events which are involved in determining tests for as yet unresolved future events and form the _ active present _ , at the same stage .",
    "finally , _ future events _ are hypothetical events which may be outcomes of tests and do not yet have any physical resolution , again at that stage .",
    "the temporal status of an event therefore depends on the stage at which the universe is being discussed .    the discrete topological relationships between events ( which were called _ links _ in _",
    "_  _ _ @xcite ) _ _  _ _ are as important to the running of the universe as its events structure .",
    "links represent tests which the machine running of the universe sets up before _ q - ticks _ occur .",
    "the result of such a test is an outcome at the end of a q - tick , that is , a resolution from a set of possible future events into a single real one .",
    "the diagrammatic notation introduced in @xcite may be used to clarify discussions of temporal processes .",
    "the interpretation of these diagrams is somewhat different now because quantum mechanics has been introduced into the theory .",

    "the entire process could follow an alternative path , given by figure @xmath196 the two diagrams , figures @xmath164 and @xmath165 suggest that such experiments can not be carried out absolutely simultaneously in terms of q - ticks at different parts of the universe .",
    "this is nothing to do with relativity at all .",
    "one of the tests must always be one q - tick later than the other .",
    "this is a topological relationship between outcomes of tests , and in that sense involves the structure of spacetime .",
    "co - ordinate or laboratory times estimated by the two emergent observers relate to emergent descriptions of the universe .",
    "they may appear to be simultaneous to all intents and purposes , because they count time in terms of vast numbers of q - ticks , most of which may be thought of as occurring on planck scales .",
    "it is conceivable that one day technology might be found to establish whether these topological structures are relevant in such processes , but it likely that there might be no way in principle of determining whether process @xmath164 or @xmath165 had occurred in an actual run of the experiment .",
    "it is possible that the choice of which of these processes is actually taken by the running of the universe may itself be thought as the outcome of some higher order quantum test .",
    "this would perhaps be equivalent to `` second quantization '' , i.e. , a quantum test whose outcomes are themselves different tests , rather than states .",
    "since these tests involve different topologies , as in figures @xmath164 and @xmath165 , there is here a scenario for an approach to quantum spacetime topology , otherwise known as quantum gravity . that is outside the scope of this paper and is a matter reserved for the future .",
    "discussions of bell inequalities will remain unchanged in the approach discussed here , because all the standard correlations of quantum mechanics will be reproduced .",
    "what the diagrammatic approach taken here has done is to emphasize why these correlations should occur .",
    "these inequalities deal with expectation values , so they refer to emergent processes .",
    "these can be dealt with straightforwardly here because the machine principle does not excluded the emergent level .",
    "the use of emergent observers in the discussion validates a discussion of probabilities , because these observers can make the choice of repeating experiments such as the one discussed above .",
    "these ideas can be applied to particle decays and scattering processes . consider the former .",
    "the question of particle decay lifetime involves a balance of heuristics and formal theory , because the interpretation of what is going on lies on the borderline between the classical and the quantum . according to the notion of a q - tick , an elementary particle decay involves one q - tick , whereas conventional time is measured on emergent scales and normally involves vast numbers of q - ticks .",
    "the question arises as to what the physical meaning of decay lifetime is .",
    "the answer comes from the heisenberg picture in quantum mechanics . in this picture ,",
    "a state remains frozen in time and all the time dependence is transferred onto the observables , the physical operators of the theory .",
    "this is in line with the approach taken in this paper .",
    "observables represent tests , and their time dependence is a manifestation of time as it runs in the universe external to the state being observed .",
    "it is useful to review briefly the usual approach to particle decays from both the schrdinger and heisenberg pictures .      in this picture",
    "an initial state @xmath76 is prepared at time @xmath197and allowed to evolve quantum mechanically until a final time @xmath198 , at which time the evolved state @xmath199is tested to see if it has decayed .",
    "suppose the decayed state looked for is @xmath200 .",
    "this state may be assumed an eigenstate of some operator @xmath201 , vis , @xmath202 then the probability @xmath203 that the outcome of the test is @xmath204 is just @xmath205 is the time evolution operator . in this picture",
    ", the initial state is assumed to change in time according to the rule @xmath206 the probability @xmath203 is then transformed via a conventional heuristic formalism into the decay lifetime associated with the transition @xmath207    a particularly subtle point is this . in this scenario , there is a vast amount of information assumed about the time evolution and the measurement process , which is understood by experimentalists and theorists intuitively , but which is not mathematically incorporated into the formalism _ per se . _",
    "the physical interpretation of the probability @xmath208 is that it is the probability that a test made at time @xmath209 for the occurrence of state @xmath204 had a positive outcome , * given that no attempt had been made to look at the initial state up to that time and extract information about it*. this is classical information about what the * observers * have done or not done during the time interval @xmath210 $ ] .    in other words , even in the schrdinger picture , which gives the impression that the only time evolution occurring lies with the state , the behaviour of the observer in time is just as crucial . knowing that a test has * not * yet been done on a system is a piece of information which is just as important in a quantum measurement as knowing that a test has been done .",
    "this picture is fully consistent with the notion of a q - tick . in this picture ,",
    "all time dependence is transferred explicitly onto observers and tests .",
    "once prepared , an initial state is frozen until it is tested .",
    "this is much more natural a picture in terms of quantum principles than the schrdinger picture .",
    "it could be argued that latter is somewhat inconsistent , because a prepared state which is not being tested is effectively decoupled from the universe , so how could any sort of notion of time be associated with it ?",
    "how does an isolated state have any information about co - ordinate time , which is measured by on observer decoupled from that state ?    in the heisenberg picture ,  time runs for observers , and when they construct tests this time dependence is encoded in those tests . according to this picture ,",
    "the decay experiment discussed above is described as follows .",
    "first the observer constructs the state @xmath76 at time @xmath211 .",
    "this state is left completely alone until time @xmath212 at which time the observer tests for the probability that the initial state has component @xmath213 with the same eigenvalue @xmath214as in @xmath215 .",
    "it is the eigenvalue which identifies to the observer the state being measured .",
    "a solution is given by @xmath216 and so the probability of the transition occurring is exactly the same as for the schrdinger picture , equation @xmath217      from the point of view of the picture given in this paper , a decay experiment can be represented by a diagram such as figure @xmath218        here the observer runs as a quantum automaton from its initial configuration @xmath60 to some final configuration @xmath219 , via a vast number of q - tick processes , characterized by some integer @xmath220 , whereas the decays process takes precisely one q - tick on the fundamental level .",
    "almost certainly , @xmath220 would not be precise , not because of any uncertainty in the topology of events , but because time on a fundamental level in not integrable .",
    "however , on emergent scales , estimates of the average number of q - tick processes should be meaningful and it is these estimates which translate into estimates by emergent observers into their laboratory time .",
    "there is no fundamental scale per se in this framework , but if typical q - ticks associated with emergent observers were counted to be more - or - less equivalent to planck units , then the decay of a @xmath11 takes about @xmath221 of these observer q - ticks , i.e. , @xmath222    the test performed by @xmath219 will be represented by some operator @xmath223 , which carries information supplied by @xmath219 . if @xmath219 forms part of a sequence of observer events @xmath224 which is homogeneous in the sense that no radical changes occur in the laboratory environment associated with each element of this sequence , than the simplest ansatz which could be applied would be to take @xmath225 where @xmath100 is an elementary unitary time - step operator of the form discussed in @xcite .",
    "the picture which emerges corresponds precisely to the heisenberg picture in the continuous time formulation .",
    "a number of fundamental issues remain to be discussed in this framework , and these will be considered elsewhere .",
    "they include irreversibility , the early machine universe , schrdinger s cat , the quantum zeno effect , superselection rules and unbounded operators such as position and momentum .",
    "it is likely that the emphasis placed here on tests as much as on their outcomes should have a lot to say about some of these issues .",
    "for example , if the strong quantum principle holds , then the issue about the origin of the universe really concerns the test which produced the initial state , and not so much that initial state .",
    "likewise , the schrdinger s cat issue really concerns the physical existence or not of a test which could produce a state which was a linear combination of a living cat and a dead cat .",
    "if such a test can not be constructed physically , then the question of such a linear superposition does not arise .",
    "the same remark holds for superselection rules forbidding linear combinations of states with different electric charges .    on the physical meaning of time ,",
    "the position taken in this paper is that it is a real phenomenon and that the universe__runs__. this contrasts with some emergent theories such as general relativity , where general covariance leads to a view which is unsettling and counter intuitive .",
    "time appears to freeze out in such theories when quantisation is attempted .",
    "it should be noted that such a result can be found in any lagrangian model using dirac s reparametrisation method @xcite involving constraint mechanics , but that does not eliminate the physical reality of time in such models .    since time as discussed in this paper is not directly related to an integrable parameter except on emergent scales , an obvious conclusion is that the euclidean formulation of time , wherein real time is rotated into the imaginary axis , is meaningful only in an emergent context .",
    "theories which use it exclusively can not be truly fundamental .",
    "lattice gauge theories formulated on four dimensional euclidean lattices are reasonable because this approach is regarded as an approximation method .",
    "cosmological theories which are formulated exclusively in euclidean spacetimes must be regarded as unphysical from the point of view of this paper , as are attempts to regularize quantum gravity by appealing to imaginary time .",
    "finally , because in the framework discussed here time is the acquisition of quantum information , there is no scope here for closed timelike curves , and any theory which permits them must be emergent and therefore not fundamental .",
