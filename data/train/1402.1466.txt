    "one of the greatest challenges facing the millimeter wave ( mmw ) and especially the terahertz ( thz ) imaging communities is the restriction posed by the requirement to use expensive point detectors .",
    "the impressive scans of obscured objects frequently reported in the mmw and thz literature are usually obtained through slow raster scanning of a source , object , or detector , often taking hours or days to complete@xcite .",
    "although source power and detector sensitivity are improving , the rate - limiting factor remains the desired signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the scattered signal coupled with the limited mechanical scanning speed and/or the associated mechanical settling time before an acquisition can begin .",
    "although mechanical scanning is often the only practical strategy for obtaining an image of a complex scene with diverse spatial content , there are many problems where the imager is only being used to find isolated or sparsely - distributed scatterers in a visually opaque host .",
    "for example , one might wish to find nails behind wallpaper or metallic plumbing behind sheetrock .",
    "for such problems , it is impractical to raster scan large areas .",
    "coherent sources are common in the mmw and thz imaging bands , so synthetic aperture imaging may be used to overcome the limitation of sensing with a single , large , and expensive transceiver .",
    "the synthesized aperture can either use a diverging beam , as is typically done in synthetic aperture radar@xcite , or a quasi - optical system with a converging beam , as is done in optical coherence tomography ( oct ) to increase penetration depth in scattering media@xcite .",
    "the scanning time for synthetic aperture systems using classical processing techniques [ e.g. @xcite ] could be reduced if more powerful sources and more sensitive detectors were used , but that would greatly increase system cost .",
    "however , if the number of spatial samples could be reduced , it becomes more practical to use less expensive sources and detectors , especially if rapid mechanical scanning and efficient data processing are combined to reduce the time required to estimate a scene .",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) consists of estimation of @xmath0 signal values from @xmath1 measurements .",
    "cs has been used to improve sampling efficiency and increase temporal resolution in many imaging systems . a mathematical construct known as the restricted isometry property ( rip )",
    "rigorously allows compressive measurement of high dimensional data on lower dimensional spaces@xcite . by this construct",
    ", cs terminology has become widely used in analysis of signals sparse under @xmath2 constraints@xcite .",
    "previous demonstrations of compressive planar terahertz imaging @xcite , 3d holographic and millimeter wave tomography @xcite , and scanned interferometric tomography @xcite are particularly relevant to the @xmath2 construct .",
    "unfortunately , the sensing paradigms that provably obey rip generally rely either on random sensing modes@xcite , sensing modes that obey strict rules of incoherence@xcite , or special mode sets such as tight frames and related matrix constructs@xcite .    to make imaging as presented in @xcite practical ,",
    "we demonstrate here a compressive sampling technique to locate sparse point scatters with fewer spatial samples .",
    "compressive scanning for visible wavelength synthetic aperture imaging has already been presented in @xcite , but two aspects of that work are undesirable for mmw synthetic aperture imaging of point targets .",
    "one is the usual oct assumption that the beam is in the confocal space , which makes imaging of point targets compressively difficult due to the tightly confined lateral distribution of the beam .",
    "the other is the use of a random sampling set .",
    "while this may be a good strategy for certain cases , a random set of modes is not a highly optimized sampling strategy .",
    "an optimized sampling strategy would measure adaptively by taking into account the measurements already made to choose the next measurement from the available set of modes in an optimized way .    here",
    "we report a method for scanning a synthetic aperture adaptively when the scene complexity ( i.e. number of point scatterers ) is assumed to be known .",
    "first the measurement model is presented .",
    "the model is then taken as an input to the general framework specified by @xcite .",
    "the measurement model is then simplified to allow for easier implementation in the adaptive framework .",
    "experimental results are finally discussed , and the extension of this work to more complex targets is considered in light of the assumptions made .",
    "our goal is to locate a sparse array of scatterers as efficiently as possible using a synthetic aperture system with a single transceiver capable of sweeping frequency over a wide bandwidth attached to a linear stage .",
    "the transceiver produces a beam which is focused via a quasi - optical system into a sample , creating a gaussian beam . for a synthetic aperture system of this nature ,",
    "a measurement includes both input ( or system ) parameters @xmath3 such as system @xmath4 , wavenumber , etc . , and object parameters @xmath5 such as scatterer position and scattering strength .",
    "the @xmath6 measurement is then @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the measurement forward model which maps the input and object parameters to the dataset , and @xmath9 is a signal independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "white gaussian noise source @xmath10 .",

    "the square in the sum of eq . is from the fact that both the scene illumination and effective receiver gain pattern are assumed to have the same gaussian beam mode .",
    "the measurement system used in this study is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , and is discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] . for the purposes of this section all that is necessary",
    "is knowledge of the analytical acquisition model @xmath8 .        given @xmath8 ,",
    "the goal is to measure adaptively until the scene ( @xmath32 ) can be estimated reliably .",
    "to do so we adopt the methodology of adaptive estimation similar to the adaptive classification procedures first specified by @xcite and used for mine detection via electrostatics by @xcite .",
    "the methodology relies on the specified measurement model and existing data to specify a current estimate and a next best measurement location .",
    "the collection of all @xmath33 measurements defines the dataset @xmath34 for which the probability density function is defined as @xmath35.\\label{eq : likelihood}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to obtain an estimate @xmath36 for @xmath5 , a maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimate is used .",
    "given the posterior distribution @xmath37 the estimate must be @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a prior distribution on the object . in general @xmath39 may be any appropriate distribution for the object . for practical reasons to be explained",
    "shortly , the prior distribution is often chosen to be uniform or gaussian with mean zero .",
    "the experiments presented in this paper are concerned with detection of extremely sparse scatterers in two dimensions , lateral and depth , with the number of scatterers @xmath0 equal to 1 or 2 . when @xmath40 , the objective function is a measure of how well a single point with lateral position @xmath41 , depth position @xmath42 , and complex scattering strength @xmath43 match the data given the model @xmath44 , posing a 4-dimensional estimation problem . for @xmath45",
    "an 8 dimensional estimation problem must be solved , and for arbitrary @xmath0 @xmath46 parameters must be estimated .",
    "now given a current estimate , the adaptive method needs to decide where to measure next given the current estimate and @xmath47 . to achieve this goal",
    ", two primary assumptions will be made .",
    "the first is that the posterior distribution defined by eq .",
    "is approximately gaussian about mean @xmath36 with inverse covariance matrix @xmath48 @xmath49\\label{eq : posterior}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is essential because maximizing the determinant of this precision matrix @xmath48 has information theoretic significance @xcite",
    ". the exact significance of the determinant of the precision matrix is beyond the scope of this paper , but in simple terms it can be thought of as the aggregate precision over all of the parameters to be estimated . using the gaussian assumption , the form for the precision matrix",
    "is trivially derived from eq . as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an arbitrary constant . from eq . , eq .",
    "becomes @xmath52    since eq .",
    "describes @xmath53 , it could be substituted directly into eq . yielding a final form for the precision matrix . however , for this application it is necessary for the matrix to depend only on the current estimate of the object and the locations of the measurements previously taken .",
    "this can be achieved by the second necessary assumption that the model is linear about the estimate .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath8 about @xmath36 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the slope of the model about the estimate @xmath36 at location @xmath3 .",
    "of course this is a bad assumption for general models , but as the estimate is refined the assumption becomes better since changes in the estimate should be getting smaller if the algorithm is to converge .",
    "eq . is then applied to eq .",
    "using the new form for the model , and the precision matrix becomes @xmath56 which depends only on the current estimate @xmath36 and previous measurement locations @xmath57 .",
    "these properties , and the assumption that @xmath36 does not change drastically from measurement to measurement , allow for the precision matrix from the next measurement to be approximated as @xmath58 before the next measurement is taken , assuming @xmath59 is a constant or zero as happens when @xmath60 is uniform or gaussian as specified earlier .",
    "an optimal choice of @xmath61 would maximize the determinant of the precision matrix @xmath62 @xcite which is the solution to @xmath63 the procedure is iterated until convergence in the change of the determinant of the precision matrix is achieved",
    ".      the specified adaptation procedure will only be successful if an optimization routine can find a reliable solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : obj_function ] .",
    "[ fig : objective_funs](a ) shows a cut through the objective function specified in eq .",
    "after 8 simulated adaptive measurements , with @xmath8 specified by @xmath44 in eq . using a w - band system with a bandwidth of @xmath64ghz and @xmath4 of @xmath65 .",
    "the cut is the height of the objective function for varying estimates of @xmath41 and @xmath42 while holding the estimate of @xmath66 and @xmath67 constant .",
    "the true location of the scatterer is @xmath68 mm and @xmath69 cm .",
    "ideally this function would be a smooth bowl , allowing for a simple optimizer to use the gradient to find the minimum at the true location .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case for the objective function with @xmath8 represented by @xmath44 as the measurement model oscillates strongly because the measurement is made far from baseband ( @xmath70 @xmath71 ) .",
    "this can be corrected if we make the common oct assumption that the scatterers are nondispersive , allowing us to demodulate the model and perform data matching against a smoother function .",
    "[ fig : objective_funs](b ) shows cuts through the objective function for the same scenario as for fig .",

    "clearly this has greatly reduced axial oscillations in the objective function .",
    "however , there is another strongly contributing phase term in the gaussian beam equation : the transverse quadratic term in @xmath14 .",
    "oct usually works in the confocal region of the beam and does not have this term .",
    "to demodulate both the axial plane - wave and lateral quadratic terms of the gaussian beam , @xmath75 are subtracted from the phase .",

    "now that we have an objective function for the @xmath77 case , we need to verify that our assumptions will hold for two scatterers , especially when they are close to each other and the interference between them is strong .",
    "consider a second scatterer at @xmath78 mm and @xmath79 cm , approximately one beam waist away from the first scatterer still at @xmath80 mm and @xmath81 cm .",
    "[ fig : objective_funs](d ) shows a cut through the objective function with @xmath44 as @xmath8 in eq .",
    "after 12 simulated adaptive measurements",
    ". the cut plots the height of the objective function for varying @xmath41 and @xmath42 while holding @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 constant . as in the @xmath77 case ,",
    "the objective function rapidly oscillates .",
    "although substituting @xmath86 for @xmath8 reduces these oscillations as before ( fig .",
    "[ fig : objective_funs](e ) ) , substituting @xmath87 for @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : objective_funs](f ) ) produces an erroneous result : the minimum of the function shifts from @xmath88 mm to @xmath89 mm .",
    "while this shift is less than a beam waist , lateral resolution is the most important criterion for imaging at these relatively large wavelengths .",
    "since @xmath90 provides the smoothest objective and accurately locates the single scatterer , @xmath8 is represented by @xmath90 for the @xmath77 case .",
    "however , since the scatterers can not be reliably located in simulation for the @xmath45 case if @xmath8 is represented by @xmath90 , @xmath8 is instead represented by @xmath91 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results presented here were for specific cases , showing resolution enhancement and reduction in the number of lateral measurements for synthetic aperture sensing .",
    "although it is difficult to generalize these findings , rules of thumb from compressed sensing and the observations made here can at least provide some intuition .",
    "compressed sensing theory is largely based on rip which states that all measurements should give equal information about the scene ( @xmath70 measure approximately the same amount of energy ) . for this to be true , the measurements must be widely distributed across the scene . in the optimal hopping window case",
    "this is indeed true .",
    "the farther away the volume of interest is from the focus , the wider the green parallelogram of fig .",
    "[ fig : optimal_geometry ] will be .",
    "this will allow for greater speedups in acquisition , but it comes at the cost of reduced snrs . in turn , the ability to super - resolve the points will be degraded since small variations in the phase will be less distinguishable .",
    "widening the window of estimation also allows for more compressed estimation of the object locations .",
    "however , in this case there is a finite probability of observing no energy , so rip is violated .",
    "our work shows that with good snr this is acceptable to some extent ; however , a system designer should be aware that expanding the window too far could lead to bad estimates .",
    "exactly how far is too far largely depends on snr and the number of points needed to be estimated simultaneously .",
    "ascertaining these dependencies on the salient variables in this more generic problem will be addressed in a subsequent project .",
    "it has been shown that incorrectly specifying the number of scatterers to be located does not prevent the algorithm from correctly locating all the scatterers in the field for the over - specified case or the specified number of scatterers in the under - specified case . however , it would be preferable to select the number of scatterers to be located adaptively .",
    "this is a well - known problem related to the relevance vector machine @xcite which has been related to compressed sensing and adaptive sensing by @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of this strategy is that the parameter space is as large as the inherent dimension of the estimation space , thus requiring inversions of large matrices in each step .",
    "furthermore , the grid must once again be fixed for adaptive selection of the scene sparsity , removing the ability to have the resolution of the estimate be determined by the quality of the measurement system .",
    "perhaps the resolution of the grid could first be determined by an adaptive measurement scheme , such as the one presented here , so that the grid can be accurately specified for the relevance vector machine strategy .",
    "the remaining assumptions are that the beam s spatial distribution m(x , k ) is gaussian and may be demodulated by referencing the wavevector to the minimum frequency used ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the case of a non - gaussian spatial profile is easily addressed by changing m(x , k ) to reflect the beam s actual spatial profile , assuming this is known accurately . in this case , the algorithm should still identify the correct locations of the scatterer(s ) , even if the strongest signals occur when the scatterer is not in the center of the beam .",
    "by contrast , the demodulation correction was not made ab initio but in response to the quality of the convergence in the fits .",
    "it is likely that different scenarios will require different versions of this demodulation , but the approach used here will work for most non - dispersive scatterers since their behaviors are similar at base band as at the operational frequencies .",
    "the correction of the beam gain by eq .",
    "was in response to the experimental data recognizing that phase may not be altered and appropriately compensating the amplitude to match the antenna performance .",
    "similar corrections may be required for other antenna structures .",
    "perhaps the most challenging assumptions involve the scatterers themselves ; namely , that their scattering cross sections do not depend sensitively on angle , frequency , or polarization , and that the embedding medium scatters much more weakly by comparison . by using vertically oriented , sub - wavelength diameter wires as scatterers in two dimensions ( x and z ) and performing one - dimensional lateral scans , the dependence of scattering on angle and frequency in the measurement plane",
    "is removed , as is the polarization dependence because the source polarization was aligned with the wires . generalizing our findings to the case of a three dimensional array of sparse , oriented , non - spherical scatterers",
    ", we see that all three effects may vary significantly as the aspect of the scatterer changes over the course of the two dimensional scan .",
    "these effects can be minimized by ensuring that the wavelength is significantly larger than the size of the scatterers and that circular polarization is used instead of linear .",
    "such scatterers even more strongly demand a well conditioned gaussian beam to simplify the analysis .",
    "nevertheless , this work has shown that compressive sampling techniques are practical and may become increasingly indispensable for mmw and thz imaging applications , especially when used to locate or render scenes dominated by a few sparsely - arranged scatterers .",
