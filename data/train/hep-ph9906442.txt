    "the multiparticle spectra of secondaries produced in high energy collision processes are the most abundant sources of our knowledge of the dynamics of such processes . among others , two features emerging from the analysis of these spectra",
    "are of particular interest : @xmath0 the so called intermittent behaviour observed in many experiments in the analysis of factorial moments of spectra of produced secondaries and @xmath1 the bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) observed between identical particles . whereas the former seems to indicate the existence of some ( multi ) fractal structure of the production process @xcite the latter are established as , by now the most important source of our knowledge on the space - time aspects of the multiparticle production processes @xcite . + some time ago it was argued @xcite that , in order to make both effects compatible with each other , the emitting source should fluctuate in size in a scale - invariant ( i.e. , power - like ) way . this can be achieved in two ways : @xmath0 either the shape of the interaction region is regular but its size fluctuates from event to event according to some power - like scaling law @xmath1 or the interaction region itself is a self - similar fractal extending over a very large volume @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we would like to investigate in more detail to what extent the bec is sensitive to the possible space - time fractality of the emission source .",
    "to this end we shall use a simple self - similar cascade process @xcite in which the final particles are produced in the sequential two - body decays of some original mass @xmath2 . for our purpose we shall extend it by introducing the simple ( classical ) space - time development of the cascade and by adding the kind of bec `` afterburner '' along the lines advocated recently in @xcite .",
    "+ it is widely expected that every cascade model has automatically built in the intermittent behaviour of spectra of observed particles @xcite . although this statement is true and obvious for the models based on random multiplicative processes in some chosen observed variables ( like energy , rapidity or azimuthal angle ) it is highly non trivial in the case of cascades ( or multiplicative processes ) proceeding in variable(s ) not directly mesurable but nevertheless of great dynamical importance ( as , for example , masses of some intermediate objects occuring during the production process @xcite ) . in the purely mathematical case , where cascade process proceeds _ ad infinitum _",
    ", one eventually arrives at some space - time fractal picture of the production process .",
    "however , both the finite masses of produced secondaries and limited energy ( or mass @xmath2 ) stored in the emitting source prevent the full and distinct development of such a fractal structure @xcite",
    ". one must therefore be satisfied with only some limited and mostly indirect presence or signals of such structure .",
    "if established it would , however , be important for our knowledge of the dynamics of the multiparticle production process .",
    "+ such a fractal structure in phase - space can generate a similar structure in the space - time picture of the hadronization process .",
    "our aim here is to demonstrate to what extent they influence bec . in the next two sections",
    "we shall then provide , respectively , the phase - space and space - time characteristics of a simple cascade model used for that purpose . section 4 contains our main results showing the bec features emerging from our model .",
    "section 4 contains a summary of our results and conclusions .",
    "we shall model the emitting source of mass @xmath2 by the usual @xmath3 ) random cascade process employed already in @xcite , @xmath4 , in which the initial mass @xmath2 `` decays '' into two masses @xmath5 in such a way that @xmath6 , i.e. , a part of @xmath2 equal to @xmath7 is transformed to kinetic energies of the decay products @xmath8 .",
    "the process repeats itself ( see fig .",
    "1 ) until @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the mass of the produced particles ) with successive branchings occurring sequentially and independently from each other , and with different values of @xmath11 at each branching , but with energy - momentum conservation imposed at each step . for different choices of dimensionality @xmath12 of our cascade process ( provided by the restrictions for the possible directions of flights of the decay products in each vertex )",
    "be it @xmath13 or @xmath14 dimensional ( isotropic ) and for different choices of the decay parameters @xmath11 at each vertex , we are essentially covering an enormously vast variety of different possible production schemes ranging from the essentially one - dimensional strings to thermal - like fireballs .",
    "+ of special interest is the case of a one - dimensional cascade for which one can provide analytic formulae for the rapidities @xmath15 of the decay product at each vertex given in the rest frame of the parent mass in this vertex .",

    "are equal and the same for all vertices , @xmath17 . in this case",
    "the finally produced particles occur only at the very end of the cascade process and the amount of energy allocated to the production is maximal . because the number of possible branchings characterizing the length of the cascade is equal to @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 ) , the multiplicity of produced secondaries is given by the following formula : @xmath20 according to @xcite the exponent @xmath21 is formaly nothing but a generalized ( fractal ) dimension of the fractal structure of phase space formed by our cascade .",
    "the utility of such notion is , however , greatly reduced because of the necessary limited length of our cascades @xcite .",
    "notice a kind of scaling in ( [ eq : nsym ] ) where , for a fixed ratio @xmath22 the observed multiplicity @xmath23 depends solely on the decay parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the characteristic power - like behaviour of @xmath25 in ( [ eq : nsym ] ) is normally atributed to thermal models .",
    "for example , for @xmath26 one has @xmath27 , which in thermal models would correspond to the ideal gas equation of state with velocity of sound @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the same behaviour ( on average ) is obtained for @xmath11 chosen randomly from a triangle distribution @xmath29 with @xmath30 which will be therefore used in all our numerical calculations . the fact that @xmath31 means that decay parameters are limited to @xmath32 .",
    "+ for maximally asymmetric cascades @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , at each step one has always a single final particle of transverse mass @xmath10 produced against some recoil mass @xmath35 : @xmath36 .",
    "the amount of kinetic energy allocated to the produced secondaries is now maximal .",
    "the corresponding rapidities @xmath37 and @xmath38 are now given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : yy ] ) with , respectively , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . also here",
    "the resultant multiplicity @xmath41 is given by the length @xmath42 of the cascade , which is limited by the condition @xmath43 .",
    "it means therefore that @xmath44 and the corresponding multiplicity is @xmath45 the energy dependence of @xmath46 is now logarithmic ( in thermal models it would correspond to a one dimensional fireball with @xmath47 @xcite ) but the same kind of scaling as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsym ] ) is present also here .",
    "+ our simple model therefore covers all possible energy dependencies of the multiplicities of produced particles which depend solely on decay parameters @xmath11 of the cascade and scale in the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "this remains true for both one and three dimensional cascades .",
    "+ in fig . 2",
    "one can see examples of rapidity distributions @xmath48 calculated for symmetric and asymmetric @xmath13 cascades discussed above .",
    "they are compared there with most probable distributions in one - dimension obtained by means of information theory arguments @xcite @xmath49 \\label{eq : info},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 ( what defines @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 is the corresponding lagrange multiplier ensuring proper conservation of energy - momentum in the case when @xmath53 particles , each of transverse mass @xmath10 , are produced from the source of mass @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to the case of production via the cascade process , nothing is now said about the production mechanism .",
    "it is just tacidly assumed that all produced particles occur , in a sense , instantenously in the whole allowed phase space with the weights provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : info ] ) , which was obtained by the maximalization of the suitably defined information entropy corresponding to the production process under consideration @xcite .",
    "it occurs that for a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath53 the quantity @xmath54 is ( almost ) constant as a function of energy per particle @xmath55 , i.e. , also here one encounters a kind of scaling , namely that @xmath56 . + the shape of the multiplicity distribution , @xmath57 , in our case of a source with fixed ratio @xmath22 is given by distribution @xmath58 of decay parameters @xmath11 .",
    "we shall use a simple triangle form for it ( as already mentioned above ) @xmath29 , which for @xmath30 provides the commonly accepted energy behaviour of the mean multiplicities @xmath59 as discussed above .",
    "the example of @xmath57 for @xmath13 cascades are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath57 for @xmath14 cascades are the same ) .",
    "they exemplify three different choices of the ratio @xmath22 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ) .",
    "4 , we show the behaviour of scaled ( `` horizontal '' @xcite ) factorial moments @xmath62 ( for @xmath63 ) calculated for a one - dimensional cascade in rapidity space as a function of number of bins @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is taken as the corresponding rapidity range for the corresponding mass @xmath2 and @xmath66 denotes the bin size considered ) : @xmath67 the @xmath53 produced particles are distributed among @xmath68 bins with @xmath69 particles in the @xmath70 bin , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "the average is over all events .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results , although obtained for essentially the same type of cascade as discussed in @xcite , apparently demonstrate much stronger intermittency signal than the experimental one shown there .",
    "however , no fit to the data was attempted in our case as we are concerned with the properties of a single elementary source only ( leaving the problem of their distribution in mass @xmath72 aside ) . on the other hand ,",
    "moments @xmath62 in @xcite were in reality not calculated but deduced from experimental data by means of some simple formula obtained from general ( mathematical ) fractal analysis of symmetric cascade processes .",
    "the aim was to deduce from them the fractal dimensions @xmath73 of cascade process considered .",
    "as a result the corresponding decay parameter in @xcite turns out to be very large , @xmath74 , leading to @xmath75 instead of expected @xmath76 as discussed above @xcite .",
    "we shall now endow our cascade in phase - space with space - time elements ( not addressed in @xcite ) .",
    "to this aim we introduce some fictitious finite `` life time '' @xmath77 for each vertex mass @xmath78 , which is allowed to fluctuate according to some prescribed distribution law @xmath79 .",
    "this procedure is a purely classical one , i.e. , we are not treating @xmath78 as resonances , as was done , for example , in @xcite on another occasion .",
    "instead , they are regarded to be real particles with masses given by the corresponding values of decay parameters @xmath11 and with the respective velocities equal to @xmath80 ( @xmath81 are the energy - momenta of the corresponding decay product given in the rest frame of the parent mass in each vertex ) . the energy - momentum and charges are strictly conserved in each vertex separately ( this is another difference with the information theory approach @xcite where such conservation laws are imposed on the whole process instead ) . as for a decay / branching law we shall choose it in the simplest possible exponential form : @xmath82 }                 \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ]    it is straightforward to get our cascade model in the form of a monte carlo code .",
    "the main features of a one - dimensional case has already been demonstrated above .",
    "the only difference between one and three - dimensional cascades is in the fact that , whereas in the former decay products can flow only along one , chosen direction , in the latter in each vertex the flow direction is chosen randomly from the isotropic angular distribution . to allow for some nonzero transverse momentum in the one - dimensional case we are using the transverse mass @xmath83 gev .",
    "for the three - dimensional cascade @xmath10 is instead set simply to the pion mass , @xmath84 gev . in every case",
    "all decays are described in the rest frame of the corresponding parent mass in a given vertex . to get the final distributions",
    ", one has to perform a number of lorentz transformations to the rest frame of the initial source mass @xmath2 . as output",
    "we are getting in each run ( event ) a number @xmath85 of secondaries of mass @xmath10 with both defined energy - momenta @xmath86_{i=1 , \\dots , n_j}$ ] and space - time coordinates @xmath87_{i=1 , \\dots , n_j}$ ] of the last branching ( i.e. , the coordinates of birth of each particle ) .",
    "5 shows densities @xmath88 of points of production for all cases investigated here : for @xmath13 and @xmath89 dimensional cascades with both constant and mass dependent evolution parameter @xmath90 and for three choices of the source mass , @xmath91 and @xmath92 gev .",
    "as one can see the widely expected ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) power - like behaviour of cascading source @xmath93 is seen only ( if at all ) for @xmath94 , i.e. , for radii larger then some ( not sharply defined ) radius @xmath95 , value of which depends on all parameters present here : mass @xmath2 of the source , dimensionality @xmath12 and evolution parameter @xmath90 of the cascade . below @xmath95",
    "the @xmath88 is considerably bended , remaining even almost flat for @xmath13 cascades . only for rapidly developing cascades ( i.e. , for @xmath96 ) in @xmath14 dimensions , the expected scaling sets in almost from the very beginning and it practically does not depend on the mass of the source .",
    "for the limiting case of @xmath97 gev the corresponding values of parameter @xmath98 vary from @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 for one dimensional cascades to @xmath103 and @xmath104 for three dimensional cascades .",
    "+ the shapes of @xmath88 scale in the ratio @xmath105 in the same way as the multiplicity distributions @xmath57 discussed before . as desidered power - like behaviour @xcite-@xcite sets in ( at least approximately ) only for long cascades ( large values of @xmath106 ) and/or for fast ones ( small values of @xmath90 )",
    ", it remains therefore to be checked whether ( and to what extent ) such conditions are indeed met in the usual hadronic processes .",
    "this point is , however , outside of the scope of the present work .",
    "let us proceed now to our main point , namely to the question of whether one can see in bec some special features which could be attributed solely to the the branchings and to their space - time and momentum space structure . at first glance , the answer seems to be plainly negative as it is easy to check that the function @xmath107 does not show any structure of bec type .",
    "it is also true if we endow our cascade process with the production of charges of the type : @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . in this case",
    "@xmath111 calculated for like charge pairs also does not show any correlations .",
    "that is , however , to be expected , because the only way to have ( [ eq : c2 ] ) showing `` primordial '' bec is to introduce them from the very beginning , for example in the way done recently in @xcite . using the same information theory approach as in @xcite but adding a new piece of information , namely that the produced particles are mostly bosons and as such they should be grouped together as much as possible in the phase space cells , the authors of @xcite indeed obtained a substantial bec signal , namely @xmath112 for @xmath113 in ( [ eq : c2 ] ) .",
    "no space - time structure was discussed in @xcite , however . + we can not follow this prescription here without invoking a kind of extremely difficult to formulate ( or calculate ) special final state interactions between produced secondaries .",
    "our cascade is supposed to mimic the production process in its development , whereas the information theory procedure of @xcite makes no statements whatsoever about the development of the proces as such .",
    "it only provides the least biased and at the same time most probable distributions , limited only by imposed constraints of the energy - momentum and ( mean ) number of particles conservation ( reflection of which are the two lagrange multipliers , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , representing in terminology of the usual thermal models the `` inverse temperature '' and `` chemical potential '' , respectively .",
    "we could , in principle , use the pseudopotential method as , for example , advocated long ago in @xcite , but this causes changes in the particle distributions and/or destroys the energy - momentum balance which has to be later restored in a more or less _ ad hoc _ way and it does not use the information on the space - time structure of our results .",
    "+ an open question is the possible existence of phase factors in every branch point , which would endow each particular branch and through it also the finally produced secondaries with some specific , possibly path dependent phases .",
    "this question is , however , left open here and it is understood that they are all set equal to unity",
    ". they would be important to bec correlations influencing especially values of @xmath116 , i.e. , the so called degree of coherence / chaoticity @xmath117 .",
    "we shall return to this problem elsewhere .",
    "+ because our aim is not data fitting but checking if , and to what extent , the bec via its @xmath111 observable is sensitive to different choices of the cascade processes provided by different sets of parameters , we have decided to use the ideas of the bec `` afterburners '' advocated recently in @xcite . and because we are not so much interested in particular values of the `` radius '' and `` coherence '' parameters @xmath118 and @xmath117 , but in the systematics emerging from our study , we shall use for this exploratory research the most primitive , classical version of such `` afterburner '' .",
    "the procedure we use is therefore very simple . after generating a set of @xmath119 particles for the @xmath120 event",
    "we choose all pairs of the same sign and endow them with the weight factors of the form @xmath121 \\label{eq : c}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 and @xmath123 for a given particle .",
    "+ the results obtained from @xmath124 events are presented in fig .",
    "they are displayed for the same sequence of parameters @xmath2 ( mass of the source ) , @xmath12 ( its dimensionality ) and @xmath90 ( the evolution parameter ) as in fig .",
    "5 . the characteristic feature to be noted is a substantial difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 dimensional cascades both in the widths of the @xmath125 and their shapes . whereas the former are more exponential - like the latter are more gaussian - like with a noticeably tendence to flattening out at very small values of @xmath126 .",
    "also values of intercepts , @xmath116 , are noticeable lower for @xmath14 cascades .",
    "there is also a difference between `` slow '' ( constant @xmath90 ) and `` fast '' ( @xmath127 ) cascades , especially for @xmath13 ones .",
    "the former lead to substantially different shapes in this case . in @xmath14",
    "this effect is not so visible , although it is also present .",
    "the length of the cascade ( i.e. , the radius of the production region , cf .",
    "discussion of density @xmath128 before ) dictates the width of @xmath125 .",
    "however , the @xmath129 scaling observed before in multiplicity distributions and in shapes of source functions is lost here .",
    "this is because @xmath111 depends on the differences of the momenta @xmath130 , which do not scale in @xmath22 .",
    "the flattening mentioned above together with @xmath131 for @xmath14 cascades are the most distinctive signature of the fractal structure combined with @xmath14 dimensionality of the cascade .",
    "the correlations of the position - momentum type existing here as in all flow phenomena are , in the case of @xmath14 cascades , not necessarily vanishing for very small differences in positions or momenta between particles under consideration .",
    "the reason is that our space - time structure of the process can have in @xmath14 a kind of `` holes '' , i.e. , regions in which the number of produced particles is very small .",
    "this is perhaps the most characteristic observation for fractal ( i.e. , cascade ) processes of the type considered here . +",
    "in this work we have addressed the problem of the possible space - time fractal structure of the hadronic production process .",
    "it is complementary to the possible ( multi ) fractality leading to fluctuations in the multiparticle distributions and to the possible fractality claimed to exist already on the level of hadronic structure @xcite .",
    "although there is a vast literature concerning the possible ( multi)fractality in momentum space @xcite its space - time aspects are not yet fully recognized with @xcite-@xcite remaining so far the only representative investigations in this field .",
    "our aim was to extent this investigation a bit further by essentially repeating ideas proposed in @xcite-@xcite in a numerical form that allowed us to check in more detail the conjectures made there , showing the limits of their applicability .",
    "+ our simple model posseses all features called for in @xcite - @xcite : it shows both intermittency in the phase space ( demonstrated in the limiting case of one - dimensional cascade explicitely in fig .",
    "4 ) and ( approximate ) power law distribution of the production points in the space - time ( cf . fig . 5 ) .",
    "as we have more constraints on the phase space behaviour imposed by the , for example , expected energy dependence of the multiplicity @xmath132 , we have not much freedom in choosing decay parameters @xmath24 .",
    "our distribution @xmath133 is surely not the only possible one .",
    "however , whatever shape we choose for @xmath133 it should reproduce the expected energy dependence of multiplicity , @xmath134 .",
    "therefore the only really free parameters in our study were the time evolution parameter @xmath90 and dimensionality of the cascade , @xmath12 . here",
    "only two extreme values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 were studied and two also , in a sense , extreme behaviours of @xmath135 and @xmath127 were used .",
    "all three : @xmath136 and @xmath90 were found to influence the @xmath125 observable characterising bec , cf .",
    "+ we therefore conclude that bec are , indeed , substantially influenced by the fact that our process is of the cascade type as was anticipated in @xcite-@xcite , although probably not to the extent expected there ( which , however , has not been quantified there ) .",
    "however , in practical applications , i.e. , in the eventual fitting of experimental data , there are many points which need further clarification .",
    "the most important is the fact that data are usually collected for a range of masses @xmath2 and among directly produced particles are also resonances .",
    "therefore , one has first to specify the form of the distribution @xmath72 which will influence to some extent our results . in particular changes in @xmath10 due to the production from resonances",
    "will shorten our cascade considerably .",
    "the possible effect can be to some extent deduced from our results by comparing data with @xmath97 gev with those with @xmath137 gev and @xmath138 gev .",
    "the bec will be effective only in conjunction with precise studies of distributions in the phase - space ( like @xmath72 , intermittency and momentum and rapidity distributions .",
    "these studies should to some extent fix the distribution of decay parameters @xmath139 . only then one can fit data to different parameters @xmath90 characterizing the space - time structure of the source .",
    "+ one should realize at this point that there were already attempts to study the bec with power - like ( lorenzian type ) shape of source function : @xmath140 which leads to @xmath141 ( with @xmath142 and @xmath126 defined as in our case ) @xcite .",
    "such a form is nearest to our @xmath88 and , as it turns out , gives the best fit ( in terms of the @xmath143-values ) to data considered in @xcite .",
    "however , differences between this fit and other more conventional ones ( i.e. , based on gaussian or exponential shapes of the source ) were not dramatic .",
    "this means , that in reality it will be very difficult to establish by means of bec the possible existence of fractal structure of the emitting source .",
    "perhaps the event - by - event analysis of data with some preselection of the initial conditions ( in terms of energy , centrality , multiplicity etc . ) will be necessary in order to perform such investigations .",
    "+ our approach must be regarded as preliminary because of our choice of treatment of bec . notwithstanding its obvious deficiencies ( already mentioned in @xcite )",
    "it seems , however , fully adequate for the present study which is , as mentioned above , of only limited scope .",
    "however , even in such form it seems to indicate the relevance of the fact of a possible fractal structure of the space - time of the emitting region preventing particles from different branches to be in the same emitting cell irrespectively of the smallness of differences in their positions or momenta .",
