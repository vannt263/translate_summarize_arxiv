    "particle laden flows and their numerical simulation are of interest in a wide range of engineering applications as well as in fundamental research .",
    "a frequently used approach for the simulation of dynamic granular materials is the discrete element method ( dem ) , cf .",
    "@xcite . the linear and angular momentum balance of the particles",
    "is solved to obtain translational and rotational velocity . the hydrodynamic interaction between particles",
    "is often neglected or fluid forces are accounted for by simple empirical correlations and the particle interaction modelled using macroscopic collision models .",
    "the accurate numerical modelling of the collision process is crucial for the quality of the simulation in a vast regime of parameters .",
    "several numerical models for the collision process between particles and for the collision of particles with walls have been developed in the framework of the dem @xcite .",
    "these models can be divided into two groups : hard - sphere models and soft - sphere models .",
    "the hard sphere approach quasi - instantaneous .",
    "the post - collisional velocities are calculated from momentum conservation between the states before and after surface contact .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for details .",
    "soft - sphere models usually require an excessively small time step if physically realistic material parameters are matched . in the soft - sphere approach the motion of the particles",
    "is calculated by numerically integrating the equations of motion of the particles accounting for the contact forces acting on them .",
    "typical for all soft - sphere models is that very small time steps must be used to ensure that for reasons of stability and accuracy the step size in time is substantially smaller than the duration of contact .",
    "the soft - sphere contact forces are usually based on linear and non - linear spring damper models , reviews of which may be found in @xcite a commonly used model for time - resolved particle interactions in numerical simulations is a hertzian contact force in combination with a linear damping @xcite . however , in contrast to linear spring models , no closed solution exists for this equation .",
    "one is hence forced to integrate numerically with a very small time step .",
    "this issue even leads some researchers to prefer linear spring models which are much easier to evaluate @xcite .",
    "the discussion whether the linear or the non - linear approach is to be preferred seems unsettled in the community so far @xcite , and the present paper does not aim to compare these or to advocate one or the other . instead",
    ", the mathematical properties of the equation of damped hertzian contact are discussed and an efficient engineering approximation is proposed so as to reduce the cost of this model .",
    "this can enhance the efficiency of dems employing the physically more realistic non - linear approach .",
    "due to the time - step reduction required by many soft - sphere models , dem practitioners modify the material parameters of the collision model to this problem @xcite and allow the use of larger time steps .",
    "the idea is to make the collision process softer hence longer in time , at the price of increased numerical overlap of particles during collisions . except for the linear models ,",
    "the adjustment of parameters in the soft - sphere model is usually performed by trail and error . this is time consuming and prone to a sub - optimal choice of values . a current trend in the modelling of particulate flows",
    "is that dems are enhanced by representations of the viscous effects of the continuous phase around the particles , cf .",
    "@xcite . in this framework ,",
    "hard - sphere models are inapplicable as they can not properly account for the coupling to the surrounding viscous fluid , thus introducing substantial numerical errors @xcite . here ,",
    "soft - sphere models are required , with the drawbacks discussed above . as a remedy , a systematic strategy was recently proposed to determine the parameters for a softened contact model @xcite .",
    "it is based on imposing the duration of the contact between the particles during collisions according to some external constraint , such as a pre - selected time step .",
    "the coefficients in the model are then determined so as to maintain the exact restitution coefficient .",
    "this guarantees maximal physical realism under given constraints imposed by computational resources .",
    "the approach , termed adaptive collision time model ( actm ) , was implemented and tested with particles in viscous fluids for single collisions @xcite as well as for multiple simultaneous collisions @xcite .    beyond that",
    ", the approach is very interesting for pure dem without viscous fluid , as it provides an automated systematic approach to regularizing the collision process .",
    "another substantial advantage of this approach is that the original physical values of the coefficients can be introduced as bounds so that the original model is obtained again in a regular limit when the collision time is sufficiently reduced .",
    "this provides optimal commodity for the user .    in a simulation with many particles ,",
    "each collision takes place with different velocities of the collision partners .",
    "hence , when imposing duration of contact an restitution coefficient , one is forced to select the model coefficients for stiffness and damping for each collision individually .",
    "if no closed solution is available , this requires an iterative procedure as indeed used so far @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", this is now improved by providing a direct solution to this problem , based on a systematically controlled approximation .",
    "the increased efficiency is demonstrated by suitable test cases and comparison to the original method .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , an exact formal solution of the equation of motion for a normal linarly damped hertzian collision is derived using nonlinear transformations and a parametric series expansion .",
    "then , a rigorous calculation of the collision time and restitution coefficient is carried out . , compact analytical approximations are developed formul allow the direct computation of the physically relevant parameters collision time and restitution coefficient from the intrinsic material parameters .",
    "afterwards , the inverse problem is addressed .",
    "the artificial lengthening of the collision time while preserving the restitution coefficient requires the computation of the appropriate stiffness and damping .",
    "finally , numerical tests demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm , including test runs in typical engineering settings .",
    "particle deformation during contact is represented here by the overlap of the undeformed particle with the collision partner .",
    "the equation of motion governing the surface penetration @xmath0 during the contact phase @xmath1 with @xmath2 the mass of the particle and @xmath3 .",
    "the overdot represents differentiation with respect to time @xmath4 .",
    "the second term is the nonlinear restoring force originally derived by @xcite .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of corresponds to the damping , which is assumed to be .",
    "the initial conditions at the beginning of the collision are @xmath5 .",
    "equation is more conveniently expressed in dimensionless form by defining new variables @xmath6 with @xmath7 , which is tantamount to fixing the characteristic unit of velocity for the system as @xmath8 and choosing the ( at present arbitrary ) unit of time .",
    "the first and second derivatives of @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath10 and @xmath11    following @xcite , the collision time @xmath12 @xmath13 is obtained as the strictly positive root of @xmath9 , i.e. the point of time when the surface penetration of the particle - wall system returns to zero .",
    "the restitution coefficient is then conveniently defined as @xmath14 the latter expression makes clear that the only way the restitution coefficient may depend on material and other input parameters is as a function of the parameter @xmath15 introduced above .",
    "physically , one may interpret this as follows : all linearly damped normal hertzian particle - wall collisions are , up to a characteristic parameter , similar .",
    "this characteristic parameter can be the restitution coefficient @xmath16 , which is easy to determine experimentally but can not be calculated trivially from known material properties and initial conditions .",
    "the other option , introduced here , is , which can not be measured directly but is readily calculated . at the heart of the present work",
    "is the convenient analytical conversion between the two .",
    "the case @xmath17 corresponds to the undamped case considered by @xcite , which is simply a conservative system , i.e. @xmath18 , and is integrated readily .",
    "furthermore , @xcite gave the collision time as @xmath19{\\frac{25m_{\\rm_p}^2}{16k^2u_{\\rm in}}}\\:,\\ ] ] with @xmath20 denoting the gamma function .",
    "yields @xmath21 in dimensionless form .",
    "the purpose of this section is to calculate rigorously from first principles , i.e. starting from the equation of motion and using mathematically justifiable techniques , the physical parameters pertaining to the characterization of collisions in the chosen model .",
    "such results are not only useful for the purpose of theoretical investigation , but are also instructive from the perspective of the analytical technique . since are , to the best of our knowledge , not available in the existing literature , in the following .    due to the fractional power of @xmath22 in and the initial condition @xmath23 ,",
    "a naive power series solution for @xmath22 in @xmath24 is not possible .",
    "furthermore , it is not desirable at all to have a series representation in @xmath4 , since it is not a variable that is naturally small .",
    "on the other hand , especially in practical applications , very low values of @xmath16 are unlikely to be of interest . by consequence",
    ", @xmath15 is a parameter that may be assumed small for practical purposes . indeed , numerical examples show that if a lower bound of @xmath25 on @xmath16 , @xmath26 may be safely assumed .",
    "thus , in the following , the solution of the equation of motion is expressed using series in @xmath15 .",
    "it will be found that the relevant mathematical operations are facilitated when the problem is transformed to phase space @xmath27 , the dimensionless velocity can be interpreted as a function of the penetration , i.e. @xmath28 . using the relation @xmath29 the equation of motion expressed in these new variables reads @xmath30 in passing , observe that if the damping term were absent , this would reduce to an exact differential , with the solution given by the level curve of a potential function which readily interpret as the conserved total energy of the system .",
    "energy method was by @xcite when the undamped case .",
    "the analysis here , however , needs to be more involved .",
    "@xmath31 where ` in ' refers to the part of the collision during which the particle is compressed and the motion is directed into the wall , while ` out ' describes the outward motion of the particle ( figure [ fig : zt_ph ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath32 , whence @xmath33 . inserting these new variables into the initial value problems @xmath34 for @xmath15 assumed small , : @xmath35 differentiating @xmath36 times with respect to @xmath15 and evaluating at @xmath17 successively yields the equations determining @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 , this gives @xmath40 the higher order corrections are given by @xmath41 since the @xmath42-st derivative of @xmath43 at @xmath17 can only involve @xmath44 , equations and yield well - defined recursions for @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , it is readily seen by mathematical induction , that @xmath37 have a convergent taylor series expansion around @xmath45 , and that the convergence radius is @xmath46 . from conservation of energy",
    "however , it can be deduced that @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath37 can be represented by a power series on the whole domain of interest .",
    "a physical interpretation of these terms is discussed in [ app : physint ] .",
    "note also that derivatives of @xmath16 appear explicitly in the expressions for @xmath48 .",
    "this does not imply that @xmath16 needs to be known _ a priori_. rather , it will be seen later that @xmath16 is uniquely determined by certain conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for the trajectory to be continuous in time and space .    to find a connection to the time domain",
    ", one may exploit the fact that @xmath49 to find @xmath50 with @xmath51 the maximum surface penetration .",
    "this solves the problem in the classical sense . in order to obtain an explicit relation of the form @xmath52",
    ", one would have to take the functional inverse and square the resultant expression .",
    "however , since it does not contribute to the calculation of the relevant physical properties @xmath53 and @xmath13 , that part of the problem , though utterly non - trivial , will not be addressed .      with the above solution  of the equation of motion at hand",
    ", it is now possible to calculate the significant physical quantities .",
    "although the two primary parameters of interest are the restitution coefficient @xmath16 and collision time @xmath13 , the calculation of the maximum penetration @xmath54 is required as an intermediate step . from the definition of @xmath55 , it follows that @xmath56 , the more tractable condition @xmath57 with @xmath51 the maximum penetration .",
    "this equation uniquely determines @xmath54 the smallest positive real root of @xmath58 .",
    "since the solution trajectory is required to be continuous , the velocity on both the inward and outward trajectory must go to zero at the same value @xmath59 ielding the condition @xmath60 this uniquely determines @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the collision time can be computed directly as @xmath61    obviously , each of the above quantities depend on @xmath15 . for @xmath17 , the classical case of the undamped hertzian restoring force",
    "is obtained , for which the solutions are @xcite @xmath62 for @xmath15 small , therefore , it is natural to develop the solutions in terms of a power series in @xmath15 around @xmath63 , whereby the respective governing equations are successively differentiated at @xmath17 using implicit differentiation , with the chain rule used to evaluate the taylor coefficients .

    "this reduces the number of parameters in the equation to a single constant @xmath15 depending on the material parameters @xmath146 and the impact velocity @xmath8 . in particular , the physically relevant and practically interesting properties , the collision time @xmath107 ( dimensionless : @xmath13 ) and restitution coefficient @xmath16 , hence ,",
    "only depend on this particular combination of physical input parameters .",
    "this is conceptually and technically analogous to the damping ratio , or its inverse , the quality factor , which are familiar from the simple harmonic oscillator , the latter more so from @xmath147 circuits in electrical engineering but appears to be new in the present setting of damped hertzian collisions . in contrast , earlier works @xcite typically use a three - parameter family of input variables @xmath148 . while the use of @xmath16 to label cases is helpful in practice , the proposed nondimensionalisation and the subsequent analytical investigation establishes in a straightforward manner the one - to - one correspondence between the important experimental parameter @xmath16 and the parameter @xmath15 , which is easy to obtain from material parameters .",
    "furthermore , it demonstrates that different parameters with the same @xmath16 have solutions that are identical up to a linear scaling of space and time .",
    "next , an exact formal solution of the governing equation using nonlinear transformations and a series in the parameter @xmath15 was proposed , a rigorous calculation of @xmath16 and @xmath13 from the equation of motion . owing to the technical difficulties presented by the governing equation ,",
    "the analysis is necessarily involved , the methods and technique employed may be instructive , the results may be of use in theoretical considerations .",
    "the approach is also quite flexible , and a similar analysis would be applicable to more general settings , such as the extension to fully nonlinear models , i.e. nonlinear spring force in combination with a nonlinear dissipative force some studies @xcite",
    ". this may be the subject of future investigation .",
    "subsequently , compact and convenient formul for @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "inverse formul were derived on that basis , enabling a very efficient and accurate calculation of the required stiffness and damping from the given input parameters , i.e. the desired collision time @xmath107 and restitution coefficient @xmath16 .",
    "these were then applied to engineering context .",
    "the scheme in the actm replaced by the direct approximate solution developed here .",
    "numerical tests on binary and multiple particle collisions confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method .",
    "the computations in section  [ sec : num - test ] were performed at zih , tu dresden .",
    "the authors thank prof .",
    "dr . ralph chill and prof .",
    "jrgen voigt for helpful discussions on an early status of this work .",
    "the first author wishes to express his gratitude to the martin - andersen - nex - gymnasium dresden for providing the appropriate framework within its school curriculum to carry out parts of the research .",
    "t may be instructive to the physical meaning of the coefficients @xmath37 in the series expansion in powers of @xmath15 of @xmath43 , equations .",
    "first , it is readily seen that @xmath149 as obtained in .",
    "the fact that the two expressions are equal indicates reversibility .",
    "indeed , for @xmath17 , the classical oscillation problem with hertzian restoring force is obtained , which is a conservative system . moreover , upon inspection of the functional dependence , it is evident that the zeroth - order term expresses conservation of mechanical energy itself .",
    "he kinetic energy per unit mass and in dimensionless form is given by @xmath150 depending on which part of the trajectory is considered .",
    "thus , the auxiliary variables @xmath43 are proportional to the kinetic energy . the potential energy associated with the hertz contact force ( dimensionless and per unit mass ) is @xmath151 for both the inward and outward motion of the particle , the conservation of energy @xmath152 is valid to zeroth - order in @xmath15 .    ow consider the more involved first - order corrections .",
    " @xmath153 both integrals can be evaluated analytically to give @xmath154 with @xmath155 denoting the hypergeometric function ( cf .",
    "* chapter 15 , pp .",
    "555 ) . a similar expression results for @xmath156 .",
    "the integral representations are actually more conducive for physical interpretation .",
    "indeed , both expressions can be interpreted as work done by the dissipative force . in case of @xmath156",
    ", there is an added constant term , because the initial condition @xmath157 depends on @xmath15 , unlike the much more straightforward case @xmath158 .",
    "for this reason , the + , or inward , branch of the trajectory in the following . since @xmath159 , @xmath160 on the other hand , from @xmath161",
    ", it follows that to first order in @xmath15 , the work done by the damping force is @xmath162 thus , @xmath163 are essentially first - order corrections in the energy balance due to the work done by the dissipative term in the equations of motion .",
