    "currents may be efficiently generated in a plasma by the injection of rf waves whose phase velocities are several times the electron thermal speed @xcite .",
    "the efficiency , defined as the ratio of current generated to power dissipated , is achieved in this instance because the rf - generated plateau decays at a rate given by the collision frequency for the fast electrons , which is relatively low . in the quest for higher efficiencies , current drive by waves which interact with relativistic electrons has also been considered @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects modify the scaling of the efficiency , placing an upper bound on the efficiency achievable by current drive by fast waves . in this paper , we do several things : we give a more complete analysis of this problem based on a formalism adopted by antonsen and chu @xcite .",
    "specifically , we find that the effect of finite electron temperature leads to an enhancement of the efficiency . in order to calculate this effect ,",
    "we first give expressions for the most important terms in the electron - electron collision integral in the relativistic limit .",
    "these expressions are put in rosenbluth form so as to be amenable to easy implementation on a computer .",
    "we imagine that the relativistic rosenbluth potentials that we identify may be useful in other problems arising in very hot plamas .    in order to put the present work in perspective ,",
    "let us briefly review the chief tools used in the study of current drive .",
    "the early work used fairly crude analytical models @xcite .",
    "these models were sufficient to obtain the scaling laws for the efficiency of current drive , but were unable to provide the coefficients with any accuracy . therefore , the analytical treatment was supplemented by numerical solutions to the two - dimensional ( in momentum space ) fokker ",
    "planck equation , from which accurate estimates of the efficiency could be found .",
    "the first accurate analytical treatment of current drive was based on a langevin formulation of the electron motion @xcite .",
    "this involved taking the electron temperature to be small , allowing energy scattering to be ignored .",
    "the moment hierarchy for the langevin equations can then be closed , which allows an analytical solution to be obtained .",
    "this was followed by a more complete numerical study of the fokker ",
    "planck equation for current drive in which the problem was reduced to the numerical solution of a one - dimensional integro - differential equation with a source due to the rf @xcite . in this",
    "work toroidal effects were also included .",
    "the results agreed with the langevin analysis @xcite in the limit of large phase velocities ( as they should ) and gave more accurate numerical data for phase velocities comparable to or smaller than the thermal velocity .",
    "more recently , antonsen and chu @xcite and , independently , taguchi @xcite , using methods first used in the study of beam - driven currents @xcite , recognized that it is not necessary to solve the rf - driven fokker ",
    "planck equation in order to find the rf - induced current .",
    "instead , they showed that the green s function for the current is the spitzer ",
    "hrm function @xcite describing the perturbed electron distribution in the presence of an electric field .",
    "this reduces the problem to the determination of a single two - dimensional function , from which the current generated by any form of rf drive can be calculated by a simple integration .    up until now",
    ", the only reliable analytical results for current drive in a relativistic plasma are those obtained using the langevin methods by ref .  .",
    "as we will show , these are only exact for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the momentum of the resonant electrons ) .",
    "a more complete analytical or numerical treatment along the lines of that achieved in the nonrelativistic case was hampered by the lack of a convenient form for the relativistic collision operator .",
    "this is remedied to some extent by the results of this paper where we calculate the collision integrals for the first legendre harmonic of the perturbed electron distribution neglecting electromagnetic effects on the binary interaction ( in this approximation the collision integral reduces to the landau form ) .",
    "having done this , we are able to generalize the treatment of antonsen and chu @xcite to the relativistic case .",
    "a number of useful results flow from this : we can numerically calculate to high precision the current - drive efficiencies in the relativistic regime .",
    "we can perform an asymptotic analysis of the spitzer  hrm problem to obtain analytic approximations to the efficiencies .",
    "in addition , we give higher - order asymptotic corrections to the current - drive efficiencies in the nonrelativistic limit . throughout this paper , toroidal effects are entirely ignored .",
    "although these effects are important in the study of current drive by low - phase - velocity waves , they play little role in current drive by fast waves .",
    "incorporation of these effects , however , proceeds in exact analogy with the treatment for the nonrelativistic case @xcite .",
    "relativistic effects on rf current drive have also been considered by hizanidis and bers @xcite .",
    "they take moments of the kinetic equation . in order to close the resulting system of equations , they approximate the steady - state electron distribution by a delta function .",
    "this approximation is unjustified and , consequently , their results for the current - drive efficiency are incorrect .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in sec .",

    "for example , if low - phase - velocity waves interact through a cyclotron resonance with fast electrons , the rf flux may be nearly parallel to the constant energy contours , at the same time that the collisionality of the resonant electrons is small .",
    "this gives very high efficiency , but , in practice , these waves are much more difficult to generate than are lower - hybrid waves .",
    "settling the question of the highest attainable current - drive efficiency with fast waves should enable , we hope , tokamak reactor designers to assess the practicality of using waves to drive steady - state currents .",
    "there may , of course , be other effects that present difficulties , such as the accessibility of the waves or nonlinear effects .",
    "on the other hand , there may be effects , such as the bootstrap current , which could be helpful .",
    "finally , we hope that the form that we derived here for the relativistic collision operator , which enabled us to solve for the relativistic spitzer  hrm function , will be of use in other numerical problems dealing with collisions in hot plasmas .",
