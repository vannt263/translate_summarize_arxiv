    "confinement of fluids in nanoscopic capillaries is a problem that has received longstanding attention .",
    "an interesting interplay occurs between surface effects at the confining walls , such as wetting or drying @xcite , and finite size effects due to the finite capillary width .",
    "this interplay leads to a host of intriguing phenomena , such as capillary condensation or evaporation @xcite , and a crossover in critical behavior from three - dimensional ( 3d ) to two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising character @xcite . apart from fundamental theoretical importance , understanding the structure and phase behavior of confined fluids is also a prerequisite for targeted applications in microfluidic and nanofluidic devices , which are becoming increasingly more relevant @xcite .",
    "however , for fluids consisting of small molecules , complications such as the atomistic corrugation of the confining walls @xcite , impurity atoms at the walls , roughness of the walls due to surface steps , dislocations in the crystal structure , and so forth , may have a profound effect on the phenomena mentioned above .",
    "this is especially true when the width of the slit pore is of the order of a few nanometers , in which case a quantitative understanding becomes difficult . in this respect ,",
    "colloidal dispersions , containing colloidal particles with diameters in the micrometer range , possess certain advantages .",
    "it then becomes possible to prepare slit pores which are only a few particle diameters wide , and yet have walls that are essentially flat on the size scale of the particles .",
    "in addition , interactions between colloidal particles can be well tuned @xcite .",
    "particularly promising systems of this kind are colloid  polymer mixtures , since both the bulk phase behavior , and the interfaces separating the colloid  rich and polymer  rich phases , can be studied experimentally in detail @xcite . moreover , the asakura ",
    "oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite provides a simple theoretical framework , which seems to capture the essential features of such phase  separating systems , and is moreover well suited for computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to provide precise predictions for the phase diagram and the structure of the ao model confined between structureless hard walls .",
    "we consider film thicknesses ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 colloid diameters .",
    "our work complements earlier work @xcite , based on gibbs ensemble monte carlo , which focused on the non - critical regime of the phase diagram . in this work ,",
    "also the critical regime is considered , in order to compare to theoretical predictions for the shift in critical parameters as function of the film thickness @xcite .",
    "we consider a colloid - to - polymer size ratio @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the colloid diameter and @xmath8 the polymer diameter of gyration , since for this particular size ratio , accurate information on the bulk and interfacial properties is available @xcite .",
    "we also explore the effect of an additional weak repulsion between the walls and the colloids ( in addition to the hard interaction already present ) . understanding the combined effect of film thickness and wall - colloid interaction , is crucial in providing guidance for the interpretation of possible experiments . at this point , we are aware of only one experiment on capillary condensation of a colloid  polymer mixture ( in a wedge formed by glass plates @xcite ) , but we hope that the present study will encourage further experiments . in related previous work carried out by us , in which a film thickness @xmath9 and purely hard walls were considered , the crossover from 3d to 2d ising critical behavior was already discussed @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we summarize the most important theoretical predictions relevant for the interpretation of our results . in sec .",
    "iii , the ao model is introduced , and details on the simulation technique are provided . in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the phase behavior and the structural properties of the ao model as the film thickness @xmath1 is varied , while sec .",
    "v considers the influence of the colloid ",
    "wall interaction . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we consider a system with an one - component order parameter near its critical point .",
    "examples of such systems are fluids near their vapor - liquid critical point , magnetic systems ( such as the simple ising model ) , and binary mixtures ( such as colloid - polymer mixtures ) near their critical point of unmixing .",
    "as is well known , all these systems in 3d bulk belong to the 3d  ising universality class @xcite .",
    "in particular , critical exponents such as the exponent @xmath10 ( which characterizes the growth of the order parameter correlation length @xmath11 near the critical point ) , or the order parameter exponent @xmath12 ( which characterizes the shape of the binodal between the unmixed phases in a binary mixture ) have nontrivial values @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xcite , rather than the classical mean  field values @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "when these systems are confined between two identical flat planar structureless walls a distance @xmath1 apart , two distinct physical phenomena affecting the phase transition are expected to occur :    1 .",
    "the growth of the critical correlations in the direction perpendicular to the walls is limited by the finite thickness of the film , while critical correlations can still grow further and unlimited in the two directions parallel to the film .",
    "therefore , a crossover from 3d  critical behavior toward 2d  critical behavior ( for which the exponents mentioned above take the values @xmath17 and @xmath18 , assuming 2d  ising universality @xcite ) is expected .",
    "this crossover is predicted to occur when the temperature - like variable has approached a relative distance @xmath19 from the critical point in the bulk such that @xmath20 is of the same order as @xmath1 , implying a crossover distance of order @xmath21 .",
    "this dimensional crossover in critical behavior also implies an additional enhancement of fluctuations ( in lower dimensionality stronger fluctuations occur ) .",
    "this leads to a depression of the critical point .",
    "consequently , one expects a shift of the critical point of the same order , @xmath22 .",
    "2 .   if there is no special symmetry between the coexisting phases , one must expect that there is an ( energetic and/or entropic ) preference of the walls for one of the coexisting phases in comparison to the other .",
    "this phenomenon is also well known to occur away from the critical point .",
    "for example , hydrophilic walls of a thin slit capillary are known to lead to `` capillary condensation '' of an undersaturated vapor in the capillary @xcite . of course , for hydrophobic rather than hydrophilic walls ,",
    "also the opposite effect ( `` capillary evaporation '' ) may occur .",
    "clearly , a quantitative prediction of the magnitude , and sometimes even the sign , of these effects , requires detailed knowledge of the forces between the walls and the particles confined by them .",
    "however , since phase equilibrium is always shifted due to surface corrections to the relevant thermodynamic potentials , we expect a shift in the coexistence chemical potential in the thin film , relative to its value in the bulk , of order @xmath3 .",
    "this is the so - called `` kelvin equation '' @xcite , which is expected to be valid away from the critical point .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding shift in the chemical potential at criticality is more subtle .",
    "this becomes most transparent for the case of an ising magnet ( or , equivalently , the lattice gas model ) , where in the bulk there is a symmetry between the coexisting `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' phases .",
    "however , in the thin film , this symmetry may be broken by a surface magnetic field @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "while phase coexistence in the bulk occurs for bulk magnetic field @xmath24 , coexistence in the thin film now requires a nonzero bulk field ( with a sign opposite to that of the surface field @xmath23 ) .",
    "it has been shown that in the presence of the surface field , the singular part of the free energy per spin in this ising model should scale as @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 @xcite the critical exponent of the specific heat , @xmath27 @xcite the so - called `` gap exponent '' which characterizes the bulk equation of state , and @xmath28 @xcite its surface analogue .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath29 , where the signs refer to the sign of @xmath19 , are discussed in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we only infer from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) that the shift in the critical temperature should read as @xcite @xmath30/t_{\\rm c}(\\infty ) \\nonumber \\\\    & = & -d^{-1/\\nu } x_{\\rm c}(h_1d^{\\delta _ 1/\\nu } ) , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and similarly for the shift in the bulk magnetic field required to establish coexistence again @xmath31 here , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are again scaling functions , and @xmath34 denotes the critical temperature in the bulk ( @xmath2 ) system .",
    "note that for small @xmath23 , we expect that @xmath32 tends to a constant , while @xmath33 becomes a linear function of its argument .",
    "this limit is relevant in the present case , since we deal with rather small film thicknesses @xmath1 .",
    "considering now mixtures of colloids ( c ) and polymers ( p ) in the grand ",
    "canonical ensemble , chemical potentials , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , of colloids and polymers , respectively , as well as temperature @xmath37 and system volume @xmath38 become the relevant independent thermodynamic variables . in the framework of the ao model @xcite , the dependence on temperature only enters via the fugacities @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "there is no other explicit temperature dependence in this model .",
    "considering the fugacity of the polymers as a temperature  like variable , bulk phase coexistence between a phase rich in colloids ( analogous to a liquid in the liquid - vapor transition ) with colloid packing fraction @xmath41 , and a phase poor in colloids ( analogous to the vapor ) with colloid packing fraction @xmath42 , occurs on the line @xmath43 .",
    "the latter is determined by the equation @xmath44 in the plane of variables ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath46 thus plays a role analogous to that of the magnetic field @xmath47 in the ising model , and @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath49 for @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the spontaneous magnetization or order - parameter .",
    "while in the ising model there is a symmetry with respect to the sign of @xmath47 , no corresponding symmetry with respect to the sign of @xmath52 occurs in colloid ",
    "polymer mixtures , of course . in the ising model ,",
    "the two branches @xmath53 of the binodal , corresponding to positive and negative fields , are equivalent ; this is the particle  hole symmetry of the lattice gas .",
    "obviously , no such symmetry exists in _ asymmetric _ mixtures .",
    "therefore , the above identification of variables holds only to a first approximation , and for a more precise discussion of critical phenomena one needs to consider `` field mixing '' effects @xcite .",
    "the temperature  like variable @xmath19 should then be taken parallel to the curve @xmath54 at the point @xmath55 , and the field  like variable @xmath47 becomes a suitable linear combination of the variables @xmath52 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "even more intricate becomes the identification of the variable corresponding to @xmath23 , the local magnetic field coupling to the spins at the surface of the ising magnet .",
    "the case @xmath57 physically means `` neutral walls '' , in which case the walls prefer neither the `` spin - up''-phase nor the `` spin - down''-phase of the ferromagnet .",
    "it is not at all obvious which choice of surface interactions would correspond to such a `` neutral wall '' , preferring neither the colloid - rich phase , nor the polymer - rich phase of our model . of course",
    ", a completely analogous difficulty occurs in studies of capillary condensation and/or surface critical phenomena associated with the vapor ",
    "liquid critical point of ordinary fluids @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , in general , whatever the choice for the strength and range of the particle  wall interaction , it will likely correspond to a situation @xmath58 , but we have no possibility to predict the strength ( and even the sign ) of @xmath23 beforehand . in principle , a careful analysis of order parameter profiles at the bulk critical point of a very `` thick '' film ( which approximates a semi ",
    "infinite system with two surfaces ) for various wall  particle interactions could provide insight into how to realize a situation with @xmath57 at criticality @xcite .",
    "this , however , gives no guarantee that , for the same choice of interactions , one also has @xmath57 outside of the critical region .    on the other hand ,",
    "if our simulations display only very small shifts of @xmath59 with decreasing film thickness , one may assume that @xmath23 in our model is indeed small .",
    "in this case , eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) still hold .",
    "however , if the data indicate that this is not the case , and rather the inverse limit @xmath60 is reached instead , simple power laws would again result @xmath61 while the first power law of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is the same as before ( only the constant of proportionality has changed ) , the second power law clearly implies a somewhat faster decay than found in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath62 a crossover behavior should be detectable , but to clearly identify such behavior may be difficult . in any case",
    ", the above discussion already shows that ( confined ) colloid  polymer mixtures may give rise to a much more complex behavior than the simple ising model @xcite , and hence their study should be rewarding .",
    "in this work , the colloids are modeled as hard spheres with diameter @xmath7 , while the polymers are described as spheres with diameter @xmath8 .",
    "the polymers may not overlap with colloids , but there is no interaction between the polymers .",
    "the choice of this model @xcite is motivated by the fact that flexible polymers form random coils with a rather large gyration radius @xmath63 , which may interpenetrate at very low energy cost ( in particular if the solution in which the polymers are dissolved , and the colloidal particles are suspended , is close to theta  point conditions @xcite ) .",
    "colloids , on the other hand , can be prepared with interactions of very short range @xcite .",
    "we specialize to a size ratio @xmath64 in the following and choose @xmath65 as our unit of length .",
    "the polymer and colloid packing fractions are @xmath66 and @xmath67 , when we have @xmath68 polymers and @xmath69 colloids in our system of volume @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we choose a volume in the geometry of a rectangular box of linear dimensions @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath73 and @xmath74directions . in the remaining @xmath75direction ,",
    "we place two @xmath76 walls , at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , which act as hard walls for both polymers and colloids , while in addition a repulsive step potential of height @xmath79 ( in units of @xmath80 ) acts on the colloids .",
    "the full colloid - wall interaction @xmath81 thus reads as : @xmath82 with @xmath83 the distance from the _ surface _ of the colloid to the wall . in this work ,",
    "@xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are considered .",
    "note that the case @xmath84 ( purely hard walls for both colloids and polymers ) and @xmath9 has already been investigated in our previous work @xcite . in this case , a very strong attraction between the colloids and the walls develops due to the depletion effect @xcite .    following common practice @xcite , we choose the so - called ( dimensionless ) `` polymer reservoir packing fraction '' @xmath89 , rather than the polymer fugacity @xmath90 , as the temperature - like variable . as in our previous work @xcite",

    "the precise location of the fugacity @xmath94 at which two  phase coexistence occurs is obtained using the equal  weight rule @xcite .",

    "it is clear that , despite the repulsive colloid - wall energy ( @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cw ] ) ) , the entropically driven attraction of the colloids to the walls still exists , and causes the formation of a rather dense layer of colloids at the walls . at not too large values of @xmath120 , one can even see an indication of a second layer of colloids in the `` vapor '' phase . of course , in the liquid phase , rather pronounced layering effects can always be detected .",
    "for the case @xmath5 , there are three colloidal layers adjacent to each wall ; in the range @xmath180 , the density profiles are essentially horizontal .",

    "[ fig8 ] . ]    in view of the high colloid density reached locally in the first layer adjacent to each wall , one may wonder whether this affects the lateral ordering of the colloids in planes parallel to the walls .",

    "we have determined @xmath186 in the bulk region of the film ( center ) , and in the vicinity of the walls , i.e.  at a distance of @xmath192 from the walls .",
    "note that , in a system with walls ( or virtual boundaries that define , e.g. , the center of the confined system ) , the definition of the radial distibution function is different from that in the bulk . in an isotropic system with periodic boundary conditions",

    "[ fig13 ] , that variations in @xmath79 significantly influence the radial distribution functions , @xmath183 and @xmath199 , measured at the walls . by increasing @xmath79 ,",
    "a reduction of the first peak in @xmath183 occurs , with the second peak becoming almost completely washed out ; for @xmath184 the effect is even more dramatic .",
    "as expected , increasing @xmath79 reduces the colloid density at the walls somewhat , thereby also weakening their tendency to order in the layers adjacent to the walls .",
    "similar conclusions emerge from other wall thicknesses , too , and are therefore not shown here .",
    "colloid  polymer mixtures are important model systems for the experimental exploration of fluid  fluid phase separation @xcite and interfacial phenomena @xcite . in order to guide possible future experiments on phase separation of such systems in confined geometry ,",
    "we have carried out a simulation study of a generic model system , the ao model , confined to a slit formed by two parallel walls .",
    "the walls were not only impenetrable to both colloids and polymers , but in addition a short  ranged repulsive interaction between the walls and the colloids was added .",
    "such an interaction can be realized , for instance , by a suitable coating of the walls with a moderately dense polymer brush ( with the same chemical composition of the polymers dissolved in the solution ) . in this way",
    ", the strength of the depletion interaction between the colloid and the walls can be modified .",
    "our results show that the unmixing binodal , describing phase separation in colloid  polymer mixtures , changes dramatically from its bulk form , when the width of the pore is in the range of 310 colloid diameters .",
    "while such ultra  thin pores seem to be experimentally realizable for colloidal systems , where the particle diameters are in the micrometer range , a corresponding study of a mixture of small molecules or atoms , clearly , would be extremely difficult , if not impossible .",
    "surprisingly , even for thin pores , we find that bulk  like phase behavior in the center of the pore is obtained , provided one is far away from criticality . only for pores with thicknesses smaller than @xmath200 or so , can a bulk  like region in the center of the pore no longer be identified . in this case , the layering induced in the density by the left wall interferes with the layering due to the right wall .",
    "therefore , such extremely thin slit pores can not be accounted for quantitatively in terms of a decomposition of their properties into bulk and surface properties .",
    "hence , the description of the shift of the transition between the phases poor in colloids ( `` vapor '' ) and rich in colloids ( `` liquid '' ) in terms of the kelvin equation , no longer is accurate .",
    "nevertheless , agreement with the kelvin equation is already recovered again above @xmath201 or so , which is still remarkably thin .",
    "the main emphasis of this work , however , has been a study of the shift of the critical point .",
    "it has been shown that the scaling theory of fisher and nakanishi @xcite , originally formulated for the ising lattice gas model exhibiting full particle  hole symmetry between the coexisting phases , is compatible with our present numerical results .",
    "a nontrivial finding , which needs further investigation , is the fact that the critical value of the coexistence diameter approaches its limiting value in a non - monotonic way when @xmath202 .    in our study ,",
    "we have obtained not only accurate binodal curves of confined colloid  polymer mixtures , but we have also characterized the coexisting colloid ",
    "rich and colloid ",
    "poor phases in terms of their concentration profiles across the slit pore , and in terms of their radial distribution functions obtained in planes parallel to the walls .",
    "it would be interesting to extract corresponding information from experiments . since the ao model is a crude simplification of reality , characteristic differences between simulation and experiment are to be expected , elucidating the limitations of the ao model .    in future work",
    ", we plan to extend our study to confinement between two parallel planar walls which are nonequivalent , whereby , for example , only one wall is coated by the polymer brush . in this way , an experimental realization of the interface localization ",
    "delocalization transition @xcite may become possible .",
    "also an extension of such studies to the dynamics of phase separation under confinement is of interest .",
    "we hope that the present work will stimulate corresponding experimental efforts .",
