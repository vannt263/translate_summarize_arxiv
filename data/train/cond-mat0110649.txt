    "as usual , random matrix ensembles are constructed by selecting classes of matrices with specified properties under discrete symmetries @xcite . to define these ensembles we have to specify ( i ) what are the discrete symmetries , ( ii ) what are the equivalence relations among the matrices , and ( iii ) what are the probablility measures for each class .",
    "\\(i ) + let @xmath0 denote a complex matrix .",
    "we demand that the transformations specifying random matrix classes are involutions  their actions are of order two .",
    "so we consider the following set of symmetries : & : & h = _ c c h^t c^-1,c^tc^-1= [ csym ] + p  sym.&:&h = - p h p^-1 , p^2=*1 * [ psym ] + q  sym.&:&h = q h^ q^-1 , q^q^-1=*1 * [ qsym ] + k  sym.&:&h = k h^ * k^-1 , kk^*= [ ksym ] @xmath1 denotes the transposed matrix of @xmath0 , @xmath2 its complex conjugate and @xmath3 its hermitian conjugate .",
    "the factor @xmath4 is just a sign @xmath5 .",
    "we could have introduced similar signs in the definitions of type @xmath6 and type @xmath7 symmetries ; however they can be removed by redefining @xmath8 .",
    "we also demand that these transformations are implemented by _",
    "unitary _ transformations : cc^=*1 * ,  pp^=*1 * ,   qq^=*1 * ,  kk^=*1 *    in the case of hermitian matrices one refers to type @xmath9 symmetries as particle / hole symmetries or time reversal symmetries depending on whether @xmath10 or @xmath11 respectively .",
    "matrices with type @xmath12 symmetry are said to be chiral .",
    "both type @xmath6 and type @xmath7 symmetries impose reality conditions on @xmath0 and they are redundant for hermitian matrices .",
    "\\(ii ) + we consider matrices up to _ unitary _ changes of basis , huhu^ [ equiv ] in other words , matrices linked by unitary similarity transformations are said to be gauge equivalent . for the symmetries ( [ csym][ksym ] ) , this gauge equivalence translates into : cucu^t ,  pupu^-1 ,  ququ^ ,  kuku^*-1 [ symgauge ]    the classification relies heavily on this rule and on the assumed unitary implementations of the discrete symmetries .",
    "we shall only classify minimal classes , which by definition are those whose matrices do not commute with a fixed matrix .",
    "\\(iii ) + since each of the classes we shall describe below is a subset of the space of complex matrices , the simplest probability measure @xmath13 one may choose is obtained by restriction of the gaussian one defined by ( dh ) = n ( - trhh^ ) dh [ gauss ] with @xmath14 a normalization factor .",
    "it is invariant under the map ( [ equiv ] ) .",
    "there is of course some degree of arbitrariness in formulating these rules , in particular concerning the choice of the gauge equivalence ( [ equiv ] ) .",
    "it however originates on one hand by requiring the gaussian measure ( [ gauss ] ) be invariant , and one the another hand from considering auxiliary hermitian matrices @xmath15 obtained by doubling the vector spaces on which the matrices @xmath0 are acting .",
    "these doubled matrices are defined by : = [ double ] they are always chiral as they anticommute with @xmath16 .",
    "any similarity transformations @xmath17 are mapped into @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "so , demanding that these transformations also act by similarity on @xmath20 imposes @xmath21 to be unitary .",
    "on @xmath20 , both type @xmath12 and @xmath6 symmetries act as chiral transformations , @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and @xmath20 may be block diagonalized if @xmath0 is @xmath6 or @xmath12 symmetric . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath0 is @xmath6 symmetric then @xmath26 and @xmath20 may be simultaneously diagonalized since they commute .",
    "if @xmath0 is @xmath12 symmetric , @xmath20 commutes with the product @xmath27 .",
    "type @xmath9 and @xmath7 symmetries both act as particle / hole symmetries relating @xmath20 to its transpose @xmath28 .",
    "the classification of the doubled hamiltonians @xmath20 thus reduces to that of chiral random matrices , cf .",
    ". however , the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath20 may differ significantly so that we need a finer classification involving @xmath0 per se .",
    "to specify classes we demand that the matrices belonging to a given class be invariant under one or more of the symmetries ( [ csym][ksym ] ) .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that when imposing two or more symmetries it is the group generated by these symmetries which is meaningful .",
    "indeed , these groups may be presented in various ways depending on which generators one picks .",
    "for instance , if a matrix possesses both a type @xmath12 and a type @xmath9 symmetry , then it automatically has another type @xmath9 symmetry with @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the intrinsic classification concerns the classification of the symmetry groups generated by the transformations ( [ csym][ksym ] ) .",
    "we demand , as usual , that the transformations ( [ csym][ksym ] ) commute . for any pair of symmetries",
    "the commutativity conditions read : c = pcp^t & ; p^*=k^-1pk & ; q = pqp^[com1 ] + q^t = c^q^-1c & ; q^*=k^-1qk^-1 & ; k^tc^-1kc^*= the signs @xmath31 are arbitrary ; they shall correspond to different groups .",
    "this arises if no type @xmath12 and type @xmath6 symmetry is imposed so that no reality condition is specified and @xmath0 is simply a complex matrix .",
    "we may then impose either a type @xmath12 or a type @xmath9 symmetry or both .",
    "not all groups generated by a type @xmath12 and a type @xmath9 symmetry are distinct since , as mentioned above , the product of these symmetries is another type @xmath9 symmetry but with an opposite sign @xmath4 .",
    "the list of inequivalent symmetry groups , together with the inequivalent choices of the sign @xmath4 , is the following :    ccc generators & discrete symmetry group & number + & defining relations & of classes +   + no sym & no condition & 1 + @xmath12 sym & @xmath32 & 1 + @xmath9 sym & @xmath33 & 4 + @xmath12 , @xmath9 sym & @xmath34 & 2 + @xmath12 , @xmath9 sym & @xmath35 & 2 +  &   +    if the sign @xmath4 does not appear as an entry it means that the value of this sign is irrelevent  opposite values correspond to identical groups .",
    "the sign factors @xmath31 written explicitly are relevant  meaning that e.g. the groups generated by a type @xmath9 symmetry with @xmath36 or @xmath37 are inequivalent .",
    "the equivalences among the defining relations for groups generated a type @xmath12 and a type @xmath9 symmetry are the following :    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     considering groups generated by more symmetries does not lead to new minimal classes since in such cases one may construct matrices commuting with @xmath0 .",
    "having determined the inequivalent groups of commuting discrete symmetries , the second step consists in finding all inequivalent representations of the defining relations of those groups . due to the rules we choose , in particular the second one , eq.([equiv ] )",
    ", we only consider representations in which all symmetries are unitarily implemented and which are not unitarily equivalent .        if we impose only a type @xmath12 symmetry .",
    "the matrix @xmath38 is unitary and square to the identity , so that it is diagonalizable with eigenvalues @xmath39 .",
    "the solution @xmath40 is trivial as it implies @xmath41 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the numbers of @xmath42 and @xmath43 eigenvalues are equal , we may choose a basis diagonalizing @xmath38 : ( p = _ z1 ) ; [ p1 ] here and below , @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the standard pauli matrices .    if we only impose a type @xmath9 symmetry",
    ", @xmath46 is unitary and either symmetric and antisymmetric .",
    "as is well known @xcite , up to an appropriate gauge choice it may be presented into one of the following forms : ( c = 1)__c;(c = i_y1)__c ; [ c1 ]    let us now impose a type @xmath12 and a type @xmath9 symmetry . in the basis diagonalizing @xmath38 with @xmath47 ,",
    "the commutativity relation @xmath48 means that either @xmath38 and @xmath46 commute or anticommute .",
    "if they commute , then @xmath46 is block diagonal in this basis so that @xmath49 or @xmath50 depending whether it is symmetric or antisymmetric .",
    "if they anticommute , @xmath46 is block off - diagonal so that , modulo unitary change of basis , it may be reduced to @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "however , as explained in the previous intrinsic classification , these two cases correspond the same symmetry group but with opposite signs @xmath4 .",
    "so a set of inequivalent representations is : & & ( p=_z1 ,  c=11 ) ; ( p=_z11 ,  c=1i_y1 ) ; + & &   ( p=_z1 ,  c=_x1)__c ; [ pc1 ] altogether there are @xmath53 classes of non - hermitian random matrices without reality conditions .",
    "they are of course parallel to the @xmath53 classes of hermitian random matrices @xcite .    imposing only a type @xmath6 symmetry",
    ", we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 since , by choice , we implement the symmetry unitarily .",
    "so @xmath56 is diagonalizable with eigenvalues @xmath39 .",
    "the solution @xmath57 is non - trivial as it simply means that @xmath0 is hermitian . when @xmath56 possesses both @xmath42 and @xmath43 eigenvalues we assume that they are in equal numbers , hence : ( q=1);(q=_z1 ) ; [ q1 ]      when imposing both type @xmath12 and @xmath6 symmetries , @xmath38 and @xmath56 both square to the identity and either commute and anticommute .",
    "in the gauge in which @xmath60 the possible @xmath56 are @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 , up to unitary similarity transformations preserving the form of @xmath38 .",
    "however , the two first possibilities generate identical groups , thus the inequivalent representations are : ( p=_z1 ,  q=11);(p=_z1 ,  q=_x1 ) ;    let us next impose a type @xmath12 and a type @xmath7 symmetry . with the unitarity property of @xmath38 and @xmath64 ,",
    "the commutativity relations between these symmetries are similar to those between type @xmath12 and @xmath9 symmetries .",
    "thus , the classification of these representations may be borrowed from eq.([pc1 ] ) and we have : & & ( p=_z1 ,  k=11 ) ; ( p=_z11 ,  k=1i_y1 ) ; + & &   ( p=_z1 ,  k=_x1 ) ; [ pk1 ]    when imposing simultaneously a type @xmath6 and a type @xmath9 symmetry , their product is a symmetry of type @xmath7 .",
    "the commutativity constraints between type @xmath6 and @xmath9 symmetries are solved in the same way as the commutativity conditions for type @xmath12 and @xmath9 symmetries ; the only difference being that @xmath57 is now a non - trivial solution , contrary to @xmath40 .",
    "the inequivalent representations for @xmath56 and @xmath46 are : ( q=1 ,  c=1)__c & ; & ( q=11 ,  c = i_y1)__c ; [ qc1 ] + ( q=_z1 ,  c=11)__c & ; & ( q=_z1 ,  c=1i_y)__c + ( q = _",
    "z1 ,  c = i_y1)__c & ; & ( q=_z1 ,  c=_x1)__c ;    finally , let us impose a type @xmath12 symmetry together with two among the three types of symmetries @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 .",
    "the commutativity constraints are solved by first choosing a gauge in which @xmath60 .",
    "the list of inequivalent solutions is : ( p=_z1 ,  & q = 11 ,   & c=11  or  c=1i_y ) ; + ( p=_z1 ,  & q = 11 ,   & c=_x1)__c ; [ pcq1 ] + ( p=_z1 ,  & q = _",

    ".    altogether , eqs.([p1][pcq1 ] ) give @xmath65 classes of random non - hermitian matrices . as for the ginibre ensembles @xcite",
    " which correspond to the classes without symmetry or with type @xmath7 symmetry with @xmath66 or @xmath67  we expect that in the large matrix size limit the density of states in each class covers a bounded domain of the complex plane with the topology of a disc .",
