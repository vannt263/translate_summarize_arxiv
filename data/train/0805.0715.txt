    "over the last 30 years there has been an increasing interest in the critical behaviour of systems ( fluids , magnets  ) confined between two infinite parallel plates i.e. films .",
    "such systems can be regarded as @xmath0dimensional generalization of two @xmath12dimensional walls separated by matter of thickness @xmath1 . the so called thermodynamic casimir effect related to fluctuation induced long  ranged forces between the plates was , and still is , the central theme of these investigations both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this effect was first predicted by fisher and de gennes @xcite in their investigation on a confined critical binary liquid at its bulk demixing point .",
    "they showed that the reduced free energy per unit area contains a term of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the so called casimir amplitude by analogy with the casimir effect in vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field between two metallic plates @xcite .",
    "it is a universal quantity that depends on the bulk universality class and the boundary conditions @xmath15 imposed on the confining walls @xcite .",
    "the different types of boundary conditions are in turn related to distinct universality classes of surface critical behaviour depending on the behaviour of the order parameter at the surfaces bounding the system and some additional surface properties @xcite .    in general , according to and the singular part of the free  energy density of a finite ( in one or more directions ) @xmath0dimensional system with linear size @xmath1 , near the bulk critical point @xmath16 , may be expressed in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are related to the temperature , @xmath20 , and the external magnetic field , @xmath21 , via @xmath22 the arguments of @xmath23 are appropriate scaled variables , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the usual critical exponents , while all the details of the system are incorporated in the non  universal quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 . then the function @xmath23 is a universal scaling function , whose exact expression depends upon the number of finite directions , the bulk universality class and the boundary conditions @xmath15 to which the system is subjected . for a system confined to a film geometry , at @xmath28 ,",
    "the casimir amplitude coincides with the critical amplitude of the singular part of the free energy density , i.e. @xmath29    the spherical model of berlin and kac @xcite was initially designed to mimic the critical properties of the ising model .",
    "it has been obtained by requiring the spins to be continuous variables subject to a global constraint ( the sum of the squares of spins at each lattice site is equal to the total number of sites @xmath30 ) rather than a local one ( the square of the spin at each site is exactly 1 ) .",
    "later it was shown that the free energy of this model can be obtained as a limiting case of that of the heisenberg model with infinite number of spin components @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the heisenberg model with infinite spin components and the spherical model remains valid for finite systems , as long as one considers boundary conditions that preserve the translational invariance of the lattice @xcite .",
    "proposed to simplify the spherical model by requiring the global constraint of berlin and kac to be obeyed in the sense of an ensemble average .",
    "this model is generally known as the _ mean spherical model_.    because of its exact solubility the ferromagnetic mean spherical model has been extensively used to gain insights into the critical properties of finite ( in one or more directions ) systems .",
    "periodic boundary conditions , implying ferromagnetic interactions of spins belonging to both boundaries on the finite directions , have been by far the most used boundary conditions .",
    "these allow for analytic treatment of problems related to the finite  size scaling theory @xcite .",
    "in addition to periodic boundary conditions , antiperiodic boundary conditions have also been used @xcite to investigate the finite  size scaling properties of the ferromagnetic mean spherical model .",
    "the aforementioned boundary conditions do not break the translational invariance of the model in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "much less has been achieved in the case of nonperiodic ( free ) boundary conditions .",
    "these are believed to be more relevant to real systems , especially to systems confined between parallel plates .",
    "the ferromagnetic mean spherical model of finite thickness has been investigated in the case of dirichlet boundary conditions by , , , and , and neumann boundary conditions by , and . and investigated the scaling properties of the mean spherical model with a finite thickness using a method originally devised by .",
    "they obtained explicit forms of the equation for the spherical field at three , four and five dimensions , separately .",
    "the method was extended to the study of the finite  size effects in the case of neumann and neumann  dirichlet boundary conditions by .",
    "argued that the results of and for dirichlet boundary conditions were incorrect at three dimensions far from the critical point .",
    "later , the equation for the spherical field of was rederived by .",
    "it should be mentioned , however that the derivation of is based on an improved method of . on the other hand , in @xcite the free energy density for the different kinds of boundary conditions",
    "was obtained by integrating the equation for the spherical field leading to complicated integral representations .",
    "in the present paper we propose a different method to treat the finite size effects in the mean spherical model of finite thickness .",
    "the method is a generalization of that devised by for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it applies to antiperiodic , dirichlet , neumann boundary conditions imposed on both surfaces bounding the system and a combination of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on each surface .",
    "the method is quite general and is used for arbitrary dimension .",
    "furthermore , the finite  size contributions to the free energy density are obtained directly form the corresponding general expression rather than through integration of the equation for the spherical field .",
    "we anticipate here that from our results we recover the particular cases of , , and but not the results of .",
    "we will return to these points later in the paper .",
