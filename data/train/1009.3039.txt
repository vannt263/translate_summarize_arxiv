    "the torsional oscillator experiments of kim and chan@xcite , where at low temperature a drop in the moment of inertia is observed , have motivated a number of computational studies@xcite of solid @xmath1he as well as various theoretical proposals@xcite to explain the observation .",
    "there is evidence of a very strong dependence of the superfluid response on the @xmath0he impurity concentration@xcite as well as other well known facts@xcite about the role of impurities in solid @xmath1he@xcite .",
    "proposals for the possible role of @xmath0he impurities in solid @xmath1he have a long history and date back in the late sixties@xcite and seventies@xcite .",
    "in addition , there are several experimental studies of the nmr relaxation of such impurities in solid helium@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of great interest to study the role of impurities in solid @xmath1he .",
    "boninsegni et al.@xcite have carried out a path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) solid @xmath1he using the worm algorithm and found that vacancies phase separate .",
    "pollet et al.@xcite and boninsegni et al.@xcite have also used the above pimc technique to show that grain boundaries in solid @xmath1he and screw dislocations lead to superfluidity .",
    "in addition , using the same method pollet et al.@xcite have shown that the gap to create vacancies closes by applying a moderate pressure .    in the present paper , motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical activity on the possible role of the @xmath0he impurities in solid @xmath1he , we study the role of a @xmath0he impurity and of an interstitial @xmath1he atom in two - dimensional ( 2d ) and 3d solid @xmath1he using pimc simulation .",
    "in addition to the motivation generated by the previous discussed experimental activity , this problem is of interest in its own right because it is not really known what happens locally when one injects a @xmath0he atom in 2d or 3d solid @xmath1he , and this can be studied by quantum simulation .",
    "in particular , we use the worm algorithm  @xcite to simulate the 2d and 3d solid helium in the presence of such crystalline defects .",
    "we present results of the radial distribution functions and off - diagonal one - body density matrix ( obdm ) for the following cases .",
    "( a ) pure solid @xmath1he at somewhat above but near the liquid - solid melting density ( @xmath2 @xmath3 or @xmath4 @xmath5 ) .",
    "( b ) a single substitutional @xmath0he impurity in solid @xmath1he . ( c ) an interstitial @xmath1he atom ( defect ) .",
    "this atom is identical to the other @xmath1he atoms and , therefore , it participates in permutation cycles .",
    "( d ) an interstitial @xmath0he impurity in solid @xmath1he .",
    "we find that an initial interstitial impurity quickly relaxes to a regular lattice site of the @xmath1he solid by creating an interstitial @xmath1he atom as was proposed in ref .  .",
    "furthermore , we find that introducing such interstitial impurities in @xmath1he solid greatly enhances the long - distance part of the off - diagonal obdm .",
    "this enhancement as well as the calculated superfluid response is comparable to that of interstitial @xmath1he atomic defects .",
    "it is quite possible that at a finite density interstitial @xmath1he atoms phase separate as do vacancies@xcite .",
    "in such case the enhancement of the obdm at long distances and of the superfluid density , due to a single interstitial @xmath0he or @xmath1he atom found in the present paper , may disappear when a finite density of such impurities or interstitials is introduced .",
    "however , interstitial atoms or impurity atoms can bind to already existing defects , such as dislocations or disclinations ( especially in 2d ) and this tendency for phase separation may be avoided . in general , it is of great value to know what happens _ locally _ in the 2d and in the 3d crystalline @xmath1he when a @xmath0he impurity or an interstitial @xmath1he atom is introduced .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we briefly describe the pimc method used to study this system . in sec .",
    "[ distribution ] , we present and discuss the pair distribution functions for the case of a 2d and 3d solid with and without the introduction of a @xmath0he impurity and @xmath1he interstitial atom .",
    "the energetics of creating such atomic defects in the 2d and 3d solids as well as the calculation of the effective mass of @xmath0he impurity in solid @xmath1he is discussed in sec .",
    "[ energetics ] . in sec .",
    "[ superfluidity ] we present the results for the one - body density matrix , the superfluid density and a histogram of the number of particles involved in the same permutation cycle for the cases ( a - d ) above for 2d and 3d solid helium .",
    "finally , the main findings as well as the limitations of the present work are discussed in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "using an approximation for the density matrix that is accurate to fourth order  @xcite in @xmath6 , we use 320 time slices to reach a simulation temperature of @xmath7 .",
    "we have collected data from 2500 continuous iterations for our simulations in 2d , and @xmath81000 continuous iterations for our simulations in 3d .",
    "each iteration consists of 500 monte carlo moves .",
    "all simulated atoms considered in our present studies are isotopes of helium and therefore interact via the same potential .",
    "we use the aziz  @xcite potential to model both the @xmath1he-@xmath1he interaction and the @xmath0he-@xmath1he interaction . with the exception of the @xmath0he impurity atom the rest are all @xmath1he atoms which will be treated appropriately to simulate their bosonic nature .",
    "the impurity atom is distinguishable from the `` background '' @xmath1he atoms .",
    "our simulation cell is designed to accommodate either a 2d 56-site triangular lattice that is very nearly square ( @xmath9    @xmath10   ) , or a 3d 180-site hexagonal close - packed lattice ( @xmath11    @xmath12  @xmath13   ) . in both cases of the 2d and 3d lattices",
    "we have used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the density of lattice sites is fixed at @xmath14@xmath3 ( 2d ) and @xmath15@xmath5 ( 3d ) .",

    "how does the impurity atom affect the pair distribution function @xmath19 of the @xmath1he atoms of the underlying solid ?",
    "we find that when a substitutional impurity is introduced it becomes localized and occupies an ideal lattice position with its own zero - point motion determined by its different mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present the calculated @xmath16 radial distribution for pairs of @xmath1he atoms for the four different case systems studied : ( a ) pure solid @xmath1he ( dashed line ) ( b ) the @xmath1he solid with a substitutional @xmath0he impurity ( also dashed line ) ( c ) the @xmath1he solid with an interstitial @xmath1he defect ( solid line ) , and ( d ) the @xmath1he solid with an interstitial @xmath0he impurity ( also solid line ) . within the accuracy of our results we can not discern any difference in the @xmath19 distribution function for the cases of the pure solid and the substitutional impurities . when an interstitial impurity is present in the @xmath1he solid , we find that the impurity becomes localized at a substitutional position , thereby promoting the extra @xmath1he atom to the interstitial band .",
    "this is shown by the snapshot space - time configuration shown in fig .",
    "notice that while the initial configuration has an interstitial @xmath0he impurity , in the configuration obtained after thermalization ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) the @xmath0he becomes substitutional by promoting an interstitial @xmath1he atom .",
    "namely , in the equilibrium configuration , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the @xmath0he atom , in our lattice with periodic boundary conditions , is located in a regular triangular lattice position surrounded by six @xmath1he atoms .",
    "in addition , a @xmath1he atom has been promoted to the interstitial space which creates larger density fluctuations in the crystalline arrangement in some parts of the system . as a consequence of this",

    "[ fig3 ] , is less peaked at the lattice positions . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top ) the calculated pair distribution function @xmath17 for pure 2d solid @xmath1he is shown and in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( middle ) we present the contour plot of the same @xmath17 .",
    "this function is nearly identical for the substitutional solid ( which is not shown , as it looks exactly alike ) .",
    "this implies that the introduced substitutional impurity becomes localized and it only affects its neighboring atoms . in the case of an interstitial impurity",
    "the difference in the @xmath19 distribution function , as discussed above and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( bottom ) , is significant because the added impurity takes the position of a @xmath1he atom and , thus , there is an extra @xmath1he atom that necessarily becomes interstitial . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot @xmath22 , the difference between @xmath17 of the pure solid and the solid with a single interstitial impurity .",
    "notice that the extra atom is truly interstitial since the @xmath19 is reduced by an amount in the neighborhood of the ideal lattice positions and enhanced in the interstitial space by the same amount .",
    "it was verified through integration in the enhanced regions ( or the reduced regions ) finding exactly one extra @xmath1he atom in the interstitial regions .",
    "our finding that the interstitial impurity becomes localized at regular lattice sites can be further illustrated by comparing the contour plots of the @xmath17 and @xmath20 for the case where we have a @xmath1he solid with an interstitial impurity . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we present the contour plot of the distribution function @xmath17 for the case of a @xmath1he solid with an interstitial impurity . within the accuracy of the discretization of the probability density of the contour plot",
    "this function is independent of the type of defect or impurity . in the lower panel",
    "is the distribution function @xmath20 for pairs consisting of the impurity atom and one @xmath1he atom . because the contour plots for both @xmath20 and @xmath17 are identical in shape and in form",
    ", we may surmise that the impurity atoms are located at lattice sites .      in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show @xmath16 for the 3d system . as in 2d , we find that the pure solid and the substitutional solid are nearly identical in structure , as are the two interstitial solids",
    ". also shown is the difference , @xmath21 , between @xmath16 the pure solid and the interstitial solid .",
    "as expected , @xmath16 for both interstitial solids is less peaked at lattice positions compared to the pure and substitutional solids .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath1he interstitial solid really does have a @xmath1he atom in the interstitial space , and also that the interstitial @xmath0he solid has relaxed into a space where the @xmath0he interstitial atom has become substitutional , and in doing so promoted a @xmath1he atom to the interstitial band .    0.3 in",

    "red crosses represent the @xmath1he atoms at each imaginary time slice , while blue circles represent the @xmath0he impurity .",
    "the @xmath0he atom can be seen to be at a region of local disorder . ]",
    "if a @xmath0he atom , initially placed in the interstitial region of a triangular solid of @xmath1he atoms , relaxes onto a lattice site by promotion of a @xmath1he atom to the interstitial space , this should be seen in the energy values of the simulated atoms . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the potential energy of a @xmath0he atom in the substitutional and interstitial @xmath0he solids .",
    "a short relaxation time can be seen for the interstitial solid , as the @xmath0he atom relaxes onto the lattice .",
    "after that , the potential energy of a @xmath0he atom in both systems is almost the same .",
    "after 600 iterations , a small bump is seen in the energy of the ( initially ) interstitial @xmath0he atom .",
    "a snapshot of the atomic configuration at this elevated energy value is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath0he atom is no longer at an equilibrium lattice position , but rather at what appears to be a possible edge dislocation .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected , as a @xmath0he atom in solid @xmath1he exhibits a high rate of diffusion .",
    "such `` blips '' in the energy of the @xmath0he in the interstitial solid occur occasionally throughout our simulation , but account for no more than 5% of configurations .",
    ".excitation energy of an interstitial @xmath1he atom , as calculated by the difference in energy between ( 1 ) the pure solid and the interstitial @xmath1he solid , and ( 2 ) the substitutional solid and the interstitial @xmath0he solid .",

    "[ fig9 ] we compare the one - body density matrix @xmath24 for ( a ) defect - free solid @xmath1he ( solid line ) , ( b ) solid @xmath1he with a substitutional @xmath0he impurity ( dotted line ) , ( c ) solid @xmath1he with an interstitial @xmath1he defect ( long - dashed line ) , ( d ) solid @xmath1he with an interstitial @xmath0he impurity ( dashed line ) , and notice that the substitutional @xmath0he impurity and the pure solid have similar one - body density matrices .",
    "on the contrary , a @xmath1he solid with interstitial @xmath0he impurity and a @xmath1he solid with interstitial @xmath1he atoms have one - body density matrices which are significantly enhanced at long distances .",
    "this result agrees with the fact that winding numbers ( and hence superflow ) are observed in the interstitial solid ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "notice that these superfluid fractions are very high considering that the simulation was carried out at @xmath7 .",
    "the reason for these high superfluid fractions is finite size effects .",
    "these results for the superfluid fraction are presented in order to make the case that a interstitial impurity has a very similar effect on the superfluid fraction and obdm as an interstitial @xmath1he atom .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we compare the one - body density matrix for the 3d results . as in 2d ,",
    "both the pure solid and the substitutional solid show exponential decay of @xmath24 .",
    "although the enhancement of @xmath24 at large distance is not obvious for the interstitial @xmath0he solid , it is very obvious for the interstitial @xmath1he solid .",
    "this may be due to a shorter mc run as compared to the 2d data .",
    "in any case , once again both interstitial solids display superfluidity , while the pure and substitutional solids do not ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ( for 2d ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ( for 3d ) we present a histogram of cycles ( i.e. , how often in the simulation we encounter cycles of exchanges involving a given number of particles ) .",
    "notice that in both 2d and 3d case , the pure solid and the @xmath0he substitutional solid has only one or two particle permutation cycles , while when an interstitial @xmath0he or @xmath23 atom is introduced , it gives rise to permutations involving up to a 10 atom chain , which is as long as the longest possible distance in our lattice .",
    "this indicates that the result may not be a finite - size effect .",
    "one of the main conclusions of the present paper is that the added interstitial impurity in both 2d and 3d @xmath1he becomes substitutional by creating a interstitial @xmath1he defect ; we believe that this result is firm and it is not subject to finite size effects .",
    "furthermore , we find that the effective mass of a @xmath0he impurity atom in both 2d and 3d solid @xmath1he is large at @xmath25 k ( @xmath26 ) and at a lower temperature of @xmath27 mk in 2d it becomes even larger ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , we find that the above mentioned effect ( i.e. , the promotion of a @xmath1he atom to the interstitial band by the impurity ) gives rise to a non - zero superfluid response and a significant enhancement of the obdm at long - distances .",
    "this suggests that , provided that this effect persists when a finite density of @xmath0he impurities is present and , provided that such a metastable state can be created and maintained , @xmath1he solid with such impurities should be a supersolid .",
    "however , this can not be established by the present calculation done for a single impurity in a pure @xmath1he solid and it depends on a number of other factors . for example , while we have clearly demonstrated that a single @xmath0he impurity acts as a donor of @xmath1he atoms to the interstitial ( `` conduction '' ) band , the fate of these freed bosonic `` carriers '' is not certain when there is a finite density of @xmath0he impurities . in this case",
    "the created interstitial @xmath1he atoms can phase - separate in a similar way as vacancies do@xcite , or they may bind to existing defects , such as , dislocations , domain walls , or grain boundaries or even remain free .",
    "it is not clear that such interstitial defects exist in the @xmath1he solid caused by @xmath0he or other impurities .",
    "this is an issue which could depend on the process of the crystal growth@xcite .",
    "a 2d @xmath1he solid only exists as films on substrates , such as on graphite .",
    "the phase diagrams of first , second , third and fourth layer of @xmath1he on graphite , as a function coverage , has been studied by pimc simulation @xcite .",
    "the role of substrate corrugations , which is missing from the present simulation of the ideal 2d @xmath1he , is important and the interplay of these substrate potential corrugations with the helium - helium interaction gives rise to a wealth of interesting phases@xcite .",
    "it is quite possible , however , that the main conclusion of the present paper , that introducing an interstitial @xmath0he impurity is solid @xmath1he leads to the promotion of a @xmath1he atom to an interstitial position while the @xmath0he impurity becomes substitutional , may remain valid even in the case of substrate corrugations .",
    "the superfluid response which was calculated at 1 k and is given in table  [ table1 ] is very large considering the fact that the calculation was done at such a high temperature .",
    "this is a finite - size effect but at a much lower temperature the superfluid response is expected to be greater .",
    "a calculation of the superfluid density at a significantly lower temperature requires much larger computational time scales in order to be able to accurately sample it . in the 3d case ,",
    "the zero temperature condensate fraction obtained as the asymptotic value ( infinite distance value ) of the off - diagonal obdm at zero temperature , is much smaller by at least two orders of magnitude ( as seen from fig.[fig10 ] ) .",
    "therefore , as is well - known , there is a large factor relating the superfluid response and the actual condensate fraction .",
    "it is clear that introducing just a single impurity and taking the infinite volume limit ( or infinite area limit in 2d ) , the superfluid density and the condensate fraction should vanish .",
    "it is interesting , however , the fact that the ratio of the values of both these two quantities to the impurity fraction ( the impurity fraction is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the total number of @xmath1he atoms considered ) is a number of order unity .",
    "these reported results on the off - diagonal obdm and superfluid density , have only a qualitative value and one can not draw firm conclusions because of a ) finite size effects and b ) they refer to the case of a single @xmath0he impurity or single @xmath1he interstitial .",
    "this work was partially supported by a nasa grant nag3 - 2867 and the calculations were performed on the florida state university high - performance - computing cluster .",

    "<S> we have studied the role of an atomic @xmath0he impurity and an interstitial @xmath1he atom in two- and three - dimensional solid @xmath1he using path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when a substitutional @xmath0he impurity is introduced , the impurity becomes localized and occupies an ideal lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> when an interstitial @xmath0he impurity is introduced in the @xmath1he solid , we find that the impurity becomes localized at a substitutional position and , thus , promotes the extra @xmath1he atom to the interstitial space . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> we find that the one - body density matrix ( obdm ) and the superfluid fraction , for the case of a @xmath1he solid with an interstitial impurity , are very similar to those calculated for a @xmath1he solid with a @xmath1he interstitial atom . </S>",
    "<S> namely , while the off - diagonal obdm approaches zero exponentially with increasing particle displacement for the `` pure '' solid , an interstitial @xmath1he atom or a @xmath0he impurity appear to enhance it at long distances . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the effective mass of the @xmath0he impurity quasiparticle in 2d and 3d crystalline @xmath1he is estimated . </S>"
