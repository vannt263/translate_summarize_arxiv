    "we refer to our previous paper @xcite : in that paper we described the computation of the carmichael numbers up to @xmath6 and presented some statistics .",

    "we used improved versions of strategies described in @xcite .",
    "the principal search was a depth - first back - tracking search over possible sequences of primes factors @xmath8 . put @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we find that @xmath12 must satisfy the congruence @xmath13 and so in particular @xmath14 must satisfy a congruence modulo @xmath15 : further @xmath16 must be a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "we modified this to terminate the search early at some level @xmath18 if the modulus @xmath19 is large enough to limit the possible values of @xmath12 , which may then be factorised directly .",
    "we also employed the variant based on proposition 2 of @xcite which determines the finitely many possible pairs @xmath20 from @xmath21 . in practice",
    "this was useful only when @xmath22 allowing us to determine the complete list of carmichael numbers with three prime factors up to @xmath23 .",
    "the count of these is 35586 ( not 35585 as incorrectly reported in our preliminary work ) .",
    "finally we employed a different search over large values of @xmath24 , in the range @xmath25 , using the property that @xmath26 and factorising the numbers in this arithmetic progression less than @xmath27 .",
