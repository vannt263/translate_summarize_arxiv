    "in this section we will study in some more detail how the parton construction of the superfluid state manages to be compressible . as discussed in the main text ,",
    "the parton construction of the superfluid state is as follows .",
    "we rewrite the boson operator as @xmath11 where @xmath16 are fermions .",
    "next , we consider a mean - field ansatz where @xmath12 forms a band insulator with chern number @xmath55 , while @xmath13 forms a band insulator with chern number @xmath56 , and suppose that these band insulators are created by the application of an external periodic potential . as discussed in the main text , such a construction yields a superfluid state for the bosons , because the emergent @xmath18 gauge field @xmath19 is gapless and can be associated with the dual of the superfluid goldstone mode .    since the fermions form band insulators due to an external periodic potential , by themselves they have a preferred density , which is set by the number of fermions per unit cell .",
    "therefore it is not clear that the resulting state will be compressible , as changing the density would appear to cost a finite amount of energy .",
    "however , as we will explain below , such a construction does indeed yield a compressible state .",
    "the compressibility @xmath140 of a zero - temperature quantum system is defined as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the chemical potential , @xmath143 is the density , @xmath144 is the volume , and @xmath145 is the ground state energy for @xmath146 particles , and the above derivatives are taken at constant volume .",
    "thus we estimate the compressibility as @xmath147 where @xmath148 the system is incompressible if , when we take @xmath149 and @xmath150 , @xmath151 at fixed number density . in other words ,",
    "the system is compressible if @xmath152 the choice @xmath149 is for convenience ; more generally , one must take the limit @xmath153 with @xmath154 .    in our slave - particle construction above",
    ", it was argued in the main text that the gauge field fluctuations of @xmath19 are gapless . therefore consider a system of fermions with a filled band with a non - zero chern number , and subject it to a magnetic field that can vary with essentially zero energy cost .",
    "we now consider the energy @xmath155 , which is the ground state energy of the fermionic sector of the parton theory , with @xmath146 particles , and with additional @xmath35 flux quanta of @xmath19 added to the system .",
    "since the flux @xmath35 is a dynamical quantity , and the gauge field @xmath19 is gapless , the ground state energy @xmath156 , where the optimal @xmath157 is approximately the additional number of particles added to the system .",
    "now , we would like to know the fate of @xmath158 where now @xmath159 when the fermions fill a landau level , @xmath160 as @xmath150 .",
    "this is because the ground state energy of a filled lowest landau level is @xmath161 , where we set @xmath162 . from this",
    ", it follows that @xmath163 , where @xmath20 is the area of the system , so that @xmath164 , which is bounded as @xmath150 at fixed average number density @xmath165",
    ". thus the landau level problem gives a compressible state , if we allow the magnetic field to vary arbitrarily .",
    "this makes sense , since the density is only tied to the magnetic field , and once the magnetic field can vary arbitrarily , so can the density .",
    "now consider a chern insulator , such as haldane s honeycomb model with the lowest band filled @xcite .",
    "we would like to know whether @xmath166 if so , we can then conclude that the parton chern insulator construction of the superfulid will also be compressible if the gauge field @xmath19 is gapless .    to establish that ( [ cond ] )",
    "is true for such a situation , consider a continuum system with a constant magnetic field , _ ie a landau level problem , and consider adding a small periodic potential .",
    "let @xmath167 parametrize the strength of the periodic potential , and consider @xmath168 , where the last argument just parametrizes the value of @xmath167 in the hamiltonian . clearly for small @xmath169 , we must have @xmath170 furthermore , as long as we do not close the energy gap , continuously changing @xmath167",
    "must always preserve the above inequality .",
    "this is because as long as we do not close the energy gap , the ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit is analytic in @xmath167 , and so the above inequality must continue to be satisfied as @xmath167 is changed infinitesimally .",
    "_    now , we know that it is possible to , for instance , slowly turn on a honeycomb lattice potential with @xmath25 flux per plaquette , such that even in the limit that the periodic potential is much stronger than @xmath171 , we do not close the energy gap . in this limit",
    ", we end up with two bands , and if the lower band has chern number + 1 , then it is possible to adiabatically evolve from the continuum landau level to this situation .",
    "for the chern insulator with the lower band having @xmath5 and @xmath25 flux per plaquette , it follows that ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied , because we never had to close the energy gap as we increased the periodic potential . flipping the sign of",
    "the second nearest neighbor hopping in such a model can flip the chern number .",
    "we expect therefore that as long as @xmath5 or @xmath7 for the bottom band , that ( [ cond ] ) will remain true .",
    "we conclude that chern insulators , in addition to filled landau levels , will satisfy ( [ cond ] ) and are therefore compressible if the magnetic field is allowed to vary arbitrarily . since the fluctuations of the emergent @xmath18 gauge field are gapless in the parton construction of the superfluid , the magnetic field can indeed vary arbitrarily , so we see that the parton construction of the superfluid state is indeed compressible when the gauge fluctuations are taken into account ."

[ phasediag ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the superfluid is described by an order parameter while the fqh state is a topological phase without a local order parameter , such a transition is conceptually quite exotic @xcite . realizing it in the lab would be an experimental example of a continuous quantum transition in a clean system ( unlike qh plateau transitions ) which lies outside the ginzburg - landau paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> here , we will specialize to the case with fixed average particle number . </S>",
    "<S> we find that generically , in the absence of any additional symmetries besides particle number conservation , continuous transitions occur between the fqh state and mott insulator or the mott insulator and the superfluid . </S>",

    "<S> the parton construction is essentially equivalent to the composite fermion construction , although the former is preferable because it can describe a wider class of fqh states @xcite and can be formulated even in the absence of a background external magnetic field @xcite . in this paper </S>",
