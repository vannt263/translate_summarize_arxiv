    "rr  lyrae stars are classical pulsators oscillating in the radial modes .",
    "a majority of these stars are single - mode pulsators pulsating either in the fundamental mode ( f - mode , rrab stars ) or in the first overtone mode ( 1o - mode , rrc stars ) .",
    "less frequent is pulsation in the two modes simultaneously ( rrd stars ) .",
    "rr  lyrae stars play an important role in distance determination and in the studies of galactic structure and evolution .",
    "rrd stars , or multiperiodic pulsators in general , are important for the determination of basic stellar parameters , in particular of stellar masses ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rr  lyrae stars are relatively simple pulsators , nevertheless they are not well understood .",
    "the most stubborn problem is the origin of the blazhko effect  a long term quasi - periodic modulation of pulsation amplitude and phase @xcite .",
    "the other unsolved problem is mode selection mechanism .",
    "we do not know why some stars pulsate in two modes simultaneously and what is the mechanism behind ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "in the recent years our knowledge about rr  lyrae stars significantly increased .",
    "the progress is not only thanks to space photometry revolution , caused by space telescopes _ corot _ and _ kepler _ , but also thanks to long - term ground - based photometric sky surveys , like the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) .",
    "the ultra - precise photometry of space telescopes allows to investigate a relatively small sample of stars , but with unprecedented accuracy and detail . as a result",
    "our knowledge about the blazhko effect significantly increased .",
    "space photometry indicates that nearly @xmath2 per cent of rrab stars are affected by the blazhko effect @xcite .",
    "the most important discoveries are : detection of period doubling effect in about half of the modulated stars observed from space @xcite , detection of additional radial modes in the blazhko variables in the mmag regime ( mainly of the second overtone , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , multiple modulation periods and clear demonstration of irregular nature of the modulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although new models behind the blazhko modulation were proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we are still far from the solution of the blazhko puzzle ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "space photometry allowed clearly establishing a new group of double - mode pulsators , pulsating in the first overtone and in a yet not identified non - radial mode , with characteristic period ratio of the two modes in a narrow range around @xmath3 .",
    "such period ratios were also detected in rrd stars .",
    "first such stars were discovered in the _ most _ photometry and in the ground - based photometry of @xmath4  centauri @xcite .",
    "analysis of space observations of rrc and rrd stars indicates that this form of pulsation must be common ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and references therein , @xcite ) .",
    "nearly all rrc / rrd stars observed from space show the additional non - radial mode . a similar form of pulsation was detected in the first overtone cepheids , mostly in the ogle data @xcite",
    ". we do not understand this form of pulsation ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "many interesting discoveries come from analysis of data collected by the long - term ground based photometric campaigns , of which the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) is the longest and of highest photometric quality ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the large area of sky monitored by the ogle project allowed identification of several hundred thousands of pulsating stars only during the first three phases of the experiment .",
    "more than @xmath5 of rr  lyrae stars were identified in the ogle - iii and ogle - iv photometry of the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "such a large collection of rr  lyrae stars must contain unique objects .",
    "indeed , a few mode switching stars were reported @xcite , a gravitationally lensed rrc star was observed @xcite , and new type of pulsator mimicking rr  lyrae variability , binary evolution pulsator , was discovered ( bep ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ogle data is also perfect for search and study of non - radial modes of low amplitude .",
    "the study of galactic bulge ogle - iii data by @xcite increased a sample of known radial ",
    "non - radial double - mode pulsators by a factor of @xmath6 .",
    "yet another application is study of the blazhko effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of the blazhko - type modulation detected in several rrd stars from the ogle - iii and ogle - iv photometry of the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "these are the first objects of this type , in which modulation is observed on top of the genuine double - mode pulsation .",
    "the properties of the stars are studied in detail .",
    "we note that after @xcite announced the discovery of the first modulated rrd stars , @xcite also reported the modulated rrd stars in their photometry of m3 ( see also sec .",
    "[ ssec : dis_other ] ) .",
    "structure of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] we present the data and the adopted analysis methods .",
    "the general overview of the data with basic properties of double - mode pulsation and properties of modulation are presented in section  [ sec : overview ] . in section  [ sec : individual ]",
    "we discuss the analysis of individual stars in detail .",
    "discussion of the emerging picture of the modulation in rrd stars is in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "summary closes the paper .",
    "the i - band light curves we analyse in this paper were collected during the third and fourth phases of the optical gravitational lensing experiment . the ogle - iii project was conducted from 2001 to 2009 .",
    "the number of data points in the ogle - iii light curves varies strongly from field to field : from 335 to 2933 .",
    "ogle - iv is an ongoing survey started in march 2010 . in this study",
    "we have used the data obtained up to september 2014 , so the time span of the ogle - iv observations reaches 4.5 years , with the total number of the observational points from about 1000 to 10000 .",
    "the accuracy of the individual photometric measurements is better than 10mmag for most of the stars in our sample .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for description of the instrument setup and photometry reduction procedures .",
    "the photometry is publicly available and may be downloaded from the ogle ftp archive (; for the description see * ? ? ?",
    "the data were analysed using two techniques .",
    "the first is a standard successive prewhitening of the data with frequencies detected in the discrete fourier transform of the data . at each step",
    "the data are fitted with the sine series of the following form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 are independent frequencies detected in the data and their possible linear combinations .",
    "amplitudes , phases and frequencies are adjusted using the non - linear least square fitting procedure . we regard two frequencies , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as unresolved if distance between them @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is data length .",
    "only resolved signals are included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ss ] ) .",
    "for all analysed stars we first find _ full light curve solution _ : in the frequency spectrum of the residuals we do not detect any significant signal , or , what is more common , we can detect only unresolved power at the prewhitened frequencies , and possibly a signal at low frequencies  a signature of slow trends . at this phase",
    "the data are @xmath13 clipped , the trend is removed from the original data with polynomial of chosen order and again , light curve solution is updated and outliers at a lower @xmath14 level are removed .",
    "all further analysis is conducted on the resulting detrended time series with severe outliers removed .    in a majority of the cases , frequencies included in the full light curve solution",
    "are : frequencies of the fundamental mode and of the first overtone , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , their linear combinations , @xmath17 , and modulation components arising form the detected blazhko effect .",
    "these frequencies appear as equally spaced multiplet structures at @xmath15 , @xmath16 and their combinations , or as close doublets ( incomplete triplets , see next section for more details ) .",
    "the separation between the multiplet ( doublet ) components defines the modulation ( blazhko ) frequency , @xmath18 , and modulation period , @xmath19 .",
    "if the modulation period is longer than @xmath20 , or pulsation mode ( its amplitude and/or phase ) vary on a long time - scale , unresolved power will remain in the frequency spectrum at @xmath15 and/or at @xmath16 after prewhitening . in the case of ogle - iv data @xmath21d and the longest possible modulation we can detect is @xmath22days . in the combined ogle - iii and ogle - iv data",
    "this limit is longer , up to @xmath23days ( depending on the time span of ogle - iii observations ) .    by default",
    "the analysis is based on ogle - iv data which are more densely sampled .",
    "when we suspect long - term modulation / variation of the radial modes , and ogle - iii data are available , we also analyse the merged data .",
    "we note that there are systematic differences in the zero - points in ogle - iii and ogle - iv data , which may be as high as @xmath24mag in extreme cases @xcite . to correctly merge the data we first find the full light curve solution for ogle - iii and for ogle - iv data independently , as described above .",
    "the mean brightness difference , @xmath25 , between ogle - iii and ogle - iv data is then taken into account when merging the data .",
    "the side peaks at the radial mode frequencies can also be non - coherent , i.e. they can not be prewhitened with a single sine wave with constant amplitude and phase .",
    "after prewhitening , residual , unresolved power remains in the spectrum .",
    "the presence of such signals is not a surprise  they may originate from the non - periodic nature of the light variation , which is expected .",
    "the blazhko effect in single periodic rr  lyrae stars is a quasi - periodic effect .",
    "the results of space missions leave no doubt : consecutive blazhko cycles differ , modulation periods and amplitudes sometimes change in an irregular fashion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to analyse the modulation and/or possible long - term variation of the radial modes in more detail , we adopted the second technique , the time - dependent fourier analysis @xcite in some cases followed by time - dependent prewhitening @xcite . in a nutshell ,",
    "the data are divided into chunks or subsets of approximately the same length , @xmath26 .",
    "then , for each of the subsets we fit the sine series ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ss ] ) with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and their linear combinations detected in the full data set .",
    "these frequencies are kept fixed , i.e. are the same for all subsets  we adjust amplitudes , phases , and mean brightness only .",
    "any variation of mode frequencies is then reflected in the variation of respective phases . the difference between the instantaneous and the mean frequency is : @xmath27 using this method we can study the variation of mode s amplitudes and periods on time - scale longer than @xmath26 . for a few stars with ogle - iv photometry",
    "the data sampling is dense enough to use @xmath26 as low as @xmath28days . to characterise the data sampling",
    "we calculate the mean number of data points per @xmath29days , @xmath30 in the following .",
    "the gaps between observing seasons are excluded when estimating @xmath30 .",
    "this parameter vary from @xmath31 to more than @xmath32 in the ogle - iv data ( typically above @xmath33 ) and from @xmath34 to @xmath35 in the ogle - iii data .",
    "if variation occurs on a long time - scale ( of order of data length ) and is irregular it produces unresolved power in the frequency spectrum at @xmath15 and/or at @xmath16 , which increases the noise level in the fourier transform and may hide e.g. the signs of modulation on the shorter time - scale .",
    "to get rid of these unwanted signal we follow the time - dependent fourier analysis by the time - dependent prewhitening @xcite .",
    "the residuals from the just described sine series fits , separate for each of the subsets , are merged . in a resulting time series the long - term variability is filtered out , while short - term modulation remains .",
    "of course @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and their combinations are also prewhitened and should not appear in the frequency spectrum , provided they do not vary significantly on a time - scale shorter than @xmath26 .    all analysis described in this paper",
    "was conducted using the software written by one of us ( rs ) .",
    "in this study we analyse rrd stars suspected of long - term modulation of radial - modes , the blazhko effect .",
    "the sample was first preselected by ( _ i _ ) visual inspection ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig.ts ] for obvious signature of modulation and ( _ ii _ ) by automatic analysis of frequency spectra of all rrd stars . in the latter case ,",
    "the stars showing additional close side peaks at the fundamental and/or at the first overtone frequency were marked as suspected of long - term modulation .",
    "for details on the automatic analysis of frequency spectrum , see @xcite .",
    "the selected sample contained 16 stars ( primary targets ) .",
    "our analysis showed that nearly all of these rrd stars that show the modulation , have non - typical period ratios ( see fig .  [ fig.pet ] ) .",
    "therefore , the sample was extended with 11 other stars ( secondary targets ) having non - typical period ratios , of which in two we detected modulation .",
    "altogether @xmath36 stars were analysed in detail ( marked with large symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] ) and in 15 ( marked with diamonds / pentagon ) we found modulation of at least one radial mode .",
    "all of the investigated stars pulsate simultaneously in the fundamental and in the first overtone modes ( rrd ) . in all cases we detect combination frequencies of @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    " no doubt the two frequencies originate from the same star . in all but two cases the period ratios @xmath37 are rather far from that typical for a majority of the galactic bulge rrd stars",
    " see the petersen diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.pet ] .",
    "the two stars that fit the main progression are also not - typical  they are located at nearly the same place , at a clump of 28 stars  the likely members of a tidal stream crossing the galactic bulge , as analysed by @xcite .",
    "we will comment the non - typical location of modulated stars in the petersen diagram in the discussion ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : dis_pet ] ) . in tab .",
    "[ tab : dm ] we collect periods , period ratio and amplitudes of the fundamental and first overtone modes . these values come from the full light curve solution of ogle - iv data , only , and are mean values ( see tables in the appendix in the on - line version of the journal ) .",
    "the solutions include frequencies of both modes , their combinations and all additional close side peaks we could detect in the data . if the peak at @xmath15 or at @xmath16 is non - coherent , its amplitude is marked with asterisk in tab .",
