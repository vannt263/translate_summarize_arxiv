    "the information contained in protein sequences can be represented by intrinsic profiles , such as hydrophobicity @xcite , charge , and secondary structure propensities .",
    "structural information can also be reduced to one - dimensional profiles describing structural and chemical properties of the amino acids @xcite , including secondary structure and solvent accessibility @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the hydrophobicity profile ( hp ) is correlated with the solvent accessibility of the native structure @xcite , indicating that sequence and structure profiles are intimately related @xcite .    in order to gain further insight into the sequence - structure relationship",
    ", we represent both protein sequences and protein structures as vectors in an @xmath0-dimensional space , denoted as vectorial protein space , and study their mutual relationship . in this work ,",
    "we adopt a structural representation of proteins based on the principal eigenvector of the native contact matrix ( pe ) .",
    "the pe has already been used as an indicator of protein topology , in particular as a mean of identifying structural domains @xcite and clusters of amino acids with special structural significance @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that knowledge of the pe suffices to reconstruct the complete contact matrix of single - domain globular proteins @xcite .",
    "protein sequences are here represented through their hp @xcite .",
    "we introduce a new generalized hydrophobicity scale that is based on the principal eigenvector of a residue - residue interaction matrix .",
    "this scale , which we call _ interactivity _ , correlates strongly with empirical hydrophobicity scales , even if it incorporates also other interactions besides the hydrophobic effect .",
    "the inclusion of the native fold s effective free energy in the new interactivity scale is crucial for deducing the relationship between pe and hp .",
    "we define the optimal hp for a given fold and show that a strong correlation can be expected between this optimal hp and the pe .",
    "thus , the optimal hp carries the `` hydrophobic fingerprint '' of a protein fold . while we do not expect that the optimal hp is realized in protein evolution , we do expect that protein evolution is confined in a region of sequence space centered around the optimal hp , so that the evolutionary average of the hp over sequences sharing the same fold should more strongly resemble the optimal hp .    to test this expectation",
    ", we performed an evolutionary analysis using two kinds of protein sets : ( i )  the pfam @xcite and fssp @xcite databases , containing sequences of protein families adopting the same fold , and ( ii )  the scn database , containing sequences of seven protein families obtained through the structurally constrained neutral ( scn ) model of evolution @xcite that imposes the conservation of the thermodynamic stability of the native fold .",
    "for all three databases we found that the hp of individual sequences are positively correlated to the pe , yet the evolutionary average of the hp is more strongly correlated to it than each sequence individually .",
    "this finding suggests that the hp of a protein sequence encodes a large part of the information on the pe of the native contact matrix and hence on the native structure .",
    "the correlation between the average hp and the pe allows deriving a site - specific pattern of sequence conservation , which can be used in evolutionary studies .",
    "representing protein structures in the same vector space as protein sequences permits to define a distance measure , based on the correlation coefficient , which is applicable to sequence - sequence , structure - structure , as well as sequence - structure comparisons .",
    "this definition provides a unified framework for all kinds of protein alignments . in this context , we compared the similarity score based on the hydrophobicity correlation ( hc ) , already proposed by sweet and eisenberg @xcite , with the widely used blosum @xcite score , using as benchmark a set of distantly related proteins sharing the tim barrel fold @xcite .",
    "we also derived independently optimal parameters for sequence - structure and for sequence - sequence comparisons . in both cases ,",
    "the interactivity parameters are almost identical with the optimal ones .",
    "the contact matrix @xmath1 is a binary matrix , with elements @xmath2 if amino acids at positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in contact , and @xmath5 otherwise .",
    "only residues separated by at least three positions along the sequence are considered in contact , so that @xmath6 for all @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath7 .",
    "two residues are considered to be in contact if any two of their heavy atoms are closer than @xmath8 in space .",
    "therefore , the contact condition depends on the size of the amino acids at positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the contact matrix is an @xmath9 symmetric matrix , it has @xmath0 real eigenvalues @xmath10 , @xmath11 , which we rank in decreasing order .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath12 form an orthonormal system .      from the contact matrix @xmath1 , we define a vectorial representation @xmath13 , which we call the effective connectivity , such that positions @xmath3 with large @xmath14 are in contact with as many as possible positions @xmath4 with large @xmath15 . this self - consistent definition can be formally expressed through the condition that the vector @xmath13 maximizes the quadratic form @xmath16 with the normalization condition @xmath17 .",
    "the solution of this maximization problem is the principal eigenvector ( pe ) of the contact matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath18 , @xmath19 . in the following ,",
    "we denote the pe by @xmath20 instead of @xmath21 .    from this maximization property",
    ", it follows that the largest positive eigenvalue @xmath18 has a value ranging between the average number of contacts per residue , @xmath22 , and the maximal number of contacts of any given residue , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in addition , since all elements of @xmath1 are positive or zero , the pe has all components of the same sign or zero .",
    "we choose by convention the positive sign .",
    "pe components are zero only for residues that do not form contacts with residues with non - vanishing pe . vanishing pe components may indicate a domain decomposition of the protein structure .",
    "the components of the pe outside the main domain are never exactly zero , but their value is much smaller than inside the main domain . the algorithm for automatic domain decomposition proposed by holm and sander @xcite",
    "is based on a similar idea .",
    "for this reason , multi - domain proteins are expected to have a larger variance of their pe components than single - domain ones .",
    "a study of the protein data bank ( pdb ) has confirmed this expectation ( data not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we use as a signature for single - domain proteins a small relative variance of the pe , the latter defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "both the pe and the hp are vectors in an @xmath0-dimensional space , where @xmath0 is the number of amino acids .",
    "the most natural way of defining a similarity measure in this space is through the normalized scalar product : the cosine of the angle @xmath26 between two vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity , however , is strongly dependent on the average value of the two vectors , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is therefore more convenient to use as similarity measure pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath32 , which is the normalized scalar product of the vectors with components @xmath33 and @xmath34 and is defined as @xmath35 \\left [ \\sum_i \\left ( y_i - \\big < y \\big > \\right)^2 \\right ] } } \\ , .\\ ] ]      we will use in the following a simple model of protein thermodynamics . in this model ,",
    "the free energy of a sequence @xmath36 folded into a contact map @xmath1 is approximated by an effective contact free energy function @xmath37 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 symmetric matrix with @xmath41 representing the effective interaction , in units of @xmath42 , of amino acids @xmath43 and @xmath44 when they are in contact .",
    "we use the interaction matrix derived by bastolla _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the structurally constrained neutral ( scn ) model @xcite is based on mutations and purifying selection .",
    "selection is imposed requiring that the folding free energy and the normalized energy gap of the native structure , calculated through the effective free energy function eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) @xcite , are above predetermined thresholds .",
    "the model reproduces the main qualitative features of protein sequence evolution and allows structurally based sequence conservation for specific protein folds to be predicted @xcite .",
    "the conservation values estimated through the scn model are in agreement with those measured in the corresponding fssp family , with the exception of functionally constrained positions , which are not conserved in our model @xcite .",
    "we studied in detail seven protein folds with different length @xmath0 : the tim barrel ( @xmath45 , pdb code ` 7tim_a ` ) , the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ( @xmath46 , pdb code ` 1u9a_a ` ) , myoglobin ( @xmath47 , pdb code ` 1a6 g ` ) , lysozyme ( @xmath48 , pdb code ` 3lzt ` ) , ribonuclease ( @xmath49 , pdb code ` 7rsa ` ) , cytochrome  c ( @xmath50 , pdb code ` 451c ` ) , rubredoxin ( @xmath51 , mesophilic : pdb code ` 1iro ` ; thermophilic : pdb code ` 1brf_a ` ) .    for each fold",
    ", we collected three families of aligned sequences expected to belong to the same structural class : ( i )  the pfam family @xcite , grouped through sequence comparison techniques .",
    "( ii )  the fssp family @xcite , grouped through structure comparison techniques .",
    "( iii )  the scn family @xcite , obtained by simulating molecular evolution with the constraint that the thermodynamic stability of the native structure must be conserved .      in this work ,",
    "we use generalized hydrophobicity parameters that are obtained from the principal eigenvector of the interaction matrix represented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) @xcite .",
    "we call this set of parameters the _ interactivity _ parameters , and we use them to obtain a vectorial representation of protein sequences .",
    "protein structures are also represented as vectors through the principal eigenvector ( pe ) of their contact matrix .",
    "we will show here that the interactivity parameters simultaneously confer high similarity score , _",
    "i.e. _ high correlation coefficient , ( a )  to pairs of vectors representing a protein sequence and its native structure , and ( b )  to pairs of distantly related sequences sharing the same structure ( see below ) .",
    "we also determined two new sets of 20 normalized parameters by maximizing the two scores ( a ) and ( b ) respectively , averaged over a training set of proteins . for the optimization we adopted an _ ad hoc _ method based on the fact that a generic parameter set can be written as a linear combination of the @xmath52 eigenvectors of the interaction matrix @xmath39 .",
    "for parameter sets consisting of a single eigenvector , the score is large for the principal eigenvector , medium for a few eigenvectors and low for all other ones .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the optimal set will be a combination of a small number of eigenvectors .",
    "our method works in three steps .",
    "( i )  for all @xmath53 combinations of four eigenvectors of @xmath39 ( always including the principal one ) , we maximized the average score as a function of the three corresponding coefficients ( one is fixed by the normalization condition ) , using exact enumeration with large steps .",
    "( ii )  we selected the six combinations of four eigenvectors giving the largest scores and we optimized the coefficients using smaller steps .",
    "( iii )  we checked that addition of each of the remaining eigenvectors did not improve the result significantly .    in case ( a )",
    ", we used as training set the single - domain globular proteins described below . in case",
    "( b ) , the similarity score @xmath54 was calculated for pairs of distantly related sequences with the tim barrel fold . in both cases ,",
    "the optimization was also performed with standard monte carlo techniques , yielding a very similar result . in case",
    "( b ) , we did not optimize the placement of gaps at the same time , but we used gapped alignments obtained through structural superposition downloaded from the dali server ( ` http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/fssp/ ` ) .",
    "we computed the correlation between hp and pe for a subset of non - redundant single - domain globular proteins ( @xmath55 single - domain structures of length @xmath56 ) .",
    "we tested the condition of globularity by imposing that the fraction of contacts per residue was larger than a length dependent threshold , @xmath57 .",
    "this functional form represents the scaling of the number of contacts in globular proteins as a function of chain length ( the factor @xmath58 comes from the surface to volume ratio ) , and the two parameters were chosen so to eliminate outliers with respect to the general trend , which are mainly non - globular structures .",
    "the condition of being single - domain was imposed by checking that the variance of the pe components , eq .",

    "we investigate the relationship between protein sequence and structure using an effective folding free energy function , based on the pairwise interaction matrix @xmath39 , see eq .",
