    "the current classical theory of gravity is very successful both in providing a broad theoretical framework and in its agreement with experiments .",
    "however , in its present form it is also incomplete in the sense that ( i ) it does not include in one integrated picture the causal notion of singularities ; and ( ii ) it does not contain an intrinsic notion of entropy that it is of crucial importance for the study of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the latter issue has motivated several ideas about the integration of gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "some interesting examples are jacobson s interpretation of einstein s equations as equations of state @xcite , padmanabhan s programme on gravity as a thermodynamic theory @xcite and verlinde s interpretation of gravity as an entropic force @xcite  see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a related review .    at present ,",
    "most discussions on gravitational entropy focus on the entropy of horizons ( black hole or particle horizons ) , for which precise mathematical expressions exist .",
    "however , horizons are not the only gravitational entities to which entropy can be assigned . in particular , penrose has proposed the association of entropy with gravitational singularities as a way to obtain a thermodynamically consistent description of cosmology @xcite . a concrete expression for the entropy of singularities , which is currently missing ( at least for singularities in lorentzian space - times ) , would greatly increase the scope of the search for a general theory of gravitational entropy .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a concrete expression for the entropy associated to a class of spacetime singularities , using elementary principles of general relativity and thermodynamics .",
    "this result provides a direct verification of the conjecture that ( at least some of ) the singularities can be viewed as thermodynamic objects .",
    "the key idea is the following .",
    "if the gravitational degrees of freedom are carriers of entropy , then the total entropy in a gravitating system should be the sum of matter entropy and gravitational entropy ( plus a small term due to their interaction . ) however , the form of any entropy functional is constrained by requirements of thermodynamic consistency .",
    "in particular , a well - defined entropy functional should allow for the implementation of the _ maximum - entropy principle _ : in an equilibrium state , all unconstrained parameters describing a physical system take values that maximize the entropy functional .",
    "if one ignores the contribution of gravitational entropy , the resulting entropy functional may fail to satisfy defining properties of entropy and thus , misidentify the physical equilibrium states .",
    "hence , the requirement that the entropy functional satisfies basic thermodynamic consistency conditions could allow us to infer the form and properties of any contribution to entropy from the gravitational field .",
    "we show that this idea is successfully implemented in static , spherically symmetric solutions to einstein equations describing self - gravitating radiation @xcite .",
    "it leads to an expression for gravitational entropy that is defined in terms of the properties the spacetime singularities that generically appear in these solutions .",
    "the key physical requirement in this paper is the consistency of the thermodynamic description .",
    "it is , however , to be noted that the presence of a long - range force such as gravity leads to a significant modification of the usual thermodynamical properties  for reviews , see , refs .",
    "@xcite . most important is the loss of extensivity in the thermodynamic potentials . in ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the entropy is an extensive function on the system s thermodynamic state space @xmath0 : @xmath1 , for any @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is not the case in gravity , even though in certain systems other scaling properties exist @xcite .",
    "the loss of extensivity implies that : the equilibrium configurations are inhomogeneous ; the heat capacity may become negative , even though the specific heat of each volume element is positive @xcite ; the microcanonical and the canonical distribution are not equivalent @xcite ; and , crucially , matter entropy may not have global maxima for fixed values of energy @xcite .",
    "thus , many concepts of ordinary equilibrium thermodynamic concepts must be modified in order to fit the gravitational context .",
    "nonetheless , black hole entropy suggests that the thermodynamic description constitutes a fundamental element of gravitational physics .",
    "for this reason , the fundamental principles of thermodynamics , as encapsulated in its basic laws , can be expected to hold even in a less stringent form . in this regard",
    ", we note that many concepts of the axiomatic approaches to equilibrium thermodynamics  for example @xcite  are applicable in the gravitational context . in these approaches , entropy is viewed as a function on a state space of macroscopic observables that determines the allowed transitions of a physical system , and thus it can be defined irrespective of whether the extensivity property is satisfied or not . in particular , the maximum - entropy principle , which is the key thermodynamic principle employed in this paper , is based on the statistical interpretation of entropy and on the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "these are universal principles and they are expected to apply also to gravitating systems .    with these considerations in mind",
    "we revisit the thermodynamics of static , spherically symmetric solutions to einstein equations corresponding to radiation in a box .",
    "the stationarity assumption allows us to employ notions of equilibrium thermodynamics  entropy in the full gravity theory would require notions of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "spherical symmetry implies that the local degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are frozen , so that any contribution to the gravitational entropy would be ` topological ' . in the present context",
    ", this means that gravitational entropy can be identified with the entropy of singularities  or possibly with entropy associated to internal boundaries .",
    "we chose the case of self - gravitating radiation @xcite , because its thermodynamic description is simple : the equation of state is linear and it contains no scale parameters .",
    "this allows for a semi - analytic treatment of the system and a relatively straightforward determination of the gravitational contributions to entropy .",
    "furthermore , the equation of state for radiation is expected to be physically meaningful even when the energy density varies over many orders of magnitude .",
    "the basic thermodynamic variables for self - gravitating radiation in a box are the ones accessible to an observer outside the box , namely , the area @xmath4 of the box , the local temperature @xmath5 of the box and the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass @xmath6 . the variables @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 define the boundary conditions of einstein equations for this system .",
    "they can be varied independently , each choice of @xmath8 defining a different solution to einstein s equations .",
    "however , @xmath7 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 are not independent , when viewed as thermodynamic variables . for fixed size of the bounding box ,",
    "the temperature of radiation is a function of the total energy .",
    "thus , states of thermal equilibrium satisfy a _ structure relation _ of the form @xmath9 , which can not be determined by einstein s equations alone .",
    "the standard treatment of static spherically symmetric solutions to einstein s equations introduces an additional assumption , of regularity at the center ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite for self - gravitating radiation ) .",
    "regular solutions form a set of measure zero in the space of all solutions ; most solutions have a conical singularity at the center .",
    "the restriction to regular solutions follows mainly from the desire to avoid gravitational singularities , but it also provides the additional condition that is necessary in order to derive the thermodynamic structure equation @xmath9 .",
    "however , the regularity condition has no thermodynamic justification .",
    "for example , it is not obtained from the extremization of any thermodynamic potential . if we assume that general relativity arises as the macroscopic limit of an underlying microscopic theory , the lack of a fundamental justification for the regularity condition poses a severe problem .",
    "there should be some physical mechanism guaranteeing the stability of regular solutions against statistical or quantum fluctuations of the microscopic degrees of freedom . at the macroscopic level",
    ", such a mechanism should be described in the language of thermodynamics .",
    "regular solutions exist only in a specific sector of the thermodynamic state space . outside this sector",
    ", the regularity condition can not identify the equilibrium states .",
    "again , this is problematic from the thermodynamic point of view . to see this",
    ", we note that for regular solutions there is an upper bound @xmath10 on the temperature of the bounding box for a given value of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "suppose that we bring the box into contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "one expects that the box also acquires temperature equal to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "but there exists no regular solution with this property , so we have no way to determine the resulting equilibrium configuration .",
    "thus , the regularity condition does not suffice to describe even elementary thermodynamic operations to the system .",
    "in ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics , when the external constraints ( boundary conditions ) to a system do not suffice to determine the system s state , the maximum - entropy principle is invoked @xcite . however , the entropy @xmath12 of self - gravitating radiation does not have global maxima for fixed values of energy .",
    "thus , the maximum - entropy principle does not recover the regular solutions , even at the limit of weak gravity .",
    "this is a severe consistency problem , because at this limit we expect the ordinary thermodynamics of a photon gas to provide an excellent approximation .",
    "the problems above are resolved by the assumption that an entropy @xmath13 is associated to the singularities characterizing the solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "@xmath13 is defined only by the asymptotic behavior of the fields near the singularity , and its form is determined by the requirement that the total entropy @xmath14 is maximized at the regular solutions .",
    "thus , _ the regularity condition arises as a consequence of the maximum - entropy principle_. the maximum - entropy principle also determines the equilibrium configurations in the sector where no regular solutions exist .",
    "we find two phases of singular equilibrium solutions in addition to the phase of regular solutions .",
    "it is important to emphasize that there are strong constraints to the form of @xmath13 , arising from requirements of thermodynamic and mathematical consistency .",
    "these constraints are so stringent , that it is _ a priori _ unlikely that they can be satisfied accidentally , or even by fine - tuning .",
    "hence , the existence of an expression for @xmath13 that satisfies the constraints is highly remarkable .",
    "it is even more so , because @xmath13 has a very simple form , and there are plausible arguments suggesting that it is unique .",
    "for this reason , we believe that the expression for @xmath13 , determined here , is of a fundamental origin and it extracts information that is deeply embedded into the structure of einstein s equations",
    ". further elaboration of these ideas into other systems could provide significant novel information towards a general theory of gravitational entropy .",
    "the association of an entropy @xmath13 to the singularities does not necessarily imply a commitment into the physical existence of singularities . as we explain in more detail in sec .",
    "3.2 , we view @xmath13 as a mathematical term , defined by the asymptotic field values on the singularity , that is included in the total entropy in order to obtain a consistent thermodynamic description of the system .",
    "the expressions `` entropy of singularity '' and `` singularity entropy '' employed in this paper are to be understood in this sense .",
    "they do not imply the existence of the singularity as a physical entity that possesses entropy .",
    "the definition and properties of the entropy @xmath13 is consistent with the idea of an intrinsic thermodynamic character of gravity .",
    "borrowing padmanabhan s analogy of spacetime to an elastic solid @xcite , the singularities can be viewed as analogous to defects in the solid . for weak external stress ,",
    "the solid s equilibrium state is smooth and regular , but if the stress increases beyond a critical value , no globally regular configuration exists : configurations with defects are entropically favored .",
    "the thermodynamic picture of gravity provides an important shift of perspective : the singularities are not pathologies in the description of the system , but they may indicate a different thermodynamic ` phase ' that is entropically favored for certain boundary conditions .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "2 , we study in detail the properties of the singular solutions of the oppenheimer - volkoff equations for self - gravitating radiation in a spherical box . in sec . 3",
    ", we define the singularity entropy @xmath13 and we show that the regular solutions are indeed obtained by a maximum - entropy principle .",
    "we also identify the phase of singular equilibrium solutions and study the corresponding phase transitions . in sec .",

    "the thermodynamic system under consideration is a spherical box of area @xmath15 containing a self - gravitating photon gas in thermal equilibrium .",

    "we work entirely within the confines of the classical theory , so @xmath21 does not appear . it is therefore convenient to choose units where @xmath22 .",
    "assuming that the system is in equilibrium , we consider only static solutions to einstein s equations .",

    "this simple relation is lost in the singular phase , because singular solutions are characterized by an internal boundary at the singularity .",

    "the answer is negative for the following reasons .    a black hole horizon , endowed with thermodynamic properties ,",
    "is expected to emit hawking radiation .",
    "the presence of a bounding box implies that this radiation does not escape to infinity .",
    "thus , the equilibrium configuration should correspond to the horizon coexisting with its hawking radiation .",
    "the local temperature @xmath5 at the bounding box would equal the hawking temperature blueshifted by a factor of @xmath366 , as in ref .",
    "but , as we showed in sec . 2.3 , there is no solution of the oppenheimer - volkoff equations with both non - zero temperature at the boundary and an horizon .",
    "we would have to modify the constitutive equations of the system in order to introduce the bekenstein - hawking entropy into the present set - up .",
    "such modifications could arise from the consideration of quantum corrections to einstein s equations , or from the inclusion of the effect of acceleration radiation , or from modifications to the equation of state for radiation near the horizon @xcite .",
    "however , any modification would affect the entropy of the system ( both of radiation and of the singularities ) , possibly introducing additional terms with different scaling properties . as a matter of fact",

    "the eventual aim is to identify gravitational entropy within the broadest framework where the principles of equilibrium thermodynamics are applicable , namely , for general static solutions to einstein s equations .",
    "the main limitation of the present results is the fact that they are based on numerical solution of the oppenheimer - volkoff equations , rather than a full analytic derivation .",

    "thus , any results obtained from this method can , in principle , be employed in order to constrain candidate quantum theories of gravity .",
    "the study of phase transitions is perhaps the most important in this direction . as explained in sec .",
    "3.5 , the maximum - entropy principle is not adequate for the description of the systems near the critical point .",

    ". if the gravitational phase transitions exhibit universality , then the identification of a universality class could provide novel information about the symmetries of the underlying microscopic theory .",

    "this perspective might have implications in the theory of stellar stability , where physical solutions are standardly selected by the regularity assumption . a thermodynamic treatment of systems with realistic equations of state ,",
    "could uncover a new phase of singular equilibrium solutions , similar to the s - phase appearing in self - gravitating radiation .",
