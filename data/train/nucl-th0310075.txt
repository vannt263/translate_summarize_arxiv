    "it is widely believed that hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition to quark matter at high densities and/or high temperatures .",
    "the high temperature limit is important in heavy ion collisions and/or cosmology , whereas the high baryon density behavior is important for the study of neutron , hybrid and quark stars .    after a gravitational colapse of",
    "a massive star takes place , a neutron star with practically zero temperature can be born few seconds after deleptonization .",
    "the correct calculations of the star properties depend on the appropriate equations of state ( eos ) that describe its crust and interior .",
    "the crust of the neutron star , where density is low is believed to be adequately described by hadronic matter .",
    "its interior , however , where density is of the order of @xmath0 times nuclear saturation density remains to be properly understood .",
    "whether the central part of the star is composed of quark matter only , of mixed matter or of paired quark matter is one of the subjects of the present work .    in the present paper",
    "we are interested in building the eos for mixed matter of quark and hadron phases .",
    "we employ the quark - meson coupling model ( qmc )  @xcite including hyperons in order to describe the hadron phase . in the qmc model ,",
    "baryons are described as a system of non - overlapping mit bags which interact through the effective scalar and vector mean fields , very much in the same way as in the walecka model ( qhd ) @xcite .",
    "many applications and extensions of the model have been made in the last years @xcite .    while the qmc model shares many similarities with qhd - type models , it however offers new opportunities for studying nuclear matter properties .",
    "one of the most attractive aspects of the model is that different phases of hadronic matter , from very low to very high baryon densities and temperatures , can be described within the same underlying model , namely the mit bag model . in the qmc ,",
    "matter at low densities and temperatures is a system of nucleons interacting through meson fields , with quarks and gluons confined within mit bag . for matter at very high density and/or temperature , one expects that baryons and mesons dissolve and the entire system of quarks and gluons becomes confined within a single , big mit bag .",
    "another important aspect of the qmc is that the internal structure of the nucleon is introduced explicitly .",
    "it is found that the eos for infinite nuclear matter at zero temperature derived from the qmc model is much softer than the one obtained in the walecka model  @xcite . also , the qmc model nucleon effective mass lies in the range @xmath1 to @xmath2 of the free nucleon mass , which agrees with results derived from non - relativistic analysis of scattering of neutrons from lead nuclei  @xcite and is larger in comparison with walecka model effective mass .",
    "consequently , we expect that contrary to the nl3 and tm1 parameterizations of the non linear walecka model ( nlwm ) with hyperons , the mass of the nucleon does not become zero at densities @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the density of nuclear matter at saturation . at finite temperature , there arises yet another difference between predictions of qmc and qhd , namely the behavior of the effective nucleon mass with the temperature at fixed baryon density . while in qhd - type models the nucleon mass always decreases with temperature , in the qmc it increases .",
    "the difference arises because of the explicit treatment of the internal structure of the nucleon in the qmc . when the bag is heated up , quark - antiquark pairs are excited in the interior of the bag , increasing the internal energy of the bag @xcite . in what follows",
    "we consider the qmc with a constant bag constant , e. g. not dependent on the scalar meson field as in the modified quark meson coupling models ( mqmc ) @xcite.contrary to the qmc result , the bag radius increases with density for all mqmc models with a meson dependent bag constant @xcite . for densities not much larger than nuclear matter saturation density @xmath4",
    "the bags start to overlap which implies a breakdown of the model . in the present work we are interested in describing properties of nuclear matter for densities which go beyond the saturation density and",
    "therefore have chosen to consider the qmc model .    for the quark phase",
    "we have chosen to use both unpaired quark matter ( uqm ) described by the mit bag model @xcite and paired quarks described by the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase .",
    "recently many authors @xcite have discussed the possibility that the quark matter is in a color - superconducting phase , in which quarks near the fermi surface are paired , forming cooper pairs which condense and break the color gauge symmetry @xcite . at sufficiently high density",
    "the favored phase is called cfl , in which quarks of all three colors and all three flavors are allowed to pair .    once the mixed eos is built by enforcing appropriate gibbs criteria and chemical equilibrium conditions , the properties of the stars are calculated and discussed .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the investigation of neutron stars ( @xmath5 ) and hence , neutrino trapping is not an expected mechanism because it is important only during the first seconds after gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star @xcite .    in recent works @xcite ,",
    "two of us have studied the properties of mixed stars whose equations of state were built with the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) for the hadron matter @xcite and the mit bag @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio @xcite models for the unpaired quark matter . in the first work @xcite the effects of temperature were investigated and in the second one the consequences of imposing neutrino trapping at fixed entropies were studied . in both works , only in very special cases , the interior of the stars were made of quarks only . in general ,",
    "a mixed phase of hadrons and quarks was favored .    in what follows",
    "we compare the properties of neutron stars obtained within the qmc model with hyperons and with both quark models discussed above , namely , the onset of hyperons , mixed and quark phases , strangeness content , the maximum allowed masses and core composition .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section ii the qmc model with hyperons is reviewed . in sections iii and iv the unpaired quark matter and the cfl phase are described . in section v the mixed phase is implemented and the results are shown and discussed in section vi .",
    "finally , in the last section , the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in the qmc model , the nucleon in nuclear medium is assumed to be a static spherical mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar and vector fields , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 and these fields are treated as classical fields in the mean field approximation .",
    "the quark field , @xmath9 , inside the bag then satisfies the equation of motion : @xmath10 \\,\\psi_q(x)=0\\ , \\quad   q = u , d , s , \\label{eq - motion}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the current quark mass , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 and denote the quark - meson coupling constants .",

    "the quantities @xmath22 all depend on the baryon considered .",
    "the bag eigenvalue , @xmath23 , is determined by the boundary condition at the bag surface @xmath24 the energy of a static bag describing baryon @xmath25 consisting of three ground state quarks can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a parameter which accounts for zero - point motion and @xmath28 is the bag constant .",
    "the set of parameters used in the present work is given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the effective mass of a nucleon bag at rest is taken to be @xmath29 the equilibrium condition for the bag is obtained by minimizing the effective mass , @xmath30 with respect to the bag radius @xmath31 for the qmc model , the equations of motion for the meson fields in uniform static matter are given by @xmath32^{1/2 } } \\ : k^2 \\ dk ~ , \\label{field1}\\ ] ] @xmath33 @xmath34 in the above equations @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the spin , isospin projection and the fermi momentum of the baryon species @xmath25 .",
    "the hyperon couplings are not relevant to the ground state properties of nuclear matter , but information about them can be available from the levels in @xmath38 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are equal to @xmath43 for the nucleons and acquire different values in different parameterizations for the other baryons .",
    "note that the @xmath44-quark is unaffected by the sigma and omega mesons i.e. @xmath45    in eq .",

    "the equilibrium composition of the star is obtained by solving the set of eqs .",
    "( [ field1])- ( [ field3 ] ) in conjunction with the charge neutrality condition ( [ neutral ] ) at a given total baryonic density @xmath52 ; the baryon effective masses are obtained self - consistently in the bag model .    for stars in which the strongly interacting particles are baryons , the composition is determined by the requirements of charge neutrality and @xmath53-equilibrium conditions under the weak processes @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "after deleptonization , the charge neutrality condition yields @xmath56 where @xmath57 corresponds to the electric charge of baryon species @xmath25 and @xmath58 corresponds to the electric charge of lepton species @xmath59 . since the time scale of a star is effectively infinite compared to the weak interaction time scale , weak interaction violates strangeness conservation .",
    "the strangeness quantum number is therefore not conserved in a star and the net strangeness is determined by the condition of @xmath53-equilibrium which for baryon @xmath25 is then given by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the chemical potential of baryon @xmath25 and @xmath62 its baryon number .",
    "thus the chemical potential of any baryon can be obtained from the two independent chemical potentials @xmath63 and @xmath64 of neutron and electron respectively .",
    "we start by fixing the free - space bag properties for the qmc model .",
    "for the bag radius @xmath65 , we first fixed the two unknowns @xmath66 and @xmath67 for nucleons .",
    "these are obtained by fitting the neuclon mass @xmath68 mev and enforcing the stability condition for the bag at free space .",
    "the values obtained are @xmath69 and @xmath70 mev for @xmath71 mev and @xmath72 and @xmath73 mev for @xmath74 mev .",
    "we then fixed these bag values , @xmath28 , for all baryons and the parameter @xmath27 and @xmath20 of the other baryons are obtained by reproducing their physical masses in free space and again enforcing the stability condition for their bags .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath27 and @xmath20 are displayed in table i for @xmath71 mev and for @xmath74 mev .",
    "note that for a fixed bag value , the equilibrium condition in free space results in an increase of the bag radius and a decrease of the parameters @xmath75 for the heavier baryons .",
    "next we fit the quark - meson coupling constants @xmath12 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the nucleon to obtain the correct saturation properties of the nuclear matter , @xmath78  mev at @xmath79  @xmath80 , @xmath81 mev , @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 .",
    "we have @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we take the standard values for the meson masses , @xmath87 mev , @xmath88 mev @xmath89 mev .    for the meson - hyperon coupling constants",
    "we have opted for three sets discussed in the literature : set a ) based on quark counting arguments we take @xmath90 as in @xcite ; set b ) according to @xcite we choose the hyperon coupling constants constrained by the binding of the @xmath38 hyperon in nuclear matter , hypernuclear levels and neutron star masses ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) and assume that the couplings to the @xmath93 and @xmath94 are equal to those of the @xmath38 hyperon ; set c ) based on the @xmath95 symmetry for the light quarks ( @xmath96 ) counting rule @xcite we take @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    in fig .",
    "[ nlwmvqmc ] we have plotted the eos obtained with the above parametrization of qmc and two choices of the hyperon couplings , set a ) and b ) together with the corresponding eos obtained with nlwm with cubic and quartic sigma terms ( @xmath99300 mev and @xmath100 m ) .",
    "although the nlwm - eos is harder at low densities , it becomes softer at higher energies after the onset of the hyperons .",
    "this fact has consequences on the behavior of the mixed phase and on the star properties .",
    "moreover , one can see that different choices of the meson - hyperon parameters have a greater influence on the nlwm , for which the curves separate at lower densities and become more distant one from the other at high densities , than in the qmc .",
    "the possible existence of quark matter in the core of neutron stars is an exciting possibility @xcite .",
    "densities of these stars are expected to be high enough to force the hadron constituents or nucleons to overlap , thereby yielding quark matter .",

    "@xmath64 is adjusted so that the matter is electrically neutral , i.e. @xmath111 .",
    "in this section we study the equation of state taking into consideration a cfl quark paired phase .",
    "we treat the quark matter as a fermi sea of free quarks with an additional contribution to the pressure arising from the formation of the cfl condensates .",
    "the cfl phase can be described with the help of the thermodynamical potential which reads @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 with @xmath115 set to zero , @xmath116 @xmath117 is a contribution from the goldstone bosons arising due to the chiral symmetry breaking in the cfl phase @xcite :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 @xmath120 is the negative of expression ( [ pressl ] ) , and the quark number densities are equal , i.e. , @xmath121 in the above expressions @xmath122 , the gap parameter , is taken to be 100 mev @xcite .    the electric charge density carried by the pion condensate",

    "we now consider the scenario of a mixed phase of hadronic and quark matter . in the mixed phase charge neutrality",
    "is imposed globally i.e. the quark and hadronic phases are not neutral separately but rather , the system prefers to rearrange itself so that @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the charge density of quark and hadron phase , @xmath130 is the volume fraction occupied by the quark phase , @xmath131 is the volume fraction occupied by the hadron phase and @xmath132 is the lepton charge density . as usual , the phase boundary of the coexistence region between the hadron and quark phase is determined by the gibbs criteria .",

    "the total baryon density in the mixed phase read : @xmath134 @xmath135    notice that in all equations above the quark phase ( qp ) can be either the uqm or the cfl phase .",
