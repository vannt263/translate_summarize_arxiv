    "liquid methanol is of fundamental interest in natural sciences and of significant importance in technical and industrial applications .",
    "the liquid phase of the simplest alcohol is widely studied , both experimentally and theoretically . among the alcohols , methanol is the closest analog to water .",
    "the characteristic hydroxyl group allows methanol to form hydrogen bonds that dominate the structural and dynamical behavior of the liquid phase . the methyl group does not participate in the hydrogen bonding and constitutes the distinction with water",
    "this difference is apparent in the microscopic structure of the liquid , with water having a tetrahedral - like coordination , whereas for methanol experiments and molecular simulation suggest a local structure consisting of chains , rings , or small clusters .",
    "the precise quantification of the microscopic structural and dynamical picture of liquid methanol has been a long - time subject in both experimental and molecular simulation studies .",
    "recently , a series of state - of - the - art studies have been reported . among these",
    "are the neutron diffraction ( nd ) experiments of refs .",
    "simulation studies include work based on empirical force - fields@xcite , mixed empirical and ab - initio interactions@xcite , and a full ab initio molecular dynamics study@xcite .",
    "the recent nd experiments have provided a detailed microscopic picture of the structure of liquid methanol , including the pair distribution functions among all atoms . yet , some of these atom - atom distribution functions are still subject to some uncertainty as they are obtained indirectly .",
    "molecular simulation provides a complementary approach to study the microscopic behavior of liquids .",
    "most molecular simulations studies of liquid methanol are based on empirical force fields potentials that are designed to reproduce a selection of experimental data .",
    "obviously , molecular simulations based on these potentials do not provide a picture completely independent from experiment .",
    "moreover , the reliability of the results at conditions that are significantly different from those where the potential was designed for , may be questionable .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) based molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation , such as the car - parrinello molecular dynamics method@xcite , where the interactions are calculated by accurate electronic structure calculations provides a route to overcome these limitations .",
    "this has been demonstrated in studies of liquid water@xcite and aqueous solvation@xcite .",
    "important advantages of dft - md over force - field md are that it intrinsically incorporates polarization , that it accounts for the intra - molecular motion and therefore allows for a direct comparison with spectroscopy of intra - molecular vibrations , and that it yields detailed information on the electronic properties , such as the energy levels of electronic states and the charge distribution . in a broader chemical perspective",
    "it is important to note that dft - md is capable of the study of chemical reactions in solution , where force - field md would fail completely as it can not account for the change in chemical bonding .    here",
    ", we report a dft - md study of liquid methanol that addresses the liquid structure , the inter- and intra - molecular dynamics , and the electronic charge distribution .",
    "electronic structure calculations are performed using the kohn - sham formulation of dft .",
    "we employed the gradient - corrected blyp functional@xcite .",
    "the choice for the blyp functional was guided by its good description of the structure and dynamics of water@xcite where hydrogen bonds are , as in liquid methanol , the dominant interactions .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that dft - blyp gives a proper description of solvation of methanol in water@xcite .",
    "the dft - based md simulations are performed with the car - parrinello method @xcite using the cpmd package@xcite .",
    "semi - local norm - conserving martins - troullier pseudopotentials@xcite are used to restrict the number of electronic states to those of the valence electrons .",
    "the pseudopotential cut - off radii were taken @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2  a.u , for h , o , and c , respectively .",
    "the electronic states are expanded in a plane - wave basis with a cut - off of @xmath3  ry yielding energies and geometries converged within @xmath4    and @xmath5  kj / mol , respectively .",
    "vibrational frequencies are converged within @xmath5  % , except for c - o and o - h stretch modes that are underestimated by @xmath6  % and @xmath7  % compared to the basis - set limit values@xcite .    to validate our computational approach we compared results for the gas - phase monomer and hydrogen - bonded dimer against state - of - the - art atomic - orbital dft calculations obtained with adf@xcite , and against the b3lyp and mp2 calculations of ref .",
    "the cpmd - blyp calculations were performed using a cubic box with an edge of 12.9   , with the interactions among the periodic images eliminated by a screening technique@xcite .",
    "results for geometry and complexation energy of the dimer are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer ] and table  [ tab : dimer ] .",
    "deviations among cpmd and adf are 1  kj / mol for the complexation energy , smaller than 0.01    for the intra - molecular bonds , and smaller than 0.02    for the hydrogen bond .",
    "this indicates a state - of - the - art accuracy for the numerical methods employed in cpmd .",
    "compared to the mp2 and b3lyp results , the blyp bond lengths are slightly longer , with deviations up to @xmath8 and @xmath9    for the intra- and inter - molecular bond lengths , respectively .",
    "differences among blyp , b3lyp and mp2 complexation energies are within acceptable limits , with the blyp energies smaller by 2 - 4  kj / mole .",
    "the deviations are similar to the comparison between blyp@xcite and mp2 for the water dimer and the water - methanol dimer@xcite .",
    "we obtained a zero - kelvin association enthalpy @xmath10 of @xmath11  kj / mol using the b3lyp zero - point energy of ref .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 13.2(4 ) kj / mol .",
    "the calculated hydrogen bond length ( @xmath12   , @xmath13   ) is in good agreement with the experimental values of @xmath14  and @xmath15    of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "current gradient corrected functionals such as blyp do not account for dispersion forces . for methanol this could be important as attraction to the methyl group is fully due to the dispersion force . to estimate the effect of the absence of the dispersion we computed the blyp binding energy of two dimer configurations that are sensitive to this : one with methyl groups approaching ( m - m ) and the other with the methyl and hydroxyl group approaching each other ( m - oh ) .",
    "state - of - the art mp2 calculations@xcite , that incorporate to a good approximation the dispersion force , serves as a reference .",
    "the dimer configurations were taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and chosen such that the carbon - carbon ( m - m dimer ) and carbon - oxygen ( m - oh dimer ) distances were close to the peak position of their atom - atom distribution function in the liquid state .",
    "m - oh dimer : geometry i with @xmath16   . both monomers in the dimer",
    "are kept fixed to their isolated geometries . ]",
    "the comparison yields for the m - m dimer values of @xmath17  kj / mol and @xmath18  kj / mol for blyp and mp2 , respectively . for the m - oh dimer these values are @xmath19  kj / mol and @xmath20  kj / mol , respectively .",
    "the too repulsive nature of the blyp interaction is consistent with dft calculations of dispersion dominated systems@xcite .",
    "however , although by far not insignificant , the magnitude of the deviation is much smaller than the hydrogen - bond interaction and of the same order of magnitude as the error in the latter . it can therefore be argued that for a study of liquid methanol on the accuracy level of blyp , neglecting the dispersion interaction is acceptable .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that for the gas - phase monomer cpmd - blyp vibrational frequencies are in excellent agreement with adf results and , compared to experiment , underestimate allmost all modes by @xmath21 , a known feature of the blyp functional .",
    "overall , we conclude that our level theory is satisfactory in comparison with experimental and other theoretical gas - phase data .",
    "liquid methanol was modeled by 32 molecules in a periodic cubic box with an edge of 12.9  , reproducing the experimental density of 0.791  g/@xmath22 at 293  k@xcite .",
    "the temperature was fixed at 293 k using the nos - hoover thermostat @xcite . the fictitious mass associated with the plane - wave coefficients",
    "is chosen at 900 a.u . , which allowed for a time step in the numerical integration of the equations - of - motion of 0.145  fs .",
    "the system was equilibrated for 1 ps from an initial configuration obtained from a force - field simulation .",
    "subsequently , we gathered statistical averages from a 6 ps trajectory .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : liq - struct ] we have plotted the most characteristic atom - atom radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) , i.e. the hydrogen bonding o - o , o - h@xmath23 , and h@xmath24-h@xmath23 rdf and the c - o rdf . for comparison we also plotted results of recent nd results@xcite and the peak positions obtained using haugney s empirical potential@xcite , the latter being considered one of the most accurate empirical force fields to date .",
    "the pronounced structure in the first three rdfs are a clear indication of the presence of hydrogen bonds .",
    "comparison with the experimental data shows that the positions of the first peaks match within the statistical error for the o - o and o - h@xmath23 rdfs and is slightly smaller ( @xmath25   ) for the h@xmath24-h@xmath24 rdf .",
    "the height of the first peak is in good agreement for the o - h@xmath23 and h@xmath24-h@xmath24 rdfs , that both can be determined accurately from the nd data .",
    "however , the o - o rdf shows a calculated first peak height that is significantly lower than the experimental result .",
    "given the small system of 32 molecules in our simulation , the discrepancy could well be a system - size effect .",
    "on the other hand , the indirect way by which the the o - o rdf is extracted from nd data could yield an overestimate of the o - o correlation .",
    "comparison with force field results@xcite , that yield significant higher peak values for the o - o and o - h@xmath23 rdfs , suggests that the haugney potential overestimates the hydrogen bonding structure in the liquid , in line with the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the number of h - bonds as calculated by integrating the o - h@xmath23 and o - o rdfs up to the first minimum , and using the geometrical criterion of ref .",
    "@xcite , yields values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experimental nd results of ref .",
    "@xcite yielding @xmath29 and @xmath26 obtained by integrating the o - h@xmath23 and o - o rdfs . applying the geometrical criterion to the haugney force - field simulation@xcite",
    "yields a slightly higher value of @xmath26 .",
    "the hydrogen bonding in the liquid phase is accompanied by an elongation of the oh@xmath23 bond of @xmath30   .",
    "a direct comparison with the experimental results for this change in the geometry of the methanol molecule is rather difficult due to the large spread in the reported values .",
    "however , similar change in the geometry is observed in the dft - md study of liquid methanol reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and in _ ab initio _ studies of small methanol clusters@xcite .",
    "the calculated c - o rdf is in reasonable agreement with the nd results , with the overall shape well reproduced but the first peak clearly less pronounced than in the nd result .",
    "this is consistent with the , in the previous section found , underestimation of the blyp binding energy of the m - o dimer with a c - o distance at the rdf peak position .",
    "this is due to the absence of the dispersion interaction in blyp .",
    "however , the absence of the dispersion interaction clearly does not lead to a completely distorted c - o positional correlation .",
    "the comparison of the calculated c - c rdf with the nd result ( not plotted ) is very similar .",
    "the time scale of the present simulation ( 6 ps ) allows for an analysis of the short - time dynamics of liquid methanol .",
    "figure  [ fig : liq - spectrum ] shows the power spectrum of the velocity auto correlation function ( vacf ) of the hydroxyl hydrogen . for comparison",
    "we have also plotted the calculated 200  k monomer spectrum of ref .",
    "the three distinct peaks correspond to the oh stretch ( 3100  @xmath31 ) , c - o - h bend ( 1600  @xmath31 ) , and the co stretch ( 1000  @xmath31 ) .",
    "the broad feature below 1000  @xmath31 indicates the librational - translational ( 500  @xmath31 ) modes of the methanol molecules . compared to the gas phase ,",
    "the liquid oh stretch mode has red - shifted by approximately 200 @xmath31 and broadened considerably . on the other hand ,",
    "the c - o - h bending is blue - shifted by approximately 70 @xmath31 .",
    "the observed shifts and broadening are characteristic for hydrogen bonded liquids and also observed in the spectrum of water or hydrated methanol .",
    "the calculated shifts compare reasonably well with experimental infrared spectra@xcite that yield values of @xmath32354 @xmath31 and + 78 @xmath31 for the o - h stretch and c - o - h bend .",
    "the calculated positions and shifts of the modes match within statistical errors with those of methanol in aqueous solution@xcite determined using the same computational approach .",
    "this indicates that the intra - molecular dynamics of methanol is affected in a similar way by an aqueous environment and a methanol environment .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath33 is a key measure of the collective dynamics . in view of the limited length of the calculated trajectory we can only provide a rough estimate . from the mean square displacement of the oxygen atoms we obtained @xmath34 , in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of @xmath35 @xcite .      as the electronic structure is an intrinsic part of a cpmd simulation ,",
    "detailed information on the electronic charge distribution is obtained . to quantify the charge distribution we used the method of maximally localized wannier functions that transforms the kohn - sham orbitals into wannier functions whose centers ( wfc )",
    "can be assigned with a chemical meaning such as being associated with an electron bonding- or lone - pair ( lp)@xcite .",
    "we calculated the positions of the wfcs for the monomer , the dimer , and 6 independent configurations of the liquid simulation .",
    "table  [ tab : charges ] lists the ( average ) distances of the wfcs associated with the oxygen electrons .",
    "most notably is the small but significant shift of @xmath36    for the oh bond wfc towards the oxygen atom when going from the monomer to the liquid . at the same time ,",
    "one of the lp wfcs shifts away from the oxygen by @xmath37 .",
    "these changes should be considered a manifestation of the hydrogen bonding and the induced polarization among the dipolar methanol molecules in the liquid state .    to quantify the change in the charge distribution in a single number we calculated the molecular dipole moment assuming the electronic charge to be distributed as point charges located on the wfcs .",
    "for liquid water it has been shown that such a partitioning of the charges over the molecules yields a unique assignment of the wfcs over distinct molecules@xcite . from table  [",
    "tab : dipole ] , that lists the values for the monomer , dimer , and liquid , we observe a significant enhancement of the dipole moment going from the monomer via the dimer to the liquid .",
    "a comparable liquid - state value of 2.39  d has been observed in a coupled empirical and ab initio mp2 study@xcite .",
    "note that the value of the dipole moment is somewhat larger than in the haugney@xcite ( 2.33  d ) or amber@xcite ( 2.2  d ) force field .",
    "a second important feature of the electronic charge distribution in the liquid is its fluctuating character due to the thermally driven configurational changes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : liq - dipole ] we have plotted the calculated distribution of the dipole moments in the liquid phase .",
    "it shows that there is a significant variation ranging from 1.7  d to 3.5  d.",
    "we have demonstrated that _ ab initio _",
    "md is a valuable approach to study the structural , dynamical , and electronic properties of liquid methanol .",
    "the calculated pair distribution functions involving the hydroxyl hydrogens correlate well with recent state - of - the - art neutron diffraction experiments of soper and co - workers .",
    "it confirms their finding that one of the benchmark empirical potentials overestimates the hydrogen bonding structure .",
    "the calculated oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function shows significantly less structure than the experimental neutron diffraction results .",
    "currently we are studying a larger simulation sample to see whether this is due to the small system size in the present calculation .",
    "it could also be a result from an inaccuracy in the experimental result that is obtained in an indirect way .",
    "results for the dimer binding energies and the oxygen - carbon rdf suggest that the absence of the dispersion interaction is notable but has no major impact . comparing the vibrational spectra of the liquid phase against that of the gas phase monomer shows a significant red shift of the o - h stretch accompanied by a smaller blue shift of the c - o - h bend mode , in reasonable agreement with experimental observations with the o - h shift somewhat underestimated in our calculation .",
    "we quantified the electronic charge distribution using a wannier function decomposition .",
    "a small but measurable shift of the positions of the wannier function centers when going from the gas - phase to the liquid is accompanied by a substantial enhancement of the dipole moment .",
    "moreover we have found that in the liquid the dipole moment fluctuates significantly with variations up to half the average magnitude .",
    "the latter suggest that the assumption made in empirical potentials using a fixed dipole moment is a strong simplification .",
    "the present results may be considered valuable data for improvement of empirical potentials for the study of liquid methanol .",
