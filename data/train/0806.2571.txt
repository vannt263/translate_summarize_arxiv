    "the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) provides an excellent quantitative description of complete sets of elastic proton scattering observables from various spin - saturated spherical nuclei at incident energies ranging from 200 to 400  mev @xcite .",
    "the latter represents the theoretical framework for generating complex microscopic optical potentials for solving the elastic scattering dirac equation .",
    "the reliability of the ria has also been demonstrated by the fact that , for the above energies , predictions of elastic proton scattering observables are very similar to the corresponding results based on the highly successful global dirac phenomenological optical potentials , which have been calibrated to provide excellent quantitative predictions of elastic proton scattering observables from stable nuclei ranging from @xmath3c to @xmath0pb and for incident energies between 20 and 1040  mev @xcite .    the melbourne group have already developed a highly predictive microscopic schrdinger model for describing elastic scattering at energies between 20 and 800  mev @xcite . here , however , we focus on the ria which is based on the relativistic dirac equation , and is more attractive in the sense that the microscopic scalar and vector optical potentials  and consequently the corresponding schrdinger - equivalent central and spin - orbit optical potentials @xcite are directly related to the lorentz properties of the mesons mediating the strong nuclear force , a connection lacking in nonrelativistic models .",
    "recently we developed an energy - dependent lorentz covariant parameterization of the on - shell nn scattering matrix at incident laboratory kinetic energies ranging from 40 to 300  mev @xcite . in this paper , we employ the latter meson - exchange model to generate relativistic microscopic scalar and vector folding optical potentials in order to systematically study the predictive power of the ria for describing elastic proton - nucleus scattering observables at energies lower than 200  mev . at these low energies of interest ,",
    "multiple scattering effects @xcite , medium modifications of the nn interaction @xcite , and pauli blocking @xcite contributions become increasingly important , and hence the validity of the ria needs to be investigated at these low energies .    in sec .",

    "although pb systematically improves the ria predictions at lower energies , these corrections do not provide a quantitative description of complete sets of observables , and hence it is clear that other effects also begin to play an increasingly significant role as the energy is lowered .",
    "the question now arises as to whether one can incorporate additional corrections so as to consistently improve these low energy results within the framework of the ria .",
    "various authors @xcite have stressed that importance of nuclear medium modifications to the nn interaction at lower energies .",
    "in particular , a number of theoretical models @xcite predict density - dependent corrections to meson - nucleon coupling constants as well as nucleon- and meson - masses in normal nuclear matter . we now adopt a phenomenological approach to investigate to what extent",
    "the renormalization of certain meson - nucleon coupling constants can provide a systematic improvement of the data at 65  mev . since scalar and vector ria optical potentials are dominated by contributions from @xmath1- and @xmath2-meson exchange to the nn scattering amplitudes , we vary the values of the real @xmath1n and @xmath2n coupling constants , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , so as to provide the best consistent description of elastic proton - nucleus scattering .",

    "microscopic scalar and vector optical potentials are generated by folding our recently developed relativistic meson - exchange model of the nn scattering matrix with appropriate lorentz densities arising from the pk1 lagrangian density .",
    "we have established that phenomenological pauli blocking effects and density - dependent corrections to the @xmath1n and @xmath2n meson - nucleon coupling constants modify the ria microscopic scalar and vector optical potentials so as to provide a consistent and quantitative description of all elastic scattering observables ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) at energies ranging from 30 to 200  mev . in particular , the effect of pb becomes more significant at energies lower than 200  mev , whereas phenomenological density - dependent corrections to the nn interaction _ also _ play an increasingly important role at energies lower than 100  mev . note that although our initial study has been of a phenomenological nature , our results clearly indicate the importance of including pb and density - dependent corrections to the microscopic ria model for providing consistent and quantitative predictions of all of the above - mentioned scattering observables at energies lower than 200  mev .",
    "indeed the latter conclusion is consistent with corresponding nonrelativistic microscopic studies @xcite .",
    "guided by our phenomenological result , the next phase will be to incorporate the pb and density - dependent corrections within the context of microscopic relativistic dynamical models in a manner similar to the successful nonrelativistic @xmath71-folding model developed by the melbourne group @xcite .    in closing , we emphasize that not only is the ria a highly predictive model , but it also provides a microscopic meson - exchange picture for understanding the behavior of the successful global dirac optical potentials .",
    "another attractive feature of the ria is the consistent application of the relativistic meson - exchange nn scattering matrix for generating microscopic folding optical potentials  required for calculating the scattering wave functions necessary for evaluating relativistic transition matrix elements  and also for describing the driving nn reaction mechanism in relativistic distorted wave models of nucleon - induced reactions .",
    "one of the most useful applications envisaged for the ria will be to generate microscopic optical potentials for studying elastic and inelastic scattering of nucleons from unstable neutron- and proton - rich nuclei for which global optical potentials do not exist .",
    "indeed , existing global dirac optical potentials have been constrained to reproduce elastic proton scattering from stable nuclei @xcite , and hence there is no reason to believe that these potentials can be reliably extrapolated for studies of exotic nuclei . on the other hand , one can readily extend the ria folding procedure to calculate microscopic optical potentials for exotic nuclei .",
    "the latter can easily be realized due to the current availability of suitable relativistic meson - exchange models @xcite as well sophisticated relativistic mean field nuclear structure models for unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "future work will focus on studying elastic proton scattering from exotic nuclei .",

    "<S> we present the first study to examine the validity of the relativistic impulse approximation ( ria ) for describing elastic proton - nucleus scattering at incident laboratory kinetic energies lower than 200  mev . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we choose a @xmath0pb target , which is a spin - saturated spherical nucleus for which reliable nuclear structure models exist . </S>",
    "<S> microscopic scalar and vector optical potentials are generated by folding invariant scalar and vector scattering nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) amplitudes , based on our recently developed relativistic meson - exchange model , with lorentz scalar and vector densities resulting from the accurately calibrated pk1 relativistic mean field model of nuclear structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that phenomenological pauli blocking ( pb ) effects and density - dependent corrections to @xmath1n and @xmath2n meson - nucleon coupling constants modify the ria microscopic scalar and vector optical potentials so as to provide a consistent and quantitative description of all elastic scattering observables , namely total reaction cross sections , differential cross sections , analyzing powers and spin rotation functions . in particular , the effect of pb becomes more significant at energies lower than 200  mev , whereas phenomenological density - dependent corrections to the nn interaction _ also _ play an increasingly important role at energies lower than 100  mev . </S>"
