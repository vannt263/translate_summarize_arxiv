    ".8 cm the observation of the @xmath2-meson by the cdf collaboration in the channel @xmath3 , with ground state mass @xmath4 gev , and lifetime @xmath5@xmath6 ps [ 1 ] , has stimulated up the investigation of the properties of @xmath2-mesons theoretically , and experimentally on a new footing .",
    "the particular interest of this observation is related to the fact that , the meson ground - state with @xmath7 can decay only weakly , thus providing the rather unique opportunity of investigating weak decays in a heavy quarkonium system . moreover , studying this meson could offer an unique probe to check the perturbative qcd predictions more precisely , and one can get essential new information about the confinement scale inside hadrons . the theoretical study of the pure - leptonic decays of @xmath2-meson , such as @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) can be used to determine the leptonic decay constant @xmath10 [ 2 ] , as well as the fundamental parameters in the standard model ( sm ) , such as the cabibbo- kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements which are poorly known at present .",
    "nevertheless , the well - known  helicity suppression  effect make an experimental difficulty in the measurement of purely leptonic decays of @xmath2 . although , the @xmath11 channel is free of the helicity suppression , the observation of this decay is experimentally difficult due to the efficiency problem for detecting the @xmath12 lepton .",
    "recently , the radiative leptonic @xmath13 decays ( @xmath9 ) , received considerable attention as a testing ground of sm and  new physics ",
    ", where no helicity suppression exists any more [ 3 - 5 ] .    among various radiative",
    "leptonic decays , the @xmath14 decay provokes special interest , since the sm predictions has been exploited to establish a bound on the branching ratio of the above mentioned decay of order @xmath15 [ 5,6 ] , and therefore can be potentially measurable in the up coming lhc b - factories , where the number of @xmath2-mesons that will be produced are estimated to be @xmath16 [ 7,8 ]",
    ". this will provide an alternative way to determine the decay constant @xmath10 and the ckm matrix elements .",
    "the decay @xmath14 receive two types of contributions : internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) , and structure - dependent ( sd ) parts .",
    "the ib contributions are still helicity suppressed , while the sd ones contain the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath17 but they are free of helicity suppression . therefore , the radiative decay rates of @xmath13 could have an enhancement with respect to the purely leptonic modes of @xmath8 due to the sd contributions , thus it enable to establish `` new physics '' beyond the standard model .    in this work , we will study the radiative leptonic @xmath14 decay in the framework of the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) [ 9 - 11 ] at large @xmath1 . the so - called model i and model ii are considered , which are differ only in the couplings of the charged higgs bosons to fermions .",
    "subsequently , this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the theoretical formalism relevance for the @xmath14 decay in 2hdm is presented .",
    "section 3 , is devoted to the numerical analysis and the discussion of the results .",
    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the decay @xmath14 can be studied to a very good approximation in terms of four - fermion interactions .",
    "the effective hamiltonian relevant to the process @xmath11 is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fermi constant , @xmath20 is the ckm mixing element , @xmath21 is a qcd corrected factor , which is equal @xmath22 .",
    "however , in the next discussion we will put @xmath23    the emission of a real photon in leptonic decays of heavy mesons @xmath14 can proceed via the two mechanisms mentioned in sec . i. for the ib amplitude , the charged @xmath2-meson emits leptons via the axial - vector current , and the photon is radiated from the external charged particles . on the other hand",
    "the sd amplitude is governed by the vector and axial vector form factors , in which the photon is emitted from intermediate states .",
    "gauge invariance leaves only two form factors @xmath24 undetermined in the sd part .",
    "the possible diagrams for this two mechanisms are shown in fig .",
    "1 . following this framework , the general form of the gauge invariant amplitude corresponding to fig .",
    "1 can be written as [ 6 ] : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the contributions of  inner bremsstrahlung ",
