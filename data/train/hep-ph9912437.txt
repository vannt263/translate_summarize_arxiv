    "the birefringence of @xmath0-quanta with energies @xmath1 gev propagating in single crystals was predicted in @xcite .",
    "the main process by which @xmath0-quanta are absorbed in single crystals is the electron - positron pair production @xcite .",
    "the cross section of the process depends on the direction of linear polarization of the @xmath0-quanta relative to the crystallographic planes . as a result of interaction with the electric field of the single crystal , a monochromatic , linearly polarized",
    "beam of @xmath0-quanta comprises two electromagnetic waves with different refractive indices , so that linear polarization is transformed into circular polarization or vice versa .",
    "this polarization phenomenon should be observed for symmetric orientations of single crystals with respect to the direction of motion of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "semilar effects for the production or analysis of polarized @xmath0-quanta have been discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic medium is determined as medium , whose optical properties can be described using a symmetric permittivity tensor@xcite .",
    "the single crystals serve as examples of the similar medium for @xmath0- quanta with energies in tens gev and more .",
    "the general case of the propagation of high energy @xmath0-quanta in the anisotropic medium was considered in @xcite .",
    "this process was investigated in detail for propagation in a dichromatic laser wave , which is the simplest sample of the anisotropic medium of general type .",
    "( the dichromatic wave is a superposition of the two linearly polarized laser waves with different frequencies moving in the same direction and , broadly speaking , nonzero angle between directions of polarization of these waves . )",
    "the cited paper shows that in the general case the unpolarized beam of @xmath0-quanta obtains some degree of circular polarization ( in contrast to the case in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine the propagation of high energy @xmath0-quanta in single crystals oriented in some regions of coherent @xmath2-pair production @xcite .",
    "we show that single crystals are sensitive to the circular polarization of propagating @xmath0-quanta .",
    "the permittivity tensor in single crystals oriented in the regions corresponding to coherent @xmath2-pair production was obtained with the help of dispersion relations in @xcite .",
    "the components of this tensor are complex values and have the following form : @xmath3 ( the process is determined by the transverse part of the tensor ) .",
    "it is the symmetrical tensor ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) with components depending on the energy of @xmath0-quanta and two orientation angles of the single crystal with respect to the direction of @xmath0-beam motion .",
    "it is well - known that in the general case the symmetric complex tensor is not reduced to principal axes ( i.e. , there does not exist a coordinate system in which the tensors @xmath5 and @xmath6 are both diagonal ) .",
    "it is really , this situation is realized in single crystals at orientations when some `` strong '' planes act together on propagating @xmath0-quanta @xcite .",
    "obviously , these orientations take a place , when a beam of @xmath0-quanta move under relatively small angles with respect to one of crystallographic axes . knowing the permittivity tensor @xmath7",
    ", one can find the refractive indices of @xmath0-quanta @xcite @xmath8 consequently , a beam of @xmath0-quanta propagates in the single crystals as a superposition of two electromagnetic waves , which have different refractive indices in general .",
    "one can describe the polarization state either ( of the two ) wave by the use of the stokes parameters @xmath9 ( @xmath10-values correspond to one wave and @xmath11 to another ) .",
    "these parameters are determined by the following relations@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ratio of components of electric induction vector @xmath14 in the coordinate system , in which one axis is parallel to the wave vector of @xmath0-quanta : @xmath15 we call attention to relation : @xmath16 ( i.e. , waves have the same value of circular polarization ) .",
    "these waves , described here , are the eigenfunctions of problem , and they named as normal electromagnetic waves @xcite . in general these waves are elliptically polarized at propagation of @xmath0-quanta in single crystals @xcite .    representing the beam of @xmath0-quanta by a superposition of two normal electromagnetic waves with previously determined refractive indices and polarization characteristic ,",
    "we obtain relations describing the variation of the intensity and stokes parameters of the @xmath0-quanta propagating in the single crystal @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the intensity and stokes parameters of @xmath0-quanta on the single crystal thickness equal to x. besides , we assume that @xmath19 .",
    "the partial intensities @xmath20 have the following form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the frequency of @xmath0-quanta and @xmath23 is the speed of light .",
    "one can understand the physical meaning of @xmath24-values , if we write the matrix @xmath25 in the component - wise form , where @xmath26 is a superposition of the normal waves .",
    "the initial partial intensities are defined from relations : @xmath27    for small thickness one can obtain the following relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total cross section @xcite of @xmath2-pair production by @xmath0-quanta with the initial @xmath30-stokes parameters and n is the number of atoms per unit volume .",
    "notice that the dependence on @xmath31 appears only at @xmath32-terms ( and higher ) in the expansion ( if @xmath33 ) .",
    "one can see that the initially unpolarized beam of @xmath0-quanta ( @xmath34 ) obtains some degree of linear and circular polarization at propagation in the single crystal .",
    "however , this beam gets the circular polarization only in the case when @xmath33 ( i.e. , normal waves are elliptically polarized ) .",
    "taking into account eq.(9 ) , one can expect that the circular polarization may be appreciable only on a significant thickness .",
    "the value of intensity of @xmath0-quanta on any thickness x depends on their initial polarization .",
    "it is convenient to define the following value of asymmetry : @xmath35 where the matrix @xmath36 .",
    "it easy to see that the @xmath37-asymmetry is equal to the relative variation of intensity between the two cases ; in one case the @xmath0-quanta is initially unpolarized , and , in second case the @xmath0-quanta have the polarization , which described by the matrix p. any asymmetry @xmath37 can be expressed with the use of the three basic asymmetries @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the following form : @xmath40 the basic asymmetries @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined correspondingly by the next p - matrices : ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) , ( 0,0,1 ) .",
    "besides , the @xmath44-parameters connect with the corresponding stokes parameters @xmath45 ( i=1 - 3 ) for initially unpolarized @xmath0-quanta on the same thickness by the following relations @xmath46 note that the positive quantity of @xmath47 corresponds to the right circular polarization .",
    "we have considered the process of 50-gev @xmath0-quanta propagation in the silicon single crystal at room temperature .",
    "the case , when the beam of @xmath0-quanta move under small angle ( at some milliradians ) with respect to @xmath48 axis of the single crystal , was selected for computations . in calculations",
    "the moliere atomic form factor was employed @xcite .",
    "one can determine the direction of @xmath0-quanta motion with the use of angle @xmath49 with respect to @xmath48-axis and the azimuth angle @xmath50 around of this axis ( @xmath51 when the momentum of @xmath0-quanta lies in the @xmath52 plane ) .",
    "however , another angles are more convenient to use @xmath53 .",
    "fig.1 illustrates the calculations of the @xmath54-value as a function of the two angles @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the numbers on fig.1 show the degree of circular polarization of normal waves .",
    "the number 0 corresponds to @xmath54-values from 0 to 0.1 , number 1 corresponds to ones from 0.1 to 0.2 and so on .",
    "one can see that the widths of both orientation angles where @xmath57 is about 0.3 - 0.4 mrad .",
    "the same picture takes a place also at different energies of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "however , in this case the angles of orientation depend inversely proportional on the energy .",
    "fig.2 illustrates the calculations of the absolute values of basic asymmetry parameters for the two orientations of the single crystal as a function of the thickness @xmath58 .",
    "one can see that @xmath59 if thickness @xmath60 cm .",
    "note that intensity of initially unpolarized @xmath0-quanta is equal to 0.0082 at x=25 cm ( 0.000078 at x=50 cm ) for the first orientation ( solid lines ) and correspondingly 0.0058 ( 0.000034 ) for the second orientation ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the @xmath54-values are equal to 0.88 and 0.48 for these orientations .",
    "note , we use in calculations the cartesian coordinate system with one axis along the momentum of @xmath0-quanta and with the other two axes lying in the @xmath52 and @xmath61 crystallographic planes .",
    "the polarization state of propagating @xmath0-beam become same as the state of one normal wave begining from some thickness .",
    "however , it takes a place at the very large values of @xmath62 cm ( for curves on fig.2 ) , and it is out of significance to the practicality .",
    "the reason is the small value of @xmath63 for high circular polarizations of normal waves ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of single crystals to the circular polarization can be used for its measurements . in the general case",
    "initial beam of @xmath0-quanta has the linear and circular polarizations . as follows from eq.(22 ) two measurements of asymmetry @xmath65 make possible determination of the circular polarization of @xmath0-quanta .",
    "let @xmath66 be the measured asymmetry in the first measurement .",
    "in the second measurement , it needs to change the direction of linear polarization on @xmath67 with respect to the axis of single crystal ( the @xmath68 are the same in both cases ) .",
    "it is possible to make by rotating of the single crystal around the momentum of @xmath0-quanta . as a result",
    "we get @xmath69 one can rewrite this equation in the following form : @xmath70 knowing the @xmath71 and @xmath42-values , one can determine the circular polarization of @xmath0-quanta if the relative intensities @xmath72 were found experimentally .",
    "we have considered the general case of propagation of @xmath0-quanta in single crystals .",
    "it was shown that there exist some regions of orientations where single crystals are sensitive to circular polarization of @xmath0-beam , and the possibility of its measurements is discussed .",
    "note that there are few in number of processes in the condensed medium sensitive to the circular polarization of @xmath0-quanta with energies in tens gev .",
