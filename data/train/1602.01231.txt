    "low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is an attractive candidate of the physics beyond the standard model even though the recent lhc experiment is imposing stringent constraints on the mass scale of superparticles .",
    "importantly , there is still a possibility that there exist superparticles with their masses below tev scale . in particular , a scalar top - quark ( stop ) with the mass of @xmath7 is still allowed if there exists a neutralino whose mass is just below that of the stop mass ; in such a case , even if the stop is produced at the lhc experiments , its decay products are too soft to be observed so that it can evade the detection at the lhc .",
    "if there exists stop with its mass of @xmath8 , it will become an important target of future collider experiments .",
    "if the signal of the stop is discovered at the lhc , the lhc and the international @xmath0 linear collider ( ilc ) may play important role to study its basic properties ( like the mass and left - right mixing angle ) .",
    "it is , however , also important to study the strength of the stop - stop - higgs coupling because the higgs mass in the supersymmetric model is sensitive to it ; measurement of the stop - stop - higgs coupling is crucial to understand the origin of the higgs mass in supersymmetric model .",
    "it motivates the study of the stop - stop bound state ( so - called stoponium which is denoted as @xmath9 in this paper ) because decay rate of the stoponium is crucially depends on such a coupling .",
    "if we observe the process of @xmath10 , we can acquire information about the stop - stop - higgs coupling .",
    "photon - photon colliders may be useful to perform such a study  @xcite .",
    "a photon - photon collider is one of the options of the ilc and can be realized by converting high - energy electron ( or positron ) beam of the ilc to the backscattered high - energy photon .",
    "it has been intensively discussed that the photon - photon collider can be used to study the properties of higgs and other scalar particles  @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of photon - photon colliders is that the single production of some scalar particles ( including the higgs boson ) is possible so that the kinematical reach is close to the total center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy ; this is a big contrast to other colliders with @xmath11 and @xmath0 collision .",
    "the single production of the stoponium bound state is also possible with the photon - photon collision , and hence it is interesting to consider the stoponium study at the photon - photon collider .    in this paper , we investigate how and how well we can study the property of the stoponium at the photon - photon collider , paying particular attention to the process of @xmath12 .",
    "we calculate the cross section of the stoponium production process at the photon - photon collider .",
    "we also estimate backgrounds , and discuss the possibility of observing the stoponium production process at the photon - photon collider .",
    "implication of the cross section measurement of the stoponium di - higgs decay mode for the mssm stop sector is also discussed .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the theoretical framework of the stoponium and its production cross section and decay widths at the photon - photon collider .",
    "the detectability of the stoponium in the di - higgs decay mode is investigated in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implication of the cross section measurement of the stoponium production and di - higgs decay for the mssm stop sector .",
    "then we provide our summary in section 5 .",
    "let us first summarize the framework of our analysis .",

    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are @xmath21 indices , while the color indices are omitted for simplicity .",
    "the relevant part of the soft susy breaking terms is @xmath22 where `` tilde '' is used for superpartners .    neglecting the effects of flavor mixing ,",
    "the stop mass terms are expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the top - quark mass , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the weinberg angle , @xmath29 the @xmath30-boson mass , and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 parameters are taken to be real .",
    "the mass eigenstates are given by the linear combination of the left- and right - handed stops ; we define the mixing angle @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are lighter and heavier mass eigenstates with the masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .    before closing this subsection",
    ", we comment on the lightest mssm higgs boson mass .",
    "the lightest higgs mass is sensitive to the masses of stops as well as to the @xmath32 parameter through radiative corrections . with the stop masses being fixed",
    ", the lightest higgs mass becomes equal to the observed higgs mass ( which is taken to be @xmath40 throughout our study ) for four different values of @xmath32 ; two of them are positive and others are negative .",
    "we call these as positive - large , positive - small , negative - large , and negative - small solutions of @xmath32 , where large and small solutions correspond to those with large and small values of @xmath41 .      due to the strong interaction ,",
    "a stop and an anti - stop can form a bound state , called stoponium . in this analysis , we concentrate on the case where the decay rate of a stop is negligibly small . because we are interested in the collider study of the stoponium , we concentrate on the bound state of the lighter stop .",
    "the lowest bound state , @xmath42 , has the quantum number of @xmath43 , and hence its resonance production does not occur at @xmath0 colliders . at photon - photon colliders , on the contrary ,",
