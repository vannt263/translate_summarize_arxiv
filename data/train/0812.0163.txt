    "the study of the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs is one of the most active areas of current galactic research .",
    "the identification of samples of such objects allows both the low mass / substellar luminosity and mass functions to be constrained .",
    "these can in turn be used to constain models of star and brown dwarf formation .",
    "additionally such samples may produce interesting single or multiple objects , whose spectroscopic properties could inform atmospheric models for brown dwarfs and giant planets .    until relatively recently the majority of proper motion surveys have concentrated on optical data . among the first to use proper motion as a tool to select faint , nearby populations was luyten .",
    "his work using photographic plates culminated in two large scale catalogues of high proper motion stars , the luyten half arcsecond catalogue ( lhs - luyten 1979a ) and the new luyten two - tenths catalogue ( nltt - luyten 1979b ) . since that time much work has gone into identifying objects",
    "luyten missed and filling in areas of poor coverage .",
    "the majority of recent wide - field proper motion surveys have used digitised photographic plate data , mostly in optical filters .",
    "such surveys include lepine & shara ( 2008 ) , hambly et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , pokorny et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and finch et al .",
    "infrared proper motion surveys are an ideal instrument for producing samples of low mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "these objects are cool @xmath0 and hence are intrinsically faint and red . as a result",
    "they are most easily detected in the infrared .",
    "the first infrared proper motion survey was conducted by deacon , hambly & cooke ( 2005 ) , this used supercosmos ( hambly et al . 2001 ) scans of ukst @xmath1 plates along with data from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass - skrutskie et al . , 2006 ) to produce a sample of 144 low mass stars and brown dwarfs with proper motions above half an arcsecond per year . in the later paper ( deacon & hambly 2007 ) the sample was expanded to more than 7000 objects with the minimum proper motion limit reduced to 0.1/yr .",
    "recently looper et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used available overlap areas in the 2mass data to detect two new l dwarfs using an infrared proper motion survey .",
    "metchev et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used 2mass data along with those from the partially infrared sloan digital sky survey ( adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) to identify two new t dwarfs and 22 new l dwarfs .",
    "recent large - scale infrared surveys such as the deep near infrared survey ( denis - epchtein et al . , 1997 ) ) and 2mass took place at the end of the last decade and the start of this one .",
    "they produced ccd quality infrared data over tens of thousands of square degrees to depths of 16.5 and 15.8 respectively in the @xmath2 band .",
    "both surveys have led to large samples of late type objects being identified and classified ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999 , burgasser et al .",
    "2002 , delfosse et al .",
    "the generation of infrared surveys following denis and 2mass is led by the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss - lawrence et al .",
    "this suite of surveys using wfcam ( casali et al . 2007 ) on the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) provides both large scale surveys for studies of galactic and extragalactic populations and deep pencil - beam surveys to examine the population of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the two surveys of the most interest to the study of low mass stars and brown dwarfs are the large area survey ( las ) and the galactic clusters survey ( gcs ) .",
    "the las will have a final area of 4000 square degrees , will be in four passbands ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) to a depth of @xmath2=19.6 and will also provide a second @xmath2 band epoch for proper motion measurements .",
    "it covers an area away from the galactic plane and is intended for the study of high redshift quasars and cool dwarf / subdwarfs in the field .",
    "this survey has already produced interesting results , both in terms of individual cool objects ( warren et al .",
    "2007 ) and the population of low mass objects ( pinfield et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the gcs concentrates on ten star forming regions and open clusters .",
    "in addition to the four colours used in the las , @xmath6 band data is available and a second @xmath5 epoch will provide proper motion data for the clusters .",
    "so far studies such as lodieu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and lodieu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have used the data released to produce mass functions for upper sco and the pleiades respectively .",
    "the gcs can be used also for the study of objects lying in the foreground of the target clusters ( lodieu et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the ukidss data is released through the wfcam science archive ( wsa - hambly et al .",
    "2008 ) and is available to all european southern observatories ( eso ) members .",
    "the current release is data release 4 ( dr4 ) .",
    "additionally astronomers from non - eso countries can access the data after an 18 month delay .",
    "the soon to be operational visual and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista - emerson et al .",
    "2004 ) will provide an even faster infrared surveying capability than wfcam .",
    "it will cover the whole southern hemisphere in two bands ( @xmath2 and @xmath5 ) including several thousand square degrees with additional @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 band photometry .",
    "( 75,120 )    our method for selecting candidate ultracool dwarfs is almost identical to that used in deacon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and deacon & hambly ( 2007 ) .",
    "the first selection process is to identify ukidss objects with counterparts in 2mass within a distance of roughly 4 - 5@xmath7 ( where @xmath7 is the positional error between the surveys ) . clearly to be able to carry out this selection we must first identify the typical positional errors between the surveys",
    "this was done by comparing the positions of objects between the two surveys and calculating the standard deviation between the two while removing non - gaussian outliers .",
    "a plot of the errors vs. @xmath2 band magnitude is shown in figure  [ errplot ] .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that above the saturation limit ( @xmath2=10.5 ) the positional errors are of the order of 0.1 arcseconds in each axis .",
    "hence a minimum positional shift of 0.6 arcseconds will have a significance of @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the astrometric cut , only objects with good stellar profiles ( i.e. a classification statistic between @xmath9 and 3 ) were selected .",
    "we also excluded objects with magnitudes brighter than the saturation limit for each filter and those more than one magnitude fainter than the 2mass detection limit of @xmath2=15.8 .",
    "next we examined the ( @xmath10 ) vs. ( @xmath11 ) colour - colour plot found in leggett et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and set a cut that either ( @xmath10 ) had to be greater than 0.7 or ( @xmath10 ) had to be greater than 0.3 and ( @xmath11 ) less than zero .",
    "this allowed us to exclude the main mass of main sequence stars while still covering the areas where l and t dwarfs ( and the baraffe et al .",
    "2003 models for y dwarfs ) are expected to lie .",
    "all of these cuts were enacted using the sql query shown in appendix a. this was submitted to the wfcam science archive which returned our unpaired ukidss sample .    next we attempted to identify 2mass companions to the unpaired ukidss objects .",
    "this was done by searching through the appropriate 2mass files and identifying any good stellar object within 100 arcseconds of the ukidss object with a similar j band magnitude ( within one magnitude ) . to ensure that each 2mass object was not a non - moving coincidence background object",
    ", we then checked to ensure each object did not have a ukidss companion within the 0.6 arcsecond movement cut .",
    "this was done using the wsa crossid function .",
    "any 2mass object with a ukidss pair within 0.6 arcseconds was excluded from the sample .",
    "next the ukidss images of all the candidates were inspected by eye to remove any objects which could have poor astrometry resulting from deblended images or nearby bright stars .    to ensure accurate proper motion estimates we attempted to calculate individual astrometric solutions for each object in our sample . to do this we used the wsa cross - id function to identify all good stellar images within five arcminutes of each object in our sample .",
    "these objects provide a set of astrometric reference stars for each star in our sample .",
    "we then cross referenced these reference stars with the 2mass catalogue so we had their positions in both datasets . for each star in our sample",
    "we selected reference stars with j band brightnesses within one magnitude of the target and used these to do a standard six parameter plate - to - plate fit .",
    "this allows us to correct for any offsets between the astrometric systems and calculate local positional errors .",
    "if a target had too few reference stars ( five or fewer ) associated with it , no plate - to - plate fit was carried out and a magnitude dependent error estimate was taken from the global error estimate shown in figure  [ errplot ] . whether an object s astrometry uses the local or global astrometric solutions is indicated in the data tables ( see appendix b ) .",
    "only objects with proper motions more significant than 5@xmath7 were included in the final sample .",
    "however an astrometric solution calculated using too few reference stars will underestimate the positional errors .",
    "hence we carried out a series of simulations to estimate difference between the positional errors found using a set of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and the true positional error ( @xmath14 ) which we set as an input to our simulations .",
    "it was found that the following relationship was a good estimate for the underestimation of the positional errors , @xmath15 hence this equation was used to apply a correction factor to all the astrometric solutions calculated using sets of reference stars .",
    "the main aim of this study is to examine the population of ultracool dwarfs in the field .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that in the gcs areas , our 5@xmath7 lower proper motion cut could include some objects which are members of the target clusters .",
    "hence for the gcs data we have set a minimum proper motion of 80 milliarcseconds per year .",
    "this excludes objects with proper motions similar to all the gcs clusters with the exception of the hyades ( which does not appear in the dataset we use ) .",
    "our survey covers all the area included in the ukidss dr4 for the las and the gcs .",
    "these surveys consist of 993 sq.deg . and 148 sq.deg . of sky respectively .",
    "( 75,180 )    the large area survey ( las ) sample produced 213 candidate objects of which 44 are previously identified by other surveys .",
    "the galactic clusters survey ( gcs ) produced a sample of 54 objects , 12 of which are previously known .",
    "a list of all the objects identified can be found in appendix b. figure  [ ccdiagram ] shows infrared colour  colour diagrams for both survey samples . in both cases",
    "it is clear that there is only one object which is both redder than @xmath10=1.1 and bluer than @xmath11=0.5 . comparing these with colours from hewett et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we can conclude that there is only one object with a spectral type later than t3 in our sample ( our full sample includes all objects found in the las and gcs ) .",
    "one clear difference between the two samples of objects found in the las and those found in the gcs is the appearance of several objects above the main m dwarf locus in the gcs sample . by comparison",
    "the las sample has a tight stellar locus which becomes less dense towards the l dwarf regime ( redder than @xmath10=1.1 ) .",
    "one member of this second locus is nltt 42735 , an object which appears in the initial denis low mass stars sample of crifo et al .",
    "they use spectroscopy to identify nltt 42735 ( ugcs2mass1625@xmath162400 ) as a reddened f ",
    "k type star and hence exclude it from their final sample .",
    "they point out that its reddening is probably due to its proximity to a known molecular cloud .",
    "checking our seven objects ( ugcs2mass0408 + 2447 , ugcs2mass0536 - 0454 , ugcs2mass0433 + 2933 , ugcs2mass05410305 , ugcs2mass16252400 , ugcs2mass16312404 and ugcs2mass1637 - 2200 ) which lie above the main stellar locus using the simbad database reveals that five are within ten arcminutes of know molecular clouds or dark nebulae . given that this second locus only appears in the gcs ( which samples clusters which lie close to star formation regions ) and not in the las ( which samples an area of high galactic latitude ) we believe we can assume that it consists of earlier  type stars which lie behind the star formation regions and are reddened by the gas and dust .",
    "as we do not believe these objects are true low mass stars or brown dwarfs , we recommend that they are excluded from any cool dwarf sample derived from our data . as a number of other objects",
    "appear to lie only slightly above the main stellar locus we would advise anyone using our gcs sample to bear in mind that these objects may be reddened early type stars also .",
    "the prime motivator for this survey is to identify a clean sample ultracool dwarfs .",
    "to further this aim we selected objects in our sample which were redder than @xmath10=1.1 . according to hewett et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this should give us a sample completely free from m dwarfs and earlier spectral types .",
    "the objects identified are listed in table  [ ldwarfs ] along with their astrometry and photometry . of the total of nineteen objects",
    "listed , eleven are previously known ( one of which is a previously identified t dwarf ) . hence of the eighteen objects with l dwarf  like colours only ten are previously known .",
    "clearly spectroscopic identification of the previously unidentified eight objects is required , but even if only a few are genuine l dwarfs , this would indicate incompleteness in our current knowledge of even the relatively bright l dwarf population .",

    "we use this relation along with sloan photometry and choose the calculated spectral type where the photometry and the colour relation are in best agreement .",

    "<S> we detect 267 low mass stars and brown dwarfs with significant proper motions . </S>",
    "<S> we recover all ten known single l dwarfs and the one known t dwarf above the 2mass detection limit in our las survey area and identify eight additional new candidate l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we also find one new candidate l dwarf in our gcs sample . </S>",
    "<S> our sample also contains objects from eleven potential common proper motion binaries . </S>",
    "<S> finally we test our proper motions and find that while the las objects have proper motions consistent with absolute proper motions , the gcs stars may have proper motions which are significantly under - estimated . </S>",
    "<S> this is due possibly to the bulk motion of some of the local astrometric reference stars used in the proper motion determination .    </S>",
