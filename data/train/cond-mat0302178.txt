    "the discovery of ferromagnetism in mn - doped gaas and inas @xcite has changed conventional thinking about electronics .",
    "in fact these diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) combine the functionalities of semiconductors with those of magnetic materials , paving the way for a complete integration of data storage and logic on the same electronic component @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the most widely studied dms , ( ga , mn)as , shows a curie temperature ( @xmath0 ) far below room temperature and therefore appears to be unsuitable for commercial applications .",
    "this has led to a considerable world - wide effort in searching for new dmss with higher @xmath0s .",
    "part of this research is guided by a pioneering theoretical work by dietl and collaborators , who predicted remarkably high @xmath0s for wide - gap magnetic semiconductors at moderate mn doping @xcite .",
    "their model is based on the zener mechanism for ferromagnetism , according to which a conduction electron can hop across two magnetic atoms through a double exchange of place with the valence electrons of the bridging anions .",
    "spin - conservation implies that this conduction can only occur between spin - aligned magnetic centers , thus a ferromagnetic ordering of the mn ions is expected . in the model",
    ", @xmath0 is crucially dependent on hole and mn concentration , and on the strength of their mutual coupling .",
    "high @xmath0 ferromagnetism in wide - gap dmss has recently been confirmed by several groups who reported the existence of above - room - temperature ferromagnetism in ga@xmath1mn@xmath2n @xcite . however , in contrast to `` conventional '' as - based dmss , where the existence of double - exchange induced ferromagnetism is clear , the origin and the nature of the observed magnetism in ga@xmath1mn@xmath2n are controversial .",
    "on one hand , both @xmath3- and @xmath4-doped samples are , apparently , ferromagnetic , thus indicating that hole - mediated double - exchange may not be , in fact , the driving mechanism .",
    "more importantly , recent magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) measurements @xcite on high @xmath0 samples show that the mcd signal in the vicinity of the gan band - gap comes from a paramagnetic phase .",
    "this suggests the possibility of two phases in ( ga , mn)n : a paramagnetic phase , attributed to substitutional mn at the ga site , and dominated by @xmath5-@xmath6 interactions between mn and the host gan , and an unidentified ferromagnetic phase , not detected by mcd , which might be due to small particles that are invisible to diffraction methods@xcite .    in summary , there are sound indications that ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n may not be , in fact , very similar as far as magnetic ordering is concerned .",
    "thus a careful examination of their microscopic properties is necessary in order to give a correct interpretation of the experimental results .    with this goal in mind ,",
    "in this paper we investigate the electronic structures of zincblende ( ga , mn)as and wurtzite ( ga , mn)n using first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "band energy calculations for these compounds obtained within the familiar local - spin density functional theory ( lsda ) are already present in the literature.@xcite here we present the results obtained with our recently developed pseudopotential self - interaction free approach ( pseudo - sic).@xcite    it is known that the band energies calculated within lsda have systematic errors caused by the presence in the one - electron kohn - sham ( ks ) potential of its self - interaction ( si)@xcite ( that is the interaction of an electron with the potential generated by the electron itself ) .",
    "the si is especially relevant in ionic and mixed ionic - covalent materials . indeed",
    "the poor lsda description of the electronic properties of ii - vi semiconductors @xcite , transition metal oxides @xcite , and magnetic perovskites @xcite is a consequence of the si @xcite . in general ,",
    "any compound characterized by localized electron charges is , in principle , affected by a non - vanishing , unphysical , si contribution .",
    "regarding the compounds investigated in this paper , it is known that the lsda band structure of bulk gan shows severe discrepancies with photoemission results ( for example the fundamental energy gap is severely underestimated and the position of the @xmath6 bands is incorrect ) .",
    "furthermore , the lsda is generally inaccurate in describing the electronic properties of oxides of manganese , and in particular fails to give the correct position of the mn d states with respect to the oxygen - derived valence manifold .    since the band gap of the host material and the position of the transition metal d states are crucial in the description of these diluted magnetic semiconductors , there is the necessity to confront the lsda description with alternative approaches .",
    "our pseudo - sic is ideally suited for this task since it repairs to a large extent the lsda failures and provides a reliable description of the electronic properties for a large range of materials , including gan and mn - based perovskites .",
    "in addition , and in contrast with other beyond - lsda approaches , our method preserves the conceptual simplicity and the computational feasibility of the lsda , and thus the possibility to approach large - sized systems such as the diluted magnetic semiconductors .    in this paper",
    "we determine the extent to which correction of the si changes the electronic properties and the chemical pictures of wurtzite ( ga , mn)n and zincblende ( ga , mn)as .",
    "we find that in ( ga , mn)as the localization of the mn 3d electrons is weak because both on - site and off - site hybridizations occur , and , as a consequence , the si is not strong .",
    "therefore the lsda already provides a good description of ( ga , mn)as and the pseudo - sic does not make large qualitative changes . in ( ga , mn)n , however , the si is much stronger , due to the large n electronegativity , and consequent higher ionicity of gan .",
    "therefore the lsda description is inadequate and the pseudo - sic gives qualitatively different results .",
    "the difference in localization between the two compounds in turn has a profound effect on their electronic properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ method ] we describe the methodology and the technicalities used for the calculations .",
    "sections [ gamnas ] and [ gamnn ] present the results for ( ga , mn)as , and ( ga , mn)n , respectively . finally , in sections [ disc ] and [ concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this paper we use our recently developed self - interaction free local - density scheme @xcite based on ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite and a plane wave basis .",
    "the scheme is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we summarize the key points .",
    "the kohn - sham equations are modified in order to effectively extract from the one - electron potential the spurious self - interaction contribution :    @xmath7|\\psi^{\\sigma}_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle= \\epsilon^{\\sigma}_{n{\\bf k}}\\,|\\psi^{\\sigma}_{n{\\bf k}}\\rangle , \\label{ks - sic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the usual ion - core pseudopotential projector , @xmath9 the lsda - ks potential , and @xmath10 the sic term .",
    "the latter is cast as a nonlocal kleinman - bylander - type pseudopotential projector : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the pseudowavefunction , @xmath13 $ ] the si potential of the @xmath14 atomic orbital ( @xmath15 runs over angular quantum numbers and atomic positions , @xmath16 over the spin ) , and @xmath17 is the corresponding occupation number calculated self - consistently by projecting the bloch state manifold onto the basis of atomic pseudowavefunctions .",
    "this procedure is no more computationally demanding than the usual lsda , and , in contrast with other sic schemes @xcite , it can be applied to both metals and insulators , a feature which is crucial for the present application .    in earlier work our method was applied to a number of different systems including iii - v and ii - vi ionic semiconductors ( e.g. gan and zno),@xcite transition metal monoxides ( mno , nio)@xcite and perovskites ( camno@xmath18 , batio@xmath18 , ymno@xmath18)@xcite . in all cases",
    "the pseudo - sic obtained both the correct physical structures , and band structures in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments .",
    "this series of successes lends strong support to the credibility of the present results .",
    "we use ultrasoft pseudopotentials to allow moderate cut - off energies ( 35 ryd and 40 ryd for ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n , respectively ) . for the pseudo - sic calculations",
    "the ga 3d electrons are treated as core states ( this choice is fully justified in ref . @xcite . ) for zincblende ( ga , mn)as and wurtzite ( ga , mn)n 16-atom and 32-atom supercells are used respectively , in each case with one mn ion substituting for one ga ion , corresponding to doping levels of @xmath19 12% and @xmath19 6% .",
    "the lattice parameters are fixed to the values calculated for the host materials ( a = 10.68 bohr for gaas , a = 6.03 bohr , c= 9.802 bohr , u= 0.377 for gan ) , which are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the calculated lsda band structure of ( ga , mn)as ( in figure [ mnas_band ] ) is that of an half - metal with metallicity in the majority spin band . here",
    "the most important feature for the electronic and magnetic behavior is given by the three bands crossing the fermi energy in the majority manifold .",
    "they are rather dispersed and span @xmath192 ev between @xmath20 and m. an orbital decomposition of these bands shows that they consist of mn d @xmath21 character , as well as mn and as @xmath3 , with significant contributions from both nearest and next - nearest neighbor as ions .",
    "this indicates that part of the charge is extended beyond the mn - centered tetrahedron .",
    "the next set of bands lower in energy corresponds to the valence band top of bulk gaas at the @xmath20 point ( @xmath22ev ) but mixes in mn character elsewhere in the brillouin zone , as does the doublet below it .",
    "an orbital decomposition shows that the mn d character is not restricted to a single set of bands close to the fermi level , but instead is widely distributed through the gaas sp valence manifold .",
    "= 6.5 cm    in the upper part of table [ tab_gamnas_lsd1 ] we report the occupation numbers of individual orbitals .",
    "the total magnetization per cell is @xmath19 4 @xmath23 , almost entirely due to the mn ( 3.72  @xmath23 ) .",
    "the mn d electron charge is 5.48 , of which 4.61 and 0.87 comes from spin - up and spin - down electrons , respectively .",
    ".occupation numbers for selected orbitals of ( ga , mn)as calculated within lsda ( top ) and pseudo - sic ( bottom ) .",
    "the arrows indicate spin - up ( majority ) and spin - down ( minority ) components , respectively .",
    "as@xmath24 indicates the as atoms adjacent to the mn ion . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have compared the electronic structure of ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n within standard lsda and within our pseudo - sic approach which sets the ks potential free of the spurious self - interaction part .",
    "our results indicate two main conclusions .",
    "first , that the lsda picture of ( ga , mn)as as a half - metal , with the fermi energy crossing three weakly correlated bands which derive from mn d - as p hybridized states , is indeed a good description , largely unchanged when the self - interaction is corrected .",
    "however for ( ga , mn)n the lsda description is inadequate because the d electrons are strongly correlated , and thus the pseudo - sic description is markedly different from that of the lsda .",
    "second , that the behavior of ( ga , mn)n is qualitatively different from that of ( ga , mn)as . three flat bands of d@xmath25 , d@xmath26 , and d@xmath27 character are partially occupied by two spin - polarized electrons , confined within the mn - centered tetrahedron , thus effectively describing a highly confined hole around the fermi energy which may be more consistent with the formation of a zhang - rice polaron , rather than with the free - hole mediated double - exchange mechanism of the zener model .",
