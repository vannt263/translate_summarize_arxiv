    "our present study addresses both partial contributions and the integral effect of the aforementioned improvements in a combined rc environment of a two - junction sinis trap .",
    "different sample geometries are analyzed with regard to the suppression of noise - activated tunneling and possible propagation ways of the noise photons .",
    "our trapping device , shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , included a two - junction sinis turnstile , either with or without a high - ohmic cr resistor on the source side , and a dc - set sinis electrometer .",
    "the electrometer was coupled capacitively to the opposite , open - end terminal of the turnstile , used as an electron trapping reservoir with discrete states .",
    "all four sin(nis ) junctions were nominally of the same area , which was used in estimating the parameters of the turnstile : the charging energy @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the capacitance of a tunnel junction , the tunnel resistance @xmath9 , and the superconducting gap of the aluminum s leads @xmath10ev , based on those data obtained for the electrometer .",

    "the average switching interval ( hold time ) @xmath11 was assumed to be inversely proportional to the escape rate and , determined for the trap adjusted to its maximum coulomb barrier @xmath12 , could be compared with our follow - up of the eat model developed in refs .",

    "the devices under test were fabricated on thermally oxidized silicon substrates using the three - shadow evaporation process described previously in ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . that formerly developed process included the fabrication of a 50  nm - thick coplanar ground plane ( cgp ) of au , which was also common for all the samples reviewed here ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . for the present study , every",

    "the structures indexed as `` a '' and `` b '' , located on the same sample and differing only by the value of @xmath19 , were measured within the same low - temperature cycle , which made possible a direct comparison of an effect of the low- and high - ohmic environment .",
    "we interpret our data in the framework of the eat model @xcite .",
    "we assume a black - body radiation noise of the environment , equilibrated at the temperature level of the closest radiation shield , @xmath32  @xmath27  1  k , being the most probable source of higher - energy excitations .",
    "it is further assumed that the s leads are originally free of quasiparticles ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the dominant recharging cycles start with an electron tunneling from the n island , as depicted in the inset in fig .",

    "this energetically unfavorable process is stimulated by the voltage noise across the sin junctions , and we model the noise effect by introducing a phenomenological non - equilibrium population of states @xmath33 above the fermi - level in the normal metal , @xmath34 . in our approximate model , the dimensionless noise intensity pre - factor @xmath35 is accepted being independent on the parameters of the trapping device itself , but solely related to the noise properties of the environment .",
    "for the rate calculation , we make use of the very low temperatures of both s and n leads , @xmath36 , which reduces the golden - rule tunneling formula to the simplified zero - temperature case :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the bcs density of states in a superconductor and the function @xmath39 , the absorption spectrum of the environment , is that for the pure ohmic environment @xmath19 at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "an electron escape across the turnstile is completed by tunneling through the second sin junction at much higher rate , thus making the onset rate defined in equation [ eq : goldenrule ] the dominant term in the overall escape rate : @xmath40 .",
    "the tunneling rate @xmath41 appears in equation  [ eq : goldenrule ] proportional to the noise pre - factor @xmath35 , so the hold time of similar trapping devices should provide a direct measure of the on - chip noise suppression through @xmath42 .    , where @xmath43  25.8  k@xmath21 is the resistance quantum , calculated for @xmath44  =  250 ,  300 ,  500 , and 1000  @xmath20ev from top to bottom and @xmath32=  1  k. the crossed circles indicate the parameters of the samples under study.,width=288 ]    figure  [ fig3 ] predicts a reduction of the tunneling rate by increasing the resistance @xmath19 .",
    "there is a reasonable agreement with the hold times in samples  3a and 3b and still quantitative deviation from the data obtained for samples  1a , b and 2a , b .",
    "in particular , an increase up to @xmath45  500  s due to @xmath19  =  150  k@xmath21 is as high as by two orders of magnitude between samples  3a and 3b . within the sample pairs 1a ,",
    "b and 2a , b with a lower value of @xmath46  250  @xmath20ev and @xmath47  1  s , the model predicts factor 3 smaller ratios of the hold times . nevertheless , the experimental ratios were found to be even smaller than the predicted ones , presumably , due to the finite frequency bandwidth of our detector .",
    "a pronounced effect of the bottom plane was observed in the comparison of sample  5 to sample  4 .",
    "taking into account the calculated data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as well as the experimental data in table  [ table1 ] , one can conclude on the ratio @xmath48@xmath27  @xmath49 as an effect of the bottom plane .",
    "a further comparison of samples  5 and 3a , positioned at a larger distance @xmath18 to the large - area planes , indicates noise suppression by factor @xmath50@xmath27  @xmath51 in vicinity of the shielding planes . since for both samples",
    "the on - chip filtering design is identical , we conclude on the space propagation channel for the noise photons .",
    "finally , we note that the derived relative values of @xmath35 depend exponentially on the measured uncertainties in @xmath52 and @xmath32 and need more direct confirmation .    to conclude ,",
    "a hold time of an sinis trap was measured for various specially engineered on - chip electromagnetic environments .",
    "the combined effect of both the high - ohmic resistor and the improvement in the sample geometry ( samples 2b and 5 ) manifested itself in the hold time increase by about four orders of magnitude .",
    "strong partial effects of both the high - ohmic resistor and the on - chip rc filtering ( bottom plane ) were observed .",
    "further experiments are in progress to quantify the effect of the sample design on the noise - activated tunneling processes .",
