    "the question of the structure of the eigenfunctions of chaotic systems is intimately related to the construction of the bases in which they can be expanded . in this respect",
    "a good basis is one in which most eigenstates are given in terms of a limited number of significant coefficients : a good measure being i.e. the average participation ratio in the given basis . in the generic case of a basis unrelated to the hamiltonian ( or the map ) the states are mostly random and the average participation ratio ( @xmath0 ) takes the random matrix value @xmath1 ( for a hilbert space of dimension @xmath2 ) . at the other _ trivial _ extreme the eigen basis gives a @xmath0 of unity .",
    "it is then clear that a `` good '' basis has to incorporate some dynamical elements from the system and at the same time be sufficiently simple so as to be effectively constructed without resorting to a full diagonalization . + in the case of the quantum baker s map ( qbm ) lakshminarayan found that the eigenfunctions had a simple structure ( and significantly small participation ratio ) when looked upon in the hadamard basis @xcite , thus exploiting a very special property of the qbm .",
    "this line of research was followed in @xcite , where it was found that the eigenfunctions of a large family of quantizations of the qbm could be described in terms of a very simple map , the essential baker , which for special values of the hilbert space dimension becomes the walsh quantized baker and can be explicitly constructed .",
    "these features are very special and intimately related to the binary symbolic dynamics of the map and are not easily generalized to other systems . + a different approach with a potentially more general applicability , is based on the construction of states that `` live '' on the unstable periodic orbits of the system . when used as a basis",
    "these states realize in quantum mechanics the ideal of poincar in the sense that `` they ( the periodic orbits ) are the only breach through we might try to penetrate into a stronghold hitherto reputed unassailable '' @xcite .",
    "the fact that some eigenstates of chaotic systems show `` scars '' of periodic orbits was established long ago by heller @xcite , in counterpart to earlier works in which the assumption was a uniform distribution on the energy shell according to the microcanonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "the scarring phenomena was studied in several chaotic systems , in which linear and non - linear theories were developed @xcite .",
    "+ the construction of scar functions in the qbm is based on early studies in the stadium billiard @xcite",
    ". the qbm can be thought of as a pedagogical system to apply these techniques since it has symbolic dynamics , stable ( unstable ) manifold parallel to @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) direction , a finite spectrum and the same small - valued lyapunov exponent in the entire phase space .",
    "+ in this paper we provide a recipe to construct a set of scar functions as an accurate basis to describe the qbm .",
    "this basis has the propagation time of the quantum propagator as parameter .",
    "when this time is of the order of the heisenberg time , the basis converges to the eigen base of the map . for short times , of the order of the ehrenfest time , the basis describes the spectrum of the qbm better than other known bases @xcite .",
    "+ in section ii , we briefly introduce the classical and quantum version of the baker map .",
    "we construct the periodic orbit modes and scar functions based on the evolution of the coherent states under the qbm .",
    "we give the rule with which we choose a basis to describe the spectrum of the qbm for any even dimensional hilbert space in section iii .",
    "then , in section iv , we numerically test the basis , computing the average participation ratio as a function of the propagation time . in section",
    "v we propose a method to approximate the scar functions by homoclinic periodic orbit modes avoiding evolution in time , and finally , we state the conclusions .",
    "in this section we review some properties and notation of the classical baker s map that we will use in the quantum states construction . the baker s",

    "the baker map has a simple action upon symbols in the binary expansion of the coordinates @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the map has two symmetries :    * parity ( @xmath16 ) : represented with the exchanges and @xmath17 together with the bitwise logical not upon symbols @xmath18 . * time reversal ( @xmath19 ) : represented with the exchange together with reversing the direction of the symbolic flow .",
    "the periodic orbits of the baker map of period @xmath20 can be represented by binary strings @xmath21 of length @xmath20 .",
    "we denote the different trajectory points on a periodic orbit by for @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the coordinates of the first trajectory point on the periodic orbit can be obtained explicitly in terms of the binary string @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the integer value of the string @xmath21 which represents a binary number , and @xmath26 is the string formed by all @xmath20 bits of @xmath21 in reverse order .",
