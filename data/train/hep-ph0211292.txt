    "the study of electro - weak n-@xmath0 transition amplitudes , together with an understanding of the corresponding pion electro - production process at low energies , provides information on the structure of the nucleon and its first excited state .",
    "for example , the electro - magnetic transition amplitudes for the processes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are sensitive to the deviation of the nucleon shape from spherical symmetry @xcite . below the @xmath0 resonance ( and in particular close to the pion - production threshold ) , the reaction @xmath3 also yields information on the nucleon axial and induced pseudo - scalar form - factors .",
    "while the electro - production of pions at relatively high @xcite and low @xcite momentum transfers has been intensively investigated experimentally in the past years at modern electron accelerator facilities , very little data exist on the corresponding weak axial processes .",
    "in a phenomenological approach , the nucleon axial form - factor is one of the quantities needed to extract the weak axial amplitudes in the @xmath0 region .",
    "there are basically two methods to determine this form - factor .",
    "one set of experimental data comes from measurements of quasi - elastic ( anti)neutrino scattering on protons , deuterons , heavier nuclei , and composite targets ( see @xcite for a comprehensive list of references ) . in the quasi - elastic picture of ( anti)neutrino - nucleus scattering",
    ", the @xmath4 weak transition amplitude can be expressed in terms of the nucleon electro - magnetic form - factors and the axial form factor @xmath5 .",
    "the axial form - factor is extracted by fitting the @xmath6-dependence of the ( anti)neutrino - nucleon cross section , @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is contained in the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 coefficients and is assumed to be the only unknown quantity .",
    "it can be parameterised in terms of an ` axial mass ' @xmath12 as @xmath13    another body of data comes from charged pion electro - production on protons ( see @xcite and references therein ) slightly above the pion production threshold .",
    "as opposed to neutrino scattering , which is described by the cabibbo - mixed @xmath14 theory , the extraction of the axial form factor from electro - production requires a more involved theoretical picture @xcite . the presently available most precise determination for @xmath12 from pion electro - production is @xmath15 which is @xmath16 larger than the axial mass @xmath17 known from neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "the weighted world - average estimate from electro - production data is @xmath18 , with an excess of @xmath19 with respect to the weak probe .",
    "the @xmath20 difference in @xmath12 can apparently be attributed to pion - loop corrections to the electro - production process @xcite .",

    "the matrix element is assumed to be invariant under time reversal , hence all form - factors @xmath41 are real .",
    "usually the conserved vector current hypothesis ( cvc ) is also assumed to hold .",

    "the allowed multipoles are the dominant magnetic dipole @xmath44 and the electric and coulomb quadrupole amplitudes @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which are found to be much smaller than @xmath44 @xcite .",

    "the key assumption in experimental analyses of the axial matrix element is the pcac .",
    "it implies that the divergence of the axial current should vanish as @xmath53 , which occurs if the induced pseudo - scalar term with @xmath54 ( the analogue of @xmath55 in the nucleon case ) is dominated by the pion pole . in consequence",

    ", adler s values for @xmath64 have conventionally been adopted to fix the fit - parameters at @xmath65 , i.  e. @xmath66 in such a situation , one ends up with @xmath67 as the only free fit - parameter .",
    "several observables are used to fit the @xmath6-dependence of the form - factors .",
    "most commonly used are the total cross - sections @xmath68 , and the angular distributions of the recoiling nucleon @xmath69\\,y_{20 }   + { 4\\over\\sqrt{10}}\\,\\tilde{\\rho}_{31}\\,\\mathrm{re}y_{21 }   - { 4\\over\\sqrt{10}}\\,\\tilde{\\rho}_{3 - 1}\\,\\mathrm{re}y_{22}\\,\\biggr]\\>{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 are the density matrix elements and @xmath71 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "better than from the @xmath70 coefficients , the @xmath6 dependence of the matrix element can be determined from the differential cross - section @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , since the dependence on @xmath73 and @xmath74 is anticipated to be weak at @xmath75 , then @xmath76    the refinements of this crude approach are dictated by several observations . if the target is a nucleus ( for example , the deuteron which is needed to access specific charge channels ) , nuclear effects need to be estimated .",
    "another important correction arises due to the finite energy width of the @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the non - zero mass of the scattered muon may play a role at low @xmath6 .",
    "all these effects have been addressed carefully in @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the differential cross - section to different nucleon - nucleon potentials was seen to be smaller than @xmath77 even at @xmath78 . in the range above that value , this allows one to interpret inelastic data on the deuteron as if they were data obtained on the free nucleon .",
    "the effect of non - zero muon mass is even less pronounced : it does not exceed @xmath79 in the region of @xmath80 . the energy dependence of the width of the @xmath0 resonance was observed to have a negligible effect on the cross - section .",
    "the final value based on the analysis of argonne data @xcite is @xmath81    at present , this is the best estimate for @xmath82 , although a number of phenomenological predictions also exist @xcite .",
    "we adopt this value for the purpose of comparison to our calculations .",
    "there is also some scarce , but direct experimental evidence from a free fit to the data that @xmath83 is indeed small and @xmath84 is close to the adler s value of @xmath85 ( see figure  [ barish79_fig16 ] ) .",
    "we use @xmath86 in our comparisons in the next section .     and @xmath84 as extracted from measurements of @xmath87 .",

    "the axial n-@xmath0 transition amplitudes can be interpreted in an illustrative way in quark models involving chiral fields like the linear @xmath88-model ( lsm ) , which may reveal the importance of non - quark degrees of freedom in baryons . due to difficulties in consistent incorporation of the pion field ,",
    "the model predictions for these amplitudes are very scarce @xcite .",
    "the present work @xcite was partly also motivated by the experience gained in the successful phenomenological description of the quadrupole electro - excitation of the @xmath0 within the lsm , in which the pion cloud was shown to play a major role @xcite .",
