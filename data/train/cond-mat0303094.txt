    "several years ago guiselin @xcite proposed an experiment to study irreversible polymer adsorption . in its simplest form",
    ", a melt is exposed to a surface so attractive to the polymer chains that they adsorb instantaneously and irreversibly .",
    "this freezes in melt chain configurations , including the size distribution of surface loops ( see fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) ) . the adsorbed layer",
    "is then swollen with solvent , washing away unattached chains .",
    "guiselin predicted that the resulting interfacial structure , which has come to be known as the `` guiselin brush , '' has a universal density profile , @xmath4 in good solvent .",
    "neutron scattering @xcite and neutron reflectivity @xcite studies have indicated density profiles both consistent @xcite and inconsistent @xcite with this prediction .",
    "in this letter we study the same irreversible melt adsorption processes as did guiselin , but we ask : what replaces the guiselin brush if the adsorption is _ not _ instantaneous ?",
    "the most important example of this is _ chemisorption _ where functionalized chains develop polymer - surface bonds which are usually irreversible .",
    "this arises in various technologies where polymers are attached to solid surfaces to permanently modify surface properties @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ scheme](a ) ) .",
    "for example in fiber - reinforced thermoplastics , strong polymer - fiber interfaces are frequently created by chemisorption of polymers onto the fibers after functionalization of fiber surfaces with coupling agents @xcite .",
    "another related class involves reinforcement of immiscible polymer interfaces by chemical reactions between multi - functionalized chains at the interfaces @xcite .    unlike the physisorption processes studied by guiselin ,",
    "chemisorption is extremely slow ( microscopically speaking ) in that 2 mutually reactive groups must collide millions of times , typically , before bonding @xcite .",
    "hence surface loops usually have time to explore all configurations before further reactions constrain their motion .",
    "as we will see , this leads to a different surface loop structure and a modified version of the guiselin brush after solvent swelling .    due to screening ,",
    "polymer melt statistics are ideal . now",
    "the probability a random walk originating from a surface never re - contacts that surface after @xmath5 steps is @xmath6 .",
    "its derivative gives the surface loop distribution @xmath7 in a melt .",
    "in guiselin s experiment this is instantaneously frozen in . to see why slow chemisorption produces different @xmath8 consider first an unentangled melt of chains each comprising @xmath9 chemically reactive units .",
    "chains within a coil radius @xmath10 of the surface make many surface contacts ( taking monomer size as unity ) .",
    "now reactions are switched on and the surface density ( per site of size unity ) of bonded monomers , @xmath11 , starts increasing from zero .",
    "after time @xmath12 , of order 1 polymer - surface bonds per chain in this slab will have been created , i.e.     gammabound - taun _",
    "bound(_n ) 1/n^1/2  ,   _",
    "n= 1/(q n^1/2 )  .    here",
    "@xmath13 is the local reaction rate _ given _ a polymer group contacts a surface site ( all of which are assumed reactive for simplicity ) .",
    "eq . equates the reacted fraction of surface sites , @xmath14 , to the number of chains per site in the slab , @xmath15 .",
    "at this stage the slab contains surface - grafted loops ( and tails ) of length @xmath16 .",
    "let us follow how one of these mother loops gradually adsorbs down onto the surface ( tails behave similarly ) from the moment of its creation . to begin , we ignore interference from other chains . because @xmath13 is small , the reaction rate of the loop s @xmath17 unit is proportional to its equilibrium surface contact probability . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "this is independent of @xmath9 ,    duck k(s|n ) k(s ) q / s^1/2  ,  ( sn )  .",
    "hence the loop lifetime , the inverse of its total reaction rate @xmath18 , is identified with @xmath12 of eq . .",
    "the loop evolution kinetics are @xcite    loop - kinetics _",
    "t(s ) = 2 _ s^n ds k(s|s ) _",
    "t(s ) - _ t(s ) _ 0^s ds k(s|s )  .    in this section @xmath19",
    "denotes time after the mother loop was created , and @xmath20 describes an ensemble of mother loops plus daughters . for small times , @xmath21 , to leading order there is just the single mother loop , @xmath22 .",
    "substitution into the first term in eq .",
    ", describing creation of @xmath5-loops , immediately gives    curried - rabbit _",
    "t(s ) = qt / s^1/2  ,  d^<(s ) = t/_s  ,  _",
    "s=1/(q s^1/2)(sn )  ,     where @xmath23 is the lifetime of an @xmath5-loop .",
    "note that the number of loops shorter than @xmath5 , @xmath24 , is very small since @xmath25 for these small loops .",
    "we conclude that in addition to the single mother @xmath9-loop there are of order @xmath26 smaller loops following a @xmath27 power law , distinct from the @xmath28 decay in the fast guiselin brush .",
    "note our argument neglected the second ( loop loss ) term : substituting the power law into eq .",
    ", one finds it is self - consistently much smaller ( of relative order @xmath29 ) than the source term .",
    "for times greater than its lifetime @xmath12 , the mother loop will have come down , spawning 2 daughter loops each of size @xmath30 since the total reaction rate @xmath31 is dominated by @xmath5 of order @xmath9 .",
    "the daughters will in turn spawn 2 roughly equal granddaughters , and so on .",
    "as this process iterates itself , more and more loops are generated ; the characteristic size after time @xmath19 is @xmath32 .",
    "bigger loops , @xmath33 have already come down ( @xmath34 ) whereas smaller loops have yet to be created ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we can think of the mother as having multiplied into @xmath36 offspring of equal size @xmath37 .    for much smaller loops , the source term in the kinetics eq .",
    "is now dominated by @xmath38 and gives @xmath39 .",
    "thus the loop distribution is    loop - distribution _ t(ss^ * ) ( s^ * ) ^1/2  ,   _ t(ss^ * ) 0  .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed analysis of the kinetics , eq .",
    ", which are able to justify the simple arguments presented here .",
    "these kinetics do indeed produce a distribution with the above features , i.e.  sharply cut off above @xmath37 and with @xmath27 behaviour for small @xmath5 .",
    "the crucial point is that single loop adsorption is a _ homogeneous collapse _ in which all parts of the mother loop come down essentially at the same time .",
    "generally , the class of adsorption kinetics is governed by the contact exponent @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "three classes are identified in refs .",
    "@xcite : zipping , for @xmath42 ; accelerated zipping for @xmath43 ; and homogeneous collapse , for @xmath44 .",
    "the present case , @xmath45 , is collapse ; because @xmath46 decays slowly , adsorption kinetics are dominated by distant units of order the current loop size .",
    "our single chain collapse description neglects interference from other chains , appropriate when only a small fraction of chains are reactive .",
    "however , when all chains simultaneously attempt to collapse as in the present situation , grafted loop surface densities rapidly reach criticality . quite generally , the critical density for a given loop size @xmath5 is    container - filled - with - hideous - rubbish d^>_crit(s ) = 1/s^1/2    per site . here",
    "@xmath47 counts loops equal to or bigger than @xmath5 , all of which contribute chain segments of length @xmath5 to the density . at the critical level",
    "their combined total mass ( @xmath5 per loop or strand ) just fills a layer of thickness @xmath48 , the equilibrium size . at higher densities",
    "the loops are stretched .",
    "returning to the many chain collapse issue , if all @xmath15 mother loops per site were able to collapse unhindered , each would generate @xmath49 loops of size @xmath37 by time @xmath19 , giving a net density @xmath50 .",
    "but since this exceeds the critical level , @xmath51 , it is clear the unhindered collapse costs energy and must have been interfered with .",
    "what then is the form of the loop distribution per site @xmath52 at time @xmath19 ? to proceed , we make the following assumptions : ( i ) at time @xmath19 , loops of size @xmath53 are created on the surface up to the critical density and no further , ( ii ) sizes greater than @xmath53 follow a power law distribution and ( iii ) this distribution is frozen in time . assumptions ( i ) , ( iii ) state that when enough time has elapsed for a certain loop size to have been created , creation of these loops proceeds but is then permanently switched off as soon as other chains in the layer are forced to stretch to accommodate further such loops .",
    "thus , equating @xmath54 to @xmath55 determines @xmath56 for all @xmath33 ( self - consistently , the integral s lower limit dominates ) .",
    "smaller loops , @xmath57 , follow a different power law . from our single chain analysis we know these are unlikely to have been created by time @xmath19 even without interference and must therefore be very dilute .",
    "for these , we can essentially repeat the single chain arguments : eq .",
    "( again dominated by the source term ) leads to @xmath58 where the total density of loops @xmath59 is dominated by @xmath37 .",
    "the crucial point is that smaller loops are sub - critical and follow free single chain kinetics , @xmath60 .",
    "their distribution thus follows the single chain power law @xmath61 . demanding continuity at @xmath37 the overall layer distribution , shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme](b ) , is    edible - car _",
    "t(s )  .    where @xmath62 are constants of order unity . from eq .",
    "the total density of loops bigger than @xmath5 is @xmath63 for any small loop size @xmath64 .",
    "this confirms that such loops are sub - critical , an important self - consistency check .",
    "a sketch of the adsorbed layer loop structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ blobs - melt](a ) , characterised by a hierarchy of successively smaller loops frozen in as they reach criticality .",
    "let us now ask what would happen in a guiselin type experiment where the chemisorption is interrupted after some time @xmath0 and the brush subsequently swollen with good swelling solvent .",
    "typical values of @xmath13 are in the range @xcite @xmath65 sec@xmath66 so surface saturation may not be reached for minutes or hours .",
    "after interruption , the loop distribution is frozen into the form given by eq . .",
    "neglecting distinctions between tails and loops @xcite , after solvent is introduced the `` guiselin brush '' structure is that of a polydisperse brush having chain length distribution @xmath52 evaluated at @xmath67 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the density profile of such polydisperse grafted layers was analysed , starting from the concept of a local blob size @xcite @xmath68 at height @xmath69 determined by the local chain grafting density @xmath70 .",
    "the coarse - grained chain stretching is @xmath71 where there are @xmath72 units per blob and the density profile is @xmath73 .",
    "the essential point is that only those chains ( or loops ) bigger than @xmath5 can reach the height @xmath74 so the effective grafting density is @xmath75 .",
    "this immediately gives @xmath76 , @xmath77 and brush height @xmath78 .    for the present structure we have @xmath79 for large loops @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 , valid provided @xmath83 .",
    "thus    fried - donut c(z )  ,  z^*(qt_final)^-5/3  ,     where @xmath84 . here @xmath85 is the total adsorbed mass per site and @xmath86 .",
    "this profile , sketched in fig .",
    "[ scheme](c ) , has two distinct regions .",
    "( 1 ) the inner region of total mass @xmath87 , a small fraction of the total , has constant density @xmath88 up to @xmath89 .",
    "( 2 ) the more diffuse outer part , from @xmath89 to the brush height @xmath90 , where density decays as @xmath91 .",
    "this latter is the same decay as for guiselin s physisorbed brush .",
    "thus as the chemisorption experiment is interrupted at later and later times @xmath0 so the inner region becomes progressively thinner and disappears at @xmath92 .",
    "the blob structure is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ blobs - melt](b ) .",
    "when a fraction @xmath93 of chain units are chemically reactive ( @xmath94 was considered so far ) there are now 2 monomer species whose relative affinity for the surface is an essential new parameter .",
    "suppose there is an energy penalty @xmath95 when a reactive monomer displaces an unreactive one adjacent to the surface .",
    "here we restrict attention to weakly repulsive or attractive surfaces , @xmath96 .    in the simplest case of a _",
    "neutral _ surface ( @xmath97 ) most of the previous discussion is unchanged provided one replaces @xmath98 and the loop cascade is truncated at @xmath99 at the corresponding loop lifetime , i.e.  at @xmath100 ( see eq . ) .",
    "that is , after coarse - graining over scales @xmath101 one recovers the case of @xmath102 functionalization , but with reduced effective reactivity @xmath103 .",
    "the final loop density is @xmath104 and the swollen guiselin brush is essentially unchanged , except that @xmath89 reaches a minimum value @xmath105 for long chemisorption times .",
    "this is actually a slight simplification ; @xmath106 can not be the true total surface loop density as @xmath107 , since the irreversibility of these reactions means that ultimately surface coverage must reach unity , @xmath108 .",
    "however , beyond @xmath0 further coverage requires bringing down larger loops above their critical density .",
    "we find the consequent stretching energy penalty leads to exponentially suppressed reaction rates @xcite and a slow logarithmic saturation @xmath109 .",
    "thus for very large reaction times we predict the inner constant - density region ( @xmath110 ) of the swollen brush will shrink and eventually disappear .",
    "consider now a surface weakly attractive to the reactive monomers , @xmath111 .",
    "their tendency to preferentially physisorb prior to the much slower process of chemisorption is then weak ; the entropic disadvantage ( giving free energy cost of order @xmath112 ) of immobilization at the surface is not worth the energy gain .",
    "similar remarks apply to weakly repulsive surfaces . in either case",
    ", the phenomenology is unchanged from the neutral case after replacing @xmath113 .",
    "let us also consider the more complex situations where only a fraction @xmath114 of chains are functionalised , beginning with neutral surfaces .",
    "the early stages of chemisorption now entail @xmath115 single chains adsorbing independently , each producing @xmath116 loops of size @xmath53 as described by eq . and preceding text .",
    "the net loop density is @xmath117 reaching criticality when loops of size @xmath118 have descended after time @xmath119 . the surface layer of thickness @xmath120 is saturated and adsorption of new chains then essentially halts .",
    "the swelling experiment produces a guiselin type brush as described previously , but with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath118 .",
    "incomplete functionalization , @xmath121 , is dealt with as before .",
    "non - neutral surfaces are more complex because segregation effects now play a crucial role .",
    "a mean field estimate of the energy of a chain close to the surface is proportional to the number of unperturbed surface contacts @xmath10 times the probability a given contact is a reactive monomer , @xmath122 .",
    "when this is below @xmath112 , i.e.  @xmath123 , the neutral surface phenomenology is unmodified . for more heavily functionalised chains ,",
    "chain configurations are strongly perturbed .",
    "this case will be discussed in ref .",
    "we end with a few remarks on how layer formation kinetics are interfered with by topological constraints , frozen in as interwoven loops are grafted to the surface .",
    "thus far such effects were neglected .",
    "consider for simplicity @xmath94 and neutral surfaces . at time @xmath19 , the layer is a network of grafted loops with characteristic length @xmath53 .",
    "this network , bathed in a `` solvent '' of ungrafted free chains , has monomer density @xmath124 .",
    "thus we expect topological constraints to be unimportant provided @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the entanglement threshold associated with this density . here",
    "@xmath127 is an empirical system - dependent exponent @xcite and @xmath128 the value in the melt .",
    "insisting on this condition at all stages during layer formation ( from @xmath129 at @xmath130 to @xmath131 at saturation ) we conclude that provided @xmath132 ( if @xmath133 ) or @xmath134 ( if @xmath135 ) then loops can always explore all configurations and loop rate constants @xmath136 are governed by gaussian statistics as assumed in our picture . if this condition is satisfied , topological constraints are irrelevant even after saturation , @xmath137 , since @xmath37 then continues to decrease while the monomer density of the non - frozen part of the network ( @xmath138 ) remains unity .",
    "hence this part remains unentangled .    in summary , topological constraints",
    "do not interfere with the layer kinetics provided either : ( i ) the melt is unentangled or ( ii ) if the melt is entangled , the reactive chain fraction @xmath114 must be small enough , @xmath139 ( taking a typical value @xmath140 ) .",
    "the local reaction rate @xmath13 must also be small enough to allow exploration of all chain configurations before inhibition by further reactions .",
    "noting an unreacted loop of length @xmath9 makes of order @xmath10 surface contacts , the condition is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the loop rouse relaxation time ( for unentangled melts@xcite ) or @xmath143 ( for entangled melts where loops relax via constraint release @xcite ) . if the conditions on @xmath9 and @xmath114 are not satisfied , then no matter how small @xmath13 at a certain stage the entire layer freezes on scales large enough to be entangled ( with the exception of tails which can relax via arm retraction mechanisms @xcite ) .",
    "these situations will be discussed in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "we have shown that slow formation of an adsorbed surface layer from a melt leads to a modified version of the guiselin brush after swelling with solvent .",
    "in fact if the adsorption process is allowed to proceed to completion ( @xmath144 ) the density profile of the swollen brush is unchanged from that predicted by guiselin for instantaneous adsorption . for general interruption times @xmath0",
    ", there appears a new inner region of constant density whose width depends on @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that reactions produce a characteristic loop distribution at the surface consisting of two power laws for small and large loops , respectively , with the dividing loop size @xmath37 dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "our analysis describes systems where some or all chain units attach irreversibly to a surface but require many collisions to `` cement in '' these attachments .",
    "this is important in many applications involving chemisorption where the polymer loops created by surface reactions serve as bridges enhancing interfacial fracture toughness and yield stress after cooling @xcite .",
    "the resulting interfacial strength depends strongly on loop size distributions @xcite ."
