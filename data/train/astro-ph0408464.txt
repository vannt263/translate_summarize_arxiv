    "dark energy_. not much is known about the nature this new form of energy but different candidates have been suggested such as a cosmological constant or a slowly rolling scalar field ( also called quintessence  field or cosmon  field ) ( see @xcite and @xcite for early work and e.g. @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "a challenge for particle physics is to identify candidates with the right properties .",
    "for example , the coupling of any new matter type to ordinary matter can not be too large , otherwise dark energy would have been detected in the form of an additional force acting on bodies in laboratory experiments .",
    "if current observations are confirmed by future experiments , it is highly probable that an explanation for dark energy will involve new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "one possible type of new physics beyond the standard model is the idea of extra dimensions . among the models with higher dimensions ,",
    "brane worlds have attracted a lot of attention recently . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that the current accelerated expansion is due to the effects of extra spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "such models can be tested ( or constrained ) with the observation of the cmb anisotropies , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "higher dimensional theories provide a plethora of scalar fields which usually couple to matter .",
    "string theory , for example , predicts the existence of the dilaton field , which couples universally to all matter forms .",
    "another example is the brane world theory , according to which our universe is a hypersurface embedded in a higher dimensional space .",
    "there , scalar fields in the bulk and/or the size of the extra dimensional space - time manifest themselves as scalar fields in the low  energy description of the system . usually , all these fields couple to all matter forms confined on the brane",
    "it is so far not known if these fields can play the rle of dark energy and , at the same time , remain hidden from experiments on earth .",
    "several proposals have been made in the past , in which the quintessence field couples to baryons and/or dark matter ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "cosmological considerations , such as nucleosynthesis , the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation , structure formation , etc . ,",
    "constrain the coupling of the quintessence field to matter ( baryonic or non  baryonic ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a system of two branes and bulk scalar field as a specific setup of a higher  dimensional theory .",
    "we discuss under which conditions the radion , i.e. the interbrane distance , can be a candidate for dark energy and if , at the same time , the theory is compatible with local experiments .",
    "we are going to assume that a potential for the radion field has been generated , for example by non ",
    "perturbative effects .",
    "therefore , in our model the dynamics of the radion is governed by scalar field self - interactions and interaction with surrounding matter .",
    "such fields , in which the effective potential is matter ( environment ) dependent , have recently been dubbed _",
    "chameleon fields _ and arise usually in scalar ",
    "tensor theories with a potential for the scalar field @xcite .",
    "we show that for scalar ",
    "tensor theories with an essentially linear coupling function , one can evade local tests thanks to the existence of a thin  shell regime : the chameleon field is basically constant inside a big , spherical body and varies only inside a thin  shell close to the outer edge of the body .",
    "this implies that the fifth force outside the body is a small correction to newton s law .",
    "there are two regimes for the radion in the brane model we consider . at small distances ( i.e. distances smaller than the bulk curvature scale )",
    ", the radion possesses the thin  shell property while at large distance ( distances larger than the bulk curvature scale ) no thin - shell regime exists . the thin ",
    "shell case is expounded in @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the case of thick  shells at large distances between the branes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe briefly the chameleon properties . in particular ,",
    "thin and thick shells are discussed . in section 3",
    "we focus on the radion and show that both possibilities are realised at either small or large distances . in section 4",
    "we investigate first the inverse power ",
    "law potential in detail .",
    "after discussing the cosmological evolution , we elaborate on local experiments and constraints .",
    "these constraints are stringent .",
    "we then generalise these results to a class of potentials where , at large distances between the branes , the radion can both be a quintessence field and comply with gravity experiments . in section 5 we discuss a non  standard potential and the consequences for the evolution of the radion .",
    "we present our conclusion in section 6 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the properties of chameleon fields . because these fields appear naturally in scalar",
    " tensor theories of gravity in which the scalar field has a potential , we begin with a discussion of these theories .",
    "we consider theories where a scalar field @xmath0 couples both to gravity and matter , generating a potential fifth force .",
    "the lagrangian of such scalar  tensor theories reads @xmath1 notice that @xmath0 is dimension  less . redefining @xmath2 leads to a dimension ",
    "one field . here , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "matter couples to both gravity and the scalar field according to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a matter field and @xmath7 is an arbitrary function of @xmath0 .",
    "the klein ",
    "gordon equation for the scalar field involves a coupling to the trace of the matter energy  momentum tensor @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 the energy  momentum tensor in the einstein frame fulfills @xmath11 in a friedmann  robertson  walker universe these equation simplify to @xmath12 together with @xmath13 redefining @xmath14 one can easily verify that @xmath15 is the usual energy density .    the klein ",
    "gordon equation can be written in terms of an effective potential @xmath16 where @xmath17 the effective potential depends on the environment through @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , we will assume that @xmath19 is a runaway potential and for the models we consider @xmath20 increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the potential has a minimum for @xmath21 such a field has been called a chameleon field .",
    "the field , when sitting at the minimum , becomes massive with mass @xmath22 @xmath23 evaluated at the minimum . in this equation , we have made use of the fact that , at the minimum , @xmath0 is a function of @xmath24 , as seen from equation ( [ minimum ] ) .",
    "dimensionally the mass is proportional to @xmath25 on cosmological scales , i.e. the field at the minimum has a very small mass .",
    "naively , one would expect that in that case solar system experiments would lead to very strong constraints on the models .",
    "however , because the effective mass depends on the energy density of the environment , this is not necessarily true .      in the following ,",
    "we impose constraints springing from local experiments , i.e. solar system experiments .",
    "the field @xmath0 acts on all types of matter and , in the einstein frame , there is a new force associated with the scalar field .",
    "therefore , massive particles no longer follow geodesics with respect to the einstein frame metric .",
    "the equations of motion in the einstein frame are @xmath26 in this equation , @xmath27 represents the four  vector describing the worldline of a test particle moving in the metric @xmath28 , @xmath29 represents the christoffel symbols for the metric @xmath28 .",
    "the last term is a new contribution , representing the force from the scalar field , which is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mass of the test particle .",
    "the force @xmath32 can not be too large , otherwise experiments would have already detected it .",
    "what is the profile @xmath33 for an object like the earth ? modelling the earth as a spherical object with constant density @xmath34 , the equation for @xmath0 ( i.e. the klein ",
    "gordon equation ) , reads for @xmath35 @xmath36 whereas for @xmath37 we assume that the field is close to its minimum @xmath38 determined cosmologically ( we assume that space is empty outside the body ) @xmath39 for the function @xmath20 , we will focus on the form @xmath40 in this paper , we will consider the case in which @xmath41 is of order one . as we will show when @xmath42 a thin  shell regime exists , whereas for @xmath43 there are no thin shells even for massive bodies .",
    "the case @xmath44 is pathological as it leads to no thin - shell and an infinite repulsive force in the core of the spherical body .",
    "putting @xmath45 we get @xmath46 let us discuss the case @xmath42 first .",
    "we will solve the equations of motion inside and outside the spherical body .",
    "we will assume that the minimum outside the body @xmath38 is greater that the minimum inside @xmath47 .",
    "this is the case for simple potentials like an inverse power law .",
    "first of all , we impose that @xmath48 at @xmath49 . interpreting the equations of motion as classical mechanics in the effective potential @xmath50",
    ", this corresponds to no velocity at the origin .",
    "moreover we fix the value of the field there to be near the minimum @xmath47 of the effective potential inside the body .",
    "the solution can be approximated in three different regions .",
    "first for @xmath51 the field is constant @xmath52 . in a shell @xmath53",
    "the field is increasing in order to match the value @xmath54 .",
    "it reads @xmath55 outside the body for @xmath56 the field behaves like a yukawa potential @xmath57 in the vicinity of the body and using the fact that @xmath58 we can neglect the exponential profile .",
    "hence the outside the body the force is a correction to newton s law . matching at @xmath59 leads to @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the gravitational potential on the surface of the body . because @xmath0 can be viewed as a potential for a new , fifth force ( see eq .",
    "( [ fifthforce ] ) ) , the above equation says that if the ratio between the difference of the field at infinity and inside the body and the gravitational potential is small , @xmath62 is of order @xmath59 .",
    "this regime has been called the _ thin ",
    "shell regime_. it is realised when @xmath63 the new force leads to a modification to newton s law outside the body @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 which is suppressed @xmath67 despite being extremely light , the chameleon field does not generate a measurable fifth force .",
    "this results springs from the smallness of @xmath68 , i.e. the thin ",
    "shell regime .    to conclude , in the case @xmath42",
    "we have found that , like in the original chameleon model , the thin  shell regime may exist .",
    "we will see that in the case @xmath43 , the thin  shell regime does not exist .",
    "let us repeat the same analysis for @xmath43 . in the range @xmath69 we find that @xmath0 is a combination of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "matching at @xmath62 leads to @xmath72 implying that @xmath73 .",
    "thus , there is no thin  shell regime , even inside big , heavy bodies .    demanding that the first derivative vanishes at the origin , the solution inside the body can be found to be @xmath74 where @xmath75 . outside the body , the solution reads @xmath76 matching both solutions and their first derivative at @xmath77 and noting that @xmath78 and @xmath79 as @xmath80 one obtains @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the cosmological value of the field now , i.e. the value of the field far away from the body .",
    "thus , away from the body , the profile is given by @xmath83 leading to a force @xmath84 which is nothing but a correction to newton s law with @xmath85 thus , in the case with @xmath86 , the effective coupling between scalar field and matter is not specified by @xmath41 alone , _ it is also determined by the cosmological value of the field itself . _ experiments constrain @xmath87 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this implies that the value of the field at infinity , determined by the cosmological dynamics , must be extremely small .",
    "we will briefly discuss the case @xmath88 .",
    "the solution inside the body reads @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "this solution is only valid when @xmath31 is even , the @xmath91th root taking alternative signs .",
    "notice first that this solution can not match a constant between @xmath62 and @xmath59 .",
    "hence there is no thin  shell and the above solution is valid all the way to the origin .",
    "at the origin the field diverges and the force behaves like @xmath92 it is repulsive and infinite at the origin implying that the compact spherical object would not exist .    in conclusion , only @xmath93 are sustainable cases .",
    "whereas the case @xmath42 allows for a thin  shell regime , the case @xmath43 does not have this propery .",
    "the case @xmath94 is pathological and does not lead to physical acceptable results .",
    "let us now turn our attention to a scalar  tensor theory motivated from the brane world idea . in what follows , we will in particular focus on the radion field , i.e. the interbrane distance",
    "let us first concentrate on two - brane models with a bulk scalar field ( for details , see e.g. see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . at low energy",
    "the model is described by a tensor ",
    "scalar field theory with two massless scalar fields , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , related to the scale factor in the bulk @xmath97 @xmath98 where @xmath99 are the brane coordinates and @xmath100 for @xmath101 , the second field @xmath96 decouples and we obtain the randall - sundrum model @xcite with a single field @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the interbrane distance , i.e. the radion , and @xmath104 measures the curvature scale of the bulk space time . however , even if @xmath105 we will still call @xmath95 the radion field .    in the bulk , the scale factor behaves like @xmath106 showing that there is a would ",
    "be singularity when @xmath107 beyond the second brane . when coupled to matter , the cosmological evolution drives @xmath95 to zero , i.e. the second brane hits the would ",
    "be singularity @xcite .",
    "this situation can be avoided by introducing a potential @xmath108 shielding @xmath109 .",
    "such a run  away potential can be chosen to be like @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the allowed range . as we assume that @xmath96 is still massless , solar system experiments",
    "imply that @xmath112 , i.e. the randall  sundrum limit . in that case",
    "the coupling of the field @xmath95 to matter is well specified by the function @xcite @xmath113 in the randall - sundrum case , there are two relevant regimes .",
    "when @xmath114 , the distance between the branes is small @xmath115 ( i.e. the distance is smaller than the bulk curvature length scale ) .",
    "changing @xmath116 , the coupling becomes then @xmath117 in that case , we retrieve the original example of a chameleon field corresponding for @xmath118 and @xmath119 to a linear coupling with @xmath42 .",
    "hence the radion possesses then a thin  shell .",
    "this situation has been studied at length in @xcite .",
    "now there is another interesting regime when @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( i.e. interbrane distances larger than the bulk curvature scale ) , where we can approximate @xmath122 and we have taken @xmath123 .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath124 in equation ( [ coupling ] ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath125 is small enough with a runaway potential of the form ( [ poti ] ) , we end up with a theory in which the thin  shell regime does not exist even for heavy bodies .",
    "cosmology has to ensure that the field is small today and fullfills nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "we will therefore now discuss the cosmology of the radion field with a potential energy of the form ( [ poti ] ) and therefore get an estimate of @xmath38 , which determines the coupling to matter locally ( see eq .",
    "( [ radioncoupling ] ) ) .",
    "in this section , we will switch notation and will denote the radion field as @xmath0 .",
    "we will discuss the different cosmological epochs separately . before imposing the local constraints ,",
    "however , we will discuss the cosmological evolution in general .",
    "let us consider first an inflationary era in order to find the initial conditions for the radion field in the radiation dominated epoch .",
    "for the inflationary model , we choose a chaotic inflationary potential of the form @xmath126 where @xmath127 has dimension one .",
    "we assume that the inflaton field @xmath127 is confined on the positive tension brane .",
    "then , in the einstein frame , its mass depends on the moduli fields through a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "the klein ",
    "gordon equation for the field @xmath0 reads @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the trace of the energy momentum tensor of @xmath127 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the field @xmath0 are governed by an effective potential @xmath130 where we have neglected the kinetic energy of @xmath127 as the field is assumed to slow  roll . during inflation , @xmath131 is almost constant .",
    "the minimum of the effective potential is given by @xmath132 and the effective mass of the @xmath0 field at the minimum is @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "this large mass guarantees that the effective potential for @xmath0 is very steep around its minimum and @xmath0 decays rapidly towards the minimum .",
    "thus , just before the end of inflation , @xmath0 sits at the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "notice that the value of @xmath0 is tiny , as @xmath135 is small .",
    "we will assume that the field @xmath0 is a fundamental field and therefore that the inflaton field does only decay into radiation , the standard model particles and dark matter .",
    "thus , during reheating no energy will be released into the field @xmath0 and therefore during reheating the field remains small .",
    "this provides a hint about the initial value of the radion at the beginning of the radiation epoch .",
    "let us consider now the cases of the radiation and matter dominated epochs .",
    "the klein ",
    "gordon for the radion equation reads @xmath136 that is , the effective potential reads @xmath137 the field value at the minimum is given by @xmath138 because the field is small , we have that @xmath139 now we can consider two cases during radiation domination : either the fields starts at @xmath140 or at @xmath141 .",
    "assume that the field value is larger than the minimum .",
    "then we can neglect the potential and the field is governed by @xmath142 this is the equation of an damped oscillator . because the mass is much smaller than the hubble parameter ,",
    "the field is overdamped and does not move .",
    "only if @xmath143 drops below the mass the field starts to evolve and moves towards the minimum .",
    "let us consider now the case that @xmath144 .",
    "if the potential energy is initially very large , the field rolls down and becomes kinetically dominated ( @xmath145 is the initial fraction of energy stored in the radion field ) ( see also @xcite ) @xmath146 with an equation of state @xmath147 .",
    "it stops at @xmath148 with an equation of state @xmath149 .",
    "this can be seen in figure 3 where a plateau is reached before converging to the attractor ( in planck units ) @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath152 corresponding to the usual ratra ",
    "peebles attractor @xcite .    in the matter dominated era , the minimum of the effective potential is located at @xmath153 the mass at the minimum ( @xmath154 ) is then @xmath155 in planck units .",
    "the klein ",
    "gordon equation has an attractor @xmath156 implying that @xmath157 notice that @xmath158 .",
    "the field follows the minimum but does not settle at the minimum ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the equation of state reads @xmath159 which is smaller than in the radiation dominated era .",
    "we have numerically solved the equations and compared it to the ordinary quintessence model in general relativity .",
    "the results are shown in figures 1 , 2 and 3 .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the evolution of the equation of state as a function of @xmath160 for the case of @xmath161 and the same initial conditions .",
    "we compare the brane theory together with a quintessence model in general relativity .",
    "as can be seen , the evolution of the equation of state around @xmath162 is more pronounced in general relativity than in the brane model .",
    "furthermore , the equation of state is smaller in the brane scenario than in general relativity .    in figure 2",
    "we show the dependence of the equation of state @xmath163 as a function of @xmath164 .",
    "it can be seen that in general relativity this dependence is stronger than in the brane model .",
    "finally , in figure 3 we plot the evolution of the radion field ( in planck units ) as a function of @xmath160 for different initial conditions . as can be seen",
    ", the field evolves according to the solution ( [ kgsolution1 ] ) in the radiation dominated epoch and according to ( [ kgsolution2 ] ) in the matter dominated epoch .",
    "the discussion on the cosmological evolution so far did not take into account the constraints imposed by local experiments .",
    "in fact , if the radion field acts as dark energy , its evolution is similar to a field with inverse power  law potential in general relativity . in particular , for @xmath165 , the field value today",
    "is of order the planck mass .",
    "this , however , is not compatible with local experiments . imposing that @xmath166 leads to @xmath167 ev and @xmath168 .",
    "the potential is extremely flat and peaked sharply around @xmath169 .",
    "thus , for the potential considered here the price to be paid is that , at least for the standard potential used here , the parameters have to be extremely fine  tuned , if the radion should play the role of dark energy .",
    "so far we have focused on a particular inverse power law potential , in which @xmath170 for @xmath171 . in the following",
    "we will consider another class of potentials leading to an interesting cosmology with no conflict with local experiments .",
    "the potential is not a quintessential potential , however , but has the form @xmath172 where @xmath173 ev in order to trigger acceleration now .",
    "it is not a quintessence potential per se as it does not converge to zero at infinity .",
    "it should be considered as a very flat potential which may appear from some non - perturbative physics for the radion .",
    "as we will now see , such a potential leads to acceleration and drives the field towards very small values ( @xmath174 ) .    for the potential above ,",
    "the minimum of the effective potential is given by @xmath175 for @xmath176 this leads to @xmath177 notice that @xmath178 for @xmath179 implying that solar tests are automatically satisfied .",
    "let us discuss the cosmology of this model .",
    "the mass of the radion at the minimum reads @xmath180.\\ ] ] there are two regimes . when @xmath181 , the mass is very large @xmath182 implying that the minimum acts as an attractor .",
    "when @xmath183 , the potential reads @xmath184 where @xmath185 now as long as @xmath19 is subdominant , the constant term is irrelevant and we retrieve the analysis of the power law potential .",
    "this implies that in the radiation and matter dominated eras , the radion follows the attractors that we found previously .",
    "only the early universe is modified .",
    "we have seen that @xmath186 and therefore solar tests are satisfied .",
    "what about laboratory tests of the equivalence principle ?",
    "let us consider the gravity experiments in a cavity of radius @xmath187 .",
    "inside the vacuum chamber the field is early constant and determined by @xmath188 i.e. the compton wavelength of the radion is then given by @xmath187 .",
    "moreover the field in the cavity is larger than the field outside the cavity implying that @xmath189 inside the cavity , a gradient of @xmath0 leads to a new force acting on particles and a breaking of the equivalence principle to the accuracy level @xmath190 imposing that @xmath191 @xcite leads to @xmath192 which is always satisfied .    to conclude this section , for a potential of the form ( [ champot ] )",
    "the mass scale has to be chosen such that @xmath193  ev if the radion is to be a dark energy candidate .",
    "this tuning is no more than that required by a cosmological constant .",
    "in this paper , the chameleon mechanism has been investigated in the case of field dependent couplings .",
    "such couplings arise naturally in theories with extra dimensions , such as brane world scenarios . in theories with constant couplings a thin  shell regime exists , in which the deviations from general relativity are suppressed .",
    "we have shown , that this is not true in models with field  dependent couplings . in these models",
    "shell regime does not exist ( i.e. no suppression of the couplings ) and , hence , there are potentially large deviations from general relativity .    using the low - energy effective action , we have considered the cosmology of the radion field at large distances on the branes ( or low energy ) .",
    "possible deviations from general relativity due to the smallness of the radion mass were investigated .",
    "two regimes can be distinguished , leading to the thin and thick shell properties . at short distances between the branes ,",
    "the radion satisfies the thin - shell property and no deviation can be detected either on earth or in solar system experiments .",
    "satellites experiments would be able to detect large deviations from gravity . for large distances between the branes , the thin - shell property is replaced by a thick  shell regime . in this case deviations from normal gravity",
    "are small provided that the cosmological value of the radion is small enough .",
    "we have investigated a class of potentials for which the radion ( at large distances between the branes ) can both act as quintessence and satisfies gravity tests .",
    "unfortunately , future satellite experiments would not notice the presence of the radion as the coupling in that case is too small .    if the branes are close together , the model and its cosmology are similar to the original chameleon model @xcite , local constraints are satisfied and the radion can also act as a dark energy candidate . in this case ,",
    "future satellite experiments could detect the predicted deviations from general relativity .",
