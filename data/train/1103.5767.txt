    "the thermal spectra of neutron stars during thermonuclear x - ray bursts have been used during the last three decades in numerous attempts to measure the neutron - star masses and radii ( e.g. , van paradijs 1978 , 1979 ; foster , fabian & ross 1986 ; sztajno et al .",
    "1987 ; van paradijs & lewin 1987 ; damen et al .   1989 , 1990 ) .",
    "such efforts were often hampered by large systematic uncertainties in the estimated distances to the bursters and in the theoretical models for their x - ray spectra .",
    "moreover , the relatively small number of x - ray bursts observed by early satellites from each individual source made it impossible to assess systematic uncertainties related to the degree of anisotropy of the thermonuclear burning on the neutron - star surface , or of the obscuration by and the reflection off the accretion flow .",
    "the situation has changed dramatically in the last few years .",
    "the distances to several globular clusters that contain bursting neutron stars has been narrowed down with the use of observations by the hubble space telescope ( see , e.g. , kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 ; zel , gver , & psaltis 2009 ; gver et al .",
    "the distances to x - ray bursters in the galactic disk and halo have also been determined using alternate methods ( e.g. , gver et al .",
    "theoretical models of the x - ray spectra of bursting neutron stars have been greatly improved and can account for the subtle effects of the presence of heavy metals in their atmospheres ( e.g. , london , taam , & howard 1986 ; foster , fabian , & ross 1986 ; ebisuzaki 1987 ; madej , joss , & raska 2004 ; majczyna et al .",
    "2005 ; suleimanov , poutanen , & werner 2011 ) . finally , the high signal - to - noise observations of the x - ray spectra of several hundreds of bursts with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( galloway et al .",
    "2008a ) allow for the formal uncertainties of individual measurements to be substantially reduced .",
    "the combination of these developments led recently to the measurement of the masses and radii of several neutron stars ( zel et al .",
    "2009 ; gver et al .  2010a , 2010b ;",
    "steiner , lattimer , & brown 2010 ) which are already sufficient to provide broad constraints on the equation of state of neutron - star matter ( zel , baym , & gver 2010 ) . in some cases , the formal uncertainties in the spectroscopic measurements are as low as a few percent ( gver et al .",

    ", we focus on the measurements of the apparent surface areas of 12 neutron stars as inferred from their x - ray spectra during the cooling tails of the bursts .",
    "our goal is to quantify the degree to which : _ ( i ) _ the x - ray burst spectra observed in the rxte energy range can be described by blackbody functions ( the so - called color correction arising from atmospheric effects are then applied a posteriori ) ; _ ( ii ) _ the entire surface area of each neutron star burns practically uniformly during the cooling of the bursts ; _ ( iii ) _ the accretion flows make minor contributions to the emission during the bursts .",

    "( in a few cases , data gaps during the observations result in x - ray spectra integrated over shorter exposure times ) .",
    "we took the spectrum over a 16  s time interval prior to the onset of each burst as the spectrum of the persistent emission , which we subtracted from the burst spectra as background .",
    "we generated separate response matrix files for each burst using the pcarsp version 11.7 , heasoft release 6.7 , and heasarc s remote calibration database and took into account the offset pointing of the pca during the creation of the response matrix files .",
    "this latest version of the pca response matrix makes the instrument calibration self - consistent over the pca lifetime and yields a normalization of the crab pulsar that is within 1@xmath16 of the calibration measurement of toor & seward ( 1974 ) for that source . in  4 ,",
    "we discuss in some detail the effect of the uncertainties in the absolute flux calibration on the measurement of the apparent surface area of neutron stars . finally , we corrected all of the x - ray spectra for pca deadtime following the method suggested by the rxte team .",
    "to analyze the spectra , we used the interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ) , version 1.4.9 - 55 ( houck & denicola 2000 ) . for each fit , we included a systematic error of 0.5% as suggested by the rxte calibration team .",
    "we fit each spectrum with a blackbody function using the _ bbodyrad _ model ( as defined in xspec , arnaud 1996 ) and multiplied it by the _ tbabs _ model ( wilms , allen , & mccray 2000 ) that takes into account the interstellar extinction , assuming ism abundances .",
    "the model of the x - ray spectrum for each burst , therefore , depends on only three parameters : the color temperature of the blackbody , @xmath17 , the normalization of the blackbody spectrum , @xmath18 , and the equivalent hydrogen column density , @xmath19 of the interstellar extinction .    allowing the hydrogen column density @xmath19 to be a free parameter in the fitting procedure leads to correlated uncertainties between the amount of interstellar extinction and the temperature of the blackbody .",
    "moreover , for every 10@xmath20  @xmath21 overestimation ( underestimation ) of the column density , the inferred flux of the thermal emission is systematically larger ( smaller ) by @xmath22  10@xmath23  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath24  ( galloway et al .",
    "reducing the uncertainties related to the interstellar extinction for each burster is , therefore , very important in controlling systematic effects .",
    "a recent analysis of high resolution grating spectra from a number of x - ray binaries ( miller , cackett , & reis 2009 ) showed that the individual photoelectric absorption edges observed in the x - ray spectra do not show significant variations with source luminosity or spectral state .",
    "this result strongly suggests that the neutral hydrogen column density is dominated by absorption in the interstellar medium and does not change on short timescales . in order to reduce this systematic uncertainty and given the fact that there is no evidence of variable neutral absorption for each system , we fixed the hydrogen column density for each source to a constant value that we obtained in one of the following ways . _",

    "j1750.8@xmath12900 ) there are no independent hydrogen column density measurements published in the literature . in these cases",
    ", we fit the x - ray spectra obtained during all the x - ray bursts of each source allowing the n@xmath25 value to vary in a wide range .",
    "we then found the resulting mean value of n@xmath25 and used this as a constant in our second set of fits to all the x - ray bursts . in table",
    "[ sourcestable ] , we show the adopted values for the hydrogen column density together with the measurement uncertainties , the method with which the values were estimated , and the appropriate references . future observations of these sources with x - ray grating spectrometers onboard chandra and xmm@xmath1_newton _ can help decrease the uncertainty arising from the lack of knowledge of the properties of the interstellar matter towards these sources .",
    "our goal in this article is to study potential systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the apparent area of each neutron star during the cooling tails of x - ray bursts .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the following working definition of the cooling tail .",
    "it is the time interval during which the inferred flux is lower than the peak flux of the burst or the touchdown flux for photospheric radius expansion bursts . for the purpose of this definition , we use as a touchdown point the first moment at which the blackbody temperature reaches its highest value and the inferred apparent radius is lowest . in order to control the countrate statistics",

    "we discuss in detail our approach of quantifying the systematic uncertainties in the measurements of the apparent radii during the cooling tails of thermonuclear bursts , using the sources ks  1731@xmath1260 , 4u  1728@xmath134 , and 4u  1636@xmath1536 as case studies . for another analysis of the cooling tails of x - ray bursts from 4u  1636@xmath1536 ,",
    "see zhang , mendez , & altamirano ( 2011 ) . in  5 , we repeat this procedure systematically for seven additional sources from table  [ sourcestable ] .",
    "finally , the cooling tails of the bursts observed from 4u  0513@xmath140 and aql  x-1 show irregular behavior , and we report our analysis of them in the appendix .",
    "our first working hypothesis is that the spectra of neutron stars during the cooling tails of thermonuclear bursts can be modeled by blackbody functions in the observed energy range .",
    "the fact that x - ray spectra can be described well with blackbody functions has been established since the first time resolved x - ray spectral studies of thermonuclear bursts ( see , e.g. , swank et al .",
    "1977 ; lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ; galloway et al .  2008a and",
    "references therein ) . under that assumption ,",
    "the temperature measured by fitting blackbodies to the spectra are then corrected for the effects of the atmosphere by applying a numerical prefactor called the color correction factor @xmath28 , which is the ratio of the color to the effective temperature .",
    "this approach is expected to be only an approximation for a number of reasons .",
    "first , theoretical models of the atmospheres of neutron stars in radiative equilibrium invariably show that the emerging spectra are broader than blackbodies , especially at low temperatures and towards low photon energies ( e.g. , madej et al .",
    "2004 ; majczyna et al .",
    "moreover , for neutron stars that are rapidly spinning , the spectra measured by an observer at infinity will be broader and more asymmetric with respect to those at the stellar surface ( zel & psaltis 2003 ) . the expected degree of broadening and asymmetry will be at most comparable to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the spin frequency of the neutron star and @xmath31 is its radius . this is an uncertainty that can , in principle , be corrected for by fitting the x - ray data with theoretical models of the x - ray spectra emerging from the atmospheres of rapidly spinning neutron stars .",
    "second , the accretion flow in the vicinity of the neutron star may alter in a number of ways the observed spectrum .",
    "it may act as a mirror , reflecting a fraction of the emerging radiation towards the observer and , therefore , increasing the apparent surface area of emission .",
    "it might occult a fraction of the stellar surface , reducing the apparent surface area of emission ( see galloway et al .",
    "if the accretion flow is surrounded by a hot corona , comptonization of the surface emission will alter its spectrum as well as the relation between energy flux and apparent surface area ( e.g. , boutloukos , miller , & lamb 2010 ) .",
    "finally , the residual emission of the accretion flow , which we attempt to remove by subtracting the pre - burst spectrum of the source , might change during the duration of the burst , introducing systematic changes in the net spectrum .",
    "all of the above effects have the potential of changing the shape of the x - ray spectrum of a burster and , perhaps more importantly , lead to stochastic changes in the inferred apparent radii . their overall effect ,",
    "however , is expected to be significantly reduced by the fact that the intense radiation field during each x - ray burst should either disrupt the inner accretion flow or cool any corona to the compton temperature of the radiation .",
    "such a phenomenon has been observed during a superburst from 4u  1820@xmath130 ( ballantyne & strohmayer 2004 ) .",
    "moreover , these effects are expected to be the strongest for high inclination systems ( as was inferred by , e.g. , galloway et al.2008b ) .",
    "this is why we not only limited our sample to bursts for which the ratio of the persistent flux prior to the burst to the eddington flux @xmath32 in order to minimize accretion - related uncertainties but also selected the known high inclination sources out of our sample ( see  2 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : chi2 ] shows that the resulting @xmath34 distributions can be well approximated by the @xmath33 distribution but have weak tails extending to higher values .",

    "indeed , any component of the variation in the surface temperature that is not symmetric with respect to the rotation axis leads to oscillations of the observed flux at the spin frequency of the neutron star .",

    "all of the above strongly suggest that the expected flux anisotropy during the cooling tail of an x - ray burst is @xmath51% and , therefore , the expected systematic uncertainties in the inferred apparent stellar radius will be half of that value , since the latter scales as the square root of the flux .     on the color temperature of the x - ray spectrum for two sequences of models by madej et al .",

    "moreover , in the appendix we also discuss a number of bursts from 4u  1702@xmath1429 and a long burst from 4u  1724@xmath1307 , which we did not include in the analysis .    as in the case of the three sources discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the vast majority of the spectra observed during the cooling tails of x - ray bursts are very well described by blackbody functions , with only marginal allowance for systematic variations . in the flux - temperature diagrams ,",
    "the cooling tails largely follow a well defined and reproducible track .",
    "finally , in each flux interval of most sources , the range of blackbody normalizations obtained from a large number of bursts is consistent with a small degree of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measurements of the average blackbody normalizations in all sources are dominated by systematic uncertainties ( the main exception is 4u  1735@xmath144 ) . however , these uncertainties are small , ranging from @xmath44% in the case of 4u  1702@xmath1429 to @xmath110% in the case of 4u  1636@xmath1536 .",
    "the apparent radius of each neutron star scales as the square root of the blackbody normalization . as a result ,",
    "the errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron - star radii introduced by systematic effects in the cooling tails of x - ray bursts are in the range @xmath0% ( see table  [ radii_table ] ) .",
    "such small errors by themselves do not preclude distinguishing between different equations of state of neutron - star matter .",
    "a total of 46 bursts have been observed from the source 4u  1702@xmath1429 .",
    "six of these bursts reach high fluxes and have been categorized as photospheric radius expansion bursts by galloway et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "the remaining 40 bursts typically reach lower fluxes . in the main body of this paper , we focused on the 6 bright bursts from this source and exclude the remaining for two reasons that we explore in this appendix .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig:1702_appendix ] shows the histogram of @xmath33/dof values for the 880 spectra observed during the cooling tails of the 40 bursts and compares them to the expected distribution given the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is evident that blackbody functions provide statistically unacceptable fits to the majority of the spectra .",
    "had we not considered these spectra unacceptable , we would find that , approximately 4 seconds after the bursts start , the inferred blackbody normalizations increase rapidly to large values .",
    "the increase in normalization is , in fact , correlated with an increase in the @xmath111/dof values , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig:1702_appendix ] , rendering them even more suspect .",
    "these two arguments strongly suggest that the spectra of the 40 weak x - ray bursts from 4u  1702@xmath1429 are not dominated by the thermal emission from the neutron star .",
    "the first x - ray burst observed from 4u  1724@xmath1307 on 1996 november 08 during observation 10090 - 01 - 01 - 02 is very different compared to the other two x - ray bursts that we used in the main text .",
    "the first burst is unusually long ( @xmath112  s ) , while the other two bursts are much shorter ( @xmath113  s range , as is typical for the vast majority of the type - i bursts observed ) .",
    "moreover , while the spectra of the short bursts are accurately modeled with blackbody functions ( see top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : radii1 ] ) , fitting the spectra during the cooling tail of the long burst results in unacceptably large values of @xmath33/dof and the distritubiton of the resulting @xmath33/dof values do not follow the expected @xmath33 distribution ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1724_appendix ] ) . adding a certain amount of systematic uncertainty to the data can in principle result in a decrease in the individual @xmath33/dof values ; however , it can not change the fact that the resulting @xmath33/dof distribution does not follow the expected distribution .",
    "if we went ahead and further analyzed these statistically unacceptable spectra , we would have obtained values for the blackbody normalization that are larger compared to those of the shorter bursts ( see right panel of fig .  [ fig:1724_appendix ] ) .",
    "the large values and the seemingly random distribution of @xmath33/dof suggest that the x - ray spectra in the cooling tail of the long burst from 4u  1724@xmath1307 are not dominated by the thermal emission from the neutron star .",
    "in fact , int zand & weinberg ( 2010 ) found evidence for atomic edges and a reflection component in the spectra of this burst , which they attributed to the presence of heavy metals in the ashes of previous bursts that were exposed by the long radius - expansion episode . for these reasons , we excluded the long x - ray burst observed from 4u  1724@xmath1307 from our analysis .",
    "note that suleimanov et al.(2011 ) chose the spectra from this burst in order to infer the mass and radius of the neutron star in 4u  1724@xmath1307 .",
    "had they chosen the other two bursts from the same source , the spectra of which are actually well described by blackbody functions , they would have obtained a radius of the neutron star that is @xmath114% smaller , making their result consistent with the radii inferred for the other sources using this method ( zel et al .",
    "2009 ; gver et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ) as well as with radii inferred from quiescent neutron stars in globular clusters ( e.g. , webb & barret 2007 ; guillot , rutledge , & brown 2010 ) .",
    "six bursts have been observed from the source 4u  0513@xmath140 . while most of the x - ray spectra during the cooling tails of these bursts can be described well by blackbody functions ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:0514 ] ) , the flux - temperature diagrams show irregular behaviour for the cooling tails ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:0514 ] ) .",
    "in particular , two of the bursts show a cooling tail that is reminiscent of the long burst from 4u  1724@xmath1307 discussed above : early in the cooling phase the temperature of the blackbody decreases while the flux remains constant and , when the flux starts decreasing , the cooling occurs with blackbody normalizations that are on average larger compared to the other bursts .",
    "it is plausible that the spectra of these bursts from 4u  0513@xmath140 are also affected by the presence of atomic lines , but the relatively low flux of 4u  0513@xmath140 ( which is a factor of @xmath115 smaller compared to that of 4u  1724@xmath1307 at similar temperatures ) still allows us to fit the observed spectra with blackbody functions .",
    "we do not consider this source suitable for a radius measurement based on the burst data .",
    "the transient source aql  x-1 has shown 51 x - ray bursts , from which we extracted 2191 spectra .",
    "most of these spectra are well fit by blackbody functions , but their cooling tracks in the flux - temperature diagram depend strongly on the properties of the bursts ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aqlx1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , a large number of bursts are relatively short and reach modest fluxes ( typically @xmath116  erg  s@xmath24  @xmath21 ) with cooling tracks in the flux - temperature diagram that are reproducible . on the other hand , many bursts , which are relatively longer , reach fluxes that are a factor of @xmath117 higher , are often characterized by radius expansion episodes , and follow a range of cooling tracks in the flux - temperature diagram with blackbody normalizations that are typically larger than those of the other bursts .",
    "one plausible exlanation is related to the fraction of the neutron star surface that is engulfed by the thermonuclear flash . in weak flashes",
    ", the burning front may not propage across the entire surface and , therefore , only a fraction of the stellar surface contributes to the normalization of the blackbody . on the other hand , in stronger flashes , a larger fraction of the neutron star surface is covered .",
    "the source aql  x-1 is one of the two main examples ( the other being the source 4u  1636@xmath1536 ) discussed by bhattacharrya et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as evidence for systematic variations in the burning area during thermonuclear x - ray bursts .",
    "it is important to emphasize here , however , that the case of aql  x-1 is very unusual compared to the remaining sources that we analyzed and is , perhaps , related to the presence of a weak but dynamically important magnetic field in this source , as inferred from the observation of intermittent persistent pulsations ( casella et al .",
