    "the value of the @xmath17-@xmath13 mixing angle in the pseudoscalar meson nonet , @xmath18 , has been discussed extensively over the last 35 years , and is today one of the most interesting su(3)-breaking hadronic parameters to measure @xcite . in the context of chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "it has been demonstrated that a description of the @xmath17-@xmath13 system beyond leading order can not be achieved in terms of just one mixing angle @xcite .",
    "however , in the flavor basis the two mixing angles are equal , apart from terms which violate the ozi - rule ; thus working in this basis it is still possible to use a single mixing angle , @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath12 of the two branching ratios @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be related to the @xmath17-@xmath13 mixing angle in the flavor basis @xcite and to the gluonium content of the @xmath13 meson @xcite .    in this work we present a measurement of @xmath12 obtained using an integrated luminosity of @xmath20  pb@xmath21 collected by kloe during the years 20012002 .",
    "the best measurement available to date was also published by kloe @xcite , and was obtained from the analysis of the @xmath1 decay with the @xmath22 final state and the @xmath2 decay with the @xmath23 final state .",
    "the earlier kloe measurement was based on an integrated luminosity of about @xmath24 @xmath25 , collected during the year 2000 .",
    "previous measurements were performed by the snd and cmd-2 collaborations @xcite .",
    "the frascati @xmath7 factory da8ne  is an @xmath26 collider running at a center - of - mass energy @xmath27 gev , where @xmath7 mesons are produced with the beams colliding at a small crossing angle ( 25 mrad ) .",
    "the kloe detector consists of two main subdetectors : a large cylindrical drift chamber @xcite and a sampling lead / scintillating - fiber electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "a superconducting coil surrounding the calorimeter provides a solenoidal field of 0.52 t.    the drift chamber is 3.3 m in length and has a 2 m radius ; it has full stereo geometry and operates with a gas mixture of @xmath28 helium@xmath29 isobutane .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath30 ; the spatial resolution is @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "vertices are reconstructed with a spatial resolution of @xmath35 @xmath34 .",
    "the calorimeter is divided into a barrel and two endcaps ; it surrounds the drift chamber and covers @xmath36 of the solid angle .",
    "the calorimeter is segmented into @xmath37 cells of cross section @xmath38 @xmath39 in the plane perpendicular to the fibers .",
    "each cell is read out at both ends by photomultiplier tubes .",
    "particle arrival times and the three - dimensional positions of the energy deposits are obtained from the signals collected at the two ends ; cells close in time and space are grouped into a calorimeter cluster .",
    "the cluster energy @xmath40 is the sum of the cell energies , while the cluster time @xmath41 and position @xmath42 are energy - weighted averages .",
    "the probability for a photon to fragment into two or more clusters ( splitting ) is taken into account during event reconstruction by a dedicated procedure .",
    "the energy resolution is @xmath43 ; the timing resolution is @xmath44 ps @xmath45 ps . the kloe trigger @xcite is based on calorimeter and chamber information .",
    "the analysis has been performed using a sample of @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath7 mesons collected in 20012002 .",
    "we search for two categories of events .",
    "the first , @xmath46 , is produced through two different decay chains : @xmath47 the second , @xmath48 , is produced through @xmath49 the latter channel is used for normalization of the rates and is practically background free @xcite .",
    "processes with @xmath50 , where the @xmath51 decays near the beam interaction point ( ip ) can mimic the final state with @xmath52 because of the presence of an additional photon due either to machine background or split clusters .",
    "the most important decay chains of this type are the following : @xmath53 in particular , the last of these channels has the same final state used to identify @xmath54 .",
    "backgrounds from other sources are negligible .",
    "all events must pass a first - level selection ( fls ) @xcite , consisting of a machine background filter and an event selection procedure that assigns events into categories .",
    "after the fls , we select @xmath55 ( normalization ) events by requiring the presence of seven clusters not associated to tracks",
    ". each cluster must have @xmath56 mev and polar angle @xmath57 with respect to the beam direction , in order to exclude the focusing quadrupoles .",
    "each cluster time must be compatible with the hypothesis of a photon coming from the ip , so that the requirement to be satisfied is @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the cluster time and position and @xmath61 is the time resolution .",
    "we further require that no tracks come from the interaction region . to select @xmath54 events , we similarly require seven prompt photons ; in addition , we require the presence of a vertex formed by two tracks of opposite charge within a cylindrical region @xmath62 and @xmath63 around the ip . after applying these selections",
    ", we perform a kinematic fit requiring energy - momentum conservation , and times and path lengths to be consistent with the speed of light for photon candidates .",
    "we perform an inclusive measurement of the two different decay chains contributing to the @xmath54 process .",
    "the background is significantly reduced by the event - classification cuts in the fls , which efficiently identify @xmath64 decays . by selecting events classified only as pure radiative decays ,",
    "the @xmath65 backgrounds are largely reduced . after this",
    "cut , background from processes ( [ bg1 ] ) and ( [ bg3 ] ) above is practically negligible , while to further reduce background from process ( [ bg2 ] ) , we require @xmath66 for each of the seven clusters , where the improved estimates of the cluster energies from the kinematic fit are used to evaluate this cut .    to estimate the absolute number of residual background events , the number of @xmath7 mesons in the sample has been evaluated .",
    "we obtain @xmath67 , where the uncertainty comes from the estimate of the integrated luminosity and the experimentally - determined value of the leptonic decay width of the @xmath7 .",
    "the luminosity is known with a total error of @xmath68 @xcite , while the leptonic width has been measured by kloe with a @xmath69 uncertainty @xcite",
    ".    for each background channel , table  [ tabef ] lists the branching ratio multiplied by the overall selection efficiency as determined by monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the branching ratio for process ( [ bg3 ] ) has been evaluated using @xmath70 , for @xmath71 mev@xmath72 @xcite , the same cut used for our analysis .",
    "residual background due to multiphoton final states with a photon conversion and production of a charged - particle vertex has been reduced to a negligible level by a cut on the opening angle of the two tracks .",
    "requiring @xmath73 @xcite leads to a small effect on the signal efficiency and gives rise to a negligible contribution to the systematic error .",
    ".branching ratios times selection efficiencies @xmath74 and event yield for @xmath75 backgrounds [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    the solution in the hypothesis of no gluonium content , i.e. @xmath76 , yields @xmath77 .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is @xmath79 , corresponding to a probability of 0.01 , and suggests a possible non - zero value for @xmath80 .",
    "the solution allowing for gluonium is @xmath81 and @xmath82 , from which @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which means @xmath85 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath86 , for a probability of 0.49 . when the constraint from @xmath87 decay is relaxed ,",
    "similar results are obtained : @xmath88 and @xmath89 , while the @xmath90 probability improves to 0.97 .",
    "figure  [ glue1 ] shows the four constraints in the @xmath91 plane , together with the allowed region for the solution with gluonium .    in the octet - singlet basis ,",
    "the value of the @xmath17-@xmath13 mixing angle @xmath83 becomes @xmath92 , which is in agreement with the value @xmath93 measured by bes - ii @xcite using the branching fractions @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "these results for @xmath19 are consistent with those coming from other processes as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which quotes an average value @xmath96 .",
    "analyzing about @xmath97 @xmath7 mesons collected by kloe at the da8ne  collider , we have obtained a precise new measurement of the ratio @xmath98 . from this measurement",
    ", we obtain the most precise value of the pseudoscalar mixing angle in the flavor basis : @xmath99 .",
    "allowing for gluonium in the @xmath13 , a fit to our result together with other measurements yields @xmath83 and a @xmath13 gluonium content of @xmath84 .",
