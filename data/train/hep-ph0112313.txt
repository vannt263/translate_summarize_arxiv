    "presently planned @xmath0 linear collider ( lc ) projects will operate at an initial center of mass system ( cms ) energy of about 500 gev , with upgrades to higher energies designed in from the start .",
    "the tev class colliders tesla  @xcite and nlc / jlc  @xcite target 800 gev and 1 - 1.5 tev , respectively , as their maximum cms energies . increasing the energy",
    "further would require either a change in acceleration technology or an extension in accelerator length beyond the presently foreseen 30 - 40 km  @xcite .",
    "this would also increase the number of active elements , which will likely decrease the overall efficiency of such a facility .",
    "the nature of the new physics which will hopefully be discovered and studied at the lhc and a tev class lc will determine the necessity and importance of exploring the multi - tev range with a precision machine such as an @xmath2 collider .",
    "this paper summarizes the work of the e3 subgroup 2 on multi - tev colliders of the snowmass 2001 workshop ` the future of particle physics ' .    based on our knowledge today",
    ", the case for the multi - tev collider rests on the following physics scenarios :    ( 200,1 ) ( 25,-357)_presented at the aps / dpf / dpb summer study on the future of particle physics ( snowmass 2001 ) , _ ( 120,-369)_30 june - 21 july 2001 , snowmass , colorado , usa _    *",
    "the study of the higgs + for a light higgs , a multi - tev @xmath2 collider can access with high precision the triple higgs coupling , providing experimenters with the opportunity to measure the higgs potential .",
    "the large event statistics will allow physicists to measure rare higgs decays such as @xmath3 .",
    "for heavy higgses , predicted by e.g. supersymmetric models , the range for discovery and measurement will be extended for masses up to and beyond 1 tev .",
    "* supersymmetry + in many susy scenarios only a subset of the new sparticles will be light enough to be produced directly at a tev class lc .",
    "some of the heavier sparticles will be discovered at the lhc , but a multi - tev lc will be needed to complete the spectrum and to precisely measure the heavy sparticles properties ( flavor , mass , width , couplings ) . furthermore , polarized beams will help disentangle mixing parameters and aid cp studies . ultimately we _ will _ need to measure all sparticles as precisely as possible to fully pin down and test the underlying theory .",
    "* new resonances + many alternative theories and models for new physics predict new heavy resonances with masses larger than 1 tev .",
    "if these new resonances ( e.g. new gauge bosons , kaluza - klein resonances , or @xmath4 resonances ) have masses in the 1  tev - 5  tev range , a multi - tev collider becomes a particle factory , similar to lep for the @xmath5 .",
    "the new particles can be produced directly and their properties can be accurately determined . *",
    "no new particles + if _ no _ new particles are observed directly , apart from perhaps one light higgs particle , then a multi - tev collider will probe new physics indirectly ( extra dimensions , @xmath6 , contact interactions ) at scales in the range of 30 - 400 tev via precision measurements . * unexpected phenomena +",
    "this is probably the most exciting of all : perhaps nature has chosen a road as yet not explored ( extensively ) by our imagination .",
    "recent examples of new ideas are string quantum gravity effects , non - commutative effects , black hole formation , nylons , and split fermions .",
    ".event rates for several processes in the multi - tev range , for 1 ab@xmath7 integrated luminosity . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sum ]",
    "linear @xmath0 colliders operating in the multi - tev energy range are likely to be based on the clic two - beam acceleration concept . to achieve a large luminosity",
    ", such an accelerator would need to operate in the high beamstrahlung region , rendering experimentation at such a collider more challenging .",
    "studies so far indicate that this is not a substantial handicap , and the precision physics expected from an @xmath0 collider will be possible .",
    "the two - beam accelerator technology is not yet available today for use at a large scale collider .",
    "r&d on this technology will continue until 2006 at least , after which  if no bad surprises emerge one can plan for a full technical design of such a collider .    from the physics program side",
    ", a multi - tev collider has a large potential to push back the high energy horizon further , up to scales of 1000 tev , where  if the higgs is light new physics can no longer hide from experiment . if no new scale is found by then we have to revise our understanding of nature",
    ".    a multi - tev collider with high luminosity can be used for precision measurements in the higgs sector .",
    "it can precisely measure the masses and couplings of heavy sparticles , thereby completing the susy spectrum .",
    "if extra dimensions or even black holes pop up in the multi - tev range , such a collider will be a precision instrument to study quantum gravity in the laboratory .",
    "the physics reach , as envisioned today , for a multi - tev collider is summarized in table  [ tab : sum ] . in short a collider with @xmath8  3 - 5  tev is expected to break new grounds , beyond the lhc and a tev class lc .        , desy  2001 - 011 .",
