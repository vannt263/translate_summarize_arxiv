    "[ table2]-[table3 ] numerical values of masses , vevs and @xmath1 are given at the same three scales for the mssm and 2hdm with @xmath84 and 55 in each of the two theories .",
    "as emphasized in this paper our high scale estimations predict quite significantly different values for the running masses especially in the up - quark sector .",
    "although the ckm matrices at high scales remain the same as in scale - independent assumptions on the vevs , the up - quark mass matrices are modified by the factor @xmath135 , but the down - quark and charged - lepton mass matrices are modified by the factor @xmath136 . in the mssm with @xmath88 and @xmath84 including running effect of the vevs , the gut scale predictions are @xmath137 mev , 200 mev , 73.5 gev ) as compared to @xcite @xmath138 mev , 302 mev , 129 gev ) . but by increasing the susy scale to @xmath89 tev and in the large @xmath1-region we find substantial decrease in the predicted values of the top - quark mass at the gut scale leading to @xmath139 mev , 210 mev , 95.1 gev ) .",
    "this is understood by noting that @xmath140 is closer to the perturbative limit for which the top - quark yukawa coupling is larger . similarly from table .",
    "[ table2 ] we note nearly a 20% increase in the @xmath141 with the increase of @xmath1 from @xmath142 .",
    "similar effects are also noted in 2hdm as can be seen from table .",
    "[ table3 ] where @xmath93 decreases by nearly 7% as @xmath1 increases from @xmath142 . for larger effect",
    "the increase has to be larger in @xmath1 since the perturbative limit in this case is closer to @xmath143 as compared to the mssm case where the limiting value is @xmath144 .",
    "in the frequently exploited renormalisation scheme in gauge theories , the yukawa couplings and vevs in the sm , 2hdm and mssm run separately @xcite .",
    "the effect of scale dependence of the vevs has been ignored while deriving analytic formulas @xcite and obtaining numerical predictions at higher scales for the running masses of fermions @xcite , but appropriately taken into account more recently @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have derived new analytic formulas in the sm and 2hdm and generalised the formulas of @xcite for any supersymmetry scale @xmath145 .",
    "the new formulas exhibit substantially different functional dependence on gauge and yukawa couplings in all the three effective theories .",
    "in particular , the running masses of the first two generations are found to be independent of yukawa couplings of the third generations in the small mixing limit .",
    "numerical predictions at two - loop level shows that all the running masses in the sm and only the up - quark masses in the mssm and 2hdm decrease at high scales when compared with the predictions taking scale - independent vevs .",
    "but in the case of mssm and 2hdm the down - quark and the charged - lepton masses increase over the corresponding predictions obtained with scale - independent assumptions on the vevs .",
    "compared to the mssm the perturbatively allowed region of @xmath1 is larger in 2hdm . in mssm",
    "the allowed region shows a slow increase with the susy scale .",
    "we have also made predictions of the running masses at the gut scale as a function of supersymmetry scale exhibiting new behaviours .",
    "we suggest that these new analytic formulas and improved estimations on the running masses and @xmath1 at high scales be used as inputs to test models proposing unified explanations of quark - lepton masses .",
