    "diffraction by an infinite wedge is a fundamental canonical problem in acoustic scattering .",

    "contour integral representations over so - called sommerfeld - malyuzhinets contours are better suited to far field computations ( e.g.  for deriving diffraction coefficients in computational methods such as the geometrical theory of diffraction @xcite ) .",
    "more recently it has been discovered that the ` diffracted ' component of these solutions ( precisely , that which remains after subtracting from the total field the geometrical acoustics terms ) can be expressed in a more physically intuitive form , namely as a line integral superposition of directional secondary sources located along the diffracting edge @xcite .",

    "@xcite had appeared already in ref .",
    "@xcite , but the interpretation in terms of secondary edge sources seems to have been first made in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "one appealing feature of the edge source interpretation is that it offers a natural way to write down approximate solutions for finite edges , simply by truncating the domain of integration .",
    "it has also led to edge integral equation formulations of scattering problems , where the integral equation is posed on the union of all the scatterer s edges @xcite . for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions the edge source formulations",

    "some exact solutions are also known .",
    "for example , the case of plane wave incidence on an impedance wedge can be solved using the sommerfeld - malyuzhinets technique , and converted to a series expansion using a watson - type transformation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "but the solution obtained is much more cumbersome than those for the corresponding dirichlet and neumann problems , and the technique requires the solution of a certain non - trivial functional difference equation .",
    "this increased complexity is perhaps to be expected , since the physics of the impedance problem are fundamentally more complicated than those for the dirichlet and neumann problems ; in particular , the wedge faces can under certain conditions support surface waves .",
    "however , for the special ( yet important ) case of a right - angled wedge , the solution takes a particularly simple and explicit form@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , rawlins proves that the solution to the impedance problem for a right - angled wedge ( with possibly different impedances on each face ) can be obtained from that of the corresponding dirichlet problem , generalised to allow complex incident angles , by the application of a certain linear differential operator ( see eqs .  ",
    "below for details ) .",
    "rawlins applies this operator to the classical series and integral representations of the dirichlet solution to obtain relatively simple series and integral representations for the impedance solution .",

    "this appears to be the first edge source representation for diffraction by an impedance wedge .",
    "while the solution obtained is valid only for a right - angled wedge , it should be remarked that this special case is ubiquitous in many acoustical applications ( e.g. , urban acoustics @xcite ) .",

    "then the diffracted field at @xmath1 ( i.e.  the total field minus the geometrical acoustics field ) due to a monopole source at @xmath19 can be written as a line integral @xmath20 over edge positions @xmath4 , where @xmath21 is the wedge index @xcite .",
    "the integral in eq .   can be interpreted as a superposition of secondary edge sources along the edge .",
