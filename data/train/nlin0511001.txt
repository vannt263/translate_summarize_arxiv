    "what happens to a society when a large fraction of people switches from a conformist to a non - conformist attitude ? is the transition smooth or revolutionary ?",
    "these important questions , whose answers can make the difference between two well - known political points of view , is approached using a theoretical model , in the spirit of latan s social impact theory  @xcite .",
    "we assume that one s own inclination towards political choices originates from a mixture of a certain degree of conformism and non - conformism .",
    "conformists tend to agree with the local community majority , that is with the average opinion in a given neighborhood , while non - conformists do the opposite .",
    "however , an overwhelming majority in the neighborhood ( which includes the subject itself ) is always followed .",
    "we shall study here the case of a homogeneous population , i.e.  a homogeneous democratic society .",
    "it may be considered as the annealed version of a real population , which is supposedly composed by a mixture of conformist and non - conformist people who do not change easily their attitude .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce a class of probabilistic cellular automata characterized by the size @xmath0 of the neighborhood , a majority threshold @xmath1 , a coupling constant @xmath2 and an external field @xmath3 .",
    "we are interested in the two extreme cases : people living on a one - dimensional lattice , interacting only with their nearest neighbors ( @xmath4 ) and people interacting with a mean - field opinion .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : r1 ] we present the simplest case where each individual interacts with his two nearest neighbors ( @xmath4 ) , the mean field phase diagram and the one found from numerical experiments . for this simple case",
    ", we find a complex behavior which includes first and second order phase transitions , a chaotic region and the presence of two universality classes  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : meanfield ] we discuss the mean field behavior of the model for arbitrary neighborhoods and majority thresholds when the external field is zero and the coupling constant is negative ( non - conformist society ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the model exhibits a large region of coherent temporal oscillations of the whole populations , either chaotic or regular .",
    "these oscillations are still present in the lattice version with a sufficient large fraction of long - range connections among individuals , due to the small - world effect  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the opinion assumed by individual @xmath6 at time @xmath7 .",
    "we shall limit to two opinions , denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 as usual in spin models .",
    "the system is composed by @xmath10 individuals arranged on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "all operations on spatial indices are assumed to be modulo @xmath10 ( periodic boundary conditions ) . the time is considered discontinuous ( corresponding , for instance , to election events ) .",
    "the state of the whole system at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 ;    the individual opinion is formed according to a local community `` pressure '' and a global influence . in order to avoid a tie , we assume that the local community is formed by @xmath0 individuals , counting on equal ground the opinion of the individual himself at previous time .",
    "the average opinion of the local community around site @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the control parameters are the probabilities @xmath14 of choosing opinion @xmath9 at time @xmath15 if this opinion is shared by @xmath16 people in the local community , i.e.   if the local `` field '' is @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a parameter controlling the influence of the local field in the opinion formation process and @xmath3 be the external social pressure .",
    "the probability @xmath14 are given by @xmath18    one could think to @xmath3 as the television influence , and @xmath2 as educational effects .",
    "@xmath3 pushes towards one opinion or the other , and people educated towards conformism will have @xmath19 , while non - conformists will have @xmath20 . in the statistical mechanics lingo ,",
    "all parameters are rescaled to include the temperature .",
    "the hypothesis of alignment to overwhelming local majority is represented by a parameter @xmath1 , indicating the critical size of local majority . if @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , then @xmath23 , and if @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , then @xmath26 .    in summary ,",
    "the local transition probabilities of the model are @xmath27 where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath30 the model reduces to an ising spin system . for all @xmath31 we have two absorbing homogeneous states , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) corresponding to infinite coupling ( or zero temperature ) in the statistical mechanical sense . with these assumptions",
    ", the model reduces to a one - dimensional , one - component , totalistic cellular automaton with two absorbing states .",
    "the order parameter is the fraction @xmath36 of people sharing opinion @xmath9 .  .",
    "] it is zero or one in the two absorbing states , and assumes other values in the active phase .",
    "the model is symmetric since the two absorbing states have the same importance .",
    "let us study the model for the simplest , nontrivial case : one dimensional lattice , @xmath4 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have a probabilistic cellular automaton with three inputs , and two free control parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while @xmath40 and @xmath41 , according to eq .  .",
    "one can also invert the relation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 : @xmath44 the diagonal @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 and the diagonal @xmath47 to @xmath48 .    at the boundaries of probability intervals , we have four deterministic ( elementary ) cellular automata , that we denote t3 , t23 , t13 and t123 , where the digits indicate the values of @xmath16 for which @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "rule t3 ( t123 ) brings the system into the @xmath33 ( @xmath35 ) absorbing state except for the special case of the initial configuration homogeneously composed by the opposite opinion .",
    "coded as gray levels ranging from white ( @xmath33 ) to black ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the dashed upper - left region denotes the coexistence phase , in which both states @xmath33 and @xmath35 are stable , and the final state depends on the initial density ( first - order transition ) .",
    ", width=226 ]    rule t23 is a strict majority rule , whose evolution starting from a random configuration leads to the formation of frozen patches of zeros and ones in a few time steps .",
    "a small variation of the probabilities induces fluctuations in the position of the patches .",
    "since the patches disappear when the boundaries collide , the system is equivalent to a model of annihilating random walks , which , in one dimensions , evolves towards one of the two absorbing states according to the asymmetries in the probabilities or in the initial configuration .",
    "rule t13 on the other hand is a `` chaotic '' one ,   leading to irregular pattern for almost all initial conditions ( except for the absorbing states ) .",
    "these patterns are microscopically very sensitive to perturbations , but very robust for what concerns global quantities ( magnetization ) .",
    "the role of frustrations ( the difficulty of choosing a stable opinion ) is evidentiated by the following considerations .",
    "rule t23 corresponds to a ferromagnetic ising model at zero temperature , so an individual can simply align with the local majority with no frustrations . on the contrary ,",
    "rule t13 is unable to converge towards an absorbing state ( always present ) , because these states are unstable : a single individual disagreeing with the global opinion triggers a flip in all local community to which he / she belongs to .",
    "it is possible to quantify these concepts by defining stability parameters similar to lyapunov exponents  @xcite .",
    "we start by studying the mean - field approximation for the generic case , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 different from zero or one .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath51 denote the density of opinion @xmath9 at times @xmath7 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "we have @xmath52 this map has three fixed points , the state @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , the state @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and a microscopically disordered state ( @xmath53 ) . the model is obviously symmetric under the changes @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , implying a fundamental equivalence of political opinions in this model .",
    "the stability of fixed points marks the different phases , as shown in fig .  1",
    ".    the stability of the state @xmath35 ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to large social pressure towards opinion  @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath2 determines if a change in social pressure corresponds to a smooth or abrupt transition .",
    "the numerical phase diagram of the model starting from a random initial state with @xmath57 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the scenario is qualitatively the same as predicted by the mean - field analysis .",
    "in the upper - left part of the diagram both states @xmath33 and @xmath35 are stable . in this region",
    "the final fate of the system depends on the initial configuration .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the left panel of fig .",
    "4 we show the profile of the reconstructed potential @xmath58 for some values of @xmath59 around the critical value on the line @xmath60 , over which the model belongs to the dp universality class",
    ". one can observe that the curve becomes broader in the vicinity of the critical point , in correspondence of the divergence of critical fluctuations @xmath61 , @xmath62  @xcite . by repeating the same type of simulations for the kink dynamics ( random initial condition ) ,",
    "we obtain slightly different curves , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "we notice that all curves have roughly the same width .",
    "indeed , the exponent @xmath63 for systems in the pc universality class is believed to be exactly @xmath64  @xcite , as given by the scaling relation @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "clearly , much more information can be obtained from the knowledge of @xmath66 , either by direct numerical simulations or dynamical mean field trough finite scale analysis , as shown for instance in ref .",
    "in order to study the effects of a larger neighborhood and different threshold values @xmath1 , let us start with the well known two - dimensional `` vote '' model .",
    "it is defined on a square lattice , with a moore neighborhood composed by 9 neighbors , synthetically denoted m in the following  @xcite . if a strict majority rule @xmath67 is applied ( rule m56789 , same convention as in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) to a random initial configuration , one observes the rapid quenching of small clusters of ones and zero , similar to what happens with rule t23 in the one - dimensional case .",
    "a small noise quickly leads the system to an absorbing state . on the other hand , a small frustration @xmath68 ( rule m46789 ) for an initial density",
    "@xmath57 leads to a metastable point formed by patches that evolve very slowly towards one of the two absorbing states .",
    "however , this metastable state is given by the perfect balance among the absorbing states .",
    "if one starts with a different initial `` magnetization '' , one of the two absorbing phases quickly dominates , except for small imperfections that disappear when a small noise is added .    in the general case ,",
    "the mean - field equation is @xmath69 sketched in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fasecm ] .",
    "we studied the asymptotic behavior of this map for different values of @xmath70 and @xmath1 . for a given @xmath70",
    "there is always a critical @xmath71 value of @xmath1 for which the active phase disappears , with an approximate correspondence @xmath72 .",
    "the active phase is favored by the presence of frustrations and the absence of the external pressure , i.e.  for @xmath20 and @xmath48 .",
    "we performed extensive computations for the extreme case @xmath73 , @xmath48 corresponding to a society of non - conformists without television .",
    "as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fasecm ] , by increasing the neighborhood size @xmath70 , one starts observing oscillations in the equilibrium process .",
    "this is evident in the limit of infinite neighborhood : the parallel dynamics induced by elections ( in our model ) makes individual tend to disalign from the marginal majority , originating temporal oscillations that can have a chaotic character .",
    "since the absorbing states are present , and they are stable for @xmath31 , the coherent oscillations of the population can bring the system into one absorbing state .",
    "this is reflected by the `` hole '' in the active phase in the mean field phase diagram .",
    "preliminary lattice simulations ( not shown ) reveal that this behavior is still present if there is a sufficiently large fraction of long - range connections due to the small - world effect  @xcite , while the active phase is compact in the short - range case .",
    "although this model is quite rough , there are aspects that present some analogies with the behavior of a real society",
    ". in particular , the role of education , represented by the @xmath2 parameter . in a society dominated by conformists , the transitions are difficult and catastrophic , while in the opposite case of non - conformist people the transitions are smooth . however , in the latter case a great social pressure is needed to gain the majority .    on the other hand , if the neighborhood is large and non - conformism is present , one can observe the phenomenon of political instabilities given by temporal oscillations of population opinion , which could be interpreted as a symptom of healthy democracy .",
