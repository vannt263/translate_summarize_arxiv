    "considered here is the construction and study of fixed point algorithms for the numerical resolution of nonlinear systems of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a nonsingular @xmath2 real matrix and @xmath3 is an homogeneous function of the components of @xmath4 with degree @xmath5 .",
    "these systems are typical in many applications , including the approximation to equilibria in mechanical systems and the numerical generation of traveling waves and ground states in nonlinear dispersive systems for water waves and nonlinear optics .",
    "( in this last context , @xmath6 would represent the number of discretization points . ) more generally , ( [ m1 ] ) may appear when generating relative equilibria or coherent structures , @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 a solution of ( [ m1 ] ) , that is @xmath8 the classical fixed point algorithm for ( [ m1 ] ) has the following formulation . if @xmath9 , the approximation to @xmath10 in ( [ m1a ] ) at the @xmath11-th iteration is given by the recurrence @xmath12     the method ( [ m1b ] ) is not usually convergent for this kind of problems . note that if @xmath13 stands for the iteration matrix at @xmath7 ( and where @xmath14 denotes the jacobian of @xmath15 at @xmath4 ) , then the homogeneous character of @xmath15 implies that @xmath16 therefore , using ( [ m1a ] ) , @xmath17 thus , @xmath7 is an eigenvector of @xmath18 associated to an eigenvalue @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the methods presented here generalize the so - called petviashvili method . from a starting iteration @xmath9 ,",
    "the petviashvili method generates the recurrence @xmath21 where here and in the rest of the paper @xmath22 stands for the euclidean inner product and @xmath23 is a free real parameter .",
    "the term ( [ m2 ] ) is called stabilizing factor and , in the case of convergence , must tend to one .",
    "the origin of the method is in @xcite , focused on the search for lump solitary waves of the kadomtsev - petviashvili i ( kpi ) equation @xmath24 of the form @xmath25",
    ". the profile @xmath26 must satisfy @xmath27 which , in terms of the @xmath28-d fourier transform , @xmath29 is converted into an algebraic system @xmath30 the divergence of the classical fixed point algorithm , applied to ( [ crete3 ] ) forces to consider a new iteration system , of the form @xmath31 where the stabilizing factor @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 ( @xmath34 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath35 ) where @xmath23 is a free real parameter . in the case of ( [ crete1 ] ) , @xmath23 is taken approximately @xmath28 , @xcite . on the other hand , for the exact profile @xmath26 , @xmath36 .    the petviashvili method has become popular as a technique to generate special solutions in partial differential equations of interest in water waves and nonlinear optics .",
    "it takes part of a large family of methods designed to this goal , which includes variants of the newton s method , @xcite , modified conjugate gradient methods applied to nonlinear problems , @xcite , squared operator methods , @xcite , imaginary - time evolution methods , @xcite or different variational procedures , @xcite . some literature about ( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ m3 ] ) , from the original paper , @xcite , is now briefly reviewed .",
    "pelinovsky and stepanyants , @xcite , analyze the continuous version of the method to approximate solitary wave profiles of the nonlinear dispersive models @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a pseudodifferential operator with positive fourier symbol . on the other hand , lakoba and yang , @xcite ,",
    "introduce a generalized version of the procedure , for more general systems of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is positive definite , self - adjoint operator and @xmath41 is nonlinear ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , ablowitz and musslimani , @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) propose an alternative of the algorithm , the spectral renormalization method , with application to generate numerically ground state profiles for systems of nls type @xmath42    some new results contained in this paper are described below .    * based on the philosophy the petviashvili method was devised with , new fixed point methods are derived .",
    "they can be considered as a petviashvili type family of methods .",
    "* from the view point of the classical algorithm , the corresponding iteration functions are designed to filter the harmful directions of the errors leading to divergence , in such a way that convergence results are obtained under the same hypotheses as those of the petviashvili method .",
    "here it is worth mentioning two types of convergence .",
    "the first one has the classical sense , with the requirement ( among others ) of isolated fixed points .",
    "however , in traveling wave generation , it is very typical that the system of equations admits a symmetry group ( usually related to translational or rotational invariance of the system ) . in this case",
    ", fixed points can not be isolated and the convergence must be understood in the orbital sense , that is , for the orbits of fixed points .",
    "convergence results for both cases will be given .",
    "this study complements some previous results of convergence presented in the literature for the petviashvili method , @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] and starting from the petviashvili method ( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ m3 ] ) , the new family of fixed point algorithms are constructed and analyzed .",
    "a comparison of efficiency of some of them is also carried out .",
    "section [ sec3 ] will treat the derivation of general conditions for the local convergence of the methods .",
    "the first part of the study assumes the existence of a neighborhood where the fixed point @xmath10 is unique .",
    "the spectral analysis of the iteration matrix ( [ m2b ] ) of the classical fixed point algorithm ( or , equivalently , the pencil @xmath43 ) is used .",
    "the local convergence of the methods can be achieved even when ( [ m2b ] ) admits eigenvalues with modulus greater than or equals one .",
    "the results are illustrated with several numerical examples , concerning the generation of localized ground state solutions of nonlinear schrdinger type equations with potentials .",
    "on the other hand , some other applications of the methods suggest to analyze a case where the hypothesis of local uniqueness of the fixed point does not hold , in the sense that the system ( [ m1 ] ) admits a group of symmetries , generating orbits of solutions . from the point of view of the analysis , the existence of a symmetry group in ( [ m1 ] ) is associated to the formation of the eigenvalue one in the pencil , @xcite , and leads , in a natural way , to the concept of orbital convergence .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is finished off with the corresponding results of convergence for this case and they will be illustrated by the generation of soliton solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the present paper is a first part of a study of the methods carried out by the same authors .",
    "it will be followed by a second part , in which some particular , relevant cases of systems ( [ m1 ] ) are emphasized and where the effect of the introduction of acceleration techniques is studied .",
    "the following fixed point methods for the iterative resolution of ( [ m1 ] ) are introduced .",
    "if @xmath44 , the iterations @xmath45 are generated by a formula of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a @xmath48 function satisfying the following properties :    * a set of fixed points of the iteration operator @xmath49 coincides with a set of fixed points of ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "this means that : ( a ) if @xmath10 is a solution of ( [ m1 ] ) then @xmath50 ; ( b ) inversely , if the sequence @xmath51 , generated by ( [ m4 ] ) , converges to some @xmath52 , then @xmath53 ( and , consequently , @xmath52 is a solution of ( [ m1 ] ) ) .",
    "* @xmath54 is homogeneous with degree @xmath55 such that @xmath56 .",
    "note that , in particular , the choice @xmath57 leads to the petviashvili method ( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ m3 ] ) .",
    "then , ( [ m4 ] ) can be considered as a generalization and justifies that @xmath54 will be also called a stabilizing factor .",
    "several examples are the following :    * the term ( [ m5 ] ) can be generalized by considering any @xmath48 homogeneous function @xmath58 with degree greater than or equals one and taking @xmath59 * another alternative is the use of norms , with @xmath60 where if @xmath61 then @xmath62 , with @xmath63 standing for the usual maximum norm .",
    "the case @xmath64 was considered in @xcite .      displayed here",
    "are some numerical experiments concerning the performance of the methods , according to the choice of the stabilizing factor . as an example we consider the problem of generating lump solitary waves in the 2d benjamin equation @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 stands for the hilbert transform with respect to @xmath68 : @xmath69 equation ( [ ben2da ] ) is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "it appears as an extension of the one - dimensional equation derived by benjamin , @xcite , and modeling the propagation of waves at the interface of two ideal fluids , with a bounded upper layer and the heavier one with infinite depth , and under the presence of interfacial tension .",
    "the two - dimensional version incorporates weak transverse variations .",
    "the form ( [ ben2da ] ) contains particular cases , such as the kamdotsev - petviashvili ( kp - i ) equation , @xcite ( @xmath70 ) and the two - dimensional benjamin - davis - ono ( bdo ) equation , corresponding to @xmath71 , @xcite . a normalized form of ( [ ben2da ] ) @xmath72 is derived in @xcite and will be adopted here .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 is related to the interfacial tension and the densities of the fluids .",
    "finally , for localized solutions , the constraint @xmath74 ( zero total mass condition ) is assumed , as in the kp and bdo equations @xcite .",
    "the search for lump solitary wave solutions of ( [ ben2db ] ) @xmath75 leads to the equation @xmath76 for the profile @xmath77 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that ( [ lumpsw ] ) admits lumps of wavepacket type , as well as lumps of kp - i type ( see figures [ fexample41](d ) and [ fexample41](a ) respectively ) .",
    "the bifurcation point corresponds to @xmath78 . as an alternative to the numerical procedure performed in that paper ,",
    "some lumps will be here generated numerically , by using numerical continuation in @xmath79 from the known lump solitary wave solution of the kp - i equation ( corresponding to @xmath80 ) , @xcite .",
    "taking two - dimensional fourier transform in ( [ lumpsw ] ) we have @xmath81 the continuation algorithm until the computation of the profile at certain value @xmath82 consists of defining an homotopic path @xmath83 and solving numerically ( [ lumpsw2 ] ) with the method ( [ m4 ] ) at each @xmath84 and initial iteration given by the last computed iterate at the previous stage @xmath85 .",
    "the procedure starts with the exact kp - i lump at @xmath86 .",
    "the numerical resolution of ( [ lumpsw2 ] ) with ( [ m4 ] ) is now described .",
    "note that ( [ lumpsw2 ] ) for @xmath87 leaves the @xmath88-fourier component free and the value @xmath89 is set by the zero total mass condition ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "system ( [ lumpsw2 ] ) is discretized by using a fourier collocation scheme and , with the notation of ( [ m1 ] ) , the corresponding discrete system leads to a singular matrix @xmath1 . in order to solve this ,",
    "the @xmath88-fourier component of the approximation is set to zero , then the resulting system for the rest of the fourier components is not singular and is therefore iteratively solved with ( [ m4 ] ) , @xcite . the numerical results are shown in figure [ fexample41 ] .",
    "( they correspond to @xmath90 . ) on the left , different lump profiles , associated to several values of @xmath79 are displayed . on the right ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath91 and @xmath92 cross sections are represented .",
    "the convergence of the procedure is illustrated by figure [ fexample42 ] .",
    "for the case @xmath93 , it shows the limiting behaviour of the stabilizing factor ( left ) and the residual errors ( right ) @xmath94 ( where here and in the rest of the paper @xmath95 stands for the euclidean norm ) both as functions of the number of iterations as for several choices of the stabilizing factor , from the two families ( [ m6a ] ) , ( [ m6b ] ) .    as a representative of ( [ m6a ] ) ,",
    "the original petviashvili method ( @xmath96 ) has been compared with two methods with stabilizing factors of the form ( [ m6b ] ) , corresponding to @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ fexample42](a ) shows that the convergence of the stabilizing factor to one is more efficient with the petviashvili method : it provides an error with less iterations and , for a fixed number of iterations , it gives a smaller discrepancy .",
    "this is also the conclusion when analyzing figure [ fexample42](b ) , concerning the behaviour of the residual error with the number of iterations .",
    "however , this better performance of the petviashvili method in this example is not big enough to be conclusive and to rule the rest of the methods out in a general situation .",
    "we have the impression that in terms of the computational effort , the methods are more or less equivalent , with a slight superiority of ( [ m2 ] ) , ( [ m3 ] ) .",
    "for that reason , this will be considered as a representative of ( [ m4 ] ) for the rest of the experiments in this paper ( see section [ sec3 ] ) .    finally ,",
    "although the main goal of the example is illustrating a comparison between some methods of the family ( [ m4 ] ) , it is worth mentioning that ( [ ben2db ] ) is translationally invariant .",
    "thus , the convergence must be understood in the sense analyzed in section [ sec33 ] ( orbital convergence ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the convergence of the methods ( [ m4 ] ) can be divided in two cases , depending on the character of @xmath10 as fixed point of ( [ m1 ] ) . in what follows , the jacobian of the iteration operator ( [ iterop ] ) at a fixed point @xmath10 satisfying ( [ m1a ] ) , @xmath98 will be used .",
    "( in ( [ m6c ] ) , the gradient @xmath99 is taken as a row vector . )",
    "we first define the pencil @xmath43 , where @xmath10 satisfies ( [ m1a ] ) .",
    "note that , since @xmath1 is nonsingular , the zeros of @xmath100 coincide with the spectrum of the iteration matrix ( [ m2b ] ) , see @xcite , section 4.5 and @xcite , section 7.7 .",
    "( in particular , @xmath19 is a zero of @xmath100 with @xmath101 . )",
    "we also remind that an eigenvalue @xmath102 of a matrix is semisimple if the corresponding geometric and algebraic multiplicities are the same ; that is , if the dimension of the associated eigenspace coincides with the order of @xmath102 as zero of the characteristic polynomial .    [ theorem1 ]",
    "assume that    * there exists @xmath103 such that @xmath10 in ( [ m1a ] ) is the unique fixed point of ( [ m1 ] ) in @xmath104 .",
    "take @xmath9 and assume the following hypotheses on the zeros of @xmath100 :    * @xmath19 is simple .",
    "* the rest of @xmath102 satisfies @xmath105 . *",
    "if @xmath106    then the method ( [ m4 ] ) , with @xmath54 satisfying ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) , is locally convergent , that is , there is a neighborhood @xmath107 of @xmath10 such that if @xmath108 , the sequence @xmath51 generated by ( [ m4 ] ) , converges to @xmath10 .",
    "the optimal rate of convergence is obtained with @xmath109 .",
    "_ proof_. the errors @xmath110 satisfy @xmath111 where @xmath112 is given by ( [ m6c ] ) .",
    "according to the hypotheses ( i)-(iii ) , @xmath113 can be decomposed @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a @xmath18 invariant supplementary subspace of @xmath116 .",
    "( @xmath115 is the sum of the @xmath18-invariant subspaces associated to the eigenvalues of @xmath18 different from @xmath19 . ) substituting ( [ m8 ] ) into ( [ m7 ] ) and neglecting second order terms the system @xmath117 is obtained .",
    "( last equality in ( [ m9 ] ) comes from ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) , which imply that @xmath118 . )",
    "due to hypotheses ( ii ) and ( iii ) , the sequence @xmath119 in ( [ m10 ] ) converges to zero .",
    "this and property ( p2 ) imply then that @xmath120 in ( [ m9 ] ) , leading to local convergence .",
    "finally , the fastest rate of convergence occurs when the factor @xmath121 in ( [ m9 ] ) is zero.@xmath122    in summary , under the hypotheses of theorem [ theorem1 ] , the iteration map ( [ iterop ] ) is contractive in a neighborhood of the fixed point , with the fastest rate of convergence when @xmath109 .",
    "condition ( iii ) was already obtained in @xcite , for the equations treated there and the continuous version of the petviashvili method . in this sense ,",
    "theorem [ theorem1 ] establishes the fact that ( iii ) is one of the sufficient conditions for the local convergence for more general methods and in more general systems .",
    "assumption ( iii ) also suggests a dependence of the convergence on the choice of the initial iterate , not only in the sense required by the local convergence , but also because @xmath123 must contain the correct directions . the contribution to the iteration error of the components of @xmath123 in these harmful  eigendirections that ( iii ) is concerned with , can be sketched as follows .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath18 contains one semisimple eigenvalue @xmath124 with @xmath125 and the rest of the spectrum ( except @xmath19 ) is below one in modulus . in ( [ m8 ] ) , we can decompose the term @xmath126 in the form @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "( thus , @xmath129 can be written as a linear combination of a basis of @xmath130 , with the coordinates depending on @xmath131 . ) now , ( [ m9 ] ) and ( [ m10 ] ) can be written as @xmath132 therefore , due to ( [ m101 ] ) and the previous assumptions on the spectrum of @xmath18 , @xmath133 goes to zero , while ( [ m92 ] ) implies @xmath134 being @xmath135 the component of @xmath136 in @xmath137 ( which is to say the component of @xmath123 in @xmath137 ) .",
    "then ( [ m91 ] ) becomes @xmath138 thus , in general , @xmath139 would be @xmath140 as @xmath141 . as proved by theorem [ theorem1 ] , if @xmath142 ( condition ( iii ) ) and using ( p2 ) , then @xmath139 tends to zero as @xmath141 .",
    "the previous arguments also say that the errors would behave as the size of the component @xmath135 .",
    "the comparison between the matrices @xmath18 and @xmath112 reveals that the stabilizing factor acts like a filter for the harmful direction of the error that leads to the nonconvergence of the classical fixed - point algorithm in this case .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath143 differs from that of @xmath18 in the dominant eigenvalue @xmath144 , which is transformed to some less than one ( or , eventually , to zero eigenvalue if the optimal case is taken ) , leading to convergence if the rest of the spectrum of @xmath18 , with probably the help of the initial iteration , behaves in the way described in theorem [ theorem1 ] see the numerical experiments in sections [ sec32 ] and [ sec34 ] ) .",
    "as a first example , the application of the petviashvili method to generate localized ground state solutions of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model @xmath145 with a potential @xmath146 is considered .",
    "a ground state solution has the form @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and the profile @xmath149 is assumed to be real and localized ( @xmath150 ) and then must satisfy @xmath151 the petviashvili method ( as a representative of the family ( [ m4 ] ) , see section [ sec22 ] ) can be applied to a discretization of ( [ doub_well12 ] ) .",
    "one way to treat numerically the problem is approximating ( [ doub_well12 ] ) on a sufficiently long interval @xmath152 and then discretizing the corresponding system for the profile .",
    "as an illustration , the discretization based on a fourier collocation method for the periodic problem is taken , in such a way that the corresponding discrete equations have the form ( [ m1 ] ) with @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the pseudospectral differentiation matrix , ( see @xcite , chapter 6 and @xcite , chapter 2 ) , @xmath155 is the diagonal matrix with elements @xmath156 , @xmath157 is the @xmath2 identity matrix and the dot in the nonlinearity @xmath15 stands for the hadamard product from the approximation @xmath158 to the exact values of the profile at the grid points @xmath159 .    .ground state generation for ( [ doub_well11 ] ) with @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "six largest magnitude eigenvalues of the approximate iteration matrix ( [ m2b ] ) and of the jacobian ( [ m6c ] ) .",
    "both are evaluated at the last computed iterate @xmath162 of the petviashvili method for ( [ doub_well12 ] ) and aitem for ( [ doub_well12 ] ) , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     local convergence of the petviashvili method is first checked by table [ tav2 ] .",
    "this shows , for @xmath163 , the first largest magnitude eigenvalues of the iteration matrix @xmath18 at the exact profile ( [ nlse4])-([nlse4c ] ) with parameters @xmath164 , ( where @xmath165 ) . the results guarantee the satisfaction of the conditions for local convergence .",
