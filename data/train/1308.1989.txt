    "additional information can be obtained from the wavelength - dispersed fluorescence . in gerneral",

    "high spatial resolution is usually achieved by right - angle collection of the fluorescent light with a large - aperture lens .",
    "an absolute measurement of absorbance requires detailed knowledge of the fluorescence process and careful calibration of the detection system ( fluorescence quantum yield , geometrical setup , spectral response of the detector , _ etc .",
    "using amplified photodetectors , laser - induced fluorescence can be measured linearly over a large dynamic range from single - photon counting to saturation of the photodetector .",
    "the measurement is virtually background free if stray light from the incident laser is suppressed effectively , _",
    "e.g. _  with an optical filter .",
    "if the fluoresecence lifetime is long compared to the laser pulse length , stray light can also be discriminated against by time gating of the signal .",
    "if the fluorescence lifetime exceeds the time between collisions , quenching of the fluorescence can occur , reducing the signal potentially to a level which makes a measurement impossible .",
    "in addition , quenching , predissociation and other non - radiative processes complicate a straightforward relationship between signal and concentration , due to possible dependences of these processes on the excited state .",

    "the inverse of the decay rate of the signal is referred to as ring - down time , which for an empty cavity is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the distance between the mirrors of reflectivity @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the speed of light .",
    "depending on the reflectivity of the mirrors , several thousand round trips can be achieved . with cavity lengths of the order of 1",
    "m the effective pathlengths are of the order of many kilometers .",
    "the absorption of light by a sample inside the cavity causes an additional loss and consequently a shorter ring - down time .",
    "the reduced ring - down time , @xmath5 , is directly linked to the absorption coefficient @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the absorption cross section and @xmath8 is the number density of the sample , leading to a photon loss per pass of @xmath9 .",

    "the fluorescence signal , cavity ring - down intensity and cavity ring - down time are cross - correlated in a way that significantly enhances both techniques .",
    "the crd measurement provides the absolute calibration of the lif signal .",
    "the combined techniques lower the detection limit of the crd measurement by several orders of magnitude .",

    "it is a straightforward combination of a classical lif and pulsed crds setup : the sample is intersected by the laser beam that is confined in the cavity and the laser - induced fluorescence is collected at right angles . in our setup the wavelength - integrated fluorescence is recorded . without loss of generality , the technique can be used in a setup where the dispersed fluorescence spectrum is measured . in principle , the technique should be widely applicable to any gas - phase , liquid and even solid samples which have been used in previous crds studies as long as the fluorescence light can be extracted from the sample volume .    in the following subsection",
    "we derive how in our combined crd / lif setup the cavity ring - down signal is used to normalize and absolutely calibrate the lif signal .      in a general lif measurement ,",
    "the time - integrated lif signal , @xmath11 , is proportional to the light intensity , @xmath12 , that has interacted with the sample within the lif probe volume : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the excitation wavelength , @xmath15 is the fluorescence quantum yield and @xmath16 is a geometry dependent factor of the detection system . in principle , @xmath16 is also a function of @xmath14 as the fluorescence spectrum may depend on the excited state . however , this dependence can only be considered if the dispersed fluorescence spectrum is recorded as a function of excitation wavelength . in order to obtain the absorption coefficient , @xmath17 , from a fluorescence excitation measurement , @xmath11 and @xmath12",

    "the factor @xmath16 is an instrument function that is not readily available but can be determined via a meticulous external calibration .",
    "the fluorescence quantum yield , @xmath15 , is generally unknown and needs to be measured or predicted from theory in a separate study .    fundamentally , celif is a lif measurement where the simultaneous crd measurement is used for the normalization and the calibration of the lif signal . in the following ,",
    "we derive how the time - integrated crd signal is correlated to @xmath12 and how it is subsequently used to provide the normalization of @xmath11 to eliminate shot - to - shot fluctuations in the laser intensity from eq .",
    "[ eq : slif ] .",
    "we then describe how the absolute absorption coefficient determined via the ring - down time measurement ( eq .  [ eq : alpha_crd ] ) is used for the absolute calibration of the normalized lif signal such that in a celif measurment prior knowledge of @xmath16 and @xmath15 is not required .    however , there are differences in the measurement of the fluorescence signal between a celif and a typical lif experiment .",
    "only a fraction of the laser light is transmitted through the cavity entrance mirror and is subsequently interacting with the sample . as a consequence ,",
    "the initial fluorescence is very small in comparison to single - pass lif .",
    "the light confined in the cavity undergoes up to several thousand round trips , interacting with the sample twice on each of them .",
    "each of these interactions induces further fluorescence so that the integrated fluorescence leads to an appreciable lif signal .",
    "effectively , the cavity stretches the short laser pulse into the exponential decay characteristic for the cavity .    without loss of generality , we base the following derivation on a fixed excitation wavelength and on a sample distribution that is symmetric with respect to a lif probe volume that is placed at the center of the cavity .",

    "we will discuss the value of @xmath25 for our setup in section  [ sec : celif_characteristics ] .",
    "similarly , we can derive the integrated crd intensity , @xmath35 , at the exit mirror taking into account that , following the initial single pass , light is only collected after every round trip : @xmath36^{2j } \\nonumber \\\\      & = i_0{^\\text{crd}}\\frac{{1 - \\left[(1 -{\\mathcal{l}})^2 r^2\\right]^{n+1}}}{1 - ( 1 -{\\mathcal{l}})^2 r^2}\\\\ i{^\\text{crd}}&= \\lim_{n\\to\\infty } i_n{^\\text{crd}}= \\frac{i_0{^\\text{crd}}}{1 - ( 1 -{\\mathcal{l}})^2 r^2}\\label{eq : icrd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit of an empty cavity ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 , the measured , time - integrated light intensity imparting on the detector is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the cavity transmission function .",

    "this error is dominated by the mirror reflectivity and reduces to @xmath47 for @xmath48 .    therefore , we define the normalized celif signal as @xmath49 note that @xmath50 is a relative quantity ( unitless in our case ) that can be calibrated to equal the absolute absorption coefficient , @xmath17 , derived from the measurement of ring - down times .",

    "therefore the limited dynamic range of the crd method can be extended towards the generally lower detection limit of the lif method .",
    "the combination of lif and crds into celif enables the measurement of an absolute absorption coefficient over the combined dynamic range .",
    "equations [ eq : alpha_lif ] and [ eq : cal_lif ] hold true for an absorption measurement at a fixed wavelength .",
    "generally , @xmath52 is a function of the excitation wavelength ( fluorescence quantum yield , mirror transmission ) and the fluorescence spectrum ( spectral response of the detection system ) . a single - pass lif measurement needs to account for the wavelength dependencies of the quantum yield and the detection system .",
    "in addition , a calibrated celif spectrum requires knowledge of the wavelength - dependent exit mirror transmission . in section [ sec : yield ] we describe a procedure that uses the simultaneously measured ring - down times and rayleigh scattering collected with the lif detection setup to determine the wavelength dependence of @xmath24 based on our unchanged setup . with two sets of uv and visible mirrors we found the transmission to vary by less than 5% over a wavelength range of 1  nm which will allow to approximate the transmission as constant in many applications .",
    "we note , however , that the common approximation @xmath54 , with @xmath55 derived from an empty - cavity ring - down scan , could not be generally applied over the usable wavelength range of each set of mirrors .",

    "in contrast , mode fluctuations or poor mirror alignment do not affect the celif measurement as only the integrated lif and crd signals , @xmath11 and @xmath35 respectively , are analyzed and not the shape of their transients .",
    "thus , the noise / error in the integrals is only due to the noise of the detectors and the digitization errors .",
    "saturation of the photodetectors needs to be avoided as described above .",
    "the strength of the celif technique is the precise determination of the laser intensity in the cavity , @xmath12 , via the integrated ring - down intensity , @xmath35 .",
    "the subsequent normalization , @xmath79 , minimizes the effect of laser shot - to - shot fluctuations on @xmath50 .",
    "overall , the noise in @xmath11 and @xmath35 is much lower than the noise / error in the determination of the ring - down time leading to the observed , low baseline noise in the celif spectra .",
    "the cavity invokes stringent conditions on the shape and spectral composition of the beam interacting with the sample .",
    "well designed and aligned cavity setups can be excited in a single transversal mode , tem@xmath80 , leading to a well defined gaussian beam waist at the center .",
    "this confinement effectively eliminates any stray light from an empty cavity , greatly reducing the background signal of the celif measurement .",
    "in contrast to a single - pass lif setup , baffles and optical filters to suppress stray light are not necessary . this allows the detection of the whole fluorescence spectrum , including fluorescence on the excitation wavelength . as we have demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerdep ] , very clean measurements of rayleigh scattering are possible .",
    "the mirror reflectivity and cavity length define the longitudinal mode structure supported by the cavity .",
    "the effect of the mode structure on a crd measurement has been discussed in detail by zalicki and zare@xcite and needs to be taken into account similarly for celif .",
    "if we briefly consider a mode - matched cw cavity setup , the laser intensity inside the cavity will build up until the equilibrium is reached .",
    "this intensity ( resonant with a cavity mode ) is by a factor of the finesse higher than the incident laser intensity .",
    "however , in our setups we use non - fourier - limited laser pulses , the spectral bandwidths of which span in the order of ten cavity modes . as",
    "the laser pulse length is comparable to the round - trip time , the cavity mode structure is not fully formed .",

    "therefore , the total light intensity in both techniques differs only by the factor @xmath83 , _ cf . _",

    "interacting with the sample , celif and single - pass , pulsed lif are comparable .",
    "however , the photon flux per sample pass is several orders of magnitude lower for celif resulting in much reduced power broadening of spectral lines .",
    "the amount of molecules that is excited in any given time interval is proportional to the number of laser photons present in the cavity .",
    "consequently , the time evolution of the lif signal is the temporal convolution of the ring - down and fluorescence decays .",
    "the presence of the cavity effectively stretches the initial laser pulse in time , as characterized by the ring - down decay .",

    "the dynamic range of absorbance measurements is at one end determined by the limit of detection ( lod ) defined by the noise level and at the other end by saturation .",

    "the celif signal increases linearly with sample concentration . due to the large rayleigh scattering cross section of bpeb , in these measurements",

    "the accessible range of sample concentrations is limited by the vapor pressure and the temperature control of the sample oven ( low concentrations ) and the finite sample volume and the thermal stability of the molecule ( high concentrations ) .",

    "even if the crd decay is too short to be measured , the fluorescence can be linearly recorded until saturation caused by optical and sample density sets in .",
    "this implies that very strong and weak transitions can be measured in the same scan where the calibration is maintained across the recorded spectrum .",
    "our lowest celif signal - to - noise value of 17 indicates that considerably lower concentrations are accessible .",
    "based on the fluctuations of the signal blank , that is dominated by bpeb rayleigh scattering , we estimate the celif lod as 0.1 ppm or @xmath92 @xmath60 , which constitutes at least a factor of 400 improvement . for our systems ,",
    "signal levels were sufficient to analyze integrated lif traces .",
    "however , for samples with lower absorbances or fluorescence quantum yields , photon counting can be used to further lower the detection limit ( see the following subsection ) .",
    "we examined the noise in the crd and celif signals using the n@xmath62 rayleigh scattering as a function of n@xmath62 pressure in a filled cavity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerdep]b . for the crd measurement",
    "the noise is independent of the n@xmath62 pressure as expected.@xcite both the noise of the integrated signals on the lif , @xmath93 , and the crd detector , @xmath94 , contribute to the noise of the celif measurement , @xmath95 , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : celif_norm ] .",
    "we found that @xmath93 increases with signal , according to a typical pmt response , while @xmath94 is almost constant , leading overall to the observed increase of @xmath95 with pressure , _ i.e. _  signal .    in a filled cavity at high pressure , the signal - to - noise ratios of the celif and crd measurements are comparable whereas at low pressures the celif ratio is two times larger .",
    "compared to this , in the bpeb molecular beam measurements the signal - to - noise ratio and limit of detection are three orders of magnitude better for celif .",
    "crd measures the integrated - column density along the cavity axis whereas celif , like lif , images the density in a localised probe volume . in the n@xmath62 rayleigh scattering experiment , the crd sample length is about 200 times longer than the length of the lif probe volume . for the crd measurement ,",
    "this considerable increase in sample length almost compensates for the higher sensitivity of the celif measurement .    in light of this , celif is  like lif  best applied to localized samples , _",
    "e.g. _  found in molecular beams , in flames or at interfaces .",
    "the strength of crd lies in the long effective path length , _",
    "e.g. _  of a filled cavity . in case of a localized sample volume",
    "the effective path length through the sample can be reduced by orders of magnitude such that this crucial advantage of crd is lost , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : det - limit ] . even for a filled cavity measurement",
    ", celif improves the signal - to - noise ratio in comparison with crd , particularly at low sample concentrations , as seen in fig .",

    "so far , we have discussed how , from the crd measurement , we can directly extract the absorption coefficient , @xmath17 , which in turn can be used to provide an absolute calibration for the celif measurement .",
    "this requires a measurement range in which both crd and celif measurements provide a non - zero @xmath17 , _ cf .",
    "_  eqs  [ eq : alpha_crd ] and [ eq : cal_lif ] . as in conventional crd measurements , for a known sample length the knowledge of either the sample density or the absorption cross section will allow the absolute measurement of the other .",
    "however , in these bpeb measurements using a molecular beam , the sample density can not easily be determined .",
    "we have since measured absolute sample densities of the deuterated mercapto radical ( sd ) in a dilute molecular beam where the absorption cross section is known.@xcite employing photon counting , the lowest detected sample density was @xmath96  @xmath97 corresponding to an @xmath98  @xmath60 .",
    "the sd and bpeb measurements used a similar celif setup and detection wavelength .",
    "this further improved celif lod is by a factor of 7500 superior to the crd measurements presented here .",
    "we can therefore conclude that celif extends the dynamic range of absorbance measurements compared to a sole crd measurement by at least three orders of magnitude .",
    "lif is a popular technique for quantitative measurements of species in flames due to its high sensitivity , spatial resolution and non - invasive nature .",
    "however , for absolute calibration , separate measurements like rayleigh scattering and , more recently , crd spectroscopy@xcite were used .",
    "variations in optical setup and sample composition between the sequential lif and crd measurement may affect the calibration .",
    "in contrast , our single - beam celif method uses the simultaneous and correlated lif and crd measurements of the same sample with the same laser pulse to give a robust and consistent calibration .",
    "the celif method is equally applicable to short and long fluorescence lifetimes compared to the laser pulse length .",
    "short fluorescence lifetimes impose challenges on single - pass , pulsed lif .",
    "the fluorescence signal is obscured by the stray light of the excitation pulse and the rayleigh scattered light from the sample and can not easily be discriminated against by gated detection .",
    "stray - light - free signal may only be sampled over a limited temporal range leading to a large noise on the digitized signal .",
    "the comparison of fluorescence excitation spectra of bpeb with a fluorescence lifetime of @xmath99  ps@xcite obtained with celif and single - pass lif under similar conditions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : celifvlif ] . for the single - pass lif measurement , the laser beam",
    "was expanded such that the probe volume was approximately 30 times larger than for celif in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and to limit saturation .",
    "the lif signal was normalized on a shot - to - shot basis against the laser intensity recorded on a pyro detector at the exit window .",
    "stray light was suppressed using a long - pass filter ( semrock , 341 nm blocking edge brightline ) in front of the lif photomultiplier .",
    "the observed noise on the lif baseline is @xmath10025 times larger than in the celif spectrum .",
    "this demonstrates the difficulty measuring the 500  ps fluorescence free from stray light using a 5  ns laser pulse . as discussed earlier , in celif measurements",
    "stray light is not supported by the cavity .",
    "although we occasionally observe a small initial peak due to stray light at the very start of the crd and lif transients , both these peaks can be completely removed by appropriate gating of the signal .",
    "furthermore , the remaining long lif signal can be digitized with hundreds of sample points reducing the digitization noise significantly . in order to separate the stray light from fast fluorescence signal ,",
    "ps lasers and fast signal digitization need to be employed as demonstrated by the fluorescence lifetime measurements of bpeb by fujiwara _ _ et al.__@xcite    for short fluorescence lifetimes , the lif transient will follow the crd transient . in this case , only a part of the transients needs to be integrated , _",
    "e.g. _  using the same limits for both the crd and lif signals , to ensure the correct celif normalization , see fig .",
    "[ fig : transients ] . for long fluorescence lifetimes , the only necessary change to gain",
    "valid celif spectra is the full integration of both transients . in principle , by deconvoluting the lif transient by the crd transient fluorescence lifetimes can be extracted .",
    "long ring - down times reduce the number of photons per unit time in the cavity and , if combined with long fluorescence lifetimes , can lead to signal levels that require photon counting .",
    "several groups have used combinations of crds with lif in order to measure quantum yields or quenching rates .",
    "et al . _",
    "combined a crd measurement with lif in a single setup ",
    "although not strictly a single beam experiment as the probe laser was split into two beams that crossed the cylindrical burner at different angles  to extract relative predissociation rates of oh in a flame.@xcite the simultaneous measurement of the absorption via crd and the fluorescence from similar probe volumes allowed an accurate calibration of the relative predissociation rates and quantum yields .",
    "et al . _  measured absorption and fluorescence excitation spectra of cabr and cai with a celif type setup to obtain relative quantum yields within individual vibrational bands .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how the lif and crd measurements were calibrated with respect to each other , in particular , as only some spectra were measured concurrently.@xcite the experiments by hagemeister _",

    "deployed a similar experimental approach to the one described here to measure relative single - vibronic level fluorescence quantum yields of tropolone and tropolone - water clusters.@xcite however , in order to extract accurate relative quantum yields knowledge of the wavelength dependent mirror transmission is required , see eq .",
    "[ eq : ilif_approx ] .    in the following",
    "we describe how celif can be used to measure absolute fluorescence quantum yields in a self - calibration scheme with rayleigh scattering . considering equations [ eq : slif ] and [ eq : ilif_approx][eq : alpha_lif ]",
    ", the absorption coefficient is @xmath101 performing a rayleigh scattering measurement ( where @xmath102 ) with the celif setup , the rayleigh scattering coefficients , @xmath103 , can be extracted from the simultaneous crd measurement or from known rayleigh cross sections and sample densities .",
    "the fraction @xmath104 is the calibration factor @xmath105 .",
    "the absolute fluorescence quantum yield , @xmath106 , is then obtained from a subsequent celif measurement using the above calibration , @xmath107 where the absorption coefficient , @xmath108 , is determined from the ring - down time .",
    "strictly , the above equation neglects the wavelength dependence of @xmath16 caused by the potentially different response of the detector and the collection optics to the rayleigh scattered light and the fluorescence spectrum .",
    "compared to a crd measurement , celif can be used over a wider range of wavelengths using the same set of cavity mirrors .",
    "the sensitivity of crd cruicially depends on the large effective path length given by the high mirror reflectivity .",
    "following the derivation of eqs [ eq : ilif_approx ] and [ eq : celif_norm ] , the celif signal is largely independent of the mirror reflectivity and as a consequence the useful wavelength range of the mirrors is extended . in particular , once the wavelength - dependent calibration factor @xmath109 is established , the celif measurement is independent of the mirror characteristics .    in summary , in a well characterized lif setup , where the geometric factor of the detection system , @xmath16 , is known , the three variables that determine the lif signal are the cross section , @xmath7 , the sample density , @xmath8 , and the fluorescence quantum yield , @xmath15 . as outlined above , knowledge of @xmath110",

    "the benefits of a celif setup can easily be gained on an existing crd experiment . to extend such a setup with lif detection ,",
    "the only additions to the system are collection optics , a photodetector and a recording channel .",
    "this straightforward and fairly low - cost addition increases the dynamic range of the previous crd experiment by multiple orders of magnitude . in turn",
    ", a new stand - alone lif setup requires very careful calibration to measure absolute quantities where the challenge remains that most of these calibrations are based on separate measurements where sample and laser beam are similar but not identical . adding a cavity and crd detection to the lif setup provides an _ in situ",
    "_ absolute calibration of the lif measurement .",
    "we have demonstrated how a conventional , pulsed crd setup can be extended by fluorescence detection in a straightforward manner that combines the advantages of both the crd and lif techniques .",
    "the celif technique uses the same laser beam and sample in the cavity .",
    "its simultaneous absorption ( crd ) and fluorescence ( lif ) detection allows a rigorous absolute calibration of the lif measurement at sample densities that lead to a measurable reduction in ring - down time .",
    "this calibration can subsequently be applied across the entire lif dynamic range . from the calibrated lif signal , absolute quantities such as the fluorescence quantum yield , absorption cross section and sample density can be extracted . in our experiment , we have shown how the limited dynamic range of the crd measurement can be extended by at least three orders of magnitude towards lower absorbances , where the change in ring - down time is too small to be detected .",
    "celif very elegantly overcomes two main obstacles of single - pass lif .",
    "the cavity very effectively suppresses stray light allowing detection on the laser excitation wavelength .",
    "the probe laser pulse is stretched in time and the resulting decrease in laser intensity reduces saturation .",
    "our measurements show how celif improves the signal - to - noise ratio when compared to our single - pass lif spectrum .",
    "we believe that celif is most suited for localized sample volumes , such as molecular beams or surfaces , where crds can not fulfill its full potential due to the small absorption path length .",
    "in our respective research areas , we apply celif to molecular spectroscopy in supersonic beams and dynamics at surfaces . other research fields where absolute spectroscopic quantities such as cross sections and quantum yields are required include astrochemistry , atmospheric chemistry and plasma physics / chemistry . for the more recently evolved research area of cold and ultra - cold molecules ,",
    "the measurement of absolute densities of molecules in a trap is important .",
    "for example , in order to control the outcome of chemical reactions at sub - kelvin temperatures with external fields , samples densities will need to be increased to @xmath111  @xmath97.@xcite the extended dynamic range of the celif technique is perfectly suited to follow the time evolution of absolute trap densities .",
    "we believe that celif is an elegant , easy to implement and cost effective way to gain these absolute quantities over a large dynamic range and we hope that it finds applications in many research fields .",
