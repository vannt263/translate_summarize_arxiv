    "higgs production has been shown to be sensitive to the polarization of gluons , even in collisions between unpolarized protons such as at the lhc @xcite .",
    "gluons with nonzero transverse momentum with respect to the proton momentum can be linearly polarized @xcite , which affects for instance the transverse momentum distribution of produced higgs bosons .",
    "although the amount of polarization is currently unknown , it is known that it is at the very least perturbatively generated @xcite and , therefore , nonzero .",
    "there are also strong indications that at small momentum fractions @xmath1 the linear polarization becomes maximal @xcite .",
    "if sufficiently large , the polarization offers a new tool to analyze higgs couplings to the various standard model particles into which it can decay @xcite . to describe the effects of this gluon polarization , the formalism of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution functions ( or tmds , for short )",
    "is natural to consider , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this has been studied for the particular case of higgs production in refs .",
    "@xcite and including the effects of tmd evolution in refs .",
    "it turns out that at the higgs mass scale @xmath2 of about 125 gev , the effects of linear gluon polarization are not expected to be large , at the few percent level most likely .",
    "moreover , the effects are largest at small values of the transverse momentum of the higgs , i.e.  a few gev , where the cross section is difficult to measure . in the present paper",
    "we consider an alternative offered by the production of a higgs in association with an additional jet , which has been widely studied without including gluon polarization , e.g.   refs .",
    "the effect of gluon polarization shows up in the transverse momentum distribution of the higgs plus jet pair , where the pair transverse momentum can be of the order of a few gev , while the separate transverse momenta of the higgs and the jet can be substantially larger .",
    "the invariant mass of the higgs plus jet system will be even larger than @xmath2 , but the advantage is that a range of scales is now accessible , as opposed to the very narrow range around @xmath2 accessible in higgs production . in principle , this range of scales offers a way to map out the tmd evolution , although the feasibility in practice remains to be seen .",
    "experimentally the limiting factors are the resolution of the transverse momentum of both the higgs and the jet and how well the jet direction coincides with that of the fragmenting parton . at cms",
    "the jet transverse momentum resolution at 10 gev is typically 1.5 gev and at 100 gev it is 8 gev @xcite .",
    "the ultimately achievable resolution on the higgs transverse momentum is not clear , but it is likely multiple gev . on an event - by - event basis",
    "the deviation of the jet axis as obtained by jet finding algorithms from the direction of the fragmenting parton , can also be as large as a few gev in transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "altogether these uncertainties in the pair transverse momentum can be substantial and the goal of obtaining several bins in the region up to say 10 gev will be quite challenging .",
    "a numerical study using a monte carlo simulation will have to be done to study the actual feasibility , but that is beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we focus on the cross section expressions and on the differences of the higgs plus jet process to higgs production and to some other similar processes , pointing out the advantages it in principle has to offer .",
    "in this paper we present the relevant expressions for higgs plus jet production in leading order and study the impact of the gluon polarization in two models for the gluon distributions involved .",
    "both models have the advantage that they allow to obtain analytic expressions , but we will mostly present numerical results to show the qualitative differences between the two cases more clearly .",
    "we also present results for angular distributions , which have the advantage of singling out specific contributions .",
    "although measurements of angular distributions generally require large statistics , probing a nonzero result may nevertheless be possible when integrating over transverse momenta up to some maximum value as suggested in ref .",
    "we study the process @xmath3 where the four - momenta of the particles are given within round brackets , and the higgs boson and jet in the final state are produced with momenta that have components in the plane orthogonal to the direction of the initial protons that are almost back to back . to leading order in perturbative qcd",
    "the reaction proceeds via the partonic subprocesses @xmath4 with parton @xmath5 fragmenting into the observed jet .",
    "specifically , the following channels can contribute : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fd ] . in the calculation of the scattering amplitudes ,",
    "we take the quark masses to be zero , except for the top quark mass @xmath9 .",
    "therefore the higgs boson can couple to gluons only via a top quark loop .",
    "we consider the limit @xmath10 in which this coupling can be approximated by a point interaction",
    ". the corresponding feynman rules of the effective lagrangian can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "furthermore , we perform a lightcone decomposition of the two incoming hadronic momenta , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , in terms of the light - like vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which satisfy the relations @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 the partonic momenta @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of the lightcone momentum fractions ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) and the intrinsic transverse momenta ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , as follows @xmath24 using @xmath13 and @xmath14 the lightcone components of any vector @xmath25 are defined as @xmath26 , while @xmath27 refers to the components of @xmath25 orthogonal to the proton momenta @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "addition of order @xmath188 terms that are dominant at large @xmath189 and that can be cast into the same convolution form  @xcite , allows to extend the integration region to all @xmath164 .",
    "however , this need not lead to a vanishing @xmath190-weighted integral . in order for linearly polarized gluons to not affect the @xmath164-integrated cross section , there should always be one node at least , but it may well be outside the tmd region , i.e.  in the region @xmath191 .",
    "this is why models for @xmath182 can lead to an @xmath141 distribution exhibiting any number of nodes in the tmd region .",
    "as the gaussian model has no significant contributions outside the tmd region , it does have to display two nodes in the tmd region , as we confirm it does .",
    "for the measurement of the effects discussed here , the jet transverse momentum resolution is an important factor .",
    "as the resolution scale is probably on the multiple gev level and the effects in the models are largest for @xmath164 values in the few gev region , it may be hard to experimentally probe the region of interest here .",
    "we note however that no experimental knowledge is available on the shape of the @xmath192 distribution , hence , there are no constraints available to bound or indicate the typical width of the distribution . in the models we have made specific assumptions ( @xmath127 gev@xmath128 in the gaussian+tail model and @xmath173 = 7 gev@xmath174 in the gaussian model ) which need not correspond to the actual distribution .",
    "the latter could be significantly broader than expected from intrinsic transverse momentum effects , due to multiple gluon emissions , just like nonperturbative effects can affect the @xmath193-boson production distribution at transverse momentum values well above a few gev .",
    "we therefore caution the reader not to take the @xmath164 ranges in the figures too literally .",
    "the models are intended to illustrate what kind of features can arise qualitative from linearly polarized gluons .",

    ". the gauge link structure of @xmath198 will be the same as that of @xmath199 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but @xmath200 has no analogue considered before . in any case , we expect that the @xmath201}(x , \\bm{p}_{{\\scriptscriptstyle t}}^2)$ ] distribution(s ) probed in @xmath202 are different from the one in @xmath203 .",
    "it is not clear at present how large quantitatively the differences between these distributions are in practice , but it should be kept in mind that @xmath48-even distributions do not require initial or final state interactions to be nonzero , unlike for instance sivers functions .",
    "the gauge link dependence need not be the dominant dependence therefore . as such , there is no reason to assume that they are very large or very small .",
    "this simply remains to be seen .",
    "given that there are sufficiently many processes sensitive to the linear gluon polarization , the size of the initial and/or final state interactions can , at least in principle , be extracted from experiment . as a final comment , we point out that there are at present no indications that factorization will be broken in the process @xmath204 due to color entanglement effects like in @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have considered linear gluon polarization effects in higgs plus jet production .",
    "compared to similar processes where a color singlet state plus a jet is produced , the case of higgs production is special .",
    "its large mass allows for an unsuppressed angular independent contribution in the region @xmath206 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : r0 - 2 ] ) .",
    "this is not the case , for instance , in heavy quarkonium plus jet production , where in addition issues related to color octet contributions ( even if suppressed ) may lead to complications regarding the factorization @xcite .",
    "other color singlet state plus jet production processes , such as on- or offshell ( drell - yan @xcite ) photon plus jet production , or @xmath207 or @xmath193 boson plus jet production , are not sensitive to @xmath208 , but only to @xmath209 .",
    "this also applies to higgs production in association with a photon , @xmath207 or @xmath193 boson .",
    "the @xmath210 and @xmath211 processes have been investigated in great detail already , but without inclusion of polarization effects ( of quarks in this case ) @xcite .",
    "we point out that to probe @xmath209 the best processes probably are still the drell - yan process as suggested in ref .  @xcite or photon plus jet production @xcite .",
    "moreover , we note that the process higgs plus @xmath207 boson receives a contribution from @xmath209 only proportional to the very small higgs coupling of the light quarks inside the proton and can therefore rather be viewed as a cross - check process .",
    "linear gluon polarization effects in other color singlet pair production processes have been studied , i.e.  diphoton production in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath99 plus photon production in ref .",
    "@xcite , but as mentioned those studies were done in the collins - soper frame , where the restriction @xmath212 is not imposed or automatically respected .",
    "the numerical results obtained in those studies do not show a clear advantage over higgs plus jet production , giving similar or smaller values for the angular asymmetries .",
    "the lower energy and the better transverse momentum resolution could provide a big advantage though .",
    "when it comes to probing the linear polarization of the gluons , higgs plus jet production has some additional features compared to inclusive higgs production .",
    "one is the possibility of probing a continuous range of hard scales , allowing , at least in principle , for a study of tmd evolution .",
    "this is not possible in higgs production , where the hard scale is fixed to be @xmath2 .",
    "another is that , because the higgs - jet system can be in various angular momentum states , angular distributions can be probed that are not accessible in inclusive higgs production where the recoiling jet is not observed .",
    "thanks to this , effects involving only one initial linearly polarized gluon can be probed through the @xmath0 distribution , as in @xcite .",

    "<S> it is found that the @xmath0 distribution may be the most promising observable , as it is driven by only one initial linearly polarized gluon . </S>",
    "<S> the potential advantages of the higgs plus jet process compared to other processes sensitive to the linear polarization of gluons are discussed . </S>"
