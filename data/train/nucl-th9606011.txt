    "currently new accelerators are being built at cern ( `` large hadron collider '' , lhc ) and at brookhaven ( `` relativistic heavy ion collider '' , rhic ) , which allow heavy ions up to lead and uranium to be accelerated to highly relativistic energies .",
    "the main motivation for this is to advance into regions of baryonic densities and temperatures in order to observe the formation of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "but this has also renewed the interest in studying pure electromagnetic processes in these collisions , especially the electron - positron - pair production in peripheral collisions , where both ions do not interact with each other .    on the one hand pair production in central collisions",
    "is a signal one wants to use in order to study the properties of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the pure electromagnetic pairs are a large background process to these . on the other hand these processes",
    "can also be studied already in existing accelerators ( `` super proton synchroton '' , sps ) @xcite .",
    "recently anti - hydrogen atoms were produced at lear ( `` low energy antiproton ring '' ) in a similar process , where antiprotons in collisions with xenon produce electron - positron pairs , where the positron is not produced as a free particle , but is captured in a bound state of the antiproton @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of this problem goes back to the beginning of qed @xcite .",
    "but it was remarked only recently that calculations in lowest order perturbation theory violate unitarity @xcite . in the meantime",
    "several authors have studied this problem and found that this means that the production of multiple pairs becomes important then .",
    "all found that the @xmath0-pair creation probability can be written approximately in the form of a poisson distribution , which then restores unitarity @xcite .",
    "it was shown that generally the @xmath0-pair amplitude can be reduced to the product of the vacuum amplitude and the antisymmetrised product of @xmath0 reduced one - pair amplitudes .",
    "the neglect of exchange terms in the calculation of the probability then leads to a poisson distribution @xcite .",
    "corrections to this poisson distribution were calculated in the case of two - pair production and were found to be small ( around 1% ) , its importance decreasing also with higher lorentz factors .",
    "whereas large impact parameter contribute to the single - pair production , the @xmath0-pair production with increasing @xmath0 is dominated mainly by small impact parameters , smaller than the compton wavelength of the electron .",
    "thus the `` equivalent - photon - approximation '' ( epa ) can not be used anymore but exact calculations of the reduced probability are needed , since the momentum of the virtual photon is not small compared to the electron mass .    in sec .",
