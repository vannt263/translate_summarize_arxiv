    "the double - degenerate ( dd ) merger was suggested as a possible channel for type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) in the early 1980 s @xcite . in this dd model , two carbon - oxygen ( co ) white dwarfs ( wds ) can produce a sn  ia while merging if their total mass is larger than the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the dd model can naturally explain the lack of h and he emission in the spectra of sne  ia and some super - luminous sne  ia , but it has a major difficulty in explaining the similarities of most sne  ia since the merger mass has a relatively wide range , @xmath3 @xcite @xcite . ] .",
    "meanwhile , although the sne  ia rate predicted from the dd model is comparable to that of observations @xcite , theoretical studies suggest that the merger of two wds is more likely to lead to an accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) to form a neutron star @xcite . consequently , the dd model has been disadvantaged in comparison to the single - degenerate ( sd ) model for a long time @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that , under the right conditions , the dd merger process could be quite _ violent _ and lead to a sn ia explosion rather than aic ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "fully three - dimensional simulations of a violent merger of two co wds by @xcite show that the merger of two equal - mass co wds ( @xmath4 ) can explain the formation of sub - luminous 1991bg - like events ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the @xcite simulation of a dd merger with masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 shows good agreement with properties of normal sne  ia .",
    "observationally , some known or potential dd systems such as wd 2020 - 425 @xcite , v458 vulpeculae @xcite , sbs1150 + 599a @xcite and gd687 @xcite represent good candidates for sn  ia progenitors since they have total masses close to @xmath2 and orbital periods short enough to merge within a hubble time .",
    "furthermore , extensive searches have found no surviving companion to the type ia supernovae responsible for snr 0509 - 67.5 @xcite or sn 1572 @xcite , whence it is argued that the progenitors must have been dd systems .",
    "hence , it appears that at least some , if not most , sne  ia come from dd mergers .",
    "previous studies for the dd model generally assume that a sn  ia is produced if the total mass of a dd system is larger than @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption implies that the dd merger process is always conservative .",
    "however , if accretion is spherically symmetric , mass transfer can be dramatically non - conservative both during stable mass transfer and in a violent merger .",
    "@xcite ( hw ) studied the stability and energetics of mass transfer in double wds .",
    "they showed that the expelled mass fraction of an interacting double wd depends on the component masses and can be as large as 50% of the donor for a system with masses of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "meanwhile , smoothed - particle - hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations @xcite have shown that not all double co wds with a total mass larger than @xmath2 can produce sne  ia .",
    "for example , @xcite find that only double co wds in which the more massive white dwarf exceeds @xmath4 and the mass ratio roughly exceeds 0.8 robustly reach the conditions required for initiating a detonation , leading to a sn  ia explosion .",
    "obviously , some additional constraints should be placed on the dd model for triggering sne  ia .",
    "in sect.2 we investigate the merger mass of double wds including non - conservative mass transfer , and we examine the impact of these constraints and those arising from sph simulations on the sne  ia birthrate in sect.3 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect.4 .",
    "as the orbit of a double wd system decays due to the emission of gravitational radiation / waves , the less massive component will be the first to fill its roche lobe and become the mass donor ; the more massive component becomes the accretor . unlike non - degenerate donor stars in other compact binaries , the wd donors in double wds lie deeper within the potential well of the accreting star , resulting in important consequences for mass transfer . assuming energy conservation and hence no energy sources other than gravitational potential energy are at play",
    ", hw analyzed the initial stability of this mass transfer and the fraction of the mass - transfer stream to be expelled from the binary .",
    "from this point of view , the mass transfer is conservative if the accretion luminosity is less than the eddington limit .",
    "any accretion luminosity in excess of the eddington limit is assumed to be absorbed in the accretion flow . in terms of energetics ,",
    "radiative losses represent accretion energy not used to power a mass outflow ( hw : eq ( 21 ) ) .",
    "the fraction of matter accreted by the primary is used to power the outflow and can be determined from hw : eq ( 22 ) . for component masses @xmath10 ( accretor ) and @xmath11 ( donor ) ,",
    "we adopt hw : eqs ( 17 ) , ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) to calculate the mass transfer rate , @xmath12 , and the fraction of matter to be accreted by the primary may not be appropriate .",
    "] , @xmath13 .",
    "there are two regimes for computing the final total mass of the merger , @xmath14 .",
    "if the merger process is dynamical , @xmath13 can be applied as a single step process and @xmath15 .",
    "if mass transfer is stable , @xmath14 is obtained by integrating over the mass - transfer epoch , using @xmath16 .",
    "to investigate the sn  ia birthrate due to dd mergers , we require a population of close double co wd binaries , to be formed from interactions in a population of primordial binary stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we first perform a monte - carlo simulation to obtain a stellar population , then evolve them in a rapid binary evolution code ( rbec ) @xcite to obtain a sample of close co wd systems .    in the monte carlo simulation , all stars",
    "are assumed to be members of binaries and have circular orbits .",
    "the primaries follow the initial mass function of @xcite and are generated according to the formula of @xcite , in the mass range 0.08 to @xmath17 .",
    "the secondary mass , also with a lower limit of @xmath18 , is then obtained from a constant mass - ratio distribution .",
    "the distribution of orbital separations @xmath19 is taken to be constant in @xmath20 for wide binaries .",
    "this separation distribution has been used in many monte - carlo simulations and implies an equal number of wide binary systems per logarithmic interval and approximately 50 per cent of stellar systems with orbital periods less than 100 yr @xcite .",
    "long - orbital - period binaries are effectively single stars .",
    "the formation of close double co wd systems depends significantly on the critical mass ratio for dynamical instability @xmath21 and common envelope ( ce ) evolution @xcite .",
    "a binary experiences stable roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) when @xmath22 and ce evolution otherwise , where @xmath23 donor / accretor . in this study",
    "we adopt equation ( 57 ) of @xcite for @xmath21 when the mass donor is on the first or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and let @xmath24 when the mass donor is on the main sequence or in the hertzsprung gap , as supported by detailed binary evolution studies @xcite . for ce evolution , we use the standard energy formalism @xcite , that is , the ce is ejected if @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the orbital energy released , @xmath27 is the ce ejection efficiency , and @xmath28 is the binding energy of the envelope and can be written as @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass , envelope mass and radius of the donor , respectively , and @xmath33 is a structure parameter that depends on the evolutionary stage of the mass donor ) .",
    "we combine @xmath27 and @xmath33 into one free parameter , setting @xmath34 to reproduce the number of the dd objects in the galaxy as in previous studies @xcite .",
    "rbec distinguishes three types of wds , namely helium ( expected only in binaries ) , co and oxygen - neon ( one ) , respectively .",
    "the critical condition for co and one wds is the core mass at the base of agb , @xmath35 .",
    "co wds are produced when @xmath36 , and one wds when @xmath37 , where @xmath35 is given in eq ( 66 ) of @xcite .",
    "the mass of the co core , and the final mass of co wds is determined by the @xmath38 relation , i.e. eqs(37 ) and ( 39 ) of that paper .",
    "there are two basic constraints on double co wds as the progenitors of sne  ia in the conservative case : ( i ) @xmath39 following @xcite . ] , and ( ii ) the co wds are close enough to merge in a hubble time .",
    "the timescale for two components to merge by gravitational wave radiation , @xmath40 , is written as @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the orbital period in hours , @xmath40 in years and @xmath10 , @xmath11 in solar mass .    in the _ non_-conservative case ,",
    "( i ) should be redefined as the final mass @xmath43 * ( see sect .",
    "2)*. furthermore , aic should be avoided in order to successfully trigger a sn ia .",
    "we therefore need additional constraints from dynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite showed that an initial detonation at the onset of c ignition can lead the dd merger to avoid aic and explode , and that dds with @xmath44 and a mass ratio @xmath45 can achieve conditions for initiating such a detonation .",
    "their studies also showed that mergers with @xmath46 are very promising candidates for explaining _ subluminous _ sne  ia , while a _ normal _ sn  ia can be produced from the double co wds with @xmath47 .",
    "since the sn ia luminosity is determined by the amount of @xmath48 synthesized in the explosion , these simulation results seem to indicate that the primary mass is related to the final production of @xmath48 , and therefore determines whether a normal or sub - luminous sn  ia is produced .",
    "meanwhile , we _ do _ see a lot of variation in sn ia lightcurves , and thus one might expect to see a variety among exploding wd masses provided by the dd models . in the absence of other constraints",
    ", we study the sn  ia birthrate assuming two lower mass limits for the dd accretor , i.e. @xmath49 or @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "another constraint from the sph simulations is the mass ratio of the co dds , @xmath51 .",
    "it has a critical value , @xmath52 , below which the merger is not violent enough to ignite a detonation ( pakmor et al .",
    "2011 ) probably changes with primary wd mass ; i.e. more massive primaries can merge with lower mass ratios . ] .",
    "the relation between the violence of a merger and the mass ratio can be simply understood from fig . 2 of hw .",
    "in the dynamical instability region , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the adiabatic mass - radius exponent of the donor and the mass - radius exponent of its roche radius , respectively . with the mass ratio closer to unity ,",
    "the value of @xmath56 becomes larger and larger .",
    "since it is a negative number , the process of self - amplifying @xmath57 ( eq ( 1 ) in that paper ) is thus faster and faster , resulting in a more and more violent merger process .",
    "we arbitrarily relax the critical mass ratio from 0.8 to 2/3 in our study to give an upper limit for the sn  ia birthrate from the sph simulations .    in brief , based on the sample of double co wds which can merge in a hubble time ,",
    "we compute the sn  ia birthrate for the following cases :    \\(i ) @xmath58 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath59 ;    \\(iii ) as case ( ii ) with @xmath60 .",
    "we choose case ( ii ) as the basic constraint since it includes a larger parameter space than case(i ) ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the overall sne ia rate from case ( ii ) can then be considered as an upper limit from the non - conservative assumption .",
    "\\(iv ) similar to ( iii ) but @xmath61 , and    \\(v ) an additional constraint , @xmath62 , is placed on case ( iii ) .",
    "figure 1 shows these constraints in the @xmath63 plane ( left panel ) , as well as co dds with a total mass @xmath64 which can merge in a hubble time ( right panel ) . to obtain these dds ,",
    "we generate a population of @xmath65 binaries ( with a total mass of @xmath66 ) as described in sect.3.1 and evolve them in rbec .",
    "these dds cover a wide range in the @xmath63 plane , and also a large range of @xmath13 . for @xmath67 ,",

    "the shape of this distribution is consistent with both theoretical analyses and observations ( see maoz et al . 2011 ; wang & han 2012 and references therein ) .",

    "( 2012 ) that an extended envelope enshrouding the merging wds is not produced in violent merging events . however , we consider the possibility that a hot extended envelope may arise following a non - violent non - conservative dd merger .",
    "since the disrupted material of the secondary must also contain most of the original orbital angular momentum , the outermost layers of the merger probably form a centrifugally supported disc .",
