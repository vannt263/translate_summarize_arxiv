    "one of the most important probes of cold atom systems is time - of - flight imaging . turning off all trapping potentials , a cloud of cold atoms expands for tens of milliseconds , and an absorption image is taken . in the far field limit , the resulting image can be directly interpreted as the momentum distribution of the original cloud , _ if _ interactions among the atoms can be neglected during the expansion . here",
    "we critically evaluate the validity of neglecting such interactions during the expansion from an optical lattice .",
    "the question of how to interpret time - of - flight images is crucial .",
    "these images have been used , for example , to distinguish the mott insulating and superfluid phases @xcite .",
    "they have also been proposed as a tool to detect vortices in rotating condensates  @xcite , and are a crucial component of more sophisticated probes such as modulation spectroscopy @xcite and bragg / raman spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "interactions between cold neutral atoms are parameterized by the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 , which is typically on the order of @xmath2 nm @xcite .",
    "the scattering length is almost always very small compared to the distance @xmath3 between sites in an optical lattice , @xmath4 nm , where @xmath5 is the wavelength of the laser used to create the optical lattice  @xcite . the scattering length can , however , begin to approach the size @xmath6 of the atomic states in one well . for example",

    "thus when a few particles occupy a single site , their interactions are significant  @xcite .",
    "experiments have measured the resulting energy shifts  @xcite , and recently used them to study atom number statistics  @xcite . while these on - site interactions are important , by the time",
    "the wave - packets have expanded enough to overlap with neighboring sites , interactions are greatly attenuated .",
    "hence in our analysis we include interactions between atoms expanding from the same site , but neglect all inter - site interactions .",
    "thus we are able to investigate whether interactions during the initial expansion period affect the interference image .",
    "our estimate of the role of interactions is a lower bound ; there may be further interaction effects during later stages of the expansion .",
    "most importantly , interference effects could lead to strongly interacting high density regions at intermediate times  @xcite .    within our approximation",

    "as we discuss in section  [ phase ] , interactions play a much larger role in 1d expansion than in 3d , and fang et al . consequently found nearly a factor of two attenuation of the central bragg peak compared to the noninteracting gas .",
