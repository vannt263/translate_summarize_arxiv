    "the electron ( positron)-proton collider facility at desy , nicknamed hera ( for hadron electron ring accelerator ) has , since its inception in 1992 , given many new and interesting results from the two experiments h1 and zeus .",
    "these experiments have thrown up a wealth of new theoretical issues pertaining to low @xmath2 qcd .",
    "these experiments cover both the deep - inelastic region ( dis ) and the photoproduction region .",
    "the basic interaction picture is the usual dis diagram shown in figure 1 for the process @xmath3    the following kinematic variables completely describe the process : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the cm energy squared , @xmath6 is the energy of the initial ( scattered ) electron , @xmath7 the angle of the scattered electron in the lab frame with respect to the proton direction , @xmath8 is the negative of the momentum transfer squared to the proton , @xmath9 is the fraction of the electron energy carried by the virtual photon in the proton rest frame , the bjorken variable @xmath2 is the fraction of the proton energy carried by the struck quark and @xmath10 is the hadronic invariant mass .",
    "the masses of all particles are neglected .    at hera , a 27 gev electron beam collides head - on with an 820 gev proton beam giving @xmath11 which is much larger than hitherto obtained at fixed target experiments .",
    "( since 1994 , the electron beam has been replaced by a positron beam at the same energy ) . as a result the two experiments h1 and zeus can measure the structure function @xmath0 in a completely new @xmath12 domain ( see figure 2 ) .    the born cross section for single photon exchange in dis is given by @xmath13f_2(x , q^2)\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the photoproduction cross section ratio for longitudinal and transverse polarised photon , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14 has not been measured at hera ; therefore a qcd prescription based on parametrisation of parton densities is used .",
    "@xmath8 is directly measured from the scattered electron but @xmath2 is calculated from @xmath8 and @xmath9 and therefore depends on the experimental resolution of @xmath9 .",
    "the data for @xmath17 from h1 and zeus @xcite is shown in figures 3 , 4 , and 5 , along with some of the older fixed target data .",
    "it is clear that at fixed @xmath8 , @xmath0 rises with decreasing @xmath2 down to the smallest @xmath8 , the steepness of the rise decreasing with decreasing @xmath8 . similarly at fixed @xmath18 @xmath0 rises with @xmath8 , the rise becoming steeper as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "( we shall henceforth drop the superscript @xmath19 on @xmath0 since all our discussion henceforth will refer to the structure function of the proton ) .",
    "in fact , as seen in figure 4 , upto @xmath20 the data favour a parametrisation based on a soft pomeron such as that suggested by donnachie and landshoff @xcite . for larger values of @xmath8 ( @xmath21 )",
    "the usual qcd based parametrisations of grv or mrs @xcite give a good description of the data .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath8 for selected values of @xmath2 is presented in figure 5 .",
    "the growth of the structure function with @xmath8 for @xmath22 over three orders of magnitude in @xmath8 is clearly seen . with the new data from hera",
    "the gap between fixed target and the hera experiments has been filled and the remarkable agreement with a nlo qcd fit performed by h1 over three decades in @xmath8 and over four decades in @xmath2 is clearly seen .",
    "the h1 experiment has parametrised the rise of @xmath0 with @xmath2 by @xmath23 at fixed @xmath8 values .",
    "the result for @xmath24 as a function of @xmath8 is shown in figure 6 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath24 increases with increasing @xmath8 reaching a value of around @xmath25 around @xmath26 .",
    "the structure function @xmath27 is given in terms of the parton distributions @xmath28 the evolution of the structure function @xmath0 as a function of @xmath8 is governed , in perturbative qcd , by the dokshitser - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite , @xmath29 \\otimes \\left(\\begin{array}{c}q \\\\ g\\end{array}\\right ) \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the quark and gluon distributions , @xmath32 denotes convolution with respect to @xmath2 , i.e.@xmath33(x)\\equiv\\int_x^1 { dy \\over y}f({x\\over y})g(y)$ ] , @xmath34 is the number of flavours of quarks , @xmath35 is the electric charge of the quark @xmath36 .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath37 s at leading order are @xmath38 at higher orders , they depend on the specific factorization scheme . in the common parton scheme",
    "the above remains true to all orders .",
    "the splitting functions have the expansion @xmath39 the first two terms above define the nlo dglap evolution .    the rise of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath2 is explained by the usual dglap evolution and also by more non - conventional dynamics like the bfkl evolution @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review the two different approaches .    to understand the leading log summation technique in the dglap approach , we use the dokshitzer method @xcite . at low values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the gluon is the dominant parton in the proton .",
    "he showed that the glap summation of the @xmath40 terms amounts to a sum of gluon ladder diagrams of the type shown in figure 7 with @xmath41 gluon rungs .",
    "the form of the gluon splitting function @xmath42 for small @xmath2 gives the evolution of the gluon distribution function as @xmath43    it is clear that the @xmath44 builds up from the nested @xmath45 integrations .",
    "in fact this contribution comes from a region where the transverse momentum of the emitted gluons are strongly ordered @xmath46 similarly , the @xmath47 term comes from the region where the longitudinal momentum fractions are strongly ordered @xmath48 in the region of small @xmath2 the @xmath49 terms have also to be summed . with the assumption of @xmath50 approaching a constant ,",
    "say @xmath51 the result we get is @xmath52^n\\right\\}\\left\\{{1\\over n!}\\left[\\log\\left ( { 1\\over x}\\right)\\right]^ng_0\\right\\ } \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & & \\sim g_0\\exp\\left\\{2\\left[\\frac{3\\alpha_s}{\\pi}\\log\\left(q^2\\over q_0 ^ 2\\right ) \\log \\left(1\\over x\\right)\\right]^{1\\over 2}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit of large @xmath8 and small @xmath2 .",
    "this is an example of an all order double leading log ( dll ) summation of @xmath53 obtained by summing the strongly ordered gluon ladder diagrams as we have just explained .",
    "it tells us that as @xmath2 decreases , @xmath54 increases faster than any power of @xmath49 but slower than any power of @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 then we lose one power of @xmath57 .",
    "however , at small @xmath2 , this can be compensated by a large @xmath49 factor .",
    "relaxing the strong ordering constraint on the @xmath58 s and summing just the @xmath49 in the small @xmath2 region will give us the leading log summation in @xmath49 instead of dll and we get @xmath59^n \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\sim \\exp\\left[\\lambda \\log\\left({1\\over x}\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\sim x^{-\\lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 .",
    "this difficult summation was done rigorously by balitskij , fadin , kuraev and lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath61 and so , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "we have highly simplified the discussion of the bfkl equation , and in practise one needs to work in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath64 and integrate @xmath65 to get the final gluon distribution .",
    "we thus have two different predictions for the rise of @xmath0 , the dll ( from the dglap evolution equations ) and the bfkl . in principle",
    "it should therefore be possible to distinguish between these predictions by looking at the @xmath0 data from hera .",
    "unfortunately this is not that simple .",
    "the steepness of the rise of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath2 can be controlled by varying @xmath66 , or the starting distribution @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , the set of equations based only on @xmath0 measurements is underconstrained and one needs one other measurement like the longitudinal structure function @xmath68 in order to constrain the system fully .",
    "the net consequence of the above is that the present data on @xmath0 does not distinguish betweem the bfkl and dglap ( or for that matter the ccfm which embodies both ) predictions .",
    "we would like to mention here a suggestion by mueller @xcite on measuring an observable that is less inclusive than the @xmath0 measurement ( in which none of the properties of the hadronic final state is measured ) .",
    "he suggests studying dis events at small @xmath2 containing an identified high - energy jet emitted close to the jet of proton fragments ( see figure 8) .",
    "the identified jet originates from the parton labelled @xmath69 .",
    "if we study events with @xmath70 large ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath2 very small ( @xmath72 ) the ratio @xmath73 will be sufficiently small to reveal the @xmath74 behaviour of the bkfl ladder .",
    "details may be found in the references mentioned above .",
    "this study is currently under way and preliminary results are reported in @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 as a function of both @xmath8 and @xmath2 ( for large @xmath8 and small @xmath2 ) can be neatly combined through the double asymptotic scaling analysis of ball and forte @xcite .",
    "they use the two variables @xmath75 with @xmath76 the strong coupling constant evaluated upto two loops .    the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath66 have to be determined experimentally .",
    "@xmath66 is found to be @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath0 is rescaled by the leading asymptotic factors @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 the above constants are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 . also , @xmath34 is the number of flavours and @xmath88 .",
    "thus the function @xmath89 is predicted to rise linearly with @xmath90 and @xmath91 is expected to be independent of @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "figure 9 shows the data for these two predictions .",
    "the first graph is for @xmath93 .",
    "approximate scaling is observed for @xmath94 and @xmath95 . at high @xmath92 and low @xmath8 , the data tends to violate the predicted scaling behaviour .",
    "the second graph shows the appropriate data for @xmath95 and @xmath96 as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "the predicted linear rise is seen with slope of @xmath97 in good agreement with the qcd expectation of @xmath98 for @xmath99 flavours .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 130,310)(*a * )    ( 0,0 ) ( 130,190)(*b * )    [ fig 9 .",
    "]    thus in the low @xmath2 , high @xmath8 region beyond @xmath96 , scaling is seen in the two variables @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "the prediction of double scaling is in very good agreement in this region with experiment . beyond the double scaling region",
    ", the evolution continues to be in excellent agreement with the full nlo qcd evolution prediction .",
    "one of the by - products of the measurement of the structure function @xmath0 and its @xmath57 evolution is that the gluon distribution inside the proton has been measured with greater accuracy ( _ cf . _",
    "figure 5 in @xcite ) .    to summarise this section ,",
    "the structure function @xmath0 has been found to rise steeply with decreasing @xmath2 down to @xmath8 as low as @xmath100 .",
    "this rise can be parametrised by a form @xmath101 where @xmath24 is found to be a function of @xmath8 and reaches a value of around @xmath25 around @xmath102 .",
    "this behaviour is described very well by conventional nlo qcd ( through the dglap equation ) .",
    "however this does not rule out the existence of non - conventional dynamics like bfkl because the system is underconstrained .",
    "thus some other measurement which is less inclusive than @xmath0 like the forward jet mentioned above , or a measurement of the longitudinal structure function @xmath68 is required . in any case",
    ", some new physics must take over at sufficiently low @xmath2 otherwise the indefinite rise of @xmath0 would violate the unitarity bound .",
    "a study of the longitudinal structure function in the double scaling limit may be found in @xcite .",
    "in approximately 10% of the events used to study @xmath0 , a large rapidity gap in the hadronic final state was observed between the photon and the proton fragmentation regions .",
    "this is described in figure 10 .",
    "these events were fairly independent of @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that there is no energy or colour flow between the struck parton and the proton remnant direction .",
    "a generic explanation of these events is through the exchange of a colour singlet parton which is typically a pomeron .",
    "such events are typical of diffractive events through which one introduces the idea of the pomeron . for our purposes , the pomeron is the generic name for a particle the exchange of which is responsible for these large rapidity gap events .",
    "one of the simplest ways to understand these processes is to consider @xmath103 scattering in the rest frame of the proton . here , the life time of a @xmath104 fluctuation of the virtual photon is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the mass of the proton .",
    "this time scale corresponds to a distance of @xmath107 for @xmath108 which is much larger that the typical size of a hadronic target .",
    "thus the photon may fluctuate into a @xmath109 pair before arriving at the target , thereby making @xmath103 interaction similar to hadron hadron interaction .",
    "diffractive scattering emerges as a consequence of the hadronic nature of the virtual photon .",
    "it is important here to present the appropriate kinematic variables for the process .",
    "we use the variables @xmath110 for the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the generic pomeron @xmath111 , and @xmath112 the fraction of the pomeron momentum carried by the struck quark with @xmath113 , @xmath2 being the usual bjorken variable . neglecting the mass of the proton and taking @xmath114 , ( see figure 10 ) @xmath115 assuming the validity of regge factorization for @xmath103 diffractive interactions we have @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the flux of the pomeron in the proton .",
    "the dis differential cross section for producing a diffractive hadronic state @xmath118 of mass @xmath119 is @xmath120   f_2^{d(3)}(\\beta , q^2,x_{\\pom } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] @xmath121 denotes the contribution of diffractive events with a given @xmath110 integrated over @xmath122 to the proton structure function @xmath0 for a given @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "this part of the structure function is related to the pomeron structure function @xmath123 by @xmath124 where @xmath125 independent of @xmath112 and @xmath8 .",
    "h1 has carried out measurements of @xmath126 in the range @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 and this is shown in figure 11 .",
    "the pomeron trajectory fit corresponds to an intercept @xmath130 which is somewhat higher than the intercept of a soft pomeron ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the result from zeus is similar @xmath132 the quantity @xmath133 is directly proportional to @xmath123 and is found to be almost independent of @xmath8 .",
    "this can be explained only by a large gluon contribution ( see @xcite for details ) . in fact more than 80% of the pomeron momentum is carried away by hard gluons in the range of @xmath8 being studied .",
    "to summarise , the pomeron , which is a generic term to describe a colour singlet particle with vacuum quantum numbers , seems different in different processes . in particular",
    ", the pomeron in these diffractive events with large rapidity gaps seems to be harder than the usual soft pomeron of donnachie and landshoff @xcite .",
    "using dglap evolution it is found that the effective pomeron is made of mostly hard gluons .",
    "it is clear however , that the pomeron is not a universal object and has different intercepts in different processes .",
    "even though a photon , being a gauge particle has no intrinsic structure , its hadronic fluctuations ( through its interaction with matter ) give it a partonic structure .",
    "hard scattering processess ( jets and charm production ) yield tests of perturbative qcd at nlo and give information about the quark and gluon structure of the photon .",
    "we will very briefly touch upon some of these matters .",
    "large @xmath134 dijet photoproduction takes places at leading order through the direct scattering process @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "there are also so - called resolved processes ( at higher order ) @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the momentum fraction of the photon constituent can be recontructed from the transverse energies and rapidities of the dijets , @xmath139 thus , direct processes have @xmath140 and resolved processes @xmath141 .",
    "the angular distribution of the dijets can also be measured to provide information on the nature of the hard scattering process .",
    "in fact the expected difference in distribution between direct and resolved process can be clearly seen in the data and is again in good agreement with nlo qcd predictions .",
    "there are also a host of other results both from h1 and zeus .",
    "a good summary of the results and their theoretical implications can be found in the report of the photoproduction working group of the hera workshop on proton , photon and pomeron structure function @xcite .",
    "the detectors at h1 and zeus have the ability to study the nature of the hadronic final state in detail . as a result",
    "there has been renewed interest in the study of production at hera .",
    "the production cross section for the process is dominated by photoproduction i.e by the interaction of almost real photons @xmath142 .",
    "the process @xmath143 can take place through various mechanisms .",
    "the elastic process corresponds to @xmath144 for which there are various models proposed , in particular the soft pomeron picture of donnachie and landshoff @xcite and the ryskin model @xcite .",
    "the ryskin model is based on perturbative qcd and is an attempt to describe a hard pomeron through a gluon ladder of the bfkl kind .",
    "the elastic process can be with proton dissociation or without .",
    "in both cases , with small momentum transfer , the particle retains the full photon energy ( @xmath145 with @xmath146 in the proton rest frame ) .",
    "production with proton dissociation also leads to @xmath147 values close to one even though its strictly speaking , an inelastic process .",
    "however the principle inelastic process is that of photon - gluon fusion which has been modelled by berger and jones @xcite who calculated this in perturbative qcd due to the hard scale given by the mass of the charm quark . in the colour singlet model for photoproduction of which",
    "is based on the berger - jones picture , the formation of the state is accompanied by the emission of a hard gluon .",
    "a comparison of the colour singlet model to data gave a discrepancy in absolute magnitude which was attributed to missing higher order calculations ( also called the `` k - factor '' ) .",
    "subsequently , several improvements including a complete nlo calculation @xcite have been performed and compared successfully with the data .",
    "the possibility of colour octet contributions have also been studied - for an overview , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "all these various processes are shown diagramatically in figure 12 .",
    "there is not enough space to show the data for production .",
    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for data and experimental details .",
    "we will only briefly describe the data .",
    "the data show a rise with @xmath148 which in the hera regime can be modelled by @xmath149 .",
    "a fit to the hera data gives @xmath150 ( including systematic and statistical errors ) .",
    "using also the zeus data and lower energies , gives @xmath151 .",
    "the energy dependence from the donnachie - landshoff @xcite soft pomeron model corresponds to @xmath152 .",
    "the donnachie - landshoff prediction falls well below the data by a factor of 3 or so .",
    "the prediction of the qcd - based model of ryskin and including higher order corrections @xcite gives much better agreement in general .",
    "the ryskin model , based as it is on a 2 gluon ladder , depends quadratically on the gluon distribution taken at the scale @xmath153 .",
    "the distribution at this scale can be parametrised by @xmath154 . for values of @xmath155",
    "the gluon distribution from mrsa @xcite corresponds to @xmath156 which gives good agreement with data between 10 and 150 gev .",
    "the grv parametrisation @xcite corresponds to @xmath157 giving a curve with a somewhat steeper energy dependence than the data .",
    "the inelastic data sample is selected by requiring @xmath158 to reject elastic ( diffractive ) and resolved photon events .",
    "the inputs are the charm mass @xmath159 , @xmath160 and the renormalisation scale is chosen to be the factorisation scale @xmath161 .",
    "once again the gluon distributions at low @xmath2 can be parametrised by @xmath154 with @xmath24 ranging from 0 ( mrsd0 ) @xcite to 0.4 ( mrsg ) @xcite .",
    "approximate agreement is seen , however the data cover a wide range in absolute normalisation . since the nlo corrections are not fully under control for @xmath162 and @xmath163 , a restricted kinematic sample with @xmath164 and @xmath165 has been studied by experimentalists .",
    "there is improved agreement for all the gluon distributions but the sensitivity is reduced .",
    "again , details may be found in @xcite .",
    "an application of the asymptotic form of the gluon distribution as obtained from the double scaling limit to both the inelastic and elastic regions may be found in @xcite .",
    "to summarise , once again , the agreement with data is very good with standard gluon parametrisations , provided a hard pomeron ( as that built up of gluon ladders as in the ryskin model ) is used .",
    "this picture explains the diffractive / elastic events far better than the soft pomeron version of donnachie and landshoff @xcite . in the elastic case",
    "the berger and jones picture using the colour singlet model of production seems to give a satisfactory description of the data once nlo corrections are included and suitable cuts on @xmath147 and @xmath166 are incorporated .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 has now been measured in the kinematic range @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the rise of @xmath0 with decreasing @xmath2 is well explained by conventional dglap evolution but also by non - conventional dynamics like bfkl .",
    "a less inclusive measurement is required to distinguish these different evolution equations .",
    "the large rapidity gap events and diffractive scattering show that the ( generic ) pomeron is differrent in different processes but is harder than the donnachie - landshoff soft pomeron .",
    "exclusive vector meson production also indicates that both for inelastic and elastic / diffractive events , perturbative qcd based descriptions explain the data fairly well .",
    "lep and hera have also given us the low @xmath2 regime of the partonic structure of the photon , even though lack of space has not allowed me to discuss these aspects .",
    "the next frontier is that of polarised dis at low @xmath2 .",
    "the hermes experiment is a step in that direction .",
    "the large body of theoretical work on low @xmath2 has given us a good understanding of qcd dynamics at large parton densities .",
    "as a result , parton densities are now available over a large range in @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results from hera have given us new ways to connect partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom and contributed to a major improvement in our understanding of the short distance structure of hadrons .",
    "low @xmath2 qcd is one of the few areas of particle physics where theorists have had to work hard to keep up with experimentalists .    due to constraints of space ,",
    "i have left out many other aspects of hera physics , like photon structure functions , charged current interactions , some aspects of jets in photoproduction etc .",
    "the hera workshop on proton , photon and pomeron structure @xcite discusses in detail many of the issues touched upon here as well as some of the other experimental results that have not been discussed here .",
