    "modern observational astronomy , apart from yielding a series of sensational experimental findings , has posed serious problems for the conventional cosmology , and fundamental interaction physics as a whole .",
    "so , an interpretation of the revealed effect of the accelerated universe expansion [ 1,2 ] within the scope of a conventional cosmological model has required the use of such equations of state for the gravitating substance ( dark energy , quintessence ) which are not in line with any of the observable types .",
    "however , just this substance should make the major part ( up to three fourths ) of the total energy content in the universe .",
    "such a situation is liable to stimulate the development of alternative approaches including the efforts to modify the dynamic principles of a gravitation theory ( see , for example , [ 3,4 ] and references herein ) .",
    "but the well - known historic precedent with the space filling by unobservable luminiferous ether suggests that , trying to find dynamic explanations for the `` strange '' observable effects of new kinematics , the researchers inevitably come across serious difficulties and paradoxes .",
    "let us recollect the effect of the accelerated universe expansion , purely from the viewpoint of observation .",
    "in the fundamental experiments realized using the @xmath1 - type supernova as standard candles it has been found that over the interval of the cosmological red shift @xmath2  there are specific deviations from a linear hubble law .",
    "they are characterized by a marked maximum close to @xmath3 @xmath4 [ 1,2 ] and show tendency to monotonic decrease [ 5 ] . aside from pure photometric parameters ,",
    "the principal quantity directly recorded during the experiments is a frequency shift in the electromagnetic signals arriving to the observation point from recessing sources . and it is only natural to assume that the observed phenomenon is mainly caused by the propagation features of free electromagnetic radiation in the expanding space , i.e. the effect may be kinematic rather than dynamic in its nature .",
    "because of this , we should look for the key to its explanation in the kinematic principles of cosmology .    unfortunately , the problem of isolating the kinematic component in the structure of gr is far from unambiguity characteristic for spetial relativity ( sr ) . in fact , it is a matter of some or other geometry selection for the background space - time manifold , i.e. space - time in the absence of gravitating sources and of a gravitation field per se ( `` empty '' universe ) . within the scope of a conventional approach ,",
    "such a geometry is identified ( locally ) with that of the minkowski space , where the corresponding group of isometries offers invariance of the light - cone equation as one of the basic kinematic principles of sr ( synchronization condition of the spatially separated mutually stationary clocks ) .    in conditions of the spatial curvature approximating zero",
    ", it seems reasonable to retain the key invariance condition for the light cone equation in the case of the nonstationary spatial scales as well .",
    "it is commonly known that an extension of the minkowski - space symmetry group meeting this condition is the conformal group so(4,2 ) including , aside from isometries , the transformations which modify the space - time scales .",
    "in addition to lorentz transformations ( lt ) as a subgroup , the group so(4,2 ) also includes a group of special conformal transformations ( sct )",
    ". the metric form of minkowski space    @xmath5    is invariant relative to lt    @xmath6    i.e. the following equality is valid :    @xmath7    as regards sct of the form    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    @xmath10  four - vector parameter , the metric lorentz invariant is multiplied by the lorentz - invariant coordinate - dependent factor , and we have    @xmath11    but as seen from ( [ eq3 ] ) , with regard to @xmath12 in both cases the conditions @xmath13 are mutually determined .",
    "this is a well known case of the light - cone equation invariance both with respect to lt and sct .    from the viewpoint of conformal geometry",
    ", the propagation of electromagnetic signals in the case of expansion must follow the same laws as in minkowski space - time , i.e. should be realized at a uniform speed along the light - cone generators in each pair of the reference systems ( rs ) selected in the background space - time and related by lt and/or by sct .",
    "an experimental checking of the cosmological expansion law presupposes an independent determination of the galactic objects recession speed and of the distance from each of the objects to the observation point .",
    "in so doing the most informative and exactly measurable quantity is a frequency shift in the arriving electromagnetic signals .",
    "a theoretical description of the expansion fitting the observations adequately may be obtained with the expressions defining the explicit frequency - shift dependence for a relative velocity of the radiation source and detector as well as for the distance covered by the signal from the moment of its emission to the observation time .",
    "the formula relating the ray relative velocity v@xmath14 of the source and detector to the red shift @xmath15 is well known from a relativistic theory of doppler effect    @xmath16    this formula remains applicable with the expansion too .",
    "in this work the formula describing the explicit red - shift dependence for the distance covered by a signal in the expanding space , and also the expressions for hubble law have been derived directly from the conformal group transformations taking into account the light - cone equation , i.e. in a pure kinematic way .",
    "it has been found that the obtained relations are associated with the luminosity distance represented as an explicit function of the red shift involving no other parameters but the scaling factor @xmath0 .",
    "these relations represent , in a complete agreement with observations , the revealed transition of the metagalaxy to expansion , making it possible to verify experimentally the predictions concerning the observable deviations of hubble law from a linear behavior over a wide interval of the red shift .",
    "first , let us present an elementary derivation of the formulae , expressing the red - shift dependence of the recession speed and of the distance covered by a signal in conditions of the expanding universe , directly from the conformal group transformations .",
    "since within a spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model a leading role is played by the longitudinal motion component , for simplicity , we consider the case of one spatial dimension to define the four - vector @xmath17 as follows :    @xmath18    the vector of a relative velocity ( parameter of a group of lorentz boosts ) having a single component is given by    @xmath19    the four - vector @xmath10 of the group in sct ( formulae ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) ) , in accordance with [ 6 ] , will be taken in the form    @xmath20    where the parameter",
    "@xmath21 has the dimension of time . in our consideration",
    "it is convenient to use the light - cone variables    @xmath22    then lt([eq1 ] ) and sct([eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3 ] ) may be written as    @xmath23    where @xmath24 ;    @xmath25    an expression for the interval @xmath26 is of the form    @xmath27    the light - cone equation @xmath28 is written as    @xmath29    this equation has the following solutions :    @xmath30    @xmath31    for the variables @xmath32 , @xmath33 these solutions indicate the fulfillment of the relations in the cases ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) correspondingly    @xmath34    @xmath35    i.e. ( [ eq14 ] ) ( ( [ eq15 ] ) ) conforms to the signal propagation in the positive ( negative ) direction of the light - cone generators .",
    "next we use lt defined by formulae ( [ eq10 ] ) with due regard for ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) to find ( the upper and lower signs in formulae hereinafter are associated with the signal propagation in the forward and backward directions ) that    @xmath36    from the viewpoint of geometry , transformation ( [ eq16 ] ) represents a linear deformation of the light - cone generators for lt . in a similar way , with regard to ( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq15 ] ) , from formulae ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) we obtain    @xmath37    geometrically , ( [ eq17 ] ) denotes a nonlinear deformation of the light - cone generators  conformal transformation of a semi - infinite line to the finite length t@xmath38 ( upper sign ) and the inverse transformation ( lower sign ) .    from transformations ( [ eq16 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] )",
    "we get the following formulae for differentially small increments in time as follows :    @xmath39    @xmath40    taking @xmath41 and @xmath42 as oscillation periods of the emitted (  t@xmath43  ) and observed ( arriving to the observation point ) (  t@xmath44  ) signals and considering the relationship between the wavelength and oscillation period , we can derive the following expressions for the red shift case ( lower signs in ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) ) of interest :    @xmath45    @xmath46    solving relation ( [ eq20 ] ) with respect to @xmath47 , we obtain expression ( [ eq5 ] ) for the velocity @xmath48 . from ( [ eq21 ] )",
    "we can derive the following formula for the signal propagation time t(z ) :    @xmath49    taking into consideration a vanishingly small curvature of the modern metagalaxy , we can find the distance covered by the signal as    @xmath50    the parameter @xmath51 is easily related to hubble constant with regard to the fact that for small values of the red shift the experimentally observed dependence of the galactic recession speed on the intergalactic distance is linear @xmath52 to a high accuracy . as seen from formulae ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) , the expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath53 at @xmath54 are proportional to each other up to the factors @xmath55 . indeed , from ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq23 ] ) we derive    @xmath56    whence it follows that @xmath57    the expression for hubble law written as    @xmath58    is determined over the whole variation interval of @xmath15 .    in the approximation of @xmath59",
    ", it represents a linear form of hubble law @xmath60 .",
    "the function @xmath61 possess a maximum at @xmath62 , that surprisingly well agrees with a position of the experimentally found maximum for @xmath63 interpreted as a transition point from decelerated to the accelerated expansion of the universe [ 1 , 2 ] .",
    "yet , a direct comparison of expressions ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) with the experimental data presents difficulties .",
    "it is a standard practice in astronomy to use for description of the observable dependences the so - called luminosity distance given by    @xmath64    where @xmath65  luminosity of a distant radiation source , @xmath66  measurable energy flux from the source at the observation point .    on the other hand , in modern cosmology",
    "the basic relation relating the galactic red shift to the space - time characteristics of the expanding universe is as follows ( e.g. , see [ 7 ] ) :    @xmath67    here @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the values of the scaling factor a(t ) in the preceding ( @xmath70 and subsequent ( @xmath71 instants of time , @xmath15  red shift . using the distance determined as @xmath72 , we can write expression ( [ eq26 ] ) in the following form :    @xmath73    to associate expressions ( [ eq26 ] ) , ( [ eq27 ] ) with the observables , one can use taylor expansion of the scaling factor in terms of time ( actually , in terms of h@xmath74 t ) or @xmath75 , taking all time derivatives at the time of observation @xmath76 .",
    "note that only two first terms of the expansion involve the quantities well grounded within the scope of a conventional cosmological friedmann ",
    "walker ( frw ) model and included into the dynamic equations of friedmann .",
    "these quantities are ( i ) hubble parameter determining the expansion rate and given as    @xmath77    \\(ii ) deceleration parameter determining changes in this rate and given by the formula    @xmath78    in frw - model this parameter relates the sign and value of acceleration to the pressure and energy density of the gravitating matter .",
    "a dot over @xmath79 denotes differentiation in time . as seen from definition of ( [ eq29 ] ) , a positive ( negative ) value of q(t )",
    "is associated with decelerated ( accelerated ) expansion .",
    "the values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 taken in the time of observation @xmath82 , represent the measured hubble constant h@xmath74 and deceleration parameter @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "restriction to the first two terms in taylor expansion turned to be sufficient for the fulfillment of the condition @xmath59 .",
    "when proceeding to the region of greater values of @xmath15 , one should take into consideration further expansion terms leading to new , phenomenological , parameters ( jerk , snap , etc . )",
    "associated with time derivatives of the scaling factor higher than the second - order ( see [ 5 , 8 ] and references herein ) .    within the scope of a conventional friedmann cosmology , all expressions characterizing the space - time properties of the expanding universe are also dependent on @xmath84 and @xmath83 in addition to the variable @xmath15 .",
    "for example , an approximate formula for the signal propagation time , including the terms quadratic in @xmath15 , is of the form [ 7 ]    @xmath85    in frw - model the deceleration parameter is related to a dimensionless density of the matter @xmath86 where @xmath87  mean energy density in the universe and @xmath88  critical density , by means of the well - known relation    @xmath89    here @xmath90  numerical factor relating the pressure @xmath91 and energy density @xmath87 in the equation of state    @xmath92    assuming the observable acceleration to be a result ( outcome ) of total influence from ( of ) separate types of the gravitating substance and neglecting the contribution from ( of ) the relativistic gas @xmath93 let us write according ( [ eq31 ] )    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is cold matter density , including the dark one ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 is dark energy density ( @xmath98 ) .    to compare formula ( [ eq22 ] ) to expression ( [ eq30 ] ) ,",
    "let us perform a series expansion of the function @xmath99 limiting ourselves to the term quadratic in @xmath15 .",
    "as a result , we have    @xmath100    it is obvious that expressions ( [ eq30 ] ) and ( [ eq33 ] ) are coincident for @xmath101 . because of a vanishingly small spatial curvature of the modern metagalaxy the mean matter density is practically coinciding with the critical one",
    ". therefore we can assume    @xmath102    adding the equation ( [ eq32 ] ) under condition @xmath103 , i.e.    @xmath104    we can see that    @xmath105    these numerical magnitudes are near to ones which found experimentally ( @xmath106 ) [ 5 ]    it is seen that the exact formula given by ( [ eq22 ] ) for @xmath99 , derived proceeding from pure kinematic considerations , in the approximation under study represents the result that in a dynamic approach of gr is associated with a negative value of the deceleration parameter ( i.e. accelerated expansion ) and hence with a negative pressure in state equation ( dark energy effect [ 1 , 2 ] ) .",
    "the dependence given by formula ( [ eq22 ] ) arise in the case of frm - type metric with the scale factor @xmath107 which corresponds to the spacially - flat universe with @xmath108 ( see for example [ 13 ] ) . but",
    "this metric leads to purely decelerating expansion @xmath109 .",
    "it can be easily seen that just the same dependence @xmath99 can be obtained in the case @xmath110 too .",
    "such expression gives correct picture of the nowadays observable expansion ( the deceleration parameter is equal to @xmath111 ) .",
    "a standard practice in modern astrophysics is to represent the experimental hubble diagrams , giving the dependence of the luminosity distance d@xmath112 on the red shift , as a function @xmath113 ( distance modulus ) of the following form ( see [ 5 , 7 ] ) :    @xmath114    where d@xmath112 is measured in megaparsecs ( mpc ) .",
    "it should be noted that all the available expressions for the luminosity distance derived within a conventional approach of gr are dependent not only on the variable z but also on the additional varied parameters ( see [ 5 ] and references herein ) .",
    "now our problem is to express the luminosity distance d@xmath112 in terms of the distance d that is covered by a light signal , emitted in the remote past , to the moment of its recording at the observation point . in the absence of the closed - form analytical expressions relating the distances d@xmath112 and d , we can use the representation of d@xmath112 derived in the form of taylor expansion in powers of d up to the fourth - order terms [ 8 ] .",
    "we limit ourselves to the first two expansion terms since further terms ( beginning from the third ) include , apart from the hubble constant h@xmath74 and deceleration parameter q@xmath74 , the additional phenomenological parameters ( jerk , snap ) .",
    "the corresponding expression is of the form ( see [ 8 ] , formula ( 45 ) )    @xmath115\\left ( { \\frac{h_0 d}{c } } \\right)^2 } \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath116  curvature index , a@xmath74=a(t@xmath117  current value of the scaling factor . as the relation d@xmath112(d )",
    "is general in character , by substitution of @xmath118 , where the distance d(z ) is determined by ( [ eq23 ] ) , we can obtain an expression for the luminosity distance as a function of the variable z , that involves no other parameters except the common scaling factor @xmath119 . in the process",
    "we make allowance for the fact that the metagalaxy is spatially euclidean ( k=0 ) , also assuming @xmath101 in accordance with the foregoing .    as a result",
    ", we have the following explicit function @xmath120 :    @xmath121    where    @xmath122    specifying for h@xmath74 the numerical value @xmath123 , we can find @xmath124 .    then expression ( [ eq34 ] ) for the distance modulus @xmath125 may be rewritten as    @xmath126 } \\right\\ } + 25,\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 is determined by ( [ eq37 ] ) .    the function @xmath128(z )",

    "a more detailed comparison with the experimental data , let us consider the expression    @xmath131    where the function f(z ) is determined by ( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "this expression defines deviation of hubble law from a strictly linear behavior over the whole range of the red shift values .",
    "the multiplier 5 is used because this comparison is performed with the experimental data expressed in terms of @xmath132 , where @xmath128 is given by ( [ eq34 ] ) .",
    "note that expressions ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) used for definition of the function in ( [ eq39 ] ) have been obtained in the assumption of time independence for the hubble parameter .",
    "because of this , the corresponding formulae are obviously inapplicable for very great values of z. but we can assume that , for certain , their applicability region covers the red shifts on the order of several units .            the function @xmath133 over the interval @xmath130 is graphically shown in fig .  3 . for comparison ,",
    "4 gives the experimental residual hubble diagram borrowed from [ 5 ] ( see fig .  7 there ) and representing the observed dependence of deviations from a linear hubble law in the corresponding range of the measured red - shift values .",
    "here the diamonds and circles denote experimental points , the circles being associated with the red shifts in signals from sixteen supernovae ( sne ia ) detected during a period from 2002 to 2003 ( see [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the full circles at the bottom of this figure denote the mean weighted values calculated for several selected intervals of red shifts .",
    "a zero dotted line in both parts is associated with an `` empty '' model of the universe @xmath134and with the approximation linear in @xmath15 .",
    "the dashed line giving the best fit to the experimental data has been obtained for @xmath135 i.e. in the assumption that the total @xmath136 of the ordinary and cold dark matter comes to 27% , whereas a share of the dark energy @xmath137 amounts to 73% of the overall quantity of the gravitating substance in the modern universe .",
    "the solid thin lines above and below the zero line have been obtained within the scope of some alternative approaches , the predictions of which are at variance with the experimental data .    as seen , the curve ( [ eq39 ] ) shown in fig .",
    "3 represents well not only the maximum position and value close to the point @xmath138 but also the general form ( behavior ) of the observed dependence on @xmath15 , including a marked tendency of the experimental points to drift to the region of negative deviations for @xmath15 in excess of @xmath139 ( @xmath140  intersection point of the curve ( [ eq39 ] ) with the @xmath15-axis ) . as the amplitude and character of deviations for z values beyond the limits of the currently available experimental data",
    "are described by the explicit analytical function ( [ eq39 ] ) , the predicted further behavior of the associated curve may be experimentally checked directly in the process of detecting new , very remote , standard distance indicators ( ia  type supernovae ) .",
    "it should be particularly emphasized that the formulae proposed involve no free parameters and the predicted results are model - independent . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimentally observed pattern is represented within a standard cosmological model of gr by a choice of the appropriate combination of variable parameters whose number is growing with the red shifts .",
    "as demonstrated in [ 9 ] , the observed deviations of hubble law from a strictly linear relationship between the recession speed and cosmological distance are directly caused by different dependences of the functions @xmath48 and @xmath53 on the red shift . over the experimentally studied interval ( @xmath130 ) , for @xmath15 values",
    "this difference is minor ( below 5% ) . and",
    "it is interesting to compare the predictions calculated by formula ( [ eq39 ] ) with those obtained independently using the functions @xmath53 and @xmath141 as the distance - determining expressions .",
    "the corresponding expressions for deviations are written as    @xmath142    @xmath143    where @xmath144    fig .",

    "however , from table 1 it is seen that there are distinctions in the positions and values of these maxima .",
    ".the positions of maxima and corresponding values of the functions @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath147 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that a qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experiment when using formula ( [ eq39 ] ) is clearly worse when the functions given by ( [ eq40 ] ) and ( [ eq41 ] ) are used independently .",
    "this may be interpreted as a direct experimental support for the expression ( [ eq24 ] ) derived in [ 9 , 10 ] for the cosmological expansion law .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the observable features of a modern stage in the universe expansion may be described consistently as pure kinematic manifestations of the conformal space - time geometry .",
    "a non - euclidean character of the space - time background manifold in this approach is represented by a conformal inhomogeneity of time .",
    "of course , such a theoretical model looks like the phenomenological one .",
    "nevertheless , the model not only represents well the observable effects but also makes possible direct experimental checking with further progress of the experiments into the region of higher red - shift values . even the fact that within this model the derived explicit expressions for the cosmological expansion law and the relationships between the distance and red shift require no variable parameters for agreement with the observations suggests that this model actually represents the real properties of the metagalaxy at a modern stage of its expansion .",
    "besides , as shown in [ 9 ] ( see also [ 10,11 ] and the references herein ) , with the use of expression ( [ eq17 ] ) determining a conformal deformation of the light - cone generators we can , qualitatively and quantitatively , represent in the approximation @xmath153 the observed pioneer anomaly effect ( anomalous violet frequency shift in signals of the receding source ) as a universal local manifestation of the cosmological expansion , in principle , detected at other frequencies ( e.g. , optical ) as well .    it is important that the experimentally recorded local expansion effects may be interpreted as an exhibition of nonintertiality of the observer s reference system ( rs ) , `` expanding rs '' , in every point of which there is a background acceleration directed to the observation point , its numerical value being determined by the expansion rate ( i.e. by the observable hubble - parameter value ) .",
    "it is clear that , due to a pure kinematic character of the approach , in the proposed expansion pattern the gravitating sources and fields themselves are lacking . but",
    "gravity may be introduced on the basis of the equivalence principle as an effective background field whose `` strength '' , similar to the corresponding background acceleration that is equal to ch@xmath74 , is determined by hubble constant .",
    "the hubble constant in the proposed model is used as a limiting value of the parameter setting the fixed time scale that , together with the speed of light , gives the space - time dimensions of the observable universe . in so doing the status of the constants",
    "c and h@xmath74 is differing considerably .",
    "the upper limit of speed is fundamental in its character , being naturally involved in the principles of sr .",
    "however , no arguments for the possibility of bounds on a numerical value of hubble constant as an inference from some general physical principle have been found .",
    "this problem necessitates special attention .",
    "it seems that most promising in this respect looks the maximum tension principle put forward by gibbons [ 12 ] .",
    "as demonstrated by the estimates including a maximal force after gibbons ( @xmath154 , g  newton s gravitation constant ) , the energy density of the `` equivalent '' background gravitation field ( field strength @xmath155 may amount to two thirds of the critical density [ 11 ] . in other words ,",
    "such an `` acceleration field '' , in principle , may be taken as a real kinematic alternative of the dark energy .",
    "of course , beyond the scope of gr it is impossible to allow for noninertiality of observer s rs consistently from relativistic viewpoints .",
