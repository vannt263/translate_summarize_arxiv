    "the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite has opened a new opportunity in the search for physics beyond the sm . the sm predicts all couplings of the higgs to sm particles completely , and a measured significant deviation of higgs couplings from the sm prediction will be a clear signal of new physics .",
    "the most straightforward tests at the moment are comparisons of the higgs production rates times branching ratios to the sm prediction in a variety of final states . thus far",
    ", such global fits roughly agree with a sm higgs  @xcite .",
    "we can go further by testing the @xmath0 properties of higgs couplings .",
    "this test has already been done for the coupling of the higgs to electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite . in the sm , the higgs couples to the @xmath10 boson as a scalar , @xmath11 . in general",
    ", a higgs - like state could couple to @xmath10 bosons as a pseudoscalar , @xmath12 , or with any linear combination of scalar and pseudoscalar couplings , which would imply @xmath0 violation . in the fully leptonic channel for @xmath13 ,",
    "the azimuthal angle between the decay planes of the two @xmath10 bosons is sensitive to the @xmath10 polarizations , which in turn is sensitive to the @xmath0 structure of the higgs couplings  @xcite .",
    "current data disfavors a pure pseudoscalar coupling at 99.84% = 3.3 @xmath14 and 99.6% ( 97.8% ) confidence level using cl@xmath15 statistics at cms  @xcite and atlas mela ( atlas bdt )  @xcite , respectively .    in models where the sm is augmented by heavy new physics",
    ", this result is unsurprising .",
    "of the two possible interactions mentioned above , the scalar interaction is renormalizable , while the pseudoscalar interaction arises from a dimension six operator .",
    "the pseudoscalar coupling is thus expected to be subdominant in higgs decays and corresponding @xmath0 violating effects will be small . while current results favor a pure scalar coupling in the higgs couplings to weak gauge bosons , searches for @xmath0 violation in fermionic decays of the higgs are still highly motivated .",
    "such modified couplings can arise from a different source which , in particular , can give a pseudoscalar interaction comparable to a scalar , unlike the higgs-@xmath16/@xmath10 couplings .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the @xmath0 structure of the coupling of the higgs to tau leptons can be probed at present and future colliders .",
    "the higgs coupling to any fermion generally consists of a @xmath0 even and a @xmath0 odd term , @xmath17 measuring this @xmath0 phase @xmath18 requires knowledge of the spins of the @xmath19 state .",
    "tau decays are complex enough to retain non - trivial information about the direction of the tau spin , yet clean enough that the spin information is not washed out by hadronization effects as it is for @xmath20-quark decays  @xcite .",
    "since the higgs branching fraction to @xmath21 is substantial in the sm ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 gev ) , the @xmath21 decay channel is the best of a limited set of opportunities for @xmath0 violation searches in higgs couplings to fermions .",
    "in addition , a pseudoscalar - like coupling of the higgs to taus can conceivably compete with the small tau yukawa coupling , and so @xmath0 violating effects can be sizable .",
    "currently , the only direct bound on the higgs - tau coupling is on the net signal strength in @xmath24 channels : @xmath25  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will maintain @xmath26 and modify only @xmath18 , so this constraint does not apply .",
    "we focus on the specific tau decay channel @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "this is the most common tau decay sub - channel , with a branching fraction of @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the angular distributions of the tau decay products and subsequent rho decay products are correlated with the original direction of the tau spin , as we will see in section  [ sec : heuristic ] .",
    "the relative azimuthal orientation of the two hadronic taus , @xmath30 , which we will define precisely in section  [ sec : theta ] , contains information about the @xmath0 properties of the higgs coupling to taus .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 phase @xmath31 in the higgs couplings may be read off directly from the @xmath30 distribution .",
    "the differential cross section is shown analytically in  sections  [ sec : eandb ] and c to have the form @xmath32 , and @xmath31 may be measured by finding the minimum of the distribution ( as exemplified in figure  [ fig : true_varydelta ] ) .",
    "the dominant background for @xmath33 events at the lhc is @xmath34 , which produces a flat @xmath30 distribution .",
    "the ability to distinguish scalar versus pseudoscalar higgs couplings in the tau channel has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "our work quantitatively improves on these results : our @xmath30 variable is demonstrably more sensitive to the @xmath0 phase of the higgs coupling to taus compared to earlier proposed observables , and our simulation results for the ilc indicate a corresponding increase in sensitivity compared to earlier results .",
    "this work is also a qualitative step forward in that we propose a strategy to do this measurement at the lhc .",
    "previous studies relied on resolving a displaced vertex in @xmath1 decays which is challenging .",
    "we show that our observable retains sensitivity without this .",
    "it should be stressed that in order to reconstruct the angle @xmath30 , full knowledge of all four - momenta components in the event is needed , including those of the two neutrinos .",
    "we will discuss the challenges that this presents and how they may be addressed . in the context of a higgs factory ( ilc ) ,",
    "@xmath35 events may be fully reconstructed up to a two - fold ambiguity .",
    "furthermore , a favorable signal to background ratio makes our measurement straightforward . at a hadron collider , however , some approximations are needed for the neutrino four - momenta . employing the collinear approximation  @xcite",
    ", we show that the amplitude of the angular structure in @xmath30 is only reduced by an order one factor for @xmath33 signal events .",
    "the challenge for the lhc is thus to increase the signal to background ratio as much as possible in order to produce a statistically significant result .",
    "in addition , an improvement over the collinear approximation would make a positive impact on the resulting sensitivity to @xmath31 .",
    "our net result is that , using the @xmath30 variable , a measurement of @xmath31 with an accuracy of @xmath36 is possible for a @xmath37 gev @xmath38 collider , assuming 1 ab@xmath5 of luminosity ( without incorporating detector effects , which are expected to be negligibly small ) .",
    "this number should be compared with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , which quotes an accuracy of measuring @xmath31 to @xmath39 using the same amount of luminosity but for @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 gev .",
    "we also provide the first estimates for sensitivity to @xmath31 at the lhc . without incorporating detector effects or pileup",
    ", we find an ideal measurement of @xmath31 to an accuracy of @xmath42 is possible with 3 ab@xmath5 of @xmath43 tev lhc data for a @xmath1-tagging efficiency of 50% .",
    "improving the efficiency from 50% to 70% could lead to an accuracy of @xmath44 using the same lhc luminosity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : cpv_coupling ] we add @xmath0 violation to the higgs coupling to tau leptons . in section",
    "[ sec : observable ] we introduce our observable , first in a heuristic analysis that follows every step of the decay , and then rigorously , using the analytic form of the full @xmath45 differential cross section .",
    "we present the results of our collider analyses in section  [ sec : studies ] .",
    "we first present the relevant distributions using monte carlo truth information , then reevaluate in a higgs factory setup , where a twofold ambiguity needs to be considered , and finally consider an lhc setting using the collinear approximation .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "a weakly - coupled renormalizable model giving rise to @xmath0 violation in the higgs coupling to taus is presented in appendix  [ app : uvcompletion ] .",
    "[ sec : cpv_coupling ] in our study of the @xmath0 nature of @xmath47 , we use the following phenomenological lagrangian : @xmath48 where @xmath1 and @xmath49 are the physical tau lepton and higgs boson in the mass basis , respectively , @xmath50 is a real parameter parametrizing the magnitude of the @xmath51 coupling , and , most importantly , @xmath52 $ ] is an angle describing the @xmath0 nature of the @xmath51 coupling . can , in fact , take the full range of @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "however our technique is not sensitive to a multiplication of the tau yukawa by @xmath54 and so it is sufficient to consider half of this range .",
    "resolving this ambiguity would require measuring the interference of higgs with background , which is a tiny effect . ]",
    "the @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd cases correspond to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , while @xmath57 describe maximally @xmath0-violating cases .",
    "the sm corresponds to a special case , @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "we will refer to `` @xmath60 '' as a `` @xmath0-violating @xmath46 coupling '' , even though it includes the @xmath0-conserving limits of @xmath55 and @xmath61 . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the effects of @xmath18 , so we will take @xmath62 while treating @xmath18 as a free parameter .    the simplest fully gauge - invariant operator that results in the @xmath0-violating @xmath51 coupling  ( [ eq : lpheno ] ) upon electroweak symmetry breaking is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are _ complex _ dimensionless parameters , and @xmath66 is a mass scale taken to be real and positive without loss of generality .",
    "to relate the parameters of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we substitute @xmath69 in  ( [ eq : leff ] ) , which yields @xmath70 from which we identify @xmath71 and we have taken @xmath72 to be real and positive ( hence @xmath73 is real and positive ) without loss of generality after suitable redefinition of the phase of @xmath74 . with this phase convention ,",
    "the @xmath51 coupling in  ( [ eq : lpheno ] ) is generally complex : @xmath75 since @xmath76 , new physics at the tev scale ( @xmath77 ) with @xmath78 couplings ( @xmath79 ) can give rise to @xmath18 anywhere in the full range @xmath80 $ ] .. ] this is in stark contrast to the case of a @xmath0-odd / violating higgs coupling to @xmath10 bosons , where tev - scale new physics is expected to give only small corrections to the sm @xmath0-even coupling .",
    "[ sec : observable ] to probe the @xmath0-violating @xmath51 coupling in  ( [ eq : lpheno ] ) , we will study the following decay process : @xmath81 there are several good reasons to choose this decay chain .",
    "first , to minimize the loss of kinematic information due to neutrinos , we want both @xmath82 and @xmath83 to decay hadronically .",
    "second , of the hadronic decay modes , we choose @xmath84 , since the subsequent decay , @xmath85 , can be reconstructed at a collider .",
    "third , @xmath84 has the largest branching fraction of any individual tau decay mode , @xmath86% , and the following step , @xmath87 , occurs with a nearly 100% probability . finally , the @xmath88 width is sufficiently narrow that it is well justified to consider it on - shell , which makes the process in  ( [ eq : theprocess ] ) an analytically tractable sequence of 2-body decays .",
    "we begin with a heuristic look at the process in  ( [ eq : theprocess ] ) to develop a rough idea of how it can probe the @xmath0-violating @xmath89 coupling  ( [ eq : lpheno ] ) .",
    "in particular , the highlights of qualitative points to be made in sections  [ sec : h_to_tautau ] , a@xmath902 and a@xmath903 are :    * measuring @xmath1 helicities can not determine the @xmath0 phase , but the @xmath1 polarizations in directions _ perpendicular _ to the @xmath1 momenta can .",
    "* in the tau rest frame the @xmath88 is predominantly longitudinal and is polarized roughly in the direction of the @xmath1 polarization . *",
    "the difference between the charged and neutral pion 3-momenta , @xmath91 , is roughly parallel to the respective @xmath92 polarization .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 nature of @xmath93 must be encoded in the orientation of `` @xmath91 '' in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath94 momenta in the higgs rest frame .",
    "a precise form of `` @xmath95 '' as well as the best observable to measure the @xmath0 phase @xmath18 will be identified in sections  [ sec : eandb ] and c by analytically computing the full matrix element for the sequence of two - body decays in process  ( [ eq : theprocess ] ) .      [ sec : heuristic ]      [ sec : h_to_tautau ] the most general form of the amplitude for the decay @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the probability amplitude of @xmath82 and @xmath83 having helicities @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "lorentz invariance dictates that the proportionality factor omitted in  ( [ eq : m : h_to_tautau ] ) has no momentum dependence .    in the higgs rest frame",
    ", the amplitude  ( [ eq : m : h_to_tautau ] ) takes the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the @xmath82 momentum and energy in this frame , while @xmath105 is the linear combination of @xmath99 with angular momentum @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , @xmath107 the amplitude in  ( [ eq : m : h_to_tautau : higgs_frame ] ) shows that the @xmath0-even contribution ( @xmath108 ) is a spin triplet in a @xmath109-wave , while the @xmath0-odd contribution ( @xmath110 ) is a spin singlet in an @xmath111-wave .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of angular momentum conservation and fermi statistics , with the additional fact that a fermion  anti - fermion pair has an odd intrinsic parity .    to measure @xmath18 ,",
    "it is necessary to keep the @xmath112 pair in the above superpositions of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , without projecting the polarizations onto the helicity eigenstates . from  ( [ eq : m : h_to_tautau : higgs_frame ] ) and  ( [ eq : chi10_chi00 ] ) , we see that the coefficients of @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the complex conjugates of each other , which implies that , regardless of @xmath18 , the probability for both @xmath82 and @xmath83 to be right - handed is always equal to that for both to be left - handed .",
    "therefore , to distinguish the two linear combinations in  ( [ eq : chi10_chi00 ] ) , we must measure the polarizations in the directions _ perpendicular _ to the momenta , as mentioned in item 1 above .      assuming the sm weak interactions for the @xmath1 and @xmath116 , the most general form of the amplitude for @xmath117 is given by @xmath118 with @xmath119 .",
    "again , lorentz invariance dictates that the proportionality factor omitted in  ( [ eq : m : tau_to_rho - nu ] ) has no momentum dependence .    in the @xmath82 rest frame ,",
    "the amplitude  ( [ eq : m : tau_to_rho - nu ] ) has the form @xmath120 where @xmath121 $ ] is the angle between the @xmath122 momentum and the @xmath82 polarization in this frame , and @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the polarization vectors for the left - handed , longitudinal , and right - handed polarizations of the @xmath122 , respectively . since @xmath126 , the amplitude  ( [ eq : m : tau_to_rho - nu : tau_frame ] )",
    "is dominated by the second term , roughly speaking .",
    "thus , we are led to the picture described in the item 2 above , namely , the @xmath122 is predominantly longitudinal ( @xmath127 ) and mostly emitted in the direction of the @xmath82 polarization ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the most general form of the amplitude for @xmath129 is given by @xmath130 the other linear combination , @xmath131 , can not appear here because @xmath132 .",
    "again , the proportionality factor omitted in  ( [ eq : m : rho_to_pi - pi ] ) can not have any momentum dependence by lorentz invariance .    boosting the longitudinal @xmath122 to its rest frame , and neglecting the @xmath133-@xmath134 mass difference",
    ", the amplitude  ( [ eq : m : rho_to_pi - pi ] ) takes the form @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the angle between the original @xmath122 polarization and the vector @xmath137 in the rest frame .",
    "therefore , the momentum difference , @xmath138 , is roughly ( anti-)parallel ( @xmath139 or @xmath140 ) to the original @xmath122 polarization , as we described in the item 3 above .      [",
    "sec : eandb ] we now analytically compute the full matrix element for the process  ( [ eq : theprocess ] ) to identify the observable that is most sensitive to the @xmath0 phase @xmath18 . combining the amplitudes  ( [ eq : m : h_to_tautau ] ) ,  ( [ eq : m : tau_to_rho - nu ] ) and  ( [ eq : m : rho_to_pi - pi ] ) , the full amplitude for the process  ( [ eq : theprocess ] ) at tree level is given by @xmath141 where @xmath142 refers to the @xmath134 coming from the @xmath92 decay , respectively , and we have denoted @xmath116 and @xmath143 as @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively .",

    "all intermediate particles are assumed to be on - shell , so the denominators of their propagators have been dropped in  ( [ eq : fullm : initial ] ) , as they are just momentum - independent constants @xmath147 .",
    "* we neglect @xmath148 throughout the paper . a convenient consequence of this ( very good ) approximation is that the @xmath149 amplitude in  ( [ eq : m : rho_to_pi - pi ] ) effectively satisfies a `` ward identity '' , _",
