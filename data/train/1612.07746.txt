    "* preparation of a spin - imbalanced gas in an optical lattice * we realize the fermi - hubbard model using a degenerate mixture of two zeeman states ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 , numbered up from lowest energy ) in the ground state hyperfine manifold of @xmath23li placed in an optical lattice .",
    "the global spin imbalance @xmath79 can be varied continuously from 0 to @xmath25 while the temperature @xmath80 remains relatively unaffected .    to create the sample we load a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) from a zeeman slower , then use a compressed mot stage before loading into a @xmath81 deep optical trap and evaporating near the feshbach resonance .",
    "we stop the evaporation before feshbach molecules form and transfer the atoms to a highly anisotropic ` light sheet ' trap with aspect ratio @xmath82 where it undergoes further evaporation near where @xmath83 .",
    "next we transfer to the final trap geometry where a beam provides radial confinement and a accordion lattice with trapping frequency @xmath84 provides axial confinement ( for further details see @xcite ) .",
    "the spin populations are imbalanced by evaporating the mixture in a magnetic gradient of up to along the same direction as the magnetic bias field , which we set in the range 75- depending on the targeted imbalance .",
    "we then tune the bias field to set the scattering length and load into a 2d square lattice with a long ramp to a depth of @xmath85 .",
    "* details of the 2d lattice * we use a non - separable 2d lattice with spacing formed by four interfering passes of a single vertically polarized beam .",

    "here we have to take into account that the two incoming lattice beams are not exactly at a angle . to compensate the resulting tunneling asymmetry in the lattice and retain a symmetric lattice we attenuate the retro - reflected laser power .",
    "the potential at the atoms is given by      where we align the coordinate axes with the principle axes of the lattice .",

    "we experimentally compensate for the tunneling asymmetry by finding the retro - reflection power that gives symmetric tunneling by making the singles - density correlators equal along both lattice axes .",
    "we calibrate our lattice depth by measuring the frequencies of the three @xmath100 bands in a deep lattice using lattice amplitude modulation , and compare these with the 2d band structure calculation , including the measured lattice angle and the retro - reflection attenuation factor @xmath93 as a fit parameter . at the best fit @xmath101 , the inferred depth of the lattice at which our measurements are performed is  @xmath102 , where @xmath103 . from",

    "we also have a non - zero but negligible diagonal tunneling @xmath107 , due to the non - separability of the lattice    we measure the interaction energy @xmath0 using radio frequency spectroscopy .",
    "we transfer atoms from state @xmath108 to @xmath109 and resolve the frequency shift between singly and doubly occupied sites .",
    "we determine @xmath110 taking into account a small correction due to weak final state interactions .",
    "the experimentally measured value agrees with the value determined from band structure calculations including higher band corrections @xcite to within 10% .",
    "* measurement of spin correlations * after the imbalanced gas is loaded adiabatically into the optical lattice , we freeze tunneling dynamics by increasing the lattice depth within to 55 @xmath102 .",
    "after that , we convert the @xmath111 mixture to a @xmath112 mixture by driving a radio - frequency landau - zener transition between states @xmath113 and @xmath109 in with efficiency of @xmath114 .",
    "this step is necessary because an rf transition between state @xmath108 and @xmath113 is forbidden , so we can not perform pseudospin rotations with the @xmath115 mixture .",
    "next we hide all doublons in our sample by converting them to molecules , employing a ramp across a narrow feshbach resonance near . then we either drive a @xmath45 spin rotation to measure correlations for the spin component perpendicular to the effective magnetic field , or omit this to measure correlations for the spin component parallel to the field .",
    "we image the final atom distribution by increasing the lattice depth to 2500 @xmath102 within , ramping up the light sheet to provide axial confinement , and then collecting fluorescence photons during raman cooling .",
    "raman imaging is not spin sensitive , so to measure spin correlations we remove one spin state from the trap before imaging .",

    "the length of this pulse was determined by observing atom loss for different pulse lengths .",
    "the atom loss curve exhibits two well - separated time scales , which we interpret as resonant heating and off - resonant heating of the two spin states , and fit with the sum of two decaying exponentials @xcite .",

    "this is in contrast to the behavior observed during raman imaging , where doublons are lost through light - assisted collisions . as the spin correlator",
    "can not be easily extracted with the extra atoms from the doublon blowing , we hide doublons by ramping the magnetic field over the narrow @xmath128 feshbach resonance near thereby converting doublons to feshbach molecules before resonantly blowing .    to estimate the fidelity of doublon hiding , we first prepare a band insulator .",
    "we take images with neither doublon hiding nor blowing to determine the number of singles in the band insulator .",
    "we then compare this to the number of singles we observe after performing doublon hiding and removing one of the spin states with a blowing pulse , which leaves behind single atoms on sites where the doublon hiding failed .",
    "we find a doublon hiding fidelity of @xmath129 .    *",
    "raman imaging * we use a raman cooling scheme for lithium similar to the ones demonstrated before @xcite but with slight differences .",

    "the raman axis is along the diagonal of the square lattice and tilted about @xmath130 out of plane .",
    "the optical pumping beam is circularly polarized .",
    "we use a magnetic offset field of about which is in the plane of the lattice and perpendicular to the raman axis .",
    "the optical pumping beam is tuned to the red of the @xmath131 line .",
    "we typically operate with focused to a waist of about for the pump beam and focused to a waist of for each raman beam .",
    "we estimate our rabi frequency to be @xmath132 by measuring power broadened raman spectra for different powers .",
    "we perform raman imaging for and collect approximately @xmath133 photons per atom using a special optics custom objective with a working distance of @xmath134 mm . an achromatic doublet with @xmath135",
    "gives a magnification of @xmath136 , which we verified using kapitza - dirac scattering of a molecular bec .",

    "the formalism can be summarized in the following equation @xmath170 where @xmath171 , an extensive property per lattice site in the thermodynamic limit , is expressed in terms of contributions [ or weights , @xmath172 of all the clusters @xmath173 that can be embedded in the lattice and are not related by any translational symmetry .",

    "unlike in the htses , where @xmath177 are expressed as perturbative expansions in terms of powers of the inverse temperature , in the nlces , we obtain @xmath177 exactly ( to all powers in the inverse temperature ) using full diagonalization , leading to a better convergence .",
    "we use the site expansion nlce in which the results in the @xmath178th order contain contributions from all clusters with @xmath178 sites or less .",
    "we carry out the expansion to the 9th order . only in the last order , and for each of the two values of @xmath13 ( 8.0 , and 14.0 ) , we diagonalize the hubbard hamiltonian in the presence of a magnetic field for 112 topologically distinct 9-site clusters that have no particular symmetry . we choose a fine grid for the temperature and work in the grand canonical ensemble ; for @xmath179 at half filling , we fix the chemical potential and choose a fine grid for the magnetic field . similarly for @xmath180 away from half filling ,",

    "these allow us to have a high resolutions for the polarization and the density , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the converged results are valid in the thermodynamic limit and contain no systematic or statistical errors .",
    "however , due to the finite number of terms in our series the convergence is lost below a temperature that is dependent on @xmath13 , the polarization and the density . to extend the convergence to lower temperatures , we take advantage of numerical re - summation techniques . to minimize the possibility of introducing systematic errors",
    ", we use two vastly different algorithms , namely , wynn resummation with four cycles of improvement and the euler resummation for the last six terms in the series  @xcite , and present results when they agree within a few percent .    in the nlce",
    ", one can in principle compute correlation functions at distances as far as the largest clusters in the series extend .",
    "however , as this distance increases , a smaller number of clusters contribute to the series , and so , one should expect the lowest convergence temperature to increase with distance . in fig .",

    "<S> our quantum simulations qualitatively reproduce the non - monotonic behavior of the magnetic susceptibility with doping in the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the high effective fields reached in our experiments allow us to explore canted antiferromagnetism , physics that is inaccessible in the cuprates at laboratory magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> interesting future directions for both experimental and theoretical work include investigation of spin - imbalance in the attractive 2d hubbard model where fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov superfluid correlations should be detectable at the entropies achieved in repulsive experiments @xcite and study of the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the imbalanced repulsive gas @xcite which would require lower temperatures . </S>",
