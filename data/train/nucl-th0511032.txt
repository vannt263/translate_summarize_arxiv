    "it usually accompany the appearance of new periodic orbit from that local family ( or , inversely , disappearance of another periodic orbit into the family ) , namely bifurcation of periodic orbit occur at this point .",
    "one should also note that this periodic - orbit bifurcation is related with the restoration of local dynamical symmetry in neighborhood of the periodic orbit .",
    "since these quasi - periodic orbits make coherent contribution in the periodic orbit sum , we can expect a significant enhancement of shell effect in quantum level density .",
    "actually , our previous works@xcite clearly show that the bifurcations of short periodic orbits play essential role in emergence of gross shell structures .",
