    "the phase diagram structure of spin - glasses remains an open field of inquiry , since most approaches to the problem rely on approximations . any exact analytical result in",
    "this area is thus very valuable , both for the direct information it provides and as a test for approximation methods . over the last few years",
    "striking progress has been made combining the replica method , duality , and symmetry arguments  @xcite , an approach which has yielded the exact locations of the multicritical points in the ising and potts spin - glasses on the square lattice and in the four - dimensional random - plaquette gauge model .",
    "the most recent result in this series  @xcite is a general conjecture relating the multicritical point locations of any spin - glasses on a pair of mutually dual lattices . in support of the conjecture , estimates based on monte carlo simulations were given for ising spin - glasses , in @xmath2 , on the dual pairs of triangular and hexagonal lattices and , in @xmath3 , on the dual pairs of bilinear and lattice - gauge interactions on the cubic lattice . in both cases , within the numerical limitations ,",
    "the conjecture is approximately satisfied .",
    "we propose here to extensively test the conjecture in an alternative fashion using hierarchical lattices  @xcite , by looking at ising spin - glasses on mutually dual pairs @xcite of such lattices .",
    "these constitute ideal testing grounds , since an exact renormalization - group transformation for the quenched bond probability distribution can be constructed for such lattices , yielding global phase diagrams and critical properties .",
    "accordingly , the location of the phase boundaries and of the multicritical points are precisely determined .",
    "we thus investigate three pairs of hierarchical lattices , and in the end find that the conjecture is very nearly satisfied for all of them .",
    "the ising spin - glass is given by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 at each site @xmath6 , @xmath7 denotes a sum over nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , and the bond strengths @xmath8 are equal to @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 and @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 . the limits @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to purely ferromagnetic and purely antiferromagnetic systems respectively .    to give a brief overview of the conjecture ,",
    "let us consider the model on an arbitrary lattice , and treat the randomness through the replica method , where the system is replicated @xmath15 times and the @xmath16 limit is eventually taken , in order to get results for the physical system .",
    "the partition function of the @xmath15-replicated system after averaging over randomness , @xmath17 , can be expressed entirely as a function of @xmath18 `` averaged '' combinations of edge boltzmann factors , @xmath19 , associated with nearest - neighbor bonds  @xcite .",
    "these averaged boltzmann factors , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , have the form @xmath22 where the @xmath23th factor corresponds to a configuration with a parallel - spin bond in @xmath24 replicas and an antiparallel - spin bond in @xmath23 replicas  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath25    the partition function on the dual lattice , @xmath26 , can be expressed in a similar form , @xmath27 with the dual counterparts to the averaged boltzmann factors given by @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath30 are related as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant , which can be eliminated by using eq",

    "is too complicated to yield useful information relating the locations of phase transitions .",
    "however , the multicritical points in both original and dual systems are expected to lie  @xcite on the nishimori line  @xcite , which simplifies the relation .",
    "furthermore , the conjecture advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite states that , for the multicritical points @xmath41 of the original system and @xmath42 of its dual , eq .   is satisfied when the leading boltzmann factors @xmath36 from each side are equal , @xmath43 since @xmath41 and @xmath42 lie on the nishimori line , @xmath44 from eqs .",
    "and , eq .   gives @xmath45 finally taking the limit , @xmath46 , one obtains the condition @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "as expressed in eq .  , the conjecture is asserted to hold for multicritical points of ising spin - glasses on any pair of mutually dual lattices  @xcite .",
    "hierarchical lattices  @xcite are constructed by replacing every single bond , in a connected cluster of bonds , with the connected cluster of bonds itself , and repeating this step an infinite number of times .",
    "these provide models exactly solvable by renormalization group , with which complex problems have been studied and understood .",
    "for example , frustrated @xcite , spin - glass @xcite , random - bond @xcite and random - field @xcite , schrdinger equation @xcite , lattice - vibration @xcite , dynamic scaling @xcite , aperiodic magnet @xcite , complex phase diagram @xcite , and directed - path @xcite systems , etc . ,",

    "[ lfig1 ] , [ lfig2 ] , and [ lfig3 ] .",

[ lfig1]-[lfig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the hierarchical lattice construction process is reversed , as each connected cluster is replaced by a single renormalized bond .",
    "the decimation can be expressed as a mapping , @xmath54 where the set @xmath55 are all the bonds within the connected cluster of the original system and @xmath56 is the renormalized bond between sites @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the rescaled system . in the pure case ,",
    "all @xmath8 bonds are independent for @xmath59 , and the implementation of eq .",
    "is straightforward .",
    "when quenched randomness is added to the system , the renormalization - group transformation is expressed in terms of quenched probability distributions  @xcite , where the quenched probability distribution @xmath60 in the rescaled system is calculated from @xmath61 in the original system through the convolution @xmath62",

    "the recursion of the quenched probability distribution , eq .  , is implemented numerically .",
    "the probability distribution is represented by histograms , each histogram being specified by a bond strength and an associated probability .",
    "thus , for the spin - glass problem , the starting distribution consists of two histograms , one at @xmath63 with probability @xmath10 , and one at @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 .",

    "[ lfig3](a ) , the series is : ( i ) a bond - moving convolution of @xmath68 with itself , yielding @xmath69 ; ( ii ) a decimation convolution of @xmath69 with itself , yielding @xmath71 ; ( iii ) a decimation convolution of @xmath70 with @xmath78 , yielding @xmath72 ; ( iv ) a bond - moving convolution of @xmath72 with itself , yielding @xmath75 ; ( v ) a bond - moving convolution of @xmath75 with itself , yielding @xmath76 ; ( vi ) a decimation convolution of @xmath68 with itself , yielding @xmath79 ; ( vii ) a decimation convolution of @xmath80 with @xmath68 , yielding @xmath81 ; ( viii ) a bond - moving convolution of @xmath81 with @xmath76 , yielding @xmath77 . as for the dual lattices in figs .",
    "[ lfig1](b ) , [ lfig2](b ) , and [ lfig3](b ) , the series of pairwise convolutions are identical to their counterparts above , except that each bond - moving is replaced by a decimation , and vice versa .",
    "since the number of histograms that constitute the probability distribution increases rapidly with each renormalization iteration , a binning procedure is used when the desired ( large , namely up to @xmath0 ) number of histograms is reached : before every pairwise convolution , the histograms are placed on a grid , and all histograms falling into the same grid cell are combined into a single histogram in such a way that the average and the standard deviation of the probability distribution are preserved .",
    "histograms falling outside the grid , representing a negligible part of the total probability , are similarly combined into a single histogram .",
    "any histogram within a small neighborhood of a cell boundary is proportionately shared between the adjacent cells . in the current study",
    ", the binning procedure is done separately for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "after the convolution , the original number of histograms is reattained .    in the current study ,",
    "40,000 bins are generally used , representing the renormalization - group flows of 80,000 variables , requiring the calculation of 40,000 local renormalization - group transformations at each renormalization - group iteration .",
    "the numerical results converge rapidly with increasing bin number . for maximal accuracy in determining the exact locations of the multicritical points , in the immediate vicinity of these points we used at least 1,000,000 histograms , representing the renormalization - group flows of 2,000,000 variables , requiring the calculation of 1,000,000 local renormalization - group transformations at each renormalization - group iteration .",
    "it should thus be noted that our analysis is an exact numerical solution of ising spin - glasses on hierarchical lattices .",
    "and @xmath84 probability bins were used in ( a ) and ( b ) respectively . ]      global phase diagrams for the various hierarchical lattices are obtained from the renormalization - group flows of the probability distributions .",
    "each phase has a corresponding sink , namely a completely stable fixed distribution .",
    "the boundaries between phases flow to unstable fixed distributions , analysis of which yields the order of the phase transition and the values of the critical exponents of second- and higher - order transitions .",
    "all the phase diagrams are plotted in terms antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath12 versus temperature @xmath86 .",
    "the diagrams are symmetric around @xmath87 , with the ferromagnetic phase in the @xmath88 half - space mapping onto the antiferromagnetic phase in the @xmath89 half - space .",
    "thus in the figures only the @xmath88 portions are shown .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) show the phase diagrams for the dual pair of hierarchical lattices in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "the phase structure of both diagrams is topologically identical to that of the @xmath2 ising spin - glass on a square lattice , which is only natural considering that the @xmath2 , @xmath49 migdal - kadanoff recursion relations are exact on these hierarchical lattices.@xcite the @xmath13 transition temperatures of the two models are related by the duality algebra  @xcite      which is also true for the two other pairs of mutually dual hierarchical models .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath13 transition temperatures in fig .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) are related @xcite by @xmath91 since the mappings of the interaction constant in the repetition of renormalization - group transformations differs only by an initial bond strengthening by a factor of @xmath92 ; note that eq .",
    "does not apply to @xmath93 , since there the bond - moving is not a mere multiplicative strengthening , but a @xmath94-fold convolution of the probability distributions that alters this distribution in a non - simple way .",
    ".   is also not applicable to the two other pairs of mutually dual models , since the repetition of renormalization - group transformations are not differentiated by only a preliminary bond - moving .    in each of fig .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) , a ferromagnetic phase at low temperatures and low @xmath12 is separated from the disordered paramagnetic phase by two second - order phase boundaries , meeting at a multicritical point .",
    "( in a narrow neighborhood of all multicritical points in our results , reentrance is observed : paramagnetic , then ferromagnetic , then paramagnetic or spin - glass phases are encountered as temperature is lowered at fixed @xmath12 . )",
    "the two second - order boundaries flow to distinct unstable probability distributions with different critical exponents , constituting a strong violation of universality  @xcite and consistent with the prediction , generally , of the absence of first - order transition under quenched randomness in @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite as expected from symmetry considerations , the multicritical points fall  @xcite precisely on the nishimori line  @xcite as seen in table i. as also seen in table i , @xmath95 , so that the conjecture is realized to a very good approximation .",
    "5 shows the phase diagrams for the dual pair of hierarchical lattices in fig .  2 .",
    "while fig .",
    "5(b ) has the same phase topology as the diagrams in fig .  4",
    ", being at @xmath52 below the spin - glass lower - critical dimension , a different structure occurs in fig .",
    "5(a ) . here the @xmath3",
    ", @xmath49 migdal - kadanoff relations are exact on the hierarchical lattice , and for low temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath96 there exists a spin - glass phase .",
    "the multicritical point occurs where the ferromagnetic , paramagnetic , and spin - glass phases meet .",
    "as expected both multicritical points lie directly on the nishimori line . from table",
    "i we see that @xmath97 , so that the conjecture is realized to a very good approximation , even when the mutually dual models belong to different dimensionalities @xmath1 and have different phase diagram topologies at the multicritical points of the conjecture .    the phase diagram structures in fig .  6 , corresponding to the dual pair of hierarchical lattices in fig .  3 , are similar to those of fig .  5 , illustrating dimensions above and below the spin - glass lower - critical dimension .",
    "again the multicritical points for both cases lie directly on the nishimori line . in this case @xmath98 , and the conjecture is realized to a very good approximation , again for mutually dual models belonging to different dimensionalities @xmath1 and having different phase diagram topologies at the multicritical points of the conjecture .",
    "thus , we find that for all three mutually dual pairs of hierarchical lattices , the conjecture relating the locations of the multicritical points is satisfied to a very good approximation .",
    "this is all the more remarkable , since , as seen in table i , the contributions of @xmath99 and @xmath100 to the conjecture are strongly asymmetric . however , it should be noted that ( 1.0172,0.9829,0.9911 ) , while being very close to 1 , are different from integer 1 . in our numerical implementation of the convolutions of the probability distributions ,",
    "the results have converged to the precision of the digits shown in table i. further increase of the already very large number of probability bins does not change the entries in the table .",
    "further tests of the conjecture , using other systems , would be very useful .",
    "similar to our current study , the use of hierarchical lattices to study phenomena linked to mutually dual lattices , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , would also be very useful .",
