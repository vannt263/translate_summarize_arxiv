    "understanding the evolution of dwarf galaxies , and , in particular , the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies , has implications for our understanding of important processes in galaxy evolution , stellar nucleosynthesis , and the enrichment of the intergalactic medium . while a general relationship between galaxy luminosity and current metallicity has been well established for all galaxies , the fundamental underlying process ( or processes ) is still debated .",
    "the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies are also far from well understood .",
    "is it possible for dwarf galaxies to form in the current epoch , or are the identities of all dwarf galaxies established at early times ?",
    "can massive star formation result in the instantaneous enrichment of the interstellar medium of a dwarf galaxy , or is the bulk of the newly synthesized heavy elements released into a coronal gas phase which must cool before becoming incorporated into the other phases of the ism and eventually the next generation of stars ? by studying extreme dwarf irregular galaxies , i.e. , the lowest luminosity , lowest metallicity and lowest mass star forming systems , we can extend the baseline for comparative studies of galaxies and test simple hypotheses of the formation of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is particularly important for studying the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies , as the impact of a given episode of star formation on a dwarf galaxy will be maximal for the lowest luminosity and metallicity systems . in principle , this could lead to the largest deviations from the luminosity - metallicity relationship , and this , in turn , may lead to a better understanding of that relationship .",
    "gas phase abundances are one of the best measures of the intrinsic metallicity of low mass galaxies . here",
    ", we present new optical spectroscopy of leo  a and gr  8 , two extremely low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and peg dig ( faint hii regions with no detectable [ o  iii ] emission , @xcite ) . these ( and other ) observations indicate that it is often difficult to measure the gas - phase abundance of low luminosity galaxies simply because there are few bright hii regions .",
    "thus , accurate oxygen abundance measurements of multiple hii regions in leo  a and gr  8 have the potential to substantially further our understanding of chemical enrichment and mixing of enriched material in low mass galaxies .",
    "a summary of select global parameters of leo  a and gr  8 is presented in table [ tab : global ] . at a distance of only 690 kpc , leo",
    "a may be the nearest low metallicity star forming galaxy .",
    "observations of the resolved stellar population in leo  a indicate an extremely low metallicity ( @xmath7 3% of solar ) for even the youngest stars @xcite . however , accurate gas phase metallicities have been difficult to obtain for this system , in part due to the low surface brightnesses of the faint hii regions .",
    "the one exception is the bright planetary nebula ( pn ) in the northeastern quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "an oxygen abundance of @xmath7 2% of the solar value was derived from observations of this planetary nebula @xcite , but it was never certain if this value was representative of the galaxy as a whole , or just the gas ionized by the pn .",
    "we thus set out to observe several of the hii regions in leo  a in order to obtain a more representative estimate of the gas phase oxygen abundance .",
    "gr  8 is slightly more luminous and metal  rich than leo  a , but it is also an extremely low metallicity system .",
    "previous oxygen abundance measurements indicate that gr  8 has an oxygen abundance of approximately 5% of the solar value @xcite .",
    "however , an unusually high n / o ratio derived for one of the hii regions suggested that there might be regions of local nitrogen enrichment @xcite .",
    "we thus decided to observe several hii regions in gr  8 to determine if there are regions of local nitrogen enrichment in this low mass galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present spectroscopic observations of leo  a and gr  8 . in ",
    "3 we present the nebular abundance calculations and discuss direct and strong line abundance calibrations . in ",
    "4 we compare the abundance determinations of these two low luminosity galaxies to values for other galaxies in the literature . in  5 we demonstrate that even though leo  a and gr  8 are among the lowest metallicity systems known , observations of resolved stars in these galaxies indicate that star formation in these galaxies has occurred across the age of the universe .",
    "long slit optical spectra of gr  8 and leo  a were obtained with the double spectrograph on the 5 m palomar telescope on the nights of 18 and 19 february 1999 .",
    "the observations were obtained in long  slit mode ; the 2  long  slit was set to an aperture 2  wide .",
    "complete spectral coverage from 36007600   was obtained by using a 5500   dichroic to split the light to the two sides ( blue and red ) of the spectrograph .",
    "the blue side was equipped with a 600 l / mm grating ; the red side was equipped with a 300 l / mm grating .",
    "the effective spectral resolutions were well matched between the two sides , with a resolution of 5.0   ( 1.72   pix@xmath8 ) on the blue side and 7.9   ( 2.47   pix@xmath8 ) on the red side .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained by observations of arc lamps obtained before and after the galaxy observations .",
    "a hollow cathode ( fe and ar ) lamp was used to calibrate the blue spectra ; a combination of he , ne , and ar lamps were used to calibrate the red spectra .",
    "stellar and hii region coordinates were obtained from h@xmath9 images kindly provided by e. tolstoy images of leo  a were obtained on the kpno 2.1 m telescope as part of hoessel & saha s kpno 2.1 m cepheid search key program @xcite . ]",

    "h@xmath9 imaging of leo  a has previously been published by @xcite ( but their field of view did not cover the westernmost hii regions ) and @xcite .",
    "h@xmath9 imaging of gr  8 can also be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "astrometric plate solutions for these images were calculated using the coordinates of bright stars in the apm catalog @xcite , yielding positions accurate to within 1 .",
    "optimum slit positions were determined so that the slit could cross several hii regions during each observation while , at the same time , remaining close to the parallactic angle ( figure [ fig : slits ] ) . due to the faintness of the hii regions ,",
    "all observations were conducted via blind offsets from nearby stars with typical offsets on the order of 30   80 .",
    "the observations were broken into a series of 20 minute exposures ; typical observations were sets of 6 or 7 for hii regions in leo  a and sets of 2 or 3 for hii regions in gr  8 ( table [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : slits ] , in leo  a , the three slit positions include a mixture of hii region morphologies , while in gr  8 the four slit positions include all major hii regions .",
    "previous keck 10 m observations of the two compact hii regions in the northwest of leo  a and the diffuse hii region located north of slit a indicated that all of these hii regions have weak or non - detectable [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission ( h.  a.  kobulnicky , private communication ) .",
    "thus , the present observations concentrate on diffuse hii regions in leo  a , including the ring - like structure to the southwest ( slit c ) , as well as observations of the planetary nebula ( slit b ) .",
    "the hii region observations also serendipitously included one background galaxy in each field .",
    "observations of the compact hii region south of slit c of leo  a were obtained on 23 january 1999 under very cloudy conditions ; while these observations are not discussed here since the target hii region was only marginally detected ( due to the clouds ) , this slit orientation included the background spiral galaxy at 09:59:15.85 , 30:43:46.1 ( j2000 ) with z = 0.1467 @xmath0 0.0002 . finally , slit c of gr  8 included the background spiral galaxy at 12:58:39.95 , 14:14:25.7 ( j2000 ) , with z = 0.0642 @xmath0 0.0002 .",
    "the spectra were reduced and analyzed with the iraf package .",
    "spectral reduction followed standard practice including bias subtraction , scattered light corrections , and flat fielding based on both twilight and dome flats . the 2dimensional ( 2-d )",
    "images were rectified based on the arc lamp observations and the trace of stars at different positions along the slit .",
    "multiple exposures were averaged together after the transformation .",
    "the sky background was removed from the 2-d images by fitting a low order polynomial along each column of the spectra .",
    "one dimensional ( 1-d ) spectra of the hii regions were then extracted from the images .",
    "the 1-d spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction and flux calibrated based on observations of standard stars from the list of @xcite ; while the nights were not photometric , the relative line strengths should be robust .",
    "representative spectra for leo  a and gr  8 are shown in figures [ fig : leoa ] and [ fig : gr8 ] , respectively .",
    "note the excellent agreement in the continuum level in the blue and red spectra which confirms that the extraction regions were well matched on the two cameras .",
    "the hii regions in leo  a are generally low excitation , with weak [ o  iii ] lines and moderate strength [ o  ii ] lines .",
    "the one exception is the spectrum of the planetary nebula ( + 089 + 031 ) which has strong [ o  iii ] and extremely weak [ o  ii ] lines .",
    "the weak [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] lines in these spectra clearly indicate that the hii regions in leo  a have low elemental abundances .",
    "the hii regions in gr  8 show higher excitation ( [ o  iii]/[o  ii ] ) than those in leo  a ; the [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] lines are strong in all of the gr  8 hii regions .",
    "however , similar to leo  a , the weak [ nii ] and [ s  ii ] lines indicate that the hii regions in gr  8 have low elemental abundances .",
    "the emission line strengths were measured in the 1-d spectra and then corrected for underlying balmer absorption and for reddening .",
    "similar to the method described in @xcite , the strengths of the balmer emission lines were used to estimate the amount of reddening along the line of sight to each hii region using an iterative technique .",
    "the intrinsic balmer line strengths were interpolated from the tabulated values of @xcite for case b recombination , assuming n@xmath10 = 100 @xmath11 and t@xmath10 = 15000 k. assuming a value of @xmath12 , the galactic reddening law of @xcite as parameterized by @xcite was adopted to derive the reddening function normalized at h@xmath13 .",
    "for those hii regions with detected [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 , the temperature was then recalculated from the corrected line strengths and a new reddening coefficient was produced . an underlying balmer absorption with an equivalent width of 2 ",
    "was assumed in the few instances where the reddening coefficient was significantly different when derived from the observed line ratios of h@xmath9/h@xmath13 and h@xmath14/h@xmath13 .",
    "the reddening coefficients , c@xmath15 , derived for each hii region are listed in tables [ tab : leoa ] and [ tab : gr8 ] .",
    "these can be compared to the values of the foreground galactic extinction derived by @xcite of e(b - v ) @xmath2 0.021 for leo  a and 0.026 for gr  8 which correspond to c(h@xmath13 ) @xmath2 0.03 and 0.04 respectively .",
    "these very low values of foreground reddening are less than the errors on all of our reddening measurements . in several instances ,",
    "the derived reddening coefficients were slightly negative ( which is not physical ) and in these cases zero reddening was assumed .",
    "the measured intensities of emission lines for the hii regions in leo  a and gr  8 are tabulated in tables [ tab : leoa ] and [ tab : gr8 ] , respectively .",
    "the first two columns in these tables give the ionic species and rest wavelength of the transition .",
    "the third and subsequent columns list the extinction corrected line intensity relative to h@xmath13 for each detected transition .",
    "the h@xmath13 flux and equivalent width for each object are listed at the bottom of the tables ; since the nights were non - photometric , the h@xmath13 fluxes should only be taken as indicative values . the error associated with each relative line intensity",
    "was determined by taking into account the poisson noise in the line , the error associated with the sensitivity function , the contributions of the poisson noise in the continuum , read noise , sky noise , and flat fielding or flux calibration errors , the error in setting the continuum level , assumed to be at the 10% level , and the error in the reddening coefficient .",
    "note that although the spectral coverage of the red camera allows for the measurement of the [ o  ii ] @xmath167320,7330 lines , these lines were not detected in any of the spectra due to a combination of intrinsic faintness and strong telluric emission .",
    "the spectral coverage of the red camera did not extend to the [ s  iii ] @xmath169069,9523 lines .",
    "in this section we will derive absolute and relative abundances from the emission line spectra . in order to avoid confusion , we start with an overview of some nomenclature . in those cases where",
    "we have detected the temperature sensitive [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 line , we can calculate abundances following the methods described in @xcite , and , following @xcite we will refer to this as the `` direct '' method . in those cases where [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 is not observed , but [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 and [ o  ii ] @xmath13737 are observed , so - called `` empirical '' methods can be used to infer oxygen abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite has introduced the `` semi - empirical '' method , which uses the oxygen abundance and ionization parameter implied from photoionization models to infer a consistent electron temperature . that electron temperature can then be used to derive relative abundances with some degree of accuracy since the relative abundances have a much lower sensitivity to the electron temperature than the absolute abundances .",
    "direct calculation of the oxygen abundance from the observed [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission line strengths is possible if both the electron temperature ( t@xmath10 ) and electron density ( n@xmath10 ) are known .",
    "the procedure to calculate t@xmath10 and n@xmath10 is well described in @xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "a version of the fivel program of @xcite was used to compute t@xmath10 and n@xmath10 from the reddening  corrected [ o  iii ] and [ s  ii ] line ratios , respectively . in all cases ,",
    "the observed [ s  ii ] line ratios indicated that the hii regions were within the low density limit ( i(@xmath16716)/i(@xmath16731 ) @xmath17 1.35 ) .",
    "thus , an n@xmath10 of 100 @xmath11 was adopted for all hii regions . unfortunately , calculating the electron temperature proved to be more difficult since the weak [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 line was often contaminated by the nearby hg @xmath14358 night sky line . in leo",
    "a , [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 was detected in only one nebula , which is almost certainly a planetary nebula . while a hint of the [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 line is visible in several of the gr  8 hii regions ( figure [ fig : gr8 ] ) , it was only detected solidly in two .",
    "once the electron temperature of the o@xmath18 ionization zone is derived , the electron temperature of the o@xmath19 zone is estimated using the approximation given by @xcite .",
    "the emissivity coefficients for all of the detected emission lines were then calculated using the fivel code @xcite .    for all atoms other than oxygen ,",
    "the derivation of atomic abundances requires the use of ionization correction factors ( icfs ) to account for the fraction of each atomic species which is in an unobserved ionization state . to estimate the nitrogen abundance",
    ", we assume that n / o = n@xmath19/o@xmath19 @xcite , which is probably accurate to @xmath020% for o / h @xmath4 25% solar @xcite . to estimate the neon abundance",
    ", we assume that ne / o = ne@xmath18/o@xmath18 @xcite . to determine the sulfur and argon abundances",
    ", we adopt an icf from published hii region models to correct for the unobserved s@xmath20 and ar@xmath21 states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in hii regions where s@xmath22 @xmath23 was not detected , we do not calculate a sulfur abundance as the icf becomes too uncertain @xcite .",
    "the highest surface brightness feature in the h@xmath9 image of leo  a is the bright planetary nebula in the northeastern part of the galaxy .",
    "note that the h@xmath9/h@xmath13 ratio is close to the theoretical value , showing no evidence of the anomaly in the observations of @xcite .",
    "the weak [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 line is clearly detected in the high signal  to  noise spectrum of this region ( figure [ fig : leoa ] ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that [ o  ii ] @xmath13727 was not detected in this spectrum , and thus , in principle , the oxygen abundance derived from the [ o  iii ] emission ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.30 @xmath0 0.05 ) is a lower limit ( table [ tab : new ] ) .",
    "however , an upper limit on the [ o  ii ] @xmath13727 line , listed in table [ tab : leoa ] , corresponds to an o@xmath19/h abundance of less than 4% of the o@xmath18/h abundance , which is significantly smaller than the error on the total abundance .",
    "thus , we will treat this number as the best estimate of the oxygen abundance , noting that this result is similar to that derived previously for the pn @xcite in this low luminosity galaxy .",
    "note that , unfortunately , it is not possible to measure the n / o , s / o , and ar / o ratios directly in this object because the [ o  ii ] @xmath13727 was not detected and that is required for the ionization correction schemes for these elements .",
    "two of the hii regions in gr  8 have solid [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 detections . following the procedure outlined above , the oxygen , nitrogen , neon , sulfur , and argon abundances were calculated for gr  8 019019 and + 008011 .",
    "the electron temperatures derived from the [ o  iii ] line ratios are listed in table [ tab : new ] .",
    "the ionic abundances relative to hydrogen were computed using the data listed in table [ tab : gr8 ] ; if more than one line was observed for a given ion , the final ionic abundances were calculated to be the weighted averages of the values for the different lines .",
    "the nebular abundances were then calculated based on the ionic abundances and the icfs as described above .",
    "the derived 12 + log(o / h ) , log(n / o ) , log(ne / o ) , log(s / o ) , and log(ar / o ) for these hii regions are listed in table [ tab : abund ] .",
    "the mean oxygen abundance for these two hii regions is 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.65 @xmath0 0.06 , in excellent agreement with previous direct oxygen abundance measurements for gr  8 ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.48 @xmath0 0.14 ; 7.68 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as first discussed by @xcite , the oxygen abundance of an hii region can be estimated from the strong line ratio , r@xmath24 ( [ o  ii ] + [ o  iii])/h@xmath13 , since this parameter varies smoothly as a function of stellar effective temperature and oxygen abundance .",
    "furthermore , while this ratio is double valued , the degeneracy of the r@xmath25 relation can be broken by examining the relative strengths of [ n  ii ] and [ o  ii ] .",
    "if the nitrogen lines are extremely weak , as is the case for both leo  a and gr  8 ( figures [ fig : leoa ] and [ fig : gr8 ] ) , only the lower oxygen abundance branch needs to be considered .",
    "however , an additional spread in the estimated oxygen abundance for a given r@xmath25 is introduced by the geometry of the hii region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; geometric effects can be represented by the average ionization parameter ,  , the ratio of ionizing photon density to particle density .",
    "this second parameter can be traced by the ratio of the abundance of atoms in different ionization states .",
    "thus , both the sum of the oxygen lines ( r@xmath25 ) and the ratio of [ o  iii ] to [ o  ii ] need to be considered before an oxygen abundance can be determined from the strong lines .",
    "for example , the low abundance branch of the model grid @xcite generated for an imf with an upper mass limit of 60 m@xmath26 is shown in figure [ fig : r23 ] . in this model ( and other similar theoretical abundance calibrations , e.g. , kewley & dopita 2002 ) , the r@xmath25 value and [ oiii]/[oii ] ratio are used to derive an empirical estimate of the oxygen abundance .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : r23 ] , the hii regions in gr  8 cluster around an oxygen abundance of 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.8 in the @xcite calibration , indicating that all of these hii regions have a similar oxygen abundance",
    ". however , there is a troubling discrepancy between the oxygen abundances derived from the @xcite calibration and those obtained by direct calculation based on measured t@xmath27 and individual line strengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in general , the @xcite calibration appears to yield abundances that are systematically 0.1 - 0.2 dex higher than direct calculations ; this discrepancy is also found for the hii regions in gr  8 ( direct abundance calculations yield 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.65 @xmath0 0.06 , section 3.1.2 ) .",
    "an alternative empirical calibration scheme was proposed be @xcite based on hii regions where [ o iii ] @xmath14363 has been detected ( the p - method ) .",
    "the @xcite relations for 12 + log(o / h ) between 7.4 and 8.2 are shown in figure [ fig : r23 ] . in the high ionization regime (  @xmath7 0.01  0.1 ) , the shapes of the mcgaugh curves and the pilyugin relations are reasonably similar , but the pilyugin relations give oxygen abundances @xmath7 0.12 - 0.15 dex lower for the same r@xmath25 value . however , as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and is also clear from figure [ fig : r23 ] , the empirical relations of @xcite are only valid in this high ionization regime , where there were sufficient t@xmath27 measurements in the literature to enable such a calibration . in the low ionization regime , the regime of most of the hii regions in gr  8 and leo  a , the empirical relations of @xcite clearly deviate from results of photoionization models and physical intuition . indeed",
    ", @xcite demonstrate that the empirical abundances derived from the p - method have a clear systematic offset that correlates with ionization parameter .",
    "thus , the empirical oxygen abundances listed in table [ tab : abund ] for the hii regions in leo  a and gr  8 are based on the @xcite model grid , despite the inherent uncertainties and possible systematic errors .",
    "the empirical abundances of @xcite will not be discussed further .    while the gr  8 hii regions clearly outline a common locus in figure [ fig : r23 ]",
    ", the hii regions in leo  a appear to be more widely scattered in ionization parameter and , perhaps , oxygen abundance .",
    "two of the observed hii regions have extremely low ionization parameters ( leo  a + 069018 and + 112020 ) ; both are extremely diffuse hii regions located in the eastern half of the galaxy . for",
    "+ 069018 , [ o  iii ] @xmath15007 is barely detected , indicating that this hii region has an extremely low ionization parameter .",
    "similar low excitation spectra were seen in the faint hii region of another local group galaxy , peg dig @xcite . for peg dig ,",
    "the morphology ( compact ) and spectrum of the hii region is consistent with an ionizing flux of a single b0 star . in leo",
    "a , the balmer line flux that is observed corresponds to ionization by b0 - o9.5 zams stars for each of the 4 hii regions .",
    "it is thus possible that the imf is truncated ( or incompletely sampled ) or that these hii regions are evolved ( aged ) .",
    "however , unlike peg dig , the low excitation hii regions in leo  a are diffuse , amorphous structures ; thus , it is also possible that the long slit observations do not sample fully the different ionization zones of these hii regions .",
    "in particular , if the observations are missing a significant fraction of the o@xmath18 ionization zone , these hii regions may be displaced significantly in figure [ fig : r23 ] ; with additional [ o  iii ] , their location would shift significantly upwards and slightly to the right , possibly moving them into the same metallicity regime as the other two hii regions .    nonetheless ,",
    "since the balmer line fluxes of the hii regions in leo  a are consistent with radiation from lower mass , cooler o and b stars , we examine further the effect of aging in the abundance diagnostic diagram . in figure [ fig : grid ] we place the low metallicity models ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.33 ) of @xcite in the diagnostic grid of figure [ fig : r23 ] . as can be seen in figure [ fig : grid ] , aging of hii regions can introduce significant scatter in the abundance diagnostic diagram as both the ionization parameter and shape of the ionizing spectrum evolve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus , once one allows for a large range of ionizing spectra and ionization parameter , hii regions of a single oxygen abundance can populate a large range of positions in this diagnostic diagram .",
    "this is further emphasized in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : grid ] where the positions of theoretical hii regions with the same oxygen abundance as the models in the upper part of the figure are shown with varying values of the electron temperature and ionic fraction .    while the results of figure [ fig : grid ] may appear to suggest that strong line ratios alone are not adequate to determine an empirical oxygen abundance , it is important to recall that the empirical scheme of @xcite ( and others ) relies on a limited range of radiation field and a tight coupling between electron temperature and ionic fraction . since both the spectrum of the ionizing radiation and the ionization parameter affect the ionic fraction ,",
    "if the ionizing radiation is not held fixed ( e.g. , zero - age main sequence stars with a fully populated imf ) then there is a larger scatter for a given abundance .",
    "however , these parameters are likely a reasonable approximation for most high surface brightness hii regions , and thus the photo - ionization models do yield reasonable estimates of the oxygen abundance in most instances .",
    "rather , the issue of varying the ionizing radiation only becomes significant for low excitation hii regions .",
    "in fact , the tight correspondance between the iso - metallicity contours and the location of the hii regions in gr  8 in figure [ fig : r23 ] suggests that log(o32 ) @xmath28 @xmath30.4 could serve as a guideline for a lower limit of the utility of the r23 calibration .    in any event",
    ", whether the hii regions in leo  a are evolved , were formed with a truncated imf , or were incompletely sampled by the observations , it is likely that the model grid shown in figure [ fig : r23 ] is not optimal for their analysis and interpretation .",
    "thus , we caution that it is premature to speculate on possible oxygen abundance variations in leo  a ; in particular , the planetary nebula has an oxygen abundance similar to the estimated abundances of the other two ( higher excitation ) hii regions ( 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath7 7.46 ) .",
    "in fact , while we can not rule out oxygen abundance variations , all of the hii region spectra in leo  a are consistent with the oxygen abundance determined in the bright planetary nebula ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "the [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 line was not detected in any of the other leo  a hii region spectra .",
    "thus we adopt a `` typical '' electron temperature of 15000 @xmath0 2500 k to enable analysis of nitrogen , neon , sulfur , and argon abundances . while we have no representative hii regions with measured t@xmath27 in this galaxy to use as a basis for this value",
    ", there is a general anti ",
    "correlation between electron temperature and oxygen abundance because low metallicity gas is cooled less efficiently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , even with their low ionization parameters , we expect the electron temperature to be reasonably high in these hii regions . adopting this electron temperature and using the emission line strengths tabulated in table [ tab : leoa ] the oxygen , nitrogen , and argon abundances were calculated for each hii region ( table [ tab : abund ] ) .",
    "the derived mean oxygen abundance for these 4 hii regions is 7.38 @xmath0 0.06 @xmath0 0.10 where the first error is the weighted error in the mean and the second is the systematic uncertainty due to the assumed electron temperature .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with both the planetary nebula abundance ( section 3.1 ) and the low end of those derived from semi - empirical methods ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that even if the derived oxygen abundances are only rough estimates , the relative elemental abundances are less sensitive to choice of electron temperature .",
    "the mean log(n / o ) for all 4 hii regions in leo  a is 1.53 @xmath0 0.09 .",

    "the uncertainty associated with the adopted electron temperature includes the possibility that the spread of ionization parameters seen in figure [ fig : r23 ] corresponds to a spread in electron temperatures as well .",

    "finally , the mean log(ar / o ) is 2.23 @xmath0 0.08 , which is similar to the mean of @xmath4log(ar / o)@xmath17 = 2.23 @xmath0 0.07 found by @xcite .",
    "clearly , the most secure oxygen abundance measurement in leo  a is that of the planetary nebula ( @xmath29089@xmath29031 ) .",
    "however , it is not clear that the oxygen abundance measurement in the pn is representative of the oxygen abundance in the present ism .",
    "@xcite discussed the propriety of determining an ism oxygen abundance for leo  a from observations of its pn . at the time",
    ", oxygen abundances measured in pn in the lmc , smc , and ngc 6822 appeared to show good agreement with their corresponding hii regions @xcite .",
    "the addition of the present leo  a hii region abundance measurements appear to confirm those early results .",
    "however , it is possible that the agreement is coincidental . in this section ,",
    "we examine the inferred properties of the pn to determine whether it is justifiable to use the abundances from the pn to represent the ism abundance at the present epoch .",
    "we also compare the complete set of abundances of the pn to those of the leo  a and gr  8 hii regions to search for systematic offsets in o , ne , and ar abundances .",
    "there are two main concerns with using pn nebula abundances as an indicator of ism abundances .",
    "first , if the pn is from a low mass progenitor , and there has been significant chemical evolution since the formation of the original star , then the pn abundances reflect the lower abundances of a pre - enriched ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , with several pn , one can establish the history of chemical enrichment ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "secondly , the evolution of the progenitor star may have significantly altered the abundances of certain species ( typically , he , c , and n ) .",
    "if o is not significantly affected by the evolution of the progenitor star , then the pn o abundance serves as a lower limit to the ism abundance ; further , if a main sequence age can be estimated for the progenitor star , then the younger the age , the better the estimate of the ism o abundance .",
    "it is possible to estimate an age for a pn progenitor star by making estimates of its central star t@xmath30 and l. for example , @xcite have recently presented abundance measurements of a pn in the nearby low metallicity galaxy sextans b and find good agreement between the pn o abundance and two of three hii regions observed . for the pn central star",
    ", they estimate a zanstra temperature using eqn .  1 of @xcite and a total luminosity using eqn .",
    "9 of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it is then possible to use the models of @xcite to estimate a progenitor mass and corresponding main sequence age .",
    "although this requires absolute photometry and our observations were obtained in non - photometric conditions , the h@xmath9 flux reported here is in good agreement with that of @xcite . following this methodology for the leo  a pn , we derive values of t@xmath30 = 125,000 k and log ( l / l@xmath31 ) = 3.6 , resulting in a progenitor mass of @xmath7 1 m@xmath31 and thus a correspondingly very old age . at face value , the agreement between the pn o abundance and those inferred from the hii regions implies very little chemical evolution in leo  a over most of the lifetime of the universe .",
    "however , recent interest in the evolution of very low metallicity stars present in the early universe has prompted new generations of stellar evolution models at low metallicities .",
    "one of the results of these calculations is that oxygen can be enhanced in the envelopes of extremely metal poor agb stars by efficient third dredge - up @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite discovered a pn in sextans a with a 0.5 dex oxygen overabundance with respect to its hii regions . with an estimated age of @xmath71.6 gyr , this pn might be expected to have an oxygen abundance equal to or slightly lower than the surrounding ism , but that expectation is clearly ruled out .",
    "based on this observation , @xcite argue that oxygen abundances from metal poor planetary nebula should not be used as reliable ism abundance indicators .",
    "thus , we are forced to our alternative method of comparing ne , ar , and s abundances to determine if the pn abundance is representative of the present epoch ism abundance .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of [ oii ] and [ s  iii ] detection in the pn and the lack of [ ne iii ] detections in the leo  a hii regions prevents a direct comparison within the galaxy .",
    "however , if we compare the leo  a pn abundances to the average of the gr  8 hii regions , we find that the ne abundance is lower by 0.51 @xmath0 0.17 dex and the ar abundance is lower by 0.20 @xmath0 0.14 dex .",
    "these are in general agreement with the average offset in the semi - empirical oxygen abundances of 0.29 dex .    in sum",
    ", it would appear that the pn in leo  a probably has a low mass progenitor , and therefore is less than ideal for making an estimate of the present day ism oxygen abundance .",
    "it is also clearly a very low metallicity pn , and thus , subject to oxygen enrichment through stellar evolutionary processes .",
    "nonetheless , the abundances derived from the pn agree with those of the hii regions , and has the benefit of having [ o  iii ] @xmath14363 detected . while a higher s / n spectrum which detects the lower ionization species and the near - ir [ s  iii ] lines remains highly desirable , we adopt the pn abundance as representative of the ism abundance in leo  a for the remainder of this paper .",
    "both leo  a ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.30 ) and gr  8 ( 12 + log(o / h ) = 7.65 ) have extremely low oxygen abundances , on the order of 35% of the solar value ( using the old oxygen scale , * ? ? ?",

    "given the lack of shear which would lead to more efficient mixing , it would be natural to expect significant chemical inhomogeneities in the ism of these dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the motivations for this study was the anomalously",
    "high n / o ratio observed in one of the hii regions in gr  8 by @xcite . however , we find no evidence of n / o enrichment in any of the hii regions observed .",
    "further , the derived oxygen abundances appear to be uniform in both galaxies ( within the measurement errors ) , indicating that the enriched material is well mixed in both of these low mass systems .",
    "in fact , within the accuracy of the measurements , we find no evidence of abundance variations in any of the elements observed in either of the two galaxies .",
    "perusal of tables 5 and 6 indicates that excursions from the average o / h and n / o of more than 0.1 and 0.15 dex ( respectively ) seem unlikely . within errors ,",
    "all of the abundance measurements appear to be consistent with uniform abundances .    in the past",
    ", there have been insufficient hii region measurements to provide a robust test for abundance dispersions in low luminosity dwarf irregular galaxies .",

    "nonetheless , at present , it appears that significant departures from a uniform ism abundance are the exception and not the rule ( e.g. , ngc 5253 , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of significant dispersion in abundance even at these extremely low metallicities supports the picture of efficient mixing of newly synthesized elements into the hot phase of the ism before cooling back down to the observable warm phase of the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this result is remarkably similar to that presented by @xcite ; the slight difference in the zero point ( 5.67 instead of 5.60 ) can easily be attributed to the slightly different distance scales used for the compilations .",
    "similar results are also found by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : metlum ] gives the impression that the dispersion is larger for the empirically derived oxygen abundances relative to those derived via the direct method .",
    "statistically , this is correct . for the 33 galaxies with direct oxygen abundances , the dispersion about the relationship is @xmath6 @xmath2 0.17 dex , and for the 16 galaxies with empirical oxygen abundances , the dispersion is @xmath6 @xmath2 0.29 dex .",
    "however , this could be misleading .",
    "three of the galaxies in the compilation have empirical oxygen abundances based on relatively lower quality spectra ( ugca 86 , ddo 168 , ngc 5264 ) .",
    "( note that when [ o iii ] @xmath14363 is measured in a spectrum , it is , by definition , a higher quality spectrum . )",
    "when these three galaxies are removed from the empirical oxygen abundance sample , the dispersion decreases to @xmath6 @xmath2 0.19 dex  nearly identical to that of the direct abundance sample .",
    "this implies that the intrinsic scatter in the metallicity ",
    "luminosity relationship is at least of order the size of the uncertainty in the abundance measurements .",
    "given their apparent uncertanties , we delete these three galaxies from subsequent analysis of the metallicity - luminosity relationship .",
    "@xcite found an increased scatter in the metallicity ",
    "luminosity relationship at lower luminosities , with an abrupt onset at m@xmath34 @xmath2 @xmath315 .",
    "if we divide our data into a high luminosity sample ( m@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath315 ) and a low luminosity sample , for the 21 high luminosity galaxies we calculate a dispersion of @xmath6 @xmath2 0.19 dex and for the 25 low luminosity galaxies a dispersion of @xmath6 @xmath2 0.16 dex .",
    "thus , we find no evidence for an increased dispersion at lower luminosities ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is surprising , as one expects that the lower luminosity galaxies should be susceptible to larger departures in both abundance and luminosity .",
    "note that leo  a and gr  8 play a significant role in the differences between the two studies .",
    "although the abundances for these two galaxies are nearly identical in the two studies , the distance to gr  8 is now known to be roughly double and the distance to leo  a is roughly half those used by @xcite .",
    "based on spectroscopic observations of hii regions in low - metallicity blue compact galaxies , @xcite hypothesized that `` galaxies with 12 @xmath29 log ( o / h ) @xmath35 7.6 are now undergoing their first burst of star formation , and that they are therefore young , with ages not exceeding 40 myr . '' this hypothesis is based on observations of nearly constant n / o and c / o ratios for their sample of galaxies .",
    "the reasoning holds that these galaxies have not had sufficient time for the intermediate mass stars to deliver their time - delayed production of n and c. in leo  a , we have excellent evidence that 12 @xmath29 log ( o / h ) @xmath35 7.6 and the value of log(n / o ) @xmath2",
    "@xmath31.53 @xmath0 0.09 is consistent with their remarkably narrow plateau of @xmath31.60 @xmath0 0.02 .",

    "there is abundant evidence that leo  a is not a young galaxy .",
    "the hubble space telescope color - magnitude diagram presented by @xcite shows very well populated red giant branch and red clumps , indicative of intermediate and old age stars .",
    "further , @xcite discovered 8 rr lyrae stars indicative of a @xmath7 10 gyr old stellar population .",

    "however , @xcite have reanalyzed the same hubble space telescope observations , and , based on photometry which reaches roughly one magnitude deeper than that of @xcite , find evidence consistent with the detection of a red giant branch tip corresponding to a distance of 15 mpc .",
    "although not noted , the extended red supergiant branch is also not consistent with an age of less than 40 myr for all of the resolved stars .",
    "thus , it would appear that , to date , there is no evidence in support of dwarf galaxies being formed for the first time in the current epoch .",
