    "in kondo lattice metals a fermi sea of carriers interacts antiferromagnetically with a lattice of localized @xmath2 electrons , in rare earth atoms , which behave as localized magnetic moments .",
    "the interplay between magnetic interactions ( such as rkky ) and the kondo effect leads to two very different types of ground states : a magnetically ordered metal and a paramagnetic disordered heavy metal phase .",
    "on one hand , in the disordered phase the @xmath2 moments effectively decouple from the conduction band which has a small fermi sea ( fs ) made out of @xmath0 electrons per unit cell . in the heavy - fermion liquid ( hfl )",
    "phase , on the other hand , the kondo effect drives the formation of singlets between conduction and @xmath2 electrons and , therefore , leads to magnetic screening and a large fs with @xmath3 electrons @xcite .",
    "hence , on a quantum phase transition ( @xmath4 ) between a heavy - fermion and a light - fermion state the metal undergoes an abrupt change in the volume of the fs .",
    "this volume change can be observed in measurements of the hall coefficient which is a direct measure of the density of carriers in the system @xcite . nevertheless , these measurements are often complicated by extrinsic effects such as the presence of disorder and finite temperature broadening .    in the presence of disorder , either due to alloying or extrinsic impurities ,",
    "the situation becomes more complex and , due to local variations of chemical pressure , the system may break up into domains of the two phases leading to the formation of _ internal interfaces _ and to non - fermi liquid behavior generated by quantum griffiths singularities @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs close to a heavy - metal to anderson insulator transition @xcite .",
    "it has been argued recently @xcite that these interfaces control the amount of dissipation and the crossover energy scales that regulate the physical properties of disordered alloys .",
    "therefore , our studies also have implications on the study of non - fermi liquid phases @xcite .",
    "now imagine that one constructs an interface ( or junction ) between these two distinct phases .",
    "the difference in fs volume ( or fermi momentum , @xmath5 , mismatch ) leads to an impedance at the interface and hence to a contribution to the conductance in the system ( see fig .",
    "[ junction ] ) .",
    "similar experiments have been realized recently in point contact spectroscopy of normal metals and heavy fermion superconductors such as cecoin@xmath6 , with unusual behavior of the point contact conductance as a function of the applied voltage @xcite .",
    "we analyze below a inhomogeneous system in which a heavy fermion phase and a `` normal '' ( light - fermion ) metallic phase in the same material are in direct contact with each other . because the kondo singlet formation lowers the energy of the conduction electrons , some electrons migrate from the normal phase into the hfl phase , creating an electric dipole barrier between the two phases . at the interface the fermi surface volume changes abruptly , so the interface itself behaves as a scatterer .",
    "we establish the matching conditions on the electronic states and calculate the electrical conductance across the interface in a simple kondo lattice model .",
    "we also provide suggestions for experiments where two phases are made to coexist in a single sample , as in fig .",
    "[ junction ] .",
    "the total resistance is given by the sum of the bulk resistances of the phases _ plus _ the interface contribution .",
    "if the specimen is a heavy fermion material belonging to the class of quantum critical points ( qcps ) where the kondo temperature vanishes , the interface scattering should be observable .",
    "if the material belongs to the `` sdw scenario '' of qcp , the interface contribution should be absent as there is no fs volume mismatch at the qcp .",
    "therefore , such an experiment could distinguish the two types of qcps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model hamiltonian is introduced in section [ modelham ] ; section [ iii ] is devoted to the discussion of the electronic properties of the interface ; experimental suggestions are given in section [ discuss ] .",
    "top : fermi surfaces of a heavy fermi liquid ( hfl ) metal ( left ) and a `` normal '' light fermion metal ( right ) .",
    "bottom : an experimental setup where the hfl and `` normal '' metal coexist in the same sample and an electrical current flows through.,width=245 ]",
    "we consider a kondo lattice model for the metal , with a single band @xmath7 of conduction ( @xmath8 ) electrons with bloch momentum @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 , interacting antiferromagnetically with the localized @xmath2 electrons in a lattice with @xmath11 sites : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , and the spin operators at site @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 are pauli matrices ) .",
    "there is exactly one @xmath2 electron at each site . in order to describe the spin singlet formation between @xmath18 and @xmath2 electrons at every site in the hfl phase",
    ", we recast the local spin exchange interaction as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number operator for @xmath18 ( @xmath2 ) electron at site @xmath14 and @xmath21 .",
    "we decouple the @xmath22 operators by introducing an auxiliary field , @xmath23 , so the effective mean field theory becomes @xcite : @xmath24 in the hfl phase ( @xmath25 ) quasi - particles form , with momentum @xmath9 , having @xmath18 and @xmath2 components .",
    "we shall assume that only the lowest band @xmath26 of heavy quasi - particles is occupied .",
    "in the `` normal '' phase ( @xmath27 ) quasi - particles are just @xmath18 electrons .",
    "single particles are described by two - component wave - functions @xmath28 related to the @xmath18 and @xmath2 components of the electronic states , respectively , and obeying the normalization condition @xmath29 . in homogeneous heavy fermion metals",
    "we have @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and the energy of this state is @xmath32 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eband}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a normal homogeneous metal @xmath33 for a @xmath18 electron and @xmath34 for a local @xmath2 electron .",
    "the self - consistent equation for @xmath23 is : @xmath35 in mean field theory , the local chemical potential @xmath36 for the @xmath2 electrons must be chosen so as to implement single occupancy on average , @xmath37 , at every site @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , in a inhomogeneous system @xmath36 may be required to vary from site to site . in the hfl phase @xmath25 and both @xmath18 and @xmath2 electrons",
    "contribute to the fs volume .",
    "therefore , the volume of the fs must either include @xmath0 electrons in the normal metal or @xmath38 electrons in the heavy fermion metal .",
    "we now consider a system where both hfl and normal phases exist simultaneously and are separated by a thin interface .",
    "we take half of the metal ( @xmath39 ) to be in the hfl phase while the other @xmath40 half is in the normal state ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the interface is the @xmath42 plane .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath43 the bloch wave - vector in the heavy metal and by @xmath9 the wave - vector in the normal metal .",
    "if we consider that @xmath44 on the normal @xmath40 half of the metal , then the amplitude for singlet formation , @xmath45 , drops abruptly from its finite value in the heavy fermion ( @xmath39 ) metal , to zero in the normal metal @xcite .",
    "the local singlet correlation @xmath23 vanishes abruptly as one goes from the heavy to the normal metal because of the localized nature of the @xmath2 electrons . in this sense",
    ", we may say that there is no proximity effect for singlet formation . in a normal - superconductor interface",
    "there is a proximity effect for the pairing , @xmath46 , because the electrons establish the cooper pairing in the superconductor and they both propagate into the normal side transporting the correlation with them .",
    "this does not happen in the case discussed here since the @xmath2 electrons are localized .",
    "the coupling @xmath44 on the normal side effectively removes the normal metal @xmath2 local moments from the problem , so they can not establish singlet correlations with conduction electrons .",
    "nevertheless , there is a singlet correlation between a conduction electron on the normal side ( close to the interface ) and a @xmath2 moment on the heavy metal side .",
    "the same happens if , instead of taking @xmath44 , a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied to the @xmath40 portion of the metal which polarizes the @xmath2 moments , thereby preventing the formation of spin singlets .",
    "alternatively , we may consider a temperature gradient , such that the left side of the sample is below the kondo temperature , @xmath47 , and the right hand side is above @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath45 decreases continuously to zero as the temperature crosses @xmath47 .",
    "the coherence factors of the quasi - particles @xmath48 and @xmath49 vary continuously in space but the fs volume of carriers changes abruptly in a very thin region where @xmath50 .",
    "the absence of a proximity effect is rather important in the case of inhomogeneous alloys because it shows that the heavy - fermion component of the system can not penetrate the light component .",
    "the situation here is similar to the one in optics where light coming to an interface between two materials with very different index of refraction is completely reflected at the interface .",
    "the spin singlet formation between localized @xmath2 and conduction electrons lowers the effective local site energy of the @xmath18 electron .",
    "this causes the chemical potential @xmath51 of a heavy fermion system to be lower than that of a normal metal with the same conduction electron concentration @xmath0 .",
    "it implies that some conduction electrons initially flow through the interface , leaving a positive excess charge in the normal metal side and a negative excess charge on the heavy fermion side .",
    "therefore , a dipole barrier forms close to the interface .",
    "the electrostatic potential created by the barrier ( similar to that of a capacitor ) increases the local site energy of the @xmath18 electrons on the heavy fermion subsystem by an amount @xmath52 with respect to the local @xmath18 site energies in the normal subsystem ( the situation here resembles the contact potential of a dipole layer in p - n semiconductor junctions ) .",
    "the chemical potential is then constant throughout the sample but the @xmath18 site energies increase by the amount @xmath52 across the barrier from the normal to the heavy fermion side .",
    "because these are metallic systems , the dipole barrier should be efficiently screened by the conduction electrons over a length of the order of few atomic spacings @xcite .",
    "spatial variation of the @xmath18 site energies due to the formation of a dipole barrier at the interface . , width=340 ]",
    "the local site site energy of the @xmath18 electrons varies in space close to the interface , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electrostatic potential and @xmath55 is the electron charge .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath56 as @xmath57 deep inside the normal metal ( see figure [ dipole ] ) .",

    "an analytical description of the dipole barrier can be made using a thomas - fermi approximation where the fermi momenta are assumed to vary in space .",
    "on the heavy fermion side ( @xmath39 ) , using a parabolic dispersion , one can write : @xmath62\\ , , \\label{h1 } \\\\ & n_c(x)&=\\frac{2}{(2\\pi)^3}\\int_0^{p_f(x)}d^3p\\ u_p^2(x)\\ , , \\label{h2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while on the normal metal side we write : @xmath63 eliminating @xmath64 from ( [ n1])- ( [ n2 ] ) and solving for @xmath60 , we can then insert the result in ( [ poisson ] ) obtaining : @xmath65\\,,\\ ] ] for @xmath40 .",

    "the @xmath2 electrons are localized and therefore carry no charge current .",
    "it is only the @xmath18 electron that transports charge ( across the interface ) .",
    "this can also be readily seen from the microscopic conservation of the probability , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 . for a parabolic dispersion , @xmath82 ,",
    "one obtains the current for a @xmath9 state as @xmath83 , implying that only @xmath84 carries the current .",

    "@xmath85 , this would imply the continuity of the gradient of @xmath84 .",

    "one can clearly see that the larger the value of @xmath0 the larger is the effect and even for dense systems with @xmath1 electron per unit cell ( half - filling ) the value of the interface conductance is of the order of 60 % of that of a clean heavy fermion metal .",
    "in the geometry suggested in fig .  [ junction ] with the heavy - fermion , the normal fermion , and the interface in series , one would measure the total conductance of the junction , that is , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the conductance of the normal fermi liquid .",
    "hence , in order to measure the interface conductance one would have to measure the heavy and normal conductance separately , before measuring the conductance of the interface .",
    "the bulk conductance of the heavy fermion can be expressed as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is @xmath125 of the electron s transport mean - free path and @xmath126 is the size of the system ( in the clean limit , @xmath127 , we set @xmath128 in ( [ gh ] ) ) .",
    "electron scattering by impurities and phonons are included in the bulk conductances .",
    "the point we wish to emphasize is that the interface itself causes a contribution to the total resistance .",
    "the interface can be created avoiding large lattice mismatches between the two sides , so as to minimize structural scattering . here",
    "we suggest a few possibilities : ( 1 ) in the scenario of figure [ cenarios]a , a large magnetic field can be applied to one side of the sample and the longitudinal resistivity can be measured with and without the field ; ( 2 ) a sharp temperature gradient can be applied to a sample of a heavy fermion material so that half of the system is above the kondo temperature and half is below the kondo temperature .",
    "heavy fermion materials have resistivity @xmath129 above the kondo temperature @xmath47 and @xmath130 decreases rapidly as temperature is reduced below @xmath47 .",
    "if a constant temperature difference is imposed across the sample with thermal conductivity @xmath131 , a heat current @xmath132 flows . from the wiedemann - franz law",
    "we expect @xmath133 .",
    "if a material with a sharp resistivity peak near the kondo temperature is chosen , then the temperature gradient is high in the region where @xmath134 , producing a thin interface . in this case",
    ", the material must be chosen so as to minimize effects associated with thermoelectric power ; ( 3 ) in the scenario of figure [ cenarios]b , for systems where the magnetic behavior can be tuned by changing the chemical concentration ( chemical pressure ) , a sample could be grown with a large gradient concentration so that half of the system is in the magnetically ordered phase and half in the hfl phase ; ( 4 ) alternatively , two different mechanical pressures can be applied on two regions of the sample , so that the two regions are on opposite sides of a qcp , as the points a and b in figure [ cenarios]b . if the qcp occurs at vanishing kondo temperature , @xmath135 , the sharp fs volume mismatch at the interface causes the effects predicted above .",
    "a ) the kondo temperature decreases under external magnetic field and vanishes at a quantum critical point ( qcp ) ; b ) phase diagram showing the qcp between an antiferromagnetic metal ( afm ) and hfl phases , obtained by varying pressure .",
    ", width=264 ]    in systems where the kondo temperature is finite at the qcp ( @xmath136 in fig .",
    "[ cenarios](b ) ) , we believe the interface scattering between the afm and the hfl phases to be negligible small ( and would anyway disappear as a and b approach the qcp ) .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the afm , in this case , is a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) in a system where the local magnetic moments have been kondo screened by the conduction electrons .",
    "some regions of the fermi surface are gapped .",
    "now suppose that the electrons flow from the sdw to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "only the electrons in the ungapped regions of the fermi surface produce a current .",
    "an ungapped electron flows from the sdw into the paramagnetic phase without changing its bloch @xmath9 state .",
    "if an interface scattering exists at all , it should be very small , unlike the one predicted above for the kondo screening scenario , which is caused by an appreciable momentum mismatch around the whole fermi surface .",
    "therefore , we believe that an experimental setup like the one we propose can distinguish the two scenarios ( @xmath135 and @xmath136 in fig .  [ cenarios](b ) ) for the qcp in heavy fermion systems , because in the sdw scenario the interface scattering effect should be almost non - existent .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the problem of the transport through an interface between a heavy electron metal and an ordinary metal .",
    "we have argued that the heavy fermion state does not induce a proximity effect on the ordinary metal and that the hybridization gap changes abruptly across the interface . because of the change of the @xmath2 electron energy across the interface an atomically thin dipole barrier is formed , a situation quite similar to the dipole layers in semiconducting p - n junctions .",
    "we have also shown that the interface produces a contribution to the electrical conductance that depends essentially on the number of electrons in the system and that for dense systems the value of the conductance is substantial and can be easily measured experimentally .",
    "we have also proposed ways to create such interfaces .",
    "we hope this work will stimulate experimentalists to realize them experimentally .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that our results not only have implications for the problem of the nature of the heavy electron ground state , but also can be used to understand quantum criticality and the effects of inhomogeneities close to quantum critical points .",
