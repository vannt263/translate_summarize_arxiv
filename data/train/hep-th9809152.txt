    "the completely integrable models are traditionally characterized by their relation with simple lie algebras @xmath3 .",
    "this relation is the starting point of the hamiltonian reduction method exploited by olshanetsky and perelomov @xcite .",
    "these models possess as limiting cases the trigonometric ( sutherland ) and rational ( calogero ) models that are exactly soluble , i.e. their eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be derived by elementary methods .",
    "this exact solvability has been shown to follow from the fact that the schrdinger operators can , after a `` gauge transformation '' , be rewritten as a quadratic form of lie algebra operators .",
    "these lie algebra operators are represented as differential operators acting on polynomial spaces .",
    "this program was formulated in @xcite and successfully applied first to the @xmath4 series in @xcite .",
    "then it was carried over to the other sequences @xmath5 and @xmath6 and even to corresponding supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "our aim was to turn the arguments around and to develop an algorithm which may allow us to construct new exactly soluble models .",
    "first investigations were presented in @xcite .",
    "the program contains two major and separate issues , to render a second order differential operator curvature free and to find a first order differential operator satisfying an integrability constraint . in this paper",
    "we present our algorithm in the following version .",
    "we start from a standard flat laplacian and introduce coxeter ( or weyl ) group invariants as new coordinates . if the coxeter group contains a symmetric group as subgroup , these invariants are built from elementary symmetric polynomials .",
    "the second order differential operators obtained this way are curvature free by construction , and act on polynomial spaces of these coxeter invariants that form a flag .",
    "this flag is defined by means of a characteristic vector ( @xmath7-vector ) .",
    "then we solve the integrability constraints by constructing `` prepotentials '' with a fixed algorithm .",
    "these prepotentials define the gauge transformation alluded to above which renders the differential operator the form of a standard schrdinger operator of @xmath8 particles in 1-dimensional space with a potential .",
    "each prepotential contributes an additive term to this potential with a free ( real ) coupling constant .",
    "finally the prepotentials define the ground state wave function of the schrdinger operator which originates from the trivial polynomial in the flag and thus contains no further information . except a possible oscillator prepotential in the translation invariant cases , the prepotentials are in one - to - one relation with the orbits of the coxeter group .",
    "we show that all known exactly soluble models can be obtained this way ( at present we have to make an exemption with respect to @xmath9 , but this will soon be overcome ) .",
    "applying the method of constructing the coxeter invariants of @xmath10 @xcite to @xmath11 , we obtain an `` @xmath0 model '' .",
    "its coxeter diagram is that of the affine coxeter group @xmath12 , which possesses the same invariants as the coxeter group @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to an explicit proof of the equivalence of the @xmath0 model with the @xmath1 model .",
    "thus a translation invariant four  particle model after separation of the c.m .",
    "motion is shown to be equivalent with a translation non  invariant three - particle model . in this paper",
    "we also discuss @xmath2 from the view point of our algorithm .",
    "the schrdinger operator obtained ( only the rational case ) deviates slightly from the one given in @xcite ( probably due to a simple printing error in @xcite ) .",
    "thus our method shifts the centre of interest from the simple lie algebras and their homogeneous spaces to the corresponding weyl groups and by generalization to the coxeter groups . on the other hand ,",
    "the differential operators acting on polynomial spaces of coxeter invariants define lie algebras of their own , but at present these algebras are only of marginal interest .",
    "we are interested here in the bound state spectrum of schrdinger operators .",
    "the whole analysis is therefore performed in real spaces .",
    "consider a flag of polynomial spaces @xmath13 , @xmath14 @xmath15 we consider differential operators of first order @xmath16 } = z^{[\\vec{\\alpha } ] } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_a } \\label{2}\\ ] ] ( @xmath17 a multi - exponent ) + and of second order @xmath18 } = z^{[\\vec{\\alpha } ] } \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z_a \\partial z_b } \\label{3}\\ ] ] that leave each space @xmath19 invariant . if @xmath20 then the operators ( [ 2 ] ) generate the full linear ( inhomogeneous ) group of @xmath21 and the operators of second order ( [ 3 ] )",
    "can be obtained as products from the first order operators , i.e. in ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath22 and in ( [ 3 ] ) @xmath23    now we consider a candidate for a future schrdinger operator @xmath24 } d^{(2)}_{[\\vec{\\alpha};a , b ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\vec{\\beta},c } h_{[\\vec{\\beta};c ] } d^{(1)}_{[\\vec{\\beta};c ] } \\label{2.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenvectors and values of @xmath25 in @xmath26 can be calculated easily by finite linear algebra methods .",
    "let @xmath27 and the diagonal part of @xmath25 on @xmath28 be defined as @xmath29 @xmath30 if the eigenvalues of @xmath29 are all different , the number of eigenvectors equals dim@xmath28 .",
    "but if some eigenvalues coincide ( this is true in the generic case ! ) the number of eigenvectors is smaller",
    ". then the hilbert space on which the final selfadjoint schrdinger operator is acting is not an @xmath31 -space .",
    "the missing eigenfunctions can be described . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if we want completely integrable models we must make sure that a complete set of involutive differential operators exists .",
    "for this task lie algebraic methods may be very helpful .    given a differential operator ( [ 2.7 ] ) one can characterize the vector @xmath7 in ( [ 1 ] ) by inequalities @xmath32 } \\neq 0 & \\rightarrow & \\vec{p } \\vec{\\alpha } -p_a -p_b \\leq 0 \\label{2.10 } \\\\ h_{[\\vec{\\beta};c ] } \\neq 0 & \\rightarrow & \\vec{p } \\vec{\\beta } -p_c \\leq 0 \\label{2.11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there should be enough equality signs in ( [ 2.10]),([2.11 ] ) for a chosen @xmath7 so that @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out that there exists a minimal @xmath7-vector @xmath34 so that the @xmath35 spaces are maximal : for each @xmath36 there is @xmath37 so that @xmath38 it is convenient to work only with this minimal @xmath7-vector .",
    "the first step in transforming @xmath25 into a schrdinger operator is to write it symmetrically @xmath39 where @xmath40 } z^{[\\vec{\\alpha } ] } \\label{9}\\ ] ] we write @xmath41 because this is the inverse of a riemann tensor .",
    "the riemann tensor @xmath42 is assumed to be curvature free .",
    "the task to make it so will not arise in this work .",
    "but we mention that we developed a minimal algorithm to solve this issue .",
    "following the notations of @xcite we `` gauge '' the polynomial eigenfunctions @xmath43 of @xmath25 by @xmath44 so that @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "+ this is possible if and only if @xmath47 = r_a(z ) \\label{12}\\ ] ] which implies integrability constraints on the functions @xmath48 .",
    "if they are fulfilled we obtain a `` prepotential '' @xmath49 so that @xmath50    in most cases studied , we found solutions for @xmath51 as follows .",
    "let @xmath52 where @xmath53 are different real polynomials .",
    "then @xmath54 with free parameters @xmath55 solves the requirement that @xmath48 ( [ 12 ] ) belong to differential operators leaving each @xmath26 invariant .",
    "in particular @xmath56 are polynomials . inserting ( [ 15 ] ) , ( [ 16 ] ) in ( [ 14 ] ) we obtain finally    @xmath57    we will later see that in the case of the models of calogero type a term @xmath58 can be added to @xmath51 , where @xmath59 is not contained in @xmath60 as a factor .",
    "this prepotential gives rise to the oscillator potential .",
    "finally we mention that @xmath61 is the ground state wave function of the schrdinger operator , as follows from ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the expression @xcite , ( 6.17 ) for the potential @xmath62 contains a term linear in @xmath63 @xmath64 each divergence @xmath65 ought to be a constant . from now on we shall dismiss all constant terms in @xmath62 .",
    "we can then write the potential as @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 in the cases of this article @xmath69 if we then set @xmath70 we obtain @xmath71 with @xmath72 as stated in the introduction the variables @xmath73 appearing in this section are identified with coxeter invariants formed from root space coordinates @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "these invariants are either polynomial or trigonometric .",
    "finally we return from the invariant coordinates @xmath73 to the root space coordinates @xmath74 in the schrdinger operator ( [ 11 ] ) . each contribution",
    "@xmath76 admits a partial fraction decomposition due to the factorization of the prepotentials @xmath77 ( section 5 ) .",
    "the label @xmath78 is always reserved to a `` vandermonde prepotential '' , i.e. @xmath79 or alike .",
    "the laplacian for an euclidean space @xmath80 @xmath81 is translation invariant .",
    "we introduce relative coordinates by @xmath82 they separate the laplacian such that @xmath83 we use all @xmath84 as coordinates on the plane @xmath85 in order to maintain permutation symmetry .",
    "elementary symmetric polynomials of @xmath8 variables @xmath86 are defined by a generating function @xmath87 they are invariant under the symmetric group @xmath88 . for each @xmath89",
    "we have a sector ( simplex ) @xmath90 @xmath91 so that @xmath92 inside @xmath93 we can use the @xmath94 as coordinates since @xmath95 @xmath96 } v(q_1,q_2, ... q_n ) \\label{3.10}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the vandermonde determinant .",
    "the root system of @xmath98 and the corresponding weyl group possess elementary symmetric polynomials as invariants .",
    "we express the laplacian in each sector @xmath93 ( [ 3.7 ] ) intersected with the plane ( [ 3.5 ] ) in terms of these polynomials @xmath99 the dynamics will be bounded to such sectors by corresponding potential walls automatically .",
    "then ( see [ 3 ] ) it results @xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102 here it is understood that @xmath103 in this case @xmath60 is indecomposable as a polynomial , so we set @xmath104 the resulting vectors @xmath105 are @xmath106 @xmath107 and the potential is @xmath108    the corresponding sutherland models are obtained as follows .",
    "we use as coordinates a system @xmath109 defined by ( these differ from those in [ 3 ] ) @xmath110 and @xmath111 the identity @xmath112 allows us to eliminate @xmath113 and @xmath114 in terms of the remaining @xmath115 so that polynomials go into polynomials .",
    "the laplacian is expressed correspondingly as @xmath116 @xmath117   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times [ ( n - n-1 ) \\sigma_{n+1 } + ( n - n+1)\\sigma_{n-1 } ] \\label{3.25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath118 as in ( [ 3.14 ] ) .    once again @xmath60 is indecomposable , so we set @xmath119 where @xmath120 has the symmetry of the vandermonde determinant ( translations and permutations ) .",
    "the vector @xmath121 is known only up to @xmath122 .",
    "finally we obtain as potential @xmath123 in each case @xmath98 the minimal @xmath124-vector is @xmath125 .",

    "we obtain a polynomial space in the variables @xmath150 .",
