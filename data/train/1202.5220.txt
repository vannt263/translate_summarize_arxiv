    "the phase diagram of the quark matter has been actively investigated for decades  @xcite .",
    "quarks are confined inside hadrons and can not be observed as free particles at low energy . on the other hand at high energy , quarks become free particles due to the asymptotic freedom of the strong interaction . therefore , it is expected that quarks undergo the phase transition between confined and deconfined states which is one of the most important issues in the theoretical and experimental particle physics .    the fundamental theory to describe quark matter is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of strong interaction .",
    "it is , however , not practical to extract reliable predictions at low energy due to the necessity of complicated nonperturbative calculations in this area .",
    "for this reason some effective approaches are used such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite and its polyakov - loop incorporated version , the pnjl model  @xcite , the linear sigma model  @xcite , the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , the lattice qcd simulations  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we will consider the njl model known as a low - energy effective theory of qcd ( for reviews , see , @xcite ) . at low temperature , @xmath0 , and chemical potential , @xmath1 ,",
    "constituent quarks are heavy due to the chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking while they are expected to be light at high @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 where the chiral symmetry is getting restored .",
    "thus the quark system is closely related to the phenomenon of the chiral phase transition .",
    "the njl model actually predicts the chiral symmetry breaking at low energy and its restoration at high energy .",
    "many investigations of the phase diagram are based on the njl and pnjl models ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  ) .",
    "since the njl model is not renormalizable , the model predictions inevitably depend on a regularization procedure applied .",
    "the most frequently used method is probably the three - momentum cutoff regularization which introduces the cutoff scale @xmath2 .",
    "the model in the cutoff scheme may miss an important contribution when the quark density becomes comparable to the cutoff scale .",
    "there is an alternative method , the dimensional regularization ( dr ) , to avoid the issue @xcite . in the dr",
    ", divergences coming from fermion loop integrals are regularized by lowering the dimension of the integration through an analytic continuation in the dimension variable .",
    "using various regularization ways is interesting , because we believe that the regularization scheme is a dynamical part of the njl model , it is related to the size and shape of the effective quark interaction as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the model with the dr nicely describes quark systems at low energy , such characteristics as the phase structure and meson properties  @xcite .",
    "we shall study in this article the phase diagram in the three flavor njl model with the dr .",
    "it is interesting because the recent work by the present authors  @xcite indicates that the phase structure , especially the order of the transition , may differ drastically from the one in the cutoff regularization .",
