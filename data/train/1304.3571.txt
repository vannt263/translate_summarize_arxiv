    "the understanding of polymer crystallization and its theoretical description in the framework of polymer statistics remains a challenging problem since its discovery @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the classical theories of polymer crystallization @xcite-@xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite and citations therein ) are based on the nucleation theories developed for low molecular weight systems .",
    "the lamellar thickness is identified ad hoc with the critical size of nuclei , and is not related with the key features of polymers in melts and solutions . despite enormous interest in polymer crystallization over many decades , the molecular mechanism of polymer crystallization is not understood , and a polymer statistics related description is not available .",
    "a review of the research in the field of polymer crystallization in the eighties can be found in @xcite .",
    "many important specific features of polymer crystallization were established in the recent research in the field , which includes experimental work @xcite-@xcite , computer simulations @xcite-@xcite , and theoretical studies @xcite-@xcite ( and citations therein ) .",
    "the progress in the field of polymer crystallization in recent years is reviewed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a new view of polymer crystallization was developed by strobl @xcite-@xcite , who started from the observation that the nucleation based theories are in disagreement with experiments @xcite - rastogi91 .",
    "the dependence of the crystallization temperature @xmath2 on the inverse lamella thickness @xmath3 has a larger slope than that of the melting temperature , so that these curves intersect at some temperature ( comparable with the temperature of zero growth @xmath4 ) , which implies that the polymer crystallization can develop only below @xmath4 . the picture proposed by strobl",
    "is based on a multistage character of the crystallization process , and the existence of a mesomorphic layer as precursor to the crystalline phase without however specifying the statistical mechanical origin of his scenario .",
    "the aim of this article is to develop a description of polymer crystallization on a more microscopic level relying on polymer specific properties , e.g. , the coil structure of the polymers , and in terms of the relevant microscopic interactions between the monomers in the supercooled polymer melt .",
    "i develop a kinetic mechanism of chain folding in polymer crystallization which is based on the competition between the formation of stems and the random coil shape of polymer chains , and is based on the view that the driving force is due to the repulsions between fluctuational stems , which form below a characteristic temperature @xmath5 due to favored occupation of the trans states along chains , and orient in order to minimize the excluded volume .",
    "the importance of repulsive interactions in this approach is in accordance with the general evidence of the role of repulsive interactions in liquid - solid phase transformations .",
    "the dynamic interplay between forming stems and rouse dynamics considered in the present approach is expected to manifest itself as specific fluctuations prior formation of polymer crystals , and might be responsible for the mesomorphic layer postulated by strobl .",
    "the relevance of density and orientation fluctuations for polymer crystallization is not new and is the start point of the spinodal decomposition theories for the description of early stages of polymer crystallization in @xcite , @xcite . to cite @xcite `` these ( _ density and orientation _ )",
    "fluctuations are caused by an increase in the average length of rigid trans segments along the polymer backbone during the induction period '' .",
    "however , the lamellae thickness in these approaches was not brought in connection with polymer properties .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ lamella ] introduces the basic ideas of the kinetic mechanism of chain folding .",
    "section [ gr ] introduces to the calculation of the growth rate .",
    "section [ concl ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "fluctuational occupations of the trans states in an supercooled polymer melt of interpenetrating chains result in formation of stems possessing a finite lifetime .",
    "the repulsion between the neighbor stems forces them to orient parallel to each other in order to minimize the excluded volume and results in formation of bundles .",
    "the increase of average occupation of trans states below a temperature @xmath5 increases the lifetime of stems , and enforces the effect of repulsions .",
    "the orientations of stems due to their mutual repulsions is similar to the mechanism of the isotropic - nematic transition in lyotropic liquid crystals , where according to onsager @xcite the minimization of the excluded volume is responsible for the transition .",
    "the difference between liquid crystals and polymers is that in the case of polymer crystallization the stems do not exist from the beginning , but emerge due to occupation of trans states , and orient and grow due to repulsive interactions between the stems .",
    "the present approach is in accordance with simulations in @xcite-@xcite , where chain folding takes place in polymer crystallization by taking into account only repulsive intermolecular interactions .",
    "the intramolecular dihedral energies are associated with the differences between , e.g. , gauche and trans states , and are responsible for the formation of stems .",
    "the length scale of forming fluctuational stems , which are forced to orient due to mutual repulsive interactions , is determined by the competition between the growth of stems and their relaxation due to rouse dynamics . for the average formation time of stems",
    "we adopt the following phenomenological expression @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the supercooling and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants .",
    "the term in ( [ fs1 ] ) which is proportional to @xmath10 means that nonzero supercooling is necessary for stem growth .",
    "the non - zero value of @xmath8 accounts for the effect of an orienting crystal surface on the formation of stems and bundles , and is thus legitimate for secondary crystallization and in heterogeneous nucleation at small supercooling , where the crystal growth begins at seeds .",
    "( [ fs1 ] ) yields for the ratio @xmath11 the expression @xmath12 for the longitudinal growth rate of stems .",
    "a similar expression for the lateral growth rate for small supercooling is well - known in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "because stems at the time scale @xmath13 are expected to form and decompose , the quantity @xmath14 , which has the dimensionality of velocity rate , is a fluctuational quantity , so that the above estimate has to be understood as the typical value of @xmath14 .",
    "the rouse time of a polymer with arc length @xmath1 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the monomer friction coefficient ( @xmath17 for polyethylene ) , and we have replaced @xmath2 in ( [ trouse ] ) by @xmath5 ( @xmath18 for polyethylene ) , which is legitimate for small supercooling .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is the monomer diffusion coefficient .",
    "the balance between the stem growth and their spatial orientations , which is determined by the coil structure of the polymer , can be expressed as follows @xmath20 resolving ( [ ts ] ) with respect to @xmath1 we obtain the characteristic length scale determined by the interplay between the stem growth and the random coil structure of polymer chains as @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "( [ dl - ineq ] ) gives an estimate of the lower bound of the lamellar thickness .",
    "the experimental lamellar thickness is always larger than that given by eq .",
    "( dl - ineq ) , because two subsequent stems along a polymer can fold or form one stem with some probabilities ( see fig .",
    "[ coil - and - stems ] ) .",
    "other processes e.g. those responsible for lamellar thickening also result in increase of @xmath1 . resolving eq .",
    "( [ dl - ineq ] ) with respect to @xmath2 we arrive at the following relation between the crystallization temperature and the lamellar thickness @xmath23 the @xmath24 relation without replacing @xmath2 in the expression of the rouse time by @xmath5 reads @xmath25 .",
    "let us compare the orientation of stems in polymer crystallization with the isotropic - nematic transition in lyotropic liquid crystals , where the transition is determined by the condition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the density of rods , @xmath30 their length , and @xmath31 the transverse size ) are the decrease of orientation entropy and the increase of the translational entropy , respectively . because the forming stems in the polymer melt overlap , the above onsager condition is fulfilled and the stems can directly orient due to repulsive interactions .",
    "the van der waals interactions will be enhanced in bundles and contribute to their stabilization .",
    "the present kinetic mechanism of folding favors the switchboard fold surface , which is the consequence of the coil structure of polymers .",
    "the formation of stems and lamellae can be visually interpreted as space segregation of the trans and gauche states .",
    "it is intuitively expected that the repulsive forces promote a local disentanglement of interpenetrated chains , while the attractive van der waals interactions favor an amorphous state , and are therefore expected to be only important for stabilization of the bundles and consequently of the lamellar structure .",
    "the van der waals forces between polymer pieces outside the bundles and with the fold surface would result in their adsorption on the latter . therefore , we expect that the ( logarithmic ) thickening of bundles and lamellae is also caused by repulsive interactions .",
    "the enthalpic contributions to the processes of polymer crystallization are due to i ) the energy difference between trans - and gauche states , and ii ) the difference of the contribution of van der waals forces in the amorphous and the lamellar crystalline states .",
    "the condition @xmath32 is a consequence of the assumption @xmath33 in the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ fs1 ] ) .",
    "the van der waals attraction of formed stems to the surface is expected also to contribute to the non - zero value of @xmath8 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath34 for @xmath35 nm yields for example for polyethylene the value of order of @xmath36 . setting @xmath13 given by eq .",
    "( [ fs1 ] ) equal to @xmath34 expresses the interplay between the isotropic - nematic ordering of emerging stems and the coil structure of polymers .",
    "the qualitative picture is that that the stems grow until the parts of a chain outside a bundle , which are also forced to form stems , will be located on the lateral side of the bundle , and will likely belong to the same bundle ( see figure [ coil - and - stems ] ) .",
    "thus , the competition between the growth and orientation of stems and the coil structure of the polymer chains yields that the consecutive stems along the polymer fold and belong to the same bundle .",
    "therefore , the longitudinal growth of the bundles is restricted by the coil structure of polymers , which applies in the rouse theory on all scales .",
    "the slower ( logarithmic ) thickening of bundles can further occur . at larger supercooling",
    ", a smaller stem length will be selected as a result of this interplay .",
    "the kinetic mechanism of chain folding suggests that the lamellar thickness @xmath1 follows the change of supercooling .",
    "the latter is in accordance with observations made long ago @xcite .",
    "the chains in polymer melts are gaussian coils irrespective of the presence of entanglements , so that according to the above picture we expect that entanglements weakly influence the condition ( [ ts ] ) .",
    "however , the influence of entanglements on the growth rate is more complex ( see @xcite , vol ii , sect . 9.14 and @xcite ) .",
    "the proposed folding mechanism is expected to apply for both primary and secondary crystallization processes . for primary crystallization , where the surface effect is marginal ( @xmath37 ) , one can apply ( [ t - dl1 ] ) with @xmath38 .",
    "we expect that the above folding mechanism applies for crystallization from polymer solution too , where the slow collapse due to van der waals interactions occurs first , which is followed by the fast folding mechanism due to repulsion - orientation coupling after the repulsive interactions become significant as a result of increase of density .",
    "we also expect that the above folding mechanism based on trans and gauche conformation states is generic for polymers with more complicated local conformation states .",
    "( [ ts ] ) implies that the folding length @xmath1 is selected in the fluctuational regime associated with the ( ` microscopic ' ) time @xmath39 . because the ansatz given by eq .",
    "( [ ts ] ) is local , the lamellar thickness is expected , in contrast to the growth rate , to be robust with respect to changes of external parameters such as molecular weight , etc .",
    "this consequence of the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ ts ] ) is in accordance with experiments @xcite .",
    "the lamella thickness @xmath1 lies for melts or solutions in the range between @xmath40 nm , and shows a weak dependence on the moderate increase of pressure wunderlich63 , whereas the melting temperature significantly increases under pressure .",
    "the influence of external pressure on polymer crystallization shows wunderlich64 , @xcite , vol.ii , fig .",
    "12.8 ( spherulites ) that the melting temperature increases with pressure .",
    "the lamellar thickness increases smoothly for moderate pressures @xcite . at large pressures",
    "the lamellar thickness increases considerably and can achieve a few microns , and approaches that of an extended crystal @xcite .",
    "a hexagonal phase was observed for large pressure @xcite , which has at the coexistence curve a lower density than the orthorhombic phase @xcite , p. 171 .",
    "these observations emphasize the importance of the repulsive interactions in polymer crystallization .",
    "this is similar to the van der waals gas where the increase of the pressure shifts the interplay between the repulsive and attractive interactions in favor of the former .",
    "the responsibility of the repulsive interactions for stability of the hexagonal phase in polymer crystals is similar to the formation of the triangular lattice of flux lines in type ii superconductors , which has its origin in repulsive interactions between the flux lines @xcite .",
    "the repulsive interactions in the spatially ordered stems in the lamellae facilitates the sliding diffusion , which is expected to be responsible for the increase of lamellae thickness at large pressures @xcite .",
    "thus , the increase of the lamellar thickness , the development of the hexagonal phase at high pressures are direct evidences of the importance of repulsive interactions for stem formation in polymer crystallization .",
    "since @xmath41 and because of fact that crystallization can occur for @xmath42 , the crystallization line , which is described by eq .",
    "( t - dl1 ) , has to cross the melting line , which is given by the gibbs - thomson relation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the heat of fusion and @xmath45 is the surface tension of the fold surface .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ t - dl1 ] ) with @xmath32 is in accordance with strobl s analysis of experimental data .",
    "the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ t - dl1 ] ) can be estimated from the fit to the crystallization line using the experimental data from @xcite , which is shown in figure [ t - dl - fit ] .",
    "-caprolactone ) from @xcite . dashes : our fit of the crystallization line . filled circles and the continuous line : the melting line . ]",
    "the ratio @xmath46 is equal to @xmath47 and possesses for poly(@xmath48-caprolactone ) according to fig .",
    "[ t - dl - fit ] the value @xmath49 k. the slope of ( [ t - dl1 ] ) , which is obtained as @xmath50 , possesses according to [ t - dl - fit ] the value @xmath51 k nm .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ t - dl1 ] ) with constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 estimated for poly(@xmath48-caprolactone ) as @xmath54 and @xmath55 coincides with the crystallization line in fig .",
    "[ t - dl - fit ] ( fig .  10 in @xcite , and fig .",
    "11 in heck - strobl - njp99 ) .",
    "it is likely that uncertainties of the experimental data are responsible for not too excellent fit in fig .",
    "[ t - dl - fit ] .",
    "we now will consider the time evolution of formation and deposition of stems in the vicinity of the crystallization front .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of the mutual correlations of different stems enables one to consider a time - dependent growth rate of one stem @xmath56 . at the time @xmath57 , when , on average , one stem attaches to the crystal surface , the quantity @xmath58 is the growth velocity given by the ratio of one attached stem per time @xmath59 .",
    "the multistage character of the growth means that the growth occurs by sequences of processes , and implies that @xmath60 depends on @xmath56 , which enables one to write down the following phenomenological differential master - type equation for @xmath56 as function of time @xmath61 where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 in the following ) and @xmath64 is a constant .",
    "the factor @xmath65 in ( [ g1 ] ) takes into account the slow - down of the variation of @xmath66 with time , which is expected to be due to the random character of the attachment process .",
    "the absence of a positive term on the right - hand side of ( [ g1 ] ) ensures that eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) does not possess a steady state solution .",
    "note that master - type equations for crystal growth ( see e.g. @xcite ) describe many stems growth , and do possess a steady state solution .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) is similar to the multiplicative renormalization of quantities from microscopic to macroscopic scales in the theory of critical phenomena in the case when the coupling constant does not renormalize @xcite .",
    "because eq .  ( [ g1 ] ) is intended to describe the growth rate of one stem it should be integrated from @xmath67 until the time @xmath57 , which corresponds to formation and attachment time of one stem to the crystalline front .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) from @xmath67 until the time @xmath57 yields @xmath68 for comparison , the growth rate for ballistic deposition is independent of @xmath69 , while @xmath66 for diffusion controlled deposition is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "the above equation suggests that @xmath59 is infinite at the onset of crystallization , where the growth rate is zero i.e. @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "note that in contrast to ( [ g1a ] ) with @xmath73 the expression for the longitudinal growth rate , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ fs1 ] ) , is given by @xmath74 .",
    "a naive identification of @xmath59 with the time given by the condition ( ts ) yields @xmath75 however , as consequence of the intersection of the crystallization and melting lines given by eqs .",
    "( [ t - dl1]-[gt ] ) shown in fig .",
    "t - dl - fit the growth rate is non - zero only below the intersection temperature @xmath76 .",
    "the latter is also in accordance with strobl s analysis of experimental data @xcite , where the growth rate becomes zero at the temperature @xmath77 .",
    "thus , to take this circumstance into account we adopt ( [ ts1 ] ) with @xmath78 replaced by @xmath79 which yields the time @xmath80 , which is larger than @xmath59 .",
    "the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath80 can be understood as follows : while @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) gives the selection rule for lamella thickness from the comparison of time scales of competing processes ( i ) stem formation and ( ii ) coil shape of polymers , and does not make a statement on the time course of the growth process , the time @xmath80 is associated with the real time of formation and attachment of a stem at the crystal surface by taking into account the complicated dynamics , and is therefore much larger than @xmath83 . note that the orientation time of stems is not included in @xmath59 , but in @xmath84 . inserting @xmath85 for @xmath59 in ( [ g1a ] ) we arrive at the following estimate of the growth rate @xmath86 where @xmath87 is introduced to take into account the increase of the relaxation time ( viscosity ) with decrease of temperature .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ g3 ] ) that @xmath66 possesses a pronounced maximum as a function of @xmath88 .",
    "note that in contrast to the turnbull - fisher expression @xcite for @xmath89 in nucleation theory , the above expression describes the attachment rate of one stem .",
    "to obtain the experimentally measured growth rate one should multiply ( [ g3 ] ) with the average number of stems formed per time and per volume .",
    "the quantity @xmath90 is equal to the characteristic temperature @xmath91 appearing in the growth rate @xmath92 given by eq .",
    "( 6 ) in @xcite .",
    "the fit for poly(@xmath48-caprolactone ) yields @xmath93 , so that one obtains @xmath94 .",
    "note that the existence of two separated time scales @xmath39 and @xmath85 , which have a clear physical meaning in the present approach , is in accordance with the experimental finding that the growth rate depends exponentially on @xmath85 and @xmath64 , which is expected to depend considerably on external parameters such as pressure , molecular weight , entanglements , etc .",
    "@xcite , while the lamellar thickness is determined by the ` microscopic ' time @xmath39 , which , as it follows from the definition , is less sensitive to the external parameters .",
    "to summarize , i developed a kinetic mechanism for polymer folding in polymer crystallization , which is based on the competition between the stem formation , which is the consequence of preferential occupations of trans states in the supercooled polymer melt , their orientation to minimize the excluded volume , and the coil shape of polymer chains .",
    "in contrast to the phenomenological nucleation based theories , where the size of critical nucleus is identified ad hoc with the lamellar thickness , our approach has the aim to understand the basic features of polymer crystallization in terms of microscopic interactions between the monomers in supercooled polymer melts , and the coil structure of polymers .",
    "the present approach suggests that the selection of lamella thickness in polymer crystallization is of kinetic origin , and is determined by the ` microscopic ' time scale @xmath39 .",
    "the ( logarithmic ) lamellar thickening as well as the increase of the lamellar thickness with pressure substantiate the importance of the repulsive interactions in polymer crystallization .",
    "the dynamic interplay between forming stems and rouse dynamics considered in the present approach is expected to manifest itself as an ordered precursor prior formation of polymer crystals , and might be responsible for the mesomorphic layer postulated by strobl .",
    "note that the present kinetic mechanism of chain folding is in accordance with results of very recent molecular dynamics simulation @xcite on the time sequence of basic processes in formation of the crystalline order : `` first the chain segments align , then they straighten , and finally the cluster become denser and local positional and orientational order are established '' .",
    "further , the finding in @xcite that entanglements do not affect the nucleation but the growth process is also in accordance with the main conclusion of the present work that there are well separated time scales responsible for selection of the lamellar thickness and formation and attachment of stems i.e. the crystal growth .",
    "the growth rate for formation and deposition of one stem at the growing surface is derived from the differential master - type equation for the scale dependent attachment rate of one stem , which incorporates the multistage character of the secondary crystallization .",
    "the implementation of the picture of polymer folding in polymer crystallization proposed in this article in coarse grained analytic and numeric models will allow more quantitative predictions on polymer crystallization .",
