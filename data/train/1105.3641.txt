    "the theory of bounded subnormal operators was originated by p. halmos in @xcite .",
    "nowadays , its foundations are well - developed ( see @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent survey article on this subject ) .",
    "the theory of unbounded symmetric operators had been established much earlier ( see @xcite and the monograph @xcite ) . in view of naimark s theorem ,",
    "these particular operators resemble _ unbounded _ subnormal operators , i.e. , operators having normal extensions in ( possibly larger ) hilbert spaces .",
    "the first general results on unbounded subnormal operators appeared in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a systematic study of this class of operators was undertaken in the trilogy @xcite .",
    "the theory of unbounded subnormal operators has intimate connections with other branches of mathematics and quantum physics ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it has been developed in two main directions , the first is purely theoretical ( cf.@xcite ) , the other is related to special classes of operators ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we will focus our attention mostly on the class of weighted shifts on directed trees .",
    "the notion of a weighted shift on a directed tree generalizes that of a weighted shift on the @xmath0 space , the classical object of operator theory ( see e.g. , the monograph @xcite on the unilateral shift operator , @xcite for a survey article on bounded unilateral and bilateral weighted shifts , and @xcite for basic facts on unbounded ones ) . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have studied some fundamental properties of weighted shifts on directed trees .",
    "although considerable progress has been made in this field , a number of fundamental questions have not been answered .",
    "our aim in this paper is to continue investigations along these lines with special emphasis put on the issue of subnormality of unbounded operators , the case which is essentially more complicated and not an easy extension of the bounded one .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the fact that the celebrated lambert characterization of subnormality of bounded operators ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is no longer valid for unbounded ones ( see section [ subs1 ] ; see also @xcite for a surprising counterexample ) .",
    "a new criterion ( read :  sufficient condition ) for subnormality of unbounded operators has been invented recently in @xcite . by using it",
    ", we will show that subnormality is preserved by the operation of taking a certain limit ( see theorem [ tw1 ] ) .",
    "this enables us to perform the approximation procedure relevant to unbounded weighted shifts on directed trees .",
    "what we get is theorem [ main ] , which is the main result of this paper .",
    "it provides a criterion for subnormality of unbounded weighted shifts on directed trees written in terms of consistent systems of measures ( which is new even in the case of bounded operators ) . roughly speaking , for bounded and some unbounded operators having dense set of @xmath1-vectors , the assumption that @xmath1-vectors generates stieltjes moment sequences implies subnormality . as discussed in section [ subs1 ] , there are unbounded operators for which this is not true ( the reverse implication is always true , cf .",
    "proposition [ necess - gen ] ) .",
    "it is a surprising fact that there are non - hyponormal operators having dense set of @xmath1-vectors generating stieltjes moment sequences .",
    "these are carefully constructed weighted shifts on a leafless directed tree with one branching vertex ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "the same operators do not satisfy the consistency condition @xmath2 of lemma [ charsub2 ] and none of them has consistent system of measures .    under some additional assumption ,",
    "the criterion for subnormality formulated in theorem [ main ] becomes a full characterization ( cf .",
    "corollary [ necessdet2 ] ) .",
    "this is the case in the presence of quasi - analytic vectors ( cf .",
    "theorem [ main-0 ] ) , which is the first result of this kind ( see section [ cfs ] for more comments ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our method of proving theorem [ main ] depends essentially on the passage through weighted shifts that may have zero weights .",
    "the assumption that all basic vectors coming from vertices of the directed tree are @xmath1-vectors diminishes the class of weighted shifts to which theorem [ main ] can be applied .",
    "note that there are weighted shifts on directed trees with nonzero weights , whose squares have trivial domain ( directed trees admitting such pathological weighted shifts are the largest possible , cf .",
    "unfortunately , the known criteria for subnormality that can be applied to such operators seems to be useless ( see section [ cfsub ] for more comments ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , in most cases , a normal extension of a nonzero subnormal weighted shift on a directed tree @xmath3 with nonzero weights could not be modelled as a weighted shift on a directed tree @xmath4 ( no relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is required ) ; the only exceptional cases are those in which the directed tree @xmath3 is isomorphic either to @xmath6 or to @xmath7 .",
    "though our theorem [ main ] provides only sufficient conditions for subnormality of weighted shifts on directed trees , in the case of classical weighted shifts it gives the full characterization ( cf.section [ cws ] ) .",
