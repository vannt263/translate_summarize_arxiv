    "most , if not all , observations are consistent with the cosmic concordance model , according to which one - fourth of the present mass - energy of the universe is clustered and dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the remaining three - quarters is uniform and dominated by a fluid with negative pressure ( dark energy , or @xmath0 ) .",
    "while the standard @xmath0cdm model seems capable of accounting for the observations , 95% of the mass - energy of the present universe is unknown .",
    "this is either a feature , and we are presented with the opportunity of discovering the nature of dark matter and dark energy , or it is a bug , and nature might be different than described by the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "regardless , until such time as dark matter and dark energy are completely understood , it is useful to look for alternative cosmological models that fit the data .",
    "one non - standard possibility is that there are large effects on the _ observed _ expansion rate ( and hence on other observables ) due to the back - reaction of inhomogeneities in the universe ( see , _",
    "ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the basic idea is that all evidence for dark energy comes from the observational determinations of the expansion history of the universe .",
    "anything that affects the observed expansion history of the universe alters the determination of the parameters of dark energy ; in the extreme it may remove the need for dark energy .",
    "the `` safe '' consequence of the success of the concordance model is that the isotropic and homogeneous @xmath0cdm model is a good _ phenomenological _ fit to the real inhomogeneous universe . and",
    "this is , in some sense , a verification of the cosmological principle : the inhomogeneous universe can be described by means of an isotropic and homogeneous solution . however , this does not imply that a primary source of dark energy exists , but only that it exists as far as the phenomenological fit is concerned .",
    "for example , it is not straightforward that the universe is accelerating .",
    "if dark energy does not exist at a fundamental level , its presence in the concordance model would tell us that the pure - matter inhomogeneous model has been renormalized , from the phenomenological point of view ( luminosity - distance and redshift of photons ) , into a homogeneous @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the issue is the observational significance of the back - reaction of inhomogeneities .",
    "our point of view is tied to our past light cone : we focus on the effects of large - scale nonlinear inhomogeneities on observables such as the luminosity - distance ",
    "redshift relation .",
    "we will not discuss averaged domain dynamics , even though if we think it is a crucial step in understanding how general relativity effectively works in a lumpy universe @xcite .    following this approach , we built in ref .",
    "@xcite a particular swiss - cheese model , where the cheese consists of a spatially flat , matter only friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) solution and the holes are constructed out of a lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) solution of einstein s equations .",
    "we attempted to find a model that was solvable and `` realistic '' ( even if still toy ) , rather than finding a model with interesting volume - averaged dynamics .",
    "the model , however , will turn out to be useful to investigate light - cone averages .",
    "it has been indeed shown that the ltb solution can be used to fit the observed @xmath4 without the need of dark energy ( for example , see ref.@xcite ) . to achieve this result ,",
    "however , it is necessary to place the observer at the center of a rather large - scale underdensity . to overcome this fine - tuning problem we built a swiss - cheese model with the observer in the cheese looking through a series of holes .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied this model in detail and discussed the effects of large - scale nonlinear inhomogeneities on observables such as the luminosity - distance  redshift relation .",
    "we found that inhomogeneities are able ( at least partly ) to mimic the effects of dark energy .    in this paper we will analyze the same swiss - cheese model through the fitting scheme developed by ellis and stoeger @xcite in order to better understand how inhomogeneities renormalize the ( matter only ) swiss - cheese model allowing us to avoid a physical dark - energy component .",
    "we think that this model fits well in that context and therefore we might be able to shed some light on the important topics discussed there .",

    ", we can express the line element in the form @xmath30    in the cheese , the friedmann equation and its solution are @xmath31 where the scale factor is normalized so that at the beginning of the ltb evolution it is @xmath32 .",

    "the model is based on the assumptions that the system is spherically symmetric with purely radial motion and the motion is geodesic without shell crossing ( otherwise we could not neglect the pressure ) .",

    "( of course in the frw model @xmath38 . )",

    "there are therefore three arbitrary functions : @xmath48 , @xmath6 and @xmath44 .",
    "their values for the particular ltb model we study are specified in the following subsection .",
    "first of all , for simplicity we choose @xmath49 ; _ i.e. , _ we specify the initial conditions for each shell at the same moment of time .",
    "we now choose @xmath48 and @xmath6 in order to match the flat frw model at the boundary of the hole : _",
    "i.e. , _ at the boundary of the hole @xmath50 has to match the frw density and @xmath6 has to go to unity .",
    "a physical picture is that , given a frw sphere , all the matter in the inner region is pushed to the border of the sphere while the quantity of matter inside the sphere does not change . with the density chosen in this way , an observer outside the hole will not feel the presence of the hole as far as _ local _ physics is concerned ( this does not apply to global quantities , such as the luminosity - distance ",
    "redshift relation ) . in",
    "this way we can imagine putting in the cheese as many holes as we want , even with different sizes and density profiles , and still have an exact solution of the einstein equations ( as long as there is no superposition among the holes and the correct matching is achieved ) .",
    "so the cheese is evolving as an frw universe while the holes evolve differently .",
    "this idea was first proposed by einstein and straus @xcite .    as anticipated in the introduction we are building in this way a model exactly solvable and `` realistic '' ( even if still toy ) at the price of not having any interesting volume - averaged dynamics .",
    "the volume evolution of this swiss - cheese model is indeed unaffected by the inhomogeneities .",

    "note that this is not a very big bubble .",
    "but it is an almost empty region : in the interior the matter density is roughly @xmath61 times smaller than in the cheese .",
    "our model consists of a sequence of five holes with the observer looking through them .",
    "the idea , however , is that the universe is completely filled with these holes , which form a sort of lattice . in this way",
    "an observer in the cheese will see an isotropic cmb along the two directions of sight shown in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] .        to have a realistic evolution , we demand that there are no initial peculiar velocities at time @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. , _ that the initial expansion @xmath25 is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "this implies @xmath62 the function @xmath56 chosen in this way is shown in fig .",

    "as one can see , @xmath55 is very nearly constant in the empty region inside the hole .",
    "this is another way to see the reason for our choice of the curvature function : we want to have in the center an empty bubble dominated by negative curvature .       with respect to @xmath23 , the peculiar velocities @xmath65 with respect to @xmath23 , and the density profiles @xmath66 with respect to @xmath67 , for the curved case at times @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "[ curved ] it is clear that outside the hole , _",
    "i.e. , _ for @xmath77 , @xmath5 evolves as a frw solution , @xmath78 .",
    "the inner almost empty region is expanding faster than the outer ( cheese ) region .",
    "the density ratio between the cheese and the interior region of the hole increases by a factor of @xmath79 between @xmath80 and @xmath11 .",
    "initially the density ratio was @xmath81 , but the model is not sensitive to this number since the evolution in the interior region is dominated by the curvature ( @xmath55 is much larger than the matter density ) .",
    "the evolution is realistic , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ curved ] , which shows the density profile at different times .",
    "overdense regions start contracting and become thin shells ( mimicking structures ) , while underdense regions become larger ( mimicking voids ) , and eventually occupy most of the volume .",
    "let us explain why the high density shell forms and the nature of shell crossing .",
    "because of the distribution of matter , the inner part of the hole is expanding faster than the cheese ; between these two regions there is the initial overdensity .",
    "it is because of this that there is less matter in the interior part .",
    "( remember that we matched the frw density at the end of the hole . )",
    "now we clearly see what is happening : the overdense region is squeezed by the interior and exterior regions , which act as a clamp .",
    "shell crossing eventually happens when more shells ",
    "each labeled by its own @xmath23are so squeezed that they occupy the same physical position @xmath82 , that is when @xmath83 .",
    "nothing happens to the photons other than passing through more shells at the same time : this is the meaning of the @xmath84 metric coefficient going to zero .",
    "remember that @xmath23 is only a label for the shell whose euclidean position at time @xmath7 is @xmath5 . in the plots of the energy density we have normalized @xmath5 using @xmath67 .",
    "notice also that along the voids the redshift is increasing faster : indeed @xmath85 and the voids are expanding faster.,width=12 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ zorro ] , this model does not feature substantial redshift effects : it is anyhow natural to expect a compensation , due to the spherical symmetry , between the incoming path and the outgoing path inside the same hole",
    ".    however , there is a compensation already on the scale of half a hole as it is clear from the plots .",
    "this mechanism is due to the density profile chosen , that is one whose average matches the frw density of the cheese : roughly speaking we know that @xmath86 .",
    "we chose the density profile in order to have @xmath87 , and therefore in its journey from the center to the border of the hole the photon will see a @xmath88 and therefore there will be compensation for @xmath89 .",
    "let us see this analytically .",
    "we are interested in computing a line average of the expansion along the photon path in order to track what is going on .",
    "therefore , we shall not use the complete expansion scalar : @xmath90 but , instead , only the part of it pertinent to a radial line average : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are the christoffel symbols and @xmath93 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "using @xmath94 , we obtain : @xmath95 where the approximation comes from neglecting the ( small ) curvature and the last equality holds thanks to the density profile chosen .",
    "this is exactly the result we wanted to find .",
    "however , we have performed an average at constant time and therefore we did not let the hole and its structures evolve while the photon is passing ; the evolution of structures will partially break this compensation .",
    "we have , therefore , seen that the compensation in redshift on the scale of half a hole is due to the density profile chosen .",
    "even if we relax this requirement , we will still have a compensation on the scale of the hole .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ zorro ] : inside each hole , the plot is anti - symmetric with respect to the center of the hole ( the center of symmetry ) .",
    "this is only approximate at early times when structure evolution is fast enough to change the second half of the hole with respect to the first half .",
    "this discussion sheds light on the fact that photon physics seems to be affected by the evolution of the inhomogeneities more than by the inhomogeneities themselves .",
    "we can argue that there should be perfect compensation if the hole will have a static metric such as the schwarzschild one . in the end , this is a limitation of our assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "in the five - hole model ( jagged curve ) and the @xmath0cdm solution with @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( regular curve ) are shown . in the middle",
    "is the change in the angular diameter distance , @xmath98 , compared to a @xmath0cdm model with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the top panel shows the distance modulus in various cosmological models .",
    "the jagged line is for the five - hole ltb model .",
    "the regular curves , from top to bottom , are a @xmath0cdm model with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , a @xmath0cdm model with @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the best smooth fit to the ltb model , and the eds model .",

    "[ 5incheese ] the results for the luminosity distance and angular distance .",
    "the solution is compared to the one of the @xmath0cdm model with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it has an effective @xmath101 .",
    "the distance modulus is plotted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ 5incheese ] .",
    "the solution shows an oscillating behavior that is due to the simplification of this toy model in which all the voids are inside the holes and all the structures are in thin spherical shells .",
    "for this reason a fitting curve was plotted : it is passing through the points of the photon path that are in the cheese between the holes .",
    "indeed , they are points of average behavior and represent well the coarse graining of this oscillating curve .",
    "the simplification of this model tells us also that the most interesting part of the plot is farthest from the observer , let us say at @xmath102 . in this region",
    "we can see the effect of the holes clearly : they move the curve from the eds solution to the @xmath0cdm one with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "of course , the model in not realistic enough to reach the `` concordance '' solution .    summarizing , because of our assumption of spherical symmetry , we found no significant redshift effects .",
    "the effects we found came from the angular - diameter distance which is affected by the evolution of the inhomogeneities .",
    "now that we have seen how the luminosity - distance  redshift relation is affected by inhomogeneities , we want to study the same model from the point of view of light - cone averaging to see if we can gain insights into how inhomogeneities renormalize the matter swiss - cheese model and mimic a dark - energy component .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are , broadly speaking , two distinct approaches that have been applied to understand the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the standard approach is to make the assumption of spatial homogeneity and isotropy on a large enough scale , and to assume this guarantees that that the universe is represented by a frw model .",
    "in other words , it is assumed that the dynamics of an inhomogeneous universe with density @xmath103 is identical to the dynamics of a homogeneous universe of density @xmath104 .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that it simplifies the way the real lumpy universe should be averaged .",
    "it does not really specify any type of averaging procedure necessary to make use of the frw model , and it assumes that , in any case , the dynamics is not affected by inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore , there is no information on what scales such a model is supposed to be applicable , if any .",
    "the concordance model fits very well the experimental data : the direct consequence of its success is , indeed , that the isotropic and homogeneous @xmath0cdm model is a good _ phenomenological _ fit to the real inhomogeneous universe . and",
    "this is , in some sense , a reflection of the cosmological principle of spatial homogeneity and isotropy on a large enough scale : the inhomogeneous universe can be described by means of a isotropic and homogeneous solution .",
    "however this does not imply that a primary dark energy component really exists , but only that it exists effectively as far as the phenomenological fit is concerned .",
    "for example , it is not an observational consequence that the universe is globally accelerating ( although it is usually stated as such ) .",
    "if primary dark energy does not exist , observational evidence coming from the concordance model would tell us that the pure - matter inhomogeneous model has been renormalized from the phenomenological point of view ( _ e.g. , _ the luminosity - distance and redshift of photons ) , into a homogeneous @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the other approach is to make no _ a priori _ assumption of global symmetry , and build up our universe model only on the basis of astronomical observations .",
    "the main problem with the such an approach is the practical difficulty in implementing it .",
    "an approach which is intermediate between the two outlined above is based on the fitting procedure .",
    "it asks the question about which frw model best fits our lumpy universe .",
    "this question will lead to a procedure that will allow us to understand better how to interpret the large - scale frw solution",
    ".    the best - fit procedure will be implemented along the past light cone .",
    "this is because a meaningful fitting procedure should be related directly to astronomical observations .",
    "a remark is in order here : in the previous section we did not fit the @xmath105 with an frw solution .",
    "we have simply compared the shape of the @xmath105 for the swiss - cheese model with the one of a @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we intend now to fit a phenomenological frw model to our swiss - cheese model .",
    "the frw model we have in mind is a spatially flat model with a matter component with present fraction of the energy density @xmath106 , and with a phenomenological dark - energy component with present fraction of the energy density @xmath107 .",
    "we will assume that the dark - energy component has an equation of state @xmath108 thus , the total energy density in the phenomenological model evolves as @xmath109 we will refer to this model as the _ phenomenological model _ throughout this paper .",
    "our swiss - cheese model is a lattice of holes as sketched in fig.[schizzo ] : the scale of the inhomogeneities is therefore simply the size of a hole .",
    "we are interested in understanding how the equation of state of the `` dark energy '' in the phenomenological model changes with respect to @xmath58 , and in particular , why .",
    "of course , in the limit @xmath110 , we expect to find @xmath111 , that is , the underlying eds model out of which the cheese is constructed .    the procedure developed by ref .",
    "@xcite is summarized by fig.[map ] .",
    "we refer the reader to that reference for a more thorough analysis and to ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for recent developments .",
    "we will focus now in using our swiss - cheese model as ( toy ) cosmological model .     to the frw model @xmath112 of the null cone vertex @xmath113 , the matter 4-velocity at @xmath113 , a two - sphere @xmath114 on the null cone of @xmath113 and a point @xmath115 on the 2-sphere .",
    "this establishes the correspondence @xmath116 of points on the past null cone of @xmath113 , @xmath117 , to the past null cone of @xmath118 , @xmath117 , and then compares initial data at @xmath115 and at @xmath119 . from figure 2 of @xcite.,width=13 ]      we start choosing the two observers to be compared . in the homogeneous frw model",
    "every observer is the same thanks to spatial homogeneity .",
    "we choose an observer in the cheese as the corresponding observer in our swiss - cheese model , in particular the one shown in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] .",
    "our model allows us to choose also the time of observation , which , in general , is a final product of the comparison .",
    "we now explain why .",
    "the frw model we will obtain from the fit will evolve differently from the swiss cheese : the latter evolves as an eds model , while the former will evolve as a quintessence - like model .",
    "they are really different models .",
    "they will agree only along the light cone , that is , on our observations .",
    "now , for consistency , when we make local measurements the two models have to give us the same answer : local measurements indeed can be seen as averaging measurements with a small enough scale of averaging , and the two models agree along the past light cone .    therefore , we choose the time in order that the two observers measure the same local density .",
    "this feature is already inherent in eq .",
    "( [ linda ] ) : the phenomenological model and the swiss - cheese model evolve in order to have the same local density , and therefore the same hubble parameter , at the present time .",
    "the next step is to fit the four - velocities of the observers . in the frw model",
    "we will choose a comoving observer , the only one who experiences an isotropic cmb .",
    "in the swiss - cheese model , we will choose , for the same reason , a cheese - comoving observer .",
    "again , our swiss - cheese model considerably simplifies our work .      now that the past null cones are uniquely determined , we have to choose a measure of distance to compare points along each null cone .",
    "first , let us point out that instead of the entire two - sphere along the null cone , we will examine , only a point on it .",
    "this is because of the simplified set - up of our swiss - cheese model in which the observer is observing only in two opposite directions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] .",
    "this means that we can skip the step consisting in averaging our observable quantities over the surface of constant redshift , which generally is necessary in order to be able to compare an inhomogeneous model with the frw model @xcite .",
    "coming back to the main issue of this section , we will use the observed redshift @xmath120 to compare points along the null cones . generally , the disadvantage of using it is that it does not directly represent distances along the null cone .",
    "rather , the observed value @xmath120 is related to the cosmological redshift @xmath121 by the relation : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the redshift due to the peculiar velocity of the observer @xmath124 and @xmath125 that due to the peculiar velocity of the source .",
    "the latter , in particular , is a problem because local observations can not distinguish @xmath125 from @xmath121 .",
    "however , our set up again simplifies this task .",
    "the observers chosen are , indeed , both comoving ( in the swiss - cheese model because the observer is in the cheese , and in the phenomenological model by construction ) , and therefore @xmath126 . regarding the sources , we know",
    "exactly their behavior because we have a model to work with .",
    "the sources are also comoving ; however , there are structure - formation effects that should be disentangled from the average evolution . for this reason we will perform averages between points in the cheese ( the meaning",
    "of this will be clear in the next section ) in order to smooth out these structure - formation effects .",
    "now we are ready to set up the fitting of our swiss - cheese model .",
    "ref.@xcite studied the approach based on volume averaging outlined in ref .",
    "this approach , however , is appropriate for studies concerning global dynamics , as in refs .  @xcite .",
    "as stressed previously , here we are instead interested in averages _ directly _ related to observational quantities , and we constructed our model following this idea : it is a model that is exactly solvable and `` realistic '' ( even if still toy ) at the price of no interesting volume - averaged dynamics .",
    "therefore , we will follow a slightly different approach from the ones outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite : we are going to fit averages along the light cone .",
    "this method will be intermediate between the fitting approach and the averaging approach .",
    "we will focus on the expansion scalar and the density .",

    "we anticipate that for a holes of radius @xmath154 mpc , we have @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "we see , therefore , that this swiss - cheese model could be interpreted , in the frw hypothesis , as a homogeneous model that is initially dominated by matter and subsequently by dark energy : this is what the concordance model suggests .",
    "we stress that this holds only for the light - cone averages of the density .",
    "let us first explore the basis for what we found . in fig .",
    "[ photorho ] we show the density along the light cone for both the swiss - cheese model and the eds model for the cheese .",
    "it is clear that the photon is spending more and more time in the ( large ) voids than in the ( thin ) high density structures .",
    "-axis is the same one of fig .",
    "[ shime].,width=12 ]    to better show this , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ opacity ] the constant - time , line - averaged density as a function of time .",
    "the formula used for the swiss - cheese model is @xmath157 while for the cheese , because of homogeneity we can just use @xmath158 of the eds model . as one can see , the photon is encountering less matter in the swiss - cheese model than in the eds cheese model .",
    "moreover , this becomes increasingly true with the formation of high - density regions as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ opacity ] by the evolution of the ratio of the previously calculated average density : it decreases by @xmath159 from the starting to the ending time .     and @xmath151 .",
    "in the middle is the constant - time line averaged density as a function of time for the swiss - cheese model ( lower curve ) and the cheese - eds model ( higher curve ) . at the bottom is their ratio of the last two quantities as a function of time.,width=11 ]    the calculation of eq .",
    "( [ opacityf ] ) is actually , except for some factors like the cross - section , the opacity of the swiss - cheese model .",
    "therefore , a photon propagating through the swiss - cheese model has a different average absorption history ; that is , the observer looking through the cheese will measure a different flux compared to the case with only cheese and no holes . for the moment , in order to explore the physics , let us make the approximation that during the entire evolution of the universe , the matter is transparent to photons .    from the plots just shown we can now understand the reason for the best fit values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 found in the case of holes of @xmath160 mpc .",
    "we are using a homogeneous phenomenological model , which has at the present time the density of the cheese ( see fig .",
    "[ opacity ] ) .",
    "we want to use it to fit the line - averaged density of the swiss cheese , which is lower than the ( volume ) averaged one .",
    "therefore , going backwards from the present time , the phenomenological model must keep its density low , that is , to have a small @xmath131 . at some point , however , the density has to start to increase , otherwise it will not match the line - averaged value that keeps increasing : therefore @xmath131 has to increase toward @xmath161 .",
    "it is very interesting that this simple mechanism mimics the behavior of the concordance - model equation of state .",
    "we stress that this simple mechanism works thanks to the set - up and fitting procedure we have chosen ; that is , the fact that we matched the cheese - eds solution at the border of the hole , the position of the observer , and the observer looking through the holes .",
    "moreover , we did not tune the model to achieve a best matching with the concordance model .",
    "the results shown are indeed quite natural .      in this work",
    "we are interpreting the swiss - cheese model from the point of view of light - cone averages . in ref .",

    "[ schema ] .    regarding @xmath4 , we found no important effects from a change in the redshift : the effects on @xmath105 all came from @xmath162 driven by the evolution of the inhomogeneities .",
    "regarding light - cone averages , we found no important effects with respect to the expansion : this negative result is due to the compensation in redshift discussed in sec .",
    "[ histories ] and it is the same reason why we did not find redshift effects with @xmath4 .",
    "this is the main limitation of our model and it is due ultimately to the spherical symmetry of the model as explained in sec .",
    "[ histories ] .",
    "we found important effects with respect to the density : however this is not due to the effects driving the change in @xmath162 .",
    "the latter is due to structure evolution while the former to the presence of voids , so the two causes are not directly connected .",
    "indeed , it is possible to turn off the latter and not the former .",
    "we can therefore make the point that the expansion is not affected by the inhomogeneities because of the compensation due to the spherical symmetry .",
    "the density , on the other hand , is not affected by the spherical symmetry , so there are no compensations , and the photon systematically sees more and more voids than structures .",
    "we can therefore argue that the average of the density is more relevant than the average of the expansion because it is less sensitive to the assumption of spherical symmetry , which is one of the limitations of this model .",
    "the next step is to define a hubble parameter from this average density : @xmath163 . in this way we are moving from a swiss cheese made of spherically symmetric holes to a swiss cheese without exact spherical symmetry .",
    "the correspondence is through the light - cone averaged density which , from this point of view , can be seen as a tool in performing this step .",
    "summarizing again :    * we started with a swiss - cheese model containing only spherically symmetric holes .",
    "a photon , during its journey through the swiss cheese , undergoes a redshift that is not affected by inhomogeneities .",
    "however the photon is spending more and more time in the voids than in the structures .",
    "the lack of an effect is due to spherical symmetry .",
    "we focus on this because a photon spending most of its time in voids should have a different redshift history than a photon propagating in a homogeneous background .",
    "* since the density is a quantity that is not particularly sensitive to spherical symmetry , we try to resolve the mismatch by focusing on the density alone and getting from it the expansion ( and therefore the redshift history ) .",
    "* we ended up with a swiss - cheese model with holes that effectively are not spherically symmetric . in this model",
    "there is an effect on the redshift history of a photon due to the voids . * in practice this means that we will use the phenomenological best - fit model found , that is , we will use a model that behaves similarly to the concordance model .",
    "let us go back to the discussion of sec .",

    "* the scale dependence is linear : the equation of state depends linearly on the length of holes the photon propagates through .",
    "we stress that the dependence we are talking about is not on the scale of the universe , but on the size of the holes .",
    "we can finally ask which size of the holes will give us a phenomenological model able to mimic the concordance model .",
    "we found that for @xmath178 , that is for a holes of radius @xmath154 mpc , we have @xmath179 and @xmath180 , which in terms of the energy density parametrization of eq .",

    "@xcite ) . to achieve this result , however , it is necessary to place the observer at the center of a rather large - scale underdensity . to overcome this fine - tuning problem we built a swiss - cheese model , placing the observer in the cheese and having the observer look through the holes in the swiss - cheese as pictured in fig .",
    "[ schizzo ] .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] we defined the model and described its dynamics : it is a swiss - cheese model where the cheese is made of the usual frw solution and the holes are made of a ltb solution .",
    "the voids inside the holes are expanding faster than the cheese .",
    "we reported also the results for @xmath4 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for a more thorough analysis .",
    "we found that redshift effects are suppressed because of a compensation effect due to spherical symmetry .",
    "however , we found interesting effects in the calculation of the angular distance : the evolution of the inhomogeneities bends the photon path compared to the frw case .",
    "therefore , inhomogeneities will be able ( at least partly ) to mimic the effects of dark energy .",
    "after having analyzed the model from the observational point of view , we set up in section [ fitti ] the fitting problem in order to better understand how inhomogeneities renormalize the matter swiss - cheese model allowing us to eschew a primary dark energy .",
    "we followed the scheme developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but modified in the way to fit the phenomenological model to the swiss - cheese one .",
    "we chose a method that is intermediate between the fitting approach and the averaging one : we fitted with respect to light - cone averages .",
    "in particular , we focused on the expansion and the density .",
    "while the expansion behaved as in the frw case because of the compensation effect mentioned above , we found that the density behaved differently thanks to its intensiveness to that compensation effect : a photon is spending more and more time in the ( large ) voids than in the ( thin ) high density structures .",
    "this effect is not directly linked to the one giving us an interesting @xmath162 .",

    "the insensitivity to the compensation effect made us think that a swiss cheese made of spherical symmetric holes and a swiss cheese without an exact spherical symmetry would share the same light - cone averaged density . knowing the behavior of the density we are therefore able to know the one of the hubble parameter that will be the one of the frw solution with an phenomenological source characterized by the fit equation of state . in this way",
    "we can think to go beyond the main limitation of this model , that is , the assumption of spherical symmetry . from this point of view , the light - cone averaged density can be seen as a tool in performing this step .",
