    "the chandra x - ray observatory revealed the bow - shaped discontinuities in the x - ray emitting hot plasmas in the clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the plasma temperature sharply increases across the discontinuities , while the plasma density sharply decreases across the discontinuities toward the same direction .",
    "these new structures are called cold fronts .",
    "the cold fronts might be the contacting surfaces of two different origin plasmas .",
    "if the classical spitzer heat conductivity is applied , the life time of the cold fronts should be @xmath1yr .",
    "since it is much less than the expected ages of the cold fronts , that is @xmath2yr , the heat conductivity in the cold fronts region must be significantly reduced from the classical spitzer value @xcite .",
    "since there are thermal pressure jumps across the fronts ( vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001a ) , a transonic motion of the cold fronts is expected to maintain the pressure balance between the cold and hot regions .",
    "vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2001b , 2002 ) pointed out that the magnetic field of @xmath3 g along the fronts should exist to explain the smoothness of the fronts otherwise the irregular structures are expected due to the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability . since the required field strength is more than order of magnitude stronger than the intracluster magnetic field strength while the plasma density jump is at most factor of two across the cold fronts , the compression of the intracluster magnetic field as conserving the flux can not explain the existence of such a strong magnetic field in the cold fronts .    a precise mathematical treatment of the thin hot plasmas based on the plasma kinetic theory found that the anisotropic electron velocity distribution induced by the temperature gradient drives the plasma instability , and it is postulated that the electron scattering by the excited plasma waves may significantly reduce the heat conductivity ( ramani & laval 1978 ) .",
    "the low frequency transverse growing magnetic waves are excited even in the absence of an background magnetic field .",
    "since the instability was found by ramani and laval ( 1978 ) , the instability is referred to the ramani - laval ( rl ) instability in this paper .",
    "the applications of the rl instability to the cluster hot plasmas were examined by some authors ; in cases of the plasma with background magnetic fields @xcite and the electron - ion two components plasma @xcite .",
    "although the rl instability was said to be the weibel like instability @xcite since the growth of the waves is seeded by the anisotropic velocity distribution , there are plenty of the qualitative differences among the both instabilities as explained in section 3 .",
    "therefore , the both instabilities were distinguished @xcite and it is very important to determine the physical mechanism of the rl instability .    since this paper is the first paper of our series of papers , we focus on the identification of the physical mechanism of the rl instability ( in  2 . and 4 . )",
    "including the review of the weibel instability ( in appendix ) and the rl instability ( in  3 ) , the determination of the non - linear saturation level of the excited waves and the non - linear evolution of the excited modes ( in  5 ) , and the application to the cold fronts ( in  6 . ) .",
    "section 7 is devoted to discussion .",
    "in this section , how the anisotropic electron velocity distribution function is set up when the temperature inhomogeneity exists in the plasma , is discussed from physical point of view . the absence of a background magnetic field is assumed .",
    "consider the temperature inhomogeneity in hot electron plasma with the temperature variation scale of @xmath4 .",
    "since the heat conduction carries the heat flux from the hotter to cooler regions , the heat flux along the temperature gradient takes a negative finite value ; @xmath5 where the bracket denotes the integral over the velocity space and the subscript @xmath6 denotes the component parallel to the temperature gradient .",
    "therefore , the electron velocity distribution function must deviate from the maxwell - boltzmann @xmath7 ; @xmath8 . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the electron number density , @xmath10 is the thermal velocity with the temperature @xmath11 and the electron mass @xmath12 .",
    "the above condition together with @xmath13 , that is the number density conservation , and @xmath14 , that is the energy conservation , restrict the form of the deviated part , @xmath15 , to be odd function of the velocity component along the temperature gradient , @xmath16 .",
    "of course , @xmath17 as @xmath18 . in figure 1",
    ", the possible cases as @xmath15 are shown . from zero current condition , such as @xmath19 , the form like the type a is rejected since @xmath15 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively positive and negative , and then @xmath22 for all velocity and @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "the type b and c satisfy the zero current condition since @xmath15 curve acrosses the @xmath16-axis in each positive and negative @xmath16 region .",
    "the @xmath24 for the type b and c have finite values because this is the weighted mean of @xmath25 weighted by @xmath26 which is larger when @xmath27 is larger .",
    "the heat flux condition of @xmath28 says that @xmath15 where @xmath29 should be positive .",
    "thus , the type c is only the possible form as the deviated part in the plasma where the finite heat flow exists .",
    "the relative amplitude of the deviated part to the maxwell - boltzmann should be @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the fractional temperature fluctuation , since the deviation may be induced by the coulomb collision and the temperature fluctuation .",
    "the deviated part @xmath15 can be also deduced analytically .",
    "the boltzmann equation is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the zeroth electric field along the temperature gradient and the rhs is the krook operator as the collision term and @xmath35 is the coulomb collision frequency with the coulomb mean free path @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we describe the collision frequency as @xmath37 with the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for simplicity ,",
    "the pressure balance is assumed .",

    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the form of the deviated part is essentially the same as the type c shown in figure 1 .",
    "we would like to note that adopting the krook operator is not essential for determining the form of the deviated part .",
    "the diagnostics of the ramani - laval ( rl ) instability are summarized contrasting with the weibel instability . as summarized in the appendix",
    ", the temperature anisotropy excites the transverse magnetic waves due to the weibel instability .",
    "the excited wave is standing wave with zero phase velocity .",
    "the amplitude of the wave grows when the temperature perpendicular to the wave vector is higher than the temperature parallel to the wave vector .",
    "the amplitude of the wave is damped in the opposite situation .",
    "ramani and laval ( 1978 ) studied the stability of the plasmas when the temperature distribution is not homogeneous .",
    "the non - equilibrium electron velocity distribution function is deduced from the assumed temperature distribution self consistently using the chapman - enskog expansion .",
    "this is one of the prominent difference from the weibel case where the anisotropic electron velocity distribution function due to the temperature anisotropy is given by hand .",
    "the difference of the deduced non - equilibrium velocity distribution function from the equilibrium one , that is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , is skewed in the direction of the temperature gradient and is the odd function of the velocity component along the temperature gradient .",
    "the velocity distribution functions in the both cases are anisotropic .",
    "however , the skewed nature found in the rl case is not found in the weibel .",
    "although the anisotropic velocity dispersion is essential for the weibel instability , the velocity dispersion is isotropic in the rl case .",
    "ramani and laval ( 1978 ) performed the linear stability analysis of the plasmas with the deduced non - equilibrium velocity distribution following the procedure of the plasma kinetic theory .",
    "two independent modes appear .",
    "the two modes are distinguished whether the magnetic field is in or not in the plane made by the temperature gradient and the wave vector , where the first one is named mode 2 and the second one is named mode 1 .",
    "the dispersion relation of the both modes have a real part as @xmath46 the imaginary part of the mode 1 is obtained as , @xmath47 and the imaginary part of the mode 2 is obtained as , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath50 is the speed of light and @xmath51 is the angle between the direction of the temperature gradient and the wave vector .",
    "the existence of the real part in the dispersion relation of the rl instability is one of the difference from the weibel case .",
    "since the phase velocity along the temperature gradient @xmath52 only takes a positive value , the wave propagates only one way from the low temperature region to the high temperature region .",
    "therefore , the excited waves do not carry the heat from the hot to the cold region .",
    "although the mode 2 is a pure transverse wave , the longitudinal component of the electric fields , @xmath53 , has a non - zero value for the mode 1 as @xmath54 this is an another prominent difference from the weibel case .",
    "the wave grows the most rapidly when the wave vector is parallel to the temperature gradient .",
    "the wave is damped when the direction of the wave propagation is perpendicular to the temperature gradient .",
    "the dependence on the @xmath55 of the growth rate is the same as that of the weibel .    in a sence",
    "that the anisotropic velocity distribution is the driving force of the instability , the both instabilities are similar and therefore the rl instability was said to be the weibel like .",
    "however , there are plenty of the qualitative differences among the both instabilities as explained in above",
    ". therefore , the both instabilities were distinguished @xcite and we try to identify the physical mechanism of the rl instability in the next section .",
    "the physical mechanism of the rl instability can be understood from the nature of the velocity distribution function when the finite heat flow exists , as illustrated in figure 2 . in the following discussion ,",
    "strictness of the numerical factor is ignored .",
    "the peak position is shifted toward positive @xmath56 direction and the amount of the shift is @xmath57 .",
    "the phase velocity of any low frequency magnetic transverse wave must be close to the velocity at where the distribution function has a peak value otherwise a finite net electric current is induced by the wave magnetic fields . this explains why the excited waves by the rl instability have the phase velocity of @xmath58 , and travel one way direction rising up the temperature gradient and the waves can not travel in the direction of the perpendicular to the temperature gradient .",
    "the reason why the excited waves by the weibel instability are standing wave , is simply because there is no shift in peak position of the velocity distribution function in the weibel case .",
    "the peak value is increased by @xmath59 from that of the pure maxwell - boltzmann case since the amplitude of the deviated part takes a value of @xmath60 relative to the maxwell - boltzmann and the value of the maxwell - boltzmann part is nearly same as the peak value at @xmath61 . since the total electron number density must be unchanged , for the observer comoving with the waves this can be interpreted as the decrease of the effective electron temperature in the direction of the temperature gradient , @xmath62 , by @xmath63 relative to the temperature perpendicular to the temperature gradient , @xmath64 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the growth of the magnetic waves in the rl instability is , therefore , due to essentially the same mechanism as the weibel instability @xcite in which the temperature anisotropy is the driving force of the instability . consider the waves traveling nearly parallel to the temperature gradient . in this case ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the temperature components perpendicular and parallel to the wave vector for the observers comoving with the waves , respectively .",
    "since @xmath69 , the waves can grow . as a result ,",
    "the direction of the magnetic field generated by the instability is almost perpendicular to the temperature gradient .",
    "the growth rate of the mode which travels toward the direction of the temperature gradient with wavenumber @xmath55 is obtained from that of the weibel instability @xcite , @xmath70\\nonumber\\\\ & \\sim & v_{{\\rm th}}\\left[(\\epsilon\\delta_t)^2 k -\\left({ck\\over \\omega_{{\\rm p}}}\\right)^2k\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the growth rate gets the maximum value of @xmath71 at @xmath72 . when the direction of the wave vector is perpendicular to the temperature gradient , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "since @xmath75 in this case , the wave can not grow .",
    "these results are exactly the same as the results led by the plasma kinetic theory except numerical factors @xcite .",
    "the above discussion gives a complete physical explanation for the mode 2 of the rl instability .",
    "however , these are not satisfactory to the mode 1 in which the longitudinal electric field component appears .",
    "unfortunately , we have not yet gotten the physical explanation for this .",
    "this is still an open question .",
    "the nonlinear saturation level of the excited wave is estimated assuming that the wave - particle interaction determines the saturation level .",
    "the fundamentals are illustrated in figure 3 @xcite .",
    "once the larmor radius of an electron gets shorter than the wavelength of the growing mode , the electron is trapped by the magnetic field of the wave and the magnetic flux enclosed by its orbit becomes finite .",
    "then , the kinetic energy of the trapped electron starts monotonically increase as the growth of the magnetic field strength , since the increase of the magnetic flux enclosed by the electron orbit cause the induction electric fields which accelerate the electron as the betatron accelerator . once the larmor radius of typical thermal electrons , @xmath76 , gets shorter than the wavelength of the fastest growing mode , that is @xmath77 , the increase of the kinetic energy of the electron system becomes significant if the waves still continue to grow .",
    "since this finally violates the energy conservation , the growth of the magnetic field strength must be saturated when @xmath78 .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic fields after the nonlinear saturation could be described as follows . some numerical simulations which follow the evolution of the weibel instability , showed that the strength of the magnetic field driven by the weibel instability decreases after it gets the maximum value @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "as the magnetic field grows , the electron velocity distribution is isotropitized and it becomes difficult to maintain the electric current field which supports the magnetic field of the waves .",
    "in these simulations , the system is assumed to be isolated and the initial anisotropic velocity distribution function let be free to evolve to isotropic one . on the other hand , in the case of the rl instability",
    "there is a driving force which maintains the anisotropy of the velocity distribution function . as far as the temperature gradient",
    "is not disappeared , the finite heat flux transports the heat from the hot to the cold region and the anisotropic velocity distribution function discussed in section 2 is maintained .",
    "therefore , the decrease of the magnetic field strength after the nonlinear saturation as found in the weibel instability may not be occurred in the rl instability .",
    "it is expected that the generated magnetic field strength is kept to be the saturated value for the life time of the temperature gradient .",
    "wallace and epperlein ( 1991 ) performed the numerical simulations to follow the evolution of the weibel instability when an initial anisotropic distribution function is maintained by an external source .",
    "they showed that the magnetic field strength is kept constant value after the saturation .",
    "their results support the above expectation for the rl instability .",
    "there are several indicative numerical simulations concerning the organization of the globally connected magnetic fields from the wavy fields generated by the instability .",
    "the wavy magnetic fields generated by the weibel instability evolve into the longer wavelength modes after the saturation @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that the excited wavy magnetic field automatically evolves into the globally connected fields .",
    "this could be understood as follows .",
    "after the magnetic field strength gets the saturated level , the electric current field starts to play as an individual electric beams every half wave length ( fig.4 ) .",
    "each beam is surrounded by the azimuthal magnetic field generated by the current beam itself .",
    "the electric beams interact each other via the ampre s force @xcite .",
    "the beams directed to the same direction are attracted each other and automatically gather .",
    "finally , they merge into larger one beam .",
    "since the physical mechanism of the growth of the rl instability is the same as the weibel instability as shown in section 4 , the same evolution is expected even in the rl case .",
    "although the reduction of the heat conductivity was originally considered due to the electrons scattering by the waves generated by the rl instability @xcite , this may not be the case . as discussed in above , the wavy magnetic field generated by the instability could tend to form the global magnetic field automatically .",
    "therefore , the suppression of the heat conductivity may be determined by the trapping of the electrons by the organized magnetic field . to estimate the suppression of the heat conductivity quantitatively",
    ", we have to know what is the final structure of the magnetic field due to the self - organization .",
    "the detail nonlinear studies , numerical simulations for example , are desired to answer the questions .",
    "the above results are applied to the cold front found in the cluster of galaxies a3667 .",
    "the temperature and density of the electron changes from @xmath79 and @xmath80 to @xmath81 and @xmath82 across the cold front ( vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001a ) .",
    "the width of cold front is @xmath83 at maximum .",
    "the coulomb mean free path of the thermal electron in the cold front region is @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 in the cold front of a3367 .",
    "the growth time scale of the unstable mode in the cold front is @xmath88 .",
    "although the exact time scale over which the instability can generate magnetic fields with the saturation values over the scale of the interfaces is difficult to estimate , that must be several tens times longer than the growth time scale .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the magnetic field is generated almost instantaneously compared with any other dynamical time scales in the cluster of galaxies . by applying the saturation level discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the saturated magnetic field strength in the cold front should be @xmath89 where the exact dispersion relation obtained by ramani and laval ( 1978 ) was used .",
    "the obtained value agrees surprisingly well with the speculated value of @xmath90 based on the stability consideration against the kh instability .",
    "the direction of the generated magnetic field should be almost parallel to the cold front surface due to the characteristics of the mode . as discussed in section 5",
    ", the generated wavy magnetic fields could tend to evolve into the globally connected field .",
    "therefore , we expect that the cold front surface is covered by the globally connected magnetic fields directed tangential to the surface with the strength of @xmath90 and the kh instability is suppressed by these fields . although to suppress the kh instability the existence of the magnetic fields are required only in the tail of the cold fronts @xcite , our model predicts the existence of such a strong fields all over the cold front where the temperature jump exists .",
    "the generated magnetic field may significantly reduce the electron mean free path in the direction of the temperature gradient and could suppress the heat conduction all over the cold fronts .",
    "we have successfully determined the physical mechanism responsible for one of the two independent modes of the rl instability , and shown that the growth mechanism is identical to the weibel instability which is well - known as one of the generation mechanism of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the rl instability can be also considered as the generation mechanism of the magnetic fields in the astronomical situations .",
    "the nonlinear saturation level of the instability is estimated by considering the wave - particle interaction .",
    "the evolutions of the magnetic fields after the saturation are speculated by referring the previous numerical simulations which followed the non - linear evolution of the weibel instability .",
    "the generated fields might be self - organized and evolve into the globally connected magnetic field .",
    "the results are applied to the cold front in a3667 .",
    "the existence of the magnetic field of @xmath0 g tangential to the surfaces in all over the cold front is predicted .",
    "the results surprisingly agree with the predicted nature of the magnetic field in the cold front to explain the smoothness of the cold front surface structure avoiding the kh instability .",
    "although the suppression of the kh instability requires the existence of the strong magnetic field only in the tail of the cold front , our model predicts the existence of such a strong fields all over the cold front where the temperature jump exists . the significant suppression of the heat conduction in the cold front is also expected by the trapping of the electrons by the generated magnetic fields .",
    "thus , our model predicts that the bow - shaped structure of the cold fronts should not partially disappear and the whole structure should be maintained .",
    "of course further studies on the rl instability are desired .",
    "the non - linear studies using the numerical simulations specificated to the rl instability and the cold front are one of the most important remaining subjects .",
    "the identification of the physical mechanism of the mode 1 how the longitudinal electric field is generated , is another important remained subject .",
    "the physics of the rl instability discussed in this paper should be universal and the rl instability may play an important role in various hot thin plasmas in the universe .",
    "for example , the temperature inhomogeneities of @xmath91 distributed in whole cluster has been found in almost all clusters of galaxies .",
    "the rl instability predicts the existence of the cluster halo magnetic field with strength of @xmath92 g .",
    "surprisingly the predicted value just coincides with the observationally reported cluster halo magnetic field strength .",
    "the details of this topic are reported in the force coming paper @xcite .",
    "we believe that the rl instability may provide a new fruitful possibility on the origin of the cosmic magnetic field .",
    "the authors gratefully thank t. n. kato , m. iijima , m. takizawa , h. ohno and y. fujita for their a lot of fruitful comments , and anonymous referee for one s constructive comments .",
    "the weibel instability is driven by an anisotropic temperature distribution and generates the growing transverse magnetic standing waves @xcite .",
    "this instability is well - known as the mechanism of the magnetic fields generation from zero initial magnetic field .",
    "consider the plasma with an anisotropic temperature such as @xmath93 , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath94 respectively denote the parallel and perpendicular direction to the wave vector .",
    "the dispersion relation is obtained by the linear plasma kinetic theory @xcite as @xmath95 .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the waves has no real part of the frequency .",
    "the waves grow when @xmath96 .",
    "the excited waves are transverse magnetic waves with no electric field",
    ".    the physical mechanism of the weibel instability is first identified by fried ( 1959 ) .",
    "consider the simple situations as shown in fig .",
    "the electrons and their initial velocities are expressed as the filled circles and the dotted arrows . in the case",
    "a , the simple anisotropic initial electron distribution function @xmath97 is assumed where @xmath98 is the electron number density .",
    "this represents an extreme case of @xmath99 . in the case",
    "b , the anisotropic initial electron distribution function @xmath100 is assumed .",
    "this represents an extreme case of @xmath101 .",
    "the directions of the perturbed magnetic fields are perpendicular to the paper : @xmath102 & @xmath103 represent that the fields project from the paper and rush in the paper , respectively .",
    "the size of the circle is proportional to the field strength at each position .",
    "firstly , the qualitative explanation of the physical mechanism is reviewed .",
    "the electrons orbits are deflected due to the introduction of the perturbed magnetic field as shown by the dashed arrows .",
    "the amount of the deflection is proportional to the field strengths at the each position .",
    "we first discuss the case a. consider the electrons ( a ) and ( a ) which initially have the negative velocity in the @xmath104 direction .",
    "they respectively carry the positive electric currents in the @xmath104 direction out from and into the shaded region .",
    "because of the difference of the field strengths , the net positive current in the @xmath104 direction is carried out from the region in a certain infinitesimal time interval . in other words the net negative electric current is carried into the region by the perturbed motion of these electrons .",
    "the electrons ( b ) and ( b ) also carry the net negative electric current into the shaded region .",
    "therefore , the net negative electric current is developed in the shaded region due to the injection of the perturbed magnetic field .",
    "since the values of the induced electric currents are larger where the gradient of the magnetic field strength is larger , the current fields illustrated in fig . 4 are set up where the length of the arrows are proportional to the amplitudes of the currents .",
    "the magnetic field is produced around each electric current according to the ampre s law as illustrated in fig.4 .",
    "the growth of the magnetic field is determined by the superposition of these fields .",
    "for example , at point @xmath105 the net magnetic field generated by the current fields is normal to the paper toward readers and amplifies the injected perturbed field .",
    "since the excited fields amplify the injected perturbed fields everywhere , the perturbed field grows in the case a. on the other hand , the net induced electric currents direct opposite direction to case a in the case b. therefore , the perturbed magnetic field is damped in the case b. hence , when @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) the magnetic field perturbation grows and when @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) the magnetic field perturbation is damped .",
    "while this simple explanation shows qualitatively how the growth occurs , the role of the electromagnetic induction for the growth of the instability , which was neglected in the above discussion , should be examined since it acts to reduce the growth of the magnetic field .",
    "next , the semi quantitative explanation of the instability is given to see the role of the induction .",
    "for this purpose , only the case a is considered .",
    "suppose that an initial perturbed magnetic field is @xmath110 the @xmath111 and @xmath104 components of the equation of motion of the electron are given by @xmath112 respectively , where the last term in @xmath104 component represents the force due to the inductive electric field .",
    "therefore , the time derivative of the electric current flux is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the @xmath104 component of the electric current carried by an single electron and @xmath115 is the average over the velocity space .",
    "this current flux and the inductive electric field cause a change in the mean value of @xmath116 as @xmath117 the ampre s law provides @xmath118 where the displacement current is neglected since the low frequency mode is only considered . by combining these equations ,",
    "we obtain @xmath119{\\partial^2 b_z\\over \\partial t^2 } & = & { \\omega_{p}^2\\over c^2}u^2b_z.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dispersion relation is obtained as @xmath120 it shows that the perturbation can grow .",
    "the second term in the @xmath121 $ ] of the left hand side is coming from the induction term .",
    "therefore , the electromagnetic induction actually plays a role of the inertia for the growth of the perturbation and reduces the growth rate , but never stop the growth of the perturbation .",
    "the obtained growth rate is exactly the same as the result deduced by the full linear analysis based on the plasma kinetic theory where the induction effect is also taken into account ( e.g. melrose 1986 ) .",
