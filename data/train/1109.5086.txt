    "the model of random interlacements was recently introduced by sznitman in @xcite in order to describe the local picture left by the trajectory of a random walk on the discrete torus @xmath6 , @xmath7 when it runs up to times of order @xmath8 , or on the discrete cylinder @xmath9 , @xmath10 , when it runs up to times of order @xmath11 , see @xcite , @xcite . informally , the random interlacement poisson point process consists of a countable collection of doubly infinite trajectories on @xmath1 , and the trace left by these trajectories on a finite subset of @xmath1 `` looks like '' the trace of the above mentioned random walks .",
    "the set of vertices visited by at least one of these trajectories is the random interlacement at level @xmath0 of sznitman @xcite , and the complement of this set is the vacant set at level @xmath0 . these are one parameter families of translation invariant , ergodic , long - range correlated random subsets of @xmath1 , see @xcite .",
    "we call the vertices of the random interlacement occupied , and the vertices of the vacant set vacant .",
    "while the set of occupied vertices induces a connected subgraph of @xmath1 for all levels @xmath0 , the graph induced by the set of vacant vertices has a non - trivial phase transition in @xmath0 , as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the effect of introducing a small amount of quenched disorder into a system with long - range correlations on the phase transition has got a lot of attention ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider how small quenched disorder affects the connectivity properties of the random interlacement and the vacant set . for @xmath12 ,",
    "given a realization of the random interlacement , we allow each vertex independently to switch from occupied to vacant and from vacant to occupied with probability @xmath2 , and we study the effect it has on the existence of an infinite connected component in the graphs of occupied or vacant vertices .    we prove that for any @xmath3 and @xmath4 , almost surely , the set of occupied vertices percolates for small enough noise parameter @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , we prove the stronger statement that bernoulli percolation on the random interlacement graph has a non - trivial phase transition in wide enough slabs .",
    "the two main ingredients of our proof are a strong connectivity lemma for the interlacement graph proved in @xcite and sznitman s decoupling inequalities from @xcite . as a byproduct ,",
    "we show that any electric network with i.i.d .",
    "positive resistances on the interlacement graph is transient , which strengthens our result in @xcite .",
    "we also prove that for any @xmath3 , the set of vacant vertices still undergoes a non - trivial phase transition in @xmath0 when the noise parameter @xmath2 is small enough , and give explicit upper and lower bounds on the value of the threshold , when @xmath5 .",
    "the bounds that we derive suggest that the vacant set phase transition is robust with respect to noise , which we state as a conjecture .      for @xmath13 , @xmath3 , let @xmath14 be the law of a simple random walk @xmath15 on @xmath1 with @xmath16 .",
