    "since the seminal studies of the galactic density wave theory in the 1960 s pioneered by lin & shu ( 1964 , 1966 ) , many advanced works have been done to describe the large - scale dynamics of ` grand - design ' spiral structures in disc galaxies . in terms of theoretical development , it is natural to first concentrate on linear perturbation theories . as synchrotron radio observations have revealed since the early 1970 s that magnetic fields are ubiquitous in disc galaxies ( e.g. sofue , fujimoto & wielebinski 1986 ; beck et al .",
    "1996 ; zweibel & heiles 1997 ; brown , taylor , wielebinski & mueller 2003 ) , magnetic fields have been recognized as an important aspect in the model treatment of spiral galaxies and thus the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) density wave theory was developed ( fan & lou 1996 ; lou & fan 1998 ) . over the past decade , a research area has been developed on the so - called scale - free discs and perturbation structures therein ( e.g. syer & tremaine 1996 ; shu et al .",
    "2000 ; shen & lou 2004 ; lou & zou 2004 ; shen , liu & lou 2005 ; lou & zou 2006 ; wu & lou 2006 ; lou & bai 2006 ) .",
    "the scale - free condition corresponds to a power - law dependence of all physical quantities on the cylindrical radius @xmath8 , for example , the background surface mass density is @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a constant scaling index .",
    "such analysis was first initiated for relatively simple models of only one gas disc .",
    "we are now able to explore a composite system of a stellar disc and an isopedically magnetized gas disc embedded in a dark matter halo . for this overall configuration ,",
    "we study possible large - scale perturbation structures and stationary mhd density waves . to simplify the mathematical treatment ,",
    "the stellar disc is approximated as a fluid and the magnetized gaseous disc as a magnetofluid and both are assumed to be geometrically razor - thin and scale - free discs . in general situations , the scaling exponent @xmath10 may vary radially in a certain range for different disc galaxies . for more or less flat rotation curves which can be grossly determined in many spiral galaxies from large radii to the centre ( e.g. rubin 1965 ; roberts & rots 1973 ; krumm & salpeter 1976 , 1977 ; bosma 1981 ; kent 1986 , 1987 , 1988 ) , index @xmath10",
    "may be regarded as almost zero . according to the classical newtonian gravity theory ,",
    "a significantly larger amount of mass than the visible mass of the disc is needed in order to sustain observed grossly flat rotation curves . as a consequence of this discrepancy between the visible and the required mass as well as the disc stability property ,",
    "the presence of a massive dark matter halo has been proposed ( e.g. ostriker & peebles 1973 ; ostriker et al .",
    "1974 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "nowadays , the inclusion of a massive axisymmetric dark matter halo is a common practice for studying large - scale galactic dynamics .",
    "meanwhile , observations of disc galaxies nowadays can be used to estimate open magnetic field strengths and configurations on both sides of a galactic disc plane .",
    "while these open magnetic fields are most certainly interlaced with closed coplanar magnetic fields , at this stage of our theoretical model development , we consider only open magnetic field crossing the disc plane almost vertically .",
    "shu & li ( 1997 ) introduced the so - called isopedic condition of @xmath11 where @xmath0 is the @xmath12component of the magnetic field and @xmath2 is the gas disc surface mass density .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 thus remains constant in time and space .",
    "this situation is referred to as the isopedic magnetic field configuration .",
    "in fact , this constant ratio can be actually inferred by the magnetic field - freezing effect according to the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations ( lou & wu 2005 ) .",
    "effective modifications to the gravitational potential and the gas pressure are derived in shu & li ( 1997 ) for a single isopedically magnetized gas disc .",
    "this isopedic condition was first proposed as an _ ansatz _ based on numerical simulations of magnetized cloud core formation through ambipolar diffusions ( e.g. nakano 1979 ; lizano & shu 1989 ; and references cited in shu & li 1997 ) . on the basis of earlier work of shu & li ( 1997 ) ,",
    "lou & wu ( 2005 ) generalize their results into theorems for two gravitationally coupled discs where only the gas disc is isopedically magnetized .",
    "moreover , they actually demonstrate that a constant ratio @xmath14 , with @xmath3 being the gravitational constant , can be proved as a consequence of frozen - in condition by the standard ideal nonlinear mhd equations . in this model analysis",
    ", we shall adopt the same expressions of lou & wu ( 2005 ) for the effect of an isopedic magnetic field anchored in the gas disc component .    in order to catch the essence of mhd density wave equations from analytical and numerical explorations , a few assumptions and simplifications",
    "are invoked such as the stationary condition in our frame of reference . as first advanced and hypothesized by lin & shu ( 1966 ) , the quasi - stationary spiral structure ( qsss ) has been studied since the early 1960 s ( e.g. bertin & lin 1996 and extensive references therein ) . there",
    "the pattern speed of density wave travels very slowly as compared to the differential rotation speed @xmath15 of the disc matter .",
    "our stationary requirement can be simply regarded as a limiting case of the qsss approximation . based on observations of the nearby spiral galaxy m81 ,",
    "visser ( 1980a , b ) has shown that the density wave theory does indeed account for gross aspects of the large - scale dynamics of this spiral galaxy .",
    "kendall et al . ( 2008 ) presented further observational data analysis of the nearby galaxy m81 , where the large - scale spatial offset between the ( old ) stellar spiral wave and the gas shock front was examined .",
    "theoretical considerations ( e.g. gittins & clarke 2004 ; chakrabarti 2008 ) have shown that the offset between the gas shock front ( i.e. the maximum gas density ) and the spiral potential minimum ( determined by the spiral pattern in the old stellar disc component ) may yield clues about the lifetime of a spiral pattern . by comparing observational results with the predictions of gittins & clarke ( 2004 ) , kendall et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found that the galaxy m81 probably possesses a long - lived spiral pattern .",
    "very recently , chakrabarti ( 2008 ) performed numerical simulations to demonstrate that an angular momentum transport takes place from gas to stars in a composite system , leading to an approximately time - steady spiral structure in the stellar disc component ( treated as collisionless n - body particles ) . a major part that plays an important role is the relatively cold gas disc particles modelled by smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) and is dissipative due to an artificial viscosity . regarding the spiral structure in the gaseous disc component , chakrabarti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown , that the so - called ultraharmonic resonances that the gas experiences in a fixed stellar spiral potential can lead to highly time - dependent gas responses , not allowing long - lived spiral patterns in the gas disc . in our model of a composite disc system , there is no fixed stellar potential but rather stellar and gaseous discs are gravitationally coupled to each other in terms of dynamical adjustment . while the simulation results reveal only a long - lived stellar spiral pattern , for our semi - analytical calculations , a stationary requirement for both spiral patterns in stellar and gaseous discs may be imposed without inconsistency .",
    "this offers a useful construct for modelling large - scale patterns in isopedically magnetized spiral galaxies .",
    "theoretically , two classes of stationary mhd density wave solutions with in - phase and out - of - phase density perturbations are expected to exist in a composite disc system according to lou & shen ( 2003 ) .",
    "the physical reason for these two different couplings between the stellar and gaseous discs is a dynamic interplay between star formation and gas clumping processes ( shen & lou 2004 ) .",
    "when the surface mass densities are out of phase , the self - gravity of the composite disc system is reduced .",
    "the azimuthal propagation of density wave is therefore faster and if a stationary configuration is desired , then the disc should rotate faster .",
    "when the surface mass densities are in phase , the self - gravity is enhanced .",
    "the azimuthal propagation of the density wave is slower and the disc should then rotate slower in order to maintain a stationary configuration ( lou & shen 2003 ) .",
    "our present investigation mainly focuses on the variation of the amount of dark matter in the halo needed to sustain stationary perturbation configurations as the isopedic magnetic field strength varies .",
    "therefore , we use typical values of disc galaxies for different parameters such as the ` sound speed ' or the surface mass density . by invoking several physical requirements for the dark matter halo such as a non - negative potential ratio and so forth , the physical parameter range of stationary perturbation solutions can be identified . in section [ sec :",
    "nomenclature ] , the problem formulation , the basic formulae and the coupled fluid and magnetofluid equations for the two discs are presented . in section [ sec : magnetic field ] , we discuss effective modifications to the gravitational potential and the enthalpy in the gas disc when an isopedic magnetic field is introduced . in section [ sec : equilibrium ] , we derive several relevant relations for the background rotational equilibrium configuration . in section",
    "[ sec : mhd perturbations ] , mhd perturbations are introduced and the relevant global stationary dispersion relation is derived . for globally stationary mhd perturbation configurations , we calculate the dark matter amount and discuss which parameters affect this amount .",
    "section [ sec : parameters ] describes briefly the values for the parameters adopted for this model analysis . in section [ sec : nu=0 ] , we study aligned cases where perturbations of different radii can be aligned radially . in section",
    "[ sec : nu!=0 ] , we study unaligned logarithmic spiral cases with a constant radial flux of angular momentum .",
    "such unaligned cases have mhd perturbations which are systematically phase shifted azimuthally as a function of radius @xmath8 .",
    "in unaligned cases , mhd density waves propagate in both azimuthal and radial directions .",
    "the constant radial flux of angular momentum is realized by setting the perturbation scale - free index @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( e.g. goldreich & tremaine 1979 ; shen et al .",
    "2005 ) . in section",
    "[ sec : limits ] , we discuss two limiting cases of no magnetic field and only a single isopedically magnetized gaseous disc . in the last section 10 ,",
    "we summarize our work and draw conclusions .",
    "we first introduce notations for the relevant physical variables used in our model formulation and analysis .",
    "we largely adopt the same nomenclature of wu & lou ( 2005 ) for a model of a single scale - free disc with an isopedic magnetic field . whenever the superscript @xmath18 is attached to a physical variable ,",
    "the relevant equation is valid for both stellar @xmath19 and gaseous @xmath20 discs in parallel .",
    "cylindrical coordinates @xmath21 are adopted for our model formulation and we confine our analysis within the @xmath22 plane for an infinitely thin composite disc system in differential rotation . for example , variable @xmath23 is the two - dimensional surface mass density of the stellar disc and @xmath24 is that of the isopedically magnetized gas disc . the total surface mass density @xmath25 is the sum of these two disc surface mass densities .",
    "two different coplanar bulk flow velocities are possible in the two discs : the radial bulk flow velocity @xmath26 and the azimuthal bulk flow velocity @xmath27 . for the background rotational equilibrium disc configuration of axisymmetry",
    ", the radial flow velocities should vanish . the two - dimensional pressure ( i.e. vertically integrated pressure ) in each disc",

    "the following integral relations exist , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the three - dimensional pressure and @xmath31 is the three - dimensional mass density , and @xmath32 is the disc thickness presumed to be very small compared to radius @xmath8 .",

    "more and more stars are born and die and thus the disc mass ratio @xmath141 decreases slowly with time . with this scenario in mind ,",

    "the influence of magnetic fields there is also stronger as the curve @xmath174 there varies significantly over a larger range of @xmath4 , indicating a wider range for magnetic field strengths .",
    "this brings out an extremely interesting evolutionary perspective for speculations .",
    "observationally , the global star formation rate ( sfr ) in spiral galaxies is an important indicative parameter to characterize the galactic evolution .",
    "conceptually , if one attempts to relate this sfr with disc instabilities , the application of toomre s criterion ( safonov 1960 ; toomre 1964 ) to a stellar disc alone would be insufficient because stars are directly born in the gaseous disc .",
    "following this line of reasoning , one needs at least to explore instabilities in a composite system of stellar and gas discs ( e.g. lou & fan 1998 , 2000 and references therein ) in the presence of a massive dark matter halo .",
    "the importance of magnetic fields is generally recognized in the dynamics of star - forming cloud cores .",
    "nevertheless , how to specifically relate physical processes of star formation in clouds on much smaller scales and of large - scale disc instabilities remains a challenging problem due to the tremendous differences in scales . in spite of this challenge",
    ", we have developed intuitive feelings that regions of high gas density and strong magnetic fields on large scales are expected to be vulnerable or favorable to active star formation processes .",

    "dark matter halo , magnetic field , and higher gas fraction ( i.e. larger @xmath141 ) in a composite disc system .",
    "the initial conditions for forming a proto - galactic disc nebula such as the dark matter halo , gas disc and magnetic field are expected to be statistical with fluctuations .",
    "the instability properties of such a magnetized disc system in the presence of a dark matter halo may then grossly determine the global sfr and thus the galactic evolution .",
    "in other words , different initial conditions can lead to different kinds of evolutionary tracks .",
    "in particular , it is conceivable that the sfr may have highs and lows along galactic evolutionary paths in the expanding universe .",
    "this information would be valuable for understanding the overall cosmological evolution in terms of global sfrs of spiral galaxies . to compare a late - type spiral galaxy with an early - type spiral galaxy",

    "can only exist for strong magnetic fields while in an earlier stage of evolution , such solutions can exist for almost all @xmath4 values .",
    "these results suggest that multiple - armed disc galaxies may be more numerous in the early universe",
    ". it may be possible for disc galaxies to change patterns during the course of their evolution . conceivably evolving on cosmological timescales ,",
    "a disc galaxy pattern may alternately become stationary or quasi - stationary as evidenced by the fact of changing @xmath141 and @xmath4 , e.g. @xmath133 and @xmath212 are shifted towards smaller @xmath4 for stationary configurations .",

    "for example in numerical simulations , one may start from initially stationary perturbation configurations and then explore time - dependent quasi - stationary behaviours as well as nonlinear effects of a composite disc system by adjusting one or several relevant parameters systematically .",
    "parameter @xmath217 characterizing radial variations of coplanar perturbations affects @xmath133 ratio in many ways .",
    "for example , in spiral galaxies with more tightly wound logarithmic spiral arms ( i.e. larger @xmath217 ) , more dark matter is needed in the massive halo to sustain stationary perturbation configurations . furthermore , with increasing @xmath217 towards the wkbj regime , each @xmath133 may correspond to multiple stationary configurations . for very small @xmath217 in the opposite limit ,",
    "only perturbation configurations with @xmath128 have stationary solutions ( i.e. lopsided configurations ) .",
    "stationary perturbations with @xmath128 also have solutions for larger @xmath217 , but only in a certain range of @xmath222 .",
    "larger @xmath217 values have one stationary solution for all @xmath212 ( see appendix b ) , namely the @xmath223 root of expression ( [ roots ] ) . if @xmath217 is increased further , then the second root @xmath215 of expression ( [ roots ] )",

    "5 for large @xmath141 ) , stationary perturbation solutions for @xmath212 can be found for every chosen parameter set . for @xmath128 , solutions exist in a certain range of @xmath4 .",
    "for example for @xmath211 and @xmath228 , the case of @xmath128 has @xmath133 roots for @xmath229 ( see the right panel of fig . 5 ) .",
    "to conclude for @xmath227 , for small @xmath217 or @xmath182 , all @xmath125 values have one @xmath133 root .",
    "but for larger @xmath217 , the case of @xmath212 can have two @xmath133 roots .",
    "this is the same as that of @xmath230 .",
    "the difference lies in the values of @xmath133 .",
    "the larger the ` radial wavenumber ' @xmath217 value is , the larger are the potential ratios @xmath223 and @xmath215 . for late - type spiral galaxies and unaligned logarithmic cases , a weak magnetic field does not play a significant role as expected .",
    "the younger the spiral galaxy is , the more important the role of a magnetic field especially in the regime of stronger magnetic fields .",
    "for very strong magnetic fields , it appears that @xmath133 ratio is more closely connected to the magnetic field and the effect of magnetic fields can not be ignored .",
    "but for weak magnetic fields , @xmath133 ratio remains more or less constant for all types of spiral galaxies .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "first of all , we emphasize that the lopsided global configuration @xmath128 is an exceptional case for which the curve @xmath174 has a distinctly different shape as compared to those for the cases @xmath212 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "for both aligned and unaligned logarithmic spiral cases with @xmath212 , strong magnetic fields ( still realistic in spiral galaxies ) can bear a significant relation to the dark matter halo in maintaining globally stationary perturbation configurations .",
    "physically , we conclude that in spiral galaxies with or without radial variations in perturbations , weak magnetic fields do not influence stationary perturbation configurations .",
    "but when the magnetic field strength is increased , a globally stationary perturbation configuration would then become non - stationary if the @xmath133 ratio is not high enough for the increased magnetic field strength .",
    "a change of perturbation patterns might be possible during the course of the galaxy evolution .",
    "for example , flocculent galaxies might represent the transitional phase for global pattern changes of galaxies .",
    "this prediction may be tested by numerical simulations and by deep survey of morphological observations for galaxies in the early universe .",
    "our model analysis has shown that the magnetic field needs to be sensibly chosen with other given disc parameters in order to maintain a global perturbation configuration with a stationary pattern in our frame of reference .",
    "therefore , a variation or an adjustment of @xmath0 may put a stationary perturbation configuration into a non - stationary one or a non - stationary perturbation configuration into a stationary one because there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the potential ratio @xmath133 and a sufficiently strong magnetic field @xmath0 for globally stationary perturbation configurations .",
    "for such a stationary disc balance in general , the potential ratio @xmath133 can vary in a considerably large range depending on the choice of other relevant parameters in sensible regimes .",
    "as expected on intuitive ground , sufficiently weak magnetic fields exert fairly small influence on stationary perturbation configurations in our composite model .",
    "the main reason is that the magnetic pressure and tension together are not strong enough as compared with other forces which play important dynamic roles in our composite system .",
    "in the regime of weak magnetic fields , there also exist instabilities widely explored in the literature .",
    "the magneto - jeans instability ( mji ) is an instability which is based on background in - plane magnetic fields . in recent years , several authors ( e.g. kim & ostriker 2001 ; kim , ostriker & stone 2002 ; shetty & ostriker 2006 ) have performed numerical mhd simulations for galaxies . in particular , they studied azimuthal magnetic fields that lie in the disc plane ( see also lou & zou 2004 , 2006 ; lou & bai 2006 ) . for our study of isopedic magnetic fields , as already mentioned , lou & wu ( 2005 ) have proved that a constant @xmath4 is a consequence of the frozen - in condition on magnetic flux ( see also wu & lou 2006 ) .",
    "our composite mhd model offers a two - dimensional description of an isopedic magnetic field . due to the idealization of razor - thin discs ,",
    "perturbations lie in the galactic plane and have no @xmath231components .",
    "hence , a treatment of the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is impossible due to its necessary requirement of a perturbation @xmath232 along @xmath233direction ( chandrasekhar 1960 ; balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ; balbus 2003 ) .",
    "when switching over to discs of finite thicknesses , the mri must be included and a larger @xmath133 is probably needed in order to counteract mris . with our theory ,",
    "the range of strong vertical magnetic fields is well studied , whereas the effect of weak magnetic fields is underestimated since we do not account for mris which play an important role for weak magnetic fields .",
    "the results that we obtain here can not be directly applied to coplanar magnetic fields , thus we can make no predictions for the mjis .",
    "the galactic application of our disc model results leads to two methods which may be utilised to determine either the isopedic magnetic field strength @xmath0 or the mass of an axisymmetric dark matter halo .",
    "first , by using equation ( [ eq:1.a ] ) through observations of a disc galaxy , one can estimate the gravitational potential ratio @xmath133 . in the case of a stationary pattern of a perturbation configuration ,",
    "only one distribution of magnetic field strengths is possible for this @xmath133 value .",
    "this is a new approach of determining the distribution of isopedic magnetic field strengths in disc galaxies .",
    "proceeding in the opposite direction , these model results may also be applied to determine @xmath133 ratio by using observationally inferred distribution of magnetic field strengths .",
    "this appears to be an alternative method to estimate the halo mass of dark matter .",
    "the real challenge of these procedures is to determine whether a perturbation pattern is stationary or quasi - stationary through independent observational diagnostics . in practice ,",
    "the relevant parameters that need to be determined by galactic observations for our proposed method to work are @xmath125 , @xmath10 ( the scaling index for radial variations of unperturbed disc variables ) , @xmath170 ( the scaling index for radial variations of perturbation disc variables ) , unperturbed disc surface mass densities @xmath234 , effective sound speeds @xmath41 , either @xmath4 ( for the determination of gravitational potential ratio @xmath133 ) or the other way around @xmath133 ( for the determination of distribution of magnetic field strengths @xmath0 ) .",
    "it is indeed a challenging task for observations to specifically identify some of these parameters and as far as we know , galactic observations so far still have not determined completely all these parameters with error bars in one galaxy . in addition , this work can also be understood as a preparation for the following study on mhd density waves in such a composite disc system since all relevant quantities and their relations among each other are presented in this work . in reference to singular isothermal disc ( sid )",
