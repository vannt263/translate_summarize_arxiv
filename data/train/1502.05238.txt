    "as a motivating example , consider a situation where an arbitrator has to decide how to split the assets between two partners who have decided to dissolve the partnership .",
    "each partner has a utility for every subset of the assets and these utilities are common knowledge to the partners",
    ". the arbitrator does not know the utilities of the partners .",
    "the arbitrator may ask the partners for information about their utilities , but their answers might be strategic . does the arbitrator have a simple mechanism for splitting the assets in an  efficient \" and  fair \" way ? this is the question that we address in this paper .",
    "more formally , we consider a situation where an arbitrator has to choose among a finite set of alternatives .",
    "two players have cardinal preferences over the alternatives .",
    "these preferences are common knowledge to the players but the arbitrator does not know the preferences . we consider a classical mechanism - design framework .",
    "both players simultaneously submit a signal to the arbitrator .",
    "then , the arbitrator chooses a distribution over the alternatives according to the pair of signals .",
    "we assume that players are risk neutral .",
    "we ask an implementation theory question : does there exist a mechanism that induces a _ good _ choice of alternative ? in this question there are two terms that need further explanation :    1 .   in order to specify the behavior that is induced by a mechanism we should specify the solution concept that is assumed to be used by the players . in this paper we focus on nash equilibrium .",
    "2 .   what qualifies a choice of alternative as good ? in section  [ sec : laa ] we focus on two properties : pareto efficiency and anonymity ( which reflects fairness ) . in section  [ sec : pos - impos ] we take a more general approach , and consider a wider set of properties : the classical bargaining axioms .",
    "our main positive result ( section  [ sec : laa ] ) suggests a simple and intuitive mechanism which is called _ satisfactory - alternatives mechanism_. the mechanism is based on the following idea : each player reports the set of alternatives that are satisfactory for him .",
    "if the sets are disjoint ( i.e , there is no alternative that will satisfy both players ) , then the arbitrator chooses uniformly at random an alternative from the _ union _ of the sets . if the sets intersect , then the arbitrator chooses uniformly at random an alternative from the _ intersection _ of the sets .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ theo : laa ] and corollary [ cor : laa ] ) states that a close variant of this mechanism enjoys the following properties :    1",
    ".   a pure nash equilibrium always exists .",
    "all pure nash equilibria are ( approximately ) pareto efficient .",
    "3 .   the mechanism treats equally both players ( this is obvious ) .",
    "moreover , we provide an exact characterization of pure nash equilibria outcomes of the satisfactory - alternatives mechanism .",
    "the set of outcomes is closely related to the notion of _ average - fixed point _ ( see section [ sec : afp ] ) .",
    "roughly speaking , the set of outcomes is the set of pareto efficient alternatives that pareto dominates an average fixed point , or an average fixed point itself if it is pareto efficient .    the simple and realistic mechanism satisfactory - alternatives is used in practice by the commercial coordination program doodle , see  @xcite , where the organizer of an event suggests a finite number of possible times for the event , and asks all the potential participants to report a yes / no answer about each possible time . note that in doodle the organizer does not commit to choose uniformly at random from the intersection or from the union .",
    "however , in the absence of contrary guidance , the potential meeting participants may like generations of earlier thinkers  @xcite , follow the principle of indifference and use this assumption in their strategy . at the very least it is reasonable for them to assume that the organizer will assign a positive probability to every alternative in the intersection ( if the intersection is non - empty ) and",
    "he will assign a positive probability to every alternative in the union ( if the intersection is empty ) .",
    "our positive result can be extended to cases where the mechanism chooses the alternative in a non - uniform manner ( see section [ sec : non - unif ] ) .",
    "pareto - efficiency and anonymity are not the only possible properties that we may desire of a  good \" mechanism . in section",
    "[ sec : pos - impos ] we consider the classical bargaining axioms , along with several additional axioms which raises naturally in our settings .",
    "our results draw a complete picture of the possible and the impossible with respect to these axioms when the analysis is done on the pure nash equilibria outcomes of the mechanism .",
    "our negative results exclude the possibility of an efficient mechanism with unique equilibrium outcome ( theorem [ theo : imp - u ] ) and exclude the possibility of an efficient symmetric mechanism which is invariant with respect to repetition of alternatives ( theorem [ theo : imp - ir ] ) .",
    "our positive results suggest simple mechanisms for each one of the possibility cases .",
    "the most interesting possibility case is the case of a mechanism that satisfies symmetry and pareto - efficiency in all equilibria , which is satisfied by the satisfactory - alternatives mechanism .      starting with nash  @xcite in 1950",
    ", the bargaining problem has been widely studied from different perspectives .",
    "the axiomatic approach aims to understand what should be the solution of a bargaining problem by introducing basic properties that it should satisfy .",
    "however , this approach provides no strategic reasoning for how this solution arises .",
    "the so - called  nash program \" aims to support solutions in a non - cooperative framework .",
    "the nash program has two thrusts .",
    "one thrust is implementation theory , where the aim is to understand what can and what can not be supported in a non - cooperative framework .",
    "the other thrust puts a premium on simplicity and realism of the bargaining mechanism , and derives insights on the bargaining problem from these constraints .",
    "all these aspects are related to the present paper .",
    "we introduce here the most relevant literature",
    ".    * simple bargaining models . *",
    "the goal is to come up with a simple bargaining model that captures ( in some sense ) a realistic bargaining scenario .",
    "a classical example of such a model is rubinstein  @xcite .",
    "he suggested the model where players make alternating offers one to the other until one of them accepts .",
    "binmore et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the subgame - perfect equilibrium in rubinstein s model converges to the nash solution when players patience tends to infinity .",
    "another example of a simple bargaining model is anbarci  @xcite , who also considered an alternating - offers procedure but with a _",
    "finite _ number of alternatives , where the same alternative can not be offered twice .",
    "anbarci showed that the subgame perfect equilibrium outcome converges to the monotonic area solution , when the alternatives are distributed uniformly along the bargaining set , and the number of alternatives tends to infinity .",
    "the problem is that in these models , every outcome ( including the inefficient ones ) can be obtained as a nash equilibrium ; the advantages of the models pertain only to subgame - perfect equilibria , which require indefinite iteration .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to ask : what happen if we consider a one - shot bargaining process ?",
    "we believe that the mechanism suggested in this paper is a simple and a realistic one . in the example presented at the beginning of the paper",
    ", it is reasonable that the arbitrator will simply ask each player which alternatives are satisfactory , and then will try to satisfy both players by treating equally both players in the case agreement is impossible .",
    "surprisingly , such a simple idea succeeds in selecting pareto efficient alternatives only .",
    "* implementation theory in bargaining . * in implementation theory ( see  @xcite for a survey )",
    ", the goal is to design a mechanism such that _ all _ equilibria outcomes will have a desirable property .",
    "ideally , we would like to have a mechanism for which the _ unique _ equilibrium is the desired bargaining solution according to some framework ( e.g. , the nash bargaining solution , or the kalai - smorodinsky bargaining solution , or any other reasonable solution ) . this goal can be achieved if we are interested in a _ subgame - perfect _ implementation .",
    "@xcite present several versions of finite - stage mechanisms with a unique subgame - perfect equilibrium that is the desired solution ( nash , kalai - smorodinsky , or other ) .",
    "unfortunately , such strong positive results are _ impossible _ if we consider _ nash _ implementation .",
    "this has been established in the literature as described below .",
    "the classical approach in implementation theory is very general : it considers a social choice set - valued function @xmath0 , and then asks whether @xmath0 can be implemented by a mechanism .",
    "namely , whether there exists a mechanism where the set of nash equilibria outcomes is exactly @xmath0 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is its generality , and the surprising fact that this question has a clean if - and - only - if answer , see maskin  @xcite and moore and repullo  @xcite .",
    "an application of the negative results of  @xcite in our setting implies impossibility of a mechanism where the unique nash equilibrium outcome is the nash bargaining solution or the kalai - smorodinsky bargaining solution .",
    "this follows from the fact that neither of these solutions satisfies maskin monotonicity , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "our negative results ( theorems  [ theo : imp - u ] and  [ theo : imp - ir ] ) provide alternative evidence for the non - existence of a mechanism with unique nash equilibrium outcome that is some bargaining solution that satisfies efficiency and symmetry .",
    "theorem  [ theo : imp - u ] excludes the possibility of uniqueness of efficient equilibrium outcome , even without assuming symmetry .",
    "this theorem does use that one of the players may be indifferent between two alternatives ; this is necessary to exclude examples such as dictatorship . in some bargaining models",
    ", indifference is not allowed by definition ; our next negative result , theorem  [ theo : imp - ir ] , does not rely on the possibility of indifference .",
    "it shows ( in particular ) that if we have a mechanism with unique nash equilibrium outcome that is a bargaining solution that satisfies symmetry , then this bargaining solution must violate ira ( see definition in section [ sec : ax ] ) ; namely , the solution must depend not only on the _ set _ of possible alternatives , but also on the _ number of times _ each alternative appears in the multi - set of alternatives .",
    "standard bargaining models usually satisfy ira .",
    "an application of the positive result in  @xcite to our settings implies ( for instance ) the existence of a mechanism where the set of equilibria outcomes is the set of all pareto optimal outcomes .",
    "a disadvantage of this approach is that the constructed mechanism that implements this social choice set - valued function is very complicated .",
    "for instance , in the mechanisms of  @xcite it is crucial that player will be able to submit an ( unbounded ) natural number , which is unrealistic .",
    "a number of papers have simplified the mechanisms of  @xcite , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , these simplifications hold only for the case of more than two players .",
    "moreover , the constructed mechanisms are far more complicated than the satisfactory - alternatives mechanism that we suggest ( this is not surprising because their purpose was to design a mechanism that fits _ every _ implementable social choice function , whereas we restrict our attention to the bargaining problem ) .",
    "another advantage of the suggested satisfactory - alternatives mechanism , is the fact that it selects a _ strict _ subset of the pareto optimal outcomes .",
    "namely , it provides some prediction about the possible outcomes .",
    "for instance , in the  splitting - the - pie \" problem the prediction is that a player will receive between @xmath1 of the pie , see proposition  [ pro : pie ] .    a more recent paper by vartiainen  @xcite studies the nash bargaining problem in the cake sharing game , in the case where the arbitrator is aware of the cake sharing structure .  @xcite obtain a negative result on the non - existence of a symmetric pareto efficient mechanism with unique nash equilibrium outcome in the cake sharing game .",
    "* axiomatic bargaining*. in the seminal work @xcite nash introduced the bargaining problem and presented four axioms : pareto efficiency ( pe ) , symmetry ( sym ) , invariance with respect to positive affine transformations ( ita ) , and independence of irrelevant alternatives ( iia ) .",
    "he showed that there exists a unique solution that satisfies these four axioms . among these four axioms",
    "the most doubtful is the last one ( see @xcite page 128 and @xcite ) .",
    "this criticism led to other solutions for the bargaining problems .",
    "kalai and smorodinsky @xcite replaced the iia axiom with monotonicity , and derived a different solution .",
    "anbarci and bigelow @xcite replaced the iia axiom with area monotonicity , and derived another solution .    following the terminology of kalai - smorodinsky @xcite , who defined a solution for a bargaining problem to be a mapping that satisfies pe , sym , and ita , our main focus will be on these three ( more widely accepted ) axioms .",

    "hence , the existence of pure nash equilibrium have to be proved for every suggested mechanism .",
    "the negative results ( section [ sec : neg ] ) are more general , and they hold for nash equilibria outcomes ( not necessarily pure ) as well .",
    "this paper is concerned with whether , in the bargaining setting introduced in the previous section , there exist  good \" mechanisms  where we have three specific goals in mind for a good mechanism :    1 .",
    "we would like the mechanism to lead to efficient outcomes .",

    "namely , the mechanism ignores the identity of the player who sent the signal .    regarding the third goal",
    ", we will not define explicitly the notion of simplicity and realism of a mechanism .",
