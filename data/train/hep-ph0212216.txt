    "a deep understanding of the behavior of qcd backgrounds is essentially important .",

    "when one tries to do this task , one may encounter the following difficulties :    * the number of diagram contributing to processes with many particles in a final state is very large , * many parton - level processes must be combined to construct a proton-(anti-)proton collision , * numerical instability in the treatment of a collinear singularity may appear , * a careful treatment of matching between matrix elements and the re - summation part must be required to avoid double counting , and * negative weight of events in some part of phase space is not avoidable .    in order to overcome these difficulties ,",

    "the ps can reproduce a consistent result as the pdf . for singlet partons",

    ".    the pdf can give the weight of partons when the momentum fraction ( @xmath72 ) and the energy scale are given by the users .",
    "on the other hand , in the forward evolution scheme of the ps , the momentum fraction of a parton ( @xmath72 ) is determined only after evolution takes place .",
    "this method is very inefficient , for instance , for a narrow - resonance production . in order to cure this inefficiency ,",
    "we have developed an @xmath72-deterministic ps . in a monte - carlo procedure in the ps ,",
    "the @xmath73 evolution is controlled by the sudakov form - factor , which gives a non - branching probability of partons , and the @xmath72 determination is done independently according to a splitting function .",
    "it is not necessary to determine the @xmath72 value at each branching .",
    "after preforming all branching procedures using the sudakov form - factor , the @xmath72 value at each branching is determined to give a total @xmath72 , being a given value from outside of the ps . in this ps , each event has a different weight according to the splitting functions and initial distribution of the pdf .",

    "the initial distributions of partons are taken from cteq5l at the energy scale of the @xmath5-quark mass . then , after evolution to an energy scale of 100 gev , the @xmath72 distributions from the ps are compared to those in cteq5l .",
    "one can see in fig.[qcdps ] the ps reproduced @xmath72 distributions in cteq5l for both of singlet and non - singlet partons .",
    "our procedure to generate qcd events involves the following three steps ,    :    1 .",

    "the probability for the existence of each parton in the proton at some low - energy scale is obtained from the pdf , and 3 .",
    "the @xmath72-deterministic ps performs evolution from a low energy scale to the energy scale of a hard scattering while generating multi - partons with a finite transverse momentum ,    instead of steps 2 , 3 , and 4 in the conventional procedure .",
    "though the ll - subtraction method makes the negative - positive cancellation in the collinear region very mild , the nlo amplitude may still have negative values in some region in the phase - space .",
    "this negative weight is unavoidable due to the perturbative calculation truncated at a finite order of expansion .",

    "the distributions of transverse momenta of gluons are shown in figure  2 .",
    "for the born process , the largest @xmath38 from the ps is filled to histograms if it has @xmath38 greater than 1 gev . for the radiative process , that from matrix elements is filled when it has passed the same cut as mentioned above . if one does not take care of double - counting of the ll - terms in the matrix elements and the ps , the distributions of @xmath91 show larger values compared with the ps in the born process , as shown in the left histogram of figure  2 . in order to avoid double - counting",
    ", we required that @xmath38 of the matrix elements be greater than those of any gluons from the ps in the radiative process .",
    "this double - counting rejection leads to a good agreement of the @xmath38 distribution around the low-@xmath38 region , as shown in the middle histogram .",
    "however , the ps still emits an insufficient number of gluons around a very high-@xmath38 region . if the upper bound of the @xmath68 integration is set to be @xmath89 in the calculation with the exact matrix elements , @xmath68 distributions shows a good agreement , as shown in right histogram .",
    "this behavior tells us that the parton - shower can reproduce gluon distributions only for the energy scale less than @xmath89 .",
