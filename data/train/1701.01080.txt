    "recently , there was an @xmath3 anomaly in lepton - universality violation in the ratio @xmath4 by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in addition , sizable deviations were observed in angular distributions of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the results can be interpreted by a large negative contribution to the wilson coefficient @xmath6 of the semileptonic operator @xmath7 , and also contributions to other wilson coefficients , in particular to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and experimental value on the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment has been a long - standing problem , which stands at @xmath9 level with the deviation from the sm prediction at @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 if one insists on fulfilling the muon @xmath2 within @xmath11 of the experimental value in any models , it puts a strong constraint on the parameter space .",
    "for example , it requires a relatively light spectrum in the supersymmetric particles in the mssm in order to bring the prediction to be within @xmath11 of the experimental value .",
    "a number of leptoquark models have been proposed to solve the @xmath12 anomaly , but however it is very hard to satisfy simultaneously the muon @xmath2 : see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a three - loop neutrino mass model with a few leptoquark scalars in @xmath0-triplet form .",
    "we attempt to use the model to explain the anomaly of @xmath13 , to achieve a sizable muon @xmath2 , and to provide a bosonic dark matter candidate , and at the same time satisfying all the constraints from lepton flavor violations .",
    "the concrete model is based on the sm symmetry and a @xmath14 symmetry as @xmath15 .",
    "the model consists of the sm fields , 3 additional leptoquark triplet fields @xmath16 , and one colorless doublet scalar field @xmath17 .",
    "these fields are assigned different @xmath14 parities and hypercharges in such a way that each of the yukawa - type couplings contributes to either neutrino mass , @xmath18 anomaly , muon @xmath2 , or the dark matter interactions . in this way , although the model contains more parameter , it can however explain all the above anomalies .",
    "the achievements of the model can be summarized in the following .    1 .",
    "the neutrino mass pattern and oscillation can be accommodated with the yukawa coupling terms @xmath19 in three - loop diagrams  .",
    "2 .   the yukawa coupling term @xmath20 can give useful contributions to the wilson coefficients @xmath21 in such a way that it can explain successfully the @xmath12 anomaly .",
    "the muon @xmath2 receives a large contribution from the yukawa coupling term @xmath22 . with some adjustment of the parameters",
