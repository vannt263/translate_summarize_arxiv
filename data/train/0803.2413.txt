    "in recent years much attention has been paid to the possibility that a universe could have non - trivial topology @xcite .",
    "many of high energy theories of fundamental physics are formulated in higher dimensional spacetimes and it is commonly assumed that the extra dimensions are compactified . in particular , the idea of compactified dimensions has been extensively used in supergravity and superstring theories . from an inflationary point of view universes with compact spatial dimensions , under certain conditions , should be considered a rule rather than an exception @xcite .",
    "the models of a compact universe with non - trivial topology may play an important role by providing proper initial conditions for inflation ( for physical motivations of considering compact universes see also @xcite ) .",
    "there has been a large activity to search for signatures of non - trivial topology by identifying ghost images of galaxies , clusters or quasars .",
    "recent progress in observations of the cosmic microwave background provides an alternative way to observe the topology of the universe @xcite .",
    "if the scale of periodicity is close to the particle horizon scale then the changed appearance of the microwave background sky pattern offers a sensitive probe of the topology .",
    "the compactification of spatial dimensions leads to a number of interesting quantum field theoretical effects which include instabilities in interacting field theories @xcite , topological mass generation ford79,toms80a , toms80b , symmetry breaking @xcite . in the case of non - trivial topology",

    "compactification of extra dimensions have moduli parameters which parametrize the size and the shape of the extra dimensions and the casimir effect has been used to stabilize these moduli .",
