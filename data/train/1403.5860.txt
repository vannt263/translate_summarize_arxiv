    "the _ kepler _ space telescope has already led to tremendous advances in the detection and characterization of extrasolar planetary systems and in the study of the properties of their host stars . until recently ,",
    "these two aspects of the observed systems were considered separately , but the accumulation of data on both planets and stars is starting to make it possible to carry out statistical investigations of their joint characteristics .",
    "such investigations can potentially shed new light on how these systems form and evolve , and , in particular , on how planets interact with their host stars .    in a recent study , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mma13 ) derived the rotation period @xmath4 for 737 host stars of _ kepler _ objects of interest ( kois ) by applying an autocorrelation - function technique to the analysis of the observed star spot - induced photometric modulations . after plotting these periods against the orbital period @xmath3 of the innermost planet in each system",
    ", they noticed a clear dearth of close - in planets ( @xmath5days ) around rapidly rotating stars ( @xmath6days ) .",
    "they fitted a line with a slope of @xmath7 to the lower edge of the observed koi distribution in the region of the @xmath2 plane bounded by @xmath8days and @xmath9days .",
    "they also pointed to the presence of several objects below the lower edge that exhibit near - synchronous rotation ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these results were confirmed by @xcite , who deduced the rotation periods of @xmath11 koi hosts using the fourier - based periodogram method .",
    "the latter authors found a compelling dearth of planets with @xmath3 and @xmath4 periods @xmath12days , and also noticed a concentration of planets with @xmath10 .",
    "they furthermore pointed to the presence of a few systems with @xmath13 , and noted that all the planets along these two loci have radii @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper we propose that the short - period void in the @xmath2 plane of kois can be attributed to the tidal interaction between close - in planets and their ( typically sun - like ) host stars , which , over the lifetimes of the observed systems , results in the spiraling - in of the nearest planets and the deposition of their orbital angular momenta in the host s envelope . since the angular momentum of a planet of a given mass that moves on a keplerian orbit scales as @xmath15 and its inspiral onset time is @xmath16 ( see section  [ sec : formulate ] ) , progressively lower values of @xmath4 correspond to the tidal `` ingestion '' of planets with progressively larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "this naturally results in an inverse correlation between @xmath4 and the orbital period of the surviving closest - in planet . using the inferred parameters of kois in a tidal interaction model , we demonstrate that this picture can indeed account for the lower edge of the empirical planet distribution .",
    "our model also incorporates two physical processes that affect the stellar envelope and act to counter the spinup effect of planet ingestion .",
    "the first is core ",
    "envelope coupling , through which the envelope shares its angular momentum with the rest of the star .",
    "the second is magnetic braking , the process invoked to account for the apparent rotation  age correlation underlying the gyrochronology age - determination method for solar - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the braking time is typically @xmath17yr when @xmath18days , which explains our finding that the systems at the lower edge of the close - in planet distribution are generally among the youngest in the sample ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) . the relative efficiency of this process would , however , inhibit the formation of synchronous systems , and we suggest ( in line with previous work ) that the observed @xmath10 locus likely corresponds to systems in which both magnetic braking and core ",
    "envelope coupling are weak .",
    "the possibility that the spin evolution of a star can be affected by the tidally induced ingestion of close - in planets was already considered previously in the literature . in particular",
    ", @xcite suggested that this process could account for the observed orbital distribution of close - in planets and pointed out the dependence of the results on the initial @xmath3 distribution as well as on the systems age distribution , @xcite emphasized the dependence of the tidal interaction on the planet s mass , and @xcite highlighted the potential implications of stellar spinups of this type to the reliability of the gyrochronology method . in this contribution",
    "we focus on the application of this idea to the distribution of low - period kois in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "we construct a simplified computational scheme that aims to capture the main physical ingredients of the proposed stellar spinup mechanism and its dependence on relevant parameters .",
    "we consider planets that move on circular orbits in the star s equatorial plane and neglect the contributions of planetary spin to the total angular momentum , of tidal dissipation within the planets , and of possible planet ",
    "planet interactions , which should be of secondary importance to the modeled process .",
    "the assumption of a circular orbit is motivated by the expectation that the timescale for tidal capture is determined by the initial value of the planet s semimajor axis @xmath19 rather than by its initial eccentricity @xcite , and it is supported by the inference from observations that orbit circularization may be faster than orbital decay ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we approximate the star as consisting of an envelope with moment of inertia @xmath20 and rotation period @xmath4 , and a core with a moment of inertia @xmath21 and rotation period @xmath22 , neglecting the possible changes of @xmath20 and @xmath23 with time .",
    "the basic evolution equations are @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the stellar and planetary mass , respectively , @xmath29 is the stellar radius , @xmath30 is the magnetic braking torque , and @xmath31 is the core  envelope coupling time .",
    "the term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : porb ] ) and the first term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : prot ] ) represent the effect of tidal friction in the star on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the tidal interaction is modeled assuming quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium tides ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its strength is parametrized by the normalized tidal quality factor @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the second - order potential love number ) . for simplicity , we neglect the possible contribution of dynamical tides associated with the excitation of stellar oscillations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as is evident from the form of the aforementioned terms , the effect of the tidal interaction depends on the relative magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in our model setup , each planet initially satisfies @xmath34 and therefore moves inward while acting to spin up the star .",
    "however , as @xmath4 goes down , it can happen that the next closest planet finds itself outside the corotation radius ( where @xmath35 ) and starts to move out ( with tidal friction now acting to increase @xmath4 ) .",
    "but even in this case , magnetic braking soon pushes the corotation radius back beyond the planet , resulting in the resumption of the planet s inward motion ( with the tide again acting to spin up the star ) .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : prot ] ) represents the effect of magnetic braking , whereas the last term on the right - hand side of this equation and the term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : pcore ] ) represent the effect of core  envelope coupling .",
    "we follow standard treatments of angular momentum transport in solar - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the way we model these terms . in particular , we express the magnetic braking torque in the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a calibration constant , @xmath38 is the envelope s angular velocity , and @xmath39 accounts for the inferred saturation of the surface magnetic field at high stellar rotation rates .",
    "we treat the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath37 , and @xmath39 as model parameters .",
    "we derive the koi distribution in the @xmath2 plane by performing monte carlo experiments that employ the parametrized planetary distribution function @xmath40 that was constructed by @xcite for @xmath3 in the range @xmath41days and @xmath42 in the range @xmath43 using data for 372 kois and the discovery efficiency estimates of @xcite .",
    "although the adopted distribution neglects the contribution of earth - size kois , the effect of the latter on the stellar spinup process should be relatively small given that the timescale for the onset of a planet s inspiral is @xmath44 ( equation  ( [ eq : porb ] ) ) and that the angular momentum deposited at ingestion is @xmath45 ( equation  ( [ eq : prot ] ) ) .",
    "the observed period distribution exhibits a sharp decrease in planet counts for @xmath46days , which motivated @xcite to divide his sample into `` slow '' and `` fast '' groups ( separated somewhat arbitrarily at @xmath47days on account of binning considerations ) .",
    "since at least some of the increase in the exponent @xmath48 for `` fast '' planets could be due to the tidal ingestion process that we study ( see @xcite ) , we draw our candidate planets only from youdin s `` slow '' distribution ( for which @xmath49 ) , which we extrapolate all the way down to the roche limit @xmath50^{-1/3}$ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "] we check this approach a posteriori by examining the shape of our predicted final @xmath3 distribution ( see section  [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "@xcite noticed that the planet size distribution also changes for low values of @xmath3 and suggested that this behavior can , at least in part , be attributed to the effect of photoevaporation . since this process is likely to operate on timescales @xmath51yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are short compared to the typical tidal ingestion time , we adopt the size exponents inferred by @xcite for the `` slow '' and `` fast '' sides of @xmath47days ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ) . to convert from planetary size to mass , we use the scaling @xmath54 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . with this scaling",
    ", we find that the final average mass per planetary system in our fiducial model is @xmath55 .",
    "this value is consistent ( within a factor of @xmath56 ) with the average mass of @xmath57 planets with @xmath58days around planet - bearing stars that is inferred from radial - velocity surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which suggests that most of the mass associated with close - in planets is accounted for in our scheme",
    ".    given that , in the proposed scenario , a low-@xmath4 system must have initially contained at least two planets , we simplify our treatment by only considering systems that at an early time contain 2 ( or possibly 3 ) planets with @xmath59days and @xmath60 .",
    "we first determine each planet s initial values of @xmath3 and @xmath42 using independent drawings from the adopted distribution function ( a procedure consistent with the fact that this distribution was constructed by treating planet occurrence as a poisson process ; see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we pick the initial value of @xmath4 by adopting @xmath61gyr as the starting time and assuming that the stellar rotation periods at that age are distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath62days ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we also assume that the rotation rate for each star is initially the same for the envelope and the core .",
    "we then pick a value @xmath63 for the age of the modeled system from the inferred distribution ( which peaks at @xmath64gyr ) of the @xcite koi sample .",
    "this age distribution was deduced using the gyrochronology method , which , as we already noted , can be corrupted by the tidal ingestion process . however , we assume that this effect does not lead to major deviations from the correct distribution ( and return in section  [ sec : results ] to check on the validity of this assumption ) .",
    "our choice of @xmath65 is motivated by the fact ( emphasized in @xcite ) that gyrochronology age determinations for stars with @xmath66days , which correspond to ages @xmath67gyr for sun - like hosts , are not well constrained ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that , in reality , the tidal interaction may well start when a system is still @xmath68gyr old . in the final step ,",
    "we follow the planets evolution over the time interval @xmath69 using equations  ( [ eq : porb])([eq : pcore ] ) .",
    "the physical parameters of our modeled systems are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath31 that we use ( @xmath70 and @xmath71yr ) roughly bracket those inferred for solar - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we use @xmath73 and @xmath74 for sun - like hosts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and reduce @xmath20 by a factor of 10 for late f - type stellar hosts ( model  6 ; see @xcite ) . for each parameter combination that we consider ,",
    "we perform a monte carlo experiment involving @xmath75 systems drawn from the chosen initial distribution . for the 2-planet experiments , we construct two such pools ,",
    "each consisting of @xmath75 systems with specified stellar rotation and planetary masses and locations  one corresponding to g - type hosts and the other to f - type hosts .",
    "the f - host pool is used in constructing the f - star admixture considered in figure  [ fig2](d ) , whereas all the other systems that we model ( including the rest of the ones included in figure  [ fig2](d ) ) are drawn from the g - host pool . in the case of the 3-planet experiment considered in figure  [ fig1](d ) , we add a third planet to each of the @xmath75 systems in the aforementioned g - host pool . after evolving these systems , we find that a fraction ( ranging from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) end up with no surviving planets and are therefore excluded from further consideration .",
    "the remaining ones are used as a parent population for the samples that we analyze , which typically consist of only @xmath78 planetary systems to facilitate comparison with existing observational data . for the 1000-system samples that we present in the figures , we pick the first @xmath78 systems from the respective parent populations ( i.e. , the first @xmath78 systems drawn from the original pool that have at least one surviving planet at the end of the evolution for the given parameter combination ) .",
    "these samples therefore have very similar initial conditions  they typically differ only at the few - percent level on account of differences in the parameter - dependent number of systems with no surviving planets at the end of the evolution .",
    "similar considerations govern the construction of the 2000-system and 3000-system samples that we display .",
    "mma13 fitted a line to the lower edge of the observed koi distribution in the @xmath2 plane by minimizing a function that incorporated the perpendicular distance between the line and data points , and used different weights for points above and beneath the line so that @xmath79 of the points obeying their selection criteria ended up lying above the line .",
    "however , when this procedure is applied ( with the same weights ) to our model distributions , it typically produces a line that deviates significantly from the apparent lower edge of the distribution .",
    "this is evidently a consequence of the fact that the overall properties of the respective distributions are different ; in particular , as discussed below , our derived distributions are noticeably sparser in comparison with the mma13 data in the parameter - space region of interest . in view of this fact",
    ", we implement a procedure that probes only the points in the vicinity of the lower edge of the distribution .",
    "specifically , we divide the @xmath4 range between  3 and  @xmath80days into 9 equal intervals , locate the 3 data points with the smallest values of @xmath58days in each of them and form their averages , and then fit a least - squares regression line to the logarithms of these averages . in cases",
    "where fewer than 3 points can be located within a given interval , the available points are added to the tally of the adjacent , higher-@xmath4 interval , and the averaging is carried out over the total number of selected points in the two intervals .",
    "the linear fit has the form @xmath81 , and we determine the uncertainties in the fitting parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 by calculating their means and standard deviations ( sds ) based on fits to @xmath84 randomly generated data sets , each with the prescribed number of systems ( 1000 , 2000 , or 3000 ) , drawn from the parent populations produced in our monte carlo experiments . for our model fit to the mma13 data , we estimate uncertainties using the method employed by mma13 ( generate fits using @xmath84 random drawings of @xmath85 of the points in the selected parameter - space region ) .",
    "the estimates of @xmath82 and @xmath83 obtained in this way are collected in table  [ tab2 ] . for comparison",
    ", the first entry in the table lists the corresponding values derived by applying the mma13 fitting procedure to the observed distribution and using their prescribed parameter ranges ( @xmath8days , @xmath86days ) .",
    "it is seen that , while our method yields a somewhat flatter fit to these data , the 1-sd zones of the respective @xmath82 and @xmath83 values overlap . lies within 1  sd from @xmath87 . ]",
    "following a series of experiments , in which we compared the derived values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 with those obtained from our fit to the mma13 data , we identified the parameters defining models  1 and  2 as producing the best match to the lower edge of the observed koi distribution .",

    "one can gauge how representative each of these sets is by comparing the lower - edge linear fit parameters for the plotted distribution with the mean values deduced on the basis of all the @xmath84 data sets that we generated for the given case through random drawings from the parent population ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this comparison reveals that the slopes of the linear fits for the displayed model realizations are typically steeper than the corresponding mean slopes ( as is also the case for our fits to the mma13 data ) , but that in most instances the line fitting parameters lie within 1  sd from their respective means ( or nearly so ) . ] in particular , the lower edge identified by mma13 is already clearly discernible in a sample of @xmath78 systems derived from a 2-planet drawing experiment ( panel  ( b ) ) , and its outline for @xmath88days is determined by systems ( indicated by blue squares ) that have already lost one planet to the star , as expected in the planet - ingestion scenario.(b ) have already lost a planet ; in figure  [ fig1](d ) , 43.6% lost one and 23.5% lost two . ] also as expected ( given that the edge of the distribution is defined by relatively rare events ) , the trend becomes visually clearer when the sample is increased to 3000 systems ( panel  ( c ) ; the distribution for 2000 systems is shown in figure  [ fig3](a ) ) , and when the experiment involves 3-planet drawings ( which increases the probability of locating planets close to the star at time @xmath65 ; panel  ( d ) ) . in the larger sample shown in panel  ( c ) , one also finds more low-@xmath4 systems that did not yet lose any planets  these represent comparatively massive planets that are caught on their way in toward eventual ingestion .",
    "( as we already noted in section  [ sec : formulate ] , the timescale for the onset of inspiral is @xmath44 . ) there are , however , no systems with @xmath18days and @xmath89days in which all initial planets are still intact  for planets at these distances , tidal interaction remains ineffective , and the only way these systems can correspond to a low value of @xmath4 is if they already lost at least one closer - in planet .",
    "we thus identify @xmath90days as the approximate value of ( or , more accurately , a lower bound on ) the extent of the tidal interaction zone in this model .",
    "this value is consistent with the apparent extent of the void in figure  2 of mma13 .",
    "it is also worth noting that even the region @xmath91days contains a significant fraction of systems that are missing one planet ( and , in the case of the 3-planet drawing experiment shown in panel  ( d ) , also a measurable number of systems that have lost two planets )  these correspond to spun - up stars that have already been spun back down by magnetic braking .",

    "another difference between the distributions that we derive and the one shown in figure  2 of mma13 is the relative sparseness of the parameter - space region @xmath18days in our model results .",

    "this figure also reveals a remarkable property of our model distributions : the entire ( oblique ) lower edge is defined predominantly by the youngest sampled systems .",
    "although a simple - minded application of gyrochronology would imply that the systems at the lower end of this edge should indeed be the youngest , the unique prediction of our scenario is that systems in the upper part of the lower edge ( those with @xmath4 close to @xmath118days ) should also be very young and should contrast with systems of comparable rotation periods but longer orbital periods ( which would , on average , be measurably older ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but even in cases where the available photometric information is more limited , one can improve the accuracy with the help of ground - based spectroscopic observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another approach , which can be employed when the host star is a member of a binary system , is to compare the derived ages of the two ( presumably coeval ) binary companions .",
    "this method has also been used in the study of _ kepler _ stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , in fact , has provided preliminary evidence for the influence of close - in planets on the rotation rates of their host stars @xcite .",
    "an additional noteworthy aspect of our finding that the lower edge of the koi distribution in the @xmath2 plane is best reproduced by young systems ( figure  [ fig3](a ) ) characterized by comparatively low values of @xmath108 ( figures  [ fig1](b ) and  [ fig2](c ) ) is that this result is consistent with the suggestion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that @xmath108 increases from @xmath119 to @xmath120 as a solar - type star ages .",
    "before closing this section , we comment on the extended planetary distribution function that @xcite derived by extrapolating the discovery efficiencies reported in @xcite for @xmath121 down to @xmath122 ( resulting in the addition of 190 kois to his sample ) .",
    "we applied our computational scheme to this distribution and obtained a final distribution in the @xmath2 plane that had significantly fewer systems with @xmath18days than our fiducial model and , correspondingly , a lower edge whose slope was much flatter than that of the mma13 data .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy could be that the poisson process - based distribution function constructed by @xcite does not accurately describe the properties of multiple planets in any given system , and that in this case our independent drawings for 2- and 3-planet systems do not properly capture the dominant contribution of the more massive planets to the tidal ingestion process .",
    "it is , however , also conceivable that even the average number of planets per star is not correctly given by youdin s extended distribution , and that the relative number of @xmath123 close - in planets is actually smaller than the value ( @xmath124 ) that this distribution implies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to determine the effect of the modeled tidal interaction on the adopted initial @xmath3 distribution , we obtained the probability density of the final distribution using gaussian kernel density estimation .",
    "the resulting distribution for our fiducial case ( model  1 ) is shown by the solid blue curve in figure  [ fig3](b ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that , even though the initial distribution is a smooth power law in @xmath3 , the final distribution manifests a break at @xmath125days , where it steepens toward lower periods .",
    "the location of this break is consistent with the lower bound on the extent of the tidal interaction zone that we inferred from the properties of the final distribution in the @xmath2 plane for this case as well as with the boundary of the void that mma13 identified in the observed distribution ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we repeated the calculation for the cases shown in panels ( a)(c ) of figure  [ fig2 ] and determined that the result remains essentially the same when only the stellar spindown parameters are changed ( models  3 and  4 ) , but that the break shifts to @xmath90days when @xmath108 is increased from @xmath126 to @xmath75 ( model  5 ; dashed red curve in figure  [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "interestingly , the location of the latter break is approximately the same as in the data presented by @xcite , where it is fixed largely by the contribution of the @xmath127 planets in his sample .",
    "we note in this connection that the values of the power - law index @xmath48 that characterize the asymptotic `` fast '' and `` slow '' regimes for each of the curves in figure  [ fig3](b ) depend on our choice for the upper end of the @xmath3 interval ( @xmath128days ) and therefore can not be directly compared with those given in @xcite ( where @xmath129 days , and where the inferred values of @xmath48 also depend on the imposed slow / fast separation at @xmath47days ) .",
    "however , we verified that the presence of the break and its location do not depend on the value of @xmath130 .",
    "these results indicate that the break is a robust feature of the final @xmath3 distribution that reflects the extent of the star ",
    "planet tidal interaction zone .",
    "the fact that the overall distribution is best represented by a model with @xmath131 even as its edge is better reproduced using @xmath132 is consistent with the possibility that this parameter evolves with stellar age ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "our finding that the same basic model can account for the low - period structure of the koi distribution in the @xmath2 plane and for the prominent break in the @xmath3 distribution of these objects lends strong support to the tidal interaction interpretation of _ both _ the @xmath3 distribution of close - in planets _ and _ the @xmath4 distribution of their host stars .",
