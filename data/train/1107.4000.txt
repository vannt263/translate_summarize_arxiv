    "tunable filter ( tf ) instruments are becoming standard tools for mapping physical properties in extended astronomical sources .",
    "most modern large telescopes have tfs based on fabry - perot interferometers ( fpi ; or etalons ) such as the 11 m southern african large telescope ( salt ; rangwala et al . 2008 ) or the magellan - baade 6.5 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the tunable imaging era began with the instrument of @xcite and many others have further developed the technique @xcite .",
    "the current instrumental design is mainly based on the taurus tunable filter ( bland - hawthorn & jones 1998 ) formerly mounted at the anglo - australian telescope and afterward moved to the william herschel telescope at la palma .",
    "the power of these instruments to perform spectrophotometric studies is clear .",
    "they allow for spectrophotometry with an unlimited number of wavelengths that can be scanned within a wavelength range . these etalon based tfs provide a central monochromatic field ( mf ) . outside the mf , and due to the use of etalons in collimated beam",
    ", there is a significant shift of wavelength that depends on the distance to the center .",
    "the instruments are designed to provide the largest possible mf , the wider possible wavelength range , and the narrower possible transmission band - pass .",
    "besides , a proper calibration corrects the wavelength displacement with radius , thus recovering much of the field outside the mf to be used as an extended mf .    among the large facilities hosting such instruments is the 10  m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , located at the roque de los muchachos observatory , that started its operations in the first semester of 2009 with osiris @xcite as the first light instrument .",
    "osiris stands for `` optical system for imaging and low resolution integrated spectroscopy '' .",
    "besides conventional imaging and spectroscopy , it provides the additional capability of a tf observing mode working in the visible .",
    "it covers the wavelength range 0.365 - 1.0 @xmath8 m with a nominal fov of 7.8@xmath12 .",
    "further commissioning tests establish the real un - vignetted fov as @xmath13 ( see osiris commissioning webpage ) .",
    "osiris specifications are extensively described in the manual provided by the instrument team ( osiris tf user manualuseful@xmath14documents ; current version dated june 28 , 2009 ]  this document is referred to along the paper as osiris _ manual _ ) . in particular , it provides the wavelength calibration procedure for radii outside the mf .",
    "the osiris fpi is an ideal instrument to map emission line regions in galaxies .",
    "it provides a high throughput with narrow transmission bandpass .",
    "the central wavelength is adjustable to account for the galaxy recession velocities , and the field of view ( fov ) is reasonably large with a small pixel scale ( 0125 ) . these properties",
    "together with the collecting power of a 10 m telescope , designed to get the best possible natural image quality , prompted us to design the local universe survey ( lusgtc@xmath15lus/ ] ) , a research program optimized for osiris .",
    "lus aims at studying the star - formation history of a complete sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "we planned to obtain high signal - to - noise , high angular resolution , narrow band maps of all galaxies inside a volume of 3.5 mpc radius .",
    "all irregulars and spirals inside a volume of 11 mpc were also included , together with a sample of virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "these observations suffice to produce a detailed unique description of the gaseous and stellar content of nearby galaxies .",
    "lus has been defined within the estallidos project in close collaboration with the instituto nacional de astrofsica , ptica y electrnica in mexico .",
    "significant preparatory work was carried out in order to prove the feasibility of lus ; using the osiris features described in the manual , we made simulations to estimate the exposure times , to choose precisely the filters ( broad band and tf ) , and to optimize the observing procedure . before submitting lus as an eso - gtc large program , we decided to test our simulations and procedures with real data .",
    "the object selected to calibrate the photometric accuracy was m101 , an extended and well - known nearby galaxy ( 7.38  mpc , rizzi et al .",
    "2007 ) , that exceeds the size of osiris fov .",
    "observations were carried out to cover a large region of the southwestern part of the galaxy , containing also the well - known giant extragalactic region ngc 5447 .",
    "the central wavelengths of the tf were chosen to map emission lines such as or the sulphur doublet ( ) , which allow to derive star - formation rates ( sfrs ) and electron densities of the star - forming regions .",
    "even if not optimal , observations were made using the narrowest bandpass of fwhm 18  available at the time .",
    "the precise central wavelength of the filter needed to separate   from   was also tested , as distinguishing the two lines is critical to be able to use diagnostic diagrams like bpt @xcite .",
    "the basic data reduction was carried out using our own pipeline .",
    "then , we reconstructed monochromatic emission line images taking into account the wavelength calibration provided in osiris documentation . from this analysis , we found that fluxes and sfrs were globally consistent with values from the literature .",
    "however , the emission line ratios for both   over  and the sulphur doublet ( ) were far from any observed value and whatever region model . in an attempt to identify the problem , we started from scratch by using spectral calibration lamps to test wavelength shifts beyond the mf .",
    "the result of our calibration is the content of this paper .",
    "we have figured out that the prescriptions given in the manual suffice for the mf , while the new calibration in this paper allows for using osiris in its full capability .",
    "it permits spectrophotometry in the full fov with a wavelength accuracy as good as that in the mf . in our view",
    "osiris is an extremely powerful instrument which could be seriously limited if only the mf can be used for spectrophotometry .",
    "although our work was designed to recalibrate our fields and being able to recover reliable emission line fluxes over the entire osiris fov , it is of interest beyond the original scope , and may broaden the community of osiris users .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : optics ] we introduce the basic optical concepts required to understand both the nature of the problem and the calibration procedure .",
    "  [ sec : urge ] shows how the original wavelength calibration needs refinement to provide an accuracy better than 1 in the full fov .",
    "based on the data introduced in ",
    "[ sec : data ] , the new calibration is worked out in ",
    "[ sec : cal ] . in   [ sec : protocol ] we recommend a wavelength calibration protocol that goes all the way from a detailed test of the long - term stability of the system , to a black - box recipe for urgent calibration .",

    "second , eq .  ( [ eq : flux_law ] ) implicitly assumes the observed spectrum to have no continuum . if there is continuum , then the arguments remain valid replacing @xmath114 with the difference between the fluxes measured in line and in continuum . finally , the upper limit in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper_limit ] ) significantly overestimates the true error when the wavelength setting is close to the peak transmission ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : my_this_eq ] ) with @xmath127 ) .",
    "based in our previous experience , this section puts forward a set of guidelines to carry out an accurate wavelength calibration of the upcoming scientific data .",
    "it involves routine observations of calibration lamps together with the astronomical images .",
    "since no extensive tests on the stability of the osiris tf center and calibration constant have been performed yet , they are needed to ensure the accuracy presented in this work and to identify other possible errors .",
    "the protocol will also allow to study and quantify the wavelength dependence of the calibration parameters .    in general",
    ", the calibration process should consist of the following four steps :    1 .   obtain a number of calibration lamp images during the observation run covering the full fov .",
    "preferably , select a monochromatic emission line from a lamp with a wavelength near to the scientific observation . then , map its positions along the osiris fov by changing the central wavelength of the tf .",
    "2 .   calculate the center of the system using the rings corresponding to the monochromatic lines . check that it is the same for all rings within a reasonable error ( a few pixels ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : center ] ) .",
    "3 .   calculate the value of the effective focal length of the camera lens ( @xmath23 ) by fitting linearly eq .",
    "( [ eq : cal3 ] ) . this equation should be fitted in pixels or in a physical length ( mm ) to avoid crosstalk with errors in the plate scale .",
    "calibrate the scientific images by assigning the wavelength given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : caleq1 ] ) to every pixel .",
    "use the empirically derived @xmath23 and optical center .",
    "we recommend to apply the calibration described here to each ccd independently , and before applying astrometric corrections to avoid other error sources .",
    "eventually , if the instrument turns out to be stable , the calibration will consist only of step 4 with @xmath23 and the center derived in this paper .    for observations already in hand using the full osiris fov",
    ", we suggest to recalibrate the images using the prescriptions and constants given in this paper ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : caleq1 ] ) , ( [ eq : center ] ) , and ( [ eq : focal ] ) ) .",
    "whenever a calibration ring is available as ancillary data , we recommend computing the center and compare its value with our estimate ( eq .  ( [ eq : center ] ) ) .",
    "a remainder is important : as we explained in  5.1 , the trials for determining the best center have been carried out on the raw data .",
    "if the data to be re - calibrated have already been processed ( e.g. , overscan removed ) , then the values of the best center have to be shifted accordingly .",
    "_ existing observations using only _ osiris mf _ do not need re - calibration . _",
    "the approximate original prescriptions in osiris manual suffice .",
    "osiris tf and gtc represent a unique combination to study the physical properties of extended astronomical sources .",
    "they are capable of providing high s / n , narrow band images , over a relatively large field with an excellent spatial sampling .",
    "the osiris tf is based on a conventional fpi mounted in collimated beam .",
    "fpi based instruments provide an area of the fov , the mf , where the wavelength can be considered constant within the band - pass of the tf .",
    "however , outside the mf there is a significant shift in wavelength which depends on the distance to the optical axis .",
    "therefore , in order to benefit from osiris large fov , an accurate wavelength calibration is needed .",
    "motivated by inconsistencies in the measurements of line ratios during an observational campaign , we decided to re - calibrate empirically the equation which describes the shift in wavelength with position on the fov .",
    "using spectral calibration lamps , we found that the proposed nominal calibration suffices only in the central 2of the fov , but fails elsewhere .",
    "the approximate equation originally given to describe the wavelength shift with radius is not correct for large radii , and the exact equation must be used instead ( eq .  ( [ eq : caleq1 ] ) ) .",
    "we identify three different sources of error in the wavelength calibration , namely , errors in the central wavelength @xmath86 , errors in the calibration constant @xmath93 , and errors in the center position @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the error in the central wavelength is intrinsic to the procedure used to tune the instrument at the telescope .",
    "we confirm that the errors introduced in this process are @xmath130 , as stated in the instrument manual .",
    "the calibration constant in the procedure proposed here only depends on the effective focal length of the camera lens .",
    "it has been empirically determined with a small error ( eq .  ( [ eq : focal ] ) ) , good enough to discard the calibration constant as a source of uncertainty .",
    "we have also found a new optical center defined independently for the two osiris ccds ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : center ] ) ) which improves significantly the calibration .",
    "actually , the position of the center seems to be the factor limiting the final accuracy . considering all uncertainties",
    ", the updated calibration provides an accuracy of @xmath131 in the entire osiris fov .",
    "the use of the new calibration makes osiris ideal for studies involving spectrophotometric measurement of large galaxies covering the full fov , such as those that triggered the present work ( see   [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "however , it is of broader interest .",
    "whatever study using the entire fov will benefit from the new calibration ( e.g. , extended planetary nebulae , clusters of stars or galaxies distributed in a large area , etc ) .    based in our previous experience",
    ", a wavelength calibration protocol is proposed in   [ sec : protocol ] .",
    "it will allow to check the stability of both osiris center and the calibration constant , i.e. , to see whether they vary over long periods , when osiris optics is re - aligned , or if different wavelength ranges are used .",
    "in particular , when the blue etalon will be at work , a similar study on the wavelength calibration must be done .",
    "thanks are due to the gtc staff , in particular to a. cabrera - lavers , for their support and for providing the data used in this study . discussions with j.  l.  rasilla , r. lpez , and j.  snchez capuchino , opticians involved in the design and integration of osiris and icm / gtc , were extremely clarifying .",
