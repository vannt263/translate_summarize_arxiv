    "@xcite synthesized cuo with a tetragonal ( i.e. elongated rock salt structure ) on a srtio@xmath2(100 ) substrate . in a subsequent theoretical study",
    "@xcite we investigated bulk phases of tetragonal cuo by applying a hybrid density functional theory approach , which is able to deal with the electronic , ionic and magnetic properties of such a system . studying a variety of magnetic orderings we obtained two energy minima as a function of tetragonal distortion .",
    "the antiferromagnetically ordered phase ( denoted as tet2 ) with a tetragonal distortion of @xmath3=1.377 appeared to be the most stable one with its lattice parameters being in very good agreement with the experimental results . furthermore , for the tet2 phase we predicted a very high nel temperature ( t@xmath4 ) of 800 k , which would perfectly fit the trend of t@xmath4 for the 3d - transition metal monoxides@xcite .",
    "also , the calculated density of states of the tet2 phase agreed well with the experimental valence band spectrum with the exception of a few residual differences related to the structure of the main peak and the presence of an additional peak in the low energy spectrum which we have attributed to surface / substrate effects not taken into account in our previous analysis .",
    "the aim of the present work is now , to corroborate our basic findings for the artificial tet2 phase by modelling experiment as realistically as possible .",
    "this is what we do by describing the adsorbate system in terms of an @xmath5}/srtio_3$](100 ) slab for varying thicknesses of cuo layers [ with n denoting a cuo coverage of 2,3,3.5 and 4 unit cells ( u.c . ) ] .",
    "shortly after the publication of our bulk cuo study , a further theoretical study appeared , which was based on the self - interaction - corrected local - density functional method .",
    "@xcite again , for a variety of magnetic orderings two energy minima were found as a function of the tetragonal distortion , but the @xmath3 values were much closer to 1 than in our work and , consequently , in worse agreement with the experimentally observed @xmath3 ratio of 1.357 .",
    "therefore , the present study also serves the purpose to buttress the theoretical capability of our applied hybrid density functional theory approach and to understand the nature of the exceptionally large vertical elongation observed in srtio@xmath2 supported cuo .",
    "because standard density functional theory applications fail in correctly describing the ground state of 3d - transition metal monoxides , a more sophisticated ( and much more costly ) approach has to be chosen .",
    "therefore , for the present study we apply hybrid density functional theory@xcite based on the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse ) method@xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite . all the corresponding technical parameters were the same as in our recent study @xcite of tetragonal bulk cuo . in particular , 1/4 of short - ranged hartree fock exchange was admixed to the generalized - gradient - approximation exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the adsorbate systems @xmath5}/srtio_3$](100 ) ( n=2,3,3.5 and 4 unit cells ) were modelled by a repeated slab scheme containing up to 62 atoms per slab for the highest coverage .",

    "the lateral lattice parameter @xmath7=3.90  for @xmath0 was taken from the recent vasp - based hse study by r. wahl and coworkers @xcite .",
    "indeed , the optimal hse value of @xmath7 is in very good agreement with the measured lattice constant @xmath8=3.900  @xcite . in order to make the hse computations feasible ,",
    "ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering was assumed although a specific antiferromagnetic ordering appeared to be energetically more stable in the ideal tetragonal bulk phase .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , also because of the small magnetic cu - moments of about 0.7 @xmath9 we expect only a small influence of the magnetic ordering on the structural relaxations and valence band spectrum@xcite , which are the aim of study of our present work on the @xmath5}/srtio_3$](100 ) substrate system .",
    "the * k*-points integration for the structural optimization runs has been done by using a 4@xmath104 two dimensional monkhorst - pack grid , which was increased to 6@xmath106 for the final electronic relaxation .",
    "for finding the energetically most stable atomic arrangement several terminations of the @xmath0(100 ) substrate and stacking of the cuo adsorbate have been investigated .",

    "[ fig:1 ] shows that the @xmath12  terminated m1 structure is the most stable one .",
    "it should , however , be noted that rather close in energy ( only 14 mev / @xmath13 less stable ) is the sro terminated m2 stacking .    from now on , we only discuss the tio@xmath11 terminated m1 structure .",

    "it is obvious that the total as well as the local cuo - projected dos is rather sensitive to the thickness of the cuo block . strikingly , the calculated dos for the ideal tet2 bulk phase and for the system with n=3 - 3.5 unit cells coverage agree well with experiment , quite in contrast to all cases . though the superstructure with 2 cuo u.c",
    ". already displays some film features which are not reproduced in the calculated bulk spectrum ( such as the appearance of the peak a ) , the overall comparison with the measured curve is not satisfactory due to ( i ) a much too dominant presence of substrate - related states which weaken the intensity of the main cuo peaks around -4 ev and ( ii ) the lack of a one - to - one correspondence between theoretical and experimental peaks .",
    "as was discussed for the bulk phase tet2 @xcite , the agreement with experiment is rather good with the exception of one missing peak ( indicated by the letter a in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) and one extra peak ( indicated by the cross ) in the calculated spectrum . from the dos for n=3 - 3.5 one",
    "clearly deduces that the experimental structure is reproduced very well ( especially for 3.5 u.c . ) and the overall agreement is improved with respect to the ideal bulk phase .",
    "in particular , a new peak ( a ) is found due to the cuo interface layer ( the local cuo dos has a very distinctive peak at this energy position , which is also reflected in the total dos ) and the spurious peak found in the ideal bulk phase disappears . finally , according to the dos for n=@xmath23 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the highest experimental peak , can now be mainly attributed to the substrate , because there the local cuo dos shows a weak depression , again in line with the observed valence band spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] illustrates the layer dependent change of ionicity of the cu atoms decomposed over the orbital quantum number @xmath24 . a comparison with the corresponding bulk values for both the monoclinic and tenorite structures is also given .",
    "leaving out the layer distance at the interface there is a uniform trend to be seen : with increasing distance from the interface the cu charge is reduced by about 0.15 @xmath25 ( i.e. the ionicity of the positive cu - ions increases ) .",
    "this change in charge / valency ( topmost panel ) is mostly due to the change of p- and d - like charges ( 2nd and 3rd panel from the top ) .",
    "for the two cu layers closest to the surface the total cu charge is even less than for the tetragonal bulk phase .",
    "this increase in valency is directly accompanied by an increase in the interlayer distance , as clearly illustrated by table [ tab:1 ] .    in general ,",
    "an increase in bond length corresponds to an increase in ionicity : typical cu - o bond lengths involving cu@xmath26 ions are of the order of 2  whereas for cu@xmath27 the value might strongly increase up to 2.75  ( see ref . ) . in our case",
    ", the increase in interlayer distance corresponds to the stretching of the cu - o bond in the vertical direction ( perpendicular to the cu - o layers ) . according to table [ tab:1 ] for the topmost layer of the n=3.5 case",
    "the bond length is 2.87  , being well in the bond length regime of cu@xmath27 ionicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the in - plane bond lengths due to the srtio@xmath2 substrate or the lattice parameter @xmath7=3.91  of the optimized bulk tet2 phase correspond rather well to an ionicity of cu@xmath26 . on the basis of our present surface and recent bulk",
    "tet2 study it seems that the cu atoms appear in two competing concurrent ionic states , depending on the directions of the cu - o bonds .",
    "our interpretation of the layer - dependent modulation of the cu electronic population and cu - o bond lengths suggesting a peculiar coexistence of cu@xmath26-like and cu@xmath27-like behavior is in line with the combined dft and photoelectron spectroscopy study on copper oxide clusters presented by l .- s .",
    "wang and coworkers@xcite . by investigating the structural and electronic properties of cu@xmath28o@xmath29 ( @xmath30=1 - 4 ) these authors",
    "report a significant change both in the cu - o bond length ( 0.05  ) and cu charge ( 0.1@xmath25 ) going from cu@xmath11o@xmath11 ( cu@xmath26 ) to cu@xmath11o@xmath2 ( cu@xmath27 ) .",
    "we can attribute the relatively small charge difference between bulk and surface cu ions ( 0.15 @xmath25 ) , to the aforementioned completion between cu@xmath26-like and cu@xmath27-like environments .",
    "to support further this interpretation we have calculated the charge difference between 2 + and 3 + mn ions in mno and mn@xmath11o@xmath2 using the optimized data provided in ref . .",
    "indeed , the resulting value of 0.38 @xmath25 , by far smaller than the expected difference of 1 electron which would result from a simplified ionic picture , is twice larger than the corresponding cu - difference in our frustrated cuo / srtio@xmath2 superstructure .    finalizing the discussion of the electronic structure",
    ", the gap of the ideal tet2 phase of 2.7 ev is strongly reduced when cuo is grown on @xmath0 : for a coverage of 3.5 unit cells the gap formed by cuo states is reduced to about 0.6 ev , which for the total system ( now including substrate states ) is even more reduced to about 0.5 ev . the average local magnetic moment for cu is about 0.75 @xmath9 , which is enhanced in comparison to 0.63 @xmath9 of the bulk tet2 phase .",
    "it should be noted that the present calculation for the surface system @xmath5}/srtio_3$](100 ) was done for ferromagnetic ordering ( in order to make the hse calculation feasible ) whereas for the bulk tet2 calculation the most stable phase was found for some particular antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite .",

    "the analysis of our calculated results for structural and electronic properties indicates that the physical properties of the cu - o bonds are rather peculiar .",
