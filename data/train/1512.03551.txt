    "@xcite studied the effect of node mobility on the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm .",
    "gossip algorithm has been employed for different applications .",
    "@xcite developed several distributed gossip - based algorithms to solve convex optimization problems defined over networks .",
    "@xcite introduced a gossip - based algorithm performing distributed kalman filtering for networked systems . @xcite employed gossip algorithm for distributed estimation in static distributed random fields .",
    "@xcite studied different deterministic gossiping protocols for avoiding deadlocks and achieving consensus under different assumptions .",
    "in the conventional gossip algorithm @xcite , each agent updates its state with one of its neighbors in random when its clock ticks .",
    "the clock ticks are at the times of a poisson process .",
    "the probability that each agent selects one of its neighbors is referred to as the transition probabilities and the probability that each agent starts the state updating process is the clock distribution probabilities . in the gossip algorithm introduced in @xcite ,",
    "the clocks of agents follow the poisson processes with the same rate .",
    "this results in uniform clock distribution , which in turn leaves the transition probabilities as the only optimization parameters .",
    "the main motivation behind the analysis presented in this paper is to propose and optimize a gossip algorithm that can achieve the convergence rate of the optimal continuous - time consensus algorithm over the same network topology .",
    "to do so , in the gossip algorithm proposed in this paper , the clock distribution probabilities are considered as variables in the optimization problem .",
    "this results in a more general framework for optimizing the gossip algorithm where the case of uniform clock distribution @xcite is a subset of this problem .",
    "first we introduce the gossip algorithm with non - uniform clock distribution over classical networks .",
    "then we explain how the poisson process is the most suitable for the clock tick model of the gossip algorithm , and subsequently how non - uniform clock distribution can be achieved by modifying the rate of the poison process according to the clock distribution probabilities . after formulating the asymptotic convergence rate of the gossip algorithm , the minimization problem and its corresponding semidefinite programming problem for optimizing the asymptotic convergence rate of the gossip algorithm over classical networks is presented .",

    "the optimal answer is not necessarily unique i.e. there is more than one set of transition and clock distribution probabilities that can achieve the fastest convergence rate .",

    "based on this result and the generalization of the aldous conjecture to all partitions of integer @xmath2 , they have shown that the problem of optimizing the convergence rate of the discrete - time quantum consensus reduces to optimizing the second largest eigenvalue modulus ( slem ) of the weight matrix . by providing the semidefinite programming formulation of the resultant problem ,",

    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in our model for the gossip algorithm , once the clock in agent @xmath4 ticks , it selects one of its neighbors , ( agent @xmath5 ) at random with probability @xmath6 and communicates with the selected neighboring agent . upon communication ,",
    "two agents update their states @xmath7 to the average of their current values @xmath8 .",
    "this can be described by the following equation , @xmath9 where @xmath10/2 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11 is the identity matrix and @xmath12 is a column vector where its @xmath4-th element is @xmath13 and the rest is zero . we refer to each one of the matrices @xmath14 as an averaging matrix . defining @xmath15 as the permutation operator that exchanges the indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 as below , @xmath16 the averaging matrix @xmath14 can be written as @xmath17 @xmath15 can be represented in the matrix form as below , @xmath18 the probabilities @xmath6 form a square matrix @xmath19 that has the same sparsity pattern as the adjacency matrix of the graph @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , @xmath21 if @xmath22 .",
    "also all of its elements are nonnegative and each row of the matrix @xmath19 should sum up to one , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "this is due to the fact that when the clock in agent @xmath4 ticks , it has to communicate with one of its neighbors .",
    "based on the update equation ( [ eq : gossip1 ] ) the state of agents at @xmath24-th time interval @xmath25 can be related to the initial state of agents @xmath26 as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "each one of matrices @xmath29 is an averaging matrix similar to @xmath14 in ( [ eq : gossip2 ] ) .",
    "the product @xmath30 should converge to @xmath31 , in order to guarantee the convergence of @xmath32 to the average value or consensus state , in other words , @xmath33 @xmath34 is a column vector with @xmath2 elements , all equal to one .",
    "since the iteration ( [ eq : gossip1 ] ) computes the average of states of agents then the sum of values of agents should be preserved , i.e. @xmath35 . by substituting ( [ eq : gossip1 ] ) we have @xmath36 this means that the vector of all ones @xmath37 is the left eigenvector of @xmath38 corresponding to eigenvalue one .",
    "in addition , the vector of averages @xmath39 must serve as the fixed point of iteration ( [ eq : gossip1 ] ) i.e. @xmath40 , or in other words , the vector of all ones @xmath37 is the right eigenvector of @xmath38 corresponding to eigenvalue one .",
    "thus it can be deduced that @xmath34 is the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue one for all averaging matrices that can serve as @xmath38 in iteration ( [ eq : gossip1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath41 be the probability that the clock in agent @xmath4 ticks at @xmath24-th time interval and @xmath42 be the probability that agent @xmath4 communicates with agent @xmath5 given that its clock has ticked , then the probability that @xmath38 is equal to the averaging matrix @xmath14 is @xmath43 and the matrices @xmath38 are drawn independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) from the set of possible averaging matrices . defining the gossip operator @xmath44 as the mean of @xmath38 we have @xmath45      in the literature @xcite the probability that the clock in vertex @xmath4 ticks at @xmath24-th time interval ( @xmath41 ) is assumed to be @xmath46 ( i.e. uniform clock distribution ) by default .",
    "but here we have relaxed this constraint to enable a more general feasible region for the optimization problem and as a result a faster convergence rate for the gossip algorithm .",
    "uniform clock distribution is obtained by assuming that the clock at each vertex ticks according to a poisson process where the poisson processes in vertices have the same rate .",
    "thus , the inter - tick times at each vertex are rate @xmath13 exponentials , independent across vertices and over time .",
    "this is equivalent to a single clock ticking according to a rate @xmath2 poisson process .",
    "the main reason that makes the poisson process most suitable for the clock tick model of the gossip algorithm is the memoryless property of the poisson process .",
    "consider a clock that ticks according to a poisson process with rate @xmath47 , we define the random variable @xmath48 as the waiting time from time @xmath49 until the next clock tick",
    ". then for any @xmath50 , the random variable @xmath48 has the same exponential distribution with mean @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 , @xmath53 , independent of time @xmath49 .",
    "the memoryless property of poisson process states that at each point in time , the waiting time until the next clock tick has the same exponential distribution as the original inter - tick time , regardless of how long ago the last clock tick occurred .",
    "the poisson process is the only renewal process having this memoryless property .",
    "how much time is elapsed since the last clock tick gives no information about how long to wait until the next clock tick .",
    "another conclusion from this remarkable property of the poisson process is that the number of clock ticks in any time interval of length @xmath54 has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath55 , independent of the beginning point of the time interval .",
    "the following properties can be intuitively concluded from the memoryless property of the poisson process .",
    "* independent increments : the numbers of clock ticks occurring in disjoint intervals of time are independent . * stationary increments : the number of clock ticks occurring in a given time interval depends only on the length of the interval . *",
    "the probability of one clock ticking occurring in a time interval of length @xmath56 is @xmath57 for @xmath58 . *",
    "the probability of two or more clock ticks occurring in a time interval of length @xmath56 is @xmath59 for @xmath58 .",
    "the last property states that the probability of two or more clock ticks in a very small time interval of length @xmath56 is negligibly small compared to @xmath56 itself as @xmath58 .",
    "the clock in each vertex ticks according to an independent poisson process with rate @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the number of clock ticks from @xmath4-th vertex up to time @xmath49 . in (",
    "* theorem 1.1.3 ) it is shown that the merged process @xmath62 for @xmath50 is a poisson process with rate @xmath63 .",
    "denoting by @xmath64 the time interval between the @xmath65-th and @xmath24-th clock tick in the merged poisson process and letting @xmath66 if the @xmath24-th clock tick in the merged poisson process is the clock tick from @xmath4-th vertex , then the probability that the clock in vertex @xmath4 ticks at @xmath24-th time interval @xmath67 is @xmath68 which is independent of @xmath49 .",
    "another perspective on ( [ eq : clockdistribution341 ] ) is by considering the merged poisson process @xmath69 .",
    "suppose that each clock tick in the merged poisson process is the clock tick from @xmath4-th vertex with respective probabilities @xmath70 , independently of the clocks in all other vertices .",
    "let @xmath61 be the number of clock tick from @xmath4-th vertex up to time @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath71 for @xmath72 are @xmath2 independent poisson processes having respective rates @xmath73 .",
    "the remarkable result ( [ eq : clockdistribution341 ] ) states that the next clock tick is from the @xmath4-th vertex with probability @xmath74 regardless of how long it takes until the next arrival .",
    "based on the merging and the memoryless property of the poisson process , it is apparent that the clock distribution of the gossip algorithm can be modified by setting the rate of the poisson process in each vertex according to ( [ eq : clockdistribution341 ] ) . in the final optimization stage we have provided the optimal answers for both cases of uniform and non - uniform clock and it is shown that the uniform case is suboptimal compared to the non - uniform one .      from ( [ eq : gossip4 ] ) it can be deduced that in expectation convergence of @xmath30 to @xmath31 is equivalent to convergence of @xmath75 to @xmath31 . in @xcite",
    "the following conditions have been stated as the necessary conditions for convergence of @xmath75 to @xmath31 under the assumption of uniform selection of vertices .",
    "@xmath77 here @xmath78 refers to the spectral radius of a matrix .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the same results holds true for the case of non - uniform selection of vertices . in other words , assuming non - uniform selection of vertices , the conditions ( [ eq : gossip5 ] ) and ( [ eq : gossip7 ] ) are the necessary conditions for convergence of @xmath75 to @xmath31 .",
    "the matrix @xmath79 satisfies conditions ( [ eq : gossip5 ] ) .",
    "this is independent of the distribution @xmath80 that each one of averaging matrices is selected as @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath79 is the expected value of averaging matrices ( [ eq : gossip2 ] ) which all of them satisfy both conditions ( [ eq : gossip5 ] ) .",
    "satisfying condition ( [ eq : gossip7 ] ) relies solely on the probabilities @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    considering the averaging matrix ( [ eq : gossip2 ] ) , the gossip operator @xmath44 can be written as @xmath81 in terms of the permutation operator @xmath82 the gossip operator @xmath44 can be written as @xmath83 . the last equality is obtained from the fact that @xmath84 . introducing @xmath85 as @xmath86 the gossip operator @xmath79 can be written in terms of laplacian operator @xmath87 as @xmath88 with the laplacian operator @xmath87 defined as @xmath89    to analyze the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm as described above , first we have to define the averaging time for the gossip algorithm .    averaging time [ averagingtimegossip ] + for any @xmath90 , the @xmath91-averaging time of the randomized gossip algorithm ( denoted by @xmath92 is defined as follows : @xmath93 @xmath34 is the vector of all ones and @xmath94 refers to the @xmath95 norm of the vector @xmath96 .    in (",
    "* theorem  3 ) it is shown that the averaging time @xmath97 monotonically increases by second largest eigenvalue of @xmath98 . here",
    "the matrices @xmath14 are the averaging matrices defined in ( [ eq : gossip2 ] ) .",
    "thus optimizing the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm is equivalent to minimizing the second largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath99 .",
    "this minimization problem can be formulated as follows : @xmath100 this is a convex optimization problem since the second largest eigenvalue of a doubly stochastic matrix is a convex function on the set of symmetric matrices .",

    "the lollipop topology is depicted in figure [ fig : gossipfiguresdp](f ) along with the probabilities assigned to the edges . for the case that @xmath510",
    "the optimal value of the transition probability @xmath422 is zero and the lollipop topology reduces to palm topology where the optimal answer for this topology is provided in section [ sec : palmgraph ] . for the case of @xmath511 , by selecting the transition probabilities as @xmath461 , @xmath477 for @xmath466 and @xmath512 , @xmath513 , @xmath514 , the optimal value of the second largest eigenvalue of the gossip operator is obtained as @xmath515 where @xmath516 is @xmath517 , and the optimal transition clock distribution probabilities are @xmath518 , @xmath519 , for @xmath520 and @xmath521 for @xmath522 .      for every underlying topology",
    ", there is a set of clock distribution and transition probabilities for the global optimal solution of the gossip algorithm . a straightforward method to obtain these probabilities",
    "is based on the sdp formulation of the continuous time consensus algorithm @xcite equivalent to that of that of the gossip algorithm .",
    "the equivalent sdp formulation of gossip algorithm can be obtained from that of the continuous time consensus algorithm by setting the upper limit on the total amount of weights @xmath523 to @xmath524 and defining the clock distribution and transition probabilities @xmath525 in terms of the weights of the continuous time consensus algorithm as below ,    [ eq : detailedbalanced ] @xmath526    where @xmath527 is the set of neighbours of @xmath4-th vertex in the underlying graph of the network .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath528 . also for variable @xmath304",
    "we have @xmath529 and since @xmath530 then @xmath531 . by choosing the clock distribution and transition probabilities as in ( [ eq : detailedbalanced ] ) , the following can be concluded for the second largest eigenvalue of the gossip operator @xmath44 and the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix in the continuous - time consensus problem , @xmath532 for the probabilities ( [ eq : detailedbalanced ] ) , it can be shown that @xmath533 , therefore , the selection of the probabilities in ( [ eq : detailedbalanced ] ) is said to have the detailed balance property @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that for all pairs of states , @xmath534 ( the rate at which transitions occur from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 ) balances @xmath535 ( the rate at which transitions occur from @xmath5 to state @xmath4 ) .",
    "detailed balance is intimately related to time reversibility in markov chain .",
    "consider a continuous - time markov chain @xmath536 with unique equilibrium distribution @xmath537 and transition probabilities @xmath538 .",
    "the continuous - time markov chain @xmath536 is said to satisfy detailed balance property if the following holds , @xmath539 in other words , the long - run average number of transitions from state k to state @xmath4 per time unit is equal to the long - run average number of transitions from state @xmath4 to state @xmath5 per time unit for all @xmath540 . to explain the time reversibility , consider the stationary markov chain @xmath536 , i.e. @xmath541 , for all @xmath50 .",
    "it is shown @xcite that the condition ( [ eq:3151 ] ) is satisfied if and only if the stationary markov chain @xmath536 has the property that for all @xmath542 and all @xmath543 , @xmath544 is distributed as @xmath545 for all @xmath546 .",
    "in other words , the process reversed in time has the same probabilistic structure as the original process when the process has reached statistical equilibrium .",
    "a markov process with this property is said to be time reversible .",
    "we have optimized the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm for both classical and quantum networks .",
    "in contrast to previous models of the gossip algorithm in literature , in this paper we have proposed a novel model of the gossip algorithm with non - uniform clock distribution .",
    "this is done to propose and optimize a model for gossip algorithm that can achieve the convergence rate of the optimal continuous - time consensus algorithm over the same network topology . by modeling the clock tick model of the gossip algorithm as a poisson process , we have explained how non - uniform clock distribution can be achieved by modifying the rate of the poison process according to the clock distribution probabilities .",
    "deriving the minimization problem for optimizing the asymptotic convergence rate of the proposed gossip algorithm , we have analytically addressed its corresponding semidefinite programming formulation for different topologies and obtained closed - form formulas for the probabilities and the convergence rate of the gossip algorithm for both cases of uniform and non - uniform clock distributions .",
    "based on the results provided , it can be concluded that the optimal results obtained for uniform clock distribution are suboptimal compared to those of the non - uniform one .",
    "since the number of variables in the semidefinite programming formulation of the problem is more than the number of equations , the optimal answer for non - uniform clock distribution is not unique . in other words , there is more than one set of transition and clock distribution probabilities that can achieve the fastest convergence rate .",
    "based on the optimal results of continuous - time consensus algorithm @xcite , a method for achieving one of the optimal results for the case of non - uniform clock distribution is proposed .",
    "the proposed method ensures that the transition and clock distribution probabilities satisfy detailed balance property .    in the case of the gossip algorithm for quantum networks , by expanding the density matrix in terms of the generalized gell - mann matrices",
    ", we transform the evolution equation of the quantum gossip algorithm to the state update equation of the classical gossip algorithm .",
