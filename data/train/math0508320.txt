    "in @xcite , bokowski used so - called hyperline sequences to introduce an alternative axiomatisation of oriented matroids that resulted in a new direct proof of the folkman - lawrence topological representation theorem for rank 3 @xcite and for arbitrary rank @xcite . using the hyperline sequences approach , linhart and",
    "ortner @xcite introduced a generalisation of uniform oriented matroids of rank 3 , so - called _ intersection schemes _ , to describe the combinatorial properties of arrangements of pseudocircles and proved an analogue of the folkman - lawrence topological representation theorem .",
    "this paper continues this work by dealing with arrangements of pseudocircles where each pair of curves intersects in exactly two crossing points .",
    "intersection schemes for these particular arrangements have a special form and are introduced as _",
    "intersection matrices_. with the aid of the latter and building up on results of @xcite we first introduce the notion of _ embedding of an arrangement in a closed orientable surface_. then we proceed showing two minor results about isomporphy and embeddability of arrangements in terms of their subarrangements .",
    "finally , we prove that an arrangement of pseudocircles can be embedded into the sphere if and only if all of its subarrangements of four pseudocircles are embeddable into the sphere as well .",
    "a _ pseudocircle _ is an oriented closed jordan curve on some closed orientable surface .",
    "we call a pseudocircle @xmath0 _ separating _ , if its complement consists of two connected components . with regard to one of these @xmath0",
    "is oriented counterclockwise .",
    "this component is called the _ interior _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "[ arr ] an _ arrangement of pseudocircles _ is a finite set of oriented closed jordan curves on some closed orientable surface such that    * no three curves meet each other at the same point , * if two pseudocircles have a point in common , they cross each other in that point , * each pair of curves intersects exactly two times .    an arrangement is said to be _ strict _ if all its pseudocircles are separating .    given an arrangement @xmath2 of two or more pseudocircles on an orientable closed surface @xmath3",
    ", we may consider the intersection points of the pseudocircles as vertices and the curves between the intersections as edges .",
    "thus we obtain an embedding of a graph in @xmath3 which we call the _ arrangement graph_. if this induced embedding is cellular , i.e.  all its faces are homeomorphic to an open disc , we say that @xmath2 is a _ cellular _ arrangement .",
    "we may describe an arrangement of ( labelled ) pseudocircles @xmath4 as follows .",
    "consider a walk on each pseudocircle following its orientation beginning in an arbitrary vertex .",
    "whenever we meet a vertex , we note the label @xmath5 of the curve @xmath6 we cross provided with a sign that indicates whether @xmath6 comes from the left ( + ) or from the right ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus we obtain for each pseudocircle a cyclic list of length @xmath8 . ordering these lists according to the labels of the corresponding pseudocircles",
    "one obtains an @xmath9- matrix we call the _ intersection matrix _ of the arrangement .",
    "generally , ( abstract ) intersection matrices may be defined as follows .",
    "[ i m ] let @xmath10 be a set of @xmath11 labels",
    ". an _ abstract intersection matrix _ is an @xmath9-matrix whose rows are labelled with distinct elements of @xmath12 in ascending order , such that the row ( with label ) @xmath5 consists of a permutation of the elements @xmath13 .",
    "we call an intersection matrix @xmath14 _ representable _ if there is an arrangement of pseudocircles with intersection matrix @xmath14 . if @xmath14 is representable with separating pseudocircles we say that @xmath14 is _",
    "strictly representable_.    [ cons ] an intersection matrix @xmath14 is _ consistent _ if for all pairwise disjoint @xmath15 the entry @xmath16 in row @xmath17 is placed between @xmath18 and @xmath19 if and only if the entry @xmath20 in row @xmath5 is placed between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "linhart and ortner @xcite considered arrangements of pseudocircles of a more general nature : condition ( iii ) of definition [ arr ] is relaxed such that an arbitrary finite number of intersection points is allowed .",
    "these generalised arrangements can be described by so - called _ intersection schemes _ , a generalisation of our intersection matrices .",
    "thus , we may apply the following two main results of @xcite :    * the face algorithm .",
    "* first , all intersection matrices are representable . for a given intersection matrix",
    "@xmath14 there is an algorithm ( called the _ face algorithm _ ) that derives from @xmath14 a unique ( cellular ) embedding of an arrangement with intersection matrix @xmath14 in a closed orientable surface @xmath21 of minimal genus @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , there can be no cellular embedding of an arrangement with intersection matrix @xmath14 in a surface @xmath23 of genus @xmath24 .",
    "thus the combinatorial information of an arrangement is encoded in its intersection scheme , so that we call two arrangements of pseudocircles _ ( combinatorially )",
    "isomorphic _ if they can be described by the same intersection matrix .",
    "an arrangement @xmath2 is _ ( cellularly , strictly )",
    "embeddable into _",
    "@xmath25 if there is a ( cellular , strict ) arrangement in @xmath25 that is isomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "the relation between an intersection matrix @xmath14 and an arrangement described by @xmath14 is analogous to that of a graph and its embedding .",
    "however , whereas a graph may be cellularly embeddable into several closed orientable surfaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite , p.  132ff ) , for an arrangement of pseudocircles there is always a unique surface it can be cellularly embedded into .",
    "the face algorithm can also be used to enumerate all arrangements of pseudocircles .",
    "thus figure [ 3arrs ] shows all arrangements of three ( counterclockwise oriented ) pseudocircles in the plane ( we call them @xmath26 ) .    on closed orientable surfaces @xmath21",
    "there is an additional arrangement ( called @xmath27 ) resulting from an @xmath28-arrangement when turning the pseudocircles inside - out , i.e. , reversing their orientation .",
    "actually , on the sphere and generally on @xmath21 the arrangements @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath0 and @xmath27 can be distinguished from each other only by their orientation .",
    "that is , one can obtain each of these arrangements from each other by reversing the orientation of suitable pseudocircles . unlike that , reversing any number of pseudocircles in a @xmath30-arrangement always results in another @xmath30-arrangement .",
    "we remark that no arrangement of three pseudocircles can be cellularly and strictly embedded into a surface of genus @xmath31 .",
    "* characterisation of strict representability . *",
    "secondly , the following theorem establishes a one - to - one correspondence between consistent intersection matrices and strict arrangements of pseudocircles .",

    "given an arrangement that can be described by a uniform oriented matroid , all its subarrangements of three pseudocircles are of type @xmath30 ( cf .",

    "furthermore , @xmath42 denotes the submatrix obtained from @xmath14 by applying rule ( i ) . obviously , an @xmath40-submatrix of @xmath14 is the intersection matrix of an _ @xmath40-subarrangement _",

    "we show that an intersection matrix with @xmath44 rows is uniquely determined by the set of its 4-submatrices .",
    "this is trivial for @xmath45 .",

    "however , it is an easy consequence of lemma [ sep ] that one of the other cycles has to be non - separating .",
    "this cycle @xmath107 consists only of edges of pseudocircles that also participated in @xmath86 . moreover , the number of pseudocircles participating in @xmath107 is obviously smaller than in @xmath86 . hence , repeated application of this strategy finally yields a non - separating cycle with sequence @xmath108 .    now , all types of arrangements of three pseudocircles ( cf .",
