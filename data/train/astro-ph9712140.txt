    "observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) have so far led to the discovery of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in about a dozen low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ; see van der klis 1997 @xcite for a review ) . in most cases",
    "the power spectra of these sources show twin khz peaks that move up and down in frequency together , keeping a constant separation ( e.g. , wijnands et al . 1997 @xcite ) . in several sources",
    "a third peak has been found near a frequency equal to the separation of the twin peaks , or twice that value , suggesting a beat - frequency interpretation for the khz qpos @xcite .    here",
    "we present the results of the analysis of two rxte observations of the atoll source 4u  160852 on 1996 march 3 and 6 , during an outburst . using a new technique to increase the sensitivity to weak qpos",
    ", we detected a second peak at @xmath3hz , simultaneous with the @xmath4  hz peak discovered by berger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite in the same data .",
    "we divided the high - time resolution data in segments of 64  sec and calculated a power spectrum for each segment . during both observations",
    "the strong peak previously reported by berger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite was well detected in each segment .",
    "its frequency varied from @xmath5 to @xmath6  hz on march 3 , and between @xmath7 and @xmath8  hz on march 6 .",
    "we fitted the centroid frequency of the strong peak in the power spectrum of each segment , and we then shifted the frequency scale of each individual spectrum to a frame of reference where the position of the strong peak was constant in time . finally , we averaged these shifted power spectra .    if the frequency separation between the two peaks were constant , then this `` shift and average '' procedure to compensate for the frequency change of the strong peak would also compensate for the frequency change of the weak peak , optimizing chances to detect it .",
    "the improvement in the sensitivity comes from the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath9 of a qpo peak of given rms amplitude is inversely proportional to the square root of its width @xcite , and the motion of the peak , if uncorrected , makes it much wider , reducing @xmath9 .    in fig .",
    "[ psfig ] we show both power spectra calculated using the above method . in both cases a second qpo peak can be seen at a frequency @xmath10  hz above that of the strong peak of berger et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite .",
    "we fitted each power spectrum with a function consisting of a constant level , representing the poisson noise , the very large event contribution @xcite , and two lorentzians .",
    "the @xmath11 error bars from the fits indicate the second peak to be @xmath12 and @xmath13 significant on march 3 , and march 6 , respectively .",
    "an @xmath14-test to the @xmath15 of the fits with and without this peak yields a probability of @xmath16 on march 3 , and @xmath17 on march 6 , for the null hypothesis that the peak is not present in the data . considering the number of trials implied by the number of independent frequencies analyzed @xcite , these probabilities increase to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , @xmath20 changed from @xmath1  hz on march 3 to @xmath2  hz on march 6 , a change of @xmath21  hz .",
    "we tested the significance of this result by fitting both power spectra simultaneously , but forcing the distance between the peaks to be the same in both of them . applying an @xmath14-test to the @xmath15 of this fit and the fit where all parameters were free",
    "we get a probability of @xmath22 for the hypothesis that the peak separation did not change between the two observations : the difference in the frequency separation between march 3 and 6 is significant at the @xmath23 level .    in fig .",
    "[ freq_rate ] we plot qpo frequency versus count rate for 1996 march 3 , 6 . in both cases frequency",
    "is positively correlated to the source count rate , however there is no simple function that fits both observations simultaneously .",
    "a similar effect has been observed when different sources , spanning a very large range of luminosities , are plotted together in a single frequency - luminosity diagram : each source shows a positive correlation , along lines which are more or less parallel ( e.g. , van der klis et al .",
    "1997a @xcite ) . a similar behavior as we see in 4u  160852",
    "was also observed in 4u  0614 + 091 @xcite .",
    "the fact that this is observed in individual sources shows that a difference in neutron star properties such as mass or magnetic field strength can not be the full explanation for the differences observed in the frequency - luminosity relations .",
    "we have found , for the first time , the second peak in 4u  160852 expected on the basis of comparison to other khz qpo sources .",
    "we see the separation between the two peaks vary . in the case of sco  x1 , where @xmath20 also varies @xcite ,",
    "it has been argued that the variations can be attributed to near - eddington accretion .",
    "this explanation can not apply to 4u  160852 , as its luminosity was @xmath24  erg  s@xmath25 and @xmath26  erg  s@xmath25 on march 3 and march 6 , respectively @xcite , less than 10% of @xmath27 .",
    "the dependence of the qpo frequency on count rate is complex .",
    "although for each individual observation frequency and count rates are correlated , no simple relation fits both observations simultaneously .",
    "the frequency of the qpo did not change much while the source count rate dropped by 20% .",
