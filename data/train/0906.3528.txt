    "one of the major advances in the understanding of low - dimensional strongly correlated systems has been the so - called haldane conjecture . in 1983 , haldane argued that the spin-@xmath4 heisenberg chain displays striking different properties depending on the parity of 2@xmath4  @xcite . while half - integer heisenberg spin chains have a gapless behavior , a finite gap from the singlet ground state to the first triplet excited states",
    "is found when 2@xmath4 is even .",
    "the haldane conjecture is now well understood and has been confirmed experimentally and numerically . on top of the existence of a gap ,",

    ", we will reveal a haldane conjecture for _ spin - singlet _ modes in a @xmath0-component fermionic chain at half - filling and for _ attractive _ interactions , with the emergence of gapless and gapped phases depending on the parity of @xmath1 .",
    "the analog of the haldane phase is stabilized for even @xmath1 with all its well - known properties , while a gapless behavior occurs when @xmath1 is odd .",
    "the haldane physics with the alternating gapped or gapless behavior thus translates here directly into an insulating or metallic behavior depending on the parity of @xmath1 . to exhibit this even - odd scenario",

    "@xcite . in this rapid communication",
    ", we will show by means of a low - energy approach and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations @xcite that a haldane conjecture for _ spin - singlet _ charge modes emerges in model ( [ hubbards ] ) at half - filling depending on the parity of @xmath1 . in the @xmath36 case , it is well - known that the half - filled su(2 ) hubbard chain displays a critical phase for attractive interaction .",
    "the analog of the haldane phase of the spin-1 heisenberg chain occurs for @xmath2 and attractive interactions .",
    "we first give a simple physical explanation of the emergence of the haldane conjecture for charge degrees of freedom .",
    "it stems from the existence of a pseudo - spin operator which carries charge : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this operator is a sp(2@xmath1 ) spin - singlet which is the generalization of the @xmath39-pairing operator introduced by yang for the half - filled spin-1/2 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath40 satisfies the su(2 ) commutation relations and generates a higher su(2 ) @xmath29 sp(2@xmath1 ) symmetry at half - filling along a very special line @xmath41 .",
    "the existence of such an extended su(2 ) symmetry in the charge sector for @xmath2 has been first noticed in ref .  .",
    "in the general @xmath1 case , one simple way to observe the emergence of this symmetry for @xmath42 is to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ hubbards ] ) in absence of the hopping term [ @xmath43 : @xmath44 . on top of the sp(2@xmath1 ) symmetry",
    ", we thus deduce the existence of an extended su(2 ) symmetry in the charge sector ; moreover , for a strong attractive @xmath45 , the pseudo - spin @xmath40 is a spin-@xmath1/2 operator , which acts on the degenerate low - lying even occupied states @xmath46 @xcite , which one sketches here for @xmath47 :        the next step of the approach is to derive an effective hamiltonian in the strong coupling regime @xmath48 . at second order of perturbation theory and after a simple gauge transformation that changes the sign of the transverse exchange , we find a spin-@xmath1/2 antiferromagnetic su(2 ) heisenberg chain : @xmath49 with @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the haldane conjecture for model  ( [ hubbards ] ) with attractive interactions thus becomes clear within this strong - coupling argument .",
    "when we deviate from the @xmath41 line , the su(2 ) charge symmetry is broken down to u(1 ) and in the strong - coupling regime the lowest correction is a single - ion anisotropy @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the resulting model for general @xmath1 is known from the work of schulz  @xcite . for even @xmath1 , on top of the haldane phase , nel and large-@xmath53 singlet gapful phases appear while gapless ( @xmath54 ) and gapful ( ising ) phases are stabilized for odd @xmath1 in the vicinity of the su(2 ) line .",
    "we now turn to low - energy and numerical approaches to investigate the strong - weak coupling cross - over and the determination of the physical properties of the phases in the vicinity of the @xmath41 line .",

    "we study here the low - energy approach in the simplest @xmath31 case with the emergence of the striking properties of a haldane insulating ( hi ) phase .",
    "the general @xmath1 case is highly technical and will be presented elsewhere . the low - energy procedure for @xmath31 cold fermions",
    "has already been presented away from half - filling  @xcite . in the half - filled case , in sharp contrast to the @xmath55 case , there is no spin - charge separation for @xmath56 since an umklapp process couples these degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the exact u(1 ) @xmath29 so(5 ) continuous symmetry of model ( [ hubbards ] ) is hidden in the bosonization description .",
    "however , it becomes explicit by a refermionization procedure as in the two - leg spin ladder @xcite . to this end , we introduce eight right and left moving real ( majorana ) fermions @xmath57 .",
    "the two majorana fermions @xmath58 account for the u(1 ) charge symmetry , the five majorana fermions @xmath59 generate the so(5 ) spin rotational symmetry whereas the last one @xmath60 describes an internal discrete @xmath61 symmetry ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) of model ( [ hubbards ] ) . within this description ,",
    "the interacting part of the low - energy hamiltonian for the spin-3/2 model ( [ hubbards ] ) at half - filling reads as follows : @xmath64 with @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "the zero - temperature phase diagram of model ( [ majofthalfilling ] ) can then be derived by means of a one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) approach . by neglecting the velocity anisotropy , we find the one - loop rg equations : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the rg time .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as in two - leg electronic ladders",
    ", there is a special isotropic ray of the rg flow where an approximate so(8 ) symmetry emerges in the far infrared limit @xcite . along the highly symmetric ray @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , model ( [ majofthalfilling ] )",
    "takes the form of the so(8 ) gross - neveu model which is an integrable massive field theory for @xmath72 .",
    "the resulting gapful phase is two - fold degenerate and corresponds to a spin - peierls ( sp ) ordering , with lattice order parameter @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "a second massive phase is obtained from this sp phase by performing a duality transformation , @xmath74 , which is an exact symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ majofthalfilling ] ) if @xmath75 .",
    "this duality symmetry exchanges a sp phase with a long - ranged charge density - wave ( cdw ) phase with order parameter @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "the quantum phase transition between the sp - cdw phases is found to belong to the u(1 ) universality class .",
    "there is a second duality symmetry with @xmath78 which is a symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ majofthalfilling ] ) if @xmath79 .",
    "this duality symmetry is non - local in terms of the original lattice fermions @xmath80 and gives rise to two non - degenerate fully gapped phases from sp and cdw phases . as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , a first non - degenerate phase contains the @xmath81 axis . its physical interpretation is a singlet - pairing phase which is the analog of the rung - singlet ( rs ) phase of the two - leg ladder . upon doping , the singlet bcs pairing @xmath82 has a gapless behavior and becomes the dominant instability  @xcite .",
    "we need to introduce non - local string order parameters to fully characterize the last non - degenerate phase . in this respect , we define two charge string order parameters : @xmath83 which are even or odd , respectively , under the particle - hole transformation @xmath84 . within the low - energy approach , we find the long - range ordering of odd ( even respectively ) charge - string operator in the second non - degenerate ( rs respectively ) phase .",
    "the phase with long - range ordering of @xmath85 is a hi phase similar to the haldane phase of the spin-1 chain .",
    "indeed , for attractive interactions @xmath86 , on general grounds , we expect that the so(5 ) spin gap ( @xmath87 ) will be the largest scale of the problem . at energies lower than @xmath87 , one can integrate out the so(5 ) spin - degrees of freedom and the leading part of the effective hamiltonian ( [ majofthalfilling ] ) simplifies as follows : @xmath88 which is the well - known majorana effective field theory of the spin-1 @xmath89 heisenberg chain with a single - ion anisotropy @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "along the special line @xmath90 , the two masses @xmath91 are equal due to the presence of the extended su(2 ) symmetry which rotates the three majorana fermions @xmath92 . within the spin-1 terminology",
    ", the interpretation of the phases for @xmath93 of fig .  [ fig1 ] reads as follows : the cdw phase is the nel phase , the rs phase is the large-@xmath53 singlet phase and the hi phase is the haldane phase .",
    "all the known quantum phase transitions in the spin-1 problem are consistent with the findings of the rg approach of model ( [ majofthalfilling ] ) with a u(1 ) quantum criticality for the hi - rs transition and an ising transition between the cdw and hi phases . the hi phase of fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "is characterized by a string - order @xmath94 which reveals its hidden order .",
    "we can also investigate the possible existence of edge states in the hi phase by considering a semi - infinite geometry . in that case , the low - energy effective hamiltonian is still given by eq .",
    "( [ majocharge ] ) with the boundary conditions : @xmath95 .",
    "the situation at hand is very similar to the low - energy approach of the cut two - leg spin ladder @xcite .",
    "the resulting boundary model is integrable and three localized majorana modes @xmath96 with zero energy inside the gap ( midgap states ) emerge in the hi phase .",
    "these three local fermionic modes give rise to a local pseudo spin-1/2 operator @xmath97 thanks to the identity @xcite : @xmath98 .",
    "we thus conclude on the existence of a spin - singlet pseudo - spin-1/2 edge state which is the main signature of the hi phase .",
    "line showing the three different phases cdw , hi and rs .",
    "string orders are computed by taking @xmath21 and @xmath99 at equal distance from the center of the chain .",
    "( c ) various charge gaps @xmath100 ( see text ) , extrapolated in the thermodynamic limit from data obtained on @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "quantum phase transitions are located in the grey regions . ]",
    "we now carry out numerical calculations , using dmrg , in order to validate this conjecture in the @xmath2 and @xmath104 cases .",
    "we keep up to 2000 states and use open boundary conditions . when @xmath2 , we fix two quantum numbers for the spin part @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( the ground state lies in the @xmath107 sector ) , and the total number of particles @xmath108 . for @xmath2 , we set @xmath109 , @xmath110 and we investigate order parameters showing the existence of the hi phase and its extension . in this respect , we define two string order correlations : @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : orders ] , we plot these string correlations , the charge order parameter @xmath113 in the bulk of the chain , and the pseudo - spin gaps which are defined by : @xmath114 with @xmath115 as the ground - state energy with @xmath116 particles and @xmath107 . in the hi phase , because of the existence of edge states ( see below ) , the excited state with @xmath117 fermions falls onto the ground - state ( i.e. @xmath118 ) , so that the correct value for the gap in the bulk is given by @xmath119 , similarly to what has been done for spin-1 chains .",
    "all these quantities lead to the conclusion of the existence of two gapful phases on top of the cdw phase .",
    "in particular , the data confirm the existence of the hi gapped phase with @xmath120 , @xmath121 while @xmath122 scales to zero . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath123 in the rs phase while @xmath122 remains finite . in the cdw phase ,",
    "both string orders are finite , which can be easily understood from the ground - state structure with alternating empty and fully occupied sites .",
    "one of the striking features of the hi phase are the edge states .",
