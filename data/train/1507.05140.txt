    "the central idea is to extend the gifs to an ifs on a bigger space , that we call _ extended gifs_. from this ifs we get an _ extended hutchinson measure_. in the rest of the paper , we set up the properties of the extended hutchinson measure and his relation with the original gifs .    using the extension , we prove an ergodic theorem that extends the classic elton s ergodic theorem for ifs , elton  @xcite , to the hutchinson measure associated to a gifs . from our results , we prove a chaos game theorem for gifs . as an application , we get some results on the stability and the asymptotic behavior of nonautonomous dynamical systems defined by finite difference equations . also , we show haw to recover some properties of gibbs measures for hlder potentials through an appropriate gifs that is builded from an expansive endomorphism .",
