    "spectropolarimetric observations of supernovae ( sne ) probe the explosion geometry and the relative distribution of chemical elements within the progenitor s outer envelope and inner ejecta ( mccall 1984 ; see also the review by wang & wheeler 2008 ) .",
    "this is valuable information that can provide clues to the nature of the progenitor systems , the explosion mechanism , and the kicks imparted to newborn neutron stars .",
    "the most common intrinsic source of linearly polarized emission in sne is thomson scattering of photons by free electrons in the dense ionized outflow or circumstellar medium",
    ". optical scattering of photons by circumstellar dust particles is another potentially important mechanism for efficiently producing linear polarization ( wang & wheeler 1996 ) .",
    "however , in the idealised case of spherically symmetric geometry , every electric - field vector from the circular scattering surface , as observed on the sky , will have an orthogonally oriented vector of equal magnitude in an adjacent quadrant of the circle , and will thus cancel out .",
    "the detection of net polarization therefore requires some degree of asphericity on the plane of the sky to break the symmetry .",
    "net _ continuum _",
    "polarization indicates the presence of global asphericity for the electron - scattering photosphere and/or circumstellar medium , or a patchy distribution of continuum opacity .",
    "polarization changes across _ line _ features , on the other hand , can occur for both globally spherical and aspherical configurations , when there is partial obscuration of the underlying photosphere by an uneven or clumpy distribution of line opacity ( kasen et al .",
    "2003 ; dessart & hillier 2011 ) .",
    "these general features are potentially important for both thermonuclear and core - collapse ( cc ) explosions . however , in order for spectropolarimetry to provide information on the intrinsic asphericity of sne , one must have knowledge of the wavelength - dependent linear polarization produced by the differential absorption of light by interstellar dust along the line of sight ( serkowski 1968 ) , from both the milky way and the host galaxy .    a large fraction of sne that have been observed with polarimetry exhibit evidence for some degree of asphericity , but the spectropolarimetric properties are wide ranging .",
    "as studies have progressed in the last decade , systematic trends have emerged for the various sn subtypes .",
    "thermonuclear sneia generally exhibit a relatively low degree of intrinsic net polarization in the continuum ( @xmath4% ; wang & wheeler 2008 ; wang et al . 2003a ; kasen et al . 2003 ) and more substantial polarization across p - cygni absorption features ( occasionally @xmath5% or more ; e.g. , leonard et al . 2005 ; patat et al . 2009 ) , indicating only modest asphericity for the overall geometry of the outflow , yet a sometimes highly nonuniform distribution of line optical depth .",
    "cc  sne have exhibited markedly different evolution .",
    "some of the most well - studied sneii - p have exhibited an evolving degree of continuum polarization , beginning at low or modest levels during the plateau phase and then sharply increasing as the photosphere recedes below the h envelope and into the more highly aspherical he layer and metal - rich ejecta ( leonard et al .",
    "2006 ; chornock et al . 2010",
    "; but also see leonard et al .",
    "2012 , and preliminary results of leonard et al .",
    "sneiin , which are explosions that interact with circumstellar material ( csm ) to produce their namesake relatively _ narrow _ emission lines , commonly show a moderately high degree of continuum polarization at early times ( 12% ; leonard et al .",

    "2011 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2014 ) , and in some cases exhibit a complex temporal evolution in polarization magnitude and position angle on the sky ( mauerhan et al .",
    "these characteristics have been interpreted as evidence for a superposition of multiple , geometrically distinct components of polarization from the sn outflow and a highly aspherical distribution of shocked csm , consistent with toroidal geometry in several cases ( hoffman et al .",
    "2008 ; mauerhan et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "stripped - envelope sne are explosions that stem from stars that have depleted hydrogen envelopes ( type iib ) or that are entirely devoid of hydrogen ( type ib ) and helium ( type ic ) lines ; see filippenko ( 1997 ) for a review of sn classification .",
    "these subclasses of sne consistently exhibit substantial polarization in the continuum and enhanced polarization across lines ( leonard et al .",
    "2002 ; wang et al .",
    "2003b ; wang & wheeler 2008 ) .",
    "sneiib , in particular , are an intermediate class between sneii - p and ib , and constitute @xmath6% of cc  sne in large milky way - like galaxies ( smith et al .",
    "2011 ; li et al .",
    "2011 ) . in the majority of cases , the stellar progenitors at the time of explosion",
    "are thought to have been yellow supergiants or wolf - rayet stars of relatively modest initial mass ( 1020m@xmath7 ) that had the majority of their hydrogen envelopes stripped down to @xmath81m@xmath9 via gravitational interaction with a binary companion ( e.g. , podsiadlowski et al . 1993 ; woosley et al .",

    "; gal - yam et al . 2014 ; jerkstrand et al .",
    "2015 ) , in some cases potentially forming stripped - envelope wolf - rayet stars before exploding .",
    "these hypotheses are supported by the direct detection of the progenitor stars and their candidate companions in respective pre- and post - explosion images from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _",
    "( maund et al . 2004 ; van dyk et al . 2011 , 2013 ; fox et al . 2014 ) .",
    "chevalier & soderberg ( 2010 ) suggested that sneiib be subcategorized into two types of explosions that stem from either ( i ) progenitors with extended atmospheres and slow dense winds ( eiib ; @xmath10r@xmath7 ) , leading to a prominent early peak in the light curve from the extended shock - heated envelope , or ( ii ) more compact progenitors with fast tenuous winds ( ciib ; @xmath11r@xmath7 ) .",
    "the latter subclass appears to be distinguishable by weak optical emission from the shock - heated envelope at early times , nonexistent or very weak h emission in the late nebular phase , rapid radio evolution , and nonthermal x - ray emission .",
    "the ciib class is thus more consistent with wolf - rayet - like progenitor stars than cool supergiants having extended atmospheres .",
    "the classification of sneiib within these subcategories is not always clear , however , as there could be a continuum of intermediate objects having progenitor radii between the eiib and ciib extremes ( horesh et al .",
    "different amounts of ultraviolet ( uv ) excess might also be an important diagnostic for determining the nature of sniib progenitors and the properties of their csm ( ben - ami et al .",
    "2015 ) .    at early phases , sneiib display balmer - dominated spectra and",
    "commonly exhibit a low to moderate - level continuum polarization ( see the review by wang & wheeler et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) , indicative of modestly aspherical global outflow . by the time of maximum light , just weeks after explosion",
    ", the photospheres of sneiib have already passed through the depleted hydrogen layer , giving rise to he - dominated spectra ; this iib@xmath12ib transition is often accompanied by a substantial increase in _ line _ polarization .",
    "well - studied examples for which quality spectropolarimetry has been obtained include the sniib prototype sn1993j ( trammel et al .",
    "1993 ; hflich 1995 ; hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; tran et al . 1997 ) and the remarkably similar sn1996cb ( wang et al . 2001 ) , both of which exhibited substantial continuum polarizations of @xmath13% before peak brightness and h - rich phases that lasted for 23 weeks after the explosion .",
    "the spectropolarimetric similarity between these sne is noteworthy , given that sn1993j has been classified as an eiib and sn1996cb as a ciib ( chevalier & soderberg 2010 ) .",
    "the additional case of the type iib sn2001ig began with a low ( @xmath14% ) continuum polarization at early times , and later rose to @xmath5% after the photosphere receded into the he layer ( maund et al .",
    "2007a ) , similar in behaviour to sneii - p .",
    "the more recent ciib sn2008ax was a rather unusual object that exhibited the balmer - dominated spectrum of a young sniib only during the first several days after exploding , indicative of an h envelope mass that was substantially lower than that of most other sneiib ( e.g. , see marion et al .",
    "the object exhibited substantial continuum polarization of @xmath13% at early times , indicative of an aspherical outer envelope , and developed very strong h@xmath2 line polarization of @xmath15% , stronger than ever observed in any sniib and with large radial velocities reaching 20,000kms@xmath16 ( chornock et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "overall , spectropolarimetric properties of sneiib are broadly consistent with a moderately aspherical photosphere , punctuated by irregular clumps or plumes of enhanced line optical depth in the ejecta",
    ". optical scattering of light from csm dust particles is also a potentially important factor affecting the degree of continuum polarization , and was possibly influential in the case of the prototypical sn1993j ( tran et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "sn2011dh was a bright type iib explosion in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc5194 ( messier 51a , hereafter referred to as m51 ) , discovered independently by several amateur astronomers ( summarized by griga et al .",
    "2011 and arcavi et al . 2011 ) . remarkably , a yellow supergiant ( ysg ) star was found to be spatially coincident with the sn in _ hst _ archival images of the galaxy ( li & filippenko 2011 ; maund et al . 2011 ; van dyk et al .",
    "it was unclear whether this star was the actual progenitor of the explosion , a neighbor , or even a surviving companion star to a more compact progenitor as initially hypothesized on the basis of its early - time luminosity ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ) and radio emission ( soderberg et al . 2012 ) .",
    "eventually , the identification of the ysg as the true progenitor was solidified after the sn had faded , revealing that the ysg star had disappeared ( van dyk et al .",
    "the same star was found to be variable in ground - based images up to 3yr before the explosion ( szczygie et al .",
    "recently , a candidate hot companion star has been detected in late - time uv data from _ hst _ ( folatelli et al . 2014 ) ; sn2011dh is thus the second sniib to exhibit direct evidence for a binary companion , after sn1993j ( maund et al .",
    "2004 ; fox et al .",

    "2011 ; bersten et al .",
    "2012 ; benvenuto et al . 2013 ; ergon et al .",
    "2014 ) ; sn2011dh is thus a member of the eiib subclass .",
    "the eiib designation is also consistent with the photometric detection of the shock - heated envelope phase in the early - time light curve ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ) , although the fact that this phase was relatively short lived compared to that of sn1993j suggests that the progenitor of sn2011dh was substantially less extended .",
    "spectroscopic evolution of sn2011dh showed an early h - rich phase lasting for roughly two weeks , after which the photosphere entered the he layer ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ; marion et al .",
    "2014 ; ergon et al .",
    "the late - time decline in the light curve showed the explosion to be consistent with the production of 0.09m@xmath9 of @xmath3ni and 0.2m@xmath9 of oxygen , and also provided evidence for possible late - time dust formation , csm interaction , and substantial asphericities in the explosion ejecta ( sahu et al .",

    ". however , maund et al . ( 2007a ) demonstrated that using the polarization of h@xmath2 emission for this purpose is probably not reliable , since there is the possibility for subtle blending of other features ( e.g. , hei @xmath796678 ) .",
    "furthermore , if a sn has more than one component of polarization ( for example , thomson scattering and/or dust scattering by csm ) , then this could produce net polarization at the same wavelengths as the strong intrinsically unpolarized emission features ( e.g. , see mauerhan et al .",

    "we note that the asymmetric knee on the red side of the hei @xmath97 profile , which first became apparent on day 30 , is still present through day 86 .    since the forbidden lines seen at late times form in low density regions of the outflow , electron scattering is weak , and thus the polarization should be insignificant near the central wavelength of each line . as an additional means of estimating the isp , we averaged the stokes parameters over the regions corresponding to the peak fluxes of the lines ( 70207110 and 72707350 ) .",

    "the large excursion near the caii ir triplet is clearly seen as a looping pattern that moves far into quadrantii , with maximum excursion occurring for rvs ranging from @xmath102kms@xmath16 to @xmath103kms@xmath16 .",
    "this feature is mostly nonaxisymmetric relative to the 70007450 continuum sample ( shown as a dashed line ) .",
    "however , the fastest caii absorption on day 9 has rv @xmath104kms@xmath16 and moves back into quadranti , nearer to the continuum axis .    blueshifted h@xmath2 absorption creates a loop in the @xmath42@xmath43 plane that , on day 9 , deviates from the continuum axis for rv below @xmath105kms@xmath16 . on day 14 , the large rotation of @xmath28 near h@xmath2 is clearly apparent in the @xmath42@xmath43 plane , but by days 3036 the @xmath42@xmath43 loops associated with this line , and with hei , become more elongated and roughly aligned with the position angle of the day 914 continuum axes . the velocities at maximum polarization for h and he are @xmath106kms@xmath16 and @xmath107kms@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the pronounced variation in @xmath28 observed across h@xmath2 on day 14 could be the result of the evolving continuum polarization level ; the changing vector addition of the stokes parameters of this continuum component with those of h@xmath2 could produce an artificial rotation across the line , rather than being , for example , an intrinsic change in the geometry of h@xmath2 absorption itself .    the oi feature , like caii ir , loops in a highly nonaxisymmetric manner with respect to h@xmath2 , hei , and the day-9 continuum ( most apparent on days 3036 ) , although the @xmath42@xmath43 loop of this line drifts into quadrant iv rather than quadrant ii , as caii ir does .",

    "it can be seen that on day 9 , the polarized profile of caii is relatively broad compared to later epochs . in the flux spectrum",
    "there appears to be two distinct components of absorption , with the most highly blueshifted component exhibiting an edge that extends to rv @xmath111kms@xmath16 , and the same is true for h@xmath2 . for caii , most of the polarized flux on day 9 is contained in @xmath101 for rv @xmath112 15,000kms@xmath16 , while at higher rv some of the polarization shifts into @xmath110 . by day 36 ,",

    "note that the emission features of caii and h@xmath2 both exhibit a significant blueshift of 20003000kms@xmath16 on day 9 , and appear to become more centered near rest velocity by days 1430 .",
    "the substantial continuum polarization detected from sn2011dh at the earliest epoch on day 9 implies that the photosphere exhibited global asphericity while in the outer h - rich envelope . when interpreted in terms of the oblate , electron - scattering model atmospheres of hflich ( 1991 )",
    ", our results imply an asymmetry of at least 10% ; the actual value naturally depends on the ( unknown ) viewing orientation , and on the extension and depth of the electron - scattering atmosphere .",
    "the subsequent drop in continuum polarization to @xmath114% by day 30 , if real and not the result of line contamination starting at that epoch , suggests that the photosphere took on a more spherical configuration after passing into the he and c@xmath115o layers .",
    "this behaviour is opposite the polarimetric trends observed in some well - studied sneii - p , which begin with low values of @xmath1 during the first few months , indicative of a mostly spherical outer envelope , and then increase in polarization only after h recombines and the photosphere enters the he and c@xmath115o layers ; in these cases , the global asphericity has its origin in the core ( jeffery 1991 ; leonard et al .",
    "2001 , 2006 ; wang & wheeler 2008 ) .    for sn2011dh ,",
    "a higher degree of global asphericity on the _ outside _ possibly suggests that some other physical mechanism , perhaps related to binary evolution , might be at work .",
    "after all , in the majority of cases , sniib progenitors are thought to have lost the bulk of their h envelopes to tidal stripping by a massive accretor ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1993 ; hflich 1995 ; smith et al .",
    "2011 ; dessart et al .",
    "interestingly , a hot star has now been detected at the explosion site of sn2011dh , and it is a viable candidate companion to the progenitor ( folatelli et al .",
    "if the strong gravitational tides that induce mass transfer can also geometrically distort the envelope of the progenitor star , or synchronise the star s rotation at a fast enough rate to oblately deform it , then the star could develop an aspherical density profile .",
    "interestingly , recent interferometric observations of the interacting yellow hypergiant binary hr5171a have provided evidence for significant envelope distortion in the primary ( chesneau et al .",
    "although more luminous than the progenitor of sn2011dh , the example of hr5171a indeed motivates the expectation of binary - induced stellar distortion .",
    "if similarly induced geometric deformity in the progenitor of sn2011dh is substantial enough , the resulting aspherical density gradient could provide a means to generate an aspherical shock front and explosion geometry ( yamada & sato 1990 ; steinmetz & hflich 1992 ) .",
    "it should first be explored , however , whether sufficient tidal deformation is plausible for the sn2011dh progenitor system .    to assess the potential for tidal deformation , we require estimates of the physical parameters of the binary system and its component stars . for the case of sn2011dh ,",
    "benvenuto et al . (",
    "2013 ) performed binary stellar evolutionary calculations that followed the simultaneous evolution of both stars in the system to produce a pre - sn progenitor that is consistent with the space - based photometry ( van dyk et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "benvenuto et al . concluded that the most plausible model is one in which the primary and secondary components of the binary began with respective initial masses of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and an orbital period of @xmath118d .",
    "it had a moderate mass - transfer efficiency factor of @xmath119 and a specific angular momentum value of @xmath120 ( i.e. , the angular momentum of the material lost by the system is equivalent to the angular momentum of the primary star ) . at the moment of explosion ,",
    "the model predicted that the ysg primary would have a heavily reduced final mass of @xmath121 , a small hydrogen content of @xmath122@xmath123 , and a final radius of @xmath124 ( consistent with the photometry ) ; the mass - gaining secondary ended up with a final mass of @xmath125 .",
    "note that @xmath89 is one of most unconstrained parameters in binary evolution ; regardless , considering the full range of possible values in their models ( @xmath126 ) , benvenuto et al .",
    "concluded that the final semimajor axis of the system at the time of explosion lies in the range @xmath1271009r@xmath9 , which implies @xmath128 .",

    "see stothers & chin 2001 ) , @xmath139 could be @xmath142 or lower , as a result of the relatively intense radiation pressure on the envelope , strong winds and high mass - loss rates , convection , and pulsations ; such factors will profoundly influence the effective gravity and roche potential , and can act to shrink the effective @xmath143 . if we therefore assume @xmath144 and adopt the values of @xmath42 and @xmath138 above , equation ( 9 ) from frankowski & tylenda ( 2001 ) implies te semi - axes of ( @xmath132:@xmath133:@xmath134)@xmath145(1.1:1.0:0.9 ) , or @xmath146% deviation from spherical symmetry along two axes .",
    "lower values of @xmath139 , @xmath42 , and @xmath50 will , of course , result in a higher degree of deformity , as will smaller values of @xmath147 .",
    "stellar asphericity can also result from rotation , which might become fast enough to deform the star into an oblate geometry if the binary is tidally locked ; this is a likely possibility for extended stars that nearly fill their roche lobes .",
    "if so , the binary parameters adopted from benvenuto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) imply that the ysg would have a rotational velocity of @xmath148kms@xmath16 .",
    "the critical rotational velocity , at which point the star will begin to break up , is given by @xmath149 ( langer et al .",
    "1997 ; langer 1998 ) , where @xmath150 and @xmath151 . for the ysg progenitor ,",
    "the values @xmath152 and @xmath153 imply @xmath154 ; thus , @xmath155kms@xmath16 and @xmath156 .",
    "this subcritical value would generate a rotationally induced asphericity of @xmath157% .",
    "of course , this all depends on the model - dependent binary parameters we have adopted ; a shorter binary separation or larger stellar masses would result in faster stellar rotation for a tidally locked system , and thereby larger asphericities .",
    "a deformed stellar envelope , whether induced by tidal stretching , rotation , or both , will exhibit an aspherical density profile , having a steeper gradient along the poles ; this can have a profound effect on the geometry of the photosphere of the subsequent sn explosion .",
    "specifically , hydrodynamic simulations of shock propagation in rotating blue supergiant stars ( like the progenitor of sn1987a ) have demonstrated that an initially spherical shock wave that encounters a steeper density gradient along the poles will develop a prolate - shaped front and break out of the poles first ( steinmetz & hflich 1992 ) .",
    "the interaction of this prolate shock with the oblate density stratification in the star causes a second shock wave that moves from the poles to the equator .",
    "the resulting transport of energy and momentum subsequently produces a quasihomologous outflow having an oblate outer and prolate inner density stratification . in their simulations ,",
    "steinmetz & hflich tracked the evolution of the observed polarization from the electron - scattering photosphere , predicting a relatively high continuum polarization at early times , while the photosphere is in the outer envelope ( @xmath1581.5% during the first 10 days ) , followed by a rotation in @xmath28 and diminishing @xmath1 as the photosphere passes into the respective prolate and spherically stratified layers of the interior .",
    "although the detailed outcome depends on the stellar radius , detailed density profile , rotation ( differential versus rigid ) , and inclination angle , the basic predictions of the above simulations appear to be more or less consistent with the polarized continuum evolution of sn2011dh , and thus might provide some general insight .",
    "the future construction of similar hydrodynamic models of shock propagation in rotating and/or deformed ysgs could help put the hypothesis of a connection between progenitor deformity and sniib explosion geometry on a more quantitative footing , leading to more specific predictions for how particular spectropolarimetric observables and their associated timescales can constrain the physical properties of sneiib and their progenitors .",
    "recent calculations by matzner et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have demonstrated how nonradial fluid motions generated by aspherical core collapse can dramatically alter the dynamics and emission of the emergent shock .",
    "depending on the degree of asphericity , the shock front can develop an oblique orientation with respect to the stellar surface over a significant fraction of the star . the subsequent outflow from regions crossed and energised by this shock becomes unsteady , potentially stifling the intensity and duration of the breakout flash , limiting ejecta speeds , and casting matter sideways .",
    "collisions of matter outside the star might also occur and significantly influence the observational features of the resulting transient .",
    "matzner et al . ( 2013 ) discussed sn2011dh in the context of oblique shock breakout , and suggested that the resulting asphericity of the highest - velocity ejecta might explain why the early - time luminosity and radio emission indicated a compact progenitor ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2012 ) , even though post - explosion images clearly showed that the sn stemmed from an extended ysg ( van dyk et al .",
    "2013 ) ; the reason for the discrepancy lies in the unrealistic assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "interestingly , oblique shock breakout in sn2011dh might also explain why the sn exhibited the strongest continuum polarization during the earliest stages , since the photosphere was in the outer envelope of the quasihomologous flow where velocities are highest .",
    "this possibility motivates the construction of hydrodynamic models that will yield information on the aspherical explosion geometries that stem from oblique shock breakout , enabling the further development of radiative transfer and scattering models that will predict the polarization evolution for such a scenario .",
    "net continuum polarization from a nonaxisymmetric photospheric configuration could also result from an aspherical distribution of radioactive heating and ionization .",
    "for many other cc  sne , clumps or jet - like configurations of @xmath3ni rising rapidly from the core have been invoked to explain their spectropolarimetric properties at various phases ( chugai 1992 ; leonard et al .",

    "2013 ) .",
    "the hypothesis of aspherical radioactive heating is well motivated ; indeed , modern three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic models of cc explosions have shown that relatively small convective asymmetries initiated by fast - rising plumes of neutrino - heated matter in the core can , within hours , grow into large - scale asymmetries in the heavy - element distribution of the outflow ( hammer et al .",
    "2010 ; wongwathanarat et al .",
    "models for both red and blue supergiant progenitors with @xmath159 h envelopes produce @xmath3ni plumes that mix out to velocities up to 30005000kms@xmath16 in the homologous flow ( hammer et al .",
    "more relevantly , 2d hydrodynamic models of sneiib with h envelopes that are several orders of magnitude less massive indicate that bubbles or plumes of @xmath3ni could mix farther out to 6500kms@xmath16 ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , near the h / he interface ( one might expect the mixing to extend to even larger radii in future 3d models of sneiib , if the relative velocity predictions from the aforementioned 2d and 3d models of h - rich cc  sne are mirrored in sneiib ) .     and @xmath28 for h@xmath2 from days 30 and 36 .",

    "radioactive plumes will be encased in cocoons of enhanced free - electron density and excess thomson scattering ( e.g. , see chugai et al .",
    "if the cocoons extend into the h layer , they could produce an irregular or mottled photospheric geometry at early times , thus contributing to the net continuum polarization ( e.g. , on days 9 and 14 ) . depending the projected position of a given plume relative to the global underlying photosphere , the local polarization integrated over the plumes spheroidal surface could effectively cancel out , having essentially the same effect as a photosphere that is partially obscured by line absorption .",
    "this interpretation potentially explains the rough alignment between the position angle of the early day-9 continuum axis and that of h and hei line polarization on days 3036 , which is further illustrated by figure[fig : evol_ha_he ] . in this scenario",
    ", we suggest that the same spheroidal plumes that generate locally enhanced thomson scattering at early times ( and where the integrated polarization locally cancels out because of the spherical pattern on the plume ) later become plumes of relatively high line optical depth for h@xmath2 and hei absorption , since the enhanced electron density in those regions also helps to populate the upper atomic levels of the transitions ( e.g. , lucy 1991 ; fassia et al . 1998 ; chugai 1992 , 2006 ; chugai et al .",
    "2005 ; swartz et al .",
    "1993 ; hflich , khokhlov , & wang 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the plumes at early times will break the symmetry of the global photosphere in a geometric configuration that is similar to symmetry breaking by line absorption at later times , in both cases producing net polarization with similar position angles .",
    "of course , the construction of detailed 3d scattering models that account for the geometries discussed above are needed to put this hypothesis on a more quantitative footing .",
    "an aspherical distribution of plumes in the ejecta might also explain the knee feature on the red sides of the hei @xmath795876 and h@xmath2 emission profiles observed on day 30 and later , which could be an imprint of line emission from such structures on the receding hemisphere of the explosion , but just outside the limb of the projected photosphere on the sky .",
    "interestingly , similar morphology was seen in the h@xmath2 line of sn1987a on day 71 , interpreted as the imprint of clumpy ejecta on the receding hemisphere of the explosion ( chugai 1992 ) . in that case , moreover , thomson scattering of photospheric radiation by radioactive plumes on the receding hemisphere of the explosion was successfully modeled as the source of polarization in sn1987a .",
    "figure[fig : cartoon ] illustrates a configuration that potentially explains the morphology of the polarized line profiles in the quasihomologous outflow .",
    "homology implies that an imaginary plane intersecting the flow perpendicular to our line of sight ( in the plane of the sky ) will sample a region of constant rv over that entire plane ; we refer to these imaginary cross sections as  isovelocity planes . \"",
    "the peak rv of line polarization is a useful indication of the depth of patchy absorption by clumps in the quasihomologous flow , and can be used to probe the relative geometries of atomic species at various radii ( kasen et al .",
    "for example , the fastest outermost isovelocity planes with rv @xmath160kms@xmath16 intersect patches of high - velocity ejecta in the outermost regions of the flow , possibly consisting of clumps from the progenitor star s wind swept up and accelerated by the explosion .",
    "these patches partially obscure the polarized photosphere and produce enhanced polarization at those corresponding rv values .",
    "deeper in the homologous flow , isovelocity planes with rv @xmath161kms@xmath16 intersect a relatively smooth or tenuous region in the thin h envelope that obscures the photosphere evenly or weakly and thus produces no net polarization ( creating the steep drop and local minimum of the polarized profile near this value of rv ) .",
    "deeper isovelocity planes with rv @xmath162kms@xmath16 intersect the clumpy region produced by the @xmath3ni plumes , creating the peak of the polarized h@xmath2 and hei line profiles at this rv .",
    "as illustrated by figure[fig : polvel_rad ] , h@xmath2 and caii absorption on day 9 exhibit the highest maximum rv observed in sn2011dh . at this time , the emission peaks of both lines have relatively high blueshifted velocities of 20003000kms@xmath16 , with h@xmath2 moving back toward rest velocity by day 14 ( note that the wavelength range of the day-14 data does not sample caii ) . such early blueshifts are a common feature of sneii ; the phenomenon has been attributed to the steep density profile of the outflow , which results in highly localised emission regions and exacerbates obscuration of the receding hemisphere of the explosion , resulting in a net blueshift of emission peaks during the first month or so ( e.g. , see anderson et al . 2014 , and references therein ) ; the relatively low - h envelope masses in sneiib might explain why the early blueshift lasts for @xmath163 days .",
    "it thus seems plausible that highest - velocity caii in the outermost regions of the flow is , like high - velocity h@xmath2 , part of the progenitor s outer envelope or wind swept up and accelerated by the explosion .",
    "the apparent antisymmetry of the polarized caii absorption feature with respect to the day-9 continuum ( see figures[fig : rsp ] and [ fig : ca_polvel ] ) is consistent with this interpretation , demonstrating that the patchy absorption on day 9 does not share the geometric configuration of the continuum opacity source or the prominent polarized features of h@xmath2 and hei on later days .",
    "meanwhile , the disappearance of the high - velocity absorption components and the shift of emission peaks back toward rest velocity indicates that this separate outer region has become transparent by day 14 .",
    "oi exhibits the lowest rv and a significantly different position angle than the other lines , and thus appears to be the hallmark of core oxygen synthesised by the progenitor star during post - main - sequence evolution .",
    "interestingly , the rv of oi is consistent with the results of modern 3d hydrodynamic simulations of cc explosions , which predict core o to be mixed out to the 40005000kms@xmath16 layers of the homologous flow ( hammer , janka , & mller 2010 ) .",
    "moreover , the different position angle indicates that the inferred clumpiness of oi could have a different physical origin than that of h@xmath2 and hei , perhaps arising from fluid instabilities deeper in the outflow .",
    "for sneiib with low - mass h envelopes , large - scale rt instabilities are unable to develop at the h / he interface , since there is an insufficient overlying mass to facilitate their growth .",
    "rt structure is , however , expected to develop at the deeper he / c@xmath115o interface ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1997 ) , and thus might be another potential source of patchy oi absorption .",
    "another possibility that should be considered for producing continuum polarization is scattering of sn photons by csm .",
    "if the csm is sufficiently dense , strong interaction will give rise to an additional vector component of thomson scattering near the interface of the sn shock and csm ( hoffman et al .",
    "2008 ; mauerhan et al 2014 ) ; in the case of dense csm , however , one might expect the total - flux spectrum to develop narrow emission - line profiles from csm that becomes photoionized by the uv / x - ray emission at the shock / csm interface ( i.e. , this should produce a sniin spectrum ) .",
    "no such narrow lines were seen in our flux spectra of sn2011dh on day 9 , or in spectra from others obtained as early as day 4 ( marion et al .",
    "2014 ) , so thomson scattering from dense ionized csm seems to be an unlikely alternative for producing an aspherical electron - scattering pseudophotosphere during the first month of our spectropolarimetric data",
    ". however , thomson scattering from csm interaction can not be ruled for the earliest phases of sn2011dh , where spectropolarimetric data are not available .",
    "indeed , the very early radio and millimeter detection of sn2011dh just 3 days post explosion indicates substantial interaction between the sn shock the extended stellar wind of the progenitor ( horesh et al .",
    "recent  flash spectroscopy \" of other cc  sne , from just several days to as early as hours after explosion , have indeed exhibited evidence for short - lived csm interaction and thomson scattering via lorentzian emission - line profiles ( e.g. , gal - yam et al .",
    "2014 ; shivvers et al . 2015 ; smith et al .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that sn2011dh produced a detectable spectropolarimetric signal from csm interaction before our earliest day-9 data .",
    "alternatively , small particles of dust in csm could result in rayleigh scattering of the optical sn photons ( i.e. , a  light echo \" effect ; chevalier 1986 ) , which will linearly polarize a substantial fraction of the reflected light .",
    "as argued by wang & wheeler ( 1996 ) in the case of sn1987a , if the dust sublimation timescale is longer than the duration of the uv flash from the sn , small surviving grains can produce an effective medium for optical scattering .",
    "this was considered to be a very likely explanation for the strong continuum polarization detected from sn1993j ( hflich et al . 1996 ; tran et al .",
    "1997 ) . as mentioned above , early radio and millimeter observations of sn2011dh provided direct evidence for csm from the progenitor wind ( horesh et al .",
    "2013 ) , while late - time x - ray emission roughly 500 days after explosion indicated the presence of dense csm at @xmath164 cm ( maeda et al .",
    "2014 ) , also consistent with a steady - state ysg wind .",
    "the corresponding light travel time across this radius is @xmath165 days .",
    "therefore , continuum polarization via optical scattering is plausible for the first month of sn2011dh if enough dust grains in the wind survived the uv flash of the sn .",
    "however , in this case the apparent drop in the continuum polarization near the spectral transition from h - rich to he - rich would have to be a simple coincidence unrelated to the photospheric evolution .    a potential factor that could help distinguish between rayleigh scattering by small dust particles and",
    "thomson scattering by free electrons is the wavelength dependence of @xmath1 for the former case , owing to the wavelength dependence of the rayleigh scattering phase function . for thomson scattering ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath1 is wavelength independent",
    ". a rayleigh continuum component , if present , will be most prominent at wavelengths @xmath166 .",
    "the day 14 data from bok / spol provide coverage in the range 40004500 , where the average polarization is @xmath167 , nearly null and substantially lower than the continuum level at this epoch .",
    "this appears to be inconsistent with rayleigh scattering by dusty csm .",
    "instead , the observed characteristics seem consistent with the  depolarizing \" effect of line blanketing in this region of the spectrum by material above the thomson - scattering photosphere .",
    "we therefore conclude that the day 914 continuum polarization probably does not include substantial contribution from rayleigh scattering by dusty csm .      despite their relatively low rates among cc explosions",
    ", sneiib are becoming relatively well represented in terms of objects for which there is high - quality spectropolarimetry .",
    "although thorough temporal sampling is often not obtained , the growing sample is beginning to facilitate a search for systematic spectropolarimetric trends that might point to common physical scenarios for sneiib and other classes of sne as well .",
    "figure[fig : compare93j ] compares the total - flux spectra and polarization of the eiib sne2011dh ( day 30 ) and 1993j ( day 33 ; tran et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the ciib sne2001ig ( day 31 ; maund et al .",
    "2007a ) and the ib@xmath12iib transitional sn2008ax ( day 14 ; chornock et al . 2011 ) , all near phases where hei has recently become prominent in the spectrum .",
    "sn2011dh and sn1993j exhibit the maxima of their enhanced h@xmath2 and hei line polarizations at the same wavelengths and , hence , the same velocities , while sn1993j exhibits slightly stronger values of polarization for h@xmath2 and substantially stronger polarization for hei .",
    "relatively strong continuum polarization is also evident for sn1993j in several regions of the spectrum , while the continuum polarization of sn2011dh and sn2008ax has diminished before the phases represented in figure[fig : compare93j ] , but has yet to rise in the case of sn2001ig ( see maund et al .",
    "sn2008ax stands out as having much stronger peak and higher rv h@xmath2 polarization than the others , by a large margin .",
    "the conjecture that most sneiib exhibit substantial continuum polarization at early phases ( typically near 0.5% ) , relative to the frequent absence of continuum polarization in the early stages of sneii - p , is an interesting trend that could help to reveal important clues about the nature of these explosions and their progenitors . indeed ,",
    "if most sneiib stem from close interacting binary systems , then the imprint of tidal deformation on the continuum polarization ( see  4.1.1 ) might be present in many cases .",
    "tidal effects were suggested for sn1993j to potentially explain its inferred ellipsoidal photosphere ( hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; trammell et al . 1993 ) .",
    "indeed , the progenitor had a radius that was @xmath168 times larger than that of sn2011dh , so the influence of tidal distortion on the spectropolarimetry could potentially be more extreme and longer lasting in that case . for the ciib subset of sne that stem from relatively compact progenitors ( perhaps , stripped - envelope wolf - rayet stars ) , direct tidal stretching of the progenitor envelope might seem less likely , unless the binary separations are relatively small .",
    "if ciib progenitors are relatively fast rotators , however , then the resulting aspherical density profile for the star could also lead to a similar geometric evolution for the sn shock and the subsequent photosphere ( direct tidal deformation by a binary companion , or fast rotation , will both give rise to a steeper density gradient along the polar axis of the star ; see  4.1.1 ) .",
    "interestingly , the transitional ciib sn2008ax exhibited significant continuum polarization on days 6 and 9 ( @xmath169% ) , indicating that the outer envelope was indeed quite aspherical ; rotational deformation thus might be a plausible explanation in this case .",
    "for the separate case of the ciib sn2001ig , however , the evolution from relatively weak continuum polarization during the h - rich phase ( @xmath114% ) to a strong value of @xmath5% after the photosphere passed into the he layer ( maund et al .",
    "2007a ) is behaviour more in line with observations of sneii - p .",
    "alternatively , the effects of aspherical radioactive heating by jets or plumes of @xmath3ni might also explain the commonality of continuum polarization in sneiib .",
    "the earlier appearance of this effect , relative to sneii - p with massive h envelopes , is naturally explained by the relatively low - mass envelopes of sneiib .",
    "furthermore , the apparent connection between the position angles of the early - time continuum , h@xmath2 , and hei line polarizations in sn2011dh , if real , might provide an additional reason to favour this physical scenario ( see  4.1.3 ) .",
    "the same connection was proposed for sn2008ax , but in that case the similarity between the line and continuum position angles was even more obvious ( the system exhibited a higher degree of axisymmetry ) and was shared by the oi line as well ( chornock et al .",
    "the possibility that sn2011dh and sn2008ax are similar in this regard , even though they are members of the different eiib and ciib subclasses , might provide a reason to favour aspherical radioactive heating as the cause of their early - time continuum polarization .",
    "after all , the origin of radioactive plumes is in the core , and they will thus be generated regardless of the envelope mass ( although the envelope can influence their geometric development ) . since line polarization indicates patchy absorption , the comparatively high strength of h@xmath2 polarization in sn2008ax could be related to the compactness and relatively thin h envelope of the progenitor , whereby plumes of @xmath3ni from the core might retain their jet - like morphology with less overlying mass to decelerate and mix them , giving rise to the higher degree of axisymmetry .",
    "alternatively , the relatively fast radial velocities of line polarization in sn2008ax might also imply that a @xmath3ni plume or jet was more highly aligned with our line of sight and thus preferentially obscured the more forward - scattered ( less polarized ) photons near the apparent centre of the photosphere , giving rise to a higher degree of line polarization .",
    "of course , such viewing - angle effects could potentially blur the evidence for any intrinsic geometric similarities that sneiib as a class might share , whether they be tidal deformation effects , aspherical plumes of radioactive @xmath3ni , or something else ( e.g. , the potential effect of oblique shock breakout discussed in  4.1.2 ) .    comparison of different sneiib is further complicated by the potential presence of an additional component of continuum polarization from scattering of optical photons from dust in pre - existing csm .",
    "indeed , sn1993j exhibited a relatively large uv excess on day 19 , attributable to a substantial amount of csm , while sn2011dh exhibited insignificant uv excess at a similar phase ( ben - ami et al .",
    "2015 ) . scattering by dust",
    "might thus be the most plausible explanation for the relatively large and long - lasting continuum polarization in sn1993j , a possibility that was discussed previously by hflich et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and tran et al .",
    "the more recent sn2013df also appears to have had a substantial uv excess from csm ( ben - ami et al .",
    "2015 ) , and it will be interesting to see whether the spectropolarimetric data of that event share any noteworthy similarities or differences with sn1993j and sn2011dh that might be attributable to different amounts of csm in each case .",
    "if hypothetically added to sn2011dh , another component of continuum polarization from dust scattering could have potentially wiped out the approximate symmetry between the position angles of the continuum polarization at early times and line polarization at later times .",
    "complementary uv data could thus provide important constraints for the interpretation of spectropolarimetry , helping one to anticipate the potential effects of csm dust .",
    "the scenario of an aspherical sniib explosion influenced by jets or plumes of enhanced radioactive heating is consistent with the detailed structure of the cas  a supernova remnant ( snr ) and the explosion itself .",
    "spectra of cas  a light echoes have unambiguously shown that this was a sniib ( krause et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the substantial differences in the line strength and velocity from multiple echoes that mirrored the sn from different viewing angles is direct evidence for an aspherical explosion ( rest et al .",
    "interestingly , the snr also exhibits a highly aspherical distribution of o and fe knots , which are thought to have been produced by jets or plumes of radioactive @xmath3ni that penetrated the outer layers of the sn at early times , or from the growth of rt instabilities ( milisavljevic & fesen 2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "in addition to our spectropolarimetry , the strong multi - peaked [ oi ] emission detected from sn2011dh at late times by shivvers et al .",
    "( 2013 ) provides independent evidence that an aspherical o - rich snr like cas  a could be developing .",
    "chornock et al . (",
    "2011 ) drew similar parallels between cas  a and sn2008ax .",
    "we present seven epochs of spectropolarimetry of the type iib sn2011dh in m51 .",
    "the observations cover 86 days of evolution , from the early h - rich stage through the nebular phase .",
    "this represents the most complete spectropolarimetric coverage obtained for a sniib since sn1993j .",
    "the late - phase polarization at the central wavelengths of nebular features and the @xmath42@xmath43 loops of caii ir lines at all phases indicate a low value of total isp ( @xmath81% ) , and we have thus made no attempt to remove it from the data . at each epoch , considerable enhanced polarization is detected across line features , while substantial continuum polarization is firmly detected on days 9 and 14 .",
    "several physical scenarios could potentially explain the spectropolarimetric evolution , summarised as follows .",
    "the global asphericity of the early - time photosphere inferred from the continuum polarization could be the imprint of tidal deformation of the ysg progenitor by the purported massive companion ; this hypothesis is facilitated by the recent detection of a hot star at the explosion site by folatelli et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , while substantial geometric deformation of the progenitor envelope is consistent with physical parameters of the binary suggested by benvenuto et al .",
    "this hypothesis does not , however , provide a clear explanation for the approximate symmetry between the early continuum polarization and the subsequent h@xmath2 and hei line polarization that we observe ( see  4.1.3 ) .",
    "alternatively , the continuum and line polarization could be the imprint of clumpy excitation of the envelope by fast - rising plumes of @xmath3ni from the core .",
    "this interpretation does has the advantage of explaining the apparent symmetry between the early - time continuum polarization and the subsequent h@xmath2 and hei line polarization .",
    "we currently lean toward this scenario ( at least for explaining the line polarization ) , as jets and plumes of @xmath3ni are well motivated by hydrodynamic models ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1997 ; hammer et al .",
    "2010 ; wongwathanarat et al .",
    "2010 ) and have commonly been invoked to explain the spectropolarimetric and nebular - phase data of other cc  sne , and in the interpretation of detailed structure in the cas  a snr .    for oi polarization ,",
    "the independent geometry and kinematics suggest that the inferred clumpiness of the absorption could be the result of rt fluid instabilities that develop near the he / c@xmath115o interface , which is consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic models of sneiib ( iwamoto et al .",
    "for caii ir polarization , the independent geometry and relatively high - rv edge of the polarized line profile at early times potentially suggests an origin in the outermost regions of the outflow , perhaps in the clumpy swept - up wind of the progenitor .",
    "another potential explanation for the early - time continuum polarization is optical scattering of sn photons by dusty csm .",
    "indeed , the presence of extended csm is indicated by x - ray observations of sn2011dh out to day @xmath170 , consistent with ongoing interaction between the reverse shock and csm produced by a steady - state progenitor wind ( maeda et al .",
    "however , if dust scattering is responsible for the continuum polarization , then it is puzzling why sn2011dh has such a meager uv excess compared with sn1993j ( ben - ami et al .",
    "2015 ) , since a mass of csm capable of scattering the radiation and producing strong continuum polarization should have produced a non - negligible uv excess .",
    "furthermore , the fact that our shortest - wavelength coverage of the polarization on days 14 and 58 does not exhibit an systematic increase in the magnitude of polarization appears to be inconsistent with scattering of sn photons off of dusty csm .",
    "such scattering by dust could have been mitigated if grains in the csm were effectively destroyed by the radiation from the sn during the early phases of the explosion .",
    "an aspherical explosion stemming from oblique shock breakout is another possible source of continuum polarization in sn2011dh .",
    "theoretical calculations indicate that this phenomenon might be relatively common for stripped - envelope sne ( matzner et al .",
    "2013 ) ; perhaps this could explain the commonality of polarized flux from such sne .",
    "although the above interpretations of the spectropolarimetry are plausible and guided by theoretical models , more sophisticated quantitative analysis is required to further discriminate between them and explore potential combinations of their effects . specifically , the construction of more detailed and robust hydrodynamic and electron - scattering models that account for the geometries we have discussed will enable more accurate interpretations of the emergent polarization .",
    "sneiib are not as observationally homogeneous as previously thought .",
    "however , some interesting and potentially illuminating patterns appear to be emerging for this class .",
    "the frequent detection of substantial polarization demonstrates that asphericity is common , and thus that the assumption of spherical symmetry is dubious ; this is probably the reason why sn2011dh was classified as a ciib subtype on the basis of its early - time luminosity and radio emission ( arcavi et al .",
    "2011 ) , even though the explosion clearly stemmed from an extended ysg ( van dyk et al .",
    "additional observations of the ciib and eiib subclasses undergoing the transition from h - rich to he - rich phases , and complementary uv data indicating the potential for csm interaction and dust scattering , will be necessary to more firmly establish any systematic trends in their spectropolarimetric properties and to determine the physical reasons for their differences .",
    "as it stands , explosion energetics , radioactive inhomogeneities , the mass and potential deformity of stellar envelope , optical scattering by csm dust , the size and distribution of absorbing clumps relative to the projected photosphere , and viewing - angle effects , are all likely to be important factors in the increasing spectropolarimetric variety of sneiib .",
