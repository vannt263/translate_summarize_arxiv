    "quantum dynamical features , such as collapse and revival oscillations , have also been observed@xcite .",
    "the key innovation in such experiments is the ability to tailor the effective potential experienced by the ion by coupling the center - of - mass motion to the electronic states by external laser pulses .",
    "if more than a single ion is trapped , individual ions may be addressed by different laser pulses leading to an entanglement of the collective vibrational motion of the ions and their electronic states .",
    "this is the principle behind the suggestion of cirac and zoller @xcite for implementing quantum computation in ion traps .",
    "so far however only a single controlled - not gate , a key component in a quantum computer , has been implemented experimentally @xcite .    despite these heroic experimental achievements , the quantum motion of a single trapped ion",
    "is obviously limited by sources of decoherence .",
    "decoherence arises from random and unknown perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "if these perturbations can not be followed exactly , experiments must average over them .",
    "this leads to an effective irreversible evolution of the trapped ion and a suppression of coherent quantum features through the decay of off - diagonal matrix elements of the density operator in some basis .",

    "we consider one source of decoherence for a single trapped ion due to intensity and phase fluctuations in the exciting laser pulses .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the stochastic processes involved are white noise processes , which enables us to give a simple master equation description of this source of decoherence .",
    "section ii contains a general overview of the kind of system we investigate . in the first subsection we concentrate on intensity fluctuation in the laser , whereas the second subsection is devoted to phase fluctuations .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on the experimental relevance of our results .",
    "a single two - level ion , with mass @xmath0 , tightly bound in a harmonic trap , and laser cooled to the lamb - dicke limit , can be prepared in a variety of states by carefully controlling the effective detuning of external laser fields which couple the vibrational motion and the internal electronic states .",
    "for simplicity we will assume the ion is constrained to move in a single dimension at harmonic frequency @xmath1 .",
    "a reference frequency is provided by the atomic transition frequency @xmath2 .",
    "if the effective laser frequency @xmath3 is tuned below or above this frequency by multiples of the harmonic trap frequency @xmath1 , a variety of effective potentials may be obtained . in the nist experiments",
    "@xcite , two laser fields are used to excite two - photon stimulated raman transitions .",
    "however in this paper we will consider the simplest case of a single classical laser , with wave vector @xmath4 and frequency @xmath3 , where the field is propagating in the same direction in which the ion is constrained to vibrate .    in the interaction picture with the dipole and rotating wave approximation the interaction hamiltonian is@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the effective rabi frequency for this transition , written as a function of time to account for fluctuations resulting from laser intensity fluctuations , @xmath7 represents fluctuations in the laser phase , @xmath8 is the lamb - dicke parameter",
    ", @xmath9 is the detuning between the laser and the electronic states , and @xmath10 are the usual two - level atom transition operators . in order to excite particular transitions , @xmath11 , of the coupled electronic / vibrational spectrum we choose the detuning @xmath12 where @xmath13 are integers . in this paper",
    "we will assume that the amplitude of the ions motion in the direction of the laser field is much less than a wavelength .",
    "in this limit we can expand the interaction hamiltonian to lowest order in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to illustrate the effect of laser fluctuations it will suffice to consider four cases : ( i ) carrier excitation , @xmath15 , ( ii ) first red sideband excitation @xmath16 , ( iii ) first blue sideband , @xmath17 , ( iv ) second red sideband , @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonians for these four cases are : @xmath19\\ \\ \\ \\mbox{carrier } \\,\\",

    "\\label{randomham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the red sideband hamiltonian corresponds to the familiar jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite of quantum optics .",
    "we will specify the noise by defining a stochastic process for @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the case of laser amplitude fluctuations",
    "we take @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the increment of a real wiener process@xcite , and @xmath22 is the non - fluctuating component of the rabi frequency .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 scales the noise .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath23 is given by integrating eq.([amplitude ] ) to obtain the pulse area , @xmath24 , which is also a stochastic variable , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the pulse duration .",
    "the last term in this equation is a gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance @xmath27 . if we then consider the ratio of the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations in the pulse area to the deterministic pulse area we find @xmath28 for phase fluctuations we take a simple diffusion , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the wiener process .      the hamiltonians in eqs .",
    "( [ randomham ] ) are stochastic .",
    "we first consider the effect of laser intensity fluctuations and ignore phase fluctuations .",
    "we thus set @xmath31 ( constant ) . to obtain the corresponding schrdinger equation",
    "requires some care , as the white noise process is quite singular .",
    "we can however define a stochastic schrdinger equation in the ito formalism@xcite , or more appropriately a stochastic liouville - von neumann equation , @xmath32dt - i\\sqrt{\\gamma}[g,\\rho]dw(t ) -\\frac{\\gamma}{2}[g,[g,\\rho]]dt\\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 takes one of the four forms , @xmath34 this equation gives the evolution of the system density operator conditioned on a particular noise history . in an experiment involving a number of pulses , with data from each pulse combined ,",

    "\\label{mastereq}\\ ] ] this equation has a similar form to that considered in reference @xcite for a model of intrinsic decoherence . indeed , that model of intrinsic decoherence has been explicitly solved for the case of the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian ( the red side - band case ) by moya - cessa _ et al._@xcite ( see also @xcite ) . _",
    "_    the last term in eq.([mastereq ] ) is responsible for decoherence and , complementary to decoherence , it leads to diffusive growth in observables that do not commute with @xmath33 , which is proportional to the interaction hamiltonian of the system . in each case , the eigenstates of @xmath33 are discrete and labeled by an index @xmath35 corresponding to a vibrational quantum number , and a sign index @xmath36 arising from the two dimensional hilbert space of the electronic motion .",
    "we will designate these states as @xmath37 .",
    "thus @xmath38\\langle e_n^\\pm|\\rho(t)|e_m^\\pm\\rangle \\,\\ , .   \\label{energyme}\\ ] ] in this form the decay of off - diagonal coherence is quite explicit .",
    "notice however that decoherence takes place in a joint basis of both the electronic and vibrational hilbert spaces .",
    "this is in contrast to many similar proposals for decoherence , such as brownian motion , which only involve a single hilbert space .",
    "furthermore , the form of the decoherence ensures that total energy is conserved even in the presence of noise , as expected for a stochastic hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates and eigenvalues for each of the operators in eqs.(11 - 13 ) are as follows . for the case of carrier excitation : @xmath39 for the case of red side - band excitation ( jaynes - cummings ) : @xmath40 for the blue side - band case : @xmath41 for the second red sideband case : @xmath42    the general solution to eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) may be written explicitly as @xmath43 where the superoperator in the middle of this expression is defined by the power series expansion for the exponential with @xmath44 in the energy eigenstate basis we can solve eq.([energyme ] ) explicitly to give @xmath45\\langle e_n^\\pm|\\rho(0 )    the solution explicitly for particular initial conditions of relevance to the experiments . with this in mind",
    "we will assume that the initial state is prepared to be a particular vibrational energy eigenstate with the ion prepared in the electronic ground state , @xmath46 in the experiments done so far , it is possible to probe directly which electronic state the ion occupies . in the work of meekhof et al .",
    "@xcite the internal state @xmath47 is the @xmath48 @xmath49 ) state of @xmath50be@xmath51 , and the state @xmath52 corresponds to the @xmath48 ( @xmath53 ) state as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the state @xmath47 is detected by applying a nearly resonant @xmath54 polarized laser probe field to drive a strong transition between the state @xmath47 and another state , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "as this other state can only decay back to @xmath47 , any fluorescence observed on this transition is evidence that the atom was in the state @xmath47 at the start of this probe pulse . as the intensity of the fluorescence on this transition is strong , it is almost certain to detect a photon and thus the quantum efficiency of this state determination is near unity . in other words ,",
    "this measurement scheme realizes an almost perfect projection valued measurement onto the electronic state @xmath47 .",
    "a sequence of probe pulses delayed a time @xmath57 after the initial state preparation can thus be used to build up the probability @xmath58 to find the ion in the ground state .",
    "of course to do this many repeats of the experiment must be performed and it is not possible to track laser fluctuations exactly one each run . the final result for @xmath58 must then represent an ensemble average over these fluctuations , and the ion dynamics is then described by eq.([mastereq ] ) . given @xmath58 ,",
    "one easily sees that @xmath59 .    with @xmath60 ,",
    "the solution for @xmath58 in each case is as follows . for carrier excitation : @xmath61 \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] for red side - band excitation : @xmath62 \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] for blue sideband excitation ; @xmath63 \\,\\ , .   \\label{bluesideband}\\ ] ] for second red sideband excitation : @xmath64 \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] so to test the dependence of decoherence on the excitation in the vibrational state experimentally , the second red sideband ( or any higher order sideband ) is a better choice than just the first order sidebands , since the dependence of the damping on @xmath35 is quadratic ( or of even higher order for higher sidebands ) . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we illustrate a typical result using eq .",
    "( [ bluesideband ] ) and the parameters given in @xcite .",
    "now we investigate phase fluctuation in the laser instead of intensity fluctuations , i.e. we set @xmath6 in eqs .",
    "( [ randomham1])([randomham ] ) to @xmath22 and introduce white phase noise @xmath65 instead .",
    "the means that the hamiltonian is a nonlinear function of the noise which will lead to technical difficulties in deriving the corresponding ito differential equation for the system state .",
    "however for our purposes a simple transformation can simplify matters considerably .",
    "we follow @xcite and use a random canonical transformation to get rid of the nonlinearity in the noise source . in effect",
    "this is an instantaneous rotation of the system through a fluctuating angle , analogous to the standard method of transformation to an interaction picture . @xmath66",
    "thus @xmath67 where @xmath33 is one of the operators defined by eqs .",
    "( [ ggg1])([ggg ] ) , depending on which sideband the laser is tuned to .",
    "the reason we can use this stochastic transformation is that we are only interested in the population of the electronic levels . as the generator of the unitary transformation commutes with the population operator ,",
    "the populations in the instantaneous transformed frame are the same as those in the original frame .",
    "however other moments will not be the same , and we could not easily use the transformed state , @xmath68 , after averaging , to reconstruct moments in the original frame .",
    "this transformation can be described covering all four cases of @xmath33 in one , since it only affects the internal state and the operators describing that ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 appear in the same order and form in all the interactions we consider here ) .",
    "the corresponding master equation after averaging out the noise reads @xmath71   - \\lambda \\left [ \\hat{\\sigma}_+ \\hat{\\sigma}_- ,   \\left [ \\hat{\\sigma}_+ \\hat{\\sigma}_- ,   \\tilde{\\rho } \\right ] \\right ] \\,\\ , .\\ ] ] for the initial condition @xmath72 \\,\\ , ( \\mbox{red sideband } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath73 so here the effective rabi frequency depends on the coherence decay rate and not vice versa as in the case of intensity fluctuations .",
    "we have shown how to model fluctuations in the laser causing the interaction between center - of - mass motion and internal states in ion traps .",
    "intensity fluctuations lead to decoherence processes which depend on the kind of interaction the laser is causing .    what is the value for @xmath23 for fluctuations in the laser intensity ?",
    "a rough estimate from the figures given in @xcite , using the quoted experimental values , leads to @xmath74 . but",
    "this is really a very rough estimation . if we define the fractional error by the quotient of the r.m.s . and the pulse area , @xmath75 a fractional error of one percent leads to @xmath76 .",
    "with a fractional error of ten percent , however , we get @xmath77 and we are in the range of the roughly estimated value for @xmath23 .    in @xcite",
    "they experimentally estimate the @xmath35-dependence of their damping which they fit with @xmath78\\ ] ] to be of the form @xmath79 we derive the coefficient to be 0.5 instead of 0.7 if the decoherence is just due to intensity fluctuations alone .",
    "however there are other sources of decoherence due , for example , to fluctuations in the trap potential itself .",
    "these fluctuations lead to , among other things , a fluctuating trap center point and will be addressed in a future publication .",
