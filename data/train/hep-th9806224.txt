    "in most cases the curves given by the toda - system have genus much higher than the rank of the group  only for su(@xmath23 ) with lax - matrix in the fundamental representation do they agree .",
    "so in addition to finding the differential @xmath24 , one needs to choose rank@xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27-cycles and thus pick out the physically relevant rank@xmath25-dimensional subvariety of the jacobian @xcite .",
    "this sub - variety is called the preferred prym .",
    "it is the same for all curves that correspond to the same gauge group , regardless of the representation of the lax - matrix . also , the curves have natural weyl group actions acting on them .",
    "this induces symmetries on the cycles and differentials and therefore on the jacobian .",
    "the preferred prym variety is then the part of the jacobian which corresponds to the reflection representation of the weyl group .    for most gauge groups it is possible to find explicitly",
    "a genus @xmath28 curve for which the jacobian is just the prym variety .",
    "these curves are obtained from the original ones as quotients by certain symmetries , see for example @xcite for explicit constructions .",
    "the physics of the @xmath0 sw gauge theory for the quotient curve is the same as the for the original curve .",
    "it is natural to assume that the ten - dimensional brane picture should inherit the symmetries of the curve we wrap the m5-brane on .",
    "because the symmetries originate from the weyl group action we should see that action on the brane diagram . for su(@xmath23 )",
    "this does not give us anything new : the curve already has genus @xmath28 and the weyl group acts by permuting the d4-branes .",
    "but for other gauge groups we can use this to determine what the brane configuration should be .",
    "the curves of orthogonal and symplectic groups have only @xmath29 symmetries .",
    "the so(@xmath1 ) and sp(@xmath1 ) curves ( [ curves ] ) are both invariant under the involutions @xmath30 sp(@xmath1 ) has also an additional symmetry @xmath31 so(@xmath32 ) curve on the other hand is left invariant only under @xmath33 and the combination @xmath34 . if we rescale @xmath6 by @xmath35\\ ] ] we see that @xmath33 corresponds to @xmath36 and @xmath37 to a shift in @xmath38 coordinate : @xmath39 .",
    "these symmetries can be implemented to the ten dimensional brane diagrams by adding an orientifold @xcite .",
    "there are two possibilities : either an o4-plane acting on the coordinates as @xmath40 or an o6-plane @xmath41 the action of the o6 in the @xmath15 and @xmath42 coordinates is exactly the combined symmetry @xmath43 , whereas the o4 acts only as @xmath44 . with only two ns5-branes",
    "there is not much difference whether we will us an o4 or an o6 , but with more then two ns5-branes there are problems associated to the charge of the o4  it should change sign whenever the orientifold passes a five - brane @xcite .",
    "moreover , if we require that the orientifold projection should be equivalent to taking the quotient with respect to all the symmetries of the curve we find that the o6 is more natural .",
    "the reason why the o6 symmetries are related to the symmetries of the curves becomes more clear when we look at their eleven dimensional origin  they are certain types of singularities in m - theory @xcite .",
    "away from the singularity the complex structure of these spaces can be given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the rr - charge of the orientifold and @xmath47 the parameter that sets the gauge theory scale : @xmath48 ; @xmath49 .",
    "when the charge @xmath46 is negative ( [ ah - space ] ) describes a complex structure of the atiyah - hitchin space .",
    "the interpretation for the positive charge is less clear .",
    "recall that adding to the gauge theory hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation corresponds to modifying the singularity structure by introducing @xmath50-branes : @xmath51 thus the positively charged o6 resembles @xmath52 d6-branes stuck in the origin , but with a singularity that can not be resolved .",
    "the gauge theory curves of classical groups can now be described by the following equations : @xmath53 after using ( [ ah - space ] ) to solve for @xmath54 and defining @xmath55 we get the curves listed in ( [ curves ] ) .",
    "note that here the so(@xmath32 ) curve is symmetric under @xmath56 , only the scaling of @xmath57 changes that . also , the charge of the orientifold is not absolutely determined . for so(@xmath32 ) we could as well have written @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the brane diagram for so(@xmath1 ) is easily determined . as we have seen , the symmetries of the curve are exactly those of o6 .",
    "the ten dimensional configuration of branes consists of two ns5-branes , an orientifold six - plane in the origin and @xmath1 d4-branes symmetrically on each side of @xmath7-axis .",
    "in addition , we see from figure [ so4fig ] that the ns5-branes extend to infinity in the @xmath60 due to bending caused by the orientifold . those can be interpreted as two semi - infinite d4-branes on each side , located at @xmath61 .",
    "the o6-plane effectively mods out all the symmetries , leaving only the physically significant part . in the original curve @xmath62 this",
    "amounts to defining new variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 , giving the genus @xmath28 surface where the prym lives : @xmath65 note that we can not wrap the m - theory five - brane directly on this reduced curve and still get the same world volume gauge theory .",
    "the reason is that to get the correct gauge group we need the orientifold to project out part of the chan - paton factors .",
    "the so(@xmath32 ) is a bit more complicated .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , there are two equivalent descriptions : one with o6 of charge @xmath66 and @xmath67 and the other with a charge 4 orientifold and slightly different polynomial @xmath68 .",
    "the former would describe a brane diagram with one semi - infinite d4-brane on each side of the five - branes at @xmath69 and nothing between them .",
    "the latter has also an extra d4-brane sitting on top of the orientifold , extending all the way to plus and minus infinity .",
    "so effectively this is the same as the so(@xmath1 ) configuration but with one d4 in the origin @xmath69 , between the five - branes , making it a total of @xmath32 d4-branes .",
    "this is the configuration suggested also in @xcite . in both cases , as for so(@xmath1 ) , the semi - infinite branes do not represent matter but are a result of the bending of the m5-brane in the presence of the orientifold .",
    "the genus @xmath28 quotient curve is very similar to that of so(@xmath1 ) : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath64 .",
    "the sp(@xmath1 ) curve differs from the curves of all other classical groups in that it is of fourth order in @xmath6 , meaning that we should have a brane configuration with four ns5-branes .",
    "however , looking at the symmetries of and restricting to the physically significant part we can argue that only two ns5-branes are needed in ten dimensions .",
    "recall that the curve had an additional symmetry @xmath72 . because this leaves the curve intact the effective period of @xmath73 is @xmath74 .",
    "therefore instead of @xmath6 we should use @xmath75 as the variable of the curve .",
    "this gives @xmath76 where the remaining symmetries @xmath44 and @xmath33 can be realized as the action of an o6 .",
    "taking the quotient with respect to these gives the genus @xmath28 curve : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "this curve is hyperelliptic , unlike the one we started from .    solving the sp(@xmath1 ) curve ( [ curves ] ) for @xmath79",
    "we get , @xmath80 .\\ ] ] the point at @xmath69 is not a branch point . even though there is only one solution at that point , @xmath81 , going around it does not produce a jump in the phase .",
    "this implies that there is no wrapping around the @xmath73 direction and therefore no d4-brane . at this point",
    "the curve is singular since @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the two sheets will be connected at @xmath69 but this does not correspond to a dynamical d4-brane but to a singularity of the curve .",
    "but there are still @xmath32 branch cuts .",
    "the one on the middle ( see fig .",
    "[ sp4fig ] ) comes from the factor @xmath83 and will in the @xmath84 limit collapse to a d4-brane stuck in the origin .",
    "this differs from the straightforward interpretation of the zeroes of the polynomials as the positions of the branes , which would give either @xmath85 d4-branes , none of them at the origin , or @xmath1 branes plus two branes on the origin . for the latter case",
    ", however , one needs to take a curve that does not come from the integrable system @xcite .    as for so(@xmath32 ) we could have gotten the two - fold cover curve ( [ newsp ] ) for sp(@xmath1 ) directly from the m - theory curves ( [ m - curves ] ) by choosing a differently charged orientifold @xmath86 and another polynomial @xmath87 .",
    "but then @xmath54 and @xmath57 would scale like @xmath88 and we would need to introduce the term @xmath89 by hand .",
    "therefore we think that the sp(@xmath1 ) curves in m - theory must be of second order in @xmath90 and consequently of fourth order in @xmath6 , but the corresponding ten - dimensional brane diagram can be described with only two ns5-branes .",
    "now we can proceed to wrap the m - theory five brane on the toda curve of exceptional groups and use the techniques developed in the previous sections to investigate what happens in the ten dimensional limit .",
    "we will study g@xmath3 in detail and after that make brief comments on e@xmath4 .",
    "the g@xmath3 curve is @xmath91 ^ 2 + 2 v^2 a_2(v^2)[t+\\mu / t]- v^2 b_6(v^2 ) -12\\mu=0 , \\label{g2curve}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it has genus 11 and it is of fourth order in @xmath6 . unlike for sp(@xmath1 )",
    "there apparently is no symmetry that would allow us to find a two fold cover curve which is equivalent from the ten dimensional point of view . to see this",
    ", we first find the quotient curve @xmath94 that contains the prym variety .",
    "the obvious symmetries of @xmath95 are @xmath44 and @xmath33 in ( [ sigma12 ] ) .",
    "we could obtain a double cover curve by taking the quotient with respect to these , but the resulting curve has genus one  too small to contain the prym .",
    "there is a third symmetry though : @xmath96 .",
    "\\label{sigmag}\\ ] ] therefore , good variables are the ones invariant under the combined action of @xmath44 , @xmath33 and @xmath97 : @xmath98 . \\label{z}\\ ] ] they give a genus two curve @xcite @xmath99 which is hyperelliptic even when the original curve was not with the help of elliptic differential operators is no doubt a signal of this . ] .",
    "this curve is not the same as the hyperelliptic curve proposed for g@xmath3 in @xcite , whose physical validity was later questioned in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be checked that the discriminant of the reduced curve @xmath100 is the same as the quantum discriminant @xmath101 of g@xmath3 field theory calculated in @xcite : @xmath102 it does differ from the discriminant of the original four - fold cover curve @xmath95 @xmath103 by a prefactor , which was argued in @xcite to correspond to an unphysical singularity .    in the previous section we saw that for sp(@xmath1 )",
    "the original spectral curve is also of fourth order in @xmath6 but it has a symmetry @xmath104 which allows us to define @xmath105 .",
    "this is equal to a rescaling of the period of the eleventh coordinate @xmath38 and thus will not show in the ten dimensional brane diagram . clearly , considering the symmetries of the g@xmath3 curve , no scaling of @xmath38 will able us to find a two fold cover equivalent to ( [ g2curve ] ) .",
    "so if we want to construct a brane diagram for this theory it would have to originate from the four fold cover curve @xmath95 and therefore have four ns5-branes .",
    "we are going to investigate whether such a configuration makes sense and if it does not , why . also , we want to understand how it would differ from the brane configurations for product gauge groups .",
    "the branch points of the curve are located at the zeroes of @xmath106 and @xmath107=0 $ ] , which is equivalent to @xmath108=0 .",
    "\\label{pmsqrt}\\ ] ] note that as for sp(@xmath1 ) the @xmath69 is not a branch point but a singularity of the curve .",
    "the two sets of branch points have very different characteristics .",
    "the global behavior of the cuts is a complicated issue .",
    "fortunately , for our purposes it suffices to study some general features .",
    "we now solve ( [ g2curve ] ) for @xmath6 as a function of @xmath15 and label the sheets @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "for any point @xmath111 satisfying @xmath112 we see that @xmath113 and @xmath114",
    ". therefore , for each pair of branch points coming from ( [ shortsqrt ] ) there will be one tube connecting the @xmath115 and @xmath116 sheets and a second tube connecting the @xmath117 and @xmath110 sheets at the same value of @xmath118 , giving a total of eight cuts ( see figure [ coverfig ] ) .",
    "curve as a four fold cover of the @xmath15 plane.,width=377 ]    the branch points satisfying ( [ pmsqrt ] ) give rise to six branch cuts that join either @xmath115 and @xmath110 ( @xmath119 ) or @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "unlike the previous case each cut corresponds to only one tube joining a pair of sheets .",
    "if we identify the cuts with d4-branes we immediately see why this configuration is different from a product group : for product groups the positions of branes between different pairs of ns5-branes are not related .",
    "the d4-branes between the @xmath121 and the @xmath122 ns5-branes are free to move independently of the position of the branes between the @xmath122 and the @xmath123 ns5-brane . for the g@xmath3 four fold cover for any value of the moduli",
    "the branch cuts between @xmath115 and @xmath116 have to be located at the same @xmath124 position as the cuts connecting @xmath117 and @xmath110 .",
    "a similar thing happens for the brane configuration of so(@xmath1 ) with matter in the symmetric representation @xcite , as a result of the orientifold six - plane in the middle .",
    "moreover , because g@xmath3 has only two moduli the positions of @xmath125-cuts depend in some way on the positions of the cuts that originate from @xmath126 .",
    "even classically , if we follow the prescription of identifying the number of branes with zeroes of the polynomials , we run into trouble .",
    "we would obtain a configuration with four ns5-branes , three d4-branes in the outermost columns and eight in the middle one .",
    "seemingly , this describes a theory with @xmath127 gauge group , but the curve only contains two moduli and one scale , @xmath47 , and therefore can not describe a product gauge group .",
    "a serious complication is that not all the cuts collapse to points when we go to ten dimensions , which was the requirement of having a well defined classical ten dimensional limit .",
    "all the cuts coming from the polynomials @xmath128 ( [ pmsqrt ] ) and one cut from ( [ shortsqrt ] ) have the desired behaviour when @xmath84 , but the remaining three cuts do not .",
    "therefore it seems that starting from the curve ( [ g2curve ] ) it is not possible to get a ten dimensional brane configuration with g@xmath3 field theory on the world volume .",
    "if we try to construct a curve such that at least the discriminant would have same zeroes as the discriminant of the g@xmath3 field theory , and also would have a well defined ten dimensional limit we will also encounter problems . for example , consider @xmath129 which amounts to sending the outermost ns5-branes to infinity .",
    "the branch points are at @xmath130 and the discriminant of the curve is @xmath131 .",
    "now the cuts will collapse to points , creating a brane configuration with two ns5-branes and six four branes between them , four semi - infinite d4-branes on each side ( two of them located at @xmath69 ) and an o6 in the middle .",
    "the semi - infinite branes do not generate hypermultiplets since there are no free moduli associated to any of them .",
    "the discriminant is the correct g@xmath3 discriminant , modulo an unphysical factor , but we can not obtain the g@xmath3 prym from it .",
    "the jacobians of the new curve and @xmath95 can not be the the same because there is no way of getting the correct genus two curve from ( [ almostg2 ] ) by taking the quotient with respect to the symmetries  @xmath94 in ( [ g2prym ] ) depends only on the polynomial @xmath132 , not on @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , even if this brane configuration does have some of the characteristics of a g@xmath3 it can not contain all the information needed .",
    "we interpret these findings as an indication that it is not possible to have a weakly coupled type iia brane configuration that will reproduce a g@xmath3 gauge theory .",
    "nevertheless , in the spirit of our previous examples we would like to implement the symmetries directly in m - theory to isolate the physically significant part of the curve .",
    "in order to get the correct gauge groups in the d4 world - volume gauge theory one has to project out part of the chan - paton degrees of freedom . for all other groups we have studied so far",
    "these projections were equivalent to modding out the symmetries of the curve , to find the genus @xmath28 part that contains the prym .",
    "for g@xmath3 the symmetries @xmath44 and @xmath33 can be realized as an o6 , but since this gives a curve with genus one instead of two , it is not enough .",
    "we would need to implement also the new symmetry ( [ sigmag ] ) .",
    "the transformation @xmath97 does square to identity , but it does not admit an interpretation as an orientifold plane in terms of the coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath15 . in order to realize this symmetry",
    "we would need not an orientifold plane but a more complicated object in m - theory , which would live in the invariant locus @xmath133 of the transformation @xmath134 .",
    "this seems to be a kind of curved orientifold surface . after a coordinate transformation to @xmath135 defined in ( [ z ] ) @xmath134 reads @xmath136 , which is the symmetry of an ordinary orientifold plane .",
    "however , after this transformation the o6 plane which corresponds to symmetries @xmath137 will turn into a curved surface .",
    "it would be interesting to see if it is possible to construct a m - theory background , like the atiyah - hitchin space for o6 , that would realize all the symmetries @xmath138 and @xmath134 simultaneously .",
    "the e@xmath4 curve presents many of the characteristics seen in g@xmath3 .",
    "it is a genus 34 curve that can be realized as a four - fold cover of the @xmath15-plane ( [ curves ] ) .",
    "the branch cuts of the curve have the same behavior as in the g@xmath3 case .",
    "namely , they do not collapse to points when compactifying ten dimensions and thus will not describe d4-branes in this limit .",
    "one of our original motivations was to examine the breaking of exceptional groups to get matter in the spinor representation .",
    "it is perfectly possible to take a curve , write the invariants @xmath139 of the bigger group in terms of the moduli of the group that it breaks into ( for explicit construction for @xmath140 see @xcite ) and recover in some limit of the moduli space a new curve which describes a group with a specific matter content .",
    "unfortunately , as we have argued , there is no guarantee that the resulting curve will have a good limit in weakly coupled type iia theory .    for e@xmath4",
    "it is not known if a genus six curve that contains the prym - tjurin @xcite variety can be constructed explicitly .",
    "thus , we can only speculate that even more complicated object than a curved orientifold would be needed in m - theory in order to obtain this subvariety .",
    "we have seen that in the brane configurations for classical groups we can generically identify d4-branes with branch cuts of the seiberg - witten curve @xmath141 .",
    "the need to introduce o6 or o4-planes to the brane configuration can be understood as the symmetries that have to be quotioned out in order to obtain the physically significant curve that has the prym variety as its jacobian .",
    "we found several ways how the g@xmath3 toda curve differs from those of the classical groups .",
    "it does not have a well defined classical ten dimensional limit that would reduce the cuts to d4-branes .",
    "we think it is not possible to find a brane configuration in weakly coupled type iia string theory which would describe a g@xmath3 field theory on the d4 world - volume .",
    "the situation for e@xmath4 is similar and even more complicated .",
    "moreover , the symmetries of the g@xmath3 curve can not be realized as orientifold planes .",
    "instead we would need , in addition to an o6 plane , a curved orientifold surface .",
    "it would be interesting to see if it is possible to construct an m - theory background that would realize all the symmetries of g@xmath3 simultaneously .",
