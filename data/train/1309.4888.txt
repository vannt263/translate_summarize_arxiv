    "the discoveries of space - based photometric missions such as _ kepler _ , _ corot _ and _ most _ have reshaped our understanding of the pulsation of rr lyrae stars .",
    "not long ago , these stars were thought to be fairly simple , with three distinct classes : fundamental - mode , first - overtone and double - mode pulsators , with the only , though serious complicating factor being the blazhko effect .",
    "it turned out , however , that the stars , especially the modulated ones show several dynamic phenomena : period doubling , additional modes and near - resonant states ( szab , in this volume , and references therein ) .",
    "due to their sharpness , light maxima of rr lyrae stars are not well covered by the 29.4 min long - cadence sampling of _ kepler_. therefore we analyzed only those rr lyrae stars which have available short - cadence ( sc ) data .",
    "we searched for regularities and beating patterns in the light curves of all modulated rrab stars and compared them to the frequency content of the data .",
    "beating can be separated from other proposed cycle - to - cycle irregularities ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gillet  2013 ) ) and temporal evolution can be followed with the visual method .",
    "we found four different types of behaviour occurring as an interaction between four different modes : the fundamental ( fm ) , the 1st , 2nd and 9th overtones ( o1 , o2 and pd ) .",
    "the modes labeled o1 and o2 are not necessarily radial modes in all cases but have similar frequency ratios in all stars .",
    "the 9th overtone has been observed only through period doubling when it is in resonance with the fundamental mode .",
    "* fm + pd + o1 ( rr  lyr ) : the beating pattern of rr  lyr is dominated by period doubling but beating with the first overtone sometimes creates quasi - repetitive patterns lasting six pulsation cycles with differing maximum brightnesses ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* molnr et al .  2012 ) ) . *",
    "fm + o1 + pd ( v360  lyr ) : the first overtone has much higher amplitude than period doubling . the fm - o1 frequency ratio is close to 8:11 , resulting in the quasi - repetition of an 8 fm - period long beating pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . * fm + o2 ( v460  lyr ) : in this star only the fm and the 2nd overtone are visible , making it the third known fm / o2 double - mode star .",
    "the frequency ratio is close to 3:5 , leading to a quasi-3-cycle beating pattern . *",
    "fm + o2 + pd ( kic 7257008 ) : the period ratio is the same as above but more complicated patterns are also observable .",
    "the frequency spectrum shows the signs of period doubling as well as peaks around the o1 mode but the latter are in fact @xmath0 combination peaks .",
    "although other stars show more complicated patterns in the cycle - to - cycle amplitude variations that are harder to describe , almost all show similar additional frequencies .",
    "these findings support the mode - interaction model of the blazhko effect ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nowakowski & dziembowski 2001 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* buchler & kollth 2011 ) ) . on the other hand ,",
    "similar cycle - to - cycle irregularities described in the shock - interaction model ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gillet 2013 ) ) most likely arise simply from the combined effect of the beating of the modes and the uncertainties induced by the sparse sampling of the long cadence data instead of stochastic processes .",
