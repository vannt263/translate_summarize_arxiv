    "an elegant and attractive way of solving the hierarchy problem of the standard model is the technicolor paradigm @xcite , for a review and additional references see @xcite .",
    "the basic building block of any technicolor model is a non - abelian gauge theory coupled to some number of fermion flavors transforming in some representation of the gauge group .",
    "the renormalized coupling towards the infrared may run similarly to qcd , may exhibit a walking behavior or may run into a fixed point .",
    "generically , it is possible to realize all three possibilities for a given gauge group by changing the representation and/or flavor number .",
    "if both the gauge group and the representation are fixed the flavor number will determine in which phase the gauge theory is in the infrared .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking is intimately tied to the infrared behavior .",
    "clearly , if chiral symmetry is broken , the theory can not have a non - trivial conformal fixed point . at @xmath1 chiral symmetry",
    "is broken and as @xmath14 is increased at a critical @xmath14 the theory will enter the conformal window .",
    "it is generally believed that the restoration of chiral symmetry will signal the lower edge of the conformal window . strictly speaking this is not necessarily the case because in principle",
    "chiral symmetry can be intact while the theory is not conformal ( for example by generating a dynamical scale not in the chiral condensate but another quantity ) but the general expectation is that this exotic scenario will not take place .    in this work",
    "the 2-index symmetric ( sextet ) representation of @xmath0 is considered in the quenched approximation .",
    "this model with @xmath15 fermions is attractive for phenomenology for several reasons .",
    "first , since the sextet is a complex representation , if chiral symmetry breaking does take place it is expected on general grounds to give rise to 3 goldstone modes which will be eaten appropriately by the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons .",
    "second , the @xmath15 value might not be far from the lower edge of the conformal window and the coupling might exhibit the necessary walking behavior .",
    "third , the perturbative @xmath18-parameter is rather small making it plausible that the model can be made consistent with electro - weak precision data .",
    "the likely smallness of the @xmath18-parameter is a consequence of the fact that the fermion content is increased by increasing the dimension of the representation and not the flavor number @xcite .",
    "all of the above , of course , is only possible if the theory is below the conformal window .",
    "if chiral symmetry breaking does take place , this is clearly the case .",
    "this is our primary motivation for the current study of chiral properties of sextet fermions .",
    "overlap fermions @xcite preserve chiral symmetry exactly and possess exact zero modes at finite lattice spacing .",
    "the zero modes are indicative of the topology of the underlying gauge field while near - zero modes give rise to chiral symmetry breaking via the banks - casher relation @xcite . in the @xmath19-regime random matrix theory ( rmt )",
    "@xcite gives detailed predictions for the statistical properties of non - zero modes .",
    "how well rmt actually describes the non - zero modes of the sextet overlap operator will be addressed in this work at @xmath1 .",
    "our findings for the zero - modes and the associated questions about topology have been reported in @xcite .",
    "a priori it is not known what the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is in an arbitrary representation . on general grounds",
    "one expects the sextet breaking to be the same as for the fundamental representation because both representations are complex .",
    "this expectation is verified here by the observation that the same rmt ensemble , the chiral unitary one , describes both the fundamental and the sextet eigenvalues in each exact zero mode sector @xmath20 .",
    "the number of zero modes depends on the representation and once a gauge configuration is given the number of sextet zero modes is approximately @xmath21 times the number of fundamental zero modes as dictated by the index theorem .",
    "the deviation from this rule is a lattice artifact which becomes less and less for decreasing lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "the rmt predictions are sensitive to @xmath20 and the matching of the simulation to rmt with the correct number of @xmath20 is a highly non - trivial test .",
    "a staggered fermion study necessarily limited to the trivial sector has been reported in @xcite and an overlap study with two different @xmath22 representations and the fundamental of @xmath0 appeared in * ? ? ? * .",
    "previous lattice studies with unusual fermion content include gauge groups @xmath22 and @xmath0 and various representations @xcite which were largely motivated by the same considerations as mentioned here , with some exceptions .",
    "the low lying dirac spectrum is indicative of the infrared properties of the theory",
    ". it will exhibit markedly different behavior if chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken or if the infrared dynamics is conformal . using the dirac spectrum as a tool to decide in which phase a gauge theory is has been suggested first in @xcite and",
    "later this idea was applied in @xcite .",
    "the banks - casher relation in a theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking relates the low end of the spectral dirac density to the chiral condensate , = _",
    "it also implies that the low - lying eigenvalues are dense in the sense that the average spacing is inversely proportional to the volume , [ chideltal ] = .",
    "the low energy dynamics in a finite box of spatial extent @xmath23 is accurately described by chiral perturbation theory if @xmath24 . if in addition the quark mass is chosen such that @xmath25 the derivative terms in the chiral lagrangian can be dropped .",
    "this @xmath19-regime is then analytically calculable in the microscopic limit with the help of rmt which can also be directly derived from the chiral lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the comparison is valid in the microscopic large @xmath23 limit , meaning that the dirac eigenvalues @xmath26 and fermion masses @xmath27 are rescaled , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are kept finite .",
    "hence the comparison is relevant for the small eigenvalues which are @xmath32 .",
    "the rmt description only depends on the rescaled fermion masses , @xmath14 , the number of zero modes @xmath20 and the pattern of symmetry breaking .",
    "since both the fundamental and sextet representations are complex , the symmetry breaking pattern is expected to be the same @xcite .",
    "then the relevant random matrix model is governed by the following partition function , [ rmtz ] z = dw dw^ ( d + m ) ^n_f ( - n w w^ ) , where the complex matrix @xmath16 is @xmath33 and the dirac operator is , d = 0 & iw + iw^ & 0 , assuming degenerate fermion masses @xmath27 . in the microscopic large @xmath34",
    "limit the mass @xmath27 and eigenvalues @xmath26 are rescaled by @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , similarly to the gauge theory case and then @xmath37 . in this limit",
    "the joint distribution of the @xmath38 smallest eigenvalues , @xmath39 , is given by @xcite [ omega ] & & ( _ 1,  ,_k ) = _ k ( -_k^2/4 ) _",
    "i=1^k-1 ( _ i^2 + 1 ( _ i^2+^2)^n_f ) _",
    "i > j^k-1 ( _ i^2 - _",
    "j^2 ) ^2 ^n_f + & & where @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the argument of @xmath42 appear @xmath14 and @xmath20 times , respectively , while @xmath31 appears @xmath14 times in the argument of @xmath43 .",
    "the expression @xmath44 with any number of arguments is given by the ratio , _",
    ",x_m ) = , which has a finite limit if some of the @xmath45 variables become degenerate .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath46 eigenvalue is then , [ pzetak ] p_k(_k ) = _ 0^_k d_1 _ _ 1^_k d_2  _ _ k-2^_k d_k-1 ( _ 1,  ,_k ) .    in order to match the gauge theory calculation onto the rmt prediction , the scale @xmath47 needs to be determined so that the gauge theory eigenvalues can be rescaled appropriately by @xmath48 . in order to have a completely parameter free prediction we will consider the distribution of ratios of eigenvalues .",
    "the unknown scale @xmath47 drops out from these at @xmath1 .",
    "for example the distribution of the ratio of the first and second eigenvalue , @xmath49 , is simply [ p12 ] p_1,2(r ) = _ 0^d_2 ( r _ 2 , _ 2 ) , and can be directly compared with the corresponding distribution in the gauge theory .",
    "similar integrals apply to any ratio @xmath50 .",
    "the universality of the rmt description is twofold .",
    "first , the spectral properties of the matrix model in the large @xmath34 limit do not depend on the details of the matrix model potential , generic perturbations of the latter leave the former unchanged @xcite . in ( [ rmtz ] )",
    "we have chosen the simplest potential , a gaussian .",
    "second , the spectral properties of two different underlying theories is expected to match the same matrix model as long as @xmath14 , rescaled fermion masses , number of zero modes and the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is left intact .",
    "the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is a priori unknown , although the general expectation @xcite is that since both the sextet and the fundamental representations are complex for @xmath0 the pattern will be the same , @xmath51 .",
    "hence it is expected that the same rmt ensemble , the chiral unitary , will describe both models .",
    "the rmt predictions are different in each zero mode sector , labeled by @xmath20 . for the fundamental representation",
    "the index theorem equates @xmath20 with the topological charge but for higher dimensional representations the relation becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the trace normalization factor of the representation .",
    "overlap fermions possess exact zero modes giving rise to a well - defined @xmath20 even at finite lattice spacing .",
    "however at finite lattice spacing @xmath54 can actually be a fractional number but the number of configurations with this property disappears in the continuum limit @xcite .    at realistic lattice spacing a sizable number of configurations",
    "have a non - integer @xmath55 and the distribution of dirac eigenvalues on these configurations can also be compared with rmt .",
    "this is possible because the rmt partition function is directly sensitive to the number of zero modes @xmath20 regardless of what its interpretation is in terms of topological charges in the underlying theory .    in the quenched approximation , @xmath1",
    ", the condition @xmath25 is not relevant but the first condition , @xmath24 , does impose a lower bound on @xmath23 .",
    "how large @xmath23 has to be in order to separate the rotator and goldstone modes in the finite volume chiral hamiltonian so that chiral perturbation theory is applicable , depends on the representation .",
    "we will see that different volumes will be required for the fundamental and sextet representations .",
    "however once the volume is large enough , the universal behavior sets in and the choice of representation will not matter anymore .      if the theory flows to a non - trivial conformal fixed point in the infrared , no scale is generated and @xmath56 .",
    "the spectral density of the dirac operator is ( ) ~^3- , where @xmath57 is the anomalous dimension of @xmath58 and is calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "up to 2-loops the universal first two @xmath59-function coefficients determine the fixed point coupling @xmath60 and @xmath61 . this calculation can be trusted close to the upper end of the conformal window but might break down close to the lower end @xcite .    in the free case @xmath62 and",
    "the eigenvalue spacing is inversely proportional to the linear size @xmath23 in finite volume .",
    "the robust prediction of rmt in the chirally broken case was that the eigenvalue spacing is inversely proportional to the volume @xmath63 ; see ( [ chideltal ] ) . in the non - trivial conformal case @xmath64 and what is expected to hold",
    "is that the eigenvalue spacing is inversely proportional to the linear size to some power which is much less than @xmath65 but of course larger than @xmath66 .",
    "this is because anomalous dimensions can not deviate too much from the free value because the fixed point @xmath60 can not deviate too much from @xmath67 since chiral symmetry would be broken by a large coupling precluding the existence of a fixed point .",
    "it is worth noting that the deconfined phase of qcd where chiral symmetry is restored , especially if the temperature is well above @xmath68 , might bare some resemblance to theories with a weak - coupling conformal fixed point .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution also in this case does not follow rmt because chiral symmetry is intact .",
    "there exist models of the dirac spectrum that match simulation data rather nicely @xcite and some ingredients of these models might very well prove useful for the study of weakly - coupled conformal gauge theories as well .",
    "the exact solution of the rmt model in the large @xmath34 limit , given by ( [ pzetak ] , [ p12 ] ) for the eigenvalue distributions , is quite compact but still includes a number of integrals .",
    "the numerical evaluation of these integrals , especially for high @xmath20 and/or @xmath38 , is not entirely straightforward due to large cancellations . since in the sextet case",
    "@xmath69 one encounters @xmath70 quite frequently which are high enough so that the instabilities make the numerical integration cumbersome .",
    "we found it easier to directly simulate the matrix model ( [ rmtz ] ) .",
    "in each zero mode sector , @xmath71 , the random matrix model ( [ rmtz ] ) at @xmath1 was simulated for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the number of configurations was around @xmath74 for each and since their deviation from each other was negligible relative to the statistical uncertainty in the gauge theory simulation , @xmath75 was chosen as the @xmath76 limit .",
    "the rmt results quoted in the remainder of this work are based on @xmath75 ensembles , with about @xmath77 configurations in each sector ( except for low @xmath38 and @xmath20 where the exact results are used in some of the plots ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the overlap operator @xmath79 lie on a circle of radius @xmath80 centered at @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the negative wilson mass entering its definition .",
    "the non - real eigenvalues come in pairs , @xmath83 , with @xmath84 . picking the ones on the upper half plane , these",
    "are then stereographically projected from @xmath85 onto the positive imaginary axis to obtain the real and positive eigenvalues @xmath26 that are used for the comparison with rmt , = .    for the sextet representation , @xmath86 .",
    "this means that about @xmath21 times more eigenvalues have to be computed for the sextet operator than for the fundamental in order to end up with non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "the dimension of the sextet representation is @xmath87 times larger than the fundamental resulting in @xmath65 times more operations .",
    "these two facts result in about an order of magnitude increase in computational cost for sextet eigenvalues relative to the fundamental .",
    "a comparison of rmt and qcd with overlap fundamental fermions has been reported in @xcite for @xmath1 and in @xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "the sextet representation and rmt have been considered in @xcite within the staggered formulation .",
    "the simulation parameters are summarized in table [ simparam ] .",
    "the lattices in set @xmath88 have physical volume @xmath89 and the lattices in set @xmath90 have @xmath91 .",
