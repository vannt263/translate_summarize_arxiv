    "it has become self - evident that the spin properties of interacting electrons or holes in two - dimensions ( 2d ) play a central role in the transport properties of these systems , in particular in the possible metal - to - insulator transition ( mit ) observed in a number of different material systems , such as si - mosfets , n- and p - doped gaas , alas , and sige .",

    "@xcite on the saturation of the conductance as a function of the magnetic field parallel to the 2d plane ( see also ref . ) , combined with previous analysis of shubnikov - de haas oscillations in tilted magnetic field,@xcite suggest that the insulating state is spin polarized .",
    "these experimental observations revive an unresolved theoretical problem on the possible phases of electronic systems in 2d as a function of the interaction strength ( or , alternatively , the density ) even in the idealized clean systems . bergman and rice @xcite raised the possibility that as the density is decreased , there is a transition from a paramagnetic fermi liquid into a ferromagnetic fermi liquid state .",
    "quantum monte carlo studies by tanatar and ceperley@xcite have considered three different electronic states , a paramagnetic liquid , a ferromagnetic liquid , and a wigner crystal , and found a transition from the paramagnetic liquid to the wigner crystal at @xmath1 .",
    "however , the energies of these three phases become rather close for a range of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable that either improved energy estimations , or disorder effects , may bring the energy of the ferromagnetic state to lower values , so that it may exist for a window of densities between the paramagnetic liquid and the wigner crystal . indeed ,",
    "perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) calculations for disordered and interacting electrons in 2d by finkelstein@xcite have pointed out a runaway flow in the triplet channel even in the limit of low densities ( see also ref . ) .",
    "this runaway has been recently interpreted as a tendency towards ferromagnetism in the diffusive ( metallic ) regime,@xcite suggesting that disorder may also help trigger a full spin polarization at low densities .",
    "recent numerical studies have also indicated a strong tendency towards spin polarization in the localized regime.@xcite    provided the recent experimental evidence from transport measurements ( not susceptibility measurements ) for the ferromagnetic state of dilute 2d electrons , we investigate the effect of enhanced spin fluctuations on the paramagnetic side of the transition .",
    "we assume that the paramagnetic state can be described , for densities above a critical density @xmath3 and for finite temperatures below the fermi energy , by the fermi liquid phenomenology .",
    "as one approaches the critical density , one of the landau fermi liquid parameters , @xmath4 , which renormalizes the spin susceptibility , crosses the minimum bound for the pomeranchuk s stability condition .",
    "we argue that the proximity to the ferromagnetic instability leads to an attractive interaction for a range of densities preceding the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "the attraction , in the triplet channel , leads to p - wave pairing .",
    "once the system enters the ferromagnetic state , the paramagnon exchange mechanism for the attraction rapidly decreases , and these two phases compete to the point where the p - wave state ceases to exist at a density @xmath5 . therefore , there are two quantum critical points in the phase diagram at densities @xmath5 and @xmath3 ( likely very close ) , and there is an intermediate region in densities where the two phases coexist , but in which the p - wave pairing is in a nonunitary state . at the mean field level , the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase diagram ] .",
    "the possibility of unconventional pairing in an electronic system has been recently considered in the context of layered sr@xmath6ruo@xmath7 . in the sr@xmath8ru@xmath9o@xmath10 series , where @xmath11 determines the number of ruo@xmath6 planes in the unit cell , ferromagnetic states",
    "are observed for @xmath12 .",
    "it is believed that the proximity to ferromagnetism plays an important role for superconductivity in the ruthenates , and p - wave symmetry was proposed on the basis of similarities to @xmath0he.@xcite although a direct transition between ferromagnetic and superconducting states has not been experimentally observed , the ruthenates show similarities to the problem studied in this work . we should point out , however , that in ruthenates there is true 3d long range order , while we discuss systems that are truly two - dimensional and therefore subject to strong fluctuations .",
    "we also draw a strong analogy between the 2d electronic states and the 3d @xmath0he systems in a number of ways.@xcite for one , we argue that the fermi liquid phenomenology should not be dismissed in describing the 2d interacting electronic system in the metallic side of the transition at finite temperatures .",
    "one of the usual concerns that is raised against the fermi liquid state in the 2d problem at low densities is that the ratio between the coulomb and kinetic energies is about a factor of ten .",
    "this logic can be misleading , a ) since the contributions from exchange and correlations reduce this ratio , and b ) fermi liquid parameters , which measure the strength of the interaction relative to the kinetic energy , are typically large compared to unity even for 3d @xmath0he .",
    "for example , the landau parameters for @xmath0he at high pressure ( @xmath13 bar ) that renormalize the compressibility , magnetic susceptibility , effective mass , and spin precession rate are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17.@xcite even though most landau parameters are very large when compared to unit , the normal phase of @xmath0 he is very well described by landau s fermi liquid theory . indeed , if any",
    ", the real question is why landau s phenomenology works so well , way beyond the perturbative regime where rg arguments for fermions @xcite justify the stability of the fermi liquid .",
    "we show that we can consistently interpret the recent data on the 2d mit transition close to the critical density @xcite as due to the enhancement of the landau parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the paramagnon exchange mechanism can be responsible for an attraction in the triplet channel in the 2d electron problem , in complete analogy with the problem of 3d @xmath0he .",
    "the major difference between these two systems is the dimensionality : in 2d true superconductivity or superfluidity is only possible at zero temperature .",
    "strong fluctuations in 2d do not allow for long range order .",
    "for a singlet paired state in 2d with u(1 ) symmetry algebraic order can be established below the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) temperature.@xcite however , for a triplet paired state where the order parameter is a complex vector and the symmetry group is nonabelian , superconductivity can only be established at @xmath18.@xcite we thus propose that the insulating state is ferromagnetic , while the metallic state corresponds to a paired p - wave state .",
    "the possibility of _ singlet _ superconductivity in the observed conducting phase of the 2d electron systems was suggested by phillips _ et al._@xcite and belitz and kirkpatrick;@xcite here we present a possible mechanism for pairing ( without finite temperature long - range order ) in the _ triplet _",
    "channel.@xcite    we would like to stress that we do not address in this paper the reason why the measured conductance in si - mosfets seems to saturate in the triplet paired state when @xmath19 . in the case of singlet paired superconducting 2d materials ( thin films ) and 2d josephson junction arrays , where a finite kt transition should be observed together with the vanishing of the resistivity , a saturation of the conductivity is also observed.@xcite the source and precise mechanism for these dissipative effects are presently unknown , despite some recent theoretical efforts.@xcite    there is a natural question regarding the possibility of a paired state in the 2d electronic systems where the mit is observed : why can one have pairing if the conductance is of order @xmath20 near the transition ? naively , if one uses intuition from noninteracting electrons , then the bare value of the conductance is @xmath21 ; weak localization corrections , perturbative in @xmath22 , are added to this bare value .",
    "this would imply that @xmath23 at the transition , and therefore disorder is too strong and pair breaking .",
    "however , the value of @xmath24 that one reads from this naive argument is _ not _ a measure of disorder alone .",
    "the energy scale of the interactions is larger than the fermi energy of the 2d electron systems near the transition , thus the scattering of electrons even if the disorder is weak should be large and dominant . therefore , a dimensionless conductance of order unity does not necessarily imply strong disorder .",
    "for example , it is known that near 2d superconducting - insulator ( sc - i ) transitions the dimensionless conductance is of order one even in the absence of disorder.@xcite we claim that the same happens in the context of the mit transition discussed here .",
    "we also give arguments showing , based on fermi liquid theory , that near the ferromagnetic transition the paramagnetic scattering can provide for conductances of order unity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : landau ] we discuss the landau s fermi liquid phenomenology applied to the paramagnetic phase of the 2d electronic system , and the pomeranchuk instability leading to ferromagnetism at low densities .",
    "we argue that the enhancement in spin fluctuations due to the proximity to the ferromagnetic state causes an attractive interaction in the triplet channel and p - wave pairing .",
    "section [ sec : two - fluid ] contains a discussion of a two - component model for the mit transition , where we argue that , due to electron - electron interactions in the presence of disorder , the dimensionless conductance due to paramagnetic scattering can become of order unit close to the transition .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram of the problem is established in section [ sec : one ] using a generic ginzburg - landau free energy for a p - wave paired state coupled to a ferromagnetic order parameter . in section [ sec : experiments ] we compare our results to the available experimental data for parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields for the 2d electron gas in a si - mosfet and propose new shot noise experiments that can test our theory .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "our starting point is a landau fermi liquid theory for the metallic phase of the 2d electronic system .",
    "we consider first the effects of interactions , and then those of disorder .",
    "let us briefly review and then apply the landau phenomenology to the experimental observations on si - mosfets .",

    "the ground state of the problem is described in terms of quasiparticles that fill up a fermi sea up to the fermi energy .",

    "e^i n _ k , k where @xmath11 gives the angular momentum in the plane , and @xmath34 is the angle between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is useful to define dimensionless parameters @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the 2d density of states at the fermi energy .    the stability of the fermi liquid state ( or the fermi surface )",
    "is given , in landau s theory , by the pomeranchuk criterion , which in 2d can be written as f^s , a_n > -1 [ pomeranchuk ] for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "since all the physical quantities in landau s theory can be written in terms of the landau parameters , a violation of the pomeranchuk criterion implies an instability of a physical observable .",
    "the compressibility , for instance , is given by = and an instability to phase separation implies that @xmath39.@xcite in the same theory the effective mass is given by = 1 + f^s_1 , [ effective mass ] vanishing when @xmath40 ( here @xmath41 is the carrier band mass ) .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility can be written as = ( ) ^2 , [ sus ] where @xmath42 is the bare ( band ) land @xmath43-factor .",
    "thus , for @xmath44 the magnetic susceptibility diverges , indicating an instability towards a magnetically ordered phase .",
    "as one of the landau parameters approaches the critical value given by pomeranchuk s criterion , there is a strong enhancement of the interactions in the fermi liquid .",
    "consider , for instance , the case of density - density interactions that are determined by @xmath45 .",
    "it can be shown that the induced density - density interaction in a fermi liquid ( in the static limit ) is given by the usual rpa expression @xcite u_- = .",
    "thus , close to the pomeranchuk s instability @xmath46 the interaction is very large and attractive , leading to phase separation . on the other hand ,",
    "the induced spin - spin interactions in the same system is given by u_- = ^ , where @xmath47 is the electron spin .",
    "therefore , when @xmath48 , that is , close to the magnetic instability , this interaction is also large and attractive , leading to pairing in a spin triplet channel .",
    "in fact , we can estimate the size of the pairing amplitude using the weak coupling bcs expression |_p|",
    "e_f e^-|| , [ pairing amplitude ] where the fermi energy @xmath49 works as a cutoff in the problem because is the only energy scale present.@xcite obviously , we have to consider eq .",
    "( [ pairing amplitude ] ) carefully since , as the system approaches the instability , the attraction is very strong and the weak coupling expression breaks down ; in this case , one should use a strong coupling approximation.@xcite thus , the expression in eq .",
    "( [ pairing amplitude ] ) can still be used when the attraction is weak @xmath50 and is only a crude estimate when @xmath51 .    in general",
    ", one expects the landau parameters to be dependent on the electronic density @xmath11 .",
    "let us consider the situation of a fermi liquid close to a magnetic instability that happens at @xmath52 .",
    "the landau parameter , @xmath53 , can be expanded close to the transition as f_0^a ( ) = -1 + + o[^2 ] , [ landau expansion ] where @xmath54 is a constant and = measures the distance from the quantum critical point . in eq .",
    "( [ landau expansion ] ) we disregard higher order terms in the density variations around the critical point .",
    "observe that in this case the magnetic susceptibility can be written from eq .",
    "( [ sus ] ) as ( ) & & , [ divergences ] showing that the susceptibility diverges linearly with the distance from the critical point .",
    "notice , from eq .",
    "( [ pairing amplitude ] ) , that the weak coupling expression for the pairing amplitude close to the transition is given by |_p()| e_f e^- || e_f .",
    "[ delta ef ] this result indicates that the pairing amplitude is of order of the fermi energy in the system . in the case of the 2d si - mosfets",
    ", @xmath49 is usually of order of @xmath55 k because of the low electronic density .",
    "the critical temperature , @xmath56 , however , remains zero because of the dimensionality of the system , otherwise this problem would be a case of high temperature superconductivity .",
    "notice that the number of pairs is @xmath57 at zero temperature .",
    "away from the transition we can classify the behavior of the system depending on the full density dependence of @xmath4 . at large enough densities , @xmath58",
    ", @xmath4 should become positive because of the screening of the electronic interactions by backflow effects . in this case , without the help of pairing , the localization effects should dominate , and the system should become an anderson insulator .",
    "so it is only in this high density ( @xmath58 ) regime that one could possibly attempt to apply ideas established through the scaling theory of localization@xcite for noninteracting electrons .",
    "for @xmath59 we have @xmath60 and pairing is effective in delocalizing the electrons , leading to the metallic state observed experimentally . in this regime , naive intuition based on noninteracting electrons should not apply .",
    "finally , for @xmath61 , the system becomes a ferromagnet .",
    "we will return to this regime later when we consider a landau - ginzburg theory describing the system .",
    "we show that there is a coexistence region with both p - wave pairing and ferromagnetism for densities @xmath62 , and for @xmath63 the physics of the problem is the one of a ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "we have argued that the proximity to the ferromagnetic instability induces pairing in the fermi liquid state .",
    "the effects of strong interactions are built in in this picture , but we still need to discuss the effect of disorder in this paired state ( which we argue in section [ sec : one ] should be in fact a fully gapped @xmath64 state ) . the question to be addressed is : will the paired state survive disorder ? as it is known for the case of strongly coupled superconductors , which is the case here , when the electron mean free path , @xmath24 , becomes of the order of the coherence length , @xmath65 , pairing is suppressed.@xcite since the pairing amplitude is essentially of order of @xmath49 [ see eq .",
    "( [ delta ef ] ) ] , the coherence length is of the order of the fermi wavelength , _ sc = , [ xis ] and of the size of the interparticle spacing .",
    "therefore , pairing should survive as long as @xmath66 , or equivalently , @xmath67 .",
    "the main question here is whether this condition is satisfied in the heterostrutures where the mit is observed .",
    "we argue below in favor of this case .",
    "the common belief is that close to the mit transition @xmath68 because the dimensionless conductance at the transition is of order one .",
    "this indeed would be the case if the value of the conductance would be completely fixed by the amount of disorder in the sample .",
    "however , as we have shown , there are strong electron - electron interactions close to the ferromagnetic transition ( indeed interactions are the _ reason _ for the instability , since @xmath69 )",
    ". these interactions in the presence of localized electronic spins , as we are going to show in section [ sec : two - fluid ] , can provide a large contribution to the resistance .",
    "in other words , the value of the critical resistivity , @xmath70 , can be of order @xmath71 from interaction effects even if disorder is small .",
    "the concept of using @xmath72 as a measure disorder is only good if one could determine what @xmath24 is independently of a conductivity measurement , because otherwise strong interaction effects will blend in and make such discussion useless .",
    "therefore , in strongly correlated systems one should be careful in extending arguments that are only valid for noninteracting systems .",
    "> from a theoretical perspective , it is known that interactions alone can lead to a universal conductivity of order @xmath73 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , for the 2d superconductor - to - insulator transition in the clean bose - hubbard model ( belonging to the 3d - xy model universality class ) , the conductivity is given by @xmath74 .",
    "it was argued in ref . that this transition is in the same universality class of a superfluid - insulator transition for bosons moving in a random potential . in @xmath75 dimensions",
    ", it is known that the universality class of a superconductor to insulator transition for a model of fermions with attractive interactions is the same as the insulator to superfluid transition in a model of repulsively interacting bosons.@xcite since @xmath75 is the lower critical dimension for this type of transition,@xcite we expect this type of result to hold in our case as well .",
    "indeed , there is strong experimental evidence for these results in the superconducting to insulator transition in amorphous superconducting thin films.@xcite",
    "based on experimental evidence that the insulating phase in the 2d electron system is a ferromagnetic state , we have argued in section [ sec : landau ] that the proximity to the spin polarized state induces p - wave pairing on the metallic side of the mit . in this section",
    "we study the transition between the p - wave paired state and the ferromagnetic state using a two - component model .",
    "let us split the total electron density at @xmath18 into a localized ferromagnetic component , @xmath76 , and an itinerant , paired component , @xmath77 : n = n_l + 2 n_p .",
    "the dependence of both @xmath76 and @xmath77 as a function of @xmath11 is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : twofluid ] . for densities",
    "@xmath78 , all electrons are paired ( @xmath79 ) at @xmath18 , while for very low densities , all electrons are in the insulating ferromagnetic state ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "there is a region where the two components coexist : as the system starts to spin polarize below @xmath3 , the density of pairs starts to decrease , vanishing at some critical density @xmath81 . at very low densities ( @xmath82 ) the wigner crystal or",
    "bragg glass phase becomes the ground state.@xcite in this work , however , we do not attempt to study such phase , since it requires unscreened long range interactions that are not included in our formalism .",
    "the study of the wigner crystal would then need a different starting point , far from the mit .",
    "for this reason , the wigner crystal is absent in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ phase diagram ] .",
    "the appearance of a coexistence region is natural in the way we divide the two densities .",
    "it also follows from the competitive nature of the two phases , as the mechanism that leads to pairing - paramagnon exchange - is strongly suppressed as the system spin polarizes . the coexistence phase is also found within the landau - ginzburg theory of section [ sec : one ] , as a direct consequence of having two competing orders .",
    "the existence of metallic regions surrounding localized puddles of charge has been confirmed experimentally through ingenious local compressibility measurements in gaas / algaas samples.@xcite these experiments reveal that the fragmented localized regions increase in number as the density is lowered towards the mit .",
    "the appearance of these fragments in the metallic phase ( @xmath83 ) is consistent with the idea that some incipient magnetism is always present in diffusive systems , even when the interaction in the triplet channel is weak.@xcite in regions where strong magnetization occurs due to fluctuations in the wave functions , the paramagnon mechanism is absent , thus suppressing pairing and leading to localization .",
    "this is not taken into account in our mean - field ( homogeneous ) treatment of the problem ; had it been considered , it would likely prolongate the @xmath76 curve towards densities larger than @xmath3 ( not shown in fig . [",
    "fig : twofluid ] ) .",
    "next , we use this two - component picture to provide an argument on why the critical conductivity near the mit is of order @xmath20 .",
    "consider the situation at finite temperature within the coexistence window @xmath84 .",
    "while at zero temperature all the delocalized electrons ( with density @xmath85 ) participate in the pairing , at finite temperatures only a small fraction is really paired .",
    "the unpaired state can be described by the fermi liquid theory of section [ sec : landau ] .",
    "the localized ferromagnetic component is a source of spin scattering for the itinerant fermi liquid .",
    "the coupling h = j d^2r s_l(r ) s_it(r ) follows from splitting the electrons into two components in the effective hamiltonian for the interacting electron liquid . here",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are the electron spin operators for the localized and itinerant components of the electron system , respectively .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath88 can be obtained from the expression for the energy in the landau fermi liquid phenomenology .",
    "this interaction leads to a high temperature scattering time for the itinerant fluid given by & = & n(0 ) j^2 s(s+1 ) n_l + & = & ( f_0^a)^2 s(s+1 ) n_l for scattering off the spin @xmath89 ferromagnetic component .",
    "this gives a resistance _ s = = ^2 ( f_0^a)^2 s(s+1 ) . for a narrow coexistence region ,",
    "the landau parameter @xmath4 should be close to the pomeranchuk critical value of @xmath90 ; hence , the conductance is solely determined by the ratio @xmath91 : _ s .",
    "notice that this result implies that there can be a large variation of the resistivity in the critical region of the phase diagram .",
    "the scale for resistance is the prefactor ^_s , and if near the mit transition region the fractions of the two components are close , the ratio @xmath92 should be of order unit .",
    "hence , the high temperature resistance near the `` separatrix '' line should be of order @xmath93 , which gives a conductivity of order @xmath94 .",
    "this simple argument highlights the importance of considering the electron - electron interactions when calculating the resistivity of the system near the ferromagnetic instability ( @xmath95 ) .",

    "one problem could be that near the mit , with the field vanishing , and with the uncertainty in the position of the ferromagnetic transition ( notice again that in our theory there should be _ two _ quantum critical points ) , the exact form for the dependence of the saturation field @xmath168 as a function of @xmath189 and @xmath11 may be harder to obtain .",

    "the low-@xmath189 behavior follows simply from the finite - temperature fermi liquid susceptibility .",
    "the high temperature behavior , on the other hand , is due to the fact that the susceptibility should , in this temperature regime , obey a curie law .",

    "for a given filling fraction @xmath194 and at lower densities , close to but higher than the zero field @xmath5 ( see ref . ) , the quantized hall states are lost .",
    "this occurs at some critical density @xmath199 , at which the states at the center of the landau band localize , and the longitudinal resistance diverges as @xmath200 .",
    "it is known@xcite that @xmath199 varies substantially along the `` landau fan '' .",
    "in fact , it has been shown by kravchenko and collaborators that if the electron system is spin polarized in the plane ( by a parallel magnetic field ) and a perpendicular field is applied , the localization effects occur already at higher densities.@xcite this demonstrates the importance of spin interactions in the problem : the correlation effects are reduced when fully spin polarization is achieved , making the system closer to noninteracting and thus more sensitive to localization effects .",
    "one of the most interesting observations is that for @xmath201 , corresponding to filling factors within the cyclotron gaps , the localization occurs at higher densities ( or magnetic fields fields ) than for @xmath202 , where filling factors fall into spin gaps ( recall that @xmath181 ) .",
    "this effect has not been quantitatively explained so far .",
    "we show below that it can be understood as the localization of the carriers due to the enhancement of the spin susceptibility near the zero - field critical density @xmath5 .",
    "as pointed out earlier , at the localization transition there is an enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility , and consequently of the effective land @xmath43-factor , @xmath203 .",
    "therefore , the zeeman splitting energy e_z(n ) = g^_b h _ [ zeeman ] becomes large and of order of the cyclotron energy .",

    "( [ eq : geffective ] ) ] , g^= , [ geff ] which diverges at the quantum critical point .",
    "this implies that there is a level crossing between the down spin state of the @xmath204th landau level with the spin up state of the @xmath205th landau level .",
    "when the crossing occurs there is an excess magnetization in the system and , in particular , at low field ( around 1 tesla ) , for the case of @xmath206 ( see below ) , the system becomes fully polarized .",
    "the experimental evidence is that at this point the carriers localize since the longitudinal resistivity increases as @xmath207.@xcite this observation implies that below the critical density and in the presence of an applied magnetic field , the localized state , independent of the direction of the field , is indeed spin polarized .    to illustrate this effect ,",
    "consider the situation when the magnetic field is enough to produce a @xmath206 state . in this case",
    "there are equal number of up and down spins filling the first landau level with energy @xmath208 . at large densities",
    "the zeeman energy is insignificant when compared to @xmath209 and the up and down spin states can be considered as degenerate . as the density",

    "thus , there is a critical density @xmath212 such that the previously empty second landau level for spin up , @xmath213 , becomes degenerate with the first landau level with spin down , @xmath214 .",

    "the agreement is good and gives extra support to the idea that the localized state is indeed ferromagnetic even when the field is perpendicular to the 2d electron gas .",
    "we remark , however , that we do not expect the same estimate of @xmath224 to be applicable to the states @xmath225 and @xmath226 , since they vanish at densities sufficiently far from @xmath5 to invalidate the use of expansion implicit in eq .",

    "charge carrier component in the metallic phase , for all values of @xmath168 , instead of two independent spin up and down components .",

    "in this paper we argue that one can account , on the basis of landau fermi liquid theory , for the recent experimental observations that the characteristic magnetic field @xmath168 needed to saturate the conductance in 2d si - mosfets at low temperatures vanishes at a critical value of the electronic density @xmath3 .",
    "we propose a phenomenological expansion for the landau parameter @xmath232 in terms of the electronic density @xmath11 that drives the system ferromagnetic , through a pomeranchuk instability , at @xmath3 .",

    "the values of the parameter @xmath103 estimated separately from parallel and perpendicular field experiments agree within 20% .    in the paramagnetic side , but close to the instability , the enhanced spin fluctuations can lead to an attractive interaction in the spin triplet channel , similarly to superfluid @xmath0he .",

    "however , the presence of the p - wave paired state for @xmath236 does not rule out the possibility of a conducting phase .",
    "since the order parameter for the p - wave state is a vector , no order ( even algebraic ) exists at finite temperature , and true superconductivity should only occur at @xmath18 . in this paper",
