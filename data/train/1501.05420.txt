    "the relation between radio surface brightness ( @xmath0 ) and diameter ( @xmath1 ) of supernova remnants ( snrs ) is usually used to determine the distance of a snr ( poveda & woltjer 1968 ; clark & caswell 1976 ; lozinskaya 1981 ; huang & thaddeus 1985 ; duric & seaquist 1986 ; guseinov et al .",
    "2003 ) , thus it has been widely discussed in many works via statistical or analytical approaches ( e.g. , poveda & woltjer 1968 ; clark & caswell 1976 ; mills et al . 1984 ; huang & thaddeus 1985 ; arbutina et al .",
    "2004 , pavlovic et al .",
    "2014 , etc . ) . among the statistical results of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation ,",
    "one straight line was often obtained by authors ( e.g. , poveda & woltjer 1968 ; huang & thaddeus 1985 ; arbutina et al .",
    "2004 ; pavlovi et al .",
    "2014 ) . in our paper ,",
    "after collecting 57 shell - type galactic supernova remnants data where some data have been updated according to green ( 2004 , 2009 & 2014 ) and other new references , we also make the statistical result of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation on these data by simply using the linear regression method ( pavlovic et al .",
    "2013 ) . here",
    ", the dominant selection effects are those that are applicable at radio wavelengths and same as green ( 2004 , 2009 & 2014 ) .",
    "our statistical result shows that the best fit line slope of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation with a straight line is @xmath2 , which is slightly flatter than those proposed by some other authors before .",
    "note that , however , a broken fit line or a transition point is also usually seen in the statistical results .",
    "for example , clark & caswell ( 1976 ) , allakhverdiyev et al . ( 1983 ) , and allakhverdiyev et al . (",
    "1985 ) have gotten a broken fit line in their statistical works . at 408  mhz ,",
    "clark & caswell ( 1976 ) had a broken line with slopes of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at @xmath5  pc/@xmath6  pc , while allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "( 1983 ) got @xmath7  pc at 408  mhz and @xmath8  pc at 1  ghz for 15 shell - type remnants .",
    "but yet , the research is few for the analytical interpretation on the broken line or transition point in the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) once made that @xmath9 @xmath10 which analytically predicted that there was a transition point for the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation of supernova remnants .",
    "but it should be truly said that the analytical interpretation on the broken line or transition point is still lost , i.e. , the exact analytical value of transition point is still absent . in order to fill this gap",
    ", we should further analytically investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation of supernova remnants .",
    "on the other hand , the galactic snrs are usually classified into three types : shell - type , plerion - type and composite - type . in our paper , for the simplicity , we just focus on investigating the shell - type galactic supernova remnants . for the shell - type galactic supernova remnants",
    ", they usually have four evolution stages : the free expansion phase , the adiabatic or sedov phase , the radiative or snowplough phase and the dissipation phase . in addition , nearly all of the detected shell - type snrs are at the adiabatic phase or the radiative phase , because almost none is observed in the 1st and 4th phases due to the fact that the shell - type snrs at these two phases are usually practically undetectable . therefore , a direct conjecture is that the theoretical interpretation for this transition point in the statistical results of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation may come from the phase transition between these two detectable shell - type snrs .",
    "after the analytically investigation on the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations both at the adiabatic phase and radiative phase of shell - type supernova remnants at 1 ghz , which is simply followed the work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) , our results show that indeed there can be a transition point between these two analytical @xmath0-@xmath1 relations in 30  pc at 1 ghz",
    ". moreover , this exact analytical value of transition point can be consistent with the statistical results made by some other authors before , i.e. 32  pc at 1 ghz made by allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follow . in section 2 , after collecting 57 shell - type galactic supernova remnants data at 1 ghz , we have made the statistical result of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation on these data , where the best fit line slope with a straight line is @xmath2 . in section 3 , after a brief review of the work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) , we simply follow their work and further analytically investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation at the radiative phase of shell - type galactic supernova remnants at 1 ghz .",
    "moreover , after several discussions , the transition point can analytically exist in 30  pc at 1 ghz between these two stages , which can be consistent with the statistical results . finally , a brief conclusion and discussion are given in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "we have collected 57 shell - type supernova remnants data in galaxy at 1 ghz and listed them in table  [ 57dtd ] , where some data have also been updated according to the new references . in order to make statistical result of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation on these data , we first obtain the surface brightness @xmath11 from this table , and the 1ghz surface brightness @xmath11 is given by ( clark & caswell 1976 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 1ghz flux density in jansky ( @xmath14 ) , and @xmath15 is the angular diameter in minutes of arc .",
    "then , we simply apply the linear regression method , i.e. , if the aim function is @xmath16 , the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 @xmath20 therefore , one can obtain @xmath21 which has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ statis ] .",
    "note that , for the convenience of plotting the figure , we have used the @xmath22 function , and the units of @xmath11 and @xmath1 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "in addition , since our investigations in the following mainly focus on the surface brightness at 1ghz , we will often ignore the bottom index in @xmath11 for our results , while sometimes @xmath1 is also expressed its unit in pc .    from the eq .",
    "(  [ lnsi - d ] ) , the final statistical result with a straight line on these data is @xmath25 comparing with other statistic results , i.e. , case & bhattacharya ( 1998 ) got a straight line @xmath26 and xu et al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived a straight flatter line @xmath27 we can find that all these corresponding best fit values , i.e. @xmath28 , are flatter than those derived by some authors at early time , which can reach as high as @xmath29 at 1  ghz ( pavlovi et al .",
    "2014 ) , @xmath30 ( allakhverdiyev et al . 1985 ) and @xmath31 ( clark & caswell 1976 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that , the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation with a broken line or transition point is also usually seen in the statistical results . for example , clark & caswell ( 1976 ) got a transition point about 32  pc in the diameter for 29 galactic snrs at 408  mhz , and 32  pc at 5000  mhz .",
    "allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "( 1983 ) got @xmath7  pc at 408  mhz for 15 shell - type remnants , and @xmath8  pc at 1  ghz . for a larger number of samples of 146",
    "all - sort galactic objects including plerion , shell and composite - type remnants , allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "( 1985 ) obtained @xmath32  pc at 1  ghz .",
    "therefore , making the statistical result of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for our collected 57 shell - type supernova remnants data with a broken line will be interesting",
    ". however , since there have been many statistical works with broken line referred to in the above , thus giving a theoretical interpretation of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation with a broken line or transition point will be more interesting and important . in the following , we will give a simple theoretical interpretation for this transition point .",
    "for the simplicity , we just focus on the shell - type galactic snrs .",
    "note that , nearly all of the detected shell - type snrs are at the adiabatic phase or the radiative phase . in order to give a theoretical interpretation of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation with a transition point ,",
    "we need further analytically investigation on the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations both at these two phases of shell - type snrs , which we just simply follow the work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) . for the convenience of comparison and making the whole paper more readable , here we also do a warmup to make a brief review on the work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) in this section , where they just analytically investigate the adiabatic phase .      taking the linear diameter ( @xmath1 ) of remnant in pc , time ( @xmath33 ) in s , snr initial explosion energy ( @xmath34 ) in the unit of ergs , and ism electron density ( @xmath35 ) in @xmath36 , from the standard sedov solution , one has the following equation ( bignami & caraveo 1988 , zaninetti 2000 , vlk et al .",
    "2002 , ptuskin & zirakashvili 2003 ) @xmath37 where the coefficient @xmath38 the shock wave velocity should be @xmath39 at the adiabatic phase , the thickness of remnant is proportional to @xmath1 ( milne 1970 ) , and the shell volume which contains all the radio - emitting particles is @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the volume coefficient . notice that condition @xmath42 has been assumed and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the inner and outer diameter of the remnant shell respectively . combining ( [ dt2 ] ) and ( [ vd2 ] ) , one obtains the volume of the shell with respect to @xmath33 @xmath45 as the shock waves of remnant travel , the ambient magnetic field @xmath46 at the adiabatic phase will decrease with @xmath1 according to ( duric & seaquist 1986 ) @xmath47 substituting ( [ dt2 ] ) to it , we have @xmath48 ginzburg & synovatskii ( 1965 ) and bell ( 1978 ) show that the radio emissivity @xmath49 of a shocked gas which are affected by a magnetic field to produce the synchrotron emission can be expressed as ( arbutina b. et al .",
    "2012 ) @xmath50 where the unit of @xmath51 is @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the function tabulated by ginzburg & synovatskii ( 1965 ) .",
    "the velocities of shock waves in the second and third phase of snrs are typically far less than @xmath55 .",
    "thus , ( [ radio emissivity ] ) can be further simplified @xmath56 taking account of ( [ dt2 ] ) , ( [ bt2 ] ) and the average value of the remnants spectral index @xmath57 , we can get @xmath58 which is at 1 ghz .",
    "if the shell volume is considered to be encompassed by the radiating electrons , the surface brightness of remnant can be written as ( duric & seaquist 1986 ) @xmath59 inserting ( [ dt2 ] )  ( [ a02 ] )  ( [ vt2 ] ) and ( [ ed2 ] ) into it , we obtain @xmath60 finally , one can get @xmath61 where @xmath62 here some typical values of physical parameters of snrs are taken : ism density @xmath63  @xmath36 , snr initial explosion energy @xmath64  erg , the diameter and ism magnetic field of remnant at the beginning of sedov phase @xmath65  pc and @xmath66  g , etc .",
    "therefore , the analytically derived line of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation at the second phase of shell - type snr can be @xmath67 note that , in order to keep consistent with the following analytical investigation on the radiative phase of shell - type , we have chosen different typical values .",
    "thus the coefficient in  ( [ relation at second phase ] ) is different from that in work duric & seaquist 1986 , but the power - law reminds the same slope .      it should be pointed out that the above work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) just analytically investigated the adiabatic phase of shell - type snrs .",
    "in fact , we can also simply follow their work to analytically investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation at the radiative phase of shell - type snrs . after setting the same choices of units as those in section ( [ sedov ] ) ,",
    "the equation for shell - type snrs at the radiative stage is ( mckee et al .",
    "( 1977 ) ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant @xmath70 from which , we obtain the velocity of shock wave at the radiative phase @xmath71 same as the adiabatic phase , the volume of shell can be @xmath72 if we roughly take @xmath73 , then the coefficient will be @xmath74 . changing the variant @xmath1 to @xmath33 , one can rewrite the volume of shell as @xmath75 note the truth that the ambient magnetic field @xmath46 of a remnant decreasing with the diameter @xmath1 at the adiabatic phase is ( [ bd2 ] ) , while at the dissipation - phase it is @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we can moderately suppose that the ambient magnetic field @xmath46 at the radiative phase can be @xmath77 where the parameter @xmath78 ranges from 0 to 1 . after substituting ( [ dt3 ] ) to it",
    ", one gets @xmath79 therefore , following the same steps as the above section and still taking @xmath80  @xmath36 , we can obtain the @xmath81 relation at the radiative phase at 1 ghz @xmath82 now we have the form @xmath83 where @xmath84      in order to discuss the transition point of @xmath0-d relations between the adiabatic phase and radiative phase , we set all the parameters at the radiative phase as their typical values , @xmath85 g , @xmath86 pc , @xmath87 .",
    "then , the @xmath0-d relation at the radiative phase is @xmath88    however , here it arises an interesting question that the initial typical value of diameter @xmath89 pc in ( [ bd3 ] ) at the radiative phase is not equal to the transition value of @xmath0-d relations between the adiabatic phase and radiative phase .",
    "note that , the exact transition value explicitly depends on the choice of typical values , i.e. @xmath90 , @xmath91 and so on . in order to clearly show this question and for the simplicity",
    ", here we investigate the dependence of exact transition value just on the initial value of diameter @xmath92 , i.e. varying @xmath92 and keeping other parameters as constants .",
    "in addition , for further convenient , we sign @xmath93 as the transition diameter of @xmath0-d relations between the adiabatic phase and radiative phase , which satisfies @xmath94    after investigating ( [ sigmad32 ] ) and  ( [ mr3 ] ) , we can find that the coefficient @xmath95 is sensitive to the initial value of diameter @xmath92 at the radiative phase .",
    "in fact , in the case of ( [ stdinit ] ) , the @xmath96 is 108.2 pc , which is larger than 20 pc .",
    "if we choose the @xmath97 pc , we can obtain @xmath98 pc .",
    "however , the difference is that @xmath99 in this case , while @xmath100 in the previous result .",
    "these two results can implicate that the radio surface brightness of snr may have a bound when the snr transits from adiabatic phase to radiative phase .",
    "note that , there is another case such that @xmath101 if we choose an appropriate value of @xmath92 . after expressing @xmath93 as the function of @xmath92",
    ", we can obtain @xmath102 where @xmath93 and @xmath92 are in the unit of pc .",
    "thus if @xmath103 , one can easily derive the appropriate @xmath92 @xmath104 after compared with the statistics results , i.e. , allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "( 1983 ) obtained @xmath8  pc at 1  ghz , it seems that the most possible case is that there is no bound but a transition point at @xmath105 for the radio surface brightness of snr when the snr transits from adiabatic phase to radiative phase .",
    "in this paper , we have collected 57 shell - type snrs data in galaxy among the references , and made the statistical result of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation on these data by simply using the linear regression method , where the best fit line slope with a straight line is @xmath2 . for further giving a theoretical interpretation of broken line of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation by some other statistical results",
    ", we also carefully analytically investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations both at the adiabatic phase and radiative phase .",
    "we find that there indeed can be an analytical transition point between these two phases .",
    "moreover , this exact analytical value of transition point can be consistent with some statistical results .",
    "therefore , two significant consequence can also be concluded .",
    "the first is that this transition point can be produced by the phase transition of shell - type snrs .",
    "the second is that the empirical relation with a transition point for @xmath0-@xmath1 relation via statistics may be more applicable .",
    "note that , some progresses of the investigations on the statistical or theoretical @xmath0-@xmath1 relations have also been made in the last several decades .",
    "for example , pavlovic et al.(2013 ) have referred to that there have been some new regression methods to make the statistical results , i.e. double regression and orthogonal regression , while berezhko & volk ( 2004 ) have proposed new analysis on the theoretical interpretation of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation . in our paper , since we just first collect and update the snrs data according to the new references , and then mainly focus on giving a theoretical interpretation of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation with a transition point , thus here we all just use the simple analyses , i.e. simply using the linear regression method to make the statistics and just generalizing the work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) to the radiative phase .",
    "it should be pointed out that our simple analyses seems to be enough viewed from our results , i.e. , indeed we have obtained the transition point from the theoretical investigation and furthermore this transition point can be consistent with the statistical result .",
    "moreover , we can conclude that the empirical relation with a transition point for @xmath0-@xmath1 relation via statistics maybe be more applicable .",
    "however , it will be still interesting in the future work to have further investigations on our statistical and theoretical results by taking the new analyses into account .",
    "some other discussions related to our results in this paper are also ordered .",
    "first , it should be pointed out that the transition point @xmath96 is sensitive to those parameters such as the volume coefficient @xmath106 , mean electron density @xmath35 , snr initial explosion energy @xmath107 , magnetic field at the beginning of the evolving second - stage and third - stage @xmath108 and @xmath90 , and the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath91 . meanwhile",
    ", the true physical process of the third stage of supernova remnant is complicated .",
    "therefore , for the simplicity , we just consider the synchrotron radiation equation  ( [ radio emissivity2 ] ) is still valid in the third stage , and only take the effect of @xmath91 into account in the above to obtain the transition point .",
    "in fact , we can also take the effects of other parameters into account , i.e. the effect of the electron density @xmath35 .",
    "note that , throughout the paper we take the electron density @xmath63  @xmath36 at both the adiabatic phase and radiative phase .",
    "one can see that the electron density @xmath35 denotes the density of electrons inside snr shell which emits synchrotron radiation according to ( [ ebv2 ] ) .",
    "these electrons can come from not only the interstellar media ( ism ) with particle density typically equals to 0.1  @xmath36 , but also the snr progenitor .",
    "thus the electron density will be truly larger than 0.1  @xmath36 , and hence the value of @xmath96 obtained will also be different .",
    "therefore , the further effects of other parameters on the exact transition point will be an interesting open issue .",
    "in addition , we would like to discuss the validity of the equation  ( [ radio emissivity2 ] ) . obviously , it is valid just when the velocity of shock wave is much less than @xmath110 .",
    "according to  ( [ dt2 ] )  ( [ vt2 ] ) , the corresponding diameter at the second phase should be much larger than 10.6  pc when @xmath111 and @xmath80  @xmath36 . and when @xmath112 , the corresponding diameter is 22.9  pc ( if snr is still at the second phase ) which is close to the transition point .",
    "therefore , according to the above analysis , the equation  ( [ radio emissivity2 ] ) is valid at least in the end of the second phase , which shows that the transition point @xmath105 is reasonable . of course , if the initial values of snr such as @xmath113 are different , the discussion may also be changed , which can be further studied .",
    "finally , an interesting result may also be implicated from our analytical results of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations both at the adiabatic phase and radiative phase , which is that a new state may exist between the adiabatic phase and radiative phase for the shell - type snrs . since the time at the transition point @xmath114 for the adiabatic phase and radiative phase from the equations ( [ dt2 ] ) and ( [ dt3 ] ) is @xmath115yr and @xmath116yr respectively , which is obvious that @xmath117 . note that , the typical lifetime of adiabatic phase and radiative phase are @xmath118 yr and @xmath119 yr , and @xmath120 is close to the typical lifetime of adiabatic phase @xmath118 yr .",
    "therefore , we conjecture that @xmath121 maybe can remain constant , i.e , @xmath122 pc when @xmath33 ranges from @xmath123 to @xmath120 . in other words , there may be a stable state between the adiabatic phase and radiative phase .",
    "however , the situation is obviously weird that the snr diameter can stay constant ( = 30 pc ) for ages ranging from 27.9 yr to 3387.8 yr , therefore , the underlying physics on how the snr expansion could stop from some time to restart later on and the experimental observation are needed to be further found out .",

    "<S> our statistical result shows that the best fit line slope of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is @xmath2 , which is slightly flatter than those proposed by some other authors before . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , comparing with the statistical results of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation by some other authors , we can find that a transition point is usually introduced in their statistical results . in order to make a theoretical interpretation for this transition point in the statistical results of @xmath0-@xmath1 relation </S>",
    "<S> , we also analytically investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of shell - type supernova remnants at 1 ghz both at the adiabatic phase and radiative phase , which is simply followed the work duric & seaquist ( 1986 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results show that indeed there can be a transition point at 1 ghz between these two analytical @xmath0-@xmath1 relations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the analytical transition point is 30  pc , which can be consistent with the statistical results at 1 ghz made by some other authors before , i.e. 32  pc at 1 ghz made by allakhverdiyev et al . </S>",
