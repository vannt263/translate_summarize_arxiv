    "dense molecular cores are the immediate precursors of new stars on small scales , and understanding how they grow and evolve is fundamental to the theory of star formation @xcite .",
    "because many elements are involved in core formation , complete theoretical models have not yet been developed , and it is not yet clear whether a single dynamical effect dominates the overall process , or whether several contributing effects have comparable importance . in one limit that has been studied in some detail ,",
    "ambient velocities are negligible , and self - gravitating cores form by the slow diffusion of partially - ionized gas through strongly - supporting magnetic fields until a supercritical configuration is reached ( e.g. @xcite ) . in another limit , which has been considered more recently  but in much less detail at core scales , magnetic support is negligible , and supersonic turbulence creates and destroys condensations , with some fraction of this gas sufficiently dense and long - lived that it can undergo collapse ( e.g. @xcite ) . as observed clouds are both magnetized and strongly turbulent , the eventual theory for core formation that is developed must account for both processes ; pioneering work towards this goal has begun ( e.g. @xcite ) . because of the technical challenges involved in building comprehensive models and the need to elucidate the contributing physics , it is important to develop simplified models in greater detail . in this contribution",
    ", we consider aspects of core growth and evolution in the turbulence - dominated , unmagnetized limit .",
    "increasingly detailed observations in recent years provide constraints on theoretical models ( see e.g. the reviews of @xcite ) .",
    "one class of observations focuses on the density distribution within cores .",
    "one - dimensional ( angle - averaged ) density profiles ( e.g. ) generally show a uniform - density center surrounded by a power - law envelope extending to an outer radius @xmath7 , which is consistent with the density profile of a static , isothermal , unmagnetized bonnor - ebert ( hereafter be ) sphere @xcite .",
    "the interpretation in terms of static equilibrium is problematic , however , insofar as many cases show center - to - edge density contrasts exceeding the maximum ratio ( @xmath8 ; here @xmath9 is the central density ) that would be stable against collapse , and would also require central temperatures greater than observed values in order to provide support for the total masses inferred from the integrated continuum emission .",
    "in addition , cores are generally not isolated ; rather than being surrounded by a high - temperature , low - density medium with pressure matching the core s outer edge , they are surrounded by moderate - density cold molecular gas representing clumps and filaments within larger clouds .",
    "the interpretation of observed density profiles as static solutions is also not unique , in that dynamically - collapsing cores initiated from near - critical equilibrium show the same density profiles as ( supercritical ) static solutions ( see e.g. @xcite , and below ) .",
    "concentrations formed within turbulent flows can also have density profiles resembling be spheres @xcite .",
    "velocity information can distinguish between static , oscillating @xcite , and collapsing cores , and can potentially also help discriminate how these cores formed out of more diffuse gas .",
    "dense , low - mass cores generally have subsonic internal velocity dispersions , whether for isolated cores or for cores found in clusters ( e.g. ) . in cores containing protostars , signatures of infall on small scales ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "believed to be indicative of gravitational collapse , have been observed via the asymmetry of molecular lines that trace high - density gas ( e.g. @xcite ) . for starless cores ,",
    "inward motions are often evident over both small ( @xmath11 ) and larger scales ( @xmath12 ) , sometimes encompassing a whole star - forming complex ( @xcite ; see also ) .",
    "small - scale inward motions within cores are subsonic @xcite , while larger - scale motions can be transonic or supersonic ( @xcite infer higher velocities in lower - density gas ) , and may be indicative of converging larger - scale flows in which dense gas builds up in a shock - bounded stagnation region .    the relative durations of starless and protostellar ( i.e. containing an accreting embedded class 0 or i object ) stages of core evolution are determined by comparing the relative numbers of the two classes of sources in a given cloud .",
    "absolute core lifetimes are further obtained by comparison to the number of t tauri stars with measured ages .",
    "several studies using this statistical approach in different clouds have reached similar conclusions : the durations of the starless and accreting stages of cores are comparable .",
    "typical starless core lifetimes are estimated at @xmath13 , amounting to a few times the free - fall time @xmath14 measured at the mean core density @xmath15 . with lifetimes considerably below the ambipolar diffusion time for strong magnetic fields @xmath16 ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", this suggests that observed cores are gravitationally supercritical with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by magnetic field zeeman observations , indicating that cores have mean mass - to - magnetic - flux ratios two times the critical value @xcite . since cores are only identified in millimeter and submillimeter continuum when the @xmath17 exceeds a few @xmath18 , in principle it is possible that an extended period of slow diffusion at lower density precedes the observed core stage .",
    "turbulence accelerates ambipolar diffusion , however ( e.g. @xcite ) , so it is also possible that the flux loss needed to reach a magnetically supercritical state may occur more dynamically , at densities below @xmath19 .",
    "theoretical modeling of core evolution has a long history .",
    "much work has focused on the evolution of unstable thermally - supported equilibria into collapse ( formally resulting in infinite density at the origin ) , followed by accretion of the envelope .",
    "self - similar solutions for collapse and/or accretion stages of isothermal spheres were found by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; these were later generalized by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( hereafter lp ) independently found self - similar solutions which describe the density and velocity prior to the instant of protostar formation ( defined as the instant at which the central density become infinite ) . in the lp solution ,",
    "the radial velocity approaches a constant value @xmath20 and the density approaches @xmath21 at the instant of central protostar formation , with mass inflow rate @xmath22 .",
    "here , @xmath1 is the isothermal sound speed , and the dimensional factor in the accretion rate is given by @xmath23 the analysis of @xcite showed that for an initial profile that is a static singular isothermal sphere , @xmath24 , evolution yields an `` inside - out '' infall solution in which a wave of rarefaction propagates outward at the sound speed .",
    "inside of the expansion wave , the mass inflow rate is @xmath25 independent of @xmath26 , and gas accelerates to free - fall ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "@xcite connected and extended the investigations of lp ( which address evolution prior to protostar formation ) with that of shu ( which focuses on the accretion stage ) .",
    "he showed that self - similar solutions before and after the point of singularity formation ( i.e. @xmath29 ) can be smoothly matched .",
    "this allowed the lp solution to be extended into the accretion phase with similar free - fall behavior near the origin ; @xcite also found a sequence of self - similar solutions valid for all time that approach the @xcite expansion wave solution .",
    "many numerical simulations of isothermal collapse have shown that the density in the core approaches a @xmath30 profile at the point of protostar formation , regardless of how collapse is initiated @xcite .",
    "these simulations include initiation from a static configuration that is unstable , and initiation from static , stable configurations that are subjected to transient compression , either from enhanced external pressure or a converging velocity field .",
    "another feature common to the results from simulations is that the collapse generally begins on the outside , with the infalling region propagating inward as the central density increases . at the time of singularity formation",
    ", the central velocity has been found to be comparable to the value @xmath31 derived by lp , with the density normalization also similar to the lp result @xcite . following the instant of protostar formation",
    ", the evolution of the mass accretion rate over time depends strongly on the initial conditions , however .",
    "simulations with triggered core collapse @xcite are motivated by the fact that star - forming regions are highly dynamic , such that external compression may significantly affect core internal evolution , and enhance the accretion rate by raising the central density .",
    "triggering events may be associated with high mass star formation , but even without these highly energetic events , the large - scale turbulence that pervades giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) can compress initially - quiescent cores .",
    "taking this idea one step further , it is interesting to consider not just the core collapse process , but also the core formation process , in a strongly turbulent medium .",
    "@xcite conducted one such study , considering how an impulsive converging velocity field can create gravitationally bound , centrally - concentrated cores .",
    "core formation induced by supersonic turbulence has also been studied in a number of numerical simulations that focus on the large scales , with much of the emphasis on determining the distribution of core masses for comparison to observed core mass functions and the stellar imf ( see e.g. the review of @xcite ) . however , these studies have not had sufficient resolution to investigate the internal properties of the cores that form .",
    "if the mass of a core is built up over time as the post - shock product of colliding supersonic flows , what is the detailed evolution leading up to collapse , and during the accretion phase ?    in this paper , we initiate a study of dynamically - induced core formation and collapse by considering perhaps the simplest possible situation : a supersonic , converging , spherical flow .",
    "our initial conditions are a uniform low - density medium with no stratification .",
    "a dense core forms inside a spherical shock , and over time becomes stratified as its mass grows and it becomes self - gravitating .",
    "when the stratification becomes too great , collapse and subsequent accretion occurs in a similar manner to the case of an initially - unstable static equilibrium .",
    "we consider cases of varying inflow mach number , and with the large - scale inflow either steady over all time , or shut off after an interval .    the condition of spherical inflow that we adopt for this first study is , of course , likely to be rare in real clouds . as the main purpose of this study is to take the first step towards unified models of core formation and collapse in dynamic environments ,",
    "however , we consider one - dimensional solutions the natural place to start",
    ". we shall show that many features consistent with observed cores are evident even in these idealized models , suggesting that they are generic to dynamic core formation scenarios .",
    "the present set of simulations , in addition to enabling identification of characteristic evolutionary stages , also serve as a useful reference point for more realistic but more complex simulations . more typical than a converging spherical flow",
    "would be a converging planar flow , which yields a dense post - shock stagnation layer in which self - gravitating cores can form .",
    "numerical studies that we have begun for supersonic planar inflows show results for core building and collapse that are qualitative similar to the present results for supersonic spherical inflows .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in  2 we present the governing equations and describe our problem specification and numerical method .",
    "section 3 briefly describes results of collapse initiated from static configurations , demonstrating that we reproduce prior results , and providing a baseline for comparison to our models of dynamic formation and collapse .",
    "section 4 presents numerical results for our converging - flow simulations , covering the stage of core formation and evolution up to the point of singularity formation in  4.1 and the subsequent stages in stages in  4.2 .",
    "we introduce a breakdown into new physically - defined stages in  4.3 , and quantify the evolution of accretion rates in  4.4 .",
    "section 5 summarizes our new results and discusses our findings in the context of previous theory and observations .",
    "the equations of motion for a spherically symmetric flow take the form : @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass within radius @xmath26 defined by @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the radial velocity , @xmath37 is the gas pressure , and @xmath38 is the density . for prestellar collapse , an isothermal equation of state @xmath39 is often used , because cooling is so efficient that the gas remains at nearly constant temperature during the gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "we adopt an isothermal equation of state .    for ease of comparison with previous work ,",
    "we introduce the following dimensionless variables : @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 here @xmath45 is a fiducial density representing the volume - averaged ambient density in a cloud on large scales , which we shall later set to the uniform density of the converging flow . the unit of velocity is the isothermal sound speed @xmath46 the unit of time is related to the free - fall time at the fiducial density by @xmath47 the unit of length is related to the jeans length at the fiducial density @xmath48 by @xmath49 and the corresponding basic unit of mass is @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "the mass unit adopted in equation ( [ m_def ] ) is larger than this by a factor @xmath51 : @xmath52    with the dimensionless variables , the fluid equations become @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55    we solve the 1d hydrodynamic equations ( [ cont_dim_eq])-([mass_dim_eq ] ) with the zeus-2d @xcite code , in spherical symmetry . during the evolution to singularity formation ( collapse phase ) , we adopt an inner reflecting boundary condition . for the post - collapse accretion phase ,",
    "we implement a sink cell @xcite at the origin when the central density reaches a reference value .",
    "subsequently , the inner boundary condition is changed to outflow , and the value of the central point mass is tracked via the integrated flow off the grid , with @xmath56 .",
    "the sink cell is only implemented after the inflow in the central region become supersonic , so that information from the inner boundary can not propagate into the remainder of the grid .",
    "as discussed in  1 , many previous numerical simulations of core evolution have adopted static initial conditions and a fixed total mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the adopted initial density profile shapes are consistent with ( or similar to ) a hydrostatic equilibrium , i.e. a be sphere , with the initial density perturbed above the value that can be supported by the internal pressure in order to initiate collapse .",
    "these fixed - mass simulations adopt a prescribed external pressure at a low density with an effectively lagrangian outer boundary @xcite , or else a fixed outer boundary with prescribed external pressure and no mass inflow @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored both types of boundary conditions , and found very similar results for a given initial cloud density profile .",
    "they concluded that the evolution for the fixed - mass case is insensitive to the outer boundary condition for initially - unstable equilibria .",
    "this is consistent with the argument of @xcite that the outer boundary condition does not affect evolution up to collapse as long as the free - fall time ( eq . [ tff_eq ] ) is shorter than the cloud crossing time .",
    "the ratio of the free - fall time at the mean density to the sound crossing time @xmath57 over the radius of a be sphere is @xmath58 , which approaches @xmath59 as @xmath60 approaches infinity . here , @xmath61 , the dimensionless gravitational potential .",
    "for the critical case , the free - fall time is 0.71 times the sound crossing time over the radius .    for comparison to previous work , we consider collapse of an initially - static be sphere . for initial conditions , we adopt a critical be sphere , i.e. the outer boundary of the grid is at radius @xmath62 corresponding to dimensionless outer radius @xmath63 . here",
    ", @xmath64 is the total core mass divided by its volume .",
    "the mass of the critical be sphere is @xmath65 to initiate collapse , density is perturbed above the equilibrium value by @xmath66 .",
    "our outer boundary condition is at a fixed pressure , with no inflow .",
    "the temporal evolution of the accretion rate for this model is shown in figure [ fig : mfl_pre ] .",
    "features similar to those outlined by @xcite are observed in our simulation .",
    "the accretion rate peaks at a value approaching the lp prediction at the instant when the central density ( formally ) becomes infinite , and steeply decreases thereafter .",
    "@xcite find that the decline in the accretion rate after singularity formation ( unlike the increase in the accretion rate in hunter s self - similar extension of the lp solution ) can be attributed to the variation of velocity with radius in the sphere as it evolves toward collapse .",
    "we also considered cases of much larger initial static spheres , with outer boundaries @xmath67 corresponding to highly - unstable be configurations .",
    "for these cases , the accretion rate decreases until it reaches a plateau at @xmath68 , consistent with the value reported in @xcite ( when the density is 10% greater than for hydrostatic equilibrium ) , and then further declines to zero after a rarefaction wave propagates inward from the outer boundary to reach the center .",
    "similar to the results of previous simulations , we find that the first collapse is `` outside - in , '' with velocities initially nonzero only in the outer parts where the imbalance between gravity and pressure is largest .",
    ", as was previously shown by @xcite .",
    "] this is because the inner portions of the sphere , at @xmath69 , initially are equivalent to _ stable _ be solutions . in all of our models initiated from static spheres ,",
    "the density profile approaches the lp self - similar solution @xmath70 , and the velocity in the inner region approaches @xmath20 , at the moment of singularity formation . before this time",
    ", the density profile in the central region is flat with a magnitude that increases over time .",
    "the process can be thought of as a wave of compression propagating from the outside to the inside , creating a density distribution in which the ratio of radius to the jeans length at the local density is everywhere constant : @xmath71 .",
    "the singularity represents the instant the compression wave converges at the center .",
    "supersonic inflow velocities can be achieved without shock formation in the interior of the core ( except at @xmath72 ) because inward acceleration occurs at all radii where the inward gravitational force exceeds the outward pressure force . by construction ,",
    "the solutions initiated from static configurations all have gravity ( slightly ) exceeding pressure forces everywhere in the initial state , so that the inward acceleration is nonzero . after a singularity forms at the center ,",
    "accretion begins , and the flow in the interior transitions from the @xmath73 , @xmath74 lp solution to a free - fall solution , with the accreting region propagating from the interior to the exterior in a manner similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "thus , while collapse develops in an `` outside - in '' fashion , accretion develops in an `` inside - out '' fashion . note that accretion in any centrally - concentrated configuration should work its way outward from the center , because gravitational collapse times decline outwards @xmath75 , which is @xmath76 for an inverse - square density profile ( true for either the lp profile or the singular isothermal sphere )",
    "in this section , we present the results of our simulations of core formation and evolution for the case of converging spherical , supersonic flows . for these simulations , the outer boundary condition at @xmath77",
    "is maintained at a constant density and inflow velocity .",
    "the inflow velocity is characterized by the mach number relative to the isothermal sound speed , @xmath78 .",
    "we vary @xmath79 over the range from 1.05 to 7 .",
    "for some models ( see below ) , we suppress inflow at the outer radius after collapse occurs to test how the late - time accretion rate is altered .",
    "the initial conditions consist of uniform ( low ) density , and uniform inflow velocity equal to the value at the outer boundary .",
    "the size of the grid , in terms of the reference length scale given in equation ( [ r0_def ] ) , is @xmath80 , which amounts to a fraction 0.4 of the jeans length at the initial density .",
    "note that the radius of a critical be sphere at the same external pressure ( so that @xmath81 ) would be @xmath82 .",
    "that is , a critical be sphere confined by the same ambient pressure would be able to fit within our simulation domain , with plenty of room to spare .",
    "the size of zones in the radial direction has a constant logarithmic increment , i.e. , @xmath83 , for some @xmath84 , such that @xmath85\\delta r_1 $ ] and @xmath86^{-1}$ ] .",
    "for all the converging flow simulations in this paper , @xmath87 is set to @xmath88 ; 605 and 597 grids are used during the collapse phase and accretion phase respectively .",
    "we begin with a description of the core formation process , which is similar for all of the converging - flow models . because of the reflecting boundary condition at the center and the initial inflow velocities , immediately after we initiate the simulation , a shock forms at the origin and propagates outward .",
    "the inflowing matter is compressed by the shock .",
    "the shock front divides the converging inflow into two regions : an inner dense post - shock region and an outer low - density region of supersonic inflow .",
    "these two regions evolve quasi - independently but are connected by shock jump conditions . under competition between gas pressure and self - gravity , the inner region contracts slowly to begin forming a dense core .",
    "as self - gravity starts to overwhelm gas pressure , the dense core enters the collapse phase .    at the beginning ,",
    "the inner region is quasi - hydrostatic , with the velocity a linear function of radius . with negligible density gradient and self - gravity in the early stages , equation ( [ mom_dim_eq ] )",
    "becomes @xmath89 this equation is satisfied by @xmath90 for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , i.e. the coefficient of the linear profile is constant in time .",
    "the leftmost lower panels of figures [ fig : be_shock_1.05 ] - [ fig : be_shock_7.0 ] show this linear - velocity behavior in the shocked region , at the time that equals half of the collapse time @xmath93 . throughout this paper , we define the collapse time @xmath93 as the moment that @xmath94 . shown in the leftmost",
    "upper panels of figures [ fig : be_shock_1.05 ] - [ fig : be_shock_7.0 ] are the density profiles ; even when the density profile has nonzero gradients , the velocity in the inner region is dominated by the linear term . notice that the leftmost panels have linear - linear scales .",
    "the velocity over the whole post - shock region is subsonic and negative , which means the core is slowly contracting . for the @xmath95 models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : be_shock_4.0 ] , [ fig : be_shock_7.0 ] ) , the inner part of the density and velocity profiles oscillate at the beginning of simulations .",
    "as the shock front propagates outward , the mass inside the shock increases , and so does self - gravity . after a period of accumulation lasting about 90% of the time until collapse @xmath93 , the slowly - contracting dense region starts to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "note that the density and velocity profiles of the regions outside of the shock go through a transient evolution after simulations begin .",
    "the density profile evolves from a uniform profile set in the initial condition to a @xmath96 profile consistent with supersonic radial inflow upstream of the shock combines with the steady state mass inflow condition @xmath97 to yield @xmath96 . ] ; the material is also increasingly accelerated by gravity . in figures [ fig : be_shock_1.05 ] - [ fig : be_shock_7.0 ] , the inflection feature in the velocity profiles exterior to the shock corresponds to a wave propagating inward at a speed equal to the inflow speed plus the sound speed .",
    "since post - shock velocities are subsonic , gravitational instability is expected to develop at a point when the radius of the inner dense post - shock region becomes comparable to the critical radius of a be sphere .",
    "this expectation is indeed borne out by our simulations , which moreover show that the properties of the collapsing dense inner region are similar as those of collapsing cores initialized from hydrostatic be spheres .",
    "the collapse follows an `` outside - in '' pattern , starting from the shock front .",
    "the central density increases dramatically and the inflow velocity inside the shock becomes supersonic .",
    "the collapse propagates inward and establishes a centrally - concentrated density profile @xcite , which approaches the lp density profile @xmath98 , and the velocity approaches @xmath99 .",
    "the three panels on the right of figures [ fig : be_shock_1.05 ] - [ fig : be_shock_7.0 ] show the density profile ( top ) and the velocity profile ( bottom ) at three different instants during the outside - in collapse .",
    "the density profiles plotted are normalized by the central density and the interior regions are fit by be sphere density profiles . with a fitted temperature @xmath100 .",
    "these fits are further discussed below . ]",
    "the ratio between the fitted be sphere temperature @xmath100 and the true temperature @xmath101 is also noted in the figures .",
    "the first figure of these three shows profiles at the instant when the radius of the post - shock region reaches the critical radius ( see eq .",
    "[ radiusbe ] ) of a be sphere at temperature @xmath101 with the same central density i.e. @xmath102 .",
    "we define the period after this as the supercritical regime",
    ". the center - to - edge density ratio after this point exceeds @xmath103 .",
    "the second figure of these three shows the instant when the radius of the post - shock region reaches twice the critical radius of a be sphere .",
    "the third figure is at the instant the core collapse @xmath93 ( defined here as @xmath104 ) . the long dashed diagonal line in the third figure shows the lp density profile , which is very close to the numerical solution .",
    "the time interval between @xmath105 and collapse for the @xmath106 case in code units is 0.048 ( see eq .",
    "[ t0_def ] ) , which corresponds to @xmath107 if the inflowing ambient medium s density is @xmath108 .",
    "we note that prior to collapse , the velocities in the dense gas ( inside the shock ) remain small .",
    "in particular , for @xmath109 cases , the inflow velocity inside the shock is subsonic throughout the post - shock region before the time when @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath79 is high , figures [ fig : be_shock_4.0 ] and [ fig : be_shock_7.0 ] show that the post - shock velocities remain subsonic up to the instant of collapse .    the outward propagation speed of the shock , which from the simulations is approximately constant ( fig .",

    "the intercept and the slope are based on the best fit of the linear part where @xmath124 [ 0.0 , 0.04 ] .",

    "the analytical approximation is about 15 - 28% below the measured value from the simulations as @xmath79 ranges from 1.05 - 7.0 .    using the constant - shock - speed approximation ,",

    "because of the radial convergence of the inflow in the simulations , @xmath131 varies ; it is initially equal to @xmath132 , but after an initial transient , in the highly - supersonic limit @xmath131 would approach @xmath133 because of mass conservation .",
    "it is interesting to investigate how the state of the core when it collapses depends on mach number .",
    "figure [ fig : rho_v_collapse ] shows the density profiles and the velocity profiles of the simulated cores at the instant of collapse @xmath93 , for different mach numbers .",
    "firstly , it is clear that all the density profiles approach the lp solution , especially for low mach number cases .",
    "the inflow velocity inside the shock is supersonic and does not strongly vary over the dense core region .",
    "the smaller the mach number is , the closer the inflow speed is to the lp result , @xmath134 .",
    "secondly , the radius of the core at the instant of collapse decreases as mach number increases .",
    "we plot this dependence in figure [ fig : u_xi_tau_ori ] with diamonds .",
    "we quantitatively compare the basic core properties in figure [ fig : u_xi_tau_ori ] , which shows the collapse time @xmath93 and the shock radius @xmath135 at time @xmath93 , both as function of @xmath79 .",
    "as noted above , @xmath135 decreases with increasing @xmath79 ; the same is true for @xmath93 .",
    "we also recall that @xmath125 decreases with @xmath79 .",
    "interestingly , while @xmath136 , and @xmath93 all decrease with @xmath79 , the ratio @xmath137 is nearly constant with @xmath79 : it ranges only from 0.34 to 0.42 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : u_xi_tau_ori ] ) .",
    "this result is potentially useful for empirical estimates of core lifetimes , since the inflow velocity @xmath79 , the isothermal sound speed @xmath1 and the radius of dense core are all in principle measurable .",
    "if the ratio @xmath137 is taken as a constant @xmath138 , and the shock speed is estimated via equation ( [ eq : ush ] ) , then the life time of cores up to the point of collapse is given in dimensional form by @xmath139/a$ ] . in practice",
    ", it may be difficult to measure @xmath79 outside of a core , because the density is much lower than that of the core , and it is difficult to isolate the immediate environment of the core from foreground and background gas .",

    "<S> we present a unified model for molecular core formation and evolution , based on numerical simulations of converging , supersonic flows . our model applies to star formation in gmcs dominated by large - scale turbulence , and contains four main stages : core building , core collapse , envelope infall , and late accretion . during the building stage , cores form out of dense , post - shock gas , and become increasingly centrally stratified as the mass grows over time . even for highly - supersonic converging flows , </S>",
