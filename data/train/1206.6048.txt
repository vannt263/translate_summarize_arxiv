    "the ground states of certain two - dimensional lattice hamiltonians of a type first introduced by kitaev@xcite can be used as quantum error - correcting codes known as surface codes .",
    "quantum information can be stored and protected using these codes when they are defined on lattices with holes ( defects).@xcite fault - tolerant gates can then be carried out either transversally or by deforming the code in order to braid these defects while staying entirely within the code subspace.@xcite one downside to using the kitaev surface codes , for which defects behave as abelian anyons , is that to realize a universal set of fault - tolerant gates at least one gate using a resource costly `` magic state '' distillation process@xcite is required . the same is true for fault - tolerant quantum computation using the so - called color codes.@xcite nevertheless , quantum computation using these surface codes has a number of appealing features , notably the need for only nearest - neighbor gates between qubits in a two - dimensional array and high error thresholds , e.g. @xmath2 for the kitaev surface code.@xcite    recently knig , kuperberg , and reichardt@xcite ( kkr ) outlined a method for fault - tolerant quantum computation using _ non - abelian _ surface codes .",
    "these codes , which are defined mathematically in terms of the turaev - viro topological invariants for 3-manifolds,@xcite can be viewed physically as ground states of levin - wen models,@xcite two - dimensional lattice models which generalize the kitaev model.@xcite these models can be used to realize so - called `` doubled '' versions of any consistent anyon theory , including theories of non - abelian anyons for which braiding is universal for quantum computation .",
    "the simplest such universal anyons are the fibonacci anyons . here",
    "we refer to the corresponding levin - wen model as the fibonacci levin - wen model and , following kkr,@xcite refer to the ground states of this model as the fibonacci code . as shown in ref .  , when using the fibonacci code , fibonacci anyons can be associated with holes in the lattice subject to certain boundary conditions and proper initialization .",
    "these fibonacci anyons can then be used to encode logical qubits and universal quantum computation can be carried out purely by braiding them,@xcite without the need for magic state distillation .",
    "the levin - wen models are defined by a set of commuting vertex and plaquette projection operators which act on qubits ( more generally , qudits ) associated with the edges of a two - dimensional trivalent lattice .",
    "when using the ground states of these models as quantum codes it will be necessary to continually measure these vertex and plaquette operators in order to check for errors , which would then have to be corrected without disturbing the quantum information stored in the topological degrees of freedom of the code .",
    "for the kitaev surface code , quantum circuits which can be used to measure these operators are known and are fairly straightforward.@xcite for either an @xmath0-sided plaquette , or a vertex where @xmath0 edges meet , these measurement circuits each require a single initialized syndrome qubit which is measured after carrying out @xmath0 controlled - not ( cnot ) gates .",
    "the simplicity of the quantum circuits used to measure the vertex and plaquette operators for the kitaev surface code reflects the abelian nature of this code .",
    "it is natural to ask how complex the quantum circuits need to be to measure the vertex and plaquette operators for the non - abelian fibonacci code . in this paper",
    "we present explicit quantum circuits for performing such measurements .",
    "these circuits are built in part out of smaller circuits which carry out unitary transformations which have been described both in kkr@xcite and , in the context of entanglement renormalization , in ref .  .",
    "our goal here is to explicitly construct these circuits in terms of standard elements ( toffoli gates , cnot gates and single - qubit rotations ) in an attempt to quantify their complexity .",
    "the purpose of this work is not to argue that non - abelian surface codes are viable competitors to the kitaev surface code .",
    "indeed , we share the view of many in the field that quantum computation using the kitaev surface code , given its clear advantages over other fault - tolerant quantum computation schemes , may well provide the best practical route to building a functioning quantum computer.@xcite here our goal is the more modest one of making a first pass at determining the complexity of syndrome extraction for the significantly less well understood fibonacci code , which we believe is of intrinsic interest in its own right .",
    "an additional goal of this work is to begin developing a  dictionary \" for translating the mathematical structures which appear in general anyon theories into interesting quantum circuits , some of which we find require only a few qubits and might feasibly be carried out experimentally in the near future .",

    "there are only two labels @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the edges are unoriented ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) .",

    "for the fibonacci code this means that these defects can encode two types of fibonacci anyons with opposite chiralities .",

    "accurate three - qubit toffoli - class gates have recently been been carried out experimentally using superconducting qubits@xcite and trapped ions.@xcite motivated by this , we take one primitive gate set to consist of three - qubit toffoli gates , cnot gates and single - qubit rotations .",
    "an @xmath0-qubit toffoli gate can then be carried out using @xmath40 three - qubit toffoli gates if @xmath41 additional qubits are available.@xcite these additional qubits need not be initialized and their states are left unchanged once the full @xmath0-qubit toffoli gate is carried out .",

    "this count gives @xmath42 toffoli gates .",
    "the total gate count for our @xmath13 circuit is then 4 toffoli gates and 3 cnot gates .",
    "this can be contrasted with the analogous circuit for the kitaev surface code which , when acting on a trivalent vertex , would require only 3 cnot gates ( it is , in fact , identical to the circuit shown in fig .",

    "the qubits ( open circles ) are arranged in a kagome lattice and lie on the edges of an initial trivalent ( hexagonal ) lattice .",

    "we turn to the more difficult problem of measuring the plaquette operator @xmath14 . for this case a brute force approach to constructing a circuit which measures the appropriate operator acting on the edges of a plaquette for each possible state of the edges connected to that plaquette is problematic .",
    "fortunately , there is a useful resource which simplifies the problem greatly  the @xmath32-move .",
    "when using the fibonacci code , the physical qubits of a quantum computer may be fixed in space and may even form a rigid lattice . however , this physical lattice need not be the same as that formed by the edges of the abstract trivalent lattice used to define the code .",
    "indeed , as emphasized in kkr,@xcite this abstract trivalent lattice should be thought of as fluid and constantly changing throughout the computation .",
    "these changes are accomplished by carrying out @xmath32-moves , processes which locally redraw the trivalent lattice while reassigning the physical qubits to new lattice edges and carrying out an appropriate unitary operation .",

    "[ f_lattice](a ) contingent on the states of the other four qubits ( labeled @xmath46 ) .",
    "the usefulness of the @xmath32-move here derives from the fact that if one starts in a ground state of a given levin - wen model on a particular trivalent lattice then , after performing an @xmath32-move , the resulting state will be a ground state of the new levin - wen model defined on the new trivalent lattice.@xcite this is true even though this lattice has decoupled from the physical qubits , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the notation is the same as in the pentagon circuit , with each box corresponding to either the full or reduced @xmath32 circuit , or the @xmath64 circuit , and the letters labeling the various `` inputs '' as defined in figs .",
    "[ f],[fprime ] , and [ s ] . from the structure of the circuit",
    "it is clear how this construction generalizes to the case of an arbitrary @xmath0-sided plaquette .",
    "we again emphasize that the circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ bp ] only measures @xmath14 correctly if the vertex constraint @xmath35 is satisfied on each vertex of the initial plaquette at the start of the circuit .",
    "if the vertex constraint is violated on any of these vertices then by definition @xmath69 for the plaquette;@xcite but the circuit will , in some cases , give the wrong result of @xmath36 . to see this , consider the action of this circuit on the full @xmath85-dimensional hilbert space of the @xmath24 qubits associated with an @xmath0-sided plaquette , including those states which violate the vertex constraint .",
    "from the structure of the circuit , which performs a unitary transformation on @xmath24 qubits and then measures the state of a single qubit to determine @xmath14 , it is clear that the dimensionalities of the hilbert spaces for which @xmath36 or @xmath69 would both be @xmath86 , i.e. half that of the full hilbert space .",

    "this means the full @xmath95 dimensional hilbert space of twelve qubits is projected down to a space of dimensionality @xmath96 with an 89 dimensional space of states satisfying the plaquette constraint with @xmath36 . the reader will be reassured to know we have numerically checked that the circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ bp ] performs the correct measurement of @xmath14 on this projected space .",
    "it should be noted that the requirement that @xmath35 on each vertex before measuring @xmath14 may cause problems when extracting error syndromes .",
    "for example , if a faulty measurement of @xmath13 gives 1 for a particular vertex on a plaquette , but the actual value of @xmath13 is 0 for that vertex , then , as described above , the @xmath14 measurement circuit for the plaquette will , in some cases , give @xmath36 even though the correct value ( as it is for any plaquette in which a vertex constraint is violated ) is @xmath69 . in this paper",
    "we have not addressed the important question of whether it is possible to extract error syndromes for the fibonacci code fault tolerantly , nor the question of precisely how these errors would be corrected .",
    "our goal has been to construct circuits which , in the absence of errors , can be used to measure @xmath13 and @xmath14 in order to begin to get a measure of their complexity .",
    "we can now give our final gate counts for measuring @xmath14 . if we choose to reduce all @xmath0-qubit toffoli gates to conventional three - qubit toffoli gates ( using @xmath97 toffoli gates , following ref .",
    "as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : qv ] ) then we find that our procedure for an @xmath0-sided plaquette ( with @xmath98 ) requires @xmath99 toffoli gates , @xmath100 cnot gates and @xmath101 single - qubit rotations . alternatively ,",
    "if we consider @xmath0-qubit toffoli gates as primitives , then our procedure requires @xmath102 five - qubit toffoli gates , 2 four - qubit toffoli gates , @xmath103 toffoli gates , @xmath100 cnot gates and @xmath101 single - qubit rotations.@xcite not surprisingly , this is significantly more demanding than the analogous requirement for the kitaev surface code , for which only @xmath0 cnot gates are needed to measure the plaquette operator for an @xmath0-sided plaquette .",
    "finally we note that there are , of course , many different ways to reduce a given plaquette to a tadpole using @xmath32-moves , all of which can be used to measure @xmath14 and some of which will be more `` parallelizable '' than others .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work is to find simple quantum circuits which might feasibly be carried out in the near term and which begin to test some of the key properties of the fibonacci code .",
    "we have already seen one example of such a circuit , the sequence of five controlled-@xmath32 gates which results in a two - qubit swap gate discussed in sec .",

    "this circuit is a simplified version of the full seven - qubit pentagon circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ pentagon](b ) and can potentially be used to calibrate the @xmath32 operation . in this section",
    "we give a similar example  a four - qubit circuit which first initializes a tadpole into a state with either @xmath36 or @xmath6 , and then pulls this tadpole through a line using @xmath32-moves to produce a new tadpole which can be measured to verify that the value of @xmath14 has not changed . as for the pentagon circuit",
    ", this four - qubit circuit can be simplified to a two - qubit circuit which , in this case , can be used to calibrate the @xmath64 operation .",
    "the sequence of operations we consider is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sf_circuit](a ) .",
    "the system consists of a four - edged trivalent lattice and so uses four qubits , labeled 1 through 4 in the figure .",
    "initially two qubits ( 1 and 2 ) are assigned to edges which form a line and the other two qubits ( 3 and 4 ) form a tadpole attached to this line . as always , in what follows we assume that it has been verified that @xmath35 on each of the two vertices of this lattice at the start of the process .",
    "the first step is to initialize the tadpole in a state with either @xmath36 or @xmath6 .",
    "then , using two @xmath32-moves , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sf_circuit](a ) , the tadpole can be pulled through the line .",
    "the @xmath32-moves preserve @xmath14 , and so the intermediate state of this process is a 2-sided plaquette which has been initialized either into the code space if @xmath36 or outside of the code space if @xmath69 . after the tadpole has been pulled through the line , the two qubits forming the initial tadpole have swapped places  the head of the tadpole is now the tail and vice versa . if @xmath14 is now measured for the new tadpole the result should yield the same value of @xmath14 that the tadpole was initialized to at the start of the process .",
    "the left - hand side of the circuit identity shown in figure [ sf_circuit](b ) is a four - qubit circuit which carries out the procedure described above .",
    "if qubit 4 is initially in the state @xmath104 then the first @xmath64 circuit initializes the tadpole in a state with @xmath105 .",
    "a reduced @xmath32 circuit then carries out the first @xmath32-move and produces a 2-sided plaquette with @xmath105 .",
    "next , a second reduced @xmath32 circuit carries out the second @xmath32-move producing a new tadpole with @xmath106 but with the head and tail of the tadpole interchanged .",
    "finally , after carrying out an @xmath64 circuit on this tadpole the state of qubit 3 will be @xmath104 .",
    "note that if qubit 4 is initially in the state @xmath11 so that the tadpole is initialized to a state with @xmath107 then qubit 3 can initially be in either the state @xmath10 or @xmath11 while still satisfying the vertex constraint .",
    "after the first @xmath64 circuit on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ sf_circuit](b ) is carried out the tadpole will then be placed in a quantum superposition of @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( see eqns .",
    "( [ bp2 ] ) and ( [ bp3 ] ) ) . at the end of the circuit , after being pulled through the line formed by qubits 1 and 2 , the tadpole will still be in the two - dimensional @xmath69 hilbert space , but the particular superposition will in general have changed .",
    "direct calculation shows that if qubits 1 and 2 are both in the state @xmath11 then the operation acting on the two - dimensional @xmath110 space when pulling the tadpole through the line is given by @xmath111 otherwise , if either qubit 1 or qubit 2 ( or both ) are in the state @xmath10 the state of the final tadpole will be the same as that of the initial tadpole with the head and tail qubits swapped .",
    "these cases are all accounted for by the swap gate and four - qubit controlled-@xmath112 operation on the right - hand side of the circuit identity in fig .",
    "[ sf_circuit](b ) . as for the pentagon circuit ,",
    "this identity only holds when @xmath35 on the two vertices of the initial lattice ( again these vertices are labeled inside the red box in the figure ) .     in the circuit identity shown in fig .",

    "( b ) equivalent circuit identity obtained by moving the two not gates from the left side of the identity shown in ( a ) to the right side . ]",
    "this four - qubit circuit , which essentially represents initializing a 2-sided plaquette into a state with a given value of @xmath14 and then producing a state which can be measured to determine @xmath14 after carrying out a different @xmath32-move than the one used to initialize it , is much simpler than the full circuit for measuring @xmath14 for a hexagonal plaquette .",
    "however , it still involves the four - qubit toffoli gate which appear in the reduced @xmath32 circuit .",
    "as for the pentagon circuit , a simpler two - qubit circuit identity can be found by fixing the states of the qubits which act effectively as control qubits ( qubits 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ sf_circuit ] ) . if we fix these qubits to both be in the state @xmath11 we obtain the simplified two - qubit circuit identity shown in fig .",
    "[ sf_simple](a ) .",
    "this circuit identity can be simplified further by multiplying both sides on the left and right by not gates which act on the top and bottom qubits , respectively , to obtain the equivalent circuit identity shown in fig .",
    "[ sf_simple](b ) .",
    "note that if the initial state for the circuit shown in fig .",
    "[ sf_simple](a ) is @xmath113 , where the first qubit is the top qubit ( qubit 3 in fig .",
    "[ sf_circuit ] ) , then the vertex constraint is not satisfied for the full four - qubit circuit .",
    "however , the simplified circuit identity is readily seen to be satisfied in this case . for all other cases",
    "the vertex constraint is satisfied , and so it follows that the expression shown in fig .  [ sf_simple](a ) and the equivalent expression in fig .",
    "[ sf_simple](b ) are exact circuit identities , independent of whether or not the vertex constraint is satisfied .",
    "the key action of the two - qubit circuit on the left - hand side of fig .  [ sf_simple](b ) occurs when the tadpole is initialized in a state with @xmath36 for which the tail qubit must start in the state @xmath10 . for this case , after pulling the tadpole through the line the new tadpole must again be in the state with @xmath36 .",
    "thus , after accounting for the removal of the two not gates , this circuit must take the state @xmath114 to the state @xmath115 .",
    "like the five controlled-@xmath32 swap circuit in fig .",
    "[ pentagon_simple ] , which can be used to calibrate the @xmath32 matrix , the circuit identity shown in fig .",

    "[ sf_simple](b ) takes the state @xmath113 to the state @xmath115 fixes the form of the matrix @xmath64 ( up to an overall phase which is irrelevant for our purposes ) .",
    "note that in performing this calibration it is not necessary to carry out a full quantum process tomography .",
    "it is sufficient to verify that the circuit identity holds for the initial state @xmath113 . for this case",
    ", only the swap gate on the right - hand side is relevant since the controlled-@xmath116 gate enters only when the initial state of the second qubit is @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we have constructed explicit quantum circuits for measuring the vertex and plaquette operators , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , in the fibonacci levin - wen model .",
    "these operators can be viewed as stabilizers for the fibonacci code,@xcite a surface code for which defects can behave as fibonacci anyons  the simplest non - abelian anyons for which braiding alone is universal for quantum computation . while the @xmath13 measurement is not significantly more difficult than the analogous measurement for the kitaev surface codes ( for which the defects behave as abelian anyons ) , the @xmath14 measurement scheme we present here _ is _ significantly more difficult than its abelian counterpart . while the present scheme is almost certainly not the most efficient one for performing this measurement , given the complexity of the operator @xmath14 it is likely that even the most efficient schemes will require a large number of primitive gate operations .",
    "this cost in circuit complexity will then need to be weighed against the gain of not requiring magic state distillation .",
    "the situation is somewhat analogous to comparing the relative merits of performing topological quantum computation with ising anyons ( which requires magic state distillation ) to fibonacci anyons.@xcite    it is clear that further work will be needed before such a direct comparison of the resources needed to carry out fault - tolerant quantum computation using the fibonacci code with that using the kitaev surface code will be possible .",
    "while recent progress strongly suggests that the kitaev surface code is the most promising from the practical point of view of trying to build an actual fault - tolerant quantum computer , we believe it is too early to rule out the possibility that the fibonacci code may have some practical implications . even if it does not , we believe the fibonacci code is of intrinsic interest , in part because computing with it can be viewed as essentially simulating a non - abelian state of matter on a quantum computer .",
