    "cause the system to return to the normal state at the orbital - limited upper critical field @xmath0 .",
    "if , however , the dominant coupling of spin - singlet superconducting electrons to the field is via the zeeman effect , the transition occurs at the pauli - limited field @xmath1 where the condensation energy equals the gain in energy due to spin polarization of the two electrons in a cooper pair .",
    "in addition , in pure systems in the vicinity of this field , the superconducting state can exhibit spatial - modulation of the type predicted by fulde and ferrell , and larkin and ovchinnikov ( fflo ) at low temperature and high magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "no clear examples of fflo superconductivity have been found ; however , early experiments @xcite on the layered@xcite , heavy - fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath2 , tentatively identified the low - temperature , high - field ( lthf ) superconducting phase as a possible realization of the fflo state .",
    "the heavy mass and large value of the ratio between the estimated orbital critical field and the pauli - limiting field @xmath3 , @xcite suggest strong paramagnetic limiting .",
    "it was also proposed that the unusual field dependence of the vortex lattice form factor of cecoin@xmath2 is due to pauli - limiting effects@xcite .",
    "some experimental features of the transition into the lthf phase are not fit by the established theories of pauli - limiting . for example , it has been established experimentally@xcite that the transition from the normal ( n ) to superconducting ( sc ) state in cecoin@xmath2 is first order into low - field state ( @xmath4 ) , and remains first order at low temperatures up to @xmath5 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the conventional theory in two dimensions ( 2d ) that finds a second order n - sc transition along the entire critical field line @xmath6 @xcite , and motivates our current study .    under purely zeeman field , @xmath7 ,",
    "when the electron spins couple to the field but the orbital coupling to the vector potential is irrelevant , at low temperatures the n - sc transition is into an inhomogeneous state @xcite . in most cases",
    "the amplitude modulated state , @xmath8 ( lo state ) , is favored compared to the purely phase - modulated ff state , @xmath9 . in the conventional analysis for isotropic , @xmath10-wave , superconductors the fflo transition is 2nd order in 2d and 1st order in 3d @xcite . in superconductors with nodes , such as @xmath11-wave cecoin@xmath2@xcite , the fflo transition is 2nd order in both 2d@xcite and 3d@xcite .",
    "the transition to a combined vortex and lo state is also expected to be second order @xcite .    theoretically , under several conditions",
    "the transition from the normal to the sc state may become first order . for purely zeeman coupling this can happen a ) due to strong fermi - liquid enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility  @xcite , or b ) due to impurity scattering in the resonant limit @xcite . in the presence of both paramagnetic and orbital effects it was argued in refs .",
    "[ ] that the transition may also become first order in an intermediate temperature range .    in this paper",
    "we show that in systems with enhanced magnetic susceptibility ( as compared to the dimensionless pauli susceptibility for typical metals @xmath12 ) , such as some heavy fermion materials , first order n - sc transitions under purely zeeman magnetic field may naturally emerge over a part of the phase diagram .",
    "importantly , the transition is first order both for the uniform and for the fflo state over part of the temperature range .",
    "we consider the critical field @xmath6 and discuss how the magnetic fluctuations affect the order and thermodynamics of the transition .",
    "the rationale for inclusion of such fluctuations is as follows .",
    "experiments convincingly show that cecoin@xmath2 is in proximity to a magnetically ordered state@xcite . in cecoin@xmath2",
    "the @xmath13-electron spins are not fully kondo screened by the onset of the superconducting order  @xcite , and the entropy of the remaining spin fluctuations is released at the superconducting transition@xcite .",
    "the specific heat jump upon entering the superconducting state at @xmath14 in zero field is @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the sommerfeld coeffient ) , more than three times the @xmath10-wave bcs value of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "guided by this observation , kos , martin , and varma @xcite considered a ginzburg - landau model of competition between thermal ( gaussian ) magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity , and were able to explain the large specific heat jump at @xmath18 .",
    "we employ similar methods , with more microscopic considerations , to include an applied magnetic field . to simplify our analysis , we consider only the zeeman coupling since it is largely responsible for the salient features in the phase diagram ( _ e.g. _ , the first order transition ) .",
    "we explain our results in context of experiment for cecoin@xmath2 and emphasize that our approach is generally applicable to pauli - limited systems with thermal magnetic fluctuations .",

    "iii we extend the formalism to account for the magnetic fluctuations , and use this method to obtain the results presented and discussed in sec .",

    "in the paramagnetic limit the second order transition into the uniform superconducting state , @xmath19 , becomes first order below a characteristic temperature @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the transition temperature in zero field @xcite . at @xmath22 superconductivity",
    "is destroyed when the energy of the polarized normal state equals the superconducting condensation energy ( the clogston@xcite - chandrasekhar@xcite limit ) .",
    "this occurs at the pauli field @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electron magnetic moment , @xmath25 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath26 is the conduction electron @xmath26-factor .",
    "the microscopic pairbreaking occurs as the zeeman field increases the energy of the spin - singlet with respect to spin - polarized @xmath27 .",
    "an alternative to this uniform superconductivity is the pairing of the electrons with opposite spins and the same energies , which now have momenta differing by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the finite center of mass momentum of the cooper pairs leads to a spatial modulation of the order parameter  @xcite and allows superconductivity to survive at fields above the clogston - chandrasekhar limit .",
    "the exact structure of the modulated state in @xmath10-wave systems is still not well established .",
    "generally the amplitude - modulated lo state is lower in energy than the current - carrying ff state  @xcite . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the direction of @xmath30 in real space can be chosen arbitrarily , and a superposition of plane wave modulations along different directions may yield yet lower energy  @xcite . in systems with unconventional , such as @xmath11-wave  @xcite , gap symmetry",
    "the modulation is preferentially along either the nodal or anti - nodal orientation , depending on both the temperature and the purity of the sample@xcite , with the lo state always more advantageous .",
    "analysis of the fflo states is often carried out within the ginzburg - landau theory , expanding the free energy of the superconducting state in both the amplitude and the gradient of the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "such an expansion is justified in the immediate vicinity of @xmath31 , but its region of validity is very narrow .",
    "the modulation wave vector increases rapidly along @xmath32 and becomes comparable to the inverse of the sc coherence length , @xmath33^{-1}$ ] , rendering the gradient expansion invalid .",

    "the results were suggestive of the onset of the first order transition near @xmath31",
    ". the limitations of the gradient expansion prevented us from reaching detailed conclusions , and motivated our present work .",
    "below we expand the free energy only in powers of the order parameter and retain the full wave - vector dependence of the expansion coefficients , thus removing the deficiencies of the gradient expansion and presenting a theory valid down to low temperatures .",
    "this allows us to analyze the details of the phase diagram not accessible with the gradient expansion .",
    "we begin with the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the orientation of the electron with the spin along / opposite to the field direction , @xmath36 is the band energy measured with respect to the chemical potential , and @xmath37 . in eq .",
