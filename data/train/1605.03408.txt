    "galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) are known to host star - to - star variations as far as chemical abundances are concerned .",
    "more specifically , @xcite showed that all ggcs studied up to now have at least a spread ( or anti - correlation ) in the content of their light - elements o and na .",
    "the only confirmed exception is ruprecht 106 , where @xcite found that stars share a homogenous chemical composition .",
    "this spread is probably due to the early evolution of each cluster , when a second generation of stars ( na - rich and o - poor ) was born from gas polluted by ejecta of evolved stars of the first generation ( na - poor and o - rich ) .",
    "this is the so called multiple - population phenomenon .",
    "@xcite showed also that most of the stars currently found in a gc belong to the second generation ( @xmath260@xmath380% ) .",
    "this is at odds with theory , which says that first generation stars must have been much more numerous than what we observe nowadays in order to produce enough ejecta to form the second @xcite .",
    "this contradiction can be partially explained if we assume that ejecta were collected preferentially in the center of the cluster due to the gravitational potential .",
    "because of this the second generation was formed in the center and was much less affected by the violent relaxation and the gas expulsion phase during the proto - cluster period @xcite or by galactic tidal disruption than the first , which lost most of its members @xcite .",
    "on the other hand @xcite suggested the possibility of the existence of clusters that retained almost all the first generation and so only a small fraction of the stars would belong to the second .",
    "an example of such a cluster is terzan 8 , where @xcite found that almost all stars belong to the first generation .    here",
    "we present an opposite case , the globular cluster ( gc ) ngc  4147 .",
    "this object has an horizontal branch ( hb ) that is mainly populated in the blue part .",
    "however it shows also the presence of a red tail . according to @xcite",
    ", this indicates that almost all its stars should belong to the second generation , with a fraction of first generation objects that should be very small , probably smaller than all the other ggcs studied up to now . in order to verify this statement we obtained spectroscopic data in the red giant branch ( rgb ) region with the aim of measuring their light - element content .",
    "we take advantage of these data also to perform a full chemical analysis of the cluster both to study the chemical trend of its multiple - populations and to compare it with different environments .",
    "this is because ngc  4147 , based on the projection on the sky of the theoretical orbit of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy computed by @xcite , was suggested to be a possible former member of the galaxy @xcite , like ngc  5053 and ngc  5634 , recently studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also found evidence for the presence of sgr tidal stream stars in the background of ngc4147 using 2mass data .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , used the spatial and kinematic data available for stars associated to the sgr tidal stream to construct numerical model of the tidal disruption of the galaxy .",
    "these authors considered the association of ngc4147 to sgr as still possible , but with a low statistical confidence .    in section 2",
    "we describe data reduction and in section 3 the methodology we used to obtain the chemical abundances . in section 4 we present our results including a comparison with different environments ( galactic and extragalactic ) . finally in section 5 we give a summary of our findings .

    "our dataset consists of medium and high resolution spectra collected at the giraffe ( mounted at the vlt - ut2 telescope ) and mike ( mounted at the magellan - clay telescope ) spectrograph respectively .",
    "targets were selected from the @xcite photometry .",
    "three targets were in common between the two datasets .",
    "we observed with giraffe a total of 17 rgb stars with magnitude between v=15.6 and v=18.0 .",
    "we used the set - up hr12 , that gives a spectral coverage between 5820 and 6140   with a resolution of r=18700 . the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) is between 25 and 70 at 6000  .",
    "data were reduced using the dedicated pipeline ( see http://www.eso.org/sci/software/pipelines/ ) .",
    "data reduction includes bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction , and spectral rectification .",
    "mike was used to observe 6 rgb stars with v magnitude between 14.7 and 15.6 .",
    "the spectrograph cover a wide spectral range , from the ultraviolet to the near infrared , with a resolution of r=32000 ( using a slit of 0.7 arcsec ) .",
    "the s / n of the spectra is between 70 and 90 at 6000  .",
    "data were reduced using iraf , including bias subtraction , flat - field correction , wavelength calibration , scattered - light and sky subtraction , and spectral rectification .",
    "radial velocities were measured by the _ fxcor _",
    "package in iraf , using a synthetic spectrum as a template .",
    "stars with very different radial velocity with respect to the median value were rejected as non - member .",
    "we rejected also two giraffe targets with a radial velocity similar to that of the cluster but with higher metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 1.60 ) .",
    "these two stars have low s / n and we could use only one out of the three iron lines available to measure [ fe / h ] ( see next section ) .",
    "so the disagreement in metallicity is probably due to the combination of the two factors .",
    "we end up with a sample of 12 giraffe and 6 mike targets .",
    "the mean radial velocity we obtained is 179.9@xmath00.5 km / s . @xcite and",
    "@xcite give 183.5@xmath01.3 and 183.2@xmath00.9 instead .",
    "however the first is based on one star only , while the second does not give any detail on the radial velocity measurements they perform so we can not suggest any reason for this discrepancy . if we compare the mean radial velocity obtained with the two instruments , we get 179.4@xmath00.5 for giraffe , and 180.7@xmath01.0 for mike ( errors on the mean ) .",

    "was derived by adopting the relation bc - t@xmath8 from @xcite .",

    "30@xmath340 fei and 8@xmath310 feii ( depending on the s / n of the spectrum ) were used for the latter purpose .",
    "the [ fe / h ] value of the model was changed at each iteration according to the output of the abundance analysis .",
    "for giraffe data we measured fe , na , ca and ba abundances .",
    "fe abundances were obtained from the equivalent width of the three iron lines at 5914 , 5930 , and 6065  , while for na we compared the strength of the nad doublet at 589 nm with suitable synthetic spectra calculated for five different abundances . finally ca and ba abundances were obtained from the lines at 5857 , 6102 , and 5853 respectively using spectrosynthesis .",
    "mike data allowed us to perform a more complete abundance analysis and we present here our measurements for c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , ti , cr , fe , ni , y , ba , and eu . the line - list and the methodology we used are the same used in previous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) , so we refer to those articles for a detailed discussion about this point . here",
