    "in their pioneering work , foldy and wouthuysen  ( fw ) introduced the method of separating positive and negative energy states of the dirac hamiltonian  @xcite . in the presence of external fields the odd terms of the lowest order in  @xmath9",
    "are removed to the desired accuracy by a sequence of unitary transformations . as a result ,",
    "the states of the dirac hamiltonian having positive energies are transformed to the two - component form , in which two upper components are nonzero and two lower components vanish , up to expected accuracy .",
    "this way one reduces the dirac equation to two equations for two - component spinors describing states of positive and negative energies , respectively .",
    "the widely used second - order fw - transformation converts the dirac hamiltonian into a schrodinger hamiltonian with relativistic corrections :  @xmath10 term , the spin - orbit interaction and the darwin term .",
    "works considering higher - order fw transformations are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another possibility to transform the dirac hamiltonian to a two - component form was proposed by douglas and kroll  ( dk ) , ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "used mostly in the quantum chemistry , one performs a series of transformations leading to an expansion of the dirac hamiltonian in orders of external potential , see  @xcite . in each step of dk transformation the odd terms of the lowest order",
    "are removed up to expected accuracy . using this method it is possible to include many - electron effects into real atomic systems  @xcite . for a review of works related to this subject see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "practical limitations in applying higher - order fw or dk transformations are due to complicated calculations since one has to manipulate increasing numbers of noncommuting operators . to overcome these limitations several approaches",
    "were proposed , removing odd terms to a sufficiently high order with the use of numerical methods  @xcite .",
    "the resulting  @xmath11 schrodinger - like equations with relativistic corrections are then solved numerically for energies and wave functions . a good agreement between approximate and exact dirac energies",
    "was reported  @xcite .",
    "one can avoid complicated calculations in special cases using transformations separating exactly the dirac hamiltonian into a two - component form .",
    "such a transformation for free relativistic electrons was proposed by foldy and wouthuysen  @xcite .",
    "case  @xcite found an exact form of the fw transformation for the presence of a constant magnetic field .",
    "tsai  @xcite and weaver  @xcite reported exact fw transformation for the presence of a magnetic field and electro - weak interactions .",
    "moss and okninski  @xcite pointed out that there exist several transformations separating positive and negative states of the dirac hamiltonian , leading to similar but not identical results for transformed functions .",
    "nikitin  @xcite reported on fw - like transformations for a constant electric field , dipole potential and some classes of external fields with special symmetries .",
    "the common weakness of the above methods is inability to generalize their results to arbitrary potentials .",
    "there exists in the literature several examples of functions transformed with the use of fw - like or dk - like transformations .",
    "a calculation of transformed functions and the transformation kernel for the fw transformations for free dirac electrons were given by rusin and zawadzki in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for the presence of a magnetic field in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter paper ,",
    "the analytical expression for a transformed gaussian wave packet was obtained .",
    "neznamov and silenko  @xcite analyzed properties of functions transformed with the use of the fw - like transformations and showed that the lower components of resulting functions are in the second order of  @xmath9 . in several works related to dk - like transformations",
    "the resulting functions were obtained numerically  @xcite .",
    "a transformation of the dirac hamiltonian for any potential converting it into a block - diagonal form was proposed by eriksen in refs .",
    "this transformation is performed in a single step by an unitary operator  @xmath12 being a nonlinear function of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "because of its nonlinearity ,  @xmath12 was usually approximated by a finite series in powers of  @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the validity of eriksen transformation and its power - series expansion was confirmed by de vries  @xcite and silenko  @xcite . in the lowest - order terms , the eriksen transformation agrees with the results obtained by the fw method , but higher order terms differ  @xcite .",
    "the subject of the present work is to transform bound states of the dirac hamiltonian with a nontrivial potential by the eriksen operator  @xmath12 without expanding  @xmath12 in a power series . in our approach",
    "we concentrate on the transformed functions and their properties and not on the transformed operators .",
    "our calculations are performed for the relativistic hydrogen - like atom whose spectrum consists of both bound and continuum states . to illustrate our method and results the transformation is performed numerically for the three lowest bound states of the relativistic hydrogen - like atom :  @xmath0 ,  @xmath1 and  @xmath2 , for several values of the nuclear charge  @xmath13 . to our knowledge",
    "there was no attempt to calculate functions transformed by the single - step eriksen transformation for the dirac hamiltonian whose eigenfunctions are bound states .",
    "it should be reminded that solving the dirac equation ( analytically or numerically ) one directly obtains all its eigenvalues and eigenstates that can be used for calculations of observables , and no further transformation is needed .",
    "the dirac equation transformed to the block - diagonal form can also be used for calculation of the observables , and both approaches yield the same results because the wave functions in both representations are related each to other by the unitary transformation .",
