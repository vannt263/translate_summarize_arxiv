    "gauge theories in higher dimensions are a promising candidate beyond the standard model .",
    "such theories turn out to possess unexpectedly rich properties that shed new light and give a deep understanding on high energy physics .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that new mechanisms of gauge symmetry breaking @xcite , spontaneous supersymmetry breaking @xcite , and breaking of translational invariance @xcite can occur , and that various phase structures arise in field theoretical models on certain topological manifolds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , new diverse scenarios of solving the hierarchy problem have been proposed@xcite .",
    "higher dimensional field theories will be described by 4d effective theories at low energies .",
    "since we could not directly see extra dimensions , in particular , higher dimensional symmetries such as higher dimensional gauge symmetry and general covariance symmetry , one might ask what are remnants of the symmetries which originate from extra dimensions .",
    "they have to be hidden in the 4d effective theories .",
    "this is our motivation to investigate higher dimensional field theories from a 4d mass spectrum point of view .",
    "our results show that the 4d mass spectrum is governed by quantum - mechanical supersymmetry ( qm susy ) .",
    "especially , the 4d massless spectrum is closely related to zero energy vacuum states of the supersymmetry and depends crucially on boundary conditions of extra dimensions , which are severely restricted by compatibility with qm susy . in higher dimensional scalar theories ,",
    "qm susy would appear in 4d spectrum but its appearance is found to be accidental . in higher dimensional spinor , gauge and gravity theories , qm susy always appears in 4d mass spectrum .",
    "its origin turns out to be chiral symmetry , higher dimensional gauge symmetry and higher dimensional general covariance symmetry for spinor , gauge and gravity theories , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note that all the symmetries guarantee the masslessness of the fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we summarize the characteristic properties of qm susy . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we examine the 4d mass spectrum of higher dimensional scalar , spinor , gauge and gravity theories , separately and show that qm susy always appears in the 4d mass spectrum except for scalar theories .",
    "the section 7 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in any higher dimensional spinor / gauge / gravity theories with extra dimensions , quantum - mechanical supersymmetry turns out to be hidden in 4d spectrum and to play an important role to determine the spectrum of massless 4d fields , which are crucial ingredients in constructing low energy effective theories .",
    "the supersymmetric structure is found to be summarized in the minimal supersymmetry algebra , which consists of the hermitian operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , defined by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the hamiltonian and the supercharge .",
    "the operator @xmath1 is called a fermion `` number operator and the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are given by @xmath6 for bosonic '' states and @xmath7 for fermionic \" ones , although the words , boson and fermion , have nothing to do with particles of integer spins and half - odd integer spins .",
    "the readers should not confuse the quantum - mechanical supersymmetry with supersymmetry in quantum field theory , which implies a symmetry between bosonic states with integer spins and fermionic states with half - odd integer spins .",
    "the operators in the algebra ( [ qm_susy_algebra_1])-([qm_susy_algebra_3 ] ) are defined in quantum - mechanical systems and hence the supercharge @xmath4 does not possess any spinor index .",
    "we call the symmetry which obeys the algebra ( [ qm_susy_algebra_1])-([qm_susy_algebra_3 ] ) quantum - mechanical supersymmetry , or simply qm susy in this paper .",
    "let us first clarify characteristic properties of the algebra ( [ qm_susy_algebra_1])-([qm_susy_algebra_3 ] ) , we now show that if the system obeys the algebra , the spectrum has the following properties :    * the energy eigenvalues are non - negative , i.e. @xmath8 .",
    "* any positive energy state @xmath9 of @xmath10 forms a pair with the state @xmath11 of the same energy @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and vice versa .",
    "all positive energy states form supermultiplets . * zero energy states ( if exist ) do not necessarily form pairs of supermultiplets .    thus",
    ", a typical spectrum of qm susy systems will be given by fig.1 .",
    "the first property 1 ) of @xmath14 is derived from eq.([qm_susy_algebra_1 ] ) because @xmath15 for any normalized energy eigenstate @xmath16 . here",
    ", we have used the facts that the supercharge @xmath4 is hermitian and the norm of any state is non - negative .",
    "the second property 2 ) can be shown as follows : suppose that @xmath9 is an energy eigenstate with @xmath10 .",
    "then , the state @xmath17 has the same energy eigenvalue @xmath12 but the opposite eigenvalue of @xmath5 because @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these relations imply that @xmath20 . assuming @xmath21 with @xmath22",
    ", we find @xmath23 we can then take @xmath24 without any loss of generality . thus , the states @xmath25 and @xmath26 form a supermultiplet and are related each other through the susy relations @xmath27 the above result immediately shows that @xmath28 this implies that zero energy states do not necessarily form supermultiplets .",
    "we have found that characteristic properties of qm susy is nicely summarized in fig.1 .",
    "thus , if we encounter such a spectrum , qm susy is expected to be hidden in the system .",
    "in fact , we will find this type of spectrum again and again in the following sections .",
    "let us start with a 5d real massless scalar field theory compactified on a circle @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the 4-dimensional minkowski space - time coordinate and @xmath32 is the coordinate of the extra dimension on the circle @xmath29 of the circumference @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 denotes a potential term but it will not be concerned in our analysis . since the extra dimension is compactified on the circle of the circumference @xmath33 , we have to specify a boundary condition on the field @xmath35 .",
    "let us take a periodic boundary condition , as an example , i.e. @xmath36 we will make a comment on other boundary conditions at the end of this section . in order to obtain the 4d mass spectrum , we expand the 5d field @xmath35 into the kaluza - klein modes such as @xmath37 where @xmath38 correspond to 4d scalar fields and @xmath39 are the mass eigenfunctions of the differential operator @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 here , @xmath42 denote normalization constants . we should note that the set of @xmath43 forms a complete set so that the expansion ( [ mode_expansion_scalar ] ) should be regarded as an identity .    inserting the expansion ( [ mode_expansion_scalar ] ) into the action ( [ 5d_scalar_action ] ) and using the orthogonal relations of @xmath39 with an appropriate normalization , we find @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the 4d mass of the field @xmath46 and is given by @xmath47 it follows that there appears a single massless mode @xmath48 and that all massive modes @xmath49 are doubly degenerate .",
    "thus , the 4d mass spectrum is given by fig.2 .",
    "this is nothing but a typical qm susy spectrum !",
    "we can , in fact , show that the minimal supersymmetry algebra appears in the system and the model will be the simplest higher dimensional field model that possesses qm susy .",
    "now the question is what are the operators @xmath0 and @xmath5 of qm susy in the present system .",
    "the answer is @xmath50 the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath3 correspond to the mass squared @xmath51 .",
    "the supercharge q is just the momentum operator , i.e. @xmath52 and satisfies the desired relation @xmath53 .",
    "the operator @xmath5 is given by the parity operator @xmath54 .",
    "it implies that the states of @xmath55 correspond to even ( odd ) parity states .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath4 anticommutes with @xmath5 , as they should .",
    "the parity even ( odd ) function @xmath56 has @xmath55 and they form a supermultiplet because @xmath57 for @xmath58 . furthermore , @xmath59 because @xmath60 is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "this implies that the zero mode @xmath60 has no superpartner , as expected .",
    "therefore , we have confirmed that the degeneracy for the nonzero modes in the 4d mass spectrum ( see fig.2 ) can be explained by qm susy . as mentioned before",
    ", we make a comment on boundary conditions . in the above analysis",
    ", we assumed the periodic boundary condition ( [ periodic_bc ] ) .",
    "we can show that the system with the antiperiodic boundary condition @xmath61 possesses qm susy as well but without any massless 4d state .",
    "boundary conditions other than periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , , neumann b.c .",
    "@xmath62 , twisted b.c .",
    "@xmath63 for a complex scalar .",
    "] however , lead to non - degenerate 4d spectrum and no qm susy .",
    "thus , we conclude that qm susy found in the scalar field theory is accidental and there is no general mechanism to guarantee qm susy in any scalar field theories .",
    "in this section , we consider a 5d spinor filed on an interval @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a 4-component 5d dirac spinor field and @xmath67 is a 5-dimensional ( bulk ) mass .",
    "the @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 .",
    "here , we have introduced a coupling to a real scalar field @xmath70 and allow it to have a nontrivial @xmath32-dependence as a background field .",
    "the spinor @xmath66 can be expanded as @xmath71 where @xmath72 are 4-dimensional chiral spinors defined by @xmath73 .",
    "the sets of functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are assumed separately to form complete sets and should be chosen for @xmath76 to be 4d mass eigenstates . from the representation theory of the poincar ' e group , a massive 4d dirac spinor @xmath77 consists of chiral spinors @xmath78 and @xmath79 and they form the mass terms @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "a massless 4d spinor is chiral and hence does not necessarily form a pair of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the 4d mass spectrum of ( infinitely many ) 4d spinors @xmath83 will be schematically given by fig.3 .",
    "this is nothing but a typical qm susy spectrum , as discussed in section 2 .",
    "thus , we expect that the minimal supersymmetry algebra is hidden in the 4d spectrum .",
    "this is indeed the case , as we will see below .",

    "we will discuss how to determine boundary conditions later . ] the sets of @xmath74 and @xmath75 form complete sets , as they should .",
    "it follows from eqs.([d+df = m^2f ] ) , ( [ dd+g = m^2 g ] ) that @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) obeys the same eigenequation ( [ dd+g = m^2 g ] ) ( ( [ d+df = m^2f ] ) ) as @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) , and hence that @xmath97 and @xmath96 are related each other through the susy relations @xmath98 with appropriate normalizations .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath97 and @xmath96 are doubly degenerate ( except for @xmath99 ) , as expected .",
    "the minimal supersymmetry algebra is manifest by introducing the operators as @xmath100 those operators act on 2-component wavefunctions @xmath101 now , it is not difficult to show that with the susy relations ( [ spinor_susy_relation_1 ] ) , ( [ spinor_susy_relation_2 ] ) and with the orthonormal relations of @xmath74 and @xmath75 the action can be written , in terms of the 4d spinors , into the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the part of the lagrangian consisting of massless chiral spinors and @xmath104 with @xmath105 for @xmath106 . thus , we have shown that @xmath72 are mass eigenstates with @xmath45 , as announced before . to determine the chiral zero mode part @xmath103",
    ", we need to specify boundary conditions at @xmath107 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "it turns out that the choice of boundary conditions is crucial for the existence of massless chiral spinors .",
    "allowed boundary conditions compatible with qm susy have been classified and are listed below:@xcite    * @xmath108 , * @xmath109 , * @xmath110 , * @xmath111 .    since the mode functions @xmath87 and @xmath88 obey the susy relations ( [ spinor_susy_relation_1 ] ) and ( [ spinor_susy_relation_2 ] ) , chiral zero modes ( if any ) should satisfy @xmath112 with @xmath113 . these first order differential equations can easily be solved as @xmath114 we should emphasize that the above solutions do not insure the existence of the massless chiral spinors @xmath81 and @xmath82 because they have to be discarded from the physical spectrum if @xmath115 and/or @xmath116 do not obey the boundary conditions .",

    "the requirement leads to @xmath156 combining all the above results , we have found the four types of boundary conditions compatible with supersymmetry,@xcite @xmath157 it follows that the above boundary conditions ensure the hermiticity of the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath158 therefore , we have succeeded to obtain the consistent set of boundary conditions that ensure the hermiticity of the supercharge and the hamiltonian and also that the action of the supercharge on @xmath152 is well defined .",
    "since the supersymmetry is a direct consequence of higher - dimensional gauge invariance , our requirements on boundary conditions should be , at least , necessary conditions to preserve it .",

    "this implies that the 4d gauge symmetry is broken except for the type ( n , n ) boundary conditions .",
    "it is instructive to discuss the relation between the qm susy and the higher dimensional gauge symmetry .",
    "the relation becomes apparent by expressing the action , in terms of the 4d mass eigenstates , as @xmath173 where @xmath103 is the lagrangian consisting of the massless fields and @xmath174 with @xmath175 .",

    "the higher dimensional general covariance symmetry similarly guarantees that the nonzero vector mode @xmath227 can absorb the unphysical scalar mode @xmath204 to become massive with three degrees of freedom , and that the nonzero graviton mode @xmath228 can then absorb the massive mode @xmath229 to become massive with five degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the origin of qm susy and there appear _ two _ qm susys in higher dimensional gravity theories : one connects the mass eigenfunction @xmath88 to @xmath201 .",
    "the other connects the mass eigenfunction @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the chiral , higher dimensional gauge and higher dimensional general covariance symmetries are all related to the symmetries that guarantee the masslessness of spinor , vector and tensor fields , respectively",
    ". since massless particles are crucially important at low energy physics , it would be of great interest to investigate qm susy in more details .",
