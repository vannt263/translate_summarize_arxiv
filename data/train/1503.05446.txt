    "orbit angles is not known .",

    "the spin  orbit misalignment is primordial , rather than due to the migration .",
    "even after the disk dissipation or the completion of migration , spin  orbit angle can evolve due to the gravitational perturbation from the companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the effective temperature and surface gravity at each point on the stellar surface , and gravity - darkening exponent @xmath12 characterizes the strength of the gravity darkening , which is theoretically @xmath13 for a barotropic star with a radiative envelope .",
    "when a planet transits a star with such an inhomogeneous and generally non - axisymmetric brightness distribution , an anomaly of @xmath23 appears in the light curve , where @xmath24 is the transit depth .",

    "* hereafter b11 ) is known to be in disagreement with the later spectroscopic measurement of @xmath1 with the doppler tomography @xcite .",
    "in addition , inconsistent results arise even within the gravity - darkening analyses , depending on the choice of the limb - darkening coefficients or @xmath12 @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "it is worth revisiting the reliability and limitation of this method more carefully , in order for this unique method to be applied to more systems in future and provide credible results .    in this paper , we reanalyze a well - known example of the gravity - darkened transit of kepler-13ab , with more data than used in the previous analysis by b11 . we investigate the systematic effects in the spin ",

    "we find that @xmath2 and @xmath1 can differ by as large as @xmath91 due to the choice of the above parameters , but the difference is not so large as to explain the disagreement with the doppler tomography .",
    "the main difference from the b11 case with this new set of parameters is the different constraint on @xmath111 , which is proportional to the combination @xmath112 ( c.f . , equation [ eq : vsini ] ) . with smaller @xmath17 and larger",
    "@xmath62 , the stellar rotation rate slightly higher than the b11 case is favored .",
    "we find that the difference in @xmath37 is less important compared to the above effect .",
    "we also find that larger @xmath105 yields larger @xmath34 , which makes the impact parameter or @xmath113 smaller to give the same ingress / egress duration .",
    "next , we allow @xmath30 to be free , and find that the resulting spin ",
    "orbit angle is very sensitive to this parameter .",

    "the strong dependence on @xmath75 is illustrated in figure [ fig : is_lambda_correlation ] , which shows that @xmath1 and @xmath2 vary by several tens of degrees depending on @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , the result indicates that the gravity - darkened light curve is actually compatible with the doppler tomography solution if we choose @xmath114 ; such a solution will be discussed in section [ ssec : koi13_joint ] .          in section [ ssec : koi13_systematic ] , we found that the gravity - darkened light curve is compatible with the value of @xmath1 estimated from the doppler tomography if @xmath115 .",

    "we use the same two models (  light - curve solution \" with @xmath97 and  joint solution \" with @xmath75 fitted ) as discussed in section [ sec : koi13 ] . in order not to underestimate the errors in the three angles , we fit all the other model parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 ( for the joint model ) , @xmath31 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and @xmath35 as well , which should not vary temporally in our model . using the best values in table [ tab : koi13_gdfit ]",
    ", we impose the constraints on these parameters except for @xmath31 and @xmath35 , through the second term of equation ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) . in fitting much noisier individual transits , this prescription assures that the parameters converge to the values consistent with those from the phase - folded light curves , while preserving their differences from transit to transit .",
    "we also discard the transits for which fit does not converge due to the data gaps and/or flare - like brightening features sometimes found in the light curves",
    ". the resulting sequences of the transit parameters are plotted in figure [ fig : tpars ] .        as mentioned above",
    ", we again find the clear linear trend in @xmath33 from individual transits .",
    "we fit the linear model to the time series of @xmath33 using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm and obtain the rates of change in the upper part of table [ tab : fit_angles ] . here",
    "we only report the slopes for absolute values of @xmath33 because its actual sign depends on the sign of @xmath222 , which can never be determined with the current observations ( we arbitrarily choose @xmath223 in this paper , as discussed after equation [ eq : psi ] ) . comparing the light - curve solution and joint solution , we find that the rate of @xmath113 change is insensitive to @xmath1 or @xmath75 because @xmath113 is mainly determined from the transit duration . with @xmath28 calculated from @xmath53 ,",
    "our value for @xmath224 is found to be consistent with @xmath225 by @xcite , but our constraint is several times better .",
    "figure [ fig : tpars ] also shows the abrupt systematic changes in @xmath34 .",
    "these changes occur exactly in phase with the border of different quarters indicated with different colors ( black and gray ) . for this reason ,",
    "they are unlikely to be of physical origin , but are probably due to the seasonal transit depth variations similar to those reported by @xcite for hat - p-7 . in addition , some of the parameters ( most notably @xmath53 and @xmath36 ) show the long - term modulation of the period @xmath226 .",

    "we utilize the same analytic precession model as in @xcite , which constitutes an analytic solution of the secular equations of motion derived by @xcite . in this model , the orbital and spin angular momenta precess around the total angular momentum at the same angular rate given by @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the precession rate of the orbital angular momentum around the stellar spin , and explicitly given by @xmath271 with @xmath25 being the stellar quadrupole moment . in the kepler-13a system , the spin angular momentum ,",

    "we do not relate @xmath25 to the other parameters like the stellar oblateness as done in @xcite . to realistically evaluate the credible intervals of @xmath25 and @xmath221 by marginalization",
    ", uncertainties in @xmath53 , @xmath36 , @xmath32 , and @xmath248 should also be taken into account",
    ". however , these parameters are not well determined from the data of @xmath33 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , they are floated with the following gaussian priors .",
    "the first three are assigned the same central values and widths as in table [ tab : koi13_gdfit ] .",
    "for the mass ratio , we take the mean and standard deviation of the results reported by s14 , @xcite , and @xcite , which come from the amplitudes of the ellipsoidal variation and doppler beaming . we also impose the gaussian prior on @xmath221 centered on @xmath277 ( the value for @xmath278 polytrope by * ? ? ? * ) and with the width of @xmath279 , which is chosen to enclose the solar value , @xmath280 .",
    "the constraints from the mcmc fit are summarized in the middle and bottom parts of table [ tab : fit_angles ] and the best - fit models are plotted with the solid lines in figure [ fig : fit_angles ] . basically , the precession model is compatible with the observations both for the light - curve solution and the joint solution .",
    "the value of @xmath25 and the corresponding precession period , however , are different by a factor of a few , in spite of the similar observed slopes in @xmath33 .",
    "while @xmath9 for the light - curve solution is consistent with the earlier estimate by @xcite , @xmath281 from observed tdvs and @xmath282 from the stellar model , the joint solution yields a smaller value , @xmath8 .",
    "the difference comes from the different three - dimensional architectures of the system described by the two solutions .",
    "since all of @xmath33 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are constrained from the gravity - darkened light curves , relative configuration of the stellar spin and orbital angular momenta are completely specified in three dimensions .",
    "this means that the _ phase _ of the precession during the _ kepler _ mission , which corresponds to the left end in the right column of figure [ fig : angles_evolution ] , is observationally constrained ; from the top panel , we find that @xmath33 is closer to the bottom of the sine curve for the light - curve solution ( blue dashed line ) , while that for the joint solution ( red solid line ) resides in the phase of a rapid increase .",
    "for this reason , a larger precession rate ( i.e. , shorter precession period ) is required for the light - curve solution to match the observed change in @xmath33 . according to equations ( [ eq : domega ] ) and ( [ eq : domega_p ] )",
    ", the larger precession rate can be achieved by increasing either @xmath25 or @xmath264 .",
    "however , the larger precession rate also induces faster variations in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , contradicting their almost constant observed values ( middle and bottom panels in figure [ fig : fit_angles ] ) .",
    "the only way to mitigate this conflict is to make @xmath25 larger ( i.e. , increase the precession rate ) while keeping @xmath264 small , making it more difficult to move stellar spin axis . with equation ( [ eq : ls ] ) , this explains why @xmath248 is smaller and @xmath221 is larger for the light - curve solution than for the joint solution in table [ tab : fit_angles ] .",
    "accordingly , the bottom panel of the right column in figure [ fig : angles_evolution ] exhibits the smaller precession amplitude for @xmath2 in the former solution ( blue dashed line ) than the latter ( red solid line ) .",
    "the approximately three times difference in the precession period would be apparent even on the short time scale ( left column in figure [ fig : angles_evolution ] ) .",
    "as shown in the middle panel , as large as @xmath283 change in @xmath1 is expected within the next @xmath284 for the light - curve solution , which may well be detectable given the current precision of the spin ",
    "orbit angle measurement ( nominally down to a few degrees ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath1 for the joint solution is almost constant . from this point of view",
    ", the joint solution may slightly be favored even with the current data , because the nearly - constant values observed for @xmath1 and @xmath2 are more natural for the joint solution than for the light - curve one , for the reasons discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "this indication also manifests itself in the fact that the resulting @xmath248 and @xmath221 better agree with our prior knowledge in the joint solution .",
    "the more decisive conclusion will be obtained with the future follow - up observations of @xmath1 using doppler tomography , as well as the transit duration observations to better constrain @xmath33 , and hence the precession rate .",
    "if our joint solution is correct , variations in @xmath1 will not be detected in near future .",
    "on the other hand , if the light - curve solution is actually correct and @xmath1 from the doppler tomography is somehow systematically biased , @xmath1 should change ; this _ temporal variation _ would be observable with the doppler tomography even if it were biased .",
    "or , it may even turn out that the precession scenario is wrong . in any case , tracking the future evolution of the system configuration can be used for an independent test of our solution , not to mention for better constraining stellar internal structure via @xmath25 and @xmath221 , for which few observational constraints have been obtained .",
    "armed with the methodology established using the distinct anomaly in kepler-13a ( section [ sec : koi13 ] ) , we discuss another , more subtle anomaly in this section . here the methodology is further extended to include the information from asteroseismology as well as from the rm effect , and applied to an f - type star .",
    "it has been pointed out in several studies that the transit light curve of hat - p-7 exhibits a small anomaly of @xmath285 .",
    "@xcite , who reported this anomaly first , attributed it to the local spot - like gravity darkening induced by the gravity of the jupiter - mass companion hat - p-7b .",
    "they ruled out the gravity darkening of stellar rotational origin on the basis of the inspection that the anomaly is localized in a part of the transit .",
    "later analyses with more data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , have shown that the anomaly is seemingly correlated over the whole transit duration , as in the top panel of figure [ fig : hatp7_best ] . moreover",
    ", the amplitude of the observed anomaly may be too large to be explained by the spot scenario . according to @xcite , the planet s gravity induces the surface temperature variation of  a few @xmath286 , \" which leads to the surface brightness variation of @xmath287 . if a planet crosses over a spot fainter by @xmath288 than the other part of the stellar disk , amplitude of the expected anomaly in the _ relative flux _ is about @xmath289 , which is order - of - magnitude smaller than the observed one .",
    "we therefore analyze this anomaly assuming that it is originated from the gravity darkening induced by stellar rotation , whose effect should not be localized but manifest during the whole transit duration .    unlike the case of kepler-13a , anomaly in the transit light curve is not clear on a quarter - by - quarter basis for hat - p-7 .",
    "in addition , no ttvs / tdvs have been detected for this planet .",
    "for these reasons , we deal with the light curve obtained by folding all the available sc , pdcsap fluxes ( q017 ) processed as described in section [ ssec : method_data ] .",
    "we use the spectroscopic constraint @xmath290 throughout this section .",
    "this value is based on @xcite , though its error bar is enlarged to take into account other estimates for this quantity that give slightly different values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the observed anomaly is really due to gravity darkening , it should be persistent over all observation span .",
    "it is important to confirm the property because @xcite only reported the bump before the mid - transit time .",
    "thus , we divide the transits into four consecutive groups ( q04 , 59 , 1013 , 1417 ) , phase - fold and fit each of them with the model without gravity darkening separately , and examine the shapes of the residuals .",
    "although fewer numbers of transits lead to noisier phase - folded light curves , ten - minute binned residuals in the left column of figure [ fig : seasons ] exhibit a similar feature ( brightening before mid - transit and dimming after it ) in every span of data .    besides , @xcite reported seasonal variation in the transit depth depending on the quarter , which is reproduced in our analysis with q017 data . and figure [ fig : tpars ] . ] to confirm that the anomaly is not an artifact related to this seasonal variation",
    ", we also perform a similar analysis as above but this time grouping the transits that have similar depths . as shown in the right column of figure [ fig : seasons ] , we find that the same feature is apparent regardless of the season and the anomaly is not affected by the systematic depth variation . for this reason , along with its unconstrained origin , we do not try to make corrections for this systematic in the following analyses .      as in section",
    "[ sec : koi13 ] , we consider both light - curve solution and joint solution that takes into account the constraints from other observations .",
    "first , the light - curve solution is obtained with @xmath75 fixed to be zero ( figure [ fig : hatp7_best ] , second and third columns in table [ tab : hatp7 ] ) . in this case , we find two solutions with different signs of @xmath33 , which are indistinguishable in terms of the minimum @xmath88 . is replaced with @xmath291 and @xmath1 with @xmath292 . these intrinsically - degenerate solutions",
    "are not discussed here because they are in any case rejected in the joint solution , where @xmath1 is constrained by the prior .",
    "this is the same logic as used in the last paragraph of section [ ssec : koi13_b11 ] . ]",
    "the values quoted in table [ tab : hatp7 ] are the median , 15.87 , and 84.13 percentiles of the mcmc posteriors sampled with emcee @xcite .",
    "our model reasonably reproduces the global feature of the anomaly ( positive before the mid transit and negative after it ) , yielding @xmath293 for @xmath294 degrees of freedom .",
    "we compute the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) for the best - fit models with and without gravity darkening , and find @xmath295 , which formally indicates that the gravity - darkened model is strongly favored .",
    "our solution points to a nearly pole - on configuration with @xmath296 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the recent asteroseismic analyses by @xcite and , but the nominal constraint on @xmath2 from the gravity - darkened model is much tighter . on the other hand , @xmath1 is not constrained very well with the light curve asymmetry alone .",
    "the difficulty is inevitable in the pole - on configuration , where the brightness distribution on the stellar disk is almost axisymmetric even in the presence of gravity darkening . in such a case",
    ", @xmath0 is always close to @xmath297 regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "one remaining issue regarding our solution is that the resulting rotation frequency may be too large .",
    "given the age ( @xmath298 ) and @xmath299 of the host star , the rotation frequency from the light - curve solution , @xmath300 ( equivalent to @xmath301 ) , is consistent with the gyrochronology relation by @xcite ; see section 6 of .",
    "however , our value of @xmath36 is much larger than those from asteroseismology , @xmath302 ( @xmath303 credible interval by * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath304 .",
    "in fact , the prior used in these analyses , @xmath305 , does not fully cover the range we investigate here with the gravity - darkened light curve .",
    "still , the discrepancy is only weakly reduced even with the new analysis adopting the prior range extended up to @xmath306 , which yields @xmath307 as the @xmath303 credible interval ( by courtesy of othman benomar ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to examine",
    "if the gravity - darkened model is compatible with the seismic analysis , we then search for a joint solution including the constraints both from the rm measurement and asteroseismology . from the rm effect , we incorporate the constraint @xmath308 , which comes from the average and standard deviation of the analyses for the three different radial velocity data @xcite . from asteroseismology",
    ", we adopt the above updated posterior for @xmath36 as the prior , and performed an mcmc sampling with emcee . to properly take into account the uncertainty from the limb - darkening profile ,",
    "@xmath75 is also floated .",
    "the resulting credible intervals are summarized in the fourth and fifth columns in table [ tab : hatp7 ] , and the model that maximizes the likelihood multiplied by the prior on @xmath36 is plotted with a dashed line in figure [ fig : hatp7_best ] .",
    "we again find two equally good solutions , both of which indicate nearly pole - on configurations with slightly prograde and retrograde orbits , @xmath10 and @xmath309 .",
    "although the resulting @xmath36 still prefers a higher rotation rate than that from asteroseismology , their difference is now mitigated to the @xmath310 level ; we construct the probability distribution for @xmath311 , @xmath36 from out joint analysis minus @xmath36 from asteroseismology , using their posteriors and find its @xmath310 credible region as @xmath312 .",
    "we argue that the level of discrepancy is acceptable , considering that the rotational mode splitting is not clearly detected in the power spectrum of hat - p-7 s light curves .    finally , it is also worth considering the case where @xmath313 , given the unconstrained nature of the gravity darkening in f dwarfs .",
    "smaller values of @xmath314 are usually expected for solar - like stars with convective envelopes , while and argue that @xmath12 is close to @xmath13 in the limit of slow rotation under several assumptions .",
    "we repeat the above joint analysis floating @xmath12 with the prior uniform between @xmath147 and @xmath315 , and obtain @xmath316 for both solutions in table [ tab : hatp7 ] . on the one hand , the fact may support the claims by and ; on the other hand , it may simply indicate some incompleteness in our gravity - darkening model , as also suggested by the tension in @xmath36 and the still correlated residuals before the mid transit ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : hatp7_best ] ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath317 is adopted , we find that even higher rotation rate ( @xmath318 ) is favored , making the discrepancy with asteroseismology more serious .",
    "although the validity of @xmath12 we obtain is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that our conclusion for a pole - on orbit is robust against the adopted value of @xmath12 ; in both analyses where @xmath12 is fitted and @xmath12 is fixed to be @xmath319 , the constraints on @xmath0 differ less than @xmath320 from the results in table [ tab : hatp7 ] .",

    "<S> analysis of the transit light curve deformed by the stellar gravity darkening allows us to photometrically measure both components of the spin  orbit angle @xmath0 , its sky projection @xmath1 and inclination of the stellar spin axis @xmath2 . in this paper , we apply the method to two transiting hot jupiter systems monitored with the _ kepler _ spacecraft , kepler-13a and hat - p-7 . for kepler-13a , we find @xmath3 and @xmath4 adopting the spectroscopic constraint @xmath5 by johnson et al . </S>",

    "<S> orbit precession in this system . by fitting the precession model to the time series of @xmath7 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 obtained with the gravity - darkened model , </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the stellar quadrupole moment @xmath8 for our new solution , which is several times smaller than @xmath9 obtained for the previous one . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the difference can be observable in the future evolution of @xmath1 , thus providing a possibility to test our solution with follow - up observations . </S>",
    "<S> the second target , hat - p-7 , is the first f - dwarf star analyzed with the gravity - darkening method . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis points to a nearly pole - on configuration with @xmath10 or @xmath11 and the gravity - darkening exponent @xmath12 consistent with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> such an observational constraint on @xmath12 can be useful for testing the theory of gravity darkening . </S>"
