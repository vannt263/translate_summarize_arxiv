    "bars are expected to have a profound effect on disk galaxy evolution because they constitute a major departure from an axial symmetry and hence facilitate angular momentum and mass redistribution . despite prolonged and focused investigation of bar formation and evolution many theoretical and observational issues remain unresolved . among these are the origin of bars in the universe  spontaneous or tidally induced , evolution of bar fractions with redshifts , and theoretical predictions of bar pattern speeds .",
    "the intricacies of the bar growth or decay with time are obscure  how do bars capture orbits ? do all bars extend to their corotation radii ?",
    "lastly , various aspects of nested bar systems are only now beginning to be analyzed .    because the underlying dynamics of bars is strongly nonlinear",
    ", their numerical modeling has spearheaded the efforts to understand their orbital structure , ability to channel the angular momentum to the outer disk and dark matter ( dm ) halo , efficiency in triggering the radial gas inflows , and more . while we have gained some insight to all of these processes ,",
    "much remains to be done and one expects additional effects to surface .    in this work we aim at deeper understanding of angular momentum redistribution in the disk - halo system facilitated by the stellar bars in the presence of the gas component .",
    "here , we analyze a set of equilibrium _ collisionless _",
    "models which differ by a single parameter from each other . in the associated paper , we add the gas component to the system without affecting the mass distribution there ( villa - vargas et al .",
    ", paper  ii , in preparation ) .",
    "our collisionless modeling is in a way complementary to that of athanassoula ( 2003 ) .",
    "we reproduce some of the correlations between the bar , disk and halo properties discussed in the above work and quantify additional correlations found .",
    "all these will be compared to models with gas .",
    "importance of a galactic spheroidal component in bar evolution has been gradually understood , from its supposedly stabilizing effect on the disk ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "1982 ) , to serving as disk angular momentum sink ( e.g. , sellwood 1980 ; weinberg 1985 ; debattista & sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula 2002 ) , and appears to be full of controversies ( e.g. , christodoulou , shlosman & tohline 1995a , b ; athanassoula 2008 ) .",
    "study of the dominant role of resonance interactions between the bar and surrounding orbits was pioneered by lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) and applied to bar and halo orbits by tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) , athanassoula ( 2002 ) , martinez - valpuesta , shlosman & heller ( 2006 ) , ceverino & klypin ( 2007 ) , weinberg & katz ( 2007a , b ) and dubinski , berentzen & shlosman ( 2009 ) .",
    "toomre ( 1981 ) argued that the bar growth can be damped by the introduction of an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , by cutting off the swing amplification mechanism for the @xmath3 modes .",
    "hotter stellar disks are expected to be more stable as well ( e.g. , athanassoula & sellwood 1986 ) .",
    "counter - intuitively , in the long run , a disk embedded in a more centrally concentrated halo develops a stronger and longer bar ( athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ) .",
    "a comprehensive analysis by athanassoula ( 2003 ) has shown that the efficiency of resonances in angular momentum transfer depends on the dm and stellar dispersion velocities and the dm densities in the vicinity of the major resonances .",
    "as the resonances sweep across the phase - space , about @xmath4 of dm particles are locked in the lower order resonances at any given time ( dubinski et al .",
    "additional aspects of the bar evolution are known to be influenced by the spheroidal components , such as the vertical buckling instability in the bar ( berentzen et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in general ,",
    "@xmath0 transfer in the disk - halo systems can depend on three parameters , namely , the particle population near low level resonances and the velocity dispersions in the disk and halo ( e.g. , athanassoula 2003 ) . in principle , this means dependence on the halo central mass concentration and on radial velocity dispersions in the disk and the halo .",
    "we , therefore , focus on how parameters of the dm halo distribution , such as its mass , concentration , extent , and rms velocities affect the disk - halo evolution and the angular momentum transfer mediated by the stellar bar . specifically , we are interested in how the presence of gas in the disk influence the angular momentum redistribution in the system . for the purpose of clarity , we separate our discussion of collisionless models ( this paper i ) from models with gas ( paper ii ) .",
    "collisionless models are used in order to verify the basic details of bar evolution in order to serve as benchmarks for models with gas .",
    "they also are used to calibrate our results to those of athanassoula ( 2003 ) .",
    "our paper is structured as follows :  2 describes the numerics , initial conditions and model parameters . ",
    "3 provides results on basic evolution of stellar bars in our sets of models and analyzes the redistribution of angular momentum in these systems , while  4 is focused on correlations between various parameters in the bar - disk - halo models .",
    "we use the @xmath5-body part of the ftm-4.4 hybrid code ( e.g. , heller & shlosman 1994 ; heller , shlosman & athanassoula 2007b ) to evolve the stellar disks and dm halos .",
    "the gravitational forces are calculated using the falcon routine ( dehnen 2002 ) which scales as @xmath6 .",
    "the units of mass and distance are taken as @xmath7 and 10  kpc respectively .",
    "this makes the unit of time as @xmath8 when @xmath9 , and the velocity unit @xmath10 .",
    "the gravitational softening is @xmath11 for stars and dm particles .",
    "the models consist of a stellar disk with @xmath12 and of dm halo with @xmath13 particles .",
    "the initial conditions were created following the prescriptions and density profiles from hernquist ( 1990 ) .",
    "the mass volume density distribution in the disk is given in cylindrical coordinates by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the disk mass , @xmath16 is a radial scale length and @xmath17 is a vertical scaleheight .",
    "the density of the spherical halo is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass of the halo , @xmath20 is a gaussian cutoff radius and @xmath21 is the core radius .",
    "@xmath22 is the normalization constant defined by @xmath23 \\ } ^{-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 .",
    "the particle velocities , dispersion velocities and asymmetric drift corrections have been calculated using moments of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "since models thus constructed are not in exact virial equilibrium , the halo component was relaxed for @xmath25 in the frozen disk potential .      our goal is to investigate the effect of the dm mass distribution on the evolution of stellar bars in a live disk  halo system .",
    "we choose a specific model , defined here as the standard model ( sd ) , where the dm density profiles are specified by three parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , corresponding to the dm halo mass , dm core radius and the dm gaussian cutoff radius .",
    "based on the sd model , three sequences of models have been created , each sequence resulting from varying one of the parameters only . in the fourth sequence ,",
    "we simultaneously modify two parameters at the time , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , in attempt to target the outer halo only , while trying to keep the inner halo unchanged . in the sd model",
    ", the halo - to - disk mass ratio in the inner @xmath26 is kept to unity .",

    ".parameters of the standard model [ cols= \" < , > , < , > \" , ]     [ sd_param ]    the initial mass volume density profile in the disk is kept unchanged in all models .",
    "the spatial distribution of the stellar particles is thus identical in all realizations of the initial conditions . on the other hand , the velocities of the stellar particles",
    "have been adjusted in each models to provide for the changing rotational support against the combined gravitational potentials of the varying disk - halo systems .",
    "the four model sequences are as following :    @xmath19 sequence : : :    the mass of the halo , @xmath19 , has been reduced to    @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( models m70 and m40    respectively ) of the sd model . @xmath21",

    "the number of particles and the numerical truncation radii are the same as in the sd model .",
    "the halo mass @xmath19 is conserved in sequences @xmath21 and @xmath34 .",
    "the dm density profiles of all models after relaxation in the frozen disk potential are shown in figure  [ rhomods ] .",
    "the resulting dm density profiles exhibit monotonic decrease along the @xmath35 sequence , show a progressively larger core in the @xmath21 sequence , move the outer halo mass inward to the inner halo , across @xmath36 , in the @xmath34 sequence , and increase the outer halo mass while leaving the core unchanged in the hybrid models sequence .",
    "the initial circular velocity curves , showing the contributions from the disk , the halo and the total , are displayed in figure  [ vcir3 ] .",
    "models m40 , c30 and c57 host maximal disks which dominate the potential of the inner part . models sd , m70 , mt1 and mt2 have equal contributions of disk and halo at @xmath37 , while t22 and t16 are halo dominated . with the development of the stellar bar ,",
    "the disk typically becomes even more dominating , although the inner halo is also dragged in an adiabatic contraction ( e.g. , dubinski et al .",
    "the model sequences described in table  2 differ only by the parameters of dm distribution as given by eq .  2 .",
    "these include the total mass of the halo , its core size and the gaussian truncation radii .",
    "as the bar properties and angular momentum evolution are both heavily dependent on the mass distribution in the system , the choice of the free parameters allows us to fine - tune the changes .",
    "because the dm appears to be on the receptive side of the angular momentum transfer , we target the halo as a whole , and its inner and outer parts separately .",
    "discussion and comparison with published models is made in  4 .      to gauge the strength of the bar we use the fourier amplitude @xmath38 of the @xmath3 mode normalized by the @xmath39 mode .",
    "it is obtained by various methods  here we show the results of integration over all the disk , and integration over restricted cylindrical volumes of a particular interest .",
    "we define @xmath38 in the integration limit over the fixed radial range @xmath40 .",
    "second , we define @xmath41 when integrate over @xmath42 range , where @xmath43 is the bar size defined in  3.2 . intuitively , the second definition reflects the bar properties more fully because @xmath41 is not diluted by the disk properties .",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath41 show some similarities , e.g. , the same peaks , raises and drops , and differences , e.g. , the relative strength of the peaks ( fig .  [ rb_a2 ] , first and second columns ) .",
    "most models show common stages in the evolution of @xmath38 and @xmath41 : ( 1 ) an initial exponential steep rise , ( 2 ) a subsequent peak or plateau followed by a sudden drop , ensued by ( 3 ) a more gradual and sustained rise , ending by ( 4 ) a saturation of the bar strength .",
    "the duration of each stage varies from model to model , but stages `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' are much shorter than stage `` 3 '' .",
    "we refer to stages `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' as the dynamical evolution of the bar , and stages `` 3 '' and `` 4 '' as the secular evolution of the bar .",
    "models m40 and t16 are the exceptions .",
    "the former model has the least massive halo and exhibits a prolonged secular growth of the bar after the first peak .",
    "the bar amplitude does not reach saturation even in the hubble time .",
    "the latter model has the most massive halo core and the bar strength never shows a clear first peak seen in all other models .",
    "however a careful analysis of @xmath38 and especially @xmath41 reveals that the exponential growth is terminated at @xmath44 and the subsequent evolution lucks the vertical buckling instability ( see  3.4 ) , but otherwise follows the path of other models .",
    "we take a closer look at these trends in  4 .",
    "we note that our decision to create one - parameter sequences naturally leads to a wide spectrum of bar properties and can include some of the extreme behavior .",
    "some clear trends of the bar strength behavior can be observed along each of the sequences defined in  2.2 .",
    "first , in all models , except the two exclusions mentioned above , @xmath38  and @xmath41  have saturated by @xmath45 . because @xmath41is tailored for the bar , the saturation of this parameter is more obvious ( more about this in  3.3 ) .",
    "second , making the _ inner _ halo less massive ( i.e. , less centrally concentrated ) , either by reducing the total halo mass or by increasing the size of the central core ( sequences @xmath35 and @xmath21 , respectively ) , results in a shorter rise time of the bar instability and hence brings up the bar earlier .",
    "third , increase in the mass of the inner halo and decrease in the outer one , has the most dramatic effect on the bar strength , substantially increasing the timescale of the bar instability .",
    "this hints at dm mass concentration being important rather than the total halo mass .",
    "varying the mass of the outer halo alone has a much smaller effect on the bar . finally , in all one - parameter sequences , the first @xmath38 or @xmath41 peak forms a progressively more extended plateau for less concentrated halos , respectively .",
    "again t16 is an exclusion .",
    "evolution in the sd model , showing the high frequency oscillations during @xmath46 .",
    "no smoothing has been applied to the data . ]    furthermore , @xmath38 and @xmath41 show high frequency variability in some models ( e.g. , figure  [ a2sd ] ) , being strongest in models sd , c30 and t22 .",
    "this variability can also be seen in @xmath43 and ps .",
    "evolution , the bar length and its pattern speed .",
    "this variability is limited to the time of the bar secular growth and dies out with saturation of the bar strength , @xmath38  and @xmath41 .",
    "these oscillations coincide in time with the presence of four short arms located close to the bar end , and two spirals in the outer disk beyond the bar radius .",
    "both sets of spirals have pattern speeds larger than that of the bar .",
    "the presence of more than one strong pattern of waves or modes in the disk can be the result of a non - linear mode coupling ( e.g. , tagger et al .",
    "1987 ; sygnet et al .",
    "1988 ) that gives rise to beat waves of a frequency @xmath47 and the azimuthal wave number @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ( azimuthal ) wave numbers of the interacting waves and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are their frequencies , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 s are their pattern speeds .",
    "this type of coupling has been observed and quantified in numerical simulations ( e.g. , masset & tagger 1997 ; martinez - valpuesta 2006 ) .",
    "debattista & sellwood ( 2000 ) has also observed the high frequency variability , but no quantitative analysis of the mode coupling was attempted .",
    "we test whether the bar and the outer two spirals , both @xmath3 modes , couple to give rise to the observed beat mode @xmath55 arms .",
    "we verify that the frequency @xmath56 of the @xmath55 mode is actually the sum of the frequencies of the interacting modes .",
    "table  [ m2m4spectra ] shows the frequencies @xmath57ps . ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath56 obtained with the mode coupling analysis , with an error of @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the pattern speed of the outer @xmath3 spirals .",
    "the measured frequency of the beat mode ( column 5 ) matches the frequency predicted by the non - linear coupling ( column 6 ) .",
    "we can explain the oscillations in @xmath38 as resulting from superposition of the major axis of the bar with the outer spirals , which are the second strongest mode ( after the bar itself ) present in the disk .",
    "the frequency @xmath61 of the @xmath38 oscillations must thus be equal to the frequency at which the spirals align with the bar @xmath62 .",
    "as can be seen from columns  7 and 8 , these two frequencies coincide within the error limits .",

    "is very similar , with the scatter of @xmath68 .",
    "although the details of the evolution of ps . differ from model to model , most importantly , often shows an ( anti)-correlation with @xmath38 and @xmath41 , as emphasized already by athanassoula ( 2003 ) .",
    "this is not always observed in cosmological simulations of disk evolution ( heller , shlosman & athanassosula 2007a ; romano - diaz et al .",
    "we find , however , that the anti - correlation between the bar strength and its pattern speed are limited to times prior to saturation of @xmath38 and @xmath41 . in ",
    "3.3 we show that this corresponds to times when the bar corotation radius lies within the disk . in three models , m70 , t22 and mt1 , the @xmath38ps .",
    "correlation is maintained even after the corotation leaves the disk  in these models the total @xmath0 of the disk is conserved during this time period of flat @xmath38 and ps . .    a close examination of ps .",
    "evolution in fig .",
    "[ rb_a2 ] reveals prolonged periods of ps .",
    "@xmath69 these are found either in the dynamical phase , prior to the first buckling but when the bar is already sufficiently strong ( sd , m70 , c57 ) , or during the late stage of secular evolution , especially pronounced in m70 , t22 and mt1 , and to a lesser degree in c57 .",
    "these latter cases are of most interest to us .",
    "a similar behavior was discussed before by valenzuela & klypin ( 2003 ) , who related it to an abnormally low dynamical friction of the bar against the background .",
    "we return to this issue in  3.6 .",
    "the semi - major axis of the bar , @xmath43 , is defined here as the radius where the bar equatorial ellipticity drops by @xmath70 off its peak .",
    "martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "( 2006 ) has tested this method by contrasting it with the most reliable way of determining the bar size using the last stable orbit supporting the bar ( martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "it seems robust when applied after the first maximum of the bar strength .",
    "the ellipticity of the bar at different radii is obtained by fitting ellipses to the isodensity contours in the face - on disk .",
    "figure  [ rcd ] displays the evolution of @xmath43 for all the models .",
    "similarly to the evolution of @xmath38 and @xmath41 , the bar length has initial period of a fast growth that reaches maximum , sometimes followed by a drop and subsequent sustained but slower rise , in most models .",
    "some models show a degree of saturation , toward the end .",
    "the first peak in @xmath43 always coincides in time with that of @xmath38 , except in the model t16 which lacks it .",
    "the peak in @xmath43 , however , is not as pronounced as that in @xmath38 and there are additional caveats . as in @xmath38 ,",
    "the initial growth varies with a model in such a way that , in models with the less centrally concentrated halos , the time span of the initial growth is shorter .",
    "furthermore , in some cases , additional drop in the bar length can be seen after some time of the secular growth , in the time range of @xmath71 .",
    "this drop appears to be related to the formation and disappearance of the _ ansae _ at each tip of the bar ( martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "the ansae eventually ` detach ' from the bar and becomes misaligned with its major axis .",
    "the transition to this misalignment results in a fast decrease of the bar length , taking place at @xmath72 for model sd , @xmath73 for m70 , 22 for c30 , 190 for c57 , 205 for t22 , and 165 for mt1 and mt2 .    in general , evolution in the bar length",
    "does not necessarily go in tandem with the changes in @xmath38 and is much less monotonic .",
    "for example , the drop in @xmath43 around @xmath72 in the sd model has no counterpart in the @xmath38 or @xmath41 evolution .",
    "of course , a stronger @xmath38 does not mean a longer bar , as seen in the last @xmath74 of the evolution of the sequence @xmath19 models .",
    "overall , the @xmath35 and @xmath34 sequences show a substantial dispersion in the bar sizes at the end of the simulations , while two other sequences end up with very similar bars . in all sequences ,",
    "the bars differ substantially during the intermediate times , especially after the first buckling time .",
    "the bar corotation radius @xmath1 has been computed using linear approximation ( the second column in fig .",
    "[ rcd ] ) .",
    "it grows with time as a consequence of the bar slowdown .",
    "@xmath1 keeps growing throughout the simulation , the exceptions are models m70 , t22 and mt1 , in which a plateau is reached .",
    "we use this characteristic radius in order to construct and follow the evolution of two important ratios , namely , @xmath1/@xmath43 and @xmath1/@xmath75 .",
    "the position of @xmath1 has a profound effect on the angular momentum transfer from the bar region to the outer disk and the dm halo ( athanassoula 2002 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "the dm particles at the corotation resonance are responsible for much of the angular momentum absorption by the halo .",
    "hence , the availability of halo or outer disk resonant particles is of the prime importance to the evolution of the bar . specifically , it is important to know whether @xmath1 lies within the stellar disk in our models at all times .",
    "we define @xmath75 as the disk radius which encloses 98% of the disk mass , and the evolution of the ratio @xmath1/@xmath75 is shown in figure  [ rcd ] . at the time of the bar formation , @xmath1/@xmath75 lies between 0.5 and 0.8 in all models .",
    "this ratio raises with time enough to move the corotation out of the disk with the exception of models m40 and t16 , where bars grow at the slowest pace during secular evolution .",
    "the growth of the bar seems to be sensitive to the moment at which @xmath1 reaches the disk edge  even if the growth continues , it proceeds at a slower pace .",
    "this change happens with a slight but measurable delay of @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , as noted before , the detachment of the ansae from the bar happens just before @xmath1/@xmath77 , which manifests itself by a sharp drop in the bar length .",
    "we pay a special attention to the bar evolution when @xmath1/@xmath77 .",
    "[ rcd ] displays an interesting behavior of this ratio in the above regime  it flattens with time before resuming its growth . analyzing this behavior , we find that as the @xmath1 moves outside the disk , some stellar particles become trapped at @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath3 spiral arms appear connecting the outer edge of the disk to these trapped particles .",
    "this is characteristic of all models where the above conditions exist . at @xmath78 , depending on the model , the spirals dissolve , and",
    "their particles form an amorphous cloud outside the disk .",
    "we return to this issue in  3.6 .",
    "the bar must lie of course inside its @xmath1 , because orbits outside @xmath1 do not support the bar .",
    "the morphology of the offset ( gas ) shocks in the numerical bars has been argued to constrain the ratio @xmath1/@xmath43 , restricting it to @xmath1@xmath79 ( athanassoula 1992 ; see also early work by van albada & sanders 1982 )",
    ". limiting our discussion of this ratio only to times when @xmath1/@xmath80 , we observe it dropping to the range @xmath81 after the first buckling , and staying generally below @xmath82 until the @xmath1 moves out of the disk .",

    "the @xmath5-body bars undergo phases of vertical buckling instability where transient asymmetries develop in the form of vertical oscillations of the equatorial plane and asymmetric thickening of the disk ( e.g. , combes & sanders 1981 ; combes et al .",
    "1990 ; pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; raha et al .",

    ", we detect at least a single phase of the vertical buckling .",
    "the buckling always happens simultaneously with the first @xmath38 drop ( e.g. , martinez - valpuesta & shlosman 2004 ) , which we confirm here . in all the model sequences , models with less centrally concentrated halo exhibit earlier and stronger buckling",
    "this happens because @xmath38reaches its first maximum earlier in these models .",
    "we do not find any clear correlations between the strength and time of the second buckling and the initial properties of the models . in all cases of repeated bucklings",

    "a clear correlation exists between these parameters  ` hotter ' disk impairs the bar growth in the secular phase of its evolution .",
    "note that m40 has the hottest disk in this stage , which would explain its anomalously slow bar growth .",
    "the same correlation against @xmath153 looks weaker and shows much larger dispersion of individual models .",
    "as mentioned before , in each separate sequence , the @xmath86 peak is stronger for models progressively less dominated by the halo .",
    "it is interesting that an anticorrelation between the initial central density of the halo and the strength of the first @xmath86 peak holds for our models altogether , regardless of which halo parameter is varied ( figure [ a1_hdens ] ) .",
    "moreover , the anticorrelation exists between the strength of the first @xmath86 peak and the ratio of the vertical - to - radial dispersion velocities , shown in figure  [ a1_sigzsigr ] .    to summarize",
    ", we confirm the previous results and quantify for the first time the dual role that the dm halos play in stellar bar evolution ( fig .  15 ) : more centrally concentrated halos slowdown dynamical processes in the disk , such as spontaneous bar instability and vertical buckling instability , as well as angular momentum redistribution in the system .",
    "they reverse this trend and facilitate the angular momentum transfer during the secular stage of bar evolution , following the buckling .",
    "we follow the angular transfer in the disk - halo systems by varying one basic parameter at the time in order to identify the sites and times of intense angular momentum flows .",
    "while we confirm the earlier works which have identified the ilr and corotation resonances as being primarily responsible for @xmath0 emission by the disk and absorption by the halo , we also find few caveats .",
    "first , the total angular momentum in the disk is largely conserved before the first buckling , thus @xmath0 flows across the corotation to the outer disk , although the amount is relatively low compared to the subsequent exchange .",
    "second , during the secular stage of the bar evolution , the angular momentum within the corotation resonance is largely conserved : the loss of @xmath0 by this region due to the gravitational torques on the bar ( resonant and non - resonant ) is compensated by the influx of new material , rich in @xmath0 , across the corotation , due to its outward motion .",
    "we also elaborate under what conditions this ` conspiracy ' law operates . in view of this",
    ", the ratio of @xmath1/@xmath75 emerges as important dynamic discriminator between various paths in barred disk evolution  its value can be determined if bar pattern speeds are known .",
    "third , we find that in some models the bar pattern speed stalls becoming nearly constant for prolonged time periods .",
    "all stellar bars which show this behavior have their corotation lying outside the disk .",
    "the disk - halo angular momentum exchange nearly vanishes and the halos display a weak _ emission _ of @xmath0 at the corotation and _ absorption _ at the ilr .",
    "while otherwise the bar pattern speeds are generally strongly decaying over the secular timescale , the addition of the gas component can modify this trend and soften the bar braking .",
    "we postpone our conclusions on this issue to paper  ii .",
    "we also find that @xmath1/@xmath43 ratio stays within 11.4 range , only occasionally spiking above it to @xmath82 .",
    "this behavior is typical after the first buckling and as long as @xmath1/@xmath158 .",
    "lastly , we confirm some known correlations ( figs .  16 and 17 ) between the basic parameters of the disk - halo system , e.g. , between the final bar strength and @xmath133 ratio .",
    "model m40 with the least concentrated halo does not follow this trend and we test the possibility that an additional parameter plays the role in this , i.e. , the dispersion velocities ratio @xmath159 . because m40 experiences the strongest buckling , the disk is heated up , which impairs the subsequent bar growth and can explain the behavior of m40 in the previous correlation",
    ". figs .  18 , 19 and 20 display new correlations between various parameters .",
    "the bar average growthrate over its secular evolution time decreases with increasing dispersion velocities in the disk , @xmath160 .",
    "we also show that in a closely associated relation  the angular momentum lost by the disk , @xmath161 , over the evolution correlates with the final bar strength . finally , the amplitude of the first buckling depends on the central density in the dm halo .",
    "these correlations will be followed up when the gas component is present .",
    "we expect substantial modifications in the relations between various basic parameters in the disk - halo system .",
