    "@xcite    silicene , a 2d honeycomb structure of si atoms with a buckled geometry , has been attracting great interest due to its physical properties such as possessing massless dirac fermions and large spin - orbit coupling resulting in an intrinsic band gap@xcite . the buckled structure of silicene is a consequence of sp@xmath0-sp@xmath1 hybridization of si atoms .",

    "<S> successful isolation of graphene from graphite opened a new era for material science and condensed matter physics . due to this remarkable achievement , there has been an immense interest to synthesize new two dimensional materials and to investigate their novel physical properties . </S>",
    "<S> silicene , form of si atoms arranged in a buckled honeycomb geometry , has been successfully synthesized and emerged as a promising material for nanoscale device applications . however , the major obstacle for using silicene in electronic applications is the lack of a band gap similar to the case of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , tuning the electronic properties of silicene by using chemical functionalization methods such as hydrogenation , halogenation or oxidation has been a focus of interest in silicene research . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we review the recent studies on the structural , electronic , optical and mechanical properties of silicene - derivative structures . since these derivatives have various band gap energies , they are promising candidates for the next generation of electronic and optoelectronic device applications . </S>"
