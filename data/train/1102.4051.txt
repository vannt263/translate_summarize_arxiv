    "let @xmath0 be a classical elliptic pseudodifferential operator ( @xmath8do ) of order @xmath1 acting in an @xmath14-dimensional hermitian vector bundle @xmath15 over a closed @xmath16-dimensional @xmath17 manifold @xmath2 .",
    "the construction of functions of @xmath0 was initiated by seeley , who in @xcite constructed and analysed the * complex powers * @xmath18 and showed that they are likewise classical @xmath8do s , under the assumption that @xmath0 has one ray of minimal growth @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is well - defined and is @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "they are useful in index theory for elliptic operators , and its generalizations , see also atiyah and bott @xcite .",
    "greiner @xcite defined the * heat operator * @xmath23 , when all rays with argument in @xmath4\\pi /2-\\delta , 3\\pi /2+\\delta",
    "[ \\,$ ] are rays of minimal growth ( for some @xmath24 ) ; it is likewise used in index theory . the * sectorial projection *",
    "@xmath25 is defined when @xmath0 has two rays of minimal growth @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , as a projection whose range includes the generalized eigenspaces for eigenvalues with argument in @xmath4\\theta , \\varphi [ \\,$ ] , and whose nullspace contains the generalized eigenspaces for eigenvalues with argument in @xmath4\\varphi , \\theta + 2\\pi [ \\,$ ] .",
    "burak @xcite studied it for @xmath0 equal to a realization @xmath29 of an elliptic differential operator @xmath30 with a boundary condition @xmath31 . a special case , the * positive eigenprojection * @xmath32 for a selfadjoint differential or pseudodifferential operator , came into focus with the works of atiyah , patodi and singer @xcite on index formulas for dirac operators with boundary conditions ; here @xmath32 equals @xmath33 ( defined to be zero on the nullspace of @xmath0 ) , and is a @xmath8do of order 0 since @xmath34 is classical elliptic of order @xmath35 by @xcite .",
    "wodzicki @xcite , in his studies of the spectral asymmetry , considered @xmath32 , as well as more general sectorial projections in cases where @xmath0 has two rays of minimal growth .",
    "the * logarithm * @xmath12 is defined when @xmath26 is a ray of minimal growth , and arises e.g.  as the derivative of @xmath18 at @xmath36 ; it was analysed in detail by okikiolu @xcite in connection with determinant formulas .",
    "the sectorial projection can be defined on smooth functions by the formula @xmath37 where the integration goes along the sectorial contour @xmath38 here @xmath39 is taken so small that 0 is the only possible eigenvalue in @xmath40 .",
    "detailed studies of @xmath41 were also made by wojciechowski @xcite for applications to the spectral flow for first - order operators , by nazaikinskii - sternin - shatalov - schulze @xcite for manifolds with singularities , and by ponge @xcite who wanted to give a simplified proof of the results of wodzicki .",
    "a recent paper of booss - bavnbek , chen , lesch and zhu @xcite gives an interesting observation , namely that there is a flaw in the arguments of the latter three papers , where the construction of @xmath6 is based on an application of to the terms in the symbol of @xmath20 : when the principal symbol @xmath3 has eigenvalues both with arguments in @xmath4\\theta , \\varphi [ \\,$ ] and in @xmath4\\varphi , \\theta + 2\\pi [ \\,$ ] , _ one can not obtain that @xmath9 is nonsingular along the curve @xmath42 for all @xmath43 _ ; there is a topological obstruction ( see the detailed explanation in @xcite ) . therefore a modified proof is needed .",
    "the reader is referred to the paper of booss - bavnbek et al .  for their strategy to circumvent the mentioned difficulty .",
    "they show that @xmath6 is @xmath44-bounded , when @xmath0 has a homogeneous principal symbol and a lower - order part in @xmath45 .",
    "they use their estimates to show that the norm of @xmath6 in @xmath44-spaces depends continuously on @xmath0 in a certain symbol / operator topology coarser than the full symbol topology .",
    "we shall here show , when @xmath0 is classical , that a very easy proof of the fact that @xmath6 is a classical @xmath8do of order 0 ( in particular @xmath44-bounded ) comes from the relation between the sectorial projection and logarithms of @xmath0 , as worked out in detail in gaarde - grubb @xcite .",
    "the present author s interest in the logarithm stems from reading the paper of scott @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath46 ; here @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the meromorphic extension of @xmath49 , and the residue of @xmath50 is as defined in okikiolu @xcite . since @xmath51 is also equal to the coefficient of @xmath52 in the expansion of the resolvent trace @xmath53 ( take @xmath54 for simplicity in this motivating explanation ) , this coefficient is related in the same way to @xmath55 .",
    "we wanted to give a direct proof of the last fact without having to calculate complex powers  for the sake of a generalization to boundary value problems where complex powers are difficult to use .",
    "the outcome is explained in @xcite , where the point of departure is a simple key lemma ( lemma 1.2 ) that shows how the logarithm comes into the resolvent trace calculations .",
    "this was used to show scott s formula directly from resolvent trace expansions , and the method was generalized to get similar results for manifolds with boundary .",
    "related observations were used to deduce the results in @xcite that we appeal to in section [ sec3 ] below .    assume in this section that @xmath0 is elliptic of order @xmath56 , having a ray of minimal growth @xmath26 for some @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the principal symbol @xmath3 , homogeneous of degree @xmath35 in @xmath10 for @xmath58 and smooth in @xmath59 , has no eigenvalues on @xmath60 when @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath20 exists and is @xmath21 for large @xmath62 on the ray , and since the hypotheses are valid also for rays with argument close to @xmath63 , one can assume that the ray is free of eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "the principal symbol of the resolvent is @xmath64 for @xmath58 , assumed to be extended in a smooth way for @xmath65 .",
    "the smoothing can be done for each @xmath62 e.g.  by multiplication of @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 denotes the strictly homogeneous symbol ) by an excision function @xmath68 ( a nonnegative @xmath17 function that equals 1 for @xmath58 , 0 near @xmath69 ) . in some cases it suffices to modify @xmath3 itself for small @xmath10 .",
    "the lower order terms @xmath70 in the symbol @xmath71 of @xmath20 are defined in local coordinates by recursive formulas known from @xcite ; they are finite sums of terms with the structure @xmath72 where the @xmath73 are homogeneous @xmath8do symbols independent of @xmath62 , the @xmath74 are positive integers with sum @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath20 has the full symbol @xmath76 .",
    "the terms @xmath70 are quasi - homogeneous ( homogeneous of degree @xmath77 in @xmath78 on each ray ) .",
    "now @xmath79 can be defined on smooth functions by @xmath80 here @xmath81 and @xmath82 are taken with branch cut @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is a contour in @xmath85 going around the nonzero spectrum of @xmath0 in the positive direction ; for precision we can take a laurent loop @xmath86 with @xmath39 so small that 0 is the only possible eigenvalue in @xmath40 .",
    "as shown in okikiolu @xcite , the symbol of @xmath87 is calculated in local coordinates from the resolvent symbol @xmath71 by integration with @xmath82 around the spectrum of the principal symbol @xmath88 .",
    "the terms @xmath70 contribute as follows : @xmath89^m)+\\log_\\theta ( [ \\xi ] ^{-m}p_m(x,\\xi ) ) = m\\log[\\xi ] + l_{\\theta , 0}(x,\\xi ) , \\\\",

    "it is a point here that the laurent loop used for @xmath12 is replaced by a closed curve ( by replacement of the rays outside a large @xmath95 by an arc with radius @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 is replaced by its limit 1 , since the spectrum is bounded at each @xmath59 .",
