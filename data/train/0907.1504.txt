    "@xmath41 is not indicative of the mass of the disk ; it is simply set to a particular value so as to match the observations .",

    "these sizes correspond to outer radii of 6000 and 3500 au .",
    "therefore , the outer radius is set to the average of these values ( 5000 au ) for both cores .",
    "@xcite also warned that sharc - ii is not sensitive to extended emission , so the reported values potentially underestimate the submillimeter size of the cores .",
    "however , the cores are separated by 50@xmath27 in the plane of the sky , which corresponds to 12500 au . then , it is reasonable to assume the outer radii do not exceed 6000 au .    for the dust properties , the opacities calculated by @xcite from the fifth column of table 1 in their paper ( so - called oh5 dust )",

    "one - dimensional models are not equipped to simulate the effects of a more realistic disk or scattering by dust grains .",

    "@xcite concluded , similarly , that the luminosity of the internal source is well - constrained by one - dimensional models .",
    "the results for @xmath82 of irs1 and irs3 are robust , but the inner radii are dependent on a variety of parameters related to the disk , dust opacities , and other two - dimensional effects .",
    "in addition , the disk is important to the overall fit of the model , but certain parameters of the disk , such as its outer radius , do not have a large impact on the best - fit models .",
    "a small disk outer radius ( 5 au ) has been adopted for the models of irs3 and irs1 , but the radius of the disk has little effect on the modelled sed .",
    "figure  [ fig - disks ] has the best - fit models for irs1 and irs3 ( with @xmath51 ) .",

    "though the disk spectra ( dashed line ) are markedy different , the sed of the protostar , disk , and envelope ( solid line ) are all about the same .",
    "clearly , the disk plays an important role in the mid - infrared portion of the sed ; in fact , these models underestimate the 24 @xmath1 m flux .",
    "however , further observations to constrain disk parameters and higher - dimensional models are needed for more certain conclusions .",
    "observations with sofia and herschel will provide better sampling of the sed , and submillimeter interferometry will be useful to constrain the disk masses and sizes in this system .    in comparison , @xcite found a relationship between @xmath82 and the flux at 70 @xmath1 m ; the relationship is found to be reliable within a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "based on the 70 @xmath1 m flux for irs1 , the derived @xmath82 is 1.1 l@xmath6 , while the model suggests @xmath112 l@xmath6 .",
    "the @xcite relationship derives 0.8 l@xmath6 for irs3 , while the model gives a range for @xmath82 from 0.4 to 2.2 l@xmath6 , depending on the density profile for the envelope .",
    "given the uncertainty in the @xcite relationship , the modeled luminosities are consistent with those derived from the 70 @xmath1 m flux .",
    "in conclusion , results for the internal luminosity are fairly robust .",
    "they are not affected by changes either in the disk or the effects due to scattering , even though these changes can drastically affect the near - infrared portion of the overall spectrum .",
    "the l1221 star - forming region presents an example of stars forming differently in very similar environments . l1221-smm1 and smm2 are , presumably , both part of the same region and are separated , in the plane of the sky , by approximately 50@xmath27 .",
    "their 850 @xmath1 m fluxes are identical , so their total masses are also similar , though their submillimeter sizes and , possibly , density profiles , are different . also , the two cores appear to be a part of the same molecular core , as in figure  [ fig - smm ] , and dark cloud @xcite . these two cores , because of their close proximity ( @xmath113 au ) , are likely to be affected by the same large - scale dynamical effects due to nearby stars and astronomical events ; they are also likely to have been born out of a very similar makeup of materials . in short , l1221-smm1 and smm2",

    "_    irs1 and irs3 , the dominant infrared sources in smm1 and smm2 , are clearly not as similar as their host cores .",
    "first , their luminosities are different .",
    "l1221-irs1 has an internal luminosity , including the disk and stellar components , of 2.6 l@xmath6 , while l1221-irs3 has @xmath114 or 0.4 l@xmath6 , depending on the density profile .",
    "the observed infrared luminosity ( with @xmath115 @xmath1 m ) for irs1 is 1.6 l@xmath6 and for irs3 is 0.4 l@xmath6 .",
    "the luminosity is the result of accretion onto the disk and star .",
    "since each core likely has similar temperature and turbulence , the accretion rates for irs1 and irs3 are probably very similar . because accretion luminosity is directly proportional to the protostar s mass ,",
    "irs1 is potentially about 4 times more massive than irs3",
    ".    however , irs3 , for the two best - fit models , has a range of possible luminosities from 0.4 to 2.2 l@xmath6 .",
    "additional observations in the wavelength range from 70 to 350 @xmath1 m ( such as with herschel ) would easily discern the appropriate internal luminosity since the models are quite different in this portion of the sed .",
    "current submillimeter ( 450 and 850 @xmath1 m ) maps , made with the scan map technique on scuba , have poor signal - to - noise ratios and are insufficient to determine the shape of the density profile for these cores .",
    "more sensitive observations of the extended submillimeter emission are needed to determine the density profile of the envelope @xcite .",
    "the envelopes inner radii of the l1221-irs3 and l1221-irs1 models are distinctly different .",
    "l1221-irs3 requires @xmath92 or 150 au ; l1221-irs1 needs a much larger inner radius ( 1000 au ) . two scenarios can explain this disparity .",
    "first , l1221-irs3 might be at a much earlier stage in its collapse , and the inner radius has not expanded as predicted by @xcite .",
    "another alternative is that the binary possibly in l1221-smm1 ( irs1 and irs2 ) could have evacuated the cavity of some fraction of the material .",
    "the separation of this binary is @xmath116 , which corresponds to 1750 au .",
    "@xcite found a similarly large inner radius for iras 16293 - 2422 and reported that the radius of the inner cavity was comparable to the centrifugal radius .",
    "@xcite reported a `` hole '' in the n@xmath2h@xmath3 emission , which could suggest a cleared out cavity in the center of the core .",
    "however , this could also be a chemical effect as discussed in @xcite and as observed by @xcite .    for iras 16293 - 2422",
    ", @xcite suggested a two - dimensional model that used a much smaller inner radius when outflow cavities were instituted and when the protostar was viewed down the outflow cavity .",
    "they found that the mid - infrared fluxes were greatly increased when observed down the outflow cavity .",
    "a similar scenario might apply for l1221 irs1 and irs3 .",
    "irs1 might be observed pole - on while irs3 is edge - on .",
    "however , because of the bipolar nature of irs1 @xcite , this is unlikely .",
    "the chief results of these models include these conclusions about the luminosities and envelope inner radii .",
    "the luminosity of each core is easily constrained with a one - dimensional model because most of the lumonisity is emitted in the far - infrared , which is largely unaffected by the central star s near - infrared spectrum ; the one - dimensional model is sufficient also because the re - radiated emission is thin .",
    "given the same data , even a more complex two - dimensional model should reach the same conclusions regarding the luminosity of irs1 and irs3 .",
    "prediction of the envelope s inner radii , on the other hand , is a less robust conclusion .",
    "the central protostar s spectrum does have a large impact on the inner radius required to match the data .",
    "however , the models do suggest that the inner radius of irs1 is much larger than the inner radius of irs3 .",
    "these results still hold even when the disk is altered or scattering is included in the model .    finally , irs1 and irs2 , the potentially binary companion to irs1 , show different seds .",
    "irs1 is detected at submillimeter wavelengths , while irs2 shows no clear evidence of long - wavelength emission .",
    "possibly , irs2 is more evolved than irs1 and has stopped accreting material from the surrounding envelope . perhaps , irs1 and irs2 exhibit such different properties because irs1 is dominating the accretion .",
    "in fact , this might be common in binaries that are close enough ; initially , one gets bigger and then dominates the accretion for the duration of their formation .",
