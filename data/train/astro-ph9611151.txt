    "this is the sixth in a series of papers describing _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations of the centers of the nearest galactic globular clusters with @xmath14 .",
    "the main scientific goals of this program are to measure the shape of stellar density profile in clusters and to understand the nature of evolved stellar populations in very dense regions by probing the variation in the mix of stellar types as a function of radius ( and hence stellar density ) . in this paper",
    ", we apply the techniques developed in our earlier planetary camera - i ( pc ) studies of 47  tuc ( guhathakurta et  al .",
    "1992 , hereafter referred to as paper  i ) and m15 ( yanny et  al .",
    "1994a , hereafter referred to as paper  ii ) to analyze data on m13 ( ngc  6205 ) .",
    "the globular cluster m13 is the least dense of the clusters analyzed thus far in this series of papers : m3 , 47  tuc , m30 , and m15 .",
    "the core of m13 has a projected stellar density of @xmath15  arcsec@xmath16 ( 300  pc@xmath16 ) for stars with @xmath17 .",
    "[ the easy detectability of this sample of bright stars ( upto 2  mag fainter than the horizontal branch ) makes it a convenient tracer of the relative surface density of clusters ( bolte et  al.1993 ) . ]",
    "by contrast , the density of m3 s core is @xmath18  arcsec@xmath16 ( 460  pc@xmath16 ) , the density of 47  tuc s core is @xmath19  arcsec@xmath16 ( 6000  pc@xmath16 ) , and the density in the central few arcseconds of m15 and m30 exceeds 30  arcsec@xmath16 ( @xmath20  pc@xmath16 ) .",
    "thus , the effect of crowding on the completeness and photometric accuracy of our m13 sample is less severe than in our earlier pc studies .",
    "the total absolute visual magnitude of m13 is @xmath21 , based on an estimated distance of 7.2  kpc ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "the cluster has a metallicity of @xmath22=-1.65 $ ] ( djorgovski 1993 ) and has an extended blue horizontal branch .",
    "in fact , m13 s horizontal branch is entirely on the blue side of the rr  lyrae instability strip and is significantly bluer than the horizontal branches of other clusters of comparable metallicity ( m3 and ngc  7006 ) , making it important in the search for the ( unknown ) second parameter that is thought to control horizontal branch morphology in globular clusters ( zinn 1986 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile of m13 is well fit by a king profile with a core of radius @xmath23 or 1.8  pc ( trager et  al .",
    "the cluster displays a significant amount of rotation with a maximum rotation speed of about 5@xmath24 km  s@xmath25 ( lupton et  al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "its relative proximity to the sun and large size have made m13 the subject of several studies in the last four decades ( savedoff 1956 ; baum et  al .",

    ", we present a color  magnitude diagram of post main sequence stars in m13 s core , study the relative radial distributions of the different evolved stellar populations in m13 and in two other dense clusters , and compare m13 s stellar luminosity function to a theoretical luminosity function .",
    "the conclusions of the paper are summarized in sec .",
    "two 60@xmath24s exposures of m13 were obtained in january  1991 with _ hst _",
    "s planetary camera - i , one through each of the f555w and f785lp filters .",
    "these bandpasses are roughly similar to the johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , respectively ( harris et  al .",
    "each pc image consists of a @xmath28 mosaic of @xmath29 ccd images ( pc5pc8 ) with a pixel scale of about @xmath30 .",
    "a greyscale representation of the f555w mosaic image of m13 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the field of view of the ccd mosaic image is @xmath31 with @xmath32-wide unusable strips between adjacent ccd frames .",
    "the telescope was pointed so that the center of the cluster was imaged on pc6 ; the pointing was identical for the f555w and f785lp exposures .",
    "the gain of the pc ccds is 7.6  electrons  adu@xmath25 and the read noise is about 13  electrons .",
    "the limited dynamic range of the analog - to - digital converters results in saturation of the raw ccd frames at the level of 4096  adu ( @xmath33electrons ) .",
    "details of the instrument may be found in griffiths ( 1989 ) , burrows et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and faber ( 1992 ) ; see paper  i for details of the instrumental configuration used for these observations .",
    "the images were processed via the standard space telescope science institute pipeline , the primary elements of which were overscan correction , bias ( `` zero '' ) subtraction , analog - to - digital bit correction , and flat fielding ( lauer 1989 ) .",
    "bad columns were visually identified and interpolated over .",
    "bias subtraction and flat fielding lower the saturation level to @xmath34  adu and cause the saturation level to vary by @xmath35% across the image . at most 5  pixels at the centers of the point spread function ( psf ) cores of the brightest stars in the f555w image ( @xmath36 ) and at most 2  pixels at the centers of the brightest stars in the f785lp image ( @xmath37 ) were saturated .",
    "saturated pixels were masked and subsequently ignored , and only the unsaturated wings of the saturated bright stars were used in the psf building process and in the psf fit to derive stellar photometry ( see below ) .",
    "the spherical aberration of the pre - refurbishment _ hst _ optics produces a spatially - varying psf with a complex shape ( fig .",
    "1 ) : a sharp core ( @xmath38 ) contains @xmath39% of the light while the rest is distributed in a faint , but complex halo extending out to @xmath40 ( burrows et  al .",
    "faint stars located within the psf wings of bright stars are measured reliably only if the model of the psf accurately accounts for the light in the wings of the bright star .",
    "papers  i and ii describe a star - finding , psf - building , and psf - fitting procedure based on daophot and daophot  ii ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) , designed to extract accurate stellar photometry under crowded conditions ( i.e. ,  where there is significant overlap between the psfs of stars in the image ) .",
    "the find routine of the daophot package , a matched filter convolution technique , was used to find stars on the f555w and f785lp images . the daophot detection list for each ccd image was manually edited to remove spurious detections ( e.g. ,  the psf tendrils of bright stars ) and to add stars fainter than the find threshold , based on an inspection of the residual image , the difference between the original image and the best fit psf template ( see below ) .",
    "the reader is referred to papers  i and ii for details .",
    "the number of bright stars in the pc image of m13 suitable for building a psf template is small ( 1520)at least 30  bright , relatively isolated stars per ccd image are needed to reliably build a quadratic template . because of this , it was deemed best _ not _ to follow the full psf - building process described in paper  i. we instead experimented with a pre - existing set of psf templates derived from our earlier 47  tuc , m15 , and m3 images obtained in march  1991 , april  1991 , and july  1992 , respectively ( papers  i , ii , and iii , respectively ) .",
    "each set consists of eight quadratically variable templates ( as defined in the daophot  ii package ) , one for each of ccds pc5pc8 and for each of the f555w and f785lp images .",
    "each of the three pre - existing sets of psf templates was fit to the stars in the m13 detection list using daophot  ii s psf - fitting program allstar . while the photometric lists were roughly similar for the three sets of templates , the m3 psf templates produced residual images ( original minus psf template ) that were slightly smoother than those obtained with the other two sets of templates .",
    "in fact , the m13 residual image is comparable in quality to the residual images of the clusters in our earlier studies in which the psf template was derived in an internally consistent fashion ( i.e. ,  from stellar images in the dataset ) .",
    "the eight m3 psf templates ( pc5pc8 , f555w and f785lp ) were used to make a simultaneous fit to all the resolved stars on the corresponding m13 pc ccd images , yielding positions and instrumental magnitudes in the process ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "an f555w vs @xmath41 color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) was obtained for each of the four pc ccds .",
    "these cmds were used for matching the zeropoints of the f555w and f785lp instrumental magnitude scales between the four ccds , using as reference points the brightness of the horizontal branch ( hb ) and the color of the red giant branch ( rgb ) at the level of the hb .",
    "typical inter - ccd zeropoint adjustments amounted to @xmath42  mag , consistent with the values found in our earlier studies ( papers  i and ii ) .",
    "the f555w simulations that we carried out for our earlier 47  tuc study ( paper  i ) can be used to assess the degree of completeness and level of photometric accuracy in the m13 dataset .",
    "the difference between the apparent distance moduli of the two clusters ( difference between their @xmath43 ) is @xmath44  mag , with m13 being fainter .",
    "most of this difference is attributed to the difference in their distances from the sun [ @xmath45  kpc ; @xmath46  kpc ; @xmath47  mag ] , since neither cluster is appreciably reddened [ @xmath48  mag ; @xmath49  mag ] .",
    "the shape of the observed @xmath0-band stellar luminosity function ( lf ) of post main sequence stars is very similar for the two clusters , after one accounts for the 0.9  mag shift between their apparent @xmath0 magnitude scales .",
    "the _ hst _ pc exposure times , @xmath50s and @xmath51s , were chosen to exactly compensate for this magnitude difference : @xmath52  mag . since",
    "sky noise is unimportant in these short exposures , this implies that the ratio of signal to ( read ) noise is practically identical for two stars of a given _ absolute _",
    "@xmath0 magnitude in the two clusters .",
    "as described in paper  i , we have carried out simulations in the f555w band with a variety of projected stellar densities : 2000 , 1000 , and 500  simulations ( these numbers refer to the approximate number of stars brighter than the main sequence turnoff within the @xmath15  arcmin@xmath3 field of view of a single pc ccd ) .",
    "the 2000/f555w  simulation mimics the stellar surface density in the core of 47  tuc ; the projected stellar density in m13 s core is about an order of magnitude lower .",
    "the 1000/f555w and 500/f555w  simulations indicate that the m13 f555w dataset is @xmath53% complete for stars with @xmath54 ( shifting the magnitude scale in fig .",
    "10 of paper  i by + 0.9  mag ) .",
    "this is consistent with m13 s observed stellar lf in the f555w band , which continues to rise to @xmath55 , but drops sharply due to incompleteness beyond @xmath56 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "it is evident from figure  2 that the magnitude at which incompleteness sets in is independent of radial distance from the cluster center ; this is due to the fact that m13 s core covers a large fraction of the area of the four - ccd pc mosaic so that the stellar surface density ( or the degree of crowding ) only varies by a factor of  4 across the pc image .    the rms photometric uncertainty in the f555w band is expected to be @xmath57  mag for stars with @xmath54 , with a somewhat non - gaussian error distribution ( see figs .  5 and 6 of paper  i",
    "this is in rough agreement with estimates of the photometric error derived from the observed width of m13 s rgb and hb , assuming these have zero intrinsic spread ( fig .",
    "systematic photometric error due to psf template mismatch in m13 is comparable to that in our earlier cluster studies and simulations judging from the smoothness of the m13 residual images and from the width of its bright rgb ( for which the scatter is dominated by systematic error ) .    the intrinsic shape of the rgb  specifically , the fact that its color gets redder towards the bright end  implies that the brightness ratio between the brightest ( bright rgb ) stars and faintest ( subgiant / turnoff ) stars is greater in the @xmath1 band than in the @xmath0 band .",
    "detection and photometry of faint stars are affected by the proximity of brighter stars ; these crowding effects are somewhat worse in @xmath1 than in @xmath0 .",
    "results from the earlier 47  tuc 1000/f785lp  simulation indicate that incompleteness in the matched sample of f555w and f785lp detections sets in about 1  mag brighter than in the sample of ` f555w - only ' detections ( fig .",
    "10 of paper  i ) .",
    "note that m13 s bright rgb does not curve over to the red as much as 47  tuc s since its metallicity is lower than that of 47  tuc ; consequently , the results from the 47  tuc f785lp simulation may not be applicable to m13 in detail .",
    "figure  2 shows the lfs of the f555w - only sample and the matched f555w and f785lp sample in the central part of m13 .",
    "the lf of the matched sample turns over due to incompleteness at @xmath58 , nearly 1  mag brighter than in the f555w - only lf . we return to a discussion of the shape of m13 s lf in sec .",
    "the psf - fitting procedure described in sec .  2.2 yields a list of positions and f555w brightnesses for 6436  stars in m13 down to @xmath59 within the 1.25  arcmin@xmath3 area of the pc mosaic .",
    "the dataset includes stars out to @xmath60 , but only annuli with @xmath61 are completely contained within the pc image . of the 6436  f555w detections ,",
    "2877 have a corresponding star within @xmath62 on the f785lp image .",
    "this list of 2877  matched f555w and f785lp detections appears to be complete to about @xmath63 , and hardly any stars with @xmath64 are detected on the f785lp image ( sec .",
    "2.3 , fig .  2 ) .",
    "the wf / pc - i instrumental calibration constants ( faber 1992 ) are used to convert the counts ( in adu ) reported by the psf - fitting program into instrumental f555w and f785lp magnitudes .",
    "these were then converted to johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes , respectively , using the color transformation equations obtained by harris et  al .",
    "the zeropoints of the f555w and f785lp magnitude systems are roughly equal to those of johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and there are small but non - zero color terms .",
    "thus , it is only possible to derive magnitudes on the johnson system for those stars detected in _ both _ f555w and f785lp .",
    "figure  3 is a @xmath0 vs @xmath65 cmd of all stars matched in f555w and f785lp in our m13 sample .",
    "the division into different stellar types is only approximate and is based on the gross features of the distribution of stars in the cmd .",
    "the data extend below the main sequence turnoff ( @xmath63 , @xmath66 ) , although they are increasingly incomplete below it .",
    "the rgb gets only slightly redder towards its bright end , and the hb droops by almost 3  mag in @xmath0 and extends quite far to the blue ( @xmath67 ) ; these characteristics of m13 s cmd are more or less in keeping with its relative low metallicity : @xmath22=-1.65 $ ] ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "a sparse group of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars is visible at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "a small number of blue straggler stars ( bss ) lie in the region slightly brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff : @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ". the large scatter at the faint end ( @xmath72 ) is mostly a result of photometric error .",
    "we have compared the @xmath0 vs @xmath65 cmd of m13 s core ( fig .",
    "3 ) with ground - based photometry in the @xmath73 and @xmath0 bands ( guarnieri et  al .",
    "1993 ; sandage 1970 ) and in the @xmath73 and @xmath1 bands ( stetson 1996 ) of stars at a variety of radii in the cluster .",
    "while a star - by - star comparison is not possible , a comparison of several fiducial points in the cmd ( e.g.  rgb color at various levels , hb magnitude and color ) indicates that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitude zeropoints we have adopted agree with ground - based photometry to within @xmath74  mag .",
    "for the most part however , our study relies on relative photometry of stars and not on absolute photometry .    the positions and brightnesses of a subset of 25  bright ( @xmath75 ) , relatively isolated stars in the core of m13 are listed in table  1 .",
    "all positions are on the equinox  j2000 coordinate system , and are measured relative to the reference star  u ( id#5540 ) whose coordinates are :    @xmath76    the coordinates of star  u ( accurate to about @xmath77 ) and the position angle of the wf / pc - i images ( @xmath78 ; see fig .  1 ) are based on the _ hst _ guide star catalog .",
    "we adopt gould & yanny s ( 1994 ) prescription for the pixel scale ( @xmath79  pixel@xmath25 ) and inter - ccd offsets and rotations ( fig .  1 ) of the pc .",
    "the bright stars a  y listed in table  1 are marked on the greyscale image of the cluster in figure  1 and serve as a `` finding chart '' to facilitate matching our dataset to others .",
    "the full version of table  1 is presented in the aas cd - rom series , volume  x , 199x .",
    "it contains all 6436  stars detected in the f555w band ( with id#s sorted by right ascension ) , including the 2877  stars matched in the f555w and f785lp lists for which f555w , f785lp , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 magnitudes are provided .",
    "the @xmath0 vs @xmath65 cmd of m13 presented in figure  3 shows a sparse collection of bss candidates in the region between the main sequence turnoff and the drooping tail of the extended blue hb . about 15  of these bss candidates lie roughly where the continuation of the upper main sequence would be , if it were to be extrapolated beyond ( i.e. ,  brighter and bluer than ) the turnoff .",
    "these 15  stars are reasonably distinct from the hb and turnoff stars in the cmd and are to be regarded as `` likely '' candidates .",
    "an additional 10  bss candidates are indicated by the dotted lines in figure  3 .",
    "these 10  stars lie close to m13 s hb or subgiant branch ; some of them may be hb or subgiant stars that have been scattered away from their fiducial locations in the cmd due to measurement error .",
    "thus , these additional 10  bss are to be considered `` possible '' candidates .",
    "unless otherwise mentioned , we use the term bss candidates to refer to all 25  stars .",
    "the actual number of bsss in the region of m13 covered by our pc image is likely to be in the range 1525 . as discussed in sec .",
    "2.3 , the list of @xmath0 and @xmath1 detections should be @xmath80 complete down to the main sequence turnoff which makes it unlikely that a bss would go undetected .",
    "our bss selection criterion ( fig .",
    "3 ) , while consistent with the criteria used in our earlier studies ( papers  i  iii ) and in previous ground - based studies ( cf .  bolte et  al .",
    "1993 ; stetson 1994 ) , is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "in particular , it excludes the less extreme bsss  those with @xmath65 colors within 0.3  mag and/or @xmath0 magnitude within 0.5  mag of the turnoff .",
    "it is likely that we compensate ( possibly overcompensate ) for the exclusion of less extreme bsss from our sample by the including a few `` spurious '' objects  i.e .",
    ",  turnoff , subgiant , and hb stars that have scattered into the bss region due to photometric error . a comparative study of 47  tuc s dense core shows that , of the complete sample of bsss detected in the ultraviolet study of paresce et  al .  ( 1991 ) ,",
    "only about half are extreme enough to appear as definite bsss in a @xmath0 vs @xmath65 cmd , clearly separated from the turnoff and subgiant branches ( paper  i ) .",
    "the specific frequency of bss in m13 is calculated according to the definition of bolte et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) : @xmath81 . although m13 s hb is not truly horizontal in the cmd ( fig .  3 ) , it has a well defined brightness of @xmath82 at the location of the rr  lyrae instability region before drooping to fainter @xmath0 magnitudes at the blue end .",
    "there are 343  subgiants in the m13 pc image that fulfil the criterion for the normalizing population .",
    "the specific frequency is @xmath7 if we count only the 15  definite bss candidates in m13 s core , and @xmath83 if we count all 25  candidates .",
    "the @xmath6 poisson error in the specific frequency is @xmath84 , but systematic errors in the bss sample selection are likely to be somewhat larger .",
    "table  2 compares m13 s bss frequency to that of a few other globular clusters ( listed in order of decreasing stellar density ) that have been studied recently . as pointed out by sosin & king ( 1995 ) , it is interesting that the bss frequency in this representative set of clusters spans only a range of a factor of  three , with a mean value of @xmath85 , despite the @xmath86  range in stellar density among the clusters .",
    "m13 s bss frequency is also within this relatively narrow range .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the radial density distributions of the various types of evolved stars found in m13 s core .",
    "the cluster core fills most of the field of view of the pc mosaic , so our sample spans only a small range of stellar space densities ( roughly a factor of  8) .",
    "we divide the sample of stars into four ( projected ) radial bins : ( 1 )  @xmath87 , ( 2 )  @xmath88 , ( 3 )  @xmath89 , and ( 4 )  @xmath90 , around the cluster center .",
    "we define the cluster center to be the centroid of the light distribution as measured on a ground - based image of m13 :    @xmath91    these coordinates are within @xmath92 of the cluster centroid coordinates quoted by djorgovski ( 1993 ) , well within the measurement errors .",
    "the limiting radii of the four  radial bins have been chosen so that each bin contains the same number of stars with @xmath93 .",

    "there are no striking differences in the mix of stellar types between annuli .",
    "the innermost bin appears to be somewhat deficient in hb stars ( quantified below ) .",
    "the turnoff portion of the cmd has slightly less scatter and a higher number of stars as one moves radially outwards , a result of improved photometric accuracy and increased degree of completeness in the sparser parts of the cluster .",
    "table  3 lists the number of stars of each type in the four radial bins .",
    "the division of the post main sequence stars in m13 into various stellar types is defined by the dashed lines in figure  3 .",
    "the total number of stars increases towards larger radii due to the increased probability of detecting faint turnoff stars and main sequence stars ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "faint rgb stars and subgiants make up the bulk of the normalizing population used to define the limiting radii , so it is not surprising that their numbers are roughly constant across the four bins .",
    "there is no radial gradient in the fraction of bright rgb or bss stars either .",
    "poisson errors are very large for the bss population ; small changes in the bss fraction as a function of radius ( smaller than a factor of 23 ) would be undetectable in our sample of 25  candidates .",

    "the 90% confidence limit on the core radius of m13 s rgb stars is @xmath99 .",
    "the hb stars , on the other hand , have a core radius of @xmath100 . it is perhaps not surprising that trager et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) found a best fit core radius of @xmath101 for the overall surface brightness distribution ( intermediate between the rgb and hb core radii ) , since rgb stars and hb stars together account for most of the visual light in m13 .",
    "subtle ( but real ) radial gradients in the stellar populations of globular clusters may be masked by large statistical errors in the measurement of the stellar density that result from having a limited number of stars in the core of a single cluster .",

    "the bsss are significantly more centrally concentrated than the normalizing faint rgb / subgiant population : the probability that the two populations are drawn from the same radial distribution is only @xmath128 ; this is largely driven by the numerous , strongly centrally concentrated bsss in m30 .",
    "the hb stars in the combined sample show some evidence for central depletion relative to the faint rgb / subgiant stars .",
    "the depletion is significant at the 85% confidence level in the three - cluster sample ( @xmath97 ) , and at the 97% level in the five cluster - sample ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "is interesting to note that each of the the five dense globular clusters that we have studied in our _ hst _ program so far displays a weak ( and only marginally significant in each individual cluster ) central hb deficiency : m13 ( fig .",

    "( 1992 ) , studies of m14 , m15 , and ngc  6397 suggest that red hb stars ( those redder than the rr  lyrae gap ) may be more centrally concentrated than blue hb stars ; our samples indicate no obvious difference between the degree of depletion of red hb stars ( 47  tuc ) and blue hb stars ( m30 , m13 ) in cluster cores .",
    "furthermore , a wfpc2 study of m15 shows that the red and blue hb stars in this cluster have similar radial density distributions ( guhathakurta et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the cause of the central hb depletion in dense globular cluster cores remains a mystery .",
    "it is unlikely to be due to mass segregation between hb stars and the more massive subgiants because : ( 1 )  the dynamical time scale for mass segregation in the cores of these dense clusters , @xmath130yr ( djorgovski 1993 ) , is larger than the time spent by a star in the hb phase , @xmath131yr ( lee & demarque 1990 ) ; and ( 2 )  standard stellar evolution theory ( lee et  al",
    ".  1990 ) predicts only a small amount of mass loss in the rgb phase and hence only a small difference in mass between an hb star ( @xmath132 ) and a subgiant ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the central hb depletion is not an artifact of a higher rate of misidentification of hb stars near the cluster center than in the outer parts .",
    "firstly , for relatively bright stars such as hb stars , the photometric errors are fairly small ( @xmath134  mag ) and do not vary appreciably with distance from the cluster center ( especially in the case of m13 where the stellar density does not vary drastically over the area of the pc image ) .",
    "secondly , the section used to define hb stars in the cmd ( cf .",
    "3 ) is large enough that hb stars are unlikely to scatter out of the region because of photometric error .",
    "figure  7 shows the lf of evolved stars in the pc image of m13 ( open bold symbols ) .",
    "the lf is plotted versus stellar f555w magnitude , and not the transformed johnson @xmath0 magnitude which requires both f555w and f785lp measurements . as discussed in sec .",
    "2.3 , the sample of f555w - only detections from which the lf is derived is more complete at the faint end than the sample of `` matched '' f555w and f785lp detections .",
    "incompleteness sets in fainter than @xmath55 in the f555w - only sample ; at brighter magnitudes , the lf shape appears to be independent of radial distance from the center of m13 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we therefore combine data from the entire pc image to minimize poisson error ( @xmath6 error bars are shown in fig .  7 ) . even though detection in the f555w band is the only criterion used to select stars for the lf , in practice , the brightest stars are detected in both f555w and f785lp bands . for reasons explained below ,",
    "we use a color cut ( @xmath135 ) to exclude hb stars and to restrict the bright part of the lf ( @xmath136 ) to only rgb and agb stars .",
    "the dashed line in figure  7 shows a theoretical model for the lf of an old ( 16  gyr ) , metal - poor ( @xmath22=-1.66 $ ] ) stellar population ( bergbusch & vandenberg 1992 ) .",
    "these parameters have been chosen to match the age ( @xmath137  gyr ",
    "carney et  al .  1992 ) and metallicity ( @xmath138=-1.65$]djorgovski 1993 ) of m13 .",
    "the absolute visual magnitude scale in the model lf has been converted to the apparent f555w magnitude scale using a distance modulus of @xmath139  mag and a galactic extinction of @xmath140  mag for m13 ( djorgovski 1993 ) .",
    "the model lf has been normalized to match the observed number stars at @xmath141 , ( conservatively ) assuming that the m13 sample is only 90% complete for stars of this apparent brightness ( see sec .",
    "the bergbusch ",
    "vandenberg model does not include the hb phase of stellar evolution ; hence we have excluded hb stars from m13 s lf before comparing it to the model lf .",
    "fainter than @xmath141 , the observed lf falls below the model lf due to the effect of incompleteness , as predicted by our image simulations .    a comparison between m13 s lf and the bergbusch  vandenberg model lf ( fig .",
    "7 ) shows that the model underpredicts the number of bright rgb stars relative to the subgiants . specifically , there are twice as many bright rgb stars in the range @xmath14215 in m13 than predicted by the model , a @xmath143 difference ( taking only poisson error into account ) .",
    "note , the m13 lf includes both rgb and agb stars at its bright end ( since the pc photometry is not accurate enough to allow a clear distinction between these two classes ) whereas the bergbusch ",
    "vandenberg model lf includes only rgb stars . in order to resolve the difference between the model and data , roughly half the bright stars in m13 ( @xmath144 )",
    "would have to be agb stars .",
    "this seems unlikely since agb stars typically make up a small fraction of the bright end of the lf in globular clusters : @xmath145 ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ; buzzoni et  al .",
    "1983 ; buonanno et  al .  1985 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have obtained a ground - based cmd of stars in m13 with sufficient photometric accuracy to distinguish agb stars from bright rgb stars , and this indicates a comparably small agb fraction at the bright end of m13 s lf .",
    "the discrepancy in the number of bright rgb stars between m13 and the model is not a result of incorrect normalization of the model ; the model is in excellent agreement with the data for the faint rgb , subgiant , and turnoff stars ( @xmath14618.5 ) .",
    "the horizontal offset of the model lf ( along the f555w magnitude scale ) , derived from the quoted m13 distance modulus and line - of - sight visual extinction , is also in good agreement with the data judging from the sharp upturn in both lfs at the base of the giant branch at @xmath147 .",
    "moreover , varying the metallicity of the model over the range , @xmath148\\lesssim-1 $ ] , and its age over the range , @xmath149 , does not make a significant difference to the quality of the fit .",
    "discrepancies between the relative numbers of rgb stars and turnoff stars have also been noted in the clusters m92 ( stetson 1991 ) and m30 ( bolte 1994 ) . unlike the case of m13 , where there is only a discrepancy for the brightest rgb stars , these other two clusters display an excess of faint as well as bright rgb stars relative to turnoff stars .",
    "larson et  al .  ( 1995 ) suggest that a modification of the canonical stellar model to include the effects of internal rotation might boost the lifetimes of faint rgb stars and subgiants enough to resolve the discrepancy for such stars ; their models , however , do not examine the effects of rotation in bright rgb stars ( those at or above the hb level ) and therefore do not address the problem of m13 s lf directly .",
    "interestingly , a recent study of m5 shows good agreement between the observed lf and that predicted by the canonical bergbusch  vandenberg model ( sandquist et  al .",
    "a systematic study of the lfs of evolved stars in globular clusters is needed to determine what fraction of clusters display this rgb excess and what global property of the cluster might be correlated with the excess .",
    "a thorough investigation of model parameter space is currently in progress ( vandenberg 1996 , private communication ) . for now",
    ", the question of what causes the rgb discrepancy remains unanswered .",
