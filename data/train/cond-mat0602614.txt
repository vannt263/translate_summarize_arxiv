    "it is now over a decade since bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in a dilute atomic gas was first realised.@xcite in this time remarkable progress has been made in the control and manipulation of these ultra - cold gases .",
    "one possibility offered , through the use of light fields in the form of the optical lattice,@xcite by this control is to reduce the dimensionality of the system . by increasing the confining potentials in one or two directions it is possible to freeze out these degrees of freedom creating , effectively , two-@xcite or one - dimensional@xcite gases .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) gas is of particular interest . in general 2d systems",
    "often display unique properties , often remarkably different from those of the comparable bulk system .",
    "for example , the 2d electron gas , subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field , displays the rich phenomena of the , essentially single particle , quantum hall effect and , the even more remarkable , many body fractional quantum hall effect@xcite with the physical manifestation of , the uniquely two - dimensional , fractional statistics@xcite in the quasiparticle excitations .",
    "more specifically , it is well known that the uniform 2d bose gas does not undergo bec@xcite at finite - temperature .",
    "the interacting homogeneous 2d gas does still undergo a normal - superfluid phase transition@xcite at finite - temperature however , with an order parameter which is only locally phase coherent - the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) phase .",
    "experimental evidence for this phase transition has been demonstrated in liquid helium thin film@xcite , superconducting josephson - junction arrays@xcite and in spin - polarized atomic hydrogen@xcite .    in the trapped 2d bose gas",
    "the density of states is modified sufficiently that , for the ideal gas , condensation into a single state can occur at finite temperature.@xcite it has been demonstrated however that long - wavelength phase fluctuations may destroy the global phase coherence of the condensate at a temperature still below the ideal gas critical temperature , @xmath0 for bec with only a _ quasi - condensate_@xcite present .",
    "the connection between such a quasi - condensate and the correlated vortex - pair plasma of the bkt phase proves unclear however and forms the basis of the material we attempt to address in the remainder of this paper .",
    "in order to determine at what temperature thermal activation of vortex - antivortex pairs becomes thermodynamically favourable , we consider the helmholtz free energy , @xmath1 of @xmath2 bosonic particles of mass @xmath3 spatially confined in 2d and via the harmonic potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radial trap frequency .",
    "we assume the existence of a macroscopic ground state condensate wavefunction @xmath6 , which also serves to describe the order parameter of the system in the bec phase . isolating the energy contribution due to the condensate , @xmath7 , the total internal energy of the system",
    "may be written as @xmath8 .",
    "the required condensate energy @xmath7 is determined by the functional @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the constant coupling parameter for the particle interactions , and @xmath11 denotes the number of particles in the condensate.the internal energies for topologically distinct order parameter configurations are then calculated computationally.@xcite the entropy contribution to the free - energy difference is due to the multiplicity of order parameter configurations containing a pair of vortices . the statistical weight @xmath12 , is obtained by allowing one vortex to reside anywhere within the thomas - fermi radius , the partner vortex then having @xmath13 available nearest neighbour sites . assuming the radius of the area occupied by each vortex to be of the order of the healing length , @xmath14",
    ", we can obtain an expression for the configurational energy difference @xmath15 .",
    "the free energy for each configuration can now be evaluated , yielding a critical temperature for the thermal activation of vortex - antivortex pair creation . for the experimental parameters of the oxford experiment@xcite we obtain a critical temperature @xmath16 although the precise value is dependent upon the total number of atoms and decreases monotonically with @xmath2 .",
    "of course taking the thermodynamic limit in this case , which one would need to do if one were to try to claim that this is a phase transition , is slightly complicated by the presence of the trap .",
    "this indicates that there are three distinct regions for the harmonically trapped , ultra - cold , dilute bose gas . at low temperatures",
    "there is a phase coherent bec with a coherence length comparable with the system size as shown by gies and hutchinson.@xcite at higher temperatures , where the coherence length reduces and off - diagonal order decays algebraically , it becomes thermodynamically favourable to form correlated vortex - antivortex pairs , which we take as a signature of a bkt - like phase . at temperatures approaching the ideal gas critical temperature , @xmath0 the off - diagonal order decays exponentially . at this point",
    "the vortex pairs unbind ( although this is not present in our free energy model ) and superfluidity is destroyed yielding a thermal gas .",
    "this is what is traditionally referred to as the bkt transition .",
    "to confirm these conclusions finite temperature classical field simulations@xcite were performed . in the classical field approach",
    "the system is divided into classical and incoherent regions , determined by the occupation of single particle modes .",
    "highly occupied ( classical ) modes are described by the projected gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath17\\psi(\\bfr , t ) + g { \\cal p}\\left\\{|\\psi(\\bfr , t)|^2\\psi(\\bfr , t)\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the projector , @xmath18 , restricts evolution of the classical field to within its subspace .",
    "the low occupation , incoherent modes are described using the semiclassical hartree - fock approximation , with the classical and incoherent regions being taken to be in thermal equilibrium with one another . at the lowest temperatures no vortices",
    "are present in the system .",
    "these first emerge , as the temperature is increased , in the low density regions at the edge of the cloud . at higher temperatures it becomes possible for vortex - antivortex pairs to nucleate closer to the trap centre .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig.(1 ) which is at a temperature of @xmath19 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows a single frame of the full simulation with vortices and antivortices shown by the black crosses and white dashes .",
    "these are identified through the singularity in the phase as determined from the simulation .",
    "the region containing a slight density dip ( due to thermal fluctuations ) bounded by the box is then blown up into panel ( b ) .",
    "subsequent time frames are then shown for this expanded region in panels ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "it can clearly be seen how a vortex - antivortex pair forms in the low density fluctuating region , then separates and stabilises . at later time this pair goes on to annihilate again .",
    "the temperature at which vortex - antivortex pairs begin to form in the classical field simulations is entirely consistent with the free energy calculations described above and a strong corroboration of the interpretation of the regime with only algebraic off - diagonal order as a bkt - like phase .",
    "further details of the classical field simulations for the 2d gas and comparison with recent experiments@xcite can be found in ref .  .",
    "in conclusion we have demonstrated , both using a free energy argument and using classical field simulations that there exist three distinct regions in the phase diagram of the ultra - cold , harmonically confined 2d bose gas . at very low temperatures compared to the ideal gas condensation temperature @xmath0 the gas forms a phase coherent bec . at temperatures of order @xmath20 it becomes thermodynamically favourable for correlated vortex - antivortex pairs to form .",
    "the system remains superfluid with algebraic off - diagonal order .",
    "this corresponds to a bkt - like superfluid phase . at higher temperatures , approaching @xmath0 , the vortex pairs unbind",
    ", the off - diagonal density matrix decays exponentially and the superfluid phase is destroyed yielding a thermal gas .",
    "this upper transition is what corresponds to the bkt transition in the uniform system .",
    "we would like to thank tapio simula for his contributions to this work .",
    "we are also indebted to the marsden fund and to the university of otago for financial support ."
