    "the production of jets with large transverse momenta @xmath1 in @xmath2 reactions with both photons being quasi - real has been studied at tristan @xcite for quite some time and more recently at lep @xcite .",
    "the presence of a large scale in the process allows perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "these calculations are available at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd @xcite and the agreement of the predictions with experimental data is good ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "( 161,62 ) ( 0,-8 ) ( 70,-4 ) ( 0,10 )    in order to reliably understand the hadronic structure of the photon also the process should be studied where one of the incoming photons has a large virtuality @xcite .",
    "the scattering of virtual on real photons , which is the analog to deep inelastic electron - proton ( @xmath3 ) scattering , can be achieved in @xmath0-colliders by a single - tag experiment , i.e. , one of the leptons is detected under a certain angle and the other escapes unobserved in the beampipe .",
    "single - tag experiments have recently been performed at the lep storage rings and the results of these measurements are expected in the near future @xcite .",
    "some studies of deep inelastic electron photon jet cross sections in leading - order ( lo ) , i.e.  @xmath4 , have been done in @xcite .",
    "a nlo qcd calculation of jet cross sections in @xmath5 collisions for relatively small virtualities up to @xmath6 gev@xmath7 has been performed in @xcite , but without considering the longitudinal photon polarization .",
    "the simplest diagram contributing to the deep inelastic electron photon jet cross section in lo is the quark parton model ( qpm ) diagram , see figure 1 .",
    "the real photon and the virtual photon couple directly to the charge of the bare quark , producing two final state jets .",
    "this so - called direct process can be distinguished from resolved processes , where the real photon serves as a source of partons ( quarks and gluons ) that interact with the virtual photon .",
    "in addition to the high @xmath1 jets from the hard scattering , the resolved contribution is accompanied by a `` spectator jet '' ( or photon remnant jet ) with small @xmath1 .",
    "it has been discussed in @xcite that both contributions are of the same order in the strong coupling constant .",
    "note , that the contribution involving the resolved real photon is traditionally called _ single - resolved _ in @xmath2 scattering . we will call this contribution simply _ resolved _ for ease of writing .",
    "similar to @xmath3-scattering , one motivation for studying deep - inelastic @xmath8-scattering is to obtain information on the partonic , especially gluonic , structure of the real photon from the resolved contribution of the cross section .",
    "furthermore , the interplay between the hadronic and the point - like part of the real photon structure function can be studied .",
    "as is well known , only qualitative conclusions can be drawn from lo calculations , since the results strongly depend on the factorization scale , especially in the resolved contribution .",
    "furthermore , no dependence on jet definitions , present in the experimental data , can be seen in the lo results .",
    "only the nlo cross sections , which contain an additional parton in the final state , depend on the jet definition .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to the qpm diagram , i.e. , the @xmath9 contributions , consist of the radiation of a gluon in the final state and of the virtual corrections .",
    "the quark - antiquark pair emitted from the real photon can produce a collinear singularity in the real corrections , which has to be factorized and absorbed into the real photon structure function . in this way , the direct and resolved contributions achieve a dependence on the factorization scale @xmath10 .",
    "thus the direct and resolved cross sections are not independent from each other in nlo qcd and the clear distinction mentioned above for the lo case does no longer hold .",
    "the nlo corrections to the subprocesses of the resolved contribution are equal to those obtained in deep inelastic @xmath3-scattering , where the photon interacts directly with the partons from the proton .",
    "the singularities in the resolved contribution that do not cancel after adding the real and the virtual corrections are absorbed into the photon structure function , as for the direct case . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on the calculation of the @xmath9 terms in the direct part of the cross section for both , the transverse and the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon . for separating the singular phase - space regions we apply the phase - space slicing method @xcite .",
    "the resolved contributions are taken from the @xmath3-scattering case , which has been calculated using the phase - space slicing method in @xcite .",
    "the paper is set out as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss cross sections in deep inelastic @xmath8 scattering in general and review the lo cross sections .",
    "we proceed in section 3 by performing the nlo calculation of the direct contribution for both polarizations of the virtual photon .",
    "the techniques for doing the calculations follow essentially those layed out in @xcite .",
    "some results for inclusive single- and dijet cross sections are presented in section 4 for kinematic conditions and energies encountered at lep1 and lep2 .",
    "section 5 contains the summary and an outlook .",
    "the results of the analytic calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "to fix the notation we start by writing down the process of jet production in @xmath0 scattering : @xmath11 we are interested in the case where one lepton radiates a virtual and the other a real photon .",
    "of course , it does not matter which of the leptons radiates the virtual photon , but for definiteness we suppose this to be the positron .",

    "the variable @xmath23 gives the momentum fraction of the real photon in the electron .",
    "the cross section @xmath24 for the process described above is given by the convolution @xmath25 here , @xmath26 describes the spectrum of the real photons emitted from the electron according to the weizscker - williams approximation @xcite , which in its simplest form reads @xmath27 the electron mass is @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the maximum scattering angle of the electron .",
    "the function @xmath30 is the parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the real photon which describes the probability to find a parton with momentum @xmath31 inside the real photon , where @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the direct process is included in formula ( [ xsec ] ) by viewing the photon as a parton with momentum fraction @xmath33 .",

    "@xmath38 stands for the appropriate tensor describing the photon - photon scattering amplitudes ( for a definition see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "note , that the lepton tensor of the electron radiating the real photon integrated over the azimuthal and polar angle of the outgoing electron gives the weizscker - williams formula ( [ ww ] ) .",

    "although it is theoretically safer to choose smaller values of @xmath81 , because of the omission of the @xmath204-terms , it is from the practical ( numerical ) point of view convenient to have larger values of @xmath81 , since the compensation between the two - body and the three - body parts are then smaller and the statistical errors are likewise smaller",

    "3 we also compare the nlo cross section with the lo result ( the dash - dotted line ) , which does not depend on @xmath81 . for the lo cross sections we have chosen the same two - loop @xmath206 formula and the same pdf as in the nlo cross sections , so differences between the lo and nlo results are due to differences in the lo and nlo matrix elements .",
    "the nlo curves are smaller than the lo order ones and the corrections are around 10% for the smaller @xmath173 region . for the larger @xmath173 region the nlo corrections reduce the born result by approximately 30% .    the resolved contributions are also independent of @xmath81 , which we explicitly checked but do not show here .",
    "similar tests of the resolved contribution have already been performed for the case where the real photon is substituted by a proton in @xcite .",
    "having checked the pole terms , the limiting behavior and the @xmath81-independence , which shows that the program for the numerical calculations is reliable , we proceed by discussing the dependences of the cross sections on the renormalization- and factorization - scales in lo and nlo .",
    "this has been done before in the limiting case of @xmath199 , i.e. , for @xmath2-scattering , in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "4 a and b we show the variation of the nlo direct and lo resolved cross sections with the factorization scale @xmath10 ( normalized with @xmath196 ) for the same kinematic conditions and regions of virtuality as in fig .  3 .",
    "in both regions , the lo resolved cross section ( dotted line ) grows by about 50% , going from @xmath207 to @xmath208 .",
    "this dependence is due to the factorization scale dependence of the photon structure function alone , since the lo partonic cross sections are finite and no initial state singularities have to be treated .",
    "the dependence of the lo resolved contribution is completely canceled by the nlo direct contribution , shown as the dashed line .",
    "the sum ( full line ) shows no dependence on the factorization scale in the plotted region .",
    "the dependence of the nlo direct contribution on the factorization scales comes in through the absorption of the singular terms in the initial state into the photon structure function , as explained in section 3.3 .",
    "the resolved nlo corrections to the partonic cross section do depend on the factorization scale , in contrast to the resolved lo partonic cross sections .",
    "one sees however only a small overall dependence on the factorization scale of under 4% by going from @xmath207 to @xmath208 , when the nlo direct and resolved contributions are added to obtain the full nlo cross section ( we do not show these plots here ) .",
    "the renormalization scale dependence of the resolved cross section is reduced by going from lo to nlo , as has been shown in @xcite . for the direct cross section ,",
    "the lo result is independent of the renormalization scale , because the strong coupling constant @xmath206 does not appear in the qpm diagram .",
    "thus , the nlo cross section is actually lo in the strong coupling .",
    "as we will see later on , the nlo correction to the lo direct process is small and thus the renormalization scale dependence , which is only seen in the nlo corrections , will likewise be small .",
    "in addition , the running of the strong coupling is compensated by including the virtual graphs in the nlo direct process .",
    "we found only a small variation of the nlo direct cross section of about 10% between the smallest and largest scale considered here .",
    "thus , summing the direct and resolved contributions we find a reduced renormalization scale dependence due to the reduced dependence of the resolved components .",
    "we start this section by discussing the single - jet inclusive @xmath209-distributions @xmath210 in the region @xmath211 , integrated over @xmath201 gev for lep1 conditions .",
    "we show the direct and resolved cross sections and their sum in fig .  5 and look at the longitudinal and transverse contributions to the individual direct and resolved components in fig .",
    "6 and fig .  7 .",
    "5 a , b , c and d show the direct ( dashed ) and resolved ( dotted ) contributions as well as their sum ( full line ) for the four @xmath173 values defined above , @xmath174 and @xmath175 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the direct contributions are peaked at @xmath212 and are quite symmetric , which is to be expected , since we are in the @xmath18 c.m.s .",
    "a small asymmetry arises from the mass of the virtual photon .",
    "the resolved cross section is peaked at @xmath213 and shows a stronger asymmetry .",
    "this is due to the additional integration over the momentum fraction of the parton in the resolved photon .",
    "the peak is in the positive @xmath209-region , since the virtual photon is chosen to travel along the positive @xmath214-axis .",
    "four all @xmath173 values , the direct contribution is the dominant one , although the resolved becomes more important for larger @xmath173 values and in general for positive @xmath209 s .",
    "this shows that the direct contribution falls of slightly stronger with rising @xmath173 compared to the resolved contribution .",
    "the reason for this is the relatively low cut on @xmath197 , where the resolved component is expected to be more important .    in fig .",
    "6 a , b , c and d we show the direct cross section , split up into the transverse and longitudinal parts , compared to the full lo cross section .",
    "the transverse part ( dashed line ) is denoted by @xmath215 and is obtained from the full cross section by setting @xmath216 , so only the g - part is in @xmath215 .",
    "likewise , the longitudinal part @xmath217 ( dotted line ) is obtained by setting @xmath218 .",
    "the sum of both gives the full direct contribution , denoted here as @xmath219 ( full line ) .",
    "for the plots a and b , the transverse part is dominant , although the longitudinal part is important , especially in the central region .",
    "one observes a plateau around @xmath220 for the transverse part , which becomes a dip for the two larger @xmath173-values in fig .",
    "6 c and d. this local minimum is compensated in the full direct cross section @xmath219 through the longitudinal component which has a maximum around @xmath212 . from this one",
    "sees that the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon gives an important contribution to the direct cross section .",
    "the nlo direct cross section @xmath219 is compared to the lo cross section ( dash - dotted line ) , containing both polarizations of the virtual photon . in fig .  6",
    "a and b , the lo and nlo cross sections can not be distinguished in the logarithmic plot , but the nlo curves lie around 5 - 10% lower than the lo ones , which is consistent with the results shown fig .  3 .",
    "for the two larger @xmath173-values , the nlo curve lies approximately 25% below the lo cross section in the central @xmath209-region .",
    "furthermore , the nlo cross section has a slightly stronger fall - off towards the edges of the @xmath209 phase space than the lo cross section .",
    "the dip observed in the nlo transverse cross section is already present in lo , which we do not show here .",
    "it is not present in photoproduction and for the smaller @xmath173 values . in",
    "lo the reason for the local minimum at larger @xmath173 is twofold .",
    "first , the interference term in the born matrix elements @xmath221 is negative and sharpley centered around @xmath220 . for small @xmath173",
    "this contribution is negligable , but going to larger virtualities the subtraction of the interference term in the central @xmath209-region leads to the observed local minimum .",
    "second , the individual terms @xmath222 and @xmath223 in the born matrix elements are peaked on opposite sides , slightly away from @xmath220 . for @xmath224",
    "their sum still gives a curve with an absolute maximum at @xmath220 . at larger",
    "@xmath173 values though the maxima of the terms @xmath222 and @xmath223 move to larger ( smaller ) @xmath209-values , so that their sum leads to a slight local minimum near @xmath220 .",
    "these effects , observed in lo , have their correspondences in nlo .",
    "next , we consider the resolved components , again separated into transverse and longitudinal parts , in fig .",
    "7 a , b , c and d. the curves are labeled as in fig .",
    "the transverse part of the cross section is dominant for all @xmath173 values and the longitudinal part even becomes less important for the larger virtualities and is one order of magnitude smaller compared to the transverse part at @xmath225 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the longitudinal part is peaked more in the positive @xmath209 region for the smaller @xmath173 values than the transverse part and it is shifted to the smaller @xmath209 s for the larger @xmath173 values . here , also the lo curves and the nlo curves are not distinguishable in the logarithmic plots of fig .  7 a and b. for the resolved cross section ,",
    "the nlo cross sections are around 10% larger than the lo cross sections , in contrast to the direct case , where the nlo cross sections lie lower than the lo cross sections .",
    "it should be mentioned that the transverse part of the gluon induced resolved cross section also shows a dip near @xmath220 , for the same reasons as in the case of the transverse direct cross section .",
    "however , the gluon induced process gives only a rather small contribution to the resolved cross section and the transverse part of the quark induced cross section does not have a local minimum in the @xmath209-distribution , since here the interference term is positive .    in connection with the @xmath197-distributions it will turn out to be important that the direct cross sections have a larger plateau in the central @xmath209-region than the resolved components , which are peaked more sharply around @xmath213 and fall off stronger towards the edges of the @xmath209 phase space .",
    "the effect is stronger for the larger @xmath173 values .",
    "this is due to the special form of the transverse direct cross section , which is relatively broad already for the smaller @xmath173 values and has two maxima at the edges of the @xmath209 spectrum for the larger @xmath173 values .",
    "we further mention that the @xmath209 distributions become narrower when integrated over @xmath226 for larger values of @xmath227 due to the stronger kinematical restrictions in the region of larger @xmath197 .",
    "this holds for both , the direct and the resolved components .",
    "we now come to the @xmath197 distributions of the single - jet inclusive cross section @xmath228 for the same @xmath173-values as in fig .",
    "the rapidity is integrated over the central region @xmath229 in the hadronic c.m.s .",
    "we show the nlo distributions of the direct ( dashed ) and the resolved ( dotted ) component of the cross section and the sum ( full line ) of the two in the @xmath197-range @xmath230 $ ] gev in fig .  8",
    "a , b , c and d.    as can be seen , the direct component is the dominant one in the whole @xmath197-range for the two smaller @xmath173-values .",
    "in addition the resolved contribution falls off stronger with rising @xmath197 than the direct component .",
    "the stronger fall - off of the resolved component holds for the two larger @xmath173-values as well , but here the resolved component becomes comparable to the direct contribution for the smallest @xmath197 values .",
    "the flattening of the @xmath197 distribution of the direct component for the small @xmath197 s , already visible at @xmath231 gev@xmath7 , even leads to a crossing of the direct and resolved cross sections at @xmath232 gev for the largest @xmath173-value , fig .  4d , so that the resolved is larger than the direct .",
    "this behavior is a purely kinematical effect and stems from the fact that the @xmath209-integration is restricted to @xmath229 .",
    "we have mentioned above that the direct cross sections have a broader @xmath209-spectrum than the resolved ones .",
    "cutting on @xmath209 thus leads to a stronger cut on the direct than on the resolved components .",
    "the effect becomes more important for the larger @xmath173 values because the direct contributions have an even broader @xmath209-spectrum for @xmath231 and @xmath175 gev@xmath7 than for the smaller @xmath173 values , as already discussed above .",
    "since the @xmath209-spectra become narrower for the larger @xmath197 s , the cut on @xmath209 does no longer have such a large effect on the direct cross section and the direct component again dominates over the resolved component for the larger @xmath197 s .    as a main result we find that the resolved contribution is small compared to the direct contribution and therefore there is little hope to learn about the parton distributions , especially the gluon distributions , in the photon from deep - inelastic @xmath8-scattering .",
    "furthermore , the resolved component is largely suppressed for larger transverse energies @xmath197 , which agrees with the expectation that the point - like part of the real photon is dominant at large scales .",
    "we now come to the presentation of inclusive dijet cross sections for lep1 and lep2 energies . in fig .",
    "9 a , b , c and d we show the dijet cross section @xmath233 integrated over @xmath234 $ ] as a function of the transverse momentum of the trigger jet @xmath235 for the same @xmath173-values as in fig . 5 ( a)(d ) for lep1 conditions .",
    "we see much the same behavior as in the case of the single - jet cross sections , namely that the direct component is dominant and the resolved one falls off stronger with rising @xmath197 . as in the single - jet case",
    ", the direct cross section has a flattening towards the smaller @xmath197 s for the largest @xmath173 values , which seems to be even stronger in the two - jet case .",
    "the reasons for the flattening are the same as discussed above in the single - jet case , only here we have a cut on the @xmath209 s of both jets , which increases the effect of the @xmath209-cuts and thus the flattening of the @xmath197 distributions .    in fig .",
    "10 a , b , c and d the dijet cross section integrated over @xmath234 $ ] is shown in the range @xmath236 $ ] gev for lep2 conditions , i.e. , for slightly different antitagging conditions than for lep1 and for larger energies .",
    "therefore , the cross sections are larger than for the dijet cross sections for lep1 .",
    "all other conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "the phenomenon of the flattening turns out to be quite obvious here . as can be seen in fig .",
    "10 d , the direct contribution even has a slight maximum in the @xmath197 spectrum for @xmath237  gev and by going to smaller @xmath197 values the direct cross section becomes smaller .",
    "this is compensated by the rise in the resolved component , so that the sum of the direct and the resolved component rises by going to smaller @xmath197 s .",
    "we have presented the calculation of the direct component of jet production in deep inelastic electron - photon scattering in nlo qcd .",
    "transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the virtual photon have been taken into account .",
    "the singular regions of phase space have been extracted with the help of the phase - space slicing method .",
    "the initial state singularities of the real photon have been absorbed into the pdf of the real photon .",
    "cross sections have been obtained by adding the direct and resolved real photon parts .",
    "the spectrum of the real photon has been approximated by the weiscker - williams formula .",
    "we have shown that the scale dependence of the nlo cross sections are reduced .",
    "we are thus in the position to compare nlo calculations to experimental data for deep inelastic @xmath8 scattering , taken e.g.  at lep1 and lep2 .",
    "we have presented @xmath209- and @xmath197-distributions of inclusive one- and two - jet cross sections for lep1 and lep2 energies for photon virtualities between @xmath6 and @xmath175 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the direct component gives the dominant contribution to the cross section .",
    "the nlo direct cross sections are about @xmath238% smaller than the lo cross sections for @xmath239 gev@xmath7 and about the same size for @xmath173 around @xmath238 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the longitudinal part of the cross section plays an important role and can contribute up to 50% in the full cross section .",
    "it is of course possible to study the influence of different parametrizations of the real photon pdf on the resolved cross section .",
    "we have refrained from showing such comparisons here , because the resolved plays only a minor role in the cross sections .",
    "furthermore it is possible to study the effects of cuts on other observables , such as @xmath240 or the invariant jet mass , in nlo , as has been done for @xmath2-scattering in @xcite .",
    "however , data on these kind of variables are not expected in the near future .",
    "it has been discussed recently in @xcite in connection with @xmath3-scattering at hera that contributions from the resolved virtual photon might contribute to jet cross sections up to virtualities of @xmath241  gev@xmath7 .",
    "the resolved virtual photon contributions have to be taken into account when terms of the type @xmath242 become large and have to be absorbed into a virtual photon structure function , as is the case for @xmath243 .",
    "the subtraction procedure has been worked out in @xcite for the case of @xmath3-collisions and is very similar for @xmath8-reactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have not taken into account the effects of a resolved virtual photon .",
    "however , the case of @xmath3-scattering corresponds to the small resolved contribution in the @xmath18 case .",
    "the resolved virtual photon effects in the direct cross section will presumably be small for larger @xmath173 values and it is not clear how the double - resolved contribution , i.e. , the contribution where the real and the virtual photons are both resolved , behaves .",
    "we will extend our studies presented here in the future to include the effects of resolved virtual photons .",
    "i am grateful to g.  kramer for discussions and comments on the manuscript .",
