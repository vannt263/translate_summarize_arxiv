    "we denote its boundary by @xmath5 and we consider the following boundary value problem ( abbreviated to bvp in the sequel ) @xmath6    we assume in the sequel that @xmath7 and @xmath8 is non identically equal to zero .    for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we introduce the vector space @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the space of temperate distributions on @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the fourier transform of @xmath15 . equipped with its natural norm @xmath16 @xmath17 is a banach space ( it is noted that @xmath18 is merely the usual sobolev space @xmath19 ) . by using local charts and a partition of unity , we construct @xmath20 from @xmath21 similarly as @xmath22 is built from @xmath23 .    to carry out our analysis , we need solutions of the bvp with some smoothness . in order to give sufficient conditions on the coefficient @xmath24 guaranteeing this smoothness , we set @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a given constant .    by theorem 2.3 in @xcite",
    ", observing that @xmath28 is continuously embedded in @xmath29 , we obtain that , for any @xmath30 , the bvp has a unique solution @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , @xmath32 the constant @xmath33 above can depend only on @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath34 .",
    "usually , in a bvp modeling the problem of detecting corrosion damage by electric measurements the boundary @xmath5 consists in two parts : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 being two disjoint open subsets of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath36 corresponds to the part of the boundary accessible to measurements and @xmath37 is the inaccessible part of the boundary where the corrosion damage can occur .",
    "henceforth , we assume that the current flux @xmath8 satisfies @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath24 in is known as the corrosion coefficient and it is naturally supported on @xmath37 .",
    "this motivate the introduction of the following subset of @xmath39 : @xmath40    we are interested in the stability issue for the problem consisting in the determination of the boundary coefficient @xmath24 from the boundary measurement @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an open subset of the accessible sub - boundary @xmath36 . in the sequel , we assume that @xmath42 does not meet @xmath43 : @xmath44    we need to extend the usual notion of a starshaped domain .",

    "+ in this case , any two points in @xmath45 can be connected by a broken line consisting of at most @xmath49 line segments . obviously , the case @xmath50 corresponds to the usual definition of a starshaped domain .",

    "we notice that the convexity of @xmath5 implies the convexity at each of its points , but the converse is not true in general .",
    "we aim in the present work to prove the following theorem .",
    "[ theorem1.1 ] there are three positive constants @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfying : for any @xmath59 , we find @xmath60",

    "we note that in the above mentioned works the difference of @xmath66 is only estimated in a compact subset of @xmath67 . however , there is a counterpart in estimating @xmath66 in the whole @xmath5 .",
    "the stability estimates in @xcite and @xcite are of single logarithmic type , while the estimate in theorem [ theorem1.1 ] is of double logarithmic type .",
