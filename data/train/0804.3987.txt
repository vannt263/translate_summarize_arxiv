    "the dynamics of a self - gravitating system is defined by two fundamental time scales .",
    "the _ dynamical time _",
    ", @xmath0 , is the time required for a typical star to cross the system .",
    "it is also the time scale on which the system establishes virial equilibrium , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the kinetic and gravitational potential energies of the system , respectively .",
    "a convenient formal definition in terms of conserved quantities is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total mass of the system and @xmath6 is the total energy . in virial equilibrium",
    ", this expression assumes the more familiar form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the virial radius and we have added for reference some astrophysically relevant scales . in this review we confine our attention to systems in virial equilibrium ( neglecting such interesting cases as merging star clusters or colliding galaxies ) , and take eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamical ] ) as our working definition of the dynamical time scale .",
    "the second fundamental time scale is the relaxation time , @xmath9 , on which two - body encounters transfer energy between individual stars and cause the system to approach thermal equilibrium .",
    "spitzer ( 1987 ) derives the local expression @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath12 is the mean stellar mass , @xmath13 is the density , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for a system in virial equilibrium . replacing all quantities by their cluster - wide ( `` half - mass '' ) averages",
    ", we obtain the half - mass relaxation time @xmath16    a natural distinction can be drawn between `` collisionless '' systems , whose long relaxation times mean that they will not undergo significant internal dynamical evolution during the age of the universe , and `` collisional '' systems , which evolve significantly in less than a hubble time .",
    "galaxies fall into the former category  a typical relaxation time in a modest galactic spheroid , with mass @xmath17 and radius",
    "@xmath18 kpc is @xmath19 yr . star clusters and some galactic nuclei fall into the latter category  a globular cluster , for example , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 pc",
    "has @xmath22 yr .",
    "the median relaxation time of the galactic globular cluster system is @xmath23 gyr ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "we further limit our discussion here to collisional systems , in which substantial internal evolution is expected on time scales less than the age of the universe .",
    "self - gravitating systems are inherently unstable , and no final equilibrium state exists for a star cluster .",
    "the escape of high - velocity stars ( evaporation ) and the internal effects of two - body relaxation , which transfers energy from the inner to the outer regions of the cluster , precipitate the phenomenon known as _ core collapse _ ( antonov 1962 , cohn 1980 ) . during this phase ,",
    "the central portions of the cluster accelerate toward infinite density while the outer regions expand .",
    "the process is readily understood by recognizing that , according to the virial theorem , a self - gravitating system has negative specific heat  reducing its energy causes it to heat up .",
    "hence , as relaxation transports energy from the ( dynamically ) warmer central core to the cooler outer regions , the core contracts and heats up as it loses energy . the time scale for the process to go to completion ( i.e. a core of zero size and formally infinite density ) is @xmath24 for a system of identical masses , and significantly less in the case of a broad spectrum of masses ( inagaki 1985 ; portegies zwart and mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : cluster ] compares the appearance of pre- and post - collapse systems .    0.2 in    in systems with a mass spectrum ,",
    "two - body interactions accelerate the dynamical evolution by driving the system toward energy equipartition , in which the velocity dispersions of stars of different masses would have @xmath25 .",
    "the result is _ mass segregation _",
    ", where more massive stars slow down and sink toward the center of the cluster on a time scale ( spitzer 1969 ) @xmath26    thus , a collisional stellar system inevitably evolves toward a state in which the most massive objects become concentrated in the high - density central core , and this process can occur in less than a hubble time . from an astrophysical point of view , these `` most massive objects '' are the most interesting objects in the system  black holes , neutron stars , massive white dwarfs , and binary star systems . dynamical evolution provides a natural and effective mechanism for concentrating astrophysically interesting objects in regions of high stellar density , thereby promoting interactions among them .",
    "these interactions not only create potentially observable objects , such as x - ray binaries , millisecond pulsars , and ( perhaps ) sources of gravitational radiation , but in many cases can also play important roles in the dynamics of their parent system . binary stars , for example , act as heat sources to the stellar system through superelastic encounters with other cluster members ( heggie 1975 ) , ultimately halting and even reversing core collapse ( mcmillan 1991 ; mcmillan and hut 1994 ) . at the same time , they greatly increase the effective cross sections for close encounters and collisions between stars and remnants .",
    "the pursuit of a full understanding of the dynamical evolution of collisional stellar systems therefore drives us to study not just the gravitational dynamics of the stars themselves , but also the physics of stellar interactions and collisions , and the processes driving the stellar and binary evolution of the resulting objects .",
    "the past decade has seen groundbreaking advances in both hardware design and software development and integration , all of which have been crucial in advancing our understanding of this field .",
    "here we describe a few of the computational techniques currently in use .",
    "consistent with our growing understanding of the importance of stellar and binary interactions in collisional stellar systems , the leading programs in this area are the various `` kitchen sink '' packages that combine treatments of dynamics , stellar and binary evolution , and stellar hydrodynamics within a single simulation . of these ,",
    "the most widely used are the @xmath27-body codes nbody ( aarseth 2003 ) and kira ( e.g. portegies zwart 2001 ) , and the monte - carlo codes developed by giersz ( giersz 1998 ; see also giersz and heggie 2008 ) , freitag ( freitag 2006 ) , and by rasio and coworkers ( e.g. fregeau 2003 ) .",
    "these codes differ principally in their handling of the large - scale dynamics , employing conceptually similar approaches to stellar and binary evolution and collisions .",
    "all use approximate descriptions of stellar evolution , generally derived from look - up tables based on the detailed evolutionary models of eggleton ( 1989 ) or hurley ( 2000 ) .",
    "they also rely on semi - analytic or heuristic rule - based treatments of binary evolution , conceptually similar from code to code , but significantly different in detail . in most cases ,",
    "collisions are implemented in the simple `` sticky - sphere '' approximation , where stars are taken to collide ( and merge ) if they approach within the sum of their effective radii .",
    "the effective radii may be calibrated using hydrodynamical simulations , and mass loss may be included in some approximate way .",
    "freitag s monte - carlo code uses a more sophisticated approach , interpolating encounter outcomes from a pre - computed grid of sph simulations ( freitag and benz 2005 ) .",
    "small - scale dynamics of multiple stellar encounters , such as binary and higher - order encounters , may be handled by look - up from precomputed cross sections or  more commonly  by direct integration , either in isolation or as part of a larger n - body calculation .",
    "codes employing direct integration may also include post - newtonian terms in the interactions between compact objects .",
    "@xmath27-body codes incorporate detailed descriptions of stellar dynamics at all levels , using direct integration of the individual ( newtonian ) stellar equations of motion for all stars .",
    "monte - carlo methods are designed for efficient computation of relaxation effects in collisional stellar systems , a task which they accomplish by reducing stellar orbits to their orbital elements  energy and angular momentum ",
    "effectively orbit averaging the motion of each star .",
    "relaxation is modeled by randomly selecting pairs of stars and applying interactions between them in such a way that , on average , the correct rate is obtained .",
    "this may be implemented in a number of ways , but interactions are generally realized on time scales comparable to the orbit - averaged relaxation time . as a result , monte - carlo schemes can be orders of magnitude faster than direct @xmath27-body codes .",
    "joshi ( 2000 ) report an empirical cpu time scaling of @xmath28 for core - collapse problems ( compared with @xmath29 for @xmath27-body methods , as discussed below ) . to achieve these speeds ,",
    "however , the geometry of the system must be simple enough that the orbital integrals can be computed from a star s instantaneous energy and angular momentum . in practice , this limits the approach to spherically symmetric systems in virial equilibrium , and global dynamical processes occurring on relaxation ( or longer ) time scales .",
    "the major attraction of @xmath27-body methods is that they are assumption - free , in the sense that all stellar interactions are automatically included to all orders , without the need for any simplifying approximations or the inclusion of additional reaction rates to model particular physical processes of interest .",
    "thus , problems inherent to monte - carlo methods , related to departures from virial equilibrium , spherical symmetry , statistical fluctuations , the form of ( and indeed the existence of ) phase space distribution functions , and the possibility of interactions not explicitly coded in advance , simply do not arise .",
    "the price of this is computational expense .",
    "each of the @xmath27 particles must interact with every other particle a few hundred times over the course of every orbit , each interaction requires @xmath30 force calculations , and a typical ( relaxation time ) run spans @xmath30 orbits ( see eq .  [ eq : trtd ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 scaling of the total cpu time means that , even with the best time - step algorithms , integrating even a fairly small system of , say , @xmath32 stars requires sustained teraflops speeds for several months ( hut 1988 ) .",
    "the technological solution now in widespread use is the `` grape '' ( short for `` gravity pipe '' ) series of machines developed by sugimoto and co - workers at tokyo university ( ebisuzaki 1993 ) . abandoning algorithmic sophistication in favor of simplicity and raw computing power , these machines achieve high speed by mating a fourth - order hermite integration scheme ( makino and aarseth 1992 ) with special - purpose hardware in the form of highly parallel , pipelined `` newtonian force accelerators '' which implement the computation of all interparticle forces entirely in hardware .",
    "operationally , the hardware is simple to program , as it merely replaces the function that computes the force on a particle by a call to the hardware interface libraries ; the remainder of the user s @xmath27-body code is unchanged .",
    "the effect of grape on simulations of stellar systems has been nothing short of revolutionary . today , grapes lie at the heart of almost all detailed @xmath27-body simulations of star clusters and dense stellar systems .",
    "recently , graphics processing units ( gpus ) have begun to achieve speeds and price / performance levels previously attainable only by grape systems ( see belleman 2008 for a recent gpu implementation of the grape interface ) .",
    "it appears that commodity components may be poised to outpace special - purpose computers in this specialized area of computational science , just as they have already done in general - purpose computing .",
    "the realization that the evolution of dense stellar systems results not only in interactions among stars , but also among stellar modelers and their programs , has been a major motivating factor in the `` modest '' program ( http://www.manybody.org/modest ) . short for modeling dense stellar systems , modest is a loosely knit collection of groups working on all aspects of the theory and observations of star clusters , including stellar dynamics , stellar evolution , stellar hydrodynamics , and cluster formation .",
    "modest has hosted some 20 meetings over the past 5 years , providing an invaluable forum for discussion and collaboration among researchers in this field .",
    "a key goal of modest is to provide a software framework for large - scale simulations of dense stellar systems , within which existing programs for dynamics , stellar evolution , and hydrodynamics can be easily coupled .",
    "an important aspect of this is the incorporation of `` live '' treatments of stellar and binary evolution and ultimately stellar hydrodynamics directly into kitchen - sink @xmath27-body simulations .",
    "such an undertaking is essential if one wishes to model the evolution of a dense stellar system , in which stellar collisions may be commonplace events , creating wholly new channels for stars to evolve and allowing the formation of stellar species completely inaccessible by standard stellar and binary evolutionary pathways .",
    "a pioneering effort to couple stellar dynamics and stellar evolution was reported by church ( 2006 ) , who combined aarseth s",
    "nbody6 with a version of eggleton s ev ( eggleton 2006 ) .",
    "this heroic accomplishment hard - coded the two programs into a single application , providing proof of concept that two such disparate modules could in fact be successfully merged . the modest approach to code integration , called `` muse , '' for multiscale multiphysics scientific environment ( http://muse.li ) , adopts a rather different approach , providing instead a modular python framework within which programs written by many different authors , and in many different languages , can interoperate with as little intrusion as possible into the internal operation of each ( portegies zwart 2008 ) .",
    "this model has many advantages . by providing well defined interfaces between modules",
    ", it allows researchers ( or students ) to quickly build real scientific applications using state - of - the - art techniques , without first having to become experts in the many details of each module .",
    "equally important , the muse structure allows users to write generic scripts that do not depend on the details of the algorithms used , providing , for the first time , `` plug and play '' functionality that allows different combinations of modules to be combined and compared .",
    "rather than attempting to describe the many astrophysical consequences of collisional stellar dynamics , we turn to a specific problem of particular interest to the relativity community , the possible presence of black holes in these systems .",
    "black holes ( bhs ) are natural products of stellar evolution in massive stars , and may also result from dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments .",
    "they can significantly influence the dynamics of their parent cluster , and may also have important observational consequences , via their x - ray emission , the production of gravitational waves , and their effect on the structural properties of the system in which they reside .",
    "globular clusters offer particularly rich environments for the production of black holes in statistically significant numbers , yet direct evidence for black holes in globulars is scarce , although several independent lines of investigation now hint at their presence . despite the lack of firm observational support , the past three decades have seen many theoretical studies of the formation and dynamics of stellar- and intermediate - mass black holes in star clusters .      given the numerous theoretical studies of the formation and dynamical consequences of bhs in star clusters , and the overwhelming weight of opinion on the inevitability of bhs as consequences of stellar evolution , there is remarkably little observational evidence for stellar - mass ( i.e. less than a few tens of solar masses ) bhs in globular clusters .",
    "there appears to be no evidence for such low - mass bhs in the galactic globular cluster population , and only one firm observation of a stellar - mass bh in an extragalactic globular cluster .",
    "the sole extragalactic bh was reported by maccarone ( 2007 ) , who observed a bright x - ray source in a cluster in ngc 4472 , a bright elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster .",
    "its x - ray luminosity of @xmath33 erg / s is the eddington luminosity for a 35 @xmath34 object , and the source shows substantial variability on a time scale of hours , perhaps indicating a considerably larger mass , so even this candidate may actually fall into the intermediate - mass black hole ( imbh ) range .",
    "interestingly , the parent cluster is itself quite bright ( @xmath35 , or @xmath36 at a distance of 16 mpc ) and lies far ( 30 kpc ) from the center of the host galaxy , perhaps placing this system in the same category as the leading candidates for imbhs in the milky way ( @xmath37 centauri : @xmath38 ; harris 1996 ) and m31 ( g1 : @xmath39 ; meylan 2001 ) , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : observations ] .",
    "although there is considerable theoretical uncertainty about how such objects might form , the observational evidence for imbhs may actually be stronger than that for stellar - mass bhs .",
    "several lines of reasoning support the assertion that imbhs exist in globular clusters : ( 1 ) observations of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , ( 2 ) dynamical modeling , and ( 3 ) studies of cluster structure .",
    "the bright x - ray source m82 x-1 ( matsumoto and tsuru 1999 ; matsumoto 2001 ; kaaret 2001 ) is the strongest ulx candidate for an imbh . with a peak luminosity of more than @xmath40 erg / s ,",
    "it is too bright to be an ordinary x - ray binary , while its location 200 pc from the center of m82 argues against a supermassive black hole .",
    "this luminosity is consistent with an accreting compact object of at least 350 solar masses , possibly an imbh .",
    "the discovery of @xmath41mhz quasi - periodic oscillations ( strohmayer and mushotsky 2003 ) supports this view .",
    "an intriguing aspect of m82 x-1 is its apparent association with the young dense cluster mgg-11 ( mccrady 2003 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : m82 ] ( from portegies zwart 2004 ) shows superimposed near - ir ( hst ) and x - ray ( chandra ) images of the region containing m82 x-1 and mgg-11 . (",
    "the offset between the infrared cluster and the x - ray source is consistent with the absolute pointing accuracies of the two telescopes .",
    ") the cluster age is between 7 and 12 myr .",
    "portegies zwart ( 2004 ) found that such an association would be consistent with the scenario described in  [ sec : formation ] for runaway stellar growth in a dense cluster .",
    "numerous authors have noted that high x - ray luminosity is by no means conclusive evidence of an imbh ( see miller and colbert 2004 for a review of some alternative possibilities ) .",
    "soria ( 2006 , 2007 ) points out that most ulxs may in fact be consistent with the high - luminosity tail of the x - ray binary luminosity function , and that ulxs are generally not associated with young star clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the runaway collision scenario has become the `` standard '' mechanism for imbh formation in clusters , against which others are assessed .    0.2 in      currently",
    "the most definitive statements about imbhs in globular clusters have come from gebhardt and collaborators ( gerssen 2002 , 2003 ; noyola 2006 ; noyola 2008 ) , based on axisymmetric , three - integral dynamical models of cluster potentials , using full line - of - sight velocity information to constrain the model fits .",
    "imbh masses have been reported for the galactic globular clusters m15 and @xmath37 centauri ( fig .  [ fig : cluster ] ) , and for the cluster g1 in m31 , although these results have not been without controversy .",
    "gerssen ( 2002 ) reported dynamical evidence for a @xmath42 imbh in m15 .",
    "this result was criticized by baumgardt ( 2003a ) , who pointed out that a `` standard '' dynamically evolved cluster model would yield similar results , and was marred by a crucially mislabeled figure in an earlier study of m15 s dynamics .",
    "subsequently the estimate of the imbh mass was reduced to @xmath43 ( gerssen 2003 ) .",
    "it now seems clear , from a variety of different arguments , that the core of this highly centrally concentrated cluster does contain on the order of @xmath44 of non - luminous matter ( dull 1997 , baumgardt 2003a , phinney 1993 ) . however , given the age and likely history of m15 , the dark material most plausibly consists of stellar remnants ",
    "neutron stars and/or heavy white dwarfs  providing a much more natural explanation of the invisible mass .",
    "the models do not rule out an imbh at the @xmath45 level , but present no compelling reason to conclude that one exists .",
    "much firmer evidence for imbhs is found in g1 and @xmath37 centauri , the largest globular clusters in m31 and the milky way , respectively .",
    "both clusters are large enough that their relaxation times are long , making it unlikely that the dynamics of stellar evolution products could mimic the effect of a central imbh , as in m15 .    in g1 , a cluster with mass @xmath46 , situated some 40 kpc from the center of m31 ( meylan 2001 ) , the dynamical models yield a black hole mass of @xmath47 ( gebhardt 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "the initial results were also questioned by baumgardt ( 2003b ) , in part because the @xmath48-radius sphere of influence of the supposed imbh lies well inside the central pixel of the hst image , but also because plausible @xmath27-body models without black holes could reproduce the cluster s observed surface density and velocity dispersion profiles quite well .",
    "however , gebhardt ( 2005 ) have argued that the use of the full velocity distribution , and not just its lowest moments , is essential in order to properly define the cluster potential , and that the @xmath27-body simulations simply lack the resolution necessary for them to be meaningfully compared with the observational data .",
    "support for the gebhardt result has come from the recent detection of x - ray emission from g1 ( pooley and rappaport 2006 ) .",
    "the observed luminosity @xmath49 erg / s is consistent with bondi - hoyle accretion of intracluster gas onto an imbh in the relevant mass range .",
    "further support comes from radio observations of g1 ( ulvestad 2007 ) which imply a radio to x - ray flux ratio consistent with a @xmath50 black hole ( merloni 2003 ) .",
    "noyola ( 2006 ) have reported an imbh mass of @xmath51 in @xmath37 centauri , a globular cluster with mass @xmath52 , lying @xmath53 kpc from the center of the milky way .",
    "interestingly , both g1 and @xmath37 centauri lie near the low - mass extension of the `` @xmath54 '' relation for active galactic nuclei ( merritt and ferrarese 2001 ; tremaine 2002 ) , reinforcing the suspicion that g1 and @xmath37 centauri are in fact not `` real '' globular clusters , but rather are the cores of dwarf spheroidal systems stripped by the tidal fields of m31 and the milky way ( meylan 2001 , freeman 1993 ) .",
    "this possibility does not explain the origin of the imbhs , but it obviously moves the question into a very different arena .",
    "noyola and gebhardt ( 2006 ) find that a a surprisingly large fraction ( @xmath5525% ) of globular clusters hitherto thought to have `` classical '' cores in fact have shallow power - law surface brightness profiles in their central regions .",
    "the detection of these weak cusps is due in large part to high - resolution hst observations of the innermost arcsecond of these systems .",
    "these observations remain somewhat controversial , but are in good agreement with theoretical simulations by baumgardt ( 2005 ) of clusters containing central black holes comprising @xmath550.1 - 1% of the total cluster mass , and have been interpreted as indirect indicators of imbhs in these clusters .",
    "ongoing detailed dynamical studies by noyola ( 2008 ) of selected clusters from their earlier study , including ngc 2808 , 47 tucanae , and the `` weak cusp '' systems m54 and m80 should shed much further light on the dynamics of these intriguing systems .",
    "curiously , although dense stellar systems are among the most promising environments for the formation of imbhs ( see  [ sec : formation ] ) , they may not be the best place to look for evidence of massive black holes .",
    "baumgardt ( 2005 ) and heggie ( 2007 ) have pointed out that core - collapse clusters such as m15 are probably the least likely to harbor imbhs .",
    "rather , dynamical heating by even a modest imbh is likely to lead to a cluster containing a fairly extended core . comparing the outward energy flux from stars relaxing inward in the bahcall  wolf ( 1976 ) cusp surrounding the imbh ( of mass @xmath56 ) to the outward flux implied by two - body relaxation at the cluster half - mass radius , heggie estimate the equilibrium ratio of the half - mass ( @xmath57 ) to the core ( @xmath58 ) radius .",
    "calibrating to simulations , they conclude that @xmath59 trenti ( 2008 ) has suggested that the imprint of this process can be seen in his `` isolated and relaxed '' sample of galactic clusters having relaxation times less than 1 gyr , a half - mass to tidal radius ratio @xmath60 , and an orbital ellipticity of less than 0.1 .",
    "roughly half of the clusters in this sample have core radii substantially larger than would be expected on the basis of simple stellar dynamics and binary heating .",
    "however , hurley ( 2007 ) has argued out that such anomalously large core to half - mass ratios may also be explained by the presence of a stellar - mass bh binaries heating the cores of these clusters ( see also mackey 2007 ) .",
    "accepting without further debate the still sketchy observational evidence for imbhs in globular clusters , we now turn to the question of how such black holes might have formed .",
    "the leading possibilities are ( 1 ) they are primordial , the result of stellar evolution in supermassive population iii stars , ( 2 ) they are the result of runaway stellar collisions in young dense star clusters , and ( 3 ) they are the result of mergers of bhs over the lifetime of a cluster .",
    "we focus here on the latter two possibilities , since the formation mechanisms involved are arguably much more relevant to the physics of dense stellar environments .",
    "the likelihood of multiple stellar collisions in dense stellar systems was first demonstrated in @xmath27-body simulations of dense clusters ( portegies zwart 1999 , 2004 ; portegies zwart and mcmillan 2002 ; mcmillan and portegies zwart 2004 ) , and later also in monte - carlo models ( freitag 2006 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations indicate that , when massive stars collide in clusters , they are very likely to merge .",
    "the question then becomes `` what next ? '' unfortunately , while the dynamical processes leading to collision runaways are simple and well known , there are several prominent `` missing links '' in the chain of reasoning starting from a young stellar system and ending with a massive black hole , all involving key aspects of the physics of massive stars .",
    "the dynamics of runaway mergers is straightforward .",
    "massive stars sink to the cluster core on a time scale @xmath61 ( eq .  [ eq : ts ] ) .",
    "the result , for a realistic ( kroupa 2001 ) stellar mass spectrum , is the formation of a dense sub - core of massive stars in a time @xmath62 . here",
    ", @xmath9 can be the half - mass relaxation time for a small system , or the core relaxation time for a larger one , as discussed below .",
    "high densities in the core lead to collisions and mergers , which naturally involve the most massive stars , and the process runs away , with one collision product growing rapidly in mass and radius and outstripping the competition . the resultant merger ( and ,",
    "we assume , black hole ) mass is in the imbh range . for a runaway to occur ,",
    "the collision process must complete before the first supernovae occur , that is , within 35 myr .",
    "this requires short relaxation times , or , equivalently , high cluster densities .    0.2 in    figure [ fig : runaway ] shows a typical set of results , obtained by portegies zwart ( 2004 ) in their @xmath27-body study of the m82 clusters discussed earlier .",
    "the different runs represent a broad range of initial conditions , with and without initial binaries and with both salpeter ( 1955 ) and kroupa ( 2001 ) mass functions , for systems of 128k585k stars .",
    "the runaway masses in nbody4 are generally larger than those in starlab , since nbody4 adopts systematically larger stellar radii and hence collision cross sections , for the most massive stars . comparable results ( in both time scale and in total runaway mass ) have been obtained in monte - carlo simulations ( e.g. freitag 2006 ) .    according to the dynamical models ,",
    "a runaway always occurs if a central core of massive stars ( @xmath63 ) can form by mass segregation before the first supernova occurs . in small systems",
    ", having @xmath64 myr , essentially all the massive stars can reach the center in the time available .",
    "the merger mass fraction , for a typical ( kroupa 2001 ) initial mass function , is @xmath65 ( portegies zwart and mcmillan 2002 ) . in large systems , only a fraction of massive stars can reach the center before exploding as supernovae .",
    "freitag ( 2006 ) report a somewhat smaller mass fraction for the imbh in their monte - carlo models .",
    "mcmillan and portegies zwart ( 2004 ) find that , for @xmath66 , the merger fraction is expected to scale as @xmath67 .",
    "freitag ( 2006 ) find that direct mass loss due to the collision itself is generally unimportant , amounting to less than @xmath68% of the total mass in most cases .",
    "however , the problem of determining the evolution of a possibly rapidly rotating collision product , from its initial non - equilibrium state back to the anomalous main sequence and beyond , presents significant computational challenges ( e.g. sills 2003 ) .",
    "perhaps the greatest uncertainty in the runaway process has to do with mass loss from supermassive stars .",
    "massive main sequence stars are well known to have very strong winds , and these compete with collisions in setting the mass of the final object ( e.g. vanbeveren 2007 ; belkus 2007 ) .",
    "portegies zwart ( 1999 ) recognized that the specifics of the mass loss prescription completely control the outcome of the collision runaway .",
    "applying most of the mass loss late , at the terminal - age main sequence , permits the process to build massive stars , and this prescription has ( unfortunately ) been adopted in most dynamical models to date . a more realistic treatment of mass loss ( based on langer 1994 ) can significantly reduce the mass of the final collision product , while ( probably unrealistic ) early mass loss can shut the process down completely .",
    "by way of calibration , we note that dynamical models typically predict the accretion of @xmath69 of material in @xmath70 yr , for a net accretion rate of @xmath71/yr .",
    "this is comparable to the mass loss rates reported for several massive stars , but substantially less than the largest rates known , e.g. the @xmath72/yr inferred during the decade around the `` great outburst '' of eta carinae in 1843 ( morris 1999 ) .",
    "belkus ( 2007 ) find that massive ( 3001000 @xmath34 ) solar - metallicity stars end their lives as relatively low - mass ( 4050 @xmath34 ) black holes , but comparably massive stars in low - metallicity clusters may give rise to imbhs in the 150200 @xmath34 range .",
    "yungelson ( 2008 ) find a final black hole mass of @xmath73 for a star with initial mass @xmath44 .",
    "these studies suggest that it may be difficult to retain enough mass to form an imbh , although recently , suzuki ( 2007 ) have performed simulations of collisionally merged stars , using a more realistic mass - loss model than in most earlier dynamical studies , and find that , because of the extended envelopes of the merged systems , most collisions are expected to occur early , during the kelvin - helmholtz contraction phase , before mass loss by stellar winds become significant .",
    "they conclude that stellar mass loss does not prevent the formation of massive stars with masses up to @xmath74 .",
    "however , this in turn contrasts sharply with the work of glebbeek ( 2008 ; see also gaburov 2008 , glebbeek 2008 ) , who follows the evolution of a series of collision products drawn from @xmath27-body simulations , computing in detail the return to the main sequence and the subsequent evolution of each merged star .",
    "he concludes that , at least in stars of solar or near - solar metallicity , strong line - driven winds will expel much of the accumulated envelope , resulting in a wolf - rayet star of mass considerably less than 100 @xmath34 by the time a supernova occurs .",
    "obviously , the final word on this important but poorly understood process has yet to be written .",
    "finally , even if mass loss were not a factor , we remind the reader that the assumption that a @xmath44 star will ultimately form a @xmath44 black hole is also largely a matter of conjecture ( see heger 2008 ) .",
    "consider a compact , centrally concentrated young star cluster , with a central density high enough for the runaway collision scenario to operate . for a @xmath75 system ,",
    "the constraint on the relaxation time presented in ",
    "[ sec : runaway ] requires a mean density of @xmath76 , for a half - mass radius of @xmath77 pc .",
    "one might reasonably wonder what such a highly concentrated , dense system has to do with the relatively low - density globular clusters seen today .",
    "can runaway collisional processes shortly after formation account for the imbhs that may exist in the galactic globular cluster system ? based on simulations of many aspects of the problem , we can construct a plausible scenario in which collisionally formed imbhs might now reside in globular clusters .",
    "after the imbh has formed , numerous evolutionary processes combine both to expand the cluster half - mass radius @xmath57 and also to reduce its central concentration , as measured by the ratio @xmath78 ( eq .  [ eq : rcrh ] ) .",
    "if the cluster is not mass segregated at birth , the dynamical effects of segregation by massive stars and their remnants will cause the concentration to decrease significantly , and will also result in a modest overall expansion of the cluster ( merritt 2004 ; mackey 2007 ) . at the same time , mass loss due to stellar evolution drives further overall expansion , by a factor of 23 ( takahashi and portegies zwart 2000 ; mackey 2007 ) .",
    "vesperini ( 2008 ) find that mass loss from the cores of initially mass - segregated clusters is particularly effective in reducing the central concentration .",
    "finally , heating due to the central imbh (  [ sec : indirect ] ) again reduces the concentration and causes significant expansion of @xmath57 over the lifetime of the cluster ; the half - mass radii of the model clusters considered by baumgardt ( 2005 ) expanded by factors of 57 .    taken together ,",
    "these figures suggest that the collision runaway scenario could indeed account for an imbh in a system the size of a typical globular cluster  if one is ever confirmed !",
    "we now briefly consider the opposite extreme , in which the relaxation time is long enough that the massive stars form stellar mass black holes `` in place , '' before significant dynamical evolution can occur .",
    "the evolution of black - hole systems in low - density clusters has been studied by a number of authors .",
    "kulkarni ( 1993 ) and sigurdsson and hernquist ( 1993 ) considered the dynamics of a population of black holes in an idealized star cluster .",
    "they found that mass segregation rapidly transports the black holes to the cluster core , where the black hole subsystem evolves rapidly , forming binaries that ultimately eject most of the black holes from the cluster .",
    "both papers concluded that few observable stellar - mass black holes would be expected in the galactic globular cluster system today .",
    "subsequently , portegies zwart and mcmillan ( 2000 ) performed @xmath27-body simulations , and generally verified these findings , but also concluded that the ejected black - hole binaries could be significant sources of gravitational waves ( gw ) in the ligo band .",
    "these studies were idealized in several important ways .",
    "they were not dynamically self - consistent ( the @xmath27-body simulations combined many small - n simulations to achieve better statistics ) , they did not include a spectrum of black hole masses , and they did not include post - newtonian relativistic effects ( all used the peters and mathews [ 1963 ] formula for gw energy losses ) .",
    "miller and hamilton ( 2002 ) pointed out that a sufficiently massive black hole , at the top end of the stellar black hole mass spectrum , or perhaps the result of a `` failed '' runaway merger , could survive ejection by dynamical interactions , and proposed a mechanism whereby black holes in binary systems would merge by the emission of gw to form successively more massive objects , ultimately resulting in an imbh .",
    "however , it now seems unlikely that this process can operate efficiently in the face of the large gw recoil velocities found in recent numerical simulations of black - hole mergers ( see centrella 2008 for a review ) .",
    "oleary ( 2006 ) carried out monte - carlo simulations of a population of black holes ( roughly 50% binaries ) drawn from a population synthesis calculation starting from realistic distributions of stellar and binary properties .",
    "they included approximate post - newtonian effects in their model , and found that , although modest imbhs ( @xmath79 , up to a maximum of @xmath80 ) did form , in most cases the recoil speed substantially exceeded the escape speed from the cluster , and that the most likely outcome was evaporation of the entire black hole subsystem .",
    "more recent studies , incorporating semi - analytic treatments of gw recoil calibrated to numerical relativity calculations , greatly strengthen this latter result ( amaro - seoane 2008 ) .",
    "the recoil speeds in these simulations are substantially higher than are obtained in the post - newtonian ( up to 3.5pn ) approximation , with the result that virtually none of the bh merger products are expected to remain bound to the cluster .",
    "this finding effectively effectively closing the bh merger avenue for imbh formation and growth , unless an already very massive ( @xmath81 ) seed bh can form by some other means .",
    "although this scenario does not appear to offer a viable channel for imbh production , the many bh binary mergers present potentially rich targets for the enhanced and advanced ligo detectors .",
    "oleary ( 2007 ) infer an advanced ligo detection rate of up to hundreds of events per year , broadly consistent with the range given previously by portegies zwart and mcmillan ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , these estimates are plagued by large uncertainties , due principally to the spread in structural properties of the parent clusters , amplified by the scaling of the gw emission process .",
    "specifically , using the distributions of bh binary energy and eccentricity reported by portegies zwart and mcmillan ( 2000 ) and the peters and matthews ( 1963 ) radiation formula , it is readily shown that the characteristic time scale at which the distribution of gw merger times peaks is proportional to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a typical stellar bh mass and @xmath5 and @xmath84 are , respectively , the mass and radius of the cluster .",
    "the uncertainty is compounded when these numbers are scaled up from individual cluster simulations to integrated populations of clusters across the universe .",
    "nevertheless , the very fact that the current best estimates predict many detections by upcoming ground - based instruments means that , whether or not the predicted events are actually seen , the observations should place strong constraints on the cluster formation history of the universe .",
    "recently , mackey ( 2007 ) have reported a set of fully self - consistent ( newtonian ) dynamical simulations of young dense clusters .",
    "they find that the combination of stellar mass loss and dynamical heating has a significant dynamical impact on the cluster , causing the core ( and , to a lesser extent , the cluster as a whole ) to expand in a manner strikingly similar to the core radius  age relation observed in the young clusters in the lmc ( mackey and gilmore 2003 ) .",
    "however , because of the expansion , the black hole interaction rate drops sharply at late times , and a substantial population of black holes remains after 10 gyr .",
    "if , as seems plausible , this general dynamical result scales to globular - cluster - sized systems , it suggests that the absence of evidence of stellar - mass black holes is not evidence of absence , but simply reflects their low current interaction rate with other cluster members .",
    "there is growing , but arguably still inconclusive , evidence that some globular star clusters may harbor massive black holes in their cores .",
    "perhaps the strongest cases come from dynamical studies of g1 in m31 and @xmath37 centauri in the milky way , but even here the conclusions are tainted to some degree by the suspicion that these massive clusters may actually be the stripped cores of dwarf spheroidal galaxies , in which case they shed little light on the physics of young star clusters or the collisional processes that may give rise to imbhs in stellar systems .",
    "indirect evidence based on cluster structural parameters and central density and velocity profiles is almost as compelling , and follow - up studies of the central velocity structure of `` real '' globular clusters have the potential to revolutionize the debate on this subject .    from a dynamical modeler s perspective , at least , the possibility that collisions in sufficiently dense young clusters might lead to runaway mergers offers the most interesting path to imbhs in globular clusters .",
    "extensive dynamical simulations leave no doubt that stellar collisions occur in sufficiently dense systems , and simple arguments lead to the inevitable conclusion that there is easily enough mass potentially available in these systems to produce objects with masses exceeding @xmath44 . in many ways ,",
    "this process provides a `` natural '' mechanism for imbh formation , but critical aspects of the evolution of the merger product  specifically , the role of stellar winds and the end result of the evolution of very massive stars  remain poorly understood . at present",
    ", it appears that stars with metallicities comparable to that of the sun may be unable to retain enough mass to form an imbh , but that collisions in low - metallicity systems at early times may conceivably have led to runaways in the progenitors of today s globular clusters .",
    "the role of dense stellar systems as potential gravitational wave ( gw ) source factories has been recognized for many years , and dynamical interactions in these systems may produce a wide variety of interesting gw sources .",
    "we confine ourselves here to systems containing imbhs formed by dynamical means , emphasizing again that all of the following estimates should be treated with caution ( if not outright skepticism ) , combining as they do the major uncertainties inherent in both the formation mechanism of the imbhs themselves and the spread in properties of their parent clusters .    * _ bh  imbh inspirals _  intermediate - mass - ratio inspirals ( imris ) involving imbhs formed at the centers of dense star clusters",
    "may be important sources of low - frequency gws for lisa ( barack and cutler 2004 , gair 2004 , will 2004 ; amaro - seoane 2007 ) .",
    "these could plausibly arise through a variety of mechanisms in star clusters , including hardening of an imbh binary , exchange interactions between a bh binary and an imbh , tidal capture of the progenitor star , three - body resonances , or even direct capture via the emission of gw during a close encounter ( see mandel 2007 for a review ) . with the best current estimates for merger rates and signal processing performance , lisa could detect @xmath85 such imbh imris during a three - year run ( miller 2002 , mandel 2007 ) .",
    "advanced ligo may also be able to detect imris of stellar - mass compact objects into low - mass ( @xmath86 ) imbhs in globular clusters , at a rate of @xmath68 events per year ( brown 2007 , mandel 2007 ) .",
    "+  the weakness of the gravitational radiation from a typical bh inspiral into an imbh means that the signal from tens of thousands of orbits must be integrated in order to to detect the source .",
    "therefore , knowledge of the waveform , and especially the probable distribution of orbital eccentricities as determined by simulations , is essential to their detection .",
    "mandel ( 2007 ) conclude that imris in clusters are unlikely to exhibit significant eccentricity by the time they enter the the lisa band .",
    "however , even for low - eccentricity systems , the theoretical imri waveforms are not well known , and this uncertainty may still lead to difficulties in determining the parameters of observed systems . * _ imbh  imbh binaries _",
    "there are also hints that in some circumstances more than one imbh might form in such a cluster ( grkan 2006 ) .",
    "two imbhs in a cluster core are expected to form a binary and merge rapidly by gw emission , in as little as a few million years .",
    "such imbh ",
    "imbh mergers would be powerful and unique probes of the star formation history of the universe .",
    "fregeau ( 2006 ) estimate that lisa could detect tens of imbh  imbh inspirals per year , while advanced ligo might observe 10 merger and ringdown events per year .",
    "however , they find that most such mergers occur at redshift @xmath87 , presumably from relatively high - metallicity progenitors , which may provide the least favorable environment for imbh production ( see  [ sec : evolution ] ) . *",
