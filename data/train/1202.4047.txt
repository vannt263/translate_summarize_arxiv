    "diffusion is one of the most fundamental dynamics in physics . in addition to being ubiquitous",
    ", diffusion also underlies important non - linear systems such as turing reaction - diffusion , schrdinger , fokker - planck , and navier - stokes equations . because these systems typically present symmetric interactions",
    ", few works have addressed the asymmetric counterpart .",
    "however , important networked systems in biology ( e.g. cortical and metabolic networks ) , transportation ( e.g. city traffic ) , and communications ( e.g. www and email networks ) are typically directed and underlain by diffusion  @xcite .",
    "a particularly important property of such systems is how the asymptotic probability of the random walk dynamics ( activation ) can be predicted from intrinsic topological features .",
    "for instance , it is known that the activation is fully correlated with the node degree for undirected networks  @xcite . however ,",
    "this is no longer ensured in the case of diffusion in directed networks @xcite .",
    "the present work reports an investigation on how the balance of directed edges in modular networks defines how activation increases with the inward node degree inside each community , a concept that we call _ efficiency_. in particular , we develop an analytical model , showing that neither the internal degree nor the community topology play a crucial role in defining the efficiency . though general , our findings are illustrated with respect to the macaque cortical network @xcite .",
    "there are many studies concerning diffusion over undirected networks @xcite , but the most recognized property of this dynamics is that its steady - state probability is completely defined by the number of neighbors ( or degree ) @xmath0 of a given node @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "to illustrate this , we consider a random walk taking place on the network .",
    "if the walker is at node @xmath2 at time @xmath3 , we can write the probability of finding this agent at node @xmath1 at time @xmath4 as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 denotes the degree of node @xmath2 , @xmath7 is the total number of nodes , and @xmath8 is the element @xmath9 of the adjacency matrix @xmath10 . after a long period of time , the system is guaranteed to reach equilibrium and we have @xmath11 . in order to find @xmath12",
    "we can use the detailed balance condition @xmath13 @xcite , to obtain @xcite    @xmath14    which we henceforth call the _ activity _ of node @xmath1 .    in the case of directed networks ,",
    "the relation between the activity and the degree of a given node is not linear and remains not completely understood . in this work we focus on the study of some interesting properties that emerge when considering the direction of the edges .",
    "fortunato et al .",
    "@xcite studied the problem of searching in directed networks and found an expression for the pagerank dynamics , which is basically a random walk process with additional random jumps occurring with probability @xmath15 . in the limit @xmath16",
    ", the pagerank reduces to our definition for the activity of a node in a strongly connected network , that is ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the number of connections that point to a node , called inward degree .",
    "an example of directed network where this relation can be studied is the cortical network of the macaque of the family _ cercopithecidae _ @xcite shown in figure [ f : cortical](a ) . in this network",
    ", each node corresponds to a cortical region and the directed edges correspond to corticocortical tracts connecting these regions .",
    "this network has been largely studied in order to understand how stimulus in specific regions of the cortex can induce activation in other regions . concerning the topological organization of this cortical network , we observe the presence of two communities  , which are mostly related to the spatial position ( anterior and posterior ) of the nodes , as seen in figure [ f : cortical](a ) .",
    "the anterior community corresponds to the regions responsible for performing high level tasks such as sensory integration and planning , while the posterior community is related to the primary sensory processing , including the cortical visual area in the occipital , temporal and parietal lobes  @xcite .",
    "we also found an asymmetry of connections between these two communities , with the posterior module receiving more connections from the anterior module than the other way around . in figure",
    "[ f : cortical](b ) we show @xmath19 in terms of @xmath20 for every node of this network , which contradicts the linear dependence between these variables suggested by equation [ eq : p_directed ] . the non - linear behavior shown in figure [ f : cortical](b )",
    "was first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is here verified to be related to the modular organization of the cortical network , identified by the black and white nodes , which correspond to the posterior and anterior communities in figure [ f : cortical](a ) , respectively .    how does the topology of the cortical network originate the observed non - linearity ? in order to address this question , we first need to consider the probability of the walker being at one of the communities .",
    "suppose we have a network of @xmath7 nodes and @xmath21 communities . for simplicity s sake",
    ", we also suppose that all communities have the same size @xmath22 ( the case for different sizes is straightforward ) .",
    "the evolution of the probability @xmath23 of finding the walker at community @xmath24 , is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the probability of the walker going from community @xmath24 to @xmath27 .",
    "in the equilibrium , @xmath28 and the probability of the walker being at each community is given by the eigenvector @xmath29 associated to the unitary eigenvalue of the transition matrix @xmath30 , whose elements are equal to @xmath26 . if we call @xmath31 the variable associated to the number of outward connections that a node inside community @xmath24 has with community @xmath27 , the elements of matrix @xmath30 can be written as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the conditional probability that the walker , being in a node with exactly \\{@xmath34 } connections , will move from community @xmath24 to @xmath27 .",
    "this probability can be expressed as    @xmath35    .",
    "( b ) relationship between the activity and inward degree of each node",
    ". nodes in ( b ) are colored according to the community they belong in ( a ) . ]    where @xmath36 corresponds to the number of outward connections of nodes inside community @xmath24 .",
    "regarding poissonian networks ( e.g. erds - rnyi random graph ) , equation [ eq : pij ] can be exactly solved , but since the node degrees of these networks are known to be well represented by the mean value of the associated degree distribution , it is reasonable to make the homogeneous assumption and consider every node as having the same number of connections pointing to each community .",
    "therefore , every node @xmath1 inside the community @xmath24 makes @xmath37 connections with the community @xmath27 . under this assumption ,",
    "the probability @xmath26 is related to the mixing parameter @xcite , and can be written as    @xmath38    finally , we can write the activity of a node @xmath1 located inside community @xmath24 as    @xmath39    where , @xmath40 . equation [ eq : activity_n ] corresponds to the asymptotic probability of the walker being inside community @xmath24 , @xmath41 , times the activity of a node in a directed network , given by equation [ eq : p_directed ] evaluated over the nodes inside community @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath42 is here called efficiency of the community @xmath24 , since it represents the capacity of the community @xmath24 to generate activity through the inward connections of its nodes .    in order to test the accuracy of equation [ eq : activity_n ]",
    ", we propose a model for modular directed network where it is possible to control the efficiency of each community .",
    "first , we define the @xmath43 matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 , that specify the desired internal ( diagonal entries ) and external ( off diagonal entries ) degrees and reciprocities , respectively .",
    "the elements of these matrices are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 corresponds to the average reciprocity @xcite of the connections between community @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "next , we create @xmath21 undirected erds - rnyi networks with @xmath48 edges and assign a random direction for every edge @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , a reciprocal edge @xmath49 is added to the network with a probability @xmath50 , which defines the reciprocity of network @xmath24 .",
    "the final average internal degree of this network is then @xmath51 .",
    "finally , the same procedure is applied to connect the created networks between themselves , but now considering the off - diagonal elements of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in figure [ f:3_com](a )",
    "we show the communities efficiency for the case @xmath52 and @xmath53 as a function of the average number of connections between communities 1 and 2 , @xmath54 . for each point in this figure",
    ", we created several networks using the proposed model . through linear regression",
    ", we estimated the angular coefficient of the relation between activity and inward degree , which corresponds to the points of the figure .",
    "the dashed lines represent the value of @xmath42 expected by equation [ eq : activity_n ] for each community .",
    "it is clear that the homogeneous assumption works well and can correctly predict the communities efficiency .    .",
    "the respective parameters are shown above each graph . ]",
    "the most striking feature of equation [ eq : activity_n ] is that each community can have different efficiency .",
    "it is possible to show that if the communities are balanced , which is the case for all undirected networks , the internal degree can not change the relative efficiency between communities . in order to show that",
    ", let us consider the case where all the communities are balanced and , consequently , @xmath55 for all @xmath56 , implying @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 is an eigenvector of the transition matrix @xmath59 , and    @xmath60    which does not depend on the community and recovers the previous result given in equation [ eq : p_directed ] .",
    "this result means that denser communities have greater activity , but the relation between activity and inward degree remains the same for every community . if we try to increase the activity of community @xmath24 by adding edges inside it , both its average inward degree @xmath61 and probability @xmath41 will increase in the same proportion , making the efficiency nearly constant according to equation  [ eq : activity_n ] .",
    "the only change comes from the increase in average inward degree @xmath62 of the network , which in general cases is hardly affected by the change of only one community .",
    "we observed that such a behavior is also verified when the communities are unbalanced , as shown in figure [ f:3_com](b ) , or for networks with different reciprocities , as shown in figure [ f:3_com](c ) .",
    "to better understand the effect of unbalancing the connections between communities , we start with @xmath21 balanced communities , and invert a fraction @xmath63 of the outgoing connections between the community @xmath64 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is repeated for every community @xmath24 , so as to greatly increase the activity of @xmath64 .",
    "we need to show that under reasonable conditions the efficiency of @xmath64 after the rewiring process ( @xmath65 ) is higher than the rest of the network , i.e. @xmath66 for a given @xmath24 . in order to do",
    "so we first observe that the new transition probabilities , @xmath67 , are given by    @xmath68    where @xmath69 if @xmath70 and 0 otherwise .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath71 , the ratio @xmath72 for @xmath73 , between the elements of the eigenvector @xmath74 of the new transition matrix , must diverge . on the other hand , assuming that @xmath75 denotes the number of inward connections of nodes inside community @xmath24 after the inversion process , the inward degree ratio , given by    @xmath76    will remain bounded , making the efficiency ratio between communities @xmath64 and @xmath24 being necessarily higher than one .    in the case of communities with scale - free topology @xcite ,",
    "it is harder to find a closed expression for the activity , but there is nothing indicating that the same effect can not be observed .",
    "there is also no standard model to generate a modular network with scale - free topology in which the balance of connections between the communities can be systematically controlled .",
    "nevertheless , we can imagine a very simple model where @xmath21 barabsi - albert networks @xcite are created and randomly connected in the same manner as in our previously presented model .",
    "this is not a truly scale - free network , but it can be shown that @xmath26 is given as     in a modular network whose communities have scale - free topology .",
    "all communities have @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "dashed lines correspond to the analytical prediction . ]",
    "@xmath82    where @xmath83 is a normalization factor .",
    "this expression should work well if the external degree of the nodes is smaller than the minimum degree of the ba networks .",
    "in figure [ f:3_com_ba ] we see that this is exactly what happens , in the sense that , equation [ eq : prob_ba ] and the simulated results are in a good agreement for small values of @xmath84 , but deviates as @xmath84 increases .",
    "we also see in figure [ f:3_com_ba ] the same variation in efficiency caused by the balance between communities , which confirms that such behavior is topology independent .",
    "therefore , we obtained a reasonable model to explain the non - linearity observed in the relation between activity and inward degree in the cortical network .",
    "we found all the relevant parameters of each community previously detected in the cortical network , which were considered to perform a single realization of our model with poissonian distribution .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ f : exp_cortical ] , where we can see that the model originates a two - group activity that is very similar to that found for the cortical network .",
    "in addition , since the network has only two communities , we can write equation [ eq : activity_n ] in a closed form for community 1 as    @xmath85    where    @xmath86    with a similar expression holding for the second community .",
    "the predicted values of activity using equation [ eq : activity_2 ] are shown in figure [ f : exp_cortical ] , where we see a good agreement between the analytical and original activity of the given cortical network .",
    "the small difference likely comes from the nontrivial degree distribution and correlations in the real network which were not taken into account in our model .    , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the mean reciprocities are @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the communities have 42 and 43 nodes . ]",
    "the loss of correlation in directed networks has been an intriguing phenomenon .",
    "we have shown in this article that it is intrinsically associated to the unbalance of directed connections between communities in a network .",
    "we also found that the communities topology and edges reciprocity do not significantly affect their respective efficiency .",
    "the derived equations provide the basis not only for better understanding the effect of modular structure in diffusion dynamics , but also for planning strategies for increasing or decreasing the number of accesses to nodes in real - world networks .",
    "for example , in the context of the www , if we want to increase the activity inside a given module , it may be more efficient to add connections coming from other modules than to increase the density of connections inside the module .",
    "the implications are particularly relevant for neuroscience , where the systems are almost invariantly modular and directed",
    ". it would also be interesting to study the efficiency along topological scales , as well as to extend the results reported in this work to other types of dynamics such as integrate and fire and synchronization .",
