    "the nature of the interaction between an accreting super - massive black hole ( smbh ) and its host galaxy remains a challenging problem in the study of galaxy evolution .",

    "this gas typically forms a dusty structure at small radii with a characteristic length scale of @xmath41 - 10 parsecs which in some cases has been imaged directly @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , this structure can be modelled as a torus @xcite , but there is an ongoing theoretical effort to provide a detailed , self - consistent explanation of its configuration and what supports it .",
    "if a sufficiently strong poloidal magnetic field is present at the parsec scale , one possible explanation is that the dusty gas is launched as a hydromagnetic wind @xcite .",
    "heating of the ism from stellar feedback might support the dusty gas in a puffy disk @xcite .",
    "the disk might be simultaneously supported by infrared radiation pressure @xcite , or the infrared radiation pressure may generate a failed wind @xcite .",
    "regardless of what supports the torus , gas continues to be drawn in to the black hole accretion disk at small radii ( @xmath5 cm ) , where it powers an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the radiation emitted from smbh accretion disks influences the dynamics of the torus itself , along with the dynamics of the host galaxy .",
    "this feedback may act through a number of channels that include radiative heating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , jets @xcite , and winds driven by radiation pressure on resonant ultraviolet lines @xcite and dust @xcite .",
    "our challenge is to understand the combined effect of all these modes of interaction .",
    "improving our understanding of this connection will be crucial for answering questions about the growth of smbhs , observations of agn , and the star formation histories in galaxies .",
    "recent observations have begun to reveal the violent impact that agn may have on their host galaxies .",
    "observations of obscured quasars such as sdss j1356 + 1026 have revealed outflows extending out to tens of kiloparsecs from the galactic nucleus @xcite .",
    "the estimated mechanical luminosity of these outflows ( @xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 ) is too large to be explained by the inferred star formation activity .",
    "other obscured quasars possess more massive outflows , with mass - loss rates of hundreds of solar masses per year @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , observations of local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) have led to the discovery of outflows with velocities that are correlated with the agn bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "these outflows also have mass - loss rates equal to several times the star formation rate and in some cases exceeding 1000 solar masses per year , depleting the gas on timescales as short as @xmath8 years . adding to our picture are studies of post - starburst galaxies , exhibiting outflows with median velocity of approximately 1000 km s@xmath7 , suggesting that past agn activity played a role in launching the gas @xcite .",
    "these observations are complemented by numerical simulations of agn feedback @xcite that account for deposition of both energy and momentum from the accretion radiation , including a combination of heating by x - rays and photoionizations , radiation pressure at the kiloparsec scale , and winds driven from within a radius of less than 100 parsecs . taken together , these effects can help to explain both the @xmath9 - @xmath10 relation @xcite and the existence of galactic outflows observed at speeds of thousands of km s@xmath7 .",
    "the results , particularly those of @xcite , also suggest that line - driven winds may be insufficient to drive observed outflows , and that a large amount of momentum ( @xmath11 ) may need to be deposited via absorption by dust grains during the period when the smbh is optically thick to both ultraviolet and far - infrared radiation , the time when most black hole growth is believed to occur @xcite .",
    "a large uncertainty in the numerical calculations referenced above is the amount of radiative momentum deposited within the central unresolved radius .",
    "the velocity and mass - loss rate of the resulting wind depend sensitively on this coupling .",
    "moreover , in those studies the momentum was deposited in a spherically symmetric manner . in reality ,",
    "multidimensional effects , such as the tendency for radiation to escape out the rarefied , polar regions of the gas distribution , will be crucial .",
    "these effects have been considered by several previous studies . @xcite",
    "computed the radiation forces exerted on a torus modelled as a constant density cylindrical shell , and @xcite extended that work to account for a more self - consistent rearrangement of the gas under the influence of the radiation .",
    "a radiation - hydrodynamics study that linked the effects of compton scattering and broad absorption line winds at the parsec scale with inflow processes on galactic ( kiloparsec ) scales in two spatial dimensions was undertaken by @xcite , and this was extended in order to capture the radiative transfer through dusty gas in @xcite .",
    "our study extends this work further by performing three dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer calculations for dusty gas , including both smooth and clumpy gas distributions , and by integrating the force on columns of gas in order to quantify the mass outflow rate from agn radiating at high luminosity .",
    "the momentum flux in radiation from a smbh accretion disk with luminosity @xmath12 is @xmath1 .",
    "generally @xmath12 will not exceed @xmath13 , the eddington luminosity set by the electron scattering ( thomson ) opacity .",
    "dust will contribute to the opacity seen by the radiation at large radii , but only at distances greater than the radius @xmath14 at which its temperature drops below the sublimation temperature @xmath15 .",
    "although the sublimation temperature varies for each grain depending on its composition and its size , we choose to adopt the simplification of assigning a uniform sublimation temperature to all the dust in our calculations .",
    "the sublimation radius may be estimated as    @xmath16    when the gas distribution surrounding the smbh is not isotropic , @xmath14 may vary with angle . within this radius ,",
    "electron scattering dominates the opacity , and the usual eddington limit applies .    once the intrinsic photons from the accretion disk encounter dust in the surrounding gas , they are absorbed and the energy is re - emitted at infrared wavelengths .",
    "if the gas is also optically thick to the infrared , then the re - emitted radiation will continue to be absorbed and re - emitted in a random - walk pattern until it exits the optically thick region . along the way , momentum will be imparted by the photons to the gas multiple times . in this scenario it is possible for the radiation to transfer momentum to the gas at a rate that exceeds @xmath17 . for a spherically symmetric problem , this `` boost '' factor to the infrared radiation force is exactly the infrared optical depth of the gas , which can be shown as follows : in steady - state , when radiative equilibrium holds and the luminosity as a function of radius is constant , we may compute the radiation force per volume @xmath18 as @xmath19    the total outward force exerted by the radiation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the radial optical depth for the infrared photons .    in a gas rich galactic nucleus with a column density of @xmath22 @xmath23 , a mean mass per particle of 1.5 times the proton mass , and an infrared dust opacity of 10 @xmath24 per gram of gas , an initial guess for",
    "the optical depth would be approximately 250 .",
    "there are two primary effects that will reduce the actual radiation force from such a high value .",
    "the first is the lack of spherical symmetry : a torus obscures only a fraction of the solid angle surrounding the accretion disk , and the presence of clumps and voids in the torus can increase the photon mean free path for certain sightlines .",
    "the second effect is dust sublimation : dust will be absent from the innermost regions of the nucleus that contribute a substantial fraction to the gas column density , and the force integral can be well - approximated by setting its lower limit to @xmath14 .    to get a sense of the sort of momentum deposition rates that have been observed ,",
    "consider the case of mrk 231 .",
    "this system features an outflow of neutral gas with velocities in the range 360 - 900 km s@xmath7 and a mass - loss rate estimated at 420 solar masses per year @xcite .",
    "the momentum flux in the outflow , estimated by multiplying the mass loss rate by the velocity , is between 2.6 to 6.5 times @xmath1 where @xmath12 is measured to be @xmath25 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the outflow , on the other hand , is estimated at @xmath26 ergs s@xmath7 , less than 1% of the bolometric agn luminosity .",
    "modeling the force from radiation pressure , and predicting by what factor it exceeds @xmath1 , becomes a difficult problem to tackle analytically in the absence of spherical symmetry , the presence of clumps , and with an accounting for dust sublimation . for these reasons",
    ", we turn here to three - dimensional radiative transfer calculations using the wavelength - dependent monte carlo radiative transfer code sedona @xcite . given that the radiative diffusion time in these systems is shorter than the dynamical times , we restrict ourselves to steady - state configurations that do not include an explicit coupling to hydrodynamics .    in section [ methodologysection ] ,",
    "we describe how we parametrize the gas configurations surrounding the black hole and how we treat the key physical processes in the radiative transfer . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present our results for a series of calculations in which we vary the opening angle of the torus , the amount of gas present , and the accretion disk luminosity .",
    "we also examine how our dynamical conclusions are affected by accounting for a clumpy rather than smooth distribution of dust and gas .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "although the specific region we are studying is difficult to observe directly , gravito - hydrodynamic simulations @xcite provide information about its configuration before the effects of radiative feedback are felt .",
    "the gas and stars form a thick disk roughly in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium ( our usage of the word `` disk '' throughout the remainder of this study refers to what is usually labelled as the torus and should not be confused with a reference to the black hole accretion disk , which is unresolved at our scales of interest ) .",
    "the puffiness of the disk in the @xcite simulations is to some extent determined by the sub - grids turbulent velocity dispersion when strong stellar feedback in the ism is included , but also by bending modes ( firehose instabilities ) driven by resolved velocities when less stellar feedback is included .",
    "while further accretion of the gas at this scale will rely on non - axisymmetric torques , we first adopt a simple axisymmetric , hydrostatic disk model analogous to one used in @xcite .",
    "this parametrization captures the key features of the gas configuration seen in the hydrodynamics simulations , but allows us greater control over free parameters and removes unnecessary complications in our attempt to isolate the effects of the radiation .",
    "such a parametrization also allows us to systematically introduce clumpiness into the gas for certain calculations ( which , among other effects , breaks axisymmetry ) , as will be described in section [ clumpysetup ]    the vertical structure of the smooth disk model may be calculated by solving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium in the normal ( @xmath27 ) direction , assuming an isothermal equation of state with effective sound speed @xmath28 set by both the resolved and sub - grid velocity dispersion , along with any contribution from the thermal pressure of the gas , @xmath29 with solution @xmath30 \\right\\ } \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath31 denotes the gravitational potential , @xmath32 denotes the density of the gas , and @xmath33 is the cylindrical radius .",

    "this is also in agreement with the simulations presented in @xcite in which @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the results for varying @xmath42 correlate strongly with the corresponding change in torus mass within the computational domain , and so we choose to capture variations in torus mass and column density by varying the normalization of the radial density profile ( the parameter @xmath44 described below ) , while fixing @xmath42 to @xmath45 for all calculations presented in this paper .    converting to spherical polar coordinates @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath47 is taken to be zero along the z - axis , we obtain @xmath48 \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath49 represents some inner cut - off radius where the density is @xmath44 , and to prevent the radial column density from diverging we take @xmath50 .",

    "the wide - angle bipolarity of these outflows corresponds well to observations of obscured quasars @xcite and seyfert 2s @xcite .",
    "although the radiative acceleration is greatest in the polar regions , the majority of the ejected mass comes from oblique angles where there is a more significant reservoir of gas .",
    "by contrast , gas in the equatorial plane is more difficult to unbind because of its large inertia and large integrated gravitational attraction .",
    "the net momentum flux in the resulting outflow can exceed @xmath0 by factors of up to 5 for the parameters studied , as infrared photons interact multiple times during their outward diffusion . as recently demonstrated in the calculations of @xcite , outflows with these properties have a significant impact on gas in the surrounding host galaxy .",
    "our results for the outflows match reasonably well the observed outflows in local ulirgs such as mrk 231 @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rates and kinetic luminosity fractions we calculate also provide a reasonable match to observations of obscured quasars @xcite , although our model does not provide a mechanism for launching large amounts of gas at the high velocities ( @xmath204 km s@xmath7 ) observed in these systems at small radii .",
    "one possibility is that these quasars are exhibiting both line and continuum radiation pressure driven outflows .",
    "we find that the net effect of the agn radiation on the surrounding gas is a strong function of the opening angle of the accreting gas at the parsec - scale ( the torus ) .",
    "increasing the opening angle allows more momentum to be deposited in all directions because the mass distribution and emergent radiative flux become more isotropic .",
    "we also find a steep dependence of the outflow rate on the luminosity of the accretion disk , because at higher luminosities gas becomes unbound over a greater range of solid angles .",
    "this result is also in agreement with the observed anti - correlation between obscured agn fraction and agn luminosity @xcite , although we are restricting our attention to a single black hole mass .    keeping all of our parameters at the fiducial values listed in table [ fiducialparameters ] but varying the luminosity",
    ", we find that outward radiative acceleration begins to exceed gravity at all angles once @xmath205 reaches a value of @xmath206 .",
    "this value is subject to uncertainty given our approximate treatment of the gas dynamics , but it may nevertheless help to aid understanding of the relative dearth of broad - line quasars observed to be radiating at their full eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "the effects of dust sublimation play a crucial rule in determining the angular dependence of the radiative force on the torus .",
    "the redistribution of flux between polar angles takes place almost entirely in the region of gas in which dust has been sublimated , where infrared radiation is re - emitted from the edge of the dusty gas at angles deviating from the radial direction . once photons penetrate into the dusty gas , they tend to diffuse radially and deposit momentum almost entirely in the radial direction .    all of the results presented above must be considered in light of the approximations and assumptions that we have used . in particular , while allowing for a range of torus scale heights and masses , we have focused on an initial distribution of gas close to hydrostatic equilibrium , without accounting for the self - consistent dynamical rearrangement of the torus as the outflow takes place , perhaps accompanied by inflow when possible .",
    "we have also discounted centrifugal support of the torus , which may lead to an underestimate of the mass loss rate when the integrated radiation force is close to that of gravity .",
    "another effect we do not capture in these calculations is the potential for the outflowing gas to develop radiative rayleigh - taylor instabilities , which might provide more avenues of photon leakage and reduce the coupling of the radiative momentum to the gas as studied by @xcite . concerning this last point",
    ", our clumpy gas simulations can provide a preliminary estimate of the extent to which the radiation force would be reduced in the presence of such instabilities . also , due to the high opacity encountered by the direct ultraviolet radiation from the accretion disk , the direct radiation field plays a much more important role in launching the gas in our calculation than in @xcite . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "the radiative rayleigh - taylor instability can be suppressed when the direct radiation field is sufficiently strong .",
    "a fully coupled radiation - hydrodynamic calculation will be needed to fully understand the subsequent behavior of the gas in time .",
    "future work will focus on incorporating the results of this study into hydrodynamic simulations of black hole accretion .",
    "in addition to the coupling to the hydrodynamics , more details pertinent to the radiative physics may be addressed in such calculations , including line absorption , anisotropic scattering off of dust , metallicity gradients , and variations in the average dust - to - gas ratio .",

    "<S> observational and theoretical arguments suggest that the momentum carried in mass outflows from agn can reach several times @xmath0 , corresponding to outflow rates of hundreds of solar masses per year . radiation pressure on resonant absorption lines alone may not be sufficient to provide this momentum deposition , and the transfer of reprocessed ir radiation in dusty nuclear gas has been postulated to provide the extra enhancement . the efficacy of this mechanism , however , will be sensitive to multi - dimensional effects such as the tendency for the reprocessed radiation to preferentially escape along sightlines of lower column density . </S>",
    "<S> we use monte carlo radiative transfer calculations to determine the radiation force on dusty gas residing within approximately 30 parsecs from an accreting super - massive black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the net rate of momentum deposition in the surrounding gas and estimate the mass - loss rate in the resulting outflow as a function of solid angle for different black hole luminosities , sightline - averaged column densities , clumping parameters , and opening angles of the dusty gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these dust - driven winds carry momentum fluxes of 1 - 5 times @xmath1 and correspond to mass - loss rates of 10 - 100 @xmath2 per year for a @xmath3 @xmath2 black hole radiating at or near its eddington limit . </S>",
