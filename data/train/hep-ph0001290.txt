    "the @xmath3 factories at slac and kek are now collecting data and expect to produce measurements of the @xmath1 asymmetry in the mode @xmath5 within one year , measuring @xmath6 .",
    "preliminary results on this mode from cdf @xcite already indicate that it is unlikely that a discrepancy with the standard model will be found from this result alone .",
    "this means that tests of the standard model mechanism for @xmath1 violation will rely upon our ability to measure further @xmath1-violating parameters , such as the angle @xmath7 of the unitarity triangle , with sufficient accuracy to be sensitive to standard model relationships .",
    "this will require that we master the removal of theoretical uncertainties due to penguin diagrams in at least one of the available channels .",
    "so far there are two sets of candidate decay modes , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite , for which analyses to extract @xmath2 using isospin relationships have been suggested .",
    "the first suffers from relatively small branching ratios@xcite and from the experimental difficulty of measuring the @xmath10 branching ratio .",
    "some of the modes for the second case have recently been observed at cleo @xcite .",
    "these results are encouraging .",
    "they are close to model - dependent predictions and , hence , appear to reinforce estimates that the analysis suggested by snyder and quinn will require of order 180 fb@xmath11 , or six years of running at babar design luminosity , to complete @xcite .",
    "this paper revisits that analysis and reviews what intermediate steps can be made with earlier data samples . in particular",
    "we stress that many of the parameters relevant to the extraction of @xmath2 can be predetermined from untagged , and from tagged but time - integrated data samples .",
    "the benefit of this is that , once this is done , only the @xmath1-violating parameter @xmath2 remains to be fit to the full tagged and time - dependent dalitz plot .",
    "presumably it will then be possible to perform the @xmath12 analysis with smaller data samples than those needed if the full set of ten parameters is fit to the tagged , time - dependent sample alone ( as has been done to date in monte carlo studies of this mode ) .",
    "we also discuss bounds on the shift in @xmath2 from penguin contributions .",
    "these can be obtained , by methods similar to those previously suggested for the @xmath13 modes @xcite , even if the @xmath14 amplitude is too small to be measured directly .",
    "we will also discuss a bound which applies only in the @xmath12 case , having no parallel in the @xmath8 case .",
    "this paper presents a purely theoretical discussion , with no simulations and no attempt to address issues of backgrounds or of other modes that may contribute to the @xmath15 dalitz plot @xcite .",
    "certainly these issues will be important .",
    "the larger untagged data sample will also be the first place to explore the issues of further contributions to the dalitz plot .",
    "the approach of fixing as many parameters as possible from the untagged and from the tagged but time - integrated data samples , combined with improvements in machine luminosity , such as those already under study for pepii , may make the extraction of a reliable value for @xmath2 a reality on a somewhat faster time scale than suggested by the estimates based on fits to tagged data only .",
    "we are interested in the decays from @xmath16 and @xmath17 into @xmath12 final states .",
    "the decay amplitudes can be classified according to isospin : @xmath18 form an isospin doublet ; the final state @xmath12 can have isospin @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 components . in general",
    ", the final state with @xmath19 can only be reached with operators having @xmath22 ; the final state with @xmath20 can be reached with operators having @xmath22 or @xmath23 ; and the final state with @xmath21 can be reached with operators having @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",

    "therefore , the isospin amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 only receive contributions ( and , thus , weak phases ) from the tree - level diagrams .",

    "this argument is not theoretically rigorous because @xmath46 may be fed from other topologies through strong final state rescattering .",
    "eventually experiment will tell us whether these effects are important .",
    "in what follows we will neglect two contributions which are suppressed in the sm .",
    "the first contribution arises from the electroweak penguin diagrams , which have the same weak phase structure as the qcd penguin diagrams , but contribute to both @xmath22 and @xmath23 amplitudes . as a result ,",
    "the electroweak penguin contributions are not removed by the isospin - based analyses . however , they are expected to be very small in these channels @xcite .",

    "[ eq : ckm ] the first of these expressions is the weak phase of the tree - level contributions .",

    "( [ eq : ckm ] ) . in what follows we always subsume this second term within the amplitudes we refer to as @xmath44 tree amplitudes .",

    "this has two consequences .",
    "firstly , this bound , which is extremely powerful , has no analogue for the @xmath176 decays . secondly ,",
    "since the bound depends on the interference effects , it may be sensitive to the assumptions mentioned above about the exact shape of the @xmath4-resonances .",
    "this analysis has taken a purely formal approach and has not evaluated all the relevant experimental questions . the quantities which we call `` mathematically redundant '' are actually additional data samples that contribute to fixing the parameters .",
    "the parameters we define are all intrinsic to the physical process and hence are , like branching fractions , expected to be the same in any experiment .",
    "one issue that will be important experimentally is that the errors on the various parameters are highly correlated and must be treated correctly in establishing bounds such as those from eq .",
    "( [ helenbound ] ) and the allowed range for @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , backgrounds , efficiencies , and cuts will differ in the different data samples and must be investigated separately in each case .",
    "a good knowledge of the variations in efficiencies across the dalitz plot is also essential for this analysis .",
    "the extraction of the parameter @xmath78 is sensitive to the knowledge of overall efficiencies ; it may be better to simply define a @xmath187 measured separately for each data sample than to depend on the accuracy with which the overall efficiency and luminosity for each data sample is known .",
    "other caveats have been mentioned , such as the need to explore the sensitivity of the results to reasonable changes in the assumed @xmath4-shape parameterization , and the recognition of the possible large backgrounds in the untagged sample .",
    "all of these issues and many more will only be settled by examining the data .",
    "none of them appear to us to invalidate the expectation that it will be very valuable , at least in the early years of study of these modes , to use the parameters determined from the time - integrated experiments when studying the @xmath1 violating effects in the time - dependent data .",
    "the @xmath158 decays are described by ten parameters , _ c.f . _",
    "( [ master ] ) and ( [ masterbar ] ) .",
    "we have shown that untagged data can be used to extract eight of these ten parameters and tagged time - integrated data allows evaluation of one further parameter .",
    "this leaves only the one @xmath1-violating parameter @xmath2 ( @xmath54 if new physics contributes an extra phase @xmath51 to the mixing ) to be determined from time - dependent data .",
    "the parameters in question are defined in an experiment - independent fashion and hence the values measured in a time - integrating experiment , such as can be pursued at cleo , can be used as input to fits of the time - dependent data sample  thereby possibly allowing a measurement of the parameter @xmath54 earlier than could be achieved without this input .",
    "we have also shown that , if the neutral @xmath4 contributions are small , then , prior to the time when the statistics are sufficient to provide a measurement of these effects , bounds on their contribution will allow bounds on the shift of the angle measured from the rates and interference of the two charged @xmath4 channels from the true value @xmath2 .",

    "these decays involve the new complex parameter _ 1 = - .",
    "therefore , the information in @xmath191 decays by itself does not help in constraining the parameters involved in the decays of the neutral @xmath3 s into three pions ; these two rates merely allow a determination of the magnitude and phase of @xmath193 .",
