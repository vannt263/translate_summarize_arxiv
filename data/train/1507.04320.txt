    "in 1950 , seifert asked whether every nonsingular flow on the 3-sphere has a closed orbit @xcite .",

    "schweitzer s examples were generalized considerably and it is known that the flows can be taken to be smooth @xcite or volume - preserving @xcite .",

    "two flowlines lying in a single stable leaf are forwards asymptotic , and the points where these flowlines intersect a strong stable leaf are asymptotic on the nose .",

    "this is an anosov flow whose weak stable and unstable foliations are simply the suspensions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    more generally , a flow is _ pseudo - anosov _ if it is anosov everywhere except near some isolated closed orbits , where it is modeled on the suspension of a pseudo - anosov diffeomorphism .",
    "pseudo - anosov flows have _ singular _ weak stable and unstable foliations , which look like figure  [ figure:2dfoliations ] near the singularities .        the anosov closing lemma leverages the transverse contracting - expanding behavior of a pseudo - anosov flow to find closed orbits .",
    "an _ almost - cycle _ is a long flow segment whose endpoints are close together .",
