    "the digital economy is increasingly self - organizing into a `` platform society '' @xcite where individuals exchange knowledge , goods , and resources on a peer - to - peer ( p2p ) basis . in recent years",
    "we have indeed witnessed how a number of well - established business - to - consumer sectors , such as the taxi and hotel industries @xcite , have been disrupted by the emergence of the novel sharing economy p2p marketplaces .",
    "p2p platforms rely on trust between their users .",
    "trust is typically established by developing a reputation through digital peer - review mechanisms that allow users to rate their peers @xcite .",
    "given the expected growth of the p2p paradigm , digital reputation will increasingly become central in our online lives , as it will determine access to substantial economic opportunities .",
    "hence , it is crucial to ensure that digital peer - review systems produce reliable reputation scores .",
    "being decentralised , p2p systems are often thought to promote more economic freedom and democratisation . yet , their current lack of regulation exposes them to a number of biases which can distort their functioning @xcite .",
    "game theoretic considerations @xcite , and plenty of anecdotal evidence , suggest that users are often incentivised to reciprocate both positive and negative ratings .    in this paper",
    "we show that p2p systems are indeed statistically characterized by excessive reciprocity , and that , on average , one reciprocated rating contributes to a user s reputation more than an unreciprocated one .",
    "the fact that reciprocity strongly affects reputation is rather relevant . indeed , although it is true that the formation of social ties tends to be driven by homophily @xcite , which in turn might lead similar individuals to reciprocate more than they would do otherwise , it is also well documented that p2p platform users also exchange positive ratings to mutually boost reputation .",
    "the `` @xmath0 for @xmath0 '' practice of uber drivers and passengers , i.e. agreeing on exchanging @xmath0 star ratings at the beginning of a ride , is a common firsthand experience of such a practice @xcite , and similar phenomena have been reported in the interactions between ebay buyers and sellers @xcite and airbnb hosts and guests @xcite .",
    "symmetrically , negative reciprocity due to mutually honest negative feedback needs to be distinguished from the retaliatory exchange of negative ratings .",
    "therefore , our results show that a central issue in the design of p2p rating systems is that of discerning the information content of reciprocated ratings",
    ".    reputation in online marketplaces is known to affect a buyer s willingness to pay @xcite . in this respect",
    ", the exchange of ratings effectively introduces _ externalities _ in p2p platforms @xcite , as they prevent users from making informed _ ex ante _ decisions about their peers .",
    "moreover , the anticipation of retaliatory behaviour can discourage users from providing negative feedback @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is well known that online ratings are often skewed towards positive values @xcite . in summary",
    ", an excess of reciprocity may deteriorate the overall information content in p2p platforms and pose a threat to their fairness and transparency .",
    "we quantify the excess of reciprocity in p2p rating systems with respect to a range of null hypotheses , and to measure the impact it has in shaping online reputation .",
    "we do so by taking a deliberately reductionist approach .",
    "namely , we investigate three case studies of p2p platforms with binary interactions , i.e. platforms whose users can either choose to endorse or reject their peers activity .",
    "these environments represent a stylised template of the feedback systems underpinning p2p platforms , and allow for a parsimonious representation in terms of signed networks : a positive ( negative ) interaction between two platform users can be represented as a link carrying a positive ( negative ) sign between two nodes in a graph .",
    "such systems have attracted considerable attention in the network literature @xcite , as they offer a natural laboratory to test theories for systems with antagonistic interactions , such as social balance theory @xcite and consensus formation @xcite .",
    "this network representation is particularly useful to quantify the statistical significance of reciprocity and its impact on user reputation .",
    "indeed , the properties of multi - agent interacting systems can often be encoded into well defined _",
    "network motifs_. this , in turn , allows to quantify the statistical significance of empirically observed features by verifying whether certain motifs are still observed in null models in which the network topology is partially randomised .",
    "this approach has found successful applications in a great variety of fields , contributing to identifying relevant patterns , e.g. , in the world trade web @xcite and in interbank credit networks @xcite .",
    "we encode reciprocity as the fraction of mutual dyads in a network@xcite , and compare the impact it has in shaping user reputation in the three networks we study as opposed to the one observed in two ensembles of null models .",
    "we build a first ensemble by partially randomizing the empirical networks with a link reshuffling procedure designed to preserve the reputation on each user at a predefined level of positive or negative reciprocity .",
    "we then proceed to investigate the role of user homophily , which , as mentioned above , may act as a natural source of reciprocity , especially in platforms where the nature of positive interactions is particularly friendly , e.g. , where positive ratings are expressed by `` friending '' peers .",
    "this is particularly challenging with the data we employ , as they do not provide any categorisation of the nodes in terms of relevant features , which prevents any direct measurement of homophily . to this end",
    ", we devise a simple metric of preference similarity to quantify the propensity of pairs of nodes to agree in their endorsements or dislikes of other peers .",
    "we adopt such a metric as a proxy for homophily , and build a second null network ensemble through a link reshuffling procedure that preserves this quantity for each pair of nodes together with the reputation of each node . in conclusion , our work can not explicitly distinguish between `` malicious '' reciprocity ( as in the aforementioned @xmath0 for @xmath0 practice ) and `` benign '' reciprocity , but provides statistically robust results by assessing the likelihood of generating empirically observed features of p2p platforms through partially randomised dynamics .    within this framework , we quantify the role of rating reciprocity in distorting user reputations , and we eventually demonstrate that more reliable estimates of user reputation can be obtained by discounting reciprocated ratings from the least active users . as we will discuss in detail , the three case studies we analyse share a number of regularities despite the very different nature of the user interactions taking place in each of them .",
    "we analyse data from three p2p platforms : slashdot , epinions , and wikipedia ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "the data are freely available and can be downloaded from the koblenz network collection repository @xcite .",
    "we apply a filtering procedure to all three networks in order to discard the contributions from casual platform users and only retain the activity of actively engaged ones . in table",
    "[ tab : network_stats ] we provide details about the size and composition of such networks , and in appendix [ robust ] we provide detailed evidence that our results do not depend on the specificities of the filtering procedure .",
    ".[tab : network_stats ] * network statistics .",
    "* the first column shows the total number of nodes @xmath1 in the original unfiltered networks .",
    "the other columns show the number of users @xmath2 , the number of positive ( @xmath3 ) and negative ( @xmath4 ) ratings , and the sparsity @xmath5 ( measured as the ratio between the number of existing links and the overall number of possible links , i.e. @xmath6 ) of the networks when restricted to a high participation core of actively engaged users with at least ten combined ratings ( received and given ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : null_signs ] summarises our findings in such null model .",
    "namely , we report the values of positive / negative reciprocity @xmath7 and the contributions to reputation from reciprocated ( @xmath8 ) and unreciprocated ( @xmath9 ) links as measured in the empirical networks ( whose values are also reported in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and in the aforementioned null model . from a qualitative point of view , in most cases we observe the same results we obtained when analysing the results from the two null models discussed in the main paper .",
    "namely :    * in the empirical networks both positive and negative reciprocity are markedly over - expressed ( i.e. by more than one order of magnitude ) with respect to the null assumption . * the contribution to reputation from positive unreciprocated ( reciprocated ) activity @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) in the empirical networks is under - expressed ( over - expressed ) with respect to the null assumption . *",
    "whereas in all three networks we analyse we have @xmath12 , i.e. on average one reciprocated link contributes to reputation more than one unreciprocated link , under the above null assumption we observe the opposite relationship . *",
    "the average contribution to reputation from reciprocated negative links ( @xmath13 ) in the empirical networks is systematically over - expressed with respect to the above null assumption .    altogether ,",
    "the above points confirm that the reciprocity bias persists against a null assumption of random link and sign reshuffling in the positive case . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that the contribution to reputation from unreciprocated negative links ( @xmath14 ) measured in the empirical networks is compatible with the one measured under the above null assumption in the case of slashdot , and over - expressed in the case of epinions and wikipedia .",
    "this is at odds with the observations made in nm1 ( see appendix [ gen_nm1 ] ) , and indicates that a random redistribution of the ratings either preserves or underestimates the contribution to reputation from unilateral negative feedback .",
    "one of our main results concerns the fragility of the states observed in real - life p2p networks .",
    "indeed , as we show in the main paper , the random elimination of a small fraction ( i.e. @xmath15 depending on the network ) of reciprocated positive links is sufficient to remove the reciprocity bias and make the contribution to reputation from positive unreciprocated ratings ( @xmath10 ) and reciprocated ratings ( @xmath11 ) statistically compatible .",
    "let us remark that the protocol chosen to carry out the rating elimination procedure is crucially important to keep the fraction of removed ratings so low .",
    "indeed , the above efficiency is achieved only when selecting _ pairs of users _ at random .",
    "eliminating reciprocated ratings at random requires instead the elimination of a much larger number of ratings , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : link_removal ] . given",
    "the heavy tailed nature of the distributions of ratings given and received by each node ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : ratings_distr ] ) ) , this means that the most efficient way to decrease the contribution to reputation from reciprocated activity is to eliminate the reciprocated ratings between users with a lower number of ratings .",
    "in contrast , removing any rating with equal probability amounts to preferentially removing ratings between high activity users , i.e. hubs in the p2p network .",
    "we discuss in the main paper how this result is meaningful from the viewpoint of user incentives .",
    "all the results in our paper have been obtained by restricting empirical networks to a high participation core of actively engaged users with at least @xmath16 ratings ( either given or received ) . in this appendix",
    "we provide evidence that all the main results we discuss in the main paper are robust with respect to changes in the threshold @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , we discuss the case of an _ extended participation core _ to show the effects of a lower threshold ( @xmath18 ) , which allows to take into account the contribution of less actively engaged users . in table viii",
    "we report the number of nodes and positive / negative links for such networks .",
    "as it can be seen , consistently with the case @xmath19 , we still observe a large prevalence of positive links , which represent @xmath20 or more of the total links .",
    "the only slight qualitative difference with respect to the networks used in the main paper is an increase in sparsity , which is due to the inclusion of a substantial number of nodes with low activity .     &",

    "one can notice that essentially the reciprocity levels observed in the empirical networks and their relative magnitude with respect to those computed over null model samples remain qualitatively very similar .",
    "as a consequence of this fact , we still observe a substantial over - expression of reciprocity , especially in the positive case , with respect to the basal levels @xmath75 , and we still observe that slashdot and epinions display positive reciprocity close to their respective saturation levels @xmath76 ( especially those computed under nm2 ) , whereas wikipedia s positive and negative reciprocity remain quite far from the corresponding saturation levels .    in full analogy with the results reported in the main paper , we find that in the extended participation cores the average contribution @xmath11 to reputation from positive reciprocated ratings is systematically higher than the average contribution @xmath10 from unreciprocated positive ones . also in analogy with the restricted participation core analysed in the main paper , we again observe that only in slashdot the contribution to reputation from reciprocated negative ratings exceeds that from unreciprocated negative ones ( i.e. @xmath79 ) .          * a systematic over - expression of the average contribution to reputation from positive / negative reciprocated ratings ( @xmath8 ) in the empirical networks with respect to any null hypothesis ( i.e. for any value of @xmath92 or @xmath93 ) preserving the networks reputation landscape and the networks local preference similarity structure . * for large values of @xmath92 ( i.e. when the rewiring procedure is made very selective ) , the average contribution to reputation from positive unreciprocated ratings in the null models is larger than the average contribution from reciprocated positive ratings ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) over a wide range of reciprocity targets @xmath95 , as opposed to what is observed in the empirical networks .          as discussed in the main paper , we find the reciprocity bias to be a peculiar property of real - life p2p platforms . indeed , small perturbations are enough to make the contributions to reputation from unreciprocated ( @xmath10 ) and reciprocated ( @xmath11 ) positive ratings statistically compatible .",
    "we detect the same phenomenon in the extended participation core : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : link_removal_t5 ] , the removal of a small fraction of reciprocated positive ratings is enough to first make @xmath10 and @xmath11 statistically compatible , and to eventually make the former the prevalent contribution to reputation , as opposed to what is observed in the empirical networks . in particular , we find that the removal of @xmath96 randomly selected reciprocated positive ratings in slashdot ( which correspond to less than @xmath97 of the overall positive ratings ) is enough to make @xmath10 and @xmath11 statistically compatible .",
    "the same result is achieved by removing @xmath98 of the reciprocated positive ratings in epinions ( corresponding to @xmath99 of the overall positive ratings ) and @xmath100 of the reciprocated positive ratings in wikipedia ( i.e. @xmath101 of the overall positive ratings ) .        in full analogy with the case discussed in appendix [ link_el ] , we find that the link elimination protocol adopted to remove the ratings plays a crucial role in keeping the overall fractions of removed links so low . indeed",
    ", we find that the most efficient protocol is the one based on the random selection of pairs of nodes and the subsequent elimination of possible reciprocated ratings between them . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : link_removal_t5 ] a protocol based on the random selection of links is much less efficient and entails the removal of substantial portions of links in order to achieve statistical compatibility between @xmath102 and @xmath10",
