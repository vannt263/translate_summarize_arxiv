    "the prompt photon production in dis @xmath3 collisions is an interesting reaction involving , in the theoretical description provided by qcd , several perturbative and non perturbative quantities related to virtual and real photons . at first sight the subprocess associated with the prompt photon production appears particularly simple .",
    "it is the compton effect of a virtual photon on a quark with a real photon and a quark in the final state : @xmath4 .",
    "the theoretical description of this process only requires the knowledge of the quark distributions in the proton and the calculation of higher order ( ho ) qcd corrections , the latter opening the way to a quantitative comparison with experimental data .    actually , as always with photons , the situation is quite complex .",
    "we also have to consider the reaction in which the initial virtual photon fluctuates into a state made of collinear quarks and gluons described by the virtual photon structure function . in the final state also , a large-@xmath5 quark can radiate a real collinear photon , a process which involves a perturbative part the bremsstrahlung of the photon and a non perturbative part , and which is described by the photon fragmentation function .",
    "therefore the complete description of the prompt photon production requires the calculation of four classes of processes .",
    "two classes involving the virtual photon structure function with the final photon either directly coupled to a quark of the hard subprocess ( the resolved - direct process ) or produced through the final fragmentation of a parton ( the resolved - fragmented process ) .",
    "the two other classes involve the direct coupling of the virtual photon to a quark of the hard subprocess with a direct final photon ( the direct - direct process ) or with a photon fragment of a parton ( the direct - fragmented process ) .",
    "all four processes corresponding to these four topologies having , as we shall see below , the same order of magnitude .",
    "photons can also be emitted by the lepton line .",
    "we do not consider this contribution in this paper .",
    "it can be obtained , from ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the experimental side , h1 and",
    "zeus @xcite have measured the prompt photon inclusive cross sections for which no qcd ho calculations exist .",
    "h1 also measured the production of a prompt photon associated with a jet . for",
    "this latter reaction a ho calculation does exist @xcite which concerns the direct production .",
    "the fragmentation process is also taken into account and many observables are discussed in ref .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present qcd ho calculations for the four processes of inclusive production of prompt photons in dis @xmath3 collisions , and to compare the theoretical predictions with h1 and zeus data .",
    "we do not consider the production of a photon and a jet .",
    "but the approach of this paper is directly applicable to this latter case .",
    "an important point in the definition of the prompt photon cross section is that of the reference frame in which the large-@xmath5 photon is observed .",
    "there are two standards at hera , the photon - proton ( center of mass ) cm system ( hadronic system ) and the laboratory frame . in the first one",
    "the observed large-@xmath5 particle is produced , at lowest order , via @xmath6 subprocesses .",
    "this frame has been used in almost all large-@xmath5 reactions at hera .",
    "we shall work in such a frame in the present paper .",
    "it is natural in photoproduction in which the almost real initial photon is collinear with the initial electron . for instance",
    "the photoproduction of prompt photons , which is the @xmath7 limit of the dis reaction , has been studied in this frame .",
    "a lower cut - off in @xmath5 is necessary for perturbative qcd to be valid .",
    "the forward production of a @xmath8 , or a jet , in the dis reaction has also been studied with this low - pt cut - off which picks @xmath6 subprocesses ( and their ho corrections ) to produce large-@xmath5 forward partons with the aim to test the importance of the bfkl dynamics @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison with experimental results was performed and a good agreement of theoretical results with the data was found @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in the laboratory in which a @xmath6 subprocess is no more necessary to produce a large-@xmath5 particle .",
    "the transverse momentum of the observed photon may come from that of the virtual photon @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the inelasticity ) through the basic dis subprocess @xmath11 quark @xmath12 quark , followed by the emission of the photon from the final quark .",
    "the authors of references @xcite have proposed to use this frame as a way to attain the quark into photon fragmentation function , and have done a detailed study of this reaction at order @xmath13 .",
    "therefore the choice of a frame amounts to emphasize a given subprocess and the related non perturbative quantities . to be short",
    "one could say that the laboratory frame emphasizes the fragmentation part , whereas the @xmath14-@xmath15 frame emphasizes the virtual photon structure function and the fragmentation part .",
    "unfortunately only isolated photons have been observed at hera , corresponding to a strong suppression of contributions involving fragmentation functions .",
    "of course it is not necessary to fix the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the observed photon in the @xmath14-@xmath15 frame .",
    "this can be done in the laboratory .",
    "we only have to check that the subprocess in the @xmath14-@xmath15 frame involves a large @xmath5 scale .",
    "for instance h1 , when observing forward ( in the laboratory ) and large-@xmath16 ( in the laboratory ) @xmath8 , requires a cut on the transverse momentum of the @xmath8 in the hadronic frame @xcite .",
    "we shall follow this procedure in this paper .    in the next section",
    "we give details on the ho calculations in the hadronic frame . in section 3",
    "we present results for the inclusive cross section as a function of @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we discuss the effect of isolation ( isolated prompt photons are measured by h1 and zeus ) .",
    "then we examine , in section 4 , the possibility to relate our @xmath14-@xmath15 results with the h1 and zeus results obtained with no @xmath5 cut in the hadronic frame .",
    "we will identify laboratory phase space regions in which this cut is not necessary to insure a large-@xmath5 in the @xmath14-@xmath15 frame .",
    "section 5 is a conclusion .",
    "the programs containing a fragmentation function , which describe the resolved - fragmented and the direct - fragmented processes , can be immediately obtained from the programs of @xmath8 production in dis @xmath3 reactions @xcite .",
    "the only change is that of the fragmentation functions ; we now use the bourhis - fontannaz - guillet ( set ii ) @xcite fragmentation functions .",
    "the programs describing the direct - direct and resolved - direct processes can be obtained from the preceeding ones by selecting the subprocesses with a final gluon and changing the charges and colour factors .",
    "thus we obtain the cross sections corresponding to the emission of a photon .    in all these programs",
    "the ho corrections associated with a @xmath20 subprocesses are calculated in dividing the phase space of the third final parton , which can be soft , in three parts : a small cylinder around the initial momenta ( in the hadronic frame in which the virtual photon and the proton one collinear ) , a small cone around the two final hard partons , and the rest of the phase space . the cylinder allows us to treat the collinear and soft singularities associated with the initial partons .",
    "the cones allow us to calculate the collinear and soft singularities associated with the final partons . in the rest of the phase space the @xmath21 cross sections have no singularities and the integration is performed by a monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "this approach is described in details in references @xcite .",
    "it is at the root of all the programs of the phox - family @xcite .",
    "what is peculiar to dis @xmath3 reactions is the presence of a virtual photon structure functions .",
    "several problems are raised by these functions ; for instance the implementation of the @xmath22 factorization scheme , their nlo evolution , their parametrizations .",
    "a detailed discussion of all these points has been given in reference @xcite . here",
    "one can only keep in mind that the available nlo parametrization are given in the @xmath22 factorization scheme .",
    "as only isolated photons are observed in the hera experiments , we have implemented an isolation criteria .",
    "we will use a cone criterion in the hadronic frame requiring no more than @xmath23 hadronic transverse energy in a cone of radius @xmath24 surrounding the photon , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( a value @xmath27 will be used when comparing theoretical results with h1 and zeus data with our conventions . ] ) .",
    "the photon transverse energy can be fixed in the hadronic frame , in which we require a minimum value of the latter for a perturbative approach to be valid .",
    "this cut also eliminates contributions from the collinear subprocess @xmath28 followed by the bremsstrahlung of a final photon .",
    "the photon kinematics can also be fixed in the laboratory , as it is done by h1 and zeus . in this case , after a boost to the hadronic frame , the photon transverse energy may be very small .",
    "we suppress the contributions corresponding to this configuration by requiring again a minimum transverse energy in the hadronic frame . in the next section we present results obtained `` in the laboratory frame '' in order to be close to the kinematics used by the hera experiments , but with a cut in the hadronic frame .",
    "the calculations of the photon - jet cross sections could proceed in a similar way .",
    "we just have to introduce a jet algorithm in the routines calculating the @xmath21 subprocesses , specifying how two final partons are combined to form a jet .",
    "the interest of the photon- jet cross sections is due to the simultaneous measurement of the photon @xmath29 and jet @xmath30 four momenta , which allows us to define the invariant mass @xmath31 .",
    "whatever the frame in which these momenta are measured , perturbative qcd calculations are valid if @xmath32 is large enough and we do not need any more a @xmath33 cut in the hadronic frame @xcite .",
    "in this section we present the cross sections corresponding to the four topologies described in the introduction , and we consider non isolated and isolated photons .",
    "we adopt kinematical parameters close to those of the hera experiments to make later comparisons with h1 and zeus easier .",
    "the beam energies of the proton and lepton are respectively 920  gev and 27.6  gev leading to @xmath34  gev .",
    "the inelasticity @xmath35 is taken in the range @xmath36 and the photon virtuality @xmath19 in the range 4 gev@xmath37  gev@xmath38 .",
    "( @xmath15 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the four momenta of the proton , the initial lepton and the virtual photon ) .",
    "the cross section involving the exchange of the @xmath41-boson are neglected .",
    "the rapidity of the photon in the laboratory frame is @xmath42 and the transverse energy 10 gev @xmath43  gev . in this section",
    "we do not consider the other cuts put by h1 and zeus on the scattering angle of the lepton , on the momentum of the outgoing lepton and on the invariant mass @xmath44 that we shall introduce in section 4 when comparing with data .",
    "finally , in order to stay in a perturbative regime , we require the photon to have , in the hadronic frame , a minimum transverse momentum @xmath45  gev .",
    "we use the cteq6 m distribution functions @xcite , the parton distributions in the virtual photon of ref . @xcite and the bfg photon fragmentation functions ( set ii ) @xcite .",
    "we work with @xmath46 flavors .    ,",
    "width=336,height=240 ]    fig . 1 to fig . 4 present the cross sections @xmath47 corresponding to the four topologies discussed in the introduction .",
    "we must keep in mind that these results are factorization scheme dependent .",
    "they depend on the initial factorization , final factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "only the sum of the four partial cross sections has a physical meaning .",
    "the scales used in this section are @xmath48 for the proton factorization scale , @xmath49 for the virtual photon factorization scale , @xmath50 for the fragmentation factorization scale and @xmath51 for the renormalization scale , with @xmath52 .",
    "all our calculations are performed in the @xmath53 factorization scheme .",
    "in particular the ho terms with a direct final photon are obtained from one - loop calculations from which final collinear singularities are subtracted with the @xmath53 convention .",
    ", width=336,height=240 ]    , width=336,height=240 ]    , width=336,height=240 ]    let us first consider the production of inclusive non isolated photons and let us start with the born terms ( figs",
    ".  1 - 4 ) .",
    "as expected the largest contribution comes from the direct - direct reaction .",
    "however the other reactions are not negligible .",
    "the direct - fragmented contribution is a factor 2 below the direct - direct one , and each of the resolved contributions another factor two below so that the direct - direct contribution represents only half of the full cross section .",
    "the ho corrections are important .",
    "we display in the figures the total = born + ho cross section for each class . the ho corrections almost double the born terms for the components involving fragmentation .",
    "this is due to the large number of subprocesses participating in the cross sections . for the contributions with a final direct photon",
    ", the pattern is different .",
    "for instance in the direct - direct case the ho corrections are very negative for @xmath54 smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "this produces an important correction of the cross section especially in the negative @xmath54 range .",
    "the peculiarities of the direct - direct reaction is the presence of only one subprocess at the born level , namely @xmath56 , and the presence of strong kinematical constraints ( parton distributions in the photon and fragmentation functions replaced by delta - functions ) .",
    "when the isolation is switched on , we obtain an interesting pattern of born terms and ho corrections .",
    "as expected we have a strong decrease of the born sections involving fragmentation functions of about a factor six , or even larger in the forward direction .",
    "therefore these born cross sections are almost negligible compared to the direct born cross section on which the isolation has no effect . for the ho order corrections the decreases are less pronounced compared to the born terms and they even increase in the cases of final direct photons ; for instance by a factor 2 for the resolved - direct case .",
    "this increase of the isolated total cross section , for the case where the photon is directly produced in the final state ( figs .  1 and 3 ) , has already been observed and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which studies the prompt photon production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "it is due to the fact that some ho final collinear contributions are subtracted from the ho direct cross section to build the fragmentation functions .",
    "the remaining collinear terms are negative and the subtracted ho direct contribution increases when these negative terms are cut by the isolation .",
    "of course this effect is factorization scheme dependent and demonstrates once more that only the sum of the cross sections has a physical meaning ( the total cross section must decrease when the isolation is switched on ) .",
    "5 truemm    .,width=336,height=240 ]    .,width=336,height=240 ]    in conclusion , we observe that the resolved - direct isolated cross section is larger than the non isolated one ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this is also true for the direct - direct cross section with a very different behavior in rapidity ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the isolated resolved - fragmented and the direct - fragmented cross sections are small compared to the isolated resolved - direct and direct - direct contributions , but not totally negligible .    in figs .  5 and 6 we finally show the contributions of the resolved and the direct processes for the cross section @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( isolated case ) .",
    "these figures illustrate the non negligible contributions of the resolved components specially for negative values of the photon rapidity .",
    "unlike what was done until now for the production of large @xmath59 hadrons or jets , the h1 and zeus experiments do not put , in the case of prompt photons , kinematical cuts in the hadronic system and it is easy to check that their laboratory cuts do not protect the hadronic system @xmath60 against small numerical values .",
    "thus the possibility of performing a perturbative calculation is not ensured .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath10 being fixed by the observation of the outgoing lepton , we have to calculate the expression [ 1e ] dq^2 dy g(x ) ^ t _",
    "q^4 ^(4 ) ( p + q - p_4 - p_3 ) d_4  dy_4  d_3  dy_3  ,    the definition of the momenta being given in fig .",

    "we see that we can ensure a minimum value of @xmath64 , the subprocess center - of - mass energy squared , with the requirement @xmath65 .    to discuss the constraints on @xmath66 let us consider the extreme case where @xmath67 is parallel to @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . with the definition @xmath70 and with @xmath71",
    "we get from the constraints ( [ 2e ] ) [ 4.3e ] & & x = x_b_j = q^2 y s_ep + & & e^y_4 = 2y^0  .    the first result is the standard constraint associated with the @xmath28 subprocess ; the second result shows that @xmath66 can not be large if @xmath19 is small and @xmath10 bounded from below .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath72 . with the h1 cut @xmath73",
    "we obtain @xmath74 , which shows that the collinear configuration ( @xmath69 ) does not contribute to the cross section in the small @xmath5 and large @xmath66 domain .          to determine the exact phase space domain in which our calculation is valid , we explore , for large value of @xmath66 or for small values of @xmath19 , the sensitivity of the cross section to @xmath75- cuts .",
    "in this study we switch to the exact h1 cuts which include the conditions @xmath76  gev , @xmath77 and @xmath78  gev .",
    "now the values of the inelasticity @xmath10 are bounded below by @xmath79 , and we have @xmath80  gev@xmath1 .",
    "we also implement the isolation criterion in the laboratory frame by requiring a limited hadronic energy @xmath81 in a cone of radius @xmath24 around the photon .",
    "this isolation is different from that defined in the hadronic frame since parton 3 ( fig .",
    "7 ) can now be inside the isolation cone because of the transverse boost provided by the virtual photon .",
    "we use the isolation parameters @xmath27 and @xmath82 .",
    "we perform our exploration of the `` safe '' domains by studying the direct - direct cross section . a typical result that we obtain for the small @xmath19 domain @xmath83  gev@xmath1",
    "is given in table 1 .",

    "we find a good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "note that the last column of table 3 has been obtained by multiplying the predictions of table 2 by the hadronic correction factors @xmath88 given by h1 @xcite .",
    "the small resolved - fragmented contribution has not been taken into account ; we estimate this contribution to be approximatively equal to 6  % of the total cross sections .",
    "note also that the contributions due to the emission of photons by the lepton line is not    taken into account .",
    "the h1 collaboration has estimated this contribution @xcite .",
    "it is almost negligible ( @xmath89 ) in domain @xmath90 , it represents about @xmath91 of the theoretical cross section ( table  3 ) in domain @xmath92 , and is totally negligible in domain @xmath93 .",
    "the zeus collaboration measured the isolated photon cross section at the energy @xmath94  gev using the following cuts : @xmath76  gev , @xmath95 and @xmath96  gev .",

    "the @xmath100 cut - off could be achieved for low @xmath101  gev@xmath1 , or large photon rapidity @xmath102 with moderate @xmath19 values , however none of these domains can be extracted from the published zeus data . restricting to large @xmath103 values , @xmath104 @xmath105  gev",
    ", we have tested that it is imposssible to obtain stability in the full @xmath19 range of zeus .",
    "a relative stability of our predictions is achieved , however , when one restricts the @xmath19 range between 10 and 20  gev@xmath1 integrating over the whole range for the other variables : we find a cross section ( with only the d - d and d - f contributions ) decreasing from .164 down to .152  pb / gev@xmath1 , when decreasing the cut - off from 2.5 to 1 .",
    "gev ( the d - d ho are not stable ) . multiplying the result by a factor 2 to roughly take into account the resolved contribution , we obtain a cross section of .37 pb / gev@xmath1 ( including a contribution of .045 pb / gev@xmath1 from the lepton line ) compatible with the value of .414 @xmath106 .035 ( stat . )",
    "pb / gev@xmath1 given by zeus .",
    "a complete calculation of the isolated photon cross section in deep inelastic scattering has been presented at the next to leading logarithmic order in qcd .",
    "isolation can be imposed in the hadronic center of mass frame or in the laboratory frame .",
    "the calculation includes four classes of processes depending on whether the photon is coupled directly to the hard process or through structure or fragmentation functions and it is valid if the momentum of the photon in the hadronic center of mass frame is large enough to prevent the 2@xmath1071 process , @xmath108 , to occur in a collinear configuration .",
    "unfortunately the h1 and zeus collaborations for their isolated prompt photon studies do not impose a transverse momentum cut - off in the hadronic center of masss frame but in the laboratory frame .",
    "this is unlike what was done for their studies on particle or jet production .",
    "the comparison between our calculation and the data can be performed only in a very restricted domain of the data : small @xmath19 and/or large photon rapidity",
    ". it would be interesting if data could be available with a transverse momentum cut in the hadronic frame : a comparison with large transverse momentum @xmath8 production , will then be possible and it is an exercise always worth making as is done in hadronic colliders",
    ". the basic mechanisms of photon and @xmath8 production are different and so are the higher order corrections : a detailed comparison of theory with data in the case of photon production with many kinematical variables at hand ( @xmath19 , @xmath103 , @xmath54 , @xmath109 ) will be very constraining , as it was for @xmath8 production .    99 rapgap , h. jung , comput .",
