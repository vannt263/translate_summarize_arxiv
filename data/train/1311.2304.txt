    "<S> in fact , the numerical treatment of two - electron systems like he or h@xmath0 is today still state of the art @xcite . thus , simplified models are widely used for interpreting modern experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these models are controversial and their validation is difficult for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the used light pulses are bound to the specifications of the laser . the wavelength range of lasers is limited , mostly ti : sapphire lasers are used . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse shapes are restricted and can often only be reproduced and determined up to a considerable uncertainty . the intensity and timescale of laser pulses </S>",

    "<S> their internal structure can not be simply manipulated . for example , a variation of the number of electrons or protons underlies constraints due to electroneutrality . </S>",
    "<S> third , although the correlation of electronic and nuclear motion is known to influence the ionization behavior @xcite , in most theoretical models this effect is neglected by fixing the nuclei in space while investigating the electronic response to the laser field .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the concept of an ultracold - atom quantum simulator for attosecond science which offers great flexibility and control beyond the mentioned limitations . </S>",
    "<S> this includes many - body quantum simulations that are impossible with any classical computer .    </S>",
    "<S> _ the attoscience simulator . </S>",
    "<S> _ the simulator system consists of ultracold trapped atoms that replace the electrons in the atom , ion , or molecule , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the core potential is replaced by an external , optical trapping potential . </S>",

    "<S> the intense laser pulse is replaced by a periodically driven magnetic - field gradient which is generated by current - carrying coils . </S>",
    "<S> restrictions for ultrashort laser fields like the zero - net - force condition @xcite do not apply here and thus fields of almost arbitrary shape can be created , even true half - cycle pulses and fields that formally correspond to sub - attosecond pulses .    </S>",
    "<S> certainly , the atom - atom interaction is shorter ranged than the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> however , earlier quantum simulations like the famous superfluid to mott - insulator phase transition @xcite demonstrated that an equivalent physics is obtainable . </S>",
    "<S> the use of ultracold atoms introduces the unique opportunity to arbitrarily vary the effective interaction strength _ via _ magnetic feshbach resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this promises new insights on the influence of the interparticle interaction on the ionization behavior . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , theoretical studies which replace the core potential by , e.g. , a zero - range potential @xcite , can now be tested experimentally , and this even for many - particle systems . </S>",
    "<S> since ultracold quantum systems are manipulated nowadays on the single - atom level @xcite , important tests of the widely used single - active - electron approximation and a detailed investigation of correlated many - body tunneling become accessible . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , only the simulator allows for the experimental realization of fixed nuclei  a task impossible with real molecules due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of a fixed nuclear geometry on the ionization behavior @xcite can thus be tested experimentally in a clean fashion . additionally , the differences between the quantum - mechanical nature of vibronic states and the simulation of a mechanical vibration of the nuclei can be investigated .    </S>",

    "<S> the formal equivalence of the quantum simulator hamiltonian to the electronic strong - field hamiltonian at a fixed nuclear configuration is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> when treating the strong laser field classically , which is acceptable due to its high intensity , and applying dipole approximation and length gauge ( lg ) , respectively , the electronic strong - field hamiltonian reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the field - free hamiltonian for @xmath3 electrons . </S>",

    "<S> is usually adopted in which the ionization is described within a simplified picture as an absorption of photons , despite the fact that in the theoretical treatment the electromagnetic field is treated classically .    in the multiphoton regime ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]a and b ) , both spectra show the typical multi - peak structure ( above - threshold - ionization peaks ) where the peak distance reflects the frequency of the perturbing field . clearly , simulator and hydrogen atom show very good agreement . despite the different dimensionalities the tdse solutions </S>",
    "<S> agree , in fact , almost quantitatively .    in the quasistatic regime ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]c and d ) , a simple tunneling picture suggests an exponential decrease in the energy - resolved spectra , as is seen in the low - energy part ( up to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ponderomotive energy and @xmath37 the laser intensity ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a periodically changing field the emitted electron or atom can reverse its direction of motion and recollide , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] . high - harmonic generation in strong - field physics is based on the recombination of the liberated electron with the parent ion at the recollision step . </S>",
    "<S> using classical newtonian mechanics it had been found that high - harmonic spectra extend up to @xmath38 @xcite . for energy resolved electron spectra , the recollision process leads to a broad energy distribution of the rescattered electrons which manifests in a plateau as observed in @xcite and clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]d . in analogy to the high - harmonic cutoff law </S>",
    "<S> classical newtonian mechanics predicts an extension of this plateau between @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the simulator shows all expected features , both from tunneling and rescattering . </S>",
    "<S> however , the more pronounced structures in the plateaus of the 1d systems ( simulator and 1d hydrogen atom ) reveal effects of the dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> such effects can be studied with the simulator even experimentally by varying the anisotropy of the trap  a task impossible in strong - field experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> rescattering is the origin of nonsequential double ionization , high - energy above - threshold ionization , and high - order harmonic generation . </S>",
    "<S> a controlled recollision , see fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , of an escaped atom on residual bound atoms prepared in a specific configuration with variable interaction strength can reveal insights into correlated recollision dynamics relevant , e.g. , for high harmonics @xcite and non - sequential double ionization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , inspired by the experiments on imaging molecular orbitals using laser - induced electron tunneling and diffraction @xcite controlled rescattering collisions can serve for the imaging of ultracold many - body wavefunctions .    </S>",
    "<S> _ strong - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> _ in the widely used strong - field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite bound states of the potential other than the initial state are neglected and the final continuum state is replaced by a volkov state , i.e.  the solution of a free electron in a laser field . therefore , the interaction of the electron with the remaining ion is ignored in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sfa does not support rescattering as can also be seen in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]c and d. on the other hand , the direct electrons and atoms ( up to @xmath39 ) in the quasistatic regime in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]c and d are qualitatively well described by the sfa . similarly , the sfa reproduces the multi - peak structure in the multiphoton regime , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]a and b. note , the sfa is not gauge invariant and so far no arguments from first principles are known what gauge is to be preferred in which situation @xcite ( the gauge problem of sfa ) . in the simulator system , </S>",
    "<S> the number of trap states as well as the potential range can be varied which allows for an analysis of the assumptions and the gauge ambiguity of the sfa .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the sfa in velocity gauge allows to obtain the momentum density of the initial state since the energy - resolved yield is a product of the momentum - space density @xmath41 and a prefactor @xmath42 @xcite . for a given momentum @xmath43 , the prefactor @xmath44 depends solely on the vector potential @xmath26 and the binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the corresponding strong - field experiments , these parameters are known precisely for the quantum simulator because of the exactly known pulse shape . </S>",
    "<S> note , this imaging technique relies on the agreement of the sfa in velocity gauge with the full tdse results , which is fulfilled as seen in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]a and c despite the fact that the simulator mapping ( [ eq : mapping ] ) is bound to the length gauge . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this imaging technique indeed allows to image the momentum density of an ultracold gas in a trap .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> _ a proposal for a quantum simulator for attosecond physics is presented based on ultracold atoms in an optical trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> the simulator idea connects the very contrary physics of ultracold , trapped atomic gases and the one of atoms , ions , and molecules in ultra - intense , ultra - short laser fields . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints one faces in strong - field experiments , such as the limitation to a specific molecular geometry , a fixed number of electrons per element or molecule , fixed interaction strengths , and limited pulse shapes are overcome in the simulator system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the simulation can even reach parameter regions which are beyond those nowadays realizable in strong - field experiments , including , e.g. , exotic pulse shapes and effective pulse durations corresponding to the sub - attosecond regime . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the here proposed attosecond science in slow motion may shed light onto the ongoing debate on tunneling times @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical analysis of the here proposed concrete experimental realization of the quantum simulator with realistic experimental parameters demonstrates that it reproduces in its simplest configuration the ionization characteristics of a hydrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> while this simple demonstrating example can be evaluated computationally , the simulator paves the way to systematically investigate many - body systems where the full numerical treatment is beyond the reach of any classical computer . </S>",
