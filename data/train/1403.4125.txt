    "during the last decade we have witnessed a rapidly growing interest in quantum states in lower dimensions with non - trivial braiding statistics . in particular bound states at zero - energy",
    "have attracted a lot of attention .",
    "for instance , a plethora of new setups that can host majorana fermions ( mfs ) , particles that are their own antiparticles , has been suggested @xcite and motivated many experiments to test these predictions.@xcite these exotic particles are interesting not only from a fundamental point of view but also find a direct application in topological quantum computing schemes.@xcite majorana fermions are non - abelian anyons with a braiding statistics of the ising - type . such anyons allow to implement some of fundamental quantum operations but not all of them.@xcite to extend the class of operations , one can work with parafermions ( pfs ) that possess even more exotic braiding statistics arising in the presence of strong electron - electron interactions.@xcite so far , the search for most experimentally feasible setups continues as well as a discussion on which path to follow . on one hand , one can generate mfs and try to supplement their braiding statistics with non - topological gates . on the other hand , one can aim at generating non - abelian braiding statistics of the fibonacci type from a sea of parafermions.@xcite    in the present work we focus on kramers pairs of majorana fermions@xcite and parafermions.@xcite the basic ingredients of our setup are two topological insulators@xcite brought into proximity to a superconductor .",
    "we assume that the chemical potential lies in the topological gap , so we focus only on edge modes , signatures of which were recently observed in experiments.@xcite we also note that the proximity coupling between superconductors and topological insulators were also successfully implemented.@xcite schemes for majorana fermions in topological insulators with proximity effect have been first proposed by fu and kane@xcite and implemented in recent experiments@xcite , where a finite magnetic field was crucial .",
    "however , considering that magnetic fields have detrimental effects on both topological insulators and superconductors , we are motivated to keep time - reversal invariance in the system and to avoid magnetic fields altogether .",
    "this requires a different approach where the competition between zeeman gap and superconducting proximity gap is replaced by a different mechanism , as we outline next .",
    "the proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor induces superconducting pairings between edge modes that have opposite momenta and spins .",
    "importantly for us , there are two competing superconducting mechanisms .",
    "the first one is the usual pairing that corresponds to a process where a cooper pair tunnels as a whole in one of topological insulators .",
    "this process induces a coupling between right and left movers that also have opposite spins as a consequence of time - reversal invariance.@xcite the second mechanism is based on a non - local or ` crossed andreev ' pairing@xcite and corresponds to the case when a cooper pair gets split between two topological insulators : one electron from the cooper pair tunnels into one of the topological insulators , while its partner tunnels into the other one .",
    "the crossed andreev pairing dominates over the usual one in the regime of strong electron - electron interactions if the separation between edge states of neighboring topological insultors does not exceed the coherence length and the fermi wavelength of the superconductor.@xcite if the edges are separated by a large distance , the crossed andreev pairing gets suppressed , and the usual one dominates .",
    "all this allows us to create interfaces between two different types of induced superconductivity where the two gap mechanisms compete .",
    "in such a case , one can expect the emergence of zero - energy bound states .    indeed",
    ", we demonstrate that the crossed andreev and usual pairing also compete with each other in the opening of gaps in the energy spectrum .",
    "importantly , if all pairings are of the same strength , the system is gapless .",
    "this signals the existence of two topologically distinct phases . as a consequence",
    ", there are zero - energy bound states at the interfaces between regions dominated either by the crossed andreev or by the usual pairing . due to the preserved time - reversal symmetry ,",
    "these bounds states are kramers pairs of majorana fermions for standard topological insulators , while they are pairs of parafermions for fractional topological insulators which carry edge states that obey fractional statistics.@xcite    we consider two setups that both are based on the competition between local and non - local pairing mechanisms .",
    "however , they differ by the direction of edge mode propagation in each topological insulator ( or equivalently by the directions of spin orbit vectors ) . in our first , _ para - helical _ , setup considered in sec .",
    "ii , edge modes with the same spins propagate in the same direction along their common boundary in both topological insulators .",
    "in contrast to that , in our second , _ ortho - helical _ , setup considered in sec .",
    "iii , edge modes with opposite spins propagate in the same direction along their common boundary . in spite of this difference",
    ", our main result on the presence of zero - energy bound states with non - abelian statistics holds for both setups .",
    ") that are tunnel - coupled to an underlying @xmath0-wave superconductor ( yellow ) which induces superconducting proximity effects in the tis .",
    "the chemical potentials , controlled by the gates ( light blue ) , are _ the same _ in the two samples , @xmath1 .",
    "the helical edge modes ( blue and red lines with arrows ) in the tis circulate in _ opposite _ directions due to opposite spin orbit interaction vectors .",
    "the crossed andreev pairing dominates over the usual pairing along the common boundary of the two tis ( along the @xmath2 direction ) .",
    "in contrast to that , along the @xmath3 direction the dominant pairing is the usual one produced by cooper pairs tunneling into each of the tis as a whole .",
    "the propagation direction of spin - downs defines the @xmath4 axis .",
    "the interfaces between two such regions at @xmath5 and at @xmath6 ( shown by dashed lines ) host the zero - energy bound states such as kramers pairs of majorana fermions or kramers pairs of parafermions depending on the nature of the ti ( see text ) . ]      the first setup we consider consists of two two - dimensional topological insulators ( tis),@xcite labeled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , that are brought into proximity to an @xmath0-wave superconductor , see fig .",
    "[ fig : soi ] .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath9 , are assumed to be equal , @xmath1 , and tuned inside the band gaps of the topological insulators .",
    "the topologically protected edge modes propagate along the edges of the system in the direction determined by the spin orbit interaction ( soi ) vector . in this section , we consider systems in which modes with the same spin direction propagate in the same direction along their common boundary .",
    "this can be achieved by placing two identical tis on top of each other separated by a thin insulating layer , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ti_bilayer ] .",
    "alternatively , we can consider schemes involving samples with opposite signs of spin orbit interaction in the two tis [ for example , 1 ) by growing two samples with reversed order of layers in the heterostructure , 2 ) by flipping one of two identically grown samples ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig : soi ] .",
    "thus , edge modes with spin up propagate , say , in the clockwise ( anticlockwise ) direction in the upper ( lower ) system @xmath7 ( @xmath10 ) , where we choose the spin quantization axis to be along the @xmath11 axis perpendicular to the plane of the 2d system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : soi ] . as a consequence ,",
    "both spin - up ( down ) modes propagate to the right ( left ) along their common boundaries .",
    "further , we refer to this setup as the _ para - helical _ one ( since the spin orbit vectors are opposite to each other ) .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian is written as @xmath12 , \\label{ho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the slowly - varying right ( left ) mover field of the @xmath14 system @xmath15 [ @xmath16 are defined around the fermi points @xmath17 that are determined by the position of the chemical potential @xmath9 . here",
    ", we choose the @xmath4 axis to be always aligned with the propagation direction of the spin - down edge modes .",
    "next , we explore all possible proximity induced superconducting pairings taking into account that they should couple modes with opposite momenta and opposite spins .",
    "first , cooper pairs that tunnel together as a whole into each of the two systems lead to the usual proximity induced superconductivity of strength @xmath18 dependent on the tunnel coupling between the superconductor and the tis , see fig .",
    "[ spectrum_soi ] .",
    "the corresponding pairing hamiltonian describing this usual proximity pairing takes the form @xmath19 . \\label{htau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    second , in addition to the usual proximity effect induced in each of the two systems separately , there is a crossed ( or split ) andreev process that induces a superconductivity of strength @xmath20 in both systems simultaneously .",
    "such superconducting pairing corresponds to a process when cooper pairs get split so that one partner of the pair tunnels into one system and its partner into the other one .",
    "consequently , such a split pairing dominates in the regime of strong electron - electron interactions since it costs less energy to insert only one electron into one edge state compared to inserting two electrons into the same edge state .",
    "@xcite one should also note that the crossed andreev pairing strength @xmath20 gets exponentially suppressed if the distance between the edge states of the upper and the lower tis @xmath21 is exceeds the coherence length of the superconductor.@xcite moreover , @xmath20 is suppressed as an inverse power law of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the fermi wavevector of a two- or three - dimensional bulk superconductor .",
    "this suppression can be overcome , however , by using an intermediate layer of proximity induced superconductor with smaller @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite in addition , such a spatial dependence of the crossed andreev process enables us to envisage a third variation of the para - helical setup , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ti_alternative ] .",
    "this setup consists of two identical topological insulators with equal chemical potentials brought into proximity to a t - shaped superconductor .",
    "the crossed andreev term is the strongest around @xmath5 away from which it decays and gives way to the usual superconducting pairing at @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as a result",
    ", we again arrive at interfaces between two regions dominated by different pairing mechanisms . in what follows we focus on the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : soi ] due to the simplicity of treatment of uniform pairings .",

    "again , there are two interfaces separating the two regions , each of them containing kramers pairs of bound states .",
    "note that while at one interface ( located at the corner of the l - shaped slab ) the bound states are well - localized , there are spread out over the normal region edge states forming the other interface . ]",

    "[ spectrum_soi ] .    both crossed andreev and usual superconducting pairings open a full gap in the spectrum . as a result",

    "[ fig : soi ] . in one region ,",
    "the dominating superconducting pairing arises from the crossed andreev term @xmath27 ; in the other region , the crossed andreev superconducting pairing is suppressed , so the edge modes are gapped only by the usual superconducting terms @xmath28 .",
    "such interfaces can potentially host exotic bound states ( with non - trivial braiding statistics ) , which is the focus of the following sections .     corresponding to the para - helical setups shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : soi ] and [ fig : ti_bilayer ] .",
    "the proximity induced pairing amplitude @xmath18 induces coupling between edge modes from the same ti , resulting in proximity gaps at the fermi level in each ti separately .",
    "if the chemical potentials @xmath9 are the same in the two samples , @xmath29 , the crossed andreev pairing with amplitude @xmath20 couples a spin - up state at the fermi level in the upper ti ( @xmath7 , red arrow ) with a spin - down state at the fermi level in the lower ti ( @xmath30 , blue arrow ) , and vice versa .",

    "the decay along the @xmath3 axis is determined by the coherence length and the fermi wavelength of the superconductor .",
    "in contrast , the decay along the @xmath2 axis is much faster and arises due to a momentum mismatch between the spin - up helical edge states of one ti and the spin - down helical edge states of the other ti . as a result , there are two interfaces between different superconducting pairing regimes at @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ]      in this subsection , we consider an effective non - interacting single particle model of topological insulator edge modes with excitations possessing an elementary electron charge @xmath33.@xcite this allows us to work within the fermionic nambu representation in the basis of eight fermion operators,@xcite @xmath34 . the hamiltonian density @xmath35 , defined via @xmath36 and the corresponding total hamiltonian @xmath37 [ see eqs .",
