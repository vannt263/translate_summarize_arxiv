    "we introduce some necessary definitions involving the set of trace preserving positive maps and its relevant subsets or supersets , which will allow us to present an overview of the results obtained in this paper ( summarized in tables 2 - 4 ) .",
    "section [ prelim ] contains more definitions and various preliminary results .",
    "most of those results are not new , but many of them are not well - known in the quantum information theory community . in section [ results ] we state precise versions of our results and outline their proofs .",

    "this agrees with the usual linear algebra convention of representing linear maps as matrices .",
    "the relevant basis of @xmath40 is here @xmath41 , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath44 ( which can be identified with @xmath45 ) , and the @xmath46th  column \" of @xmath47 , i.e. , the @xmath5 matrix @xmath48 , is indeed @xmath49 .",
    "by appropriately reshuffling elements of @xmath50 we obtain another matricial representation of a quantum map , the dynamical matrix @xmath51 @xcite , sometimes also called in the literature  the choi matrix \" of @xmath52 .",
    "the dynamical matrix is obtained as follows @xmath53 an alternative ( and useful ) description of the dynamical matrix is as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , is a maximally entangled pure state on @xmath57 .",
    "we point out that the order of indices of the matrix @xmath58 in ( [ reshuff ] ) is different than in the previous work @xcite .",
    "( the reason for this change will be elucidated in the next paragraph . )",
    "note that in the present notation the operation of  reshuffling , \" which converts matrix @xmath12 into @xmath58 , corresponds to a  cyclic shift \" of the four indices .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to arrange the row and column indices of @xmath51 ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ) in the lexicographic order , thus obtaining a standard ",
    "flat \" @xmath61 matrix with a natural block structure : the leading indices @xmath62 indicate the position of the block and the second pair of indices @xmath63 refers to the position of the entry within a block . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath46th block of @xmath51 is @xmath64 or @xmath65 an @xmath5 block matrix with each block belonging to @xmath40 .",
    "if a super - operator @xmath12 belongs to the positive cone @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath12 is positivity - preserving ) , then it also maps hermitian matrices to hermitian matrices .",
    "this in turn is equivalent to @xmath12 commuting with complex conjugation @xmath66 ; in what follows we will generally consider only maps with this property .",
    "it is easy to check that hermiticity - preserving is equivalent to the following relation ( which has no obvious interpretation ) @xmath67 however , expressing condition ( [ symmetr ] ) in terms of the dynamical matrix we obtain @xmath68 which just means that @xmath69 is hermitian .",
    "thus one may describe linear hermiticity - preserving maps on @xmath40 via hermitian dynamical @xmath61 matrices .",
    "the property of being positive can be characterized just as elegantly .",
    "a theorem of jamiokowski @xcite states that a map @xmath12 is positive , @xmath70 , if and only if the corresponding dynamical matrix @xmath51 is _ block positive_. [ a ( square ) block matrix @xmath71 ( say , with @xmath72 for all @xmath73 ) is said to be block positive iff , for every sequence of complex scalars @xmath74 , the @xmath75 matrix @xmath76 is positive semi - definite . ]    arguably the most useful upshot of the dynamical matrix point of view arises in the study of cp maps .",
    "a theorem of choi @xcite states that a map @xmath12 is completely positive , @xmath77 , iff @xmath51 is positive semi - definite .",
    "therefore , to each cp map on @xmath40 corresponds an @xmath61 ( positive semi - definite ) matrix , and _",
    "vice versa_. in particular , the rescaled dynamical matrix @xmath58 associated with a ( non - zero ) cp map represents a state of a bi  partite system , @xmath78 ",
    "see e.g. @xcite , an element of the _ base _ of the positive semi - definite cone obtained by intersecting that cone with the hyperplane of trace one matrices .",
    "if the dimension of the cones or other sets under consideration is relevant , we will explicitly use a lower index , writing , e.g. , @xmath79 for the set of one  qubit completely positive maps .      the trace preserving property , tr@xmath80 ,",
    "is equivalent to a condition for the _ partial trace _ of the dynamical matrix @xmath81 therefore the compact set @xmath22 of quantum operations may be defined as a common part of the affine plane representing the condition ( [ tpcond ] ) and the cone of positive semi - definite dynamical matrices - see figure 1 in section [ prelim ] .    in ( [ tpcond ] ) and ( occasionally ) in what follows we use the labels @xmath82 to distinguish between the space on which the original state @xmath1 acts , namely @xmath83 , and the space of @xmath84 , denoted @xmath85 . in particular",
    ", @xmath86 stands for the identity operator on @xmath83 . since",
    "such conventions are somewhat arbitrary ( as was the ordering of indices of @xmath58 ) , some care needs to be exercised when comparing ( [ tpcond ] ) and similar formulae with other texts ( such as , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath87 . next ,",
    "let @xmath88 and let @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 is a cone , we will denote by @xmath91 the corresponding _ base _ of @xmath92 .",
    "( this definition makes good sense if @xmath93 or , equivalently , if the @xmath94 identity matrix @xmath95 belongs to the dual cone @xmath96 ( see ( [ dualconeofmaps ] ) ) . in this case the cones generated by @xmath97 and @xmath98 coincide , perhaps after passing to closures . )",
    "we will use the same notation for the sets of quantum maps corresponding to matrices via the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath99 belongs to @xmath100 iff @xmath101 .",
    "( here the identity matrix @xmath102 and its image @xmath103 are @xmath5 matrices , while @xmath51 is a @xmath94 matrix , with @xmath104 ; in particular the two trace operations take place in different dimensions . )",
    "then @xmath105 is a base of the cone @xmath19 , @xmath106 is a base of the cone @xmath20 , and similarly for other cones that will be introduced later .",
    "the ( real ) dimension of the bases is @xmath107 .",
    "the reason behind our somewhat non - standard normalization @xmath108 is twofold .",
    "first , the condition can be rewritten as @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a matrix whose hilbert - schmidt norm is equal to one ; this allows to treat @xmath111 as a distinguished element of cones and  at the same time  of their duals .",
    "next , the primary objects of our analysis are quantum _ maps _ , and the chosen normalization assures that tp ( and , dually , unital ; see appendix [ appe ] ) maps are in @xmath100 .",
    "when we are primarily interested in _ states _ , the normalization @xmath112 can be thought of as more natural ( the distinguished element @xmath113 is the then the maximally mixed state , usually denoted by @xmath114 ) .",
    "while all the matrix spaces or spaces of maps are _ a priori _ complex , all cones of interest will live in fact in the real space @xmath115 of hermitian matrices or in the space of hermicity - preserving maps .",
    "we will use the same symbols @xmath116 , @xmath100 etc . to denote the smaller _ real _ ( vector or affine ) subspaces ; this should not lead to misunderstanding .",
    "analogous point of view will be employed when studying other cones of quantum maps such as    @xmath117 the cone @xmath118 of _ superpositive _ maps ( also called _ entanglement breaking _",
    ", see ( [ dualitya ] ) and the paragraphs that follow )    @xmath117 the cone @xmath119 of _ decomposable _ maps ( see ( [ decompos ] ) )    @xmath117 the cone @xmath120 of maps which extended by identity impose positive partial transpose ( see ( [ conet ] ) and the paragraphs that follow ) .    in all cases we will identify the corresponding cone of @xmath61 matrices and will relate in various ways bases of the cones and their sections corresponding to the trace preserving restriction . for easy reference",

    "was recently found by a different method @xcite independently from the present work .",
    "finally , let us point out that formula ( [ explicit ] ) is valid only in the case when the underlying hilbert space is complex , and that our analysis focuses on the complex setting , as it is the one that is of immediate physical interest .",
    "however , all the discussion preceding ( [ explicit ] ) can be carried out also for real hilbert spaces , and virtually all results that follow do have real analogues .",

    "thus , for large @xmath0 , the latter set constitutes a very small part of the former one .",

    "should that be the case , the next step would be to carefully analyze the dependence of @xmath354 on @xmath0 given by the arguments presented in this paper .",
    "since the bases of cones , whose volume radii are described by theorem [ thm2 ] , are effectively homothetic images , with ratio @xmath0 , of the corresponding sets of trace one matrices ( see table 1 and the formulae that follow it ) , some of the inequalities / relations of theorem [ thm2 ] follow from known estimates for the volumes of various sets of states , particularly if we do not insist on obtaining  good \" numerical constants that are included in the statements .",

    "that discrepancy is also equal to the maximal ratio between @xmath485 over nonzero vectors @xmath486 .    in our case @xmath487 and @xmath488 . as a vector space , @xmath378",
    "may be identified with maps whose dynamical matrix has partial trace equal to @xmath208 .",
    "we will argue in the language of dynamical ( choi ) matrices considered as  flat \" block matrices . in these terms , membership in @xmath378 is equivalent to each block being of trace @xmath208 .",
    "we will choose as @xmath489 the block matrix whose @xmath490-th block is @xmath491 and the remaining blocks are 0 .",
    "further , we will choose as @xmath492 the matrix whose @xmath490-th block is @xmath493 and the remaining blocks are 0 ; then the scalar product corresponding to @xmath494 is @xmath495 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath496 is the @xmath490-th block of the choi matrix of any element of @xmath478 , then @xmath496 is a state and so the scalar product corresponding to @xmath497 is @xmath498 .",
    "accordingly , the discrepancy between the two maxima in ( [ nopolarity ] ) is at least @xmath499 .",
    "we want to determine the asymptotic order of the volume radius of the set of all completely postive , trace non increasing maps @xmath500 i.e. the set @xmath501 as pointed out earlier , an exact formula for that volume was very recently found ( independently from this work and by a different method ) in @xcite",
    ". however , an argument using the approach of this paper is conceptually very simple and so we include it .",
    "we have      to derive estimates on @xmath503 from the proposition , one needs to use the readily available information on the two factors in the denominator of the middle term of ( [ tni ] ) .",
    "first , the asymptotic order of the volume radius of @xmath478 was determined in theorem [ thm5](i ) .",
    "next , the set @xmath504 is a ball of radius @xmath505 ( in the operator norm ) centered at @xmath506 , and so its volume radius admits easy bounds given by the in- and outradius : @xmath505 and @xmath507 ( actually a much tighter lower bound @xmath508 can be obtained via a slight modification of the argument from theorem [ thm2](i ) , see appendix [ appa ] , but for our purposes the trivial bounds suffice ) .",
    "a straighforward calculation leads then to      the key point is that in order to calculate the volume radius we need to raise the volume to the power @xmath510 .",
    "thus the factors such as @xmath511 on the left hand side of ( [ tni ] ) are inconsequential since it leads to an expression of the form @xmath393 .",
    "for the same reason , the effects of @xmath512 and of the @xmath513-type factor , which also enters the calculation ( cf .",
    "proposition [ section ] and the comments following it ) , tend to 0 as @xmath341 .    for the proof of proposition [ prop6 ]",
    "we note first that @xmath514 is canonically isometric to the set of _ subunital _ maps @xmath515 in what follows we will work with the latter set .",
    "the isometry , which assigns to @xmath516 the dual ( in the linear algebra , or banach space sense ) map @xmath517 , sends @xmath478 to the set of _ unital _ maps @xmath518 the set @xmath519 admits a natural fibration : with every @xmath520 , we may associate @xmath521 in particular @xmath522 . in the language of choi ( dynamical ) matrices the equality from ( [ f_m ] ) translates to @xmath523 , or to @xmath524 if we think of @xmath51 as a block matrix @xmath525 . since all fibers @xmath526 are parallel to the subspace @xmath527 defined by @xmath528 ( or @xmath529 ) , one can express the volume as an integral @xmath530 the reason for the factor @xmath531 is that while the fibration is naturally parametrized by the elements of @xmath532 , the projection of @xmath526 onto @xmath533 is actually the map @xmath534 , whose choi matrix is @xmath535 ( or a block matrix whose all diagonal blocks are @xmath536 and off - diagonal blocks are 0 ) .",
    "now , the hilbert - schmidt norm of @xmath537 is @xmath538 , and so the projection of @xmath519 onto @xmath533 is isometric to @xmath539 .",
    "the second inequality in ( [ tni ] ) is now an immediate consequence of ( [ fubini ] ) and the bound @xmath540 , valid for all @xmath520 , which in turn follows , e.g. , from @xmath526 being the image of @xmath541 under the contraction @xmath542 .",
    "( on the level of dynamical matrices , the action of @xmath543 is given by @xmath544 or , in the language of block matrices , by @xmath545 . )",
    "the fact that @xmath546 is obvious from the definition ; surjectivity for invertible @xmath547 s follows by considering the inverse @xmath548 , and for singular @xmath547 s by looking at invertible approximants .    for the first inequality in ( [ tni ] ) we may use ( [ rs1 ] ) with @xmath549 and the section @xmath550 . as pointed out earlier",
    ", the set @xmath551 is then isometric to @xmath539 , and it remains to use the elementary bound @xmath552 .",
    "a alternative argument is to restrict the integration in ( [ fubini ] ) to @xmath553 , which is a ball in the operator norm of radius @xmath554 , then use the fact that for such @xmath547 the function @xmath555 is a contraction , and finally optimize over @xmath556 .",
    "this approach allows in fact to express the jacobian of @xmath543 in terms of eigenvalues of @xmath547 and , subsequently , to express the ratio under consideration as a multiple integral over @xmath557^n$ ] , but we will not pursue this path further .",
