    "accurate knowledge of the extinction law is crucial to most forms of observational astronomy .",
    "a detailed understanding of extinction in the infrared ( ir ) waveband , as it applies in differing environments , is especially important for the study of any heavily embedded object , from young stars to the cores of starburst galaxies and agn .",
    "the average extinction law in the diffuse interstellar medium is well defined in the near - ir and apparently shows little variation ( e.g.  mathis 1990 ) . however , the broad studies which produce this conclusion are based on low - extinction data ( e.g.  savage & mathis 1979 with @xmath3 ; cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 with @xmath4 ) .",
    "there is a little accurate information on how extinction curves might vary along lines of sight to heavily embedded objects .",
    "it is this latter question that we are investigating in this paper .",
    "there are many reasons to expect an altered extinction curve in regions of high gas density and at large a@xmath5 .",
    "average grain sizes are expected to be higher in sheltered molecular cloud environments than in the diffuse interstellar medium because of the processes of grain coagulation and the growth of icy mantles where a@xmath6 ( whittet et al .",
    "1983 , tielens 1989 ) .",
    "there is now plenty of evidence for significantly altered grain - size distributions and increased average grain sizes in dense molecular clouds and star - formation regions .",
    "such alterations cause variations in the extinction parameter @xmath7 and the wavelength of maximum polarisation by dichroic absorption where the extinction is higher ( savage & mathis 1979 , whittet et al .",
    "in general , the value of @xmath8 rises from the interstellar average of 3.1 to between 4 and 5 in dark clouds and regions of star formation .",
    "such a change indicates a flattening of the extinction curve at wavelengths shorter than 0.5@xmath0 m and is associated with alterations in the population of smaller dust grains ( e.g. cardelli & clayton 1991 ) .",
    "additional evidence for grain processing in dense regions comes from , e.g. , ir reflection nebulae associated with star formation , in the wavelength dependence of the scattered intensity ( castelaz et al .  1985 ) , the scattering optical depth ( yamashita et al .",
    "1989 ) and the shape of the 3.09@xmath0 m ice absorption feature ( pendleton , tielens & werner 1990 ) .",
    "all appear to be affected by the presence of significant numbers of large dust grains , and depletion of smaller grains may cause changes in the near - ir continuum extinction in low - mass ysos ( moore & emerson 1994 ) .    we have carried out observations of hydrogen recombination lines in a number of compact and ultracompact regions , and calculated the extinction law for these objects by comparing the line ratios with the predictions of well - established theoretical models ( hummer & storey 1995 ) . this method has been used previously by landini et al .",

    "the latter found that the g45.12 + 0.13 region displays an extinction law somewhat steeper than the standard curve .",

    "( 2002 ) that flatter near - ir extinction laws are found where higher extinction regions are present .    figure 5(a ) shows an apparently similar distribution of @xmath10 with 10@xmath49 m silicate - absorption optical depth obtained by fits to @xmath50 lrs data ( sr ) and to low - resolution ( @xmath51 ) spectroscopy ( faison et al.1998 ) .",

    "a least - squares fit gives a gradient of @xmath52 and intercept @xmath53 .",
    "the large scatter should not be too surprising , since there may be large uncertainties in @xmath14 in these low - resolution spectra , due to pah emission features on either side of it .",
    "there may also be silicate emission components filling in the absorption feature ( aitken 1996 ) and significant positional and beam - size discrepancies with our near - ir observations .",
    "figure 4 also shows that one target ( rcw57 ) has a low fitted value of @xmath10 without having a particularly high extinction .",
    "it should be noted , however , that there are large amounts of extended , structured emission ( e.g.  2mass k@xmath54 images ) in this target and that it contains a cluster of objects , some of which have localised high extinction ( e.g.  @xmath55 or @xmath56 , barbosa et al .",
    "2003 ) close by our observed position .",
    "there are two main potential causes of flatter observed extinction curves .",
    "one is unresolved optical depth structure , the other is a physical change in the dust grain properties , especially the size distribution , in the material around the source .",
    "these are discussed below .",
    "figure 6 shows the results of a simple two - component model to demonstrate the effects of extinction structure within the beam .",
    "three cases are shown in which the wavelength - dependence of the extinction is @xmath57 for both components , but where optical depths at 2.166@xmath0 m are in the ratios 1.0 , 3.0 and 10.0 .",
    "it can be seen that the apparent extinction curve becomes flatter with increasing contrast in the unresolved optical - depth structure , as well as departing from a single power law .",
    "single power - law fits to the latter two cases would produce exponents close to 1.5 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "the cause of this artificial flattening is the penetration of short - wavelength emission through the regions of low extinction .",
    "as mentioned above , at least one hii region with a low fitted @xmath10 value ( rcw57 ) is associated with large amounts of extended structure . however , there are two reasons to think that the effects of unresolved structure may not be the principal cause of the flatter extinction curves .",
    "the first comes from the model , which shows that the extinction contrast has to be large to produce curves as flat as some of those observed .",
    "secondly , we might expect that more distant sources have more unresolved structure and therefore tend to have flatter extinction curves , but we find no correlation between fitted @xmath10 values and source distance .",
    "we should , therefore examine the effect of variable dust - grain properties .",
    "a simple model of extinction by spherical grains with a size distribution similar to that deduced by mathis , rumpl and nordsieck ( 1977 ; mrn ) can be used to place rough contraints on the grain - size distribution in these regions .",
    "we have calculated the opacity of an equal - abundance mix of silicate and graphite grains using the mie scattering code bhmie by bohren & huffman ( 1983 ) and the optical constants used by weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) .",
    "we find that changes in the population of smaller grains , as manifested in a variable minimum grain radius @xmath58 to the mrn - like distribution ( @xmath59 ) , does not affect the slope of the near - ir extinction curve between 1@xmath0 m and 2@xmath0 m ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the shape of the curve is much more sensitive to the maximum grain radius @xmath60 and becomes flatter both when @xmath60 is small ( because the absence of larger grains means that absorption becomes a more important component of the extinction ) and when @xmath60 is large ( when scattering by the larger grains is no longer in the rayleigh regime ) .",
    "larger grains are the more likely case here , since there is other evidence of grain growth in star - formation regions ( see introduction ) .",
    "these simple models suggest that it is not easy to obtain a near - ir extinction law that is significantly steeper than the empirical power law ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) .",
    "a steeper slope would require a large proportion of weakly absorbing grains in the mix .",
    "thick mantles of pure water ice ( depth @xmath63@xmath0 m ) would have this effect , creating a steep extinction curve out to the edges of the strong 3.1-@xmath0 m feature ( ignoring the weak features at @xmath641.5@xmath0 m and @xmath642@xmath0 m ) .",
    "water ice exists toward one source in our list ( g35.20 - 1.74 , section 3.2 ) but , given that steep curves are not found , the mantles must be relatively thin ( significantly less than 0.1@xmath0 m thick ) .",
    "the model results also imply that reproduction of the standard extinction - law exponent , especially at wavelengths between 1@xmath0 m and 2@xmath0 m , requires values of @xmath60 to be between 0.1@xmath0 m and 0.3@xmath0 m ( fig .",
    "physically , this limit may arise from the balance between grain coagulation and destruction processes .",
    "departures from it are more likely where there is high line - of - sight extinction , but this is not the only variable ( local density and temperature should be involved ) .",
    "there was little effect on the model predictions from introducing increases in the silicate fraction , the addition of amorphous carbon or fluffy composite grains , or from changes in the slope of the size distribution .",
    "our results are quite consistent with the predictions of the model of krgel & siebenmorgen ( 1994 ) .",
    "these authors also predict no significant change of slope of the extinction curve between wavelengths of 1 and 2  for grains with a size distribution upper limit of 0.3 , applicable to dust in a dense molecular cloud .",
    "( see their figure 12 ) .",
    "an observable flattening of the extinction law is predicted by their models for grain distributions with upper limits @xmath65 0.3 . other studies that fit grain models to normal",
    "extinction also predict upper limits to the grain radius in a narrow range close to 0.2@xmath0 m ( e.g. weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "determinations of the extinction law between 1@xmath0 m and 2@xmath0 m have been made towards nine ultracompact hii regions with a@xmath66 , using hi line ratios .",
    "four objects have power - law fits @xmath61 with fitted values of @xmath10 more than 2@xmath11 lower than the average interstellar value of 1.8 .",
    "none of the targets shows a significantly steeper extinction law .",
    "there is an apparent trend for the sources with highest extinction to have flatter extinction curves but low values of @xmath10 are found at all extinctions .",
    "although unresolved clumpy extinction structure can cause apparent flattening of the extinction law , the observed shallow curves are likely to be due to changes in the dust properties .",
    "we will examine this trend further in paper ii where we study the extinction law from 25@xmath0 m in a sample of hii regions with average extinction higher than those presented here .",
    "a simple scattering model shows that changes to the maximum grain radius in high column density regions are the most likely cause and that the canonical @xmath67 exponent suggests that the maximum grain size is tightly constrained to be close to 0.2@xmath0 m .",
    "this upper limit must be the result of balance between grain destruction and coagulation processes .",
    "any significant change to the maximum grain radius due to a change in this balance will cause a flattening of the near - ir extinction curve .",
