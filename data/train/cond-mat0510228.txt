    "in recent years , the perovskite - related manganites have attracted tremendous interest , mainly triggered by the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) @xcite . but these systems , being governed by many competing interactions ( superexchange , double exchange , charge ordering , and jahn - teller effect ) leading to very rich phase diagrams , are also renowned for providing prototypical examples of temperature , doping , and magnetic - field induced metal - to - insulator ( mi ) transitions .",
    "the theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite investigation of the dynamical conductivity played a significant role in the clarification of the charge transport processes and the types of charge carriers in these manganites .",
    "however , still our understanding of the many puzzling properties of these materials is far from complete and the theoretical understanding of the importance of the electron - phonon coupling @xcite has to be verified in optical experiments .. in the present work , we report on the evolution of the dynamic conductivity of the classical cmr manganite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) when approaching the mi transition from the insulating side .",
    "both , dielectric measurements in the hz - ghz frequency range and optic measurements in the far- to near - infrared range were performed .",
    "they provide complementary information giving insight into the mechanisms that are active when the metallic state , hallmarked by a well pronounced drude contribution , develops out of the insulating one , characterized by strongly localized charge carriers .",
    "our results , together with those obtained on various other transition metal oxides , allow for the development of a general scenario for the evolution of the broadband dynamic conductivity when approaching the metallic state from the insulating side .",
    "[ phasediag ]    lamno@xmath2 is a charge - transfer insulator . in the octahedral environment",
    "the 3@xmath5-levels of the mn@xmath6 ions are split into a lower @xmath7 triplet and an excited @xmath8 doublet .",
    "the @xmath8 states are filled with one electron and hence are strongly jahn - teller active .",
    "indeed , below 800  k lamno@xmath2 exhibits orbital order with a half - filled lower and an empty excited @xmath8 level . on substituting la@xmath6 by sr@xmath9",
    ", holes are introduced into the lower @xmath8 level , weakening the jt interactions and driving the system into a metallic state @xcite .",
    "already in the early days it was speculated that for the metal - to - insulator transition double exchange might play an important role , driving the system from a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "the rich phase diagram of the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 system for low doping levels is given in figure [ phasediag ] , based on dc , magnetic , optic , and electron spin resonance measurements @xcite .",
    "depending on doping and temperature , the system exhibits a rhombohedral ( r ) and three different orthorhombic structures ( o , o@xmath10 , o@xmath11 ; see @xcite for details ) . at low concentrations ( @xmath12 )",
    "there is a jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted and insulating orthorhombic phase o@xmath10 , which at low temperatures reveals canted antiferromagnetism ( ca ) .",
    "the ground state is an orbitally ordered and ferromagnetic insulator ( fm / o@xmath11/i ) for @xmath13 , and a fm metal for @xmath14 in the non - jt distorted o and r phases ( diagonally hatched area ) .",
    "finally , the triangular region , marked `` gp '' , denotes the griffith phase , which was postulated in @xcite , based on electron spin resonance and magnetic measurements .",
    "the formation of this phase , which is characterized by ferromagnetic clusters formed below a characteristic temperature @xmath15 ( @xmath16  k in the present case ) , was ascribed to quenched disorder of the randomly distributed fm bonds in this material @xcite . at the fm phase boundary ,",
    "the clusters achieve fm order and percolate .",
    "well characterized single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , grown by the floating zone method , were kindly provided by profs .",
    "mukhin and a.m. balbashov @xcite .",
    "measurements of the dc conductivity were performed using a standard four - point technique . for the non - metallic samples , the ac conductivity at frequencies below 1",
    "ghz was recorded using an autobalance bridge hp4284 covering frequencies 20  hz  @xmath17 1  mhz and an hp4291 impedance analyzer at frequencies 1  mhz  @xmath17 1.8  ghz @xcite .",
    "the microwave conductivity was measured at 7.3 ghz utilizing a microwave perturbation technique within a @xmath18he - flow cryostat . in the ir regime",
    "the temperature - dependent conductivity was determined via reflectivity measurements using a bruker ifs 113v fourier transform spectrometer . from the reflectivity @xmath19 ,",
    "the conductivity @xmath20 was calculated via the kramers - kronig transformation , requiring an extrapolation of the data towards low and high frequencies . for @xmath21 ,",
    "a constant extrapolation was used for the insulating states and a hagen - rubens law for the metallic states . at high frequencies",
    "the spectra were extrapolated by a power law @xmath22 up to @xmath23  @xmath24 , leading to a smooth transition to the experimental data , which was followed by a @xmath25 power law at higher frequencies @xcite . for some samples , additional measurements at 7.3  ghz and around 100  ghz",
    "were performed using a microwave perturbation technique and a quasi - optic mach - zehnder spectrometer @xcite , respectively .",
    "in fig . [ refl ] the frequency dependent reflectivity of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 is shown for four doping levels up to @xmath26 .",
    "the sharp resonance features showing up in the region between 100 and 1000  @xmath24 ( 3  -  30  thz ) are due to phonon excitations .",
    "they are most prominent in the insulating regions of the phase diagram , i.e. for the low doping levels shown in figs .",
    "[ refl](a ) and ( b ) and for the higher temperatures at the higher doping levels given in figs .",
    "[ refl](c ) and ( d ) . for a detailed discussion of these phonon modes the reader",
    "is referred to references @xcite . for the insulating states , immediately following the last phonon mode the reflectivity increases sharply with increasing frequency .",
    "this can be ascribed to the onset of electronic excitations across a band gap , which at higher frequencies leads to a peak in the reflectivity close to @xmath27  @xmath24 ( @xmath28  ev ) . above about @xmath29",
    "@xmath24 , the onset of a further electronic excitation is observed for all doping levels shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from the electronic structure of the doped manganites that below @xmath27  @xmath24 excitations between and within the jt - split @xmath8 levels dominate .",
    "the charge - transfer gap , corresponding to a transition between the oxygen 2@xmath30- and the manganese @xmath8 states , is expected close to @xmath31 and is just covered at the high - frequency end of the reflectivity spectra for all compounds shown in fig .",
    "2 . for the metallic sample with @xmath26 [ fig . [ refl](d ) ] and when the metallic state is approached with decreasing temperature at for @xmath32 [ fig . [ refl](c ) ] , the gaplike excitations below @xmath27  @xmath24 and the phonon modes are superimposed by a strong additional contribution , smoothly increasing and finally tending to saturate with decreasing frequency .",
    "these are the characteristic features of a drude contribution due to free charge carriers .",
    "[ refl ]    to gain deeper insight into the various processes contributing to the infrared reflectivity and to relate the results to those obtained at sub - ghz frequencies , it is helpful to calculate the frequency dependent conductivity from the reflectivity using the kramers - kronig transformation . figure [ x0 ] shows the frequency dependence of @xmath20 of pure lamno@xmath2 at selected temperatures , combining results at low frequencies @xcite and in the infrared region @xcite .",
    "only those parts of the spectra are shown that are not affected by contact contributions @xcite , which were shown in @xcite to dominate at very low frequencies and high temperatures . as already noted in @xcite , for @xmath33  ghz ,",
    "three contributions can be identified : for @xmath34 , @xmath35 approaches the frequency - independent dc conductivity .",
    "its temperature dependence follows the prediction of the variable - range - hopping model @xcite . with increasing frequency",
    ", @xmath35 increases smoothly , which can be parameterized by a sublinear power law @xmath36 with @xmath37 @xcite , a behavior termed `` universal dielectric response '' ( udr ) due to its universal occurrence in a variety of materials @xcite . such a behavior",
    "is commonly regarded as a hallmark feature of hopping conduction of charge carriers subjected to disorder - induced localization @xcite .",
    "superimposed to this power law , a shoulder shows up at low temperatures . as revealed by the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ x0 ] , it corresponds to well - pronounced peaks in the dielectric loss @xmath38 shifting through the frequency window with temperature .",
    "this is typical for a relaxational process , which was ascribed to localized hopping of polarons in @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the energy barrier of 86  mev , determined from the temperature dependence of the relaxation time @xcite , obviously has no relation to the energy scales of the polaronic excitations observed in the infrared region , which are discussed below .",
    "[ x0 ]    it is not possible to extrapolate the sublinear power law found below ghz towards the infrared results in the thz regime , even if assuming @xmath39 as indicated by the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "clearly an additional contribution must be present in the so - far uninvestigated intermediate region .",
    "we propose that there is an additional superlinear power law ( slpl ) , @xmath40 , with @xmath41 as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "such a slpl was clearly detected , e.g. , in the cmr manganite pr@xmath42(ca@xmath43sr@xmath44)@xmath45mno@xmath2 @xcite and evidenced to be a universal feature of disordered matter @xcite , e.g. supercooled liquids or doped semiconductors . in the present case of a nominally undoped material without any substitutional disorder , a slight off - stoichiometry or impurities at the ppm level seem to be sufficient to produce this typical response of disordered matter , as it is also the case , e.g. , for latio@xmath2 @xcite .    in the infrared region , at frequencies beyond the phonon resonances a peak shows up at about 380  thz , corresponding to 1.6  ev .",
    "as shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ x0 ] , its peak frequency is nearly independent of temperature .",
    "this peak most probably corresponds to an electronic transition between the jt - split @xmath8 bands .",
    "the excitation from one @xmath8 orbital to another at the same site is forbidden and should have negligible oscillator strength .",
    "hence , this peak structure must correspond to a transition between mn - ions on adjacent sites , which , due to hund s coupling , is favorable for parallel spin alignment .",
    "thus , at first glance at the magnetic phase transition an anomaly in the intensity is expected , but experimentally only a moderate temperature dependence is observed ( lower inset of fig . [ x0 ] ) .",
    "this finding may be explained considering that in the paramagnetic phase the spins are thermally disordered while in the type - a antiferromagnetic state , order is established with ferromagnetic spin alignment within and antiferromagnetic order between the ( @xmath46,@xmath47)-planes .",
    "but the above interpretation is not corroborated by polarized light - scattering experiments , which indicate a strong charge - transfer character of this transition @xcite .",
    "further experiments will be necessary to unravel the nature of this transition .",
    "[ x125 ]    in fig .",
    "[ x125 ] , reproduced from ref .",
    "@xcite , the frequency - dependent conductivity of la@xmath48sr@xmath49mno@xmath2 is shown for three temperatures . at room temperature , where the dc conductivity is rather high ,",
    "the low - frequency measurements provide information on the intrinsic conductivity in a restricted frequency range only , because at low frequencies the contact contributions and at high frequencies the inductance of the sample dominates @xcite . nevertheless , from fig .",
    "[ x125 ] it seems clear that in the sub - ghz range the room - temperature conductivity is frequency independent . however , interpolating from ghz to the lowest frequencies of the fir experiment , thereby taking into account the single point at 7.3  ghz from a microwave resonance measurement , it seems likely that in this region a small increase of @xmath50 is present .",
    "it can be suspected to be caused by hopping conduction of localized charge carriers , the corresponding sublinear power law emerging from the dc background with increasing frequency .",
    "the presence of this contribution , pointing to a localization of the charge carriers also in this compound , becomes even more obvious at the lower temperatures , where a succession of a clearly pronounced sublinear power law and a slpl can be suspected .",
    "the non - metallic character of this compound is further corroborated by the complete absence of a drude contribution in the infrared region . instead , above the phonon modes",
    ", the conductivity exhibits a strong increase , which can be ascribed to superposed contributions from polaron absorption and interband transitions , as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "[ xhigh ]    for sr contents @xmath32 and 0.2 , having ferromagnetic metallic ground states , the measured low - frequency conductivity is dominated by inductance and skin effect contributions @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath50 can be expected to reveal a significant frequency dependence only at high frequencies , in the infrared and optical region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ xhigh ] . for @xmath32 , at high temperatures , where the sample is close to the mi transition ( cf .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) , @xmath50 shows a broad peak at about @xmath27  @xmath24 . with decreasing temperature ,",
    "spectral weight is shifted from this excitation towards lower frequencies , leading to a peak or shoulder strongly shifting towards lower frequencies when the sample becomes more metallic with decreasing temperature .",
    "finally , at 6  k @xmath35 increases markedly towards low frequencies , in good accord with the strongly enhanced dc conductivity , thus exhibiting the clear signature of a drude contribution of free charge carriers .",
    "a detailed analysis of the drude response in la@xmath51sr@xmath52mno@xmath2 was provided in @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the excitation at about 11000  @xmath24 or 1.4  ev has a similar origin as that at 1.6  ev for pure lamno@xmath2 .",
    "but now we have a fraction of mn@xmath53 sites with no @xmath8 electrons .",
    "hence , in addition to transitions between jt - split @xmath8 orbitals , optical transitions between empty and occupied @xmath8 levels have to be taken into account .",
    "we believe that the broad peak at room temperature at 1.4  ev is a mixture of both processes . with decreasing temperatures",
    "a remainder of the jt - split derived peak still is visible at 1.4  ev , indicating the significantly weaker jt energy in the doped crystals compared to the 1.6  ev observed in the pure compound ( fig .",
    "the second spectral feature branching off from this excitation and being strongly temperature dependent can be ascribed to a polaronic excitation .",
    "similar behavior has been reported in @xcite exemplifying the importance of strong electron - phonon interactions in the manganites .",
    "the strong softening of this polaronic excitation qualitatively resembles the behaviour predicted by millis @xcite for a scenario of strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "however , in the case of half - filling , the polaronic excitation transforms into a drude type behavior at low temperatures . in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( @xmath4 )",
    "a drude peak evolves with doping simultaneously with the polaronic excitation , with the drude peak being characterized by a low relaxation rate and a very low optical weight .",
    "the rather symmetric shape of the polaron peak with the absence of a clear cut - off frequency at low frequencies indicates the dominance of small polarons @xcite .",
    "finally , at the high - frequency edge of the investigated spectral range , a further strong increase of the conductivity shows up , indicating the onset of the charge - transfer excitation as in pure lamno@xmath2 . for @xmath26 [ fig . [ xhigh](b ) ] , the overall behavior is qualitatively similar to that observed for @xmath32 .",
    "however , the excitation ascribed to the polaronic transition seems to be shifted to lower energy , now located at about 0.8  ev at room temperature and of significantly lower optical weight . at the lowest temperatures a narrow drude peak dominates the optical conductivity and",
    "the polaronic excitation appears as a weak shoulder close to 3000  @xmath24 .",
    "[ fits ]    in fig .",
    "[ fits ] , a least - square fit of the conductivity of la@xmath51sr@xmath52mno@xmath2 measured at 6  k is shown ( dashed line ) . for the fit , the sum of a drude term dominating at low frequencies and a lorentz term ( peak frequency @xmath54 , damping constant @xmath55 ) taking into account the polaronic excitation was used .",
    "the three phonon modes were neglected .",
    "a good description of the experimental data could be achieved in this way , revealing a drude relaxation time of @xmath56s . using a fermi velocity for the orthorhombic structure of @xmath57  cm / s @xcite",
    ", we obtain a mean free path of 4  nm , which characterizes this compound as a bad metal . as discussed earlier , the symmetric form of the polaron absorption points towards the existence of small polarons @xcite . the small ratio of the optical weight of the drude conductivity to that of the polaron absorption ( fig .",
    "[ fits ] ) indicates that only a small fraction of free charge carriers contributes to the drude - like conductivity , while the majority still is localized by strong electron - phonon coupling effects .",
    "the ac conductivity of the cmr manganite la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 was reported for four doping levels @xmath58 .",
    "the combination of low - frequency and optical measurements revealed the importance of hopping conduction of localized charge carriers for the non - metallic parts of the phase diagram of this system . in the infrared region beyond the phonon modes , evidence for two electronic modes were obtained , one of them showing the clear signature of a polaronic excitation .",
    "deep in the metallic state a strong drude contribution is observed .",
    "taking together the results of the present work and those obtained on a variety of further transition metal oxides and other systems being close to a mi transition @xcite , allows for the development of a general scenario for the broadband ac conductivity when approaching the mi transition from the insulating side . as schematically indicated in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] , deep in the insulating phase most materials show a succession of a dc plateau , a sublinear , and a superlinear power law @xcite .",
    "such a behavior seems to be closely connected to hopping conduction of charge carriers that are localized due to disorder .",
    "one should note , however , that this notion is mainly based on theories that were developed for amorphous or heavily doped conventional semiconductors @xcite and whose predictions can be approximated by a sublinear power law .",
    "it is not clear , if these theories also should be applicable to electronically correlated materials as , e.g. , the cmr manganites .",
    "also so far there is no well - founded explanation for the slpl , which seems to occur concomitantly with the sublinear law . whatsoever",
    ", it seems clear now that in the insulating and semiconducting states these power laws are also active in the only rarely investigated transition region between the classical dielectric frequencies ( @xmath59 below ghz ) and those of typical infrared experiments .",
    "often they even seem to represent the background for the phonon modes , however , vanishing abruptly beyond the highest phonon resonance . when the system further approaches the metallic state , the dc conductivity , growing more rapidly than the udr and the nearly constant slpl , dominates over an increasingly broader frequency range , which finally extends well up to the first phonon modes ( second curve from above in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] ) .",
    "this typically occurs for a dc conductivity of about 100  -  1000  @xmath60@xmath24 and marks the transition into the metallic state . up to this point ,",
    "the infrared response is dominated by strong phonon modes , followed by electronic excitations due to interband and polaronic contributions . within the metallic phase ,",
    "the phonons and low - lying electronic modes are successively superimposed by the typical free carrier drude behavior as indicated by the uppermost curve in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "it is interesting that the value of @xmath35 marking the transition from insulating to a drude - like metallic behavior seems to be rather universal and a connection of this finding to the concept of the `` minimum metallic conductivity '' proposed by mott @xcite may be suspected .",
