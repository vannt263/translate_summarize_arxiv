    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) is now essentially established  @xcite .",
    "the most convincing evidence for dm came from the observation that luminous objects such as stars , gas clouds , globular clusters , or entire galaxies move faster than one would expect if they only felt the gravitational attraction of other visible objects  @xcite .",
    "dm is estimated to constitute about 23  @xmath5 of the total matter in the universe .",
    "however , the origin of dm still remains a mystery .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics explains experimental results , but none of the sm particles can be a good candidate for the dark matter .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to look for new physics beyond the sm . in the literature",
    "there are various proposals as dark matter candidates , being a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) a promising candidate ; in fact , the wimp relic density is around the observed value ( planck collaboration )  @xcite :    @xmath6    [ eq : omega ] in supersymmetric models , one candidate is the lightest neutralino as a spin-1/2 wimp dark matter  @xcite .",
    "spin-1 wimp dark matter has been studied in the context of models with extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "some extensions of the sm include one or more gauge singlet scalars  @xcite ; if these scalars are stable , they can in principle account for a density of dm .",
    "several new physics scenarios with extended scalar fields and extra higgs doublets have been considered to accommodate new particles as dm candidates .",
    "for example , in the inert two higgs doublet model ( idm )  @xcite , where a dm candidate coming from the higgs doublet is considered , and its mass has been constrained to the order of gev  @xcite . recently a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) with a @xmath7 gauge symmetry , including a gauge boson @xmath8 with mass of order of gev scale or below , has been proposed , that is the case of the d2hdm  @xcite .    in the d2hdm a continuous symmetry @xmath7 is the mechanism to keep very suppressed the yukawa couplings between fermions and scalars , while in the idm this is achieved by imposing a @xmath9 discrete symmetry . in this work we consider the framework of the d2hdm in order to propose a wimp - like dm candidate particle .    in section [ sec : mod ]",
    "we will introduce the d2hdm , in section [ sec : dm ] we discuss the relic density contribution of a singlet scalar dm particle , and finally in section [ sec : res ] we discuss the phenomenological limits obtained from cosmological data to the parameter space of the model .",
    "in this section we will briefly introduce the field content and the parameters used later .",
    "we will follow closely the notation introduced by lee and sher  @xcite .",
    "the gauge group of the d2hdm is the sm group extended with the @xmath0 group , @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling associated to @xmath0 will be denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "a mixing among the kinetic energy terms for the gauge fields , @xmath12 and @xmath0 , is allowed given the gauge invariance in @xmath13 .",
    "this mixing term is parametrized by the weak mixing angle @xmath14 and a new parameter denoted by @xmath15 .",
    "the kinetic terms are written explicitly as @xmath16 where , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the field strength tensors of the @xmath19 and @xmath0 gauge bosons , respectively .",
    "the gauge field of @xmath20 is redefined by the rotation @xmath21 and therefore the mixing term in equation ( [ eq : kin ] ) is cancelled .",
    "the mixing parameter @xmath15 will appear in all terms where @xmath20 is redefined .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath15 has been constrained to @xmath22 @xcite .    in the d2hdm",
    "the scalar field content is given in the two doublets and one singlet defined as follows    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 , with @xmath29  gev .",
    "the charges and representations for the scalar fields under the symmetry group @xmath13 can be written in compact form as follows @xmath30 where the quantum numbers are in the following order @xmath31 .",
    "the interactions between the scalar and gauge bosons are given by @xmath32 where the covariant derivative @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 after the right spontaneous symmetry breaking ssb , additionally to the mass terms we will have the mixing term @xmath35 .",
    "this new mixing term is proportional to @xmath36 , and the @xmath20 mass is @xmath37 in order to cancel the mixing term the following rotation is required @xmath38 where the mixing angle @xmath39 satisfy the expression @xmath40 , and has been constrained to @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the most general potential for the scalar sector is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 we note that all parameters in the potential are real parameters .",
    "complex parameter could arise from terms like @xmath46 or @xmath47 , we do not have this kind of terms because they are forbidden by the @xmath48 gauge symmetry .",
    "the mass squared matrices for the higgs and singlet fields are @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52",
    "once the mass matrices are diagonalized , the higgs bosons masses are found to be @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 the mixing angle @xmath57 is constrained by @xmath58 the potential @xmath59 will be neglected in order to avoid interactions between the scalar doublets and the singlet .",
    "note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not appear in the mass matrix , even if @xmath59 is included , this is due to the minimum condition for the potential .    in the usual 2hdm ,",
    "the pseudoscalar mass @xmath62 is proportional to the parameter @xmath63 associated to the @xmath64 term . in the d2hdm ,",
    "@xmath65 in order to keep the @xmath48 gauge invariance , which means that initially the pseudoscalar does not acquire mass through the usual potential .",
    "the @xmath63 coupling can be generated by introducing the interaction of the form @xmath66 between the doublets and the singlet  @xcite , however this issue is beyond the scope of our work and will not be taken into account .",
    "in d2hdm the two doublet scalars @xmath67 have interactions with fermions , therefore none of them could be proposed as dark matter candidates .",
    "however the singlet scalar @xmath68 has no yukawa interactions , playing the role of inert particle in the d2hdm .",
    "we assume that dm particles were initially in thermal equilibrium with the early universe .",
    "after the temperature of the universe goes down , below the dm particle mass scale , the expansion rate overtakes the annihilation rate for the dm particle . in other words",
    "the density number is no longer affected by interactions and remains constant .",
    "this is the so called freeze out mechanism .",
    "the density of a specific particle at the time of freeze out is known as the relic density for this particle  @xcite .",
    "the dark matter abundance can be obtained by solving the boltzmann equation for the number density rate .",
    "the boltzmann equation can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dm number density and @xmath71 is a scale factor .",
    "the species - independent equilibrium number density is defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the degeneracy of the scalar dm .",
    "all information about the model interactions is contained in the thermally averaged cross section , defined as @xmath74 in fig .",
    "( [ fig:02 ] ) are shown the annihilation channels contributing to the total amplitude in the model .",
    "the total average amplitude @xmath75 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 , \\label{eq : zz}\\ ] ] @xmath78 , \\label{eq : zz'}\\ ] ] @xmath79 , \\label{eq : z'z'}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the mandelstam variable for the squared center of mass energy . from the equations above",
    ", it can be noticed that the amplitud @xmath81 gives the biggest contribution to the total amplitude due to the strong dependence in the mixing parameter @xmath82 .",
    "interactions derived from @xmath68 are under control by the condition @xmath83 , being @xmath84 any gauge neutral boson in the model . under these assumptions the scalar particle associated to the @xmath68 singlet",
    "is proposed as a dm candidate .",
    "in previous sections was stablished the motivation to propose @xmath68 as a dm candidate . in the following",
    "we will show how the model parameters can be strongly constrained by taking into account the latest measurements of relic density .    in order to compute the relic density for our dark matter particle ,",
    "given different values of the parameters in the model , the boltzmann equation was solved numerically using micromegas  @xcite .",
    "the squared matrix elements for the new physics model file were generated through lanhep  @xcite , implementing the code in order to include the d2hdm .",
    "the charged and neutral higgs masses are used to evaluate the @xmath85 parameters that appear in the potential , equation ( [ v1 ] ) .",
    "the case under study is that of a neutral higgs lighter than the one observed by atlas and cms collaborations  @xcite . for our calculations the heavier neutral higgs mass",
    "is fixed to @xmath86 gev and the mass of the smaller higgs varies in a range below that value .",
    "the case of a neutral higgs , with mass lighter than @xmath87  gev , implies that given the smallness of its branching ratio it can not be observed in collision experiments , this is the case of the so called invisible higgs  @xcite .",
    "the mixing angles of the model @xmath57 and @xmath88 are fixed by the mass region for the invisible higgs . both are phenomenologically constrained by data of the invisible higgs dacay to fermions from lep  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig:00 ] ) is depicted the allowed region for the mass of the scalar dm particle , @xmath89 , and the mass of the light @xmath8 , @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig:01 ] ) it is shown @xmath90 as a function of @xmath2 . in both cases the narrow region",
    "is bounded by the value of the relic density in the range of the measured value @xmath91",
    "the mass of the invisible higgs @xmath92 in all figures is set to @xmath93  gev , and for different values in the range @xmath94 $ ]  gev , there is no significant difference in the results .",
    "the allowed values obtained depend on a specific assignment of @xmath4 .    from fig .",
    "( [ fig:00 ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig:01 ] ) can be extracted the following limits , for @xmath95 , the restrictions found are @xmath96 $ ]  gev and @xmath97 $ ]  gev . and for @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 $ ]  gev , and @xmath100 $ ]  gev . also for @xmath25",
    "we have , @xmath101 $ ]  gev when @xmath95 , and @xmath102 $ ]  gev when @xmath98 .",
    "the d2hdm includes a scalar spectrum originated from the two doublets and singlet , @xmath103 .",
    "the doublet participation in the yukawa couplings is under control via the @xmath0 gauge invariance , while the mixing angles @xmath57 and @xmath88 are under control by the assumption of the invisible higgs .",
    "the singlet scalar can be a plausible wimp - like dm candidate due to its lack of participation in the yukawa couplings .    from the amplitudes obtained for the processes @xmath104 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zz])-([eq : zz ] ) , one can notice that the mixing parameters of the model also contribute in the constraining of the allowed values of the vector boson and scalar particle masses @xmath3 and @xmath89 .",
    "we find that the d2hdm provides a plausible dm particle candidate .",
    "the masses of the scalar particle @xmath89 and the extra boson @xmath3 , can be restricted using the latest measurements of relic density from microwave background radiation .",
    "the model under study is a feasible one with a testable parameter space that could be further restricted using future data .",
