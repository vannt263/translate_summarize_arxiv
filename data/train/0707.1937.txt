    "initially , calculations of stellar orbits in galaxies ignored the dark matter halo completely . then , as observational evidence for dark matter halos increased @xcite , orbit calculations involved modelling the halos as stationary spherical objects .",
    "further investigation into dark matter halos indicated that many halos were in fact triaxial @xcite and not spherical .",
    "this was taken into consideration in , for example , @xcite but orbits were still modelled within stationary dark matter halos and these calculations fail to take into account the effect of figure rotation .",
    "@xcite suggest that figure rotation of the dark halo would play an important role in the formation and evolution of the embedded galaxies . in particular , they suggest that figure rotation may influence the formation of stellar bars as well as spiral arms and warps .",
    "they also suggest that figure rotation could trigger star - bursts in galaxies , even at high redshifts .",
    "since orbits passing near the centre of galaxies are affected , figure rotation could also have consequences for black hole growth in galaxies @xcite and the so - called ` cusp / core problem ' @xcite .",
    "observations of such effects could be used to constrain current galaxy formation theories .",
    "+ initial work on the subject of figure rotation was done by dubinski in 1992 .",
    "he found that halos in simulations which included tidal effects experienced a noticeable rotation .",
    "the halos were found to have pattern speeds ranging from 0.1 to 1.6 radians per gyr .",
    "( these units are essentially equivalent to km s@xmath4 kpc@xmath4 ) . the small sample size and somewhat artificial implementation of the tidal field ,",
    "meant further studies in this area were necessary .",
    "@xcite , noticed that a significant number of triaxial halos produced in cold dark matter simulations tended to rotate steadily around their minor axes .",
    "one such halo was extracted from the simulation at late times and was allowed to evolve in isolation over a 5 gyr period . during this time the halo was found to rotate as a solid body with constant speed of about 1.1 radians per gyr . in 1999 , @xcite proposed that slow figure rotation of a surrounding triaxial dark halo may be responsible for creating the spiral structure seen in ngc 2915 and encouraged further studies of gas disks contained within the potentials of rotating triaxial dark halos .",
    "@xcite continued this work , using numerical simulations .",
    "they showed that a ` slowly ' rotating triaxial dark halo could cause large spiral arms in an extended gas disk , and that the resulting structure is strongly dependent on the pattern speed of the halo . @xcite",
    "further explored the effects of a rotating triaxial dark halo proposed by @xcite , using hydrodynamical simulations and concluded that , while a rotating triaxial halo could be responsible for causing spiral structure , the required pattern speed was prohibitively large - between 5.5 and 6.5 radians per gyr .",
    "more recently , bailin and steinmetz ( 2004 , hereafter bs04 ) compared the orientation of the major axis determined from the central sphere ( radius of 0.6 @xmath5 virial radius ) of 317 halos selected from a high resolution simulation over five time intervals ( a total period of just over 1gyr ) .",
    "they found that 278 ( 88 per cent ) of their halos did indeed rotate smoothly , with pattern speeds of around 0.15 @xmath3 ( where h@xmath6 = 100 @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) radians per gyr .",
    "they noted that the pattern speeds observed in the inner regions of the undisturbed halos in their sample were not sufficient to cause the spiral patterns as discussed by @xcite .",
    "we note that the simulations of @xcite are 2-d and the code used was usually applied to disks around stars .",
    "when one considers the 3-d simulations of @xcite , in their figure 2f , some spiral structure is evident after 1gyr for much smaller pattern speeds than those considered by @xcite .",
    "the slowest figure rotation in @xcite is 0.77 kms@xmath4kpc@xmath4 , which is significantly larger than typical values found in bs04 , but it is unclear what would be expected in galaxies with slower pattern speeds over much longer periods of time . here",
    "we extend the analysis of bs04 to investigate whether one would expect coherent figure rotation over periods much longer than the 1gyr period they used .",
    "we have simulated the evolution of structure in a ( 50 @xmath3@xmath4 mpc)@xmath7 region of space , in a @xmath0cdm cosmology , using the n - body code gadget @xcite to evolve the positions and velocities of 256@xmath7 collisionless particles .",
    "halos are identified from the simulation using a friends - of - friends algorithm . to explore figure rotation ,",
    "we have identified halos from simulation outputs at a redshift of zero and then traced them back through time .",
    "we then determine the principal axes of each halo using the inertia tensor . by following the motion of the principal axes of each halo over several time steps , we are able to measure the pattern speed of the halo .",
    "our approach is similar to that of bs04 but we extend their analysis to test some of their assumptions .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in section 2 , the simulations and analysis procedure are described . in section 3 , we present the results of the analysis : the mass function , the spin parameter distribution , the outcome of halo tracing and the accretion constraints applied , the outcome of substructure elimination , the environment of halos selected for study , the figure rotation measurements , the alignment between rotation axis and the minor axis and , finally , the correlation between the pattern speed and halo properties such as halo mass . in section 4 , we discuss the results .",
    "we assume the standard model for structure formation : that density fluctuations are gaussian and the initial power spectrum is given by a power law , p@xmath8 k@xmath9 , where n @xmath10 1 . as the universe moves from a radiation - dominated to a matter - dominated phase and",
    "fluctuations begin to grow , the power spectrum becomes modified in a way that depends on the density of dark matter .",
    "@xcite give the transfer function t ( where p(k ) = p@xmath11(k ) t ) for a universe that is dominated by cold dark matter .",
    "the normalisation of the spectrum can be obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background or from the measured abundance of clusters of galaxies . to set initial particle positions and velocities",
    ", we used the cosmics package @xcite with @xmath12=0.3 , @xmath13=0.7 and @xmath14=0.9 .",
    "+      we ran the publicly available parallel version of gadget on a cluster of eight 2 gbyte machines .",
    "doing so allowed us to follow the evolution of @xmath15 particles .",
    "we have chosen to simulate a cube of length 50 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "this is sufficiently large to produce reliable periodic simulations @xcite .",
    "the choice of particle number and volume mean that in this simulation each dark matter particle has a mass of @xmath16 10@xmath17 . guided by studies of @xcite",
    "we have used a force softening of 30 @xmath1 kpc to prevent numerical instability .",
    "the parameters chosen for our simulation are summarised in table [ sparams ] .",
    "+    .[sparams]simulation parameters [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      @xcite used a computationally intensive bootstrapping technique to show that the error in the determination of a halo s principal axes depends on the number of particles contained within that halo and the intrinsic shape of the halo .",
    "they also showed that it was not possible to measure the principal axes of halos with the precision required for figure rotation measurements if the halos contained fewer than 4000 particles .",
    "guided by their work , we identified the 222 halos in our simulation at a redshift of zero , which contain at least 4000 particles ( that is , a mass of at least @xmath18 ) .",
    "bs04 also showed that errors are large for halos which are almost oblate but this only affects a small number of halos in our case .",
    "we are able to trace 218 , 201 , 191 halos over the 1 , 3 , 5 @xmath1 gyr periods respectively .    after imposing constraints on the acceptable amount of accretion over the time period considered , as discussed in [ mergertrees ] ,",
    "we are left with samples of 183 , 62 and 13 halos over the 1 , 3 , 5 @xmath1 gyr periods respectively .",
    "when we use the relaxed 5 @xmath1 gyr constraints , ie . impose a constraint at each timestep , rather than a constraint over the entire period , we obtain 74 halos over 5 @xmath1 gyr",
    "+ we are concerned with the figure rotation of undisturbed halos and , therefore , needed to eliminate all halos exhibiting a significant amount of substructure .",
    "identifying substructure is somewhat subjective and we compared various methods . the first method involved projecting the distribution of particles along three perpendicular axes and considering each axis individually .",
    "we expect the mass distribution of an undisturbed halo to be smooth when considered along any axis and the presence of a secondary peak in this distribution thus provides evidence of substructure .",
    "we calculated the mass contained in bins moving out from the centre of the halo , where the centre is defined as the most bound particle . if any bin contained more mass than an inner bin we compared the mass of that bin to the total mass of the halo .",
    "after visually inspecting the distributions , and some experimentation , we chose to use 25 bins and eliminate halos if an outer bin contained more than 10 per cent of the total halo mass . applying this to our sample of halos over a period of 1 @xmath1gyr , we eliminated 68 halos on the basis of substructure . 24 and 8 halos needed to be excluded from the sample over the 3 and 5 @xmath1gyr periods respectively . for our larger 5 @xmath1 gyr sample , where we constrain common particles between successive timesteps , 26 of the 74 halos need to be eliminated .",
    "we also tried using the method of @xcite .",
    "their method involves excluding halos if the calculated pattern speed varies significantly when one changes the size of the sphere used to define a halo .",
    "the bs04 method only considers particles within the central sphere of the halo and substructure outside of this will not cause a halo to be eliminated . using this approach we found that 94 , 7 and 1 of the 183 , 62 and 13 halos we considered would have been eliminated . for the relaxed constraint over 5 @xmath1gyr , 4 of the 74 halos",
    "need to be eliminated .",
    "we note that our method was generally more conservative over longer time periods ( over the 5 @xmath1gyr period we rejected 35 per cent of halos while 5 per cent would have been eliminated using their method ) but there were a few halos that would have been excluded using their method and were not excluded using ours .",
    "cc     +    in order to explore the environment of our halos , we have considered the mass density of the area surrounding the halos at z=0 .",
    "to do this we have , for each halo , found the number of particles within 5 @xmath1 mpc of the halo .",
    "the sum of the surrounding mass is then divided by the volume of a sphere with radius of 5 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ massdens ] where we plot the fraction of halos as a function of the log of their mass density .",
    "the top figure shows the distribution of mass density of all the halos identified from the simulation , while the bottom histogram shows the distribution of our sample of undisturbed halos .",
    "while we lose a few of the most massive halos in our selection , the undisturbed halos appear to occur in an environment which is slightly more dense than average .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite who found that , for z @xmath19 1 , the merger rate of cluster halos to be 3 times lower than that of isolated halos and twice as low as halos that end up in groups . with this in mind",
    ", we expect that undisturbed halos would occur in a more dense environment .      to determine the pattern speed of a halo , we have followed each halo over a period of 5 @xmath1gyr ( or 1 or 3 @xmath1gyr if the halo does not satisfy selection criteria over longer periods ) . using linear regression",
    ", we have found the best - fitting linear relation for the figure rotation of the halos as a function of time .",
    "the pattern speed of the halo is given by the slope of the linear fit .",
    "we have calculated the one - sigma limit of the slope , and we have taken this to be the error in the pattern speed .",
    "figure [ patternspeed3gyr ] shows the figure rotation of one of our halos that has remained unaffected by substructure over a 5 @xmath1gyr period .",
    "results are similar for other halos .",
    "a linear fit is adequate over the whole period and there is no indication that the pattern speeds are systematically changing over time .",
    "c +    figure [ error_z7 ] shows the pattern speeds obtained for our halos .",
    "the 115 halos observed over 1 @xmath1gyr are shown in the top plot , the middle plot shows the 38 halos observed over 3 @xmath1gyr , the bottom plot shows the halos considered to be undisturbed over 5 @xmath1gyr period using relaxed accretion constraints ( boxed crosses mark the pattern speeds and errors of the 5 halos that meet the stricter accretion criteria similar to that used in the top and middle plots and in bs04 ) .",
    "the x - axis is the estimated error in pattern speeds .",
    "the dashed line represents the points at which the observed pattern speed is equal to the estimated error .",
    "we have also shown the points at which the pattern speed is equal to twice the estimated error ( dotted line ) . using a 2@xmath20 cutoff for halos to be considered rotating coherently , 63 per cent of the halos in the 1 @xmath1gyr sample , 71 per cent of the halos in the 3 @xmath1gyr and 100(73 ) per cent of the halos in the 5 @xmath1gyr(relaxed ) sample exhibit coherent figure rotation .",

    "best - fitting values to this curve are given in table 2 .",
    "for the undisturbed halos over 5 @xmath1gyr the fastest figure rotation detected was 0.13 @xmath3 radians per gyr and the average pattern speed of these halos was 0.09 @xmath3 radians per gyr .",
    "the maximum figure rotation for the halos with relaxed contraints over 5 @xmath1 is 0.24 @xmath3 radians per gyr . adjusting our cutoff to include only those halos with pattern speeds greater than three times the error , does not significantly change the pattern speed distribution .",

    "it appears that these axes are well - aligned for at least a third of the halos .",
    "we note , however , that the fraction of halos exhibiting this alignment is smaller than in other studies . if we consider only the spherical centre of the halos , the percentage of halos exhibiting this alignment increases to @xmath10 50 per cent which is more consistent with the 58 per cent found by @xcite . using a modified inertia tensor also slightly increases the fraction of halos found to be rotating around the minor axis .",

    "we plot results in figure [ patternspeedvshalo ] , demonstrating that pattern speed is not correlated with any of these halo properties .",
    "the final plot demonstrates that our results are not sensitive to the the accretion cut values we use .",
    "+ we have found that the mass function determined from our simulation is well fit by the mass function obtained by @xcite using n - body simulations .",

    "this agrees well with the values found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of these tests suggest that the simulations we have run are reliable , agreeing with many previous simulations as well as with theoretical predictions .",
    "we selected halos which had not accreted a large fraction of their material and which did not show evidence for significant substructure and found that 63 per cent of the 115 halos considered over 1 @xmath1gyr did exhibit coherent figure rotation , where ` coherent ' is arbitrarily defined to be pattern speeds greater than two times the estimated error .",
    "the distribution of the pattern speeds over 1 @xmath1gyr was well - fit by a log - normal distribution centred at log@xmath23 ( @xmath2 = 0.24 @xmath3 radians per gyr ) .",
    "the pattern speeds of these halos , determined over a 1 @xmath1gyr period , are consistent with the lower end of the 0.1 - 1.6 radians per gyr found by @xcite , but slower than the 1.1 radians per gyr detected by @xcite .",
    "our distribution of pattern speeds peaks at slightly higher values than those found by @xcite , but the difference is not very significant .",
    "it appears that limiting oneself to the central sphere of a group and using a modified inertia tensor do not significantly influence the results .",
    "the accretion cut and the substructure cut affect the number of halos considered , but the pattern speed distributions are not very sensitive to the details .",

    "this result holds no matter what halo definition , accretion cut or method of substructure removal is used .",
    "presumably , studying the halos over a longer time period allows us to detect smaller figure rotations above the noise but , over 5 @xmath1gyr , there are no halos with the larger figure rotations seen over 1 @xmath1gyr , suggesting that accretion and/or mergers allow for increased pattern speeds . in general , the speeds found are much slower than those @xcite claim are required for spiral structure in ngc2915 but , given the long periods of time over which these halos show coherent figure rotation and the results of @xcite , we suggest that further hydro - simulations would be required before strong conclusions can be drawn for all galaxies .",

    "the two axes are within 25@xmath24 of each other in 30 per cent of the halos , using the `` whole - group '' definition of a halo . if we restricted our analysis to the central region and used the modified inertia tensor , as did @xcite , our results are more similar to theirs .",
