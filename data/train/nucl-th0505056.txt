    "recent experiments had provided clear evidence of the existence of many low lying @xmath3 bands in deformed nuclei . using a q3d spectrometer in high - precision ( p , t ) studies 13 excited @xmath1 states",
    "have been identified below 3.1 mev in @xmath0gd , seven of them for the first time @xcite .",
    "the new @xmath1 assignments were strengthened by the placement of @xmath4 rays that were identified to belong to the @xmath0gd nucleus with no previous level assignments .",
    "such an abundance of @xmath1 states had not previously been seen in nuclei .",
    "this high density of @xmath1 states challenges the simplest theoretical descriptions , which usually predict very few bands below 3 mev .",
    "this is true for the earlier studies using the geometrical collective model ( gcm ) @xcite , and the _ sd-_ibm @xcite , which could account for only 5 excited @xmath1 states below 3 mev .",
    "the inclusion of the octupole degree of freedom in iba calculations allows the prediction of 10 excited @xmath1 states below 3 mev and 14 below 4 mev , a number of them having a strong collective two - phonon octupole character @xcite .",
    "the projected shell model ( psm ) @xcite , using as building blocks angular - momentum - projected two- and four- quasiparticle ( qp ) states , is also able to reproduce reasonably well the energies of all observed @xmath1 states @xcite .",
    "most of the states are dominated by one 2-qp or 4-qp state , coming from the near - fermi nilsson levels with low excitation energies .",
    "the qp nature of these excited states is quite different from the collective octupole vibration introduced in @xcite .    a microscopic calculation within the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite offered a less biased criterion for determining the nature of these @xmath1 states .",
    "in this model the microscopic phonons , both collective and noncollective , are generated in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , and are used to diagonalize a separable hamiltonian containing different multipoles .",
    "the study of the @xmath1 states in @xmath0gd found many low energy states , which in most cases have large , if not dominant , two - phonon octupole components @xcite , in agreement with the previous iba predictions @xcite .",
    "measured electromagnetic transition strengths are extremely useful to distinguish between different theoretical models . a strong",
    "@xmath5 had been determined in @xmath0gd using the grid technique @xcite.the authors associated this with band mixing rather than with a double-@xmath4 phonon .",
    "other @xmath6 values for the decay of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands were also reported in @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath1 excitations with the @xmath9 reaction allowed the determination of @xmath10 values for ten of the previously measured excited @xmath1 states @xcite .",
    "they all have values between one and a few w.u . , suggesting the presence of a significant fragmentation of the collectivity in these excited states .",
    "@xmath11    .",
    "the theoretical description of these large but fragmented b(e2 ) values has not been possible up to now . from the 18 @xmath1 states predicted in the psm to have energies below 3.25 mev @xcite , only two states",
    "have b(e2 ) transition strengths larger than 1 w.u . in the qpm calculation only the first excited @xmath1 state is predicted to decay with a @xmath6 strength larger than 1 w.u ..    in the present contribution we report on an attempt to describe the observed @xmath1 excited states and their @xmath6 transition strengths in @xmath0gd using the pseudo su(3 ) model @xcite .",
    "we were strongly motivated by the success of this model in describing the energy levels and electromagnetic transition strengths in many excited bands in @xmath12gd , @xmath13dy and @xmath14tm @xcite .",
    "the same model allowed also the description of up to 8 rotational bands in @xmath15dy @xcite . in",
    "what follows we will briefly review the main ideas behind the pseudo su(3 ) model , present the results for @xmath0gd , and discuss them critically .",
    "the pseudo su(3 ) model @xcite has been widely used in recent years in the description of even - even @xcite and odd - mass nuclei @xcite .",
    "the first step in any application of the pseudo su(3 ) model is to build the many - body basis . for the pseudo su(3 )",
    "scheme the proton and neutron valence nilsson single - particle levels are filled from below for a fixed deformation , which in the case of @xmath0gd is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it allows the determination of the most probable normal and unique parity orbital occupancies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ occup ] .",
    "= 9.00 cm    of the 14 valence protons , 8 occupy normal parity orbitals , and 6 intruder orbitals . of the 12 valence neutrons ,",
    "8 are in normal parity orbitals and 4 in intruder orbitals .",
    "many - particle states are built as pseudo - su(3 ) coupled states with a well - defined particle number ( of nucleons in normal parity orbits ) and good total angular momentum .",
    "nucleons occupying the intruder orbits are considered implicitly through the use of effective charges .",
    "the explicit inclusion of the unique - parity sector configurations remains an open challenge that , while under investigation , is still not available .",
    "since in a quadrupole - quadrupole driven hamiltonian , the states corresponding to highest deformation are the most important , we extract from this scheme the proton and neutron su(3 ) irreps corresponding to the highest @xmath17 values which , in turn , are coupled to final su(3 ) irreps that have good total angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the configuration space was generated from the strong coupling of the eight protons and eight neutrons in the normal parity states .",
    "two sets of calculations were performed . in the first case proton and neutron states with only pseudo - spin zero were considered and , in the second case , the configuration space was enlarged by considering proton and neutron states with both pseudo - spin zero and one . in both cases the configuration space was truncated by considering all the coupled su(3 ) irreps with a @xmath17 greater than the same value for the @xmath18 .",
    "the su(3 ) irreps considered in the two cases are given in table [ gd158_irreps ] , and [ gd158g_irreps ] .",
    ".case 1 : the su(3 ) irreps ( obtained by coupling all the pseudo - spin zero proton and neutron irreps ) with @xmath19 , ordered by decreasing @xmath17 values , used to describe the low - energy spectra in @xmath0gd . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in both cases the transition strengths to the ground state band are two or more orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental ones .",
    "there are , however , three or four b(e2 ) values to the @xmath4- bandhead larger than 1 w.u .",
    "this suggests that , while many @xmath1 states are described in the pseudo su(3 ) model at the right excitation energy , their wave functions are missing some important elements .",
    "the mixing of different occupancies in the normal parity sector , induced by the pairing interactions @xcite , could correct for these deficiencies .",
    "the excitation energies of many @xmath1 states in @xmath0gd can be properly described using the pseudo su(3 ) model including states with pseudo - spin 0 , 1 and 2 . while the calculated b(e2 )",
    "transition strengths to the g.s .",
    "band are smaller than the observed ones , those to the gamma band are of the same order , measured in w.u .. calculations in @xmath20gd suggest that configuration mixing ( different normal and intruder occupations mixed by pairing ) could allow stronger transitions to the g.s . band .",
