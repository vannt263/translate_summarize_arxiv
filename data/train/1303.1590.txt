    "in the gravitational instability scenario galaxies acquire their angular momentum via tidal torque produced by a misalignment between the inertia tensor of the proto - halo and the embedding gravitational shear tensor generated by the surrounding matter distribution .",
    "this is the so called tidal torque theory ( ttt ) @xcite . although the ttt predicts a correlation between the spin orientation of galaxies and their local large scale structure observations of spin alignments have been so far inconclusive and often contradictory ( @xcite among others ) .",
    "the reason is still not clear and may include the intrinsic difficulties in deducing the spin vector of galaxies , small galaxy samples , challenges in characterizing lss from galaxy redshift catalogues , etc .    on the theoretical / numerical front",
    "the picture is more clear . to date",
    "there is a consensus that the spin vector of haloes in walls lies in the plane of their host walls while haloes in filaments have their spin either parallel or perpendicular to their host filament depending on their mass @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the spin alignment of haloes in filaments is the existence of a transition mass m@xmath0 , at which haloes change their orientation from parallel to perpendicular .",
    "this effect was first reported by @xcite and later confirmed by other authors @xcite .",
    "the spin alignment of low - mass haloes also has a redshift dependence starting perpendicular and becoming parallel at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this common primordial orientation and subsequent change indicates an additional mechanism for angular momentum acquisition that has a stronger effect in low - mass haloes . in the observational front",
    "the two regimes of alignment / anti - alignment of low - mass and high - mass haloes in filaments have been recently observed by @xcite if one assumes a correlation between hubble type and galaxy / halo mass .",
    "they found that bright spirals have a weak tendency to have their spin parallel to their host filaments while elliptical / s0 show a strong perpendicular alignment .",
    "the existence of a hierarchy of structures in the cosmic web in which large structures contain and are defined by smaller ones ( @xcite among others ) begs the question of whether the halo alignment reflects this hierarchy .",
    "the limited number of studies that link the alignment signal and the hierarchy of cosmic structures indicate that the transition mass of alignment in filaments depends on the scale of the filament @xcite and the distance from the halo to the closest cluster @xcite .",
    "however , to date no direct link has been stablished between halo alignment and the hierarchy of cosmic structures .",
    "the ttt theory does not provide a mechanism ( at least a simple one ) to produce the observed two - regime alignment of haloes with their mass or to change the alignment of haloes from perpendicular to parallel with time .",
    "recently an alternative mechanism for angular momentum acquisition has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite in which angular momentum is generated by the anisotropic infall of matter .",
    "this is in term defined by the surrounding lss morphology and dynamics , offering a natural process for spin - lss correlations .",
    "this secondary - torque mechanism may help explain the change in alignment and possibly even contribute to the primordial torque generation .",
    "in order to study the effect of environment in the alignment of haloes in filaments and walls we need to characterize the density field according to its local geometry , compute its local direction and , for the problem at hand , its _ hierarchical relations_. the identification of filaments and walls was performed using a significantly improved implementation of the multiscale morphology filter ( mmf , @xcite ) .",
    "the mmf-2 performs the identification of structures on a generalization of scale - space : the hierarchical - space , which exposes the _ hierarchical character _ of the density field in contrast to the scale - space approach ( as in the original mmf and its derived implementations @xcite ) which emphasize the _ scale _ of the structures and is insensitive to their nesting relations .",
    "the hierarchical space used in the mmf describes both scale and nesting relations .",
    "we generate the hierarchical space as described in @xcite and @xcite , by gaussian - smoothing the _ initial conditions _ instead of the _ final _ density field as in the scale - space approach .",
    "this _ linear - regime smoothing _ is applied when all fourier modes are independent , allowing us to target specific scales in the density field before fourier mode - mixing occurs .",
    "the smooth initial conditions evolve by gravity producing all the anisotropic features of the cosmic web but lacking of small - scale structures including dense haloes ( below the smoothing scale ) .",
    "this reduces the dynamic range in the density field and greatly limits the contamination produced by dense haloes in the identification of filaments and walls .",
    "the identification of structures in the original mmf method and the one presented here is done based on the second - order local variations of the density field encoded in the hessian matrix .",
    "lss morphologies are associated to ratios between the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix ( @xmath2 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the output of the mmf-2 is a set of  masks \" sampled on a regular grid indicating which voxels belong to a given morphology at a given hierarchical level . for our purposes we generated a filament , sub - filament wall and sub - wall masks ( f@xmath3 , f@xmath4 , w@xmath3 and w@xmath4 respectively",
    ", the subscript indicates the hierarchical level ) .",
    "these masks roughly correspond to the  feature maps \" @xmath5 in the original mmf algorithm .",
    "a complete description of the mmf-2 method will be presented in aragon - calvo ( 2013 ) in preparation .",
    "the n - body simulations and related halo catalogues used in this work are based on the mip correlated ensemble simulation . @xcite .",
    "the mip simulation consists of 220 realizations sharing identical lss fluctuations defined at @xmath6 where @xmath7 corresponds to a scale of 4 mpc h@xmath8 . at smaller scales ( @xmath9 )",
    "realizations can be considered independent between each other .",
    "each realization in the ensemble contains @xmath10 dark matter particles inside a box of 32 mpc h@xmath8 of side with cosmological parameters @xmath11 .      for the purpose of this paper we generated a two - level hierarchical space defined by linear - regime smoothing scales of @xmath12 and @xmath13 mpc h@xmath8 delineating the prominent structures in the cosmic web and their substructure respectively .",
    "we denote these hierarchical levels as lev-1 ( filaments / walls ) and lev-2 ( sub - filaments / sub - walls ) . from the template initial conditions",
    "used to generate the mip ensemble ( see @xcite for details ) we generated low - resolution @xmath14 initial conditions grids and smoothed them at the scales defined above .",
    "we then evolved the particles to the present time @xmath15 using the pm - tree code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "these simulation were used only to compute density fields .      from the particle distribution we computed densities following the technique presented in @xcite and @xcite . in this",
    "novel approach particles define lagrangian volumes that reflect the changes in density as particles evolve deforming the original volume .",
    "lagrangian volumes are defined by 8 adjacent particles forming a  cube \" that is divided into 6 tetrahedra .",
    "we estimate densities in the tessellation as the mean density of the adjacent tetrahedra to each vertex and interpolated to a regular grid taking care to account for multistreams .",
    "this method makes density estimation computationally straightforward , it produces a continuous volume - filling density field with practically no artifacts in low and medium - density regions ( our regions of interest ) and is self - adaptive by construction .",
    "haloes were identified in each realization of the mip ensemble using the friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we imposed a count limit of 50 particles corresponding to a halo mass of @xmath17 m@xmath18 h@xmath8 .",
    "we use the mip ensemble in  stack mode \" , where halo catalogues from all realizations are aggregated into one  master halo catalogue \" .",
    "the full mip stacked ensemble contains @xmath19 haloes inside a volume of ( 32 mpc h@xmath8)@xmath20 giving unprecedented halo number density . for each fof group",
    ", we compute its mass , center of mass , mean velocity etc .",
    "the angular momentum was computed as :    @xmath21    where the sum is over all the particles in the halo , @xmath22 is the particle mass , @xmath23 is the distance to each particle from the center of the halo , @xmath24 is the peculiar velocity of the particle and @xmath25 the mean velocity of the halo with respect to its center of mass .",
    "the angle between the spin of the halo and its host filament or wall was computed as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the angles between the spin of the halo and the direction of its host filament ( @xmath30 corresponding to the direction of constant density along the filament s axis ) or the normal to the wall ( @xmath31 corresponding to the direction of maximum change in the density field ) .",
    "figure [ fig : density_hierarchical ] shows the density field at @xmath15 from the two hierarchical levels defined by 4 and 2 mpc h@xmath8 linear - regime smoothing ( lev-1 and lev-2 respectively ) and the original initial conditions with no smoothing ( top panels from left to right ) . the original density field enclosed in the filament and sub - filament mask",
    "is shown at the bottom - left and center panels .",
    "the two - level hierarchy of filaments ( the union of the two sets ) is shown in the bottom - right panel . in order to clearly differentiate between the alignment signal of haloes in filaments and sub - filaments we  cleaned \" the sub - filament mask by removing the sub - filaments embedded inside filaments .",
    "we also constrained sub - filaments to be contained by walls .",
    "this removes the tenuous intra - void filaments . the mask of ",
    "clean \" sub - filaments is then defined as :    @xmath32    where f@xmath4 is the sub - filament mask , w@xmath3 is the wall mask and f@xmath33 is the complement of the filament mask . in",
    "what follows f@xmath3 and f@xmath34 denote the masks we used to compute spin - alignment of haloes in filaments and sub - filaments respectively",
    "our main findings are shown in figure [ fig : mean_cos_theta ] where we measure the mean cosine of the angle between the spin vector of haloes and the direction of their host filament / sub - filament ( left panel ) or wall / sub - wall ( right panel ) as a function of halo mass .",
    "a more detailed view of the spin alignment distribution for haloes in filaments / sub - filaments is shown in figure [ fig : halo_spin_distribution ] .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * haloes in filaments and sub - filaments present a two - regime spin alignment as a function of their mass : low - mass haloes are ( in average ) aligned parallel to their parent filament while high - mass haloes are oriented perpendicular to it , confirming previous findings . *",
    "the mean alignment of low - mass haloes seems to converge at @xmath35 down to a halo mass of @xmath36 m@xmath18 h@xmath8 in both filaments and sub - filaments . *",
    "the alignment of high - mass haloes does not seem to converge like in the case of the low - mass haloes .",
    "instead , the alignment signal increases with increasing mass .",
    "* we found a significant difference in the transition mass m@xmath0 dividing parallel and perpendicular alignment for haloes in filaments and sub - filaments being m@xmath37 m@xmath18 h@xmath8 and m@xmath38 m@xmath18 h@xmath8 respectively . *",
    "the slope in the alignment - mass curve of high - mass haloes in sub - filaments is more pronounced than in the case of haloes in filaments .",
    "* haloes in walls / sub - walls have their spin oriented in the plane of the wall for the full range of masses in our halo sample ( @xmath39 m@xmath18 h@xmath8 ) . * while the spin alignment distribution of haloes in filaments and sub - filaments seem scaled versions of each other ( see figure [ fig : halo_spin_distribution ] ) the spin alignment distribution of low - mass haloes is practically the same for filaments and sub - filaments even though their transition masses are different by a factor of 3 .",
    "using an advanced lss classification algorithm ( mmf-2 ) and a novel n - body correlated ensemble simulation we were able to measure the halo spin alignment signal with unprecedented detail in a variety of cosmic environments .",
    "our results confirm previous findings while significantly improving the alignment signal detection .",
    "however , we found a difference in the transition mass m@xmath0 at which the spin alignment changes from being parallel ( low - mass haloes ) to perpendicular ( high - mass haloes ) depending on the hierarchical level of the host filament .",
    "this hierarchy - dependent effect has not been observed before due to the inability to explicitly target the nesting relations of the structures in the cosmic web .",
    "we found that haloes in walls have their spine aligned with the plane of the wall independently of the halo s mass .",
    "the explicit link between halo spin alignment and cosmic web hierarchy was possible with the use of the mmf-2 method ( introduced here ) that identifies cosmic structures and their hierarchical relations and benefits from an improved density estimation algorithm .",
    "the use of the mip simulation allowed us to perform a high - resolution analysis of the density field over a relatively small volume while at the same time providing us with the large number of haloes needed to detect the spin alignment signal .",
    "the change of alignment of haloes in filaments , the dependence of the transition mass with redshift @xcite and filament hierarchy ( this work ) indicates a ",
    "secondary torque \" process that acts cumulatively and affects all haloes but manifest itself first in low - mass haloes . since tidal torque is mostly efficient before turnaround the process changing the spin orientation of haloes must be of a different nature .",
    "the anisotropic infall scenario offers a tantalizing alternative .",
    "walls and sub - walls accrete mass from their adjacent voids in the direction parallel to the normal of the wall inducing angular momentum on the plane of the wall so haloes retain their primordial spin alignment . on the other hand filaments and sub - filaments accrete mass mainly from their adjacent walls in the direction perpendicular to the filament thus inducing a parallel spin alignment .",
    "low mass haloes are more affected because their low - mass makes then prone to have their spin direction changed for a given mass accretion rate compared to high - mass haloes . the stronger perpendicular alignment of haloes in sub - filaments in comparison to haloes in filaments reflects the more quiet environment characteristic of walls and their embedded sub - filaments .",
