    "in describing the phenomenology of ageing system , we shall refer throughout to simple ferromagnets , see @xcite for reviews .",
    "we consider systems which undergo a second - order equilibrium phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath1 and we shall assume throughout that the dynamics admits no macroscopic conservation law . initially , the system is prepared in some initial state ( typically one considers an initial temperature @xmath2 ) .",
    "the system is brought out of equilibrium by quenching it to a final temperature @xmath3 . then @xmath4 is fixed and the system s temporal evolution is studied .",
    "it turns out that the relaxation back to global equilibrium is very slow ( e.g. algebraic in time ) with a formally infinite relaxation time for _ all _ @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the time- and space - dependent order parameter and consider the two - time correlation and ( linear ) response functions @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the magnetic field conjugate to @xmath8 and space - translation invariance was already implicitly assumed .",
    "the autocorrelation and autoreponse functions are given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is referred to as _ observation time _ and",
    "@xmath12 is called the _ waiting time_.     glauber - ising model , with temperature @xmath13 on a @xmath14 lattice and a disordered initial state.,title=\"fig : \" ]   glauber - ising model , with temperature @xmath13 on a @xmath14 lattice and a disordered initial state.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure  [ abb1 ] we show the autocorrelator @xmath15 of the @xmath16 kinetic ising model with glauber dynamics after a quench to the final temperature @xmath17 . in the left panel , the dependence of @xmath15 on the time difference @xmath18 is shown . clearly , the autocorrelator depends on both @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for large values of @xmath12 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the values of @xmath15 reach a quasistationary value @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the equilibrium magnetization . in the regime @xmath22 one",
    "observes an algebraic decay of @xmath15 .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviour is known from glassy systems and the simultaneous dependence of @xmath15 and/or @xmath23 on _ both _ @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the formal definition of _ ageing behaviour_. the strong dependence of @xmath15 on the waiting time ( which expresses the sensibility of the system s properties on its entire history ) seems at first sight to lead to irreproducible data and hence to prevent a theoretical understanding of the ageing phenomenon .",
    "remarkably , struik @xcite observed in polymeric glasses submitted to mechanical stress that the linear responses of quite distinct materials could be mapped onto a single and _ universal _ master curve .",
    "we illustrate this here in the ferromagnetic glauber - ising model through the data collapse in the right panel of figure  [ abb1 ] .",
    "remarkably , a dynamical scaling holds although the equilibrium state need not be scale - invariant .    on a more microscopic level , correlated domains of a linear size @xmath24 form",
    "these are ordered if @xmath25 but do contain internal long - range fluctuations at criticality . in the first case , the system undergoes _ phase - ordering kinetics _ and in the second _ non - equilibrium critical dynamics_. for sufficiently large times , the domain size scales with time as @xmath26 where @xmath0 is the dynamical exponent .",
    "the slow relaxation to global equilibrium ( although local equilibrium is rapidly achieved ) comes about since for @xmath27 there are at least two distinct and competing equilibrium states .",
    "these states merge at @xmath28 . on each site @xmath29 the local environment selects the local equilibrium state .",
    "as suggested from figure  [ abb1 ] , one expects a scaling regime to occur when @xmath30 where @xmath31 is some ` microscopic ' time scale .",
    "we shall see later how important the third condition in ( [ 1:agereg ] ) is .",
    "if the conditions ( [ 1:agereg ] ) hold , one expects @xcite",

    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the autocorrelation @xcite and autoresponse @xcite exponents , respectively .",
    "they are independent of the equilibrium exponents and of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it was taken for granted since a long time that @xmath34 but examples to the contrary have recently been found for spatial long - range correlations in the initial data @xcite and in the random - phase sine - gordon model @xcite . if @xmath2 , the inequality @xmath35 holds @xcite .",
    ".values of the non - equilibrium exponents @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath0 for non - conserved ferromagnets with @xmath1 .",
    "the non - trivial critical - point value @xmath38 is model - dependent.[tab1 ] [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     after these preparations , we can now present numerical monte carlo ( mc ) data and compare them with the predictions ( [ 2:autor],[2:rtsr ] ) .",
    "we consider the thermoremanent magnetization @xmath39 and subtract off the leading finite - time correction according to ( [ 3:rho ] ) . for @xmath25",
    "this leads to the parameter values collected in table  [ tab2 ] , see @xcite for details .",
    "then the mc data both _ at _ @xmath28 and for @xmath25 for @xmath39 are in full agreement with ( [ 3:rho ] ) @xcite , in both @xmath16 and @xmath40 . here",
    "we present a direct test of galiliei - invariance by considering the space - time integrated response @xmath41 with an explicitly known expression for @xmath42 following from ( [ 2:rtsr ] ) and the leading finite - time correction is already subtracted off @xcite . since all non - universal parameters were determined before and are listed in table  [ tab2 ] , this comparison between simulation and local scale - invariance is parameter - free .",

    "after @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this direct evidence in favour of galilei - invariance in the phase - ordering kinetics of the glauber - ising model is all the more remarkable since the zero - temperature time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation ( tdgl ) , which is usually thought to describe the same system ( e.g. @xcite ) , does not have this symmetry .",
    "indeed a recent second - order result for @xmath23 does not agree with ( [ 2:autor ] ) @xcite ( similar corrections also arise at @xmath28 @xcite ) . on the other hand , @xmath43 from the exact solution of the @xmath44 glauber - ising model at @xmath45 @xcite , while @xmath46 in the @xmath44 tdgl @xcite , implying that these two models belong to distinct universality classes .",
    "confirmations of ( [ 2:autor],[2:rtsr ] ) in exactly solvable models are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "we now wish to review the present state of theoretical arguments @xcite in order to understand from where the recent numerical evidence in favour of a larger dynamical symmetry than mere scale - invariance in ageing phenomena might come from .",
    "we shall do this here for phase - ordering kinetics .",
    "then @xmath47 and we have to consider the schrdinger group and schrdinger - invariant systems . for simplicity , we often set @xmath48 . from the following discussion ,",
    "the importance of galilei - invariance will become clear , see also ( [ 2:galinv ] ) .",
    "* a ) * consider the free schrdinger equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is fixed . while an element of the schrdinger group acts projectively ( i.e. up to a known companion function @xcite ) on the wave function @xmath8 , we can go over to a true representation by treating @xmath51 as an additional variable .",
    "following @xcite , we define a new coordinate @xmath52 and a new wave function @xmath53 by @xmath54 we denote time @xmath11 as the zeroth coordinate and @xmath52 as coordinate number @xmath55 .",
    "we inquire about the maximal kinematic group in this case @xcite .",
    "now , the projective phase factors can be absorbed into certain translations of the variable @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the free schrdinger equation becomes @xmath56 in order to find the maximal kinematic symmetry of this equation , we recall that the three - dimensional klein - gordon equation @xmath57 has the @xmath40 conformal algebra @xmath58 as maximal kinematic symmetry . by making the following change of variables @xmath59 and setting @xmath60",
    ", the @xmath40 klein - gordon equation reduces to ( [ henkel : gl3 - 18 ] ) .",
    "therefore , for variable masses @xmath51 , the maximal kinematic symmetry algebra of the free schrdinger equation in @xmath61 dimensions is isomorphic to the conformal algebra @xmath62 and we have the inclusion of the complexified lie algebras @xmath63 @xcite .    * b ) * the galilei - invariance of the free schrdinger equation requires the existence of a formal ` complex conjugate ' @xmath64 of the order parameter @xmath8 . on the other hand , a common starting point in the description of ageing phenomena",
    "is a langevin equation which may be turned into a field theory using the martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) formalism @xcite and which involves besides @xmath8 the response field @xmath65 .",
    "if we identify @xmath66 and use ( [ henkel : gl3 - 17 ] ) together with the assumption that @xmath53 is real to define the complex conjugate , then the causality condition that @xmath67 vanishes for @xmath68 , follows naturally ( and similarly for three - point response functions ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculation of response and of correlation functions from a dynamical symmetry should be done in the same way .    * c )",
    "* so far , we have concentrated exclusively in applications of local scale - invariance to finding the form of response functions while the determination of correlation functions was not yet adressed .",
    "we shall do so now and consider the langevin equation ( with @xmath69 ) @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the usual ginzburg - landau functional , @xmath72 is a time - dependent lagrange multiplier which will be chosen to produce the constraint @xmath73 and @xmath74 is an uncorrelated gaussian noise describing the coupling to a heat bath such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "another source of noise comes from the initial conditions and we shall always use an uncorrelated initial state such that @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant .        and we used ( [ 4:aini ] ) , see @xcite . here",
    "@xmath80 describes the noiseless part of the action while the thermal and the initial noise are contained in @xmath81 .",
    "finally , the potential @xmath72 can be absorbed into a gauge transformation ; for example if @xmath82 is a solution of the free schrdinger equation , then @xmath83 solves the schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath72 and where @xmath84 the realization of the schrdinger algebra with @xmath85 is easily found @xcite .",
    "we now assume in addition to dynamical scaling that @xmath71 is such that _ at temperature @xmath45 , the theory is galilei - invariant _ @xcite .",
    "this looks physically reasonable and we now explore some consequences of this hypothesis .",
    "we denote by @xmath86 an average carried out using only the noiseless part @xmath80 of the action .",
    "the bargman superselection rules state that @xmath87 if @xmath88 .",
    "first , the response function is @xmath89\\right)\\right\\rangle_0   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left\\langle\\phi(t,\\vec{r}){\\widetilde{\\phi}}(s,\\vec{0})\\right\\rangle_0 = :   r_0(t , s;\\vec{r } ) \\label{4:r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last line the exponential was expanded and the bargman superselection rule was used . here",
    "@xmath90 is the noiseless response and the form ( [ 2:autor],[2:rtsr ] ) of schrdinger - invariance is recovered if @xmath91 @xcite . in other words , under the stated hypothesis , the response function is independent of the noises .",
    "this is certainly in agreement with the explicit model calculations reviewed in section  3 .",
    "second , we now obtain the autocorrelation function . as before @xcite",
    "@xmath92\\right)\\right\\rangle_0   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & dt\\int\\!\\d u\\d\\vec{r}\\ , r_0^{(3)}(t , s , u;\\vec{r } ) + \\frac{a_0}{2 } \\int\\!\\d\\vec{r}\\ , r_0^{(3)}(t , s,0;\\vec{r})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 .",
    "in contrast with the response function , the autocorrelation function contains _ only _ noisy terms and in fact vanishes in the absence of noise . by hypothesis",
    ", schrdinger - invariance holds for the noiseless theory and the three - point function @xmath94 is fixed up to a scaling function of a single variable @xcite .    working out the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath15 for @xmath95 according to ( [ 1:c ] ) and comparing with the response function ( [ 4:r ] )",
    ", we find that _ for any coarsening system with a disordered initial state ( [ 4:aini ] ) and whose noiseless part is schrdinger - invariant , the relation @xmath34 holds true _ @xcite . for the first time a general sufficient criterion for this exponent relation is found .    the autocorrelator scaling function becomes for phase - ordering @xmath96 but the scaling function @xmath97 is left undetermined by schrdinger - invariance . if in addition we require that @xmath15 should be non - singular at @xmath98 , the asymptotic behaviour @xmath99 for @xmath100 follows .",
    "provided that form should hold true for all values of @xmath101 , we would obtain approximately @xmath102 indeed , this is found to be satisfied for several ageing spin systems with an underlying free - field theory @xcite . on the other hand , ( [ 4:approx ] ) does not hold true in the glauber - ising model .",
    "work is presently being carried out in order to describe @xmath103 in this model and will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
