    "two of the most important models in two - dimensional fluid dynamics are the ( incompressible ) 2d euler equation , modeling motion of inviscid fluids , and the surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) equation , which is used in atmospheric science models , appearing for instance in pedlosky @xcite . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "the sqg equation was first discussed in the work of constantin , majda , and tabak @xcite .",
    "both these equations ( the former in the vorticity formulation ) can be written in the form @xmath5 along with initial condition @xmath6 and the biot - savart law @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 , and the euler and sqg cases are obtained by taking @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that the biot - savart law for the 2d euler equation is therefore more regular ( by one derivative ) than that of the sqg equation .",
    "global regularity of solutions to the 2d euler equation has been known since the works of wolibner @xcite and hlder @xcite .",
    "the necessary estimates barely close , and the upper bound on the growth of the derivatives of the vorticity is double exponential in time .",
    "recently , kiselev and ver ' ak showed that this upper bound is sharp by constructing an example of a solution to the 2d euler equation on a disk whose gradient indeed grows double exponentially in time @xcite .",
    "some earlier examples of unbounded growth are due to yudovich @xcite , nadirashvili @xcite , and denisov @xcite , and exponential growth on a domain without a boundary ( the torus @xmath9 ) was recently shown to be possible by zlato @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , while existence of global weak solutions for the sqg equation ( which shares many of its features with the 3d euler equation  see , e.g. , @xcite ) was proved by resnick @xcite , the global regularity vs finite time blow - up question for it is a major open problem .",
    "both the 2d euler and sqg equations belong to the class of active scalars , equations of the form where the fluid velocity is determined from the advected scalar @xmath10 itself . a natural family of active scalars which interpolates between the 2d euler and sqg equations is given by with @xmath3 in the above biot - savart law .",
    "this family has been called modified or generalized sqg equations in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , or the paper @xcite by pierrehumbert , held , and swanson for a geophysical literature reference ) . the global regularity vs finite time blow - up question is still open for all @xmath4 .",
    "while the above works studied active scalars with sufficiently smooth initial data , an important class of solutions to these equations arises from rougher initial data .",
    "of particular interest is the case of characteristic functions of domains with smooth boundaries , or more generally , sums of characteristic functions of such domains multiplied by some coupling constants . solutions originating from such initial data",
    "are called vortex patches , and they model flows with abrupt variations in their vorticity . the latter , including hurricanes and tornados , are common in nature . existence and uniqueness of vortex patch",
    "solutions to the 2d euler equation on the whole plane goes back to the work of yudovich @xcite , and regularity in this setting refers to a sufficient smoothness of the patch boundaries as well as to a lack of both self - intersections of each patch boundary and touching of different patches .    the vortex patch problem can be viewed as an interface evolution problem , and singularity formation for 2d euler patches had initially been conjectured by majda @xcite based on relevant numerical simulations by buttke @xcite .",
    "later , simulations by dritschel , mcintyre , and zabusky @xcite questioning the singularity formation prediction appeared , and we refer to @xcite for a review of these and related works .",
    "this controversy was settled in 1993 , when chemin @xcite proved that the boundary of a 2d euler patch remains regular for all times , with a double exponential upper bound on the temporal growth of its curvature ( see also the work by bertozzi and constantin @xcite for a different proof ) .    the patch problem for the sqg equation is comparatively more involved to set up rigorously . local existence and uniqueness in the class of weak solutions of the special type @xmath11 with @xmath12 and periodic in @xmath13 , corresponding to ( single patch ) initial data with the same property , was proved by rodrigo @xcite . for sqg and",
    "modified sqg patches with boundaries which are simple closed @xmath14 curves , local existence was obtained by gancedo @xcite via solving a related contour equation whose solutions are some parametrizations of the patch boundary ( uniqueness of solutions was also proved for the contour equation when @xmath3 , although not for the original modified sqg patch equation ) .",
    "local existence of such contour solutions in the more singular case @xmath15 $ ] was obtained by chae , constantin , c ' ordoba , gancedo , and wu @xcite .",
    "finally , existence of splash singularities ( touch of exactly two segments of a patch boundary , which remains uniformly @xmath14 ) for the sqg equation was ruled out by gancedo and strain @xcite .    a computational study of the sqg and modified sqg patches by c ' ordoba , fontelos , mancho , and rodrigo @xcite ( where the patch problem for the modified sqg equation first appeared ) suggested finite time singularity formation , with two patches touching each other and simultaneously developing corners at the point of touch .",
    "a more careful numerical study by mancho @xcite suggests self - similar elements involved in this singularity formation process , but its rigorous confirmation and understanding is still lacking . in this paper",
    ", we consider the patch evolution for the modified sqg equations , both on the whole plane and on the half - plane , and prove local - in - time regularity for these models ( for all @xmath3 on the plane and for all sufficiently small @xmath4 on the half - plane ) .",
    "our motivation is , in fact , primarily the half - plane case because in the companion paper @xcite we show existence of finite time blow - up for patch solutions to the modified sqg equation with small @xmath4 on the half - plane . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first rigorous proof of finite time blow - up in this type of fluid dynamics models .",
    "let us now turn to the specifics of the model we will study .",
    "we only consider here the case @xmath3 , and we concentrate on the half - plane case @xmath16 .",
    "this is both because this case is our main motivation , and because the proofs are more involved ( in fact , the whole - plane proofs are essentially contained in the half - plane ones ) .",
    "the corresponding patch evolution can then be formally defined via the biot - savart law @xmath17 for @xmath18 , along with the requirement that @xmath10 is advected by the flow given by @xmath19 , that is , @xmath20 where @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and we note that the integral in equals @xmath25 ( up to a positive pre - factor , which can be dropped without loss due to scaling ) , with the dirichlet laplacian on @xmath26 .",
    "the vector field @xmath19 is then divergence free and tangential to the boundary @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath28 when @xmath29 ) .",
    "we have to be careful , however , with the rigorous definition of the evolution because the low regularity of the fluid velocity @xmath19 need not allow for a unique definition of trajectories from when @xmath4 ( existence will not be an issue here because @xmath19 is continuous for @xmath30 ) .",
    "we introduce here the following definition [ d.1.1 ] which , as we discuss below , encompasses various previously used definitions .",
