    "x - ray observations performed in the past two decades have revealed that more than half of the galaxy clusters host a bright , dense core where the intracluster medium ( icm ) has cooled down to temperatures lower than that of the ambient gas , so that such cool core ( cc ; a nomenclature proposed by @xcite ) clusters usually exhibit sharply peaked central x - ray emission .",
    "for example , based on the deprojected imaging analysis of an _ einstein _  sample of 207 clusters @xcite found that cool cores appear in @xmath1 of the clusters . almost at the same time @xcite studied a _ rosat _",
    "sample of 55 clusters and estimated that @xmath2 of the sample members can be classified as cool core systems .",
    "later @xcite presented an imaging spectroscopic study of both _",
    "asca _  and _ rosat _  data of 106 clusters , which were drawn from the hiflugcs ( the highest x - ray flux galaxy cluster sample ; @xcite ; @xcite ) sample , and concluded that about 49% of the sample clusters have cool cores .",
    "recently by analyzing the _ chandra _  data of a statistically complete sample of 64 x - ray selected hiflugcs clusters @xcite found that the chance of the presence of cool core is 72% ( the different claimed cc - fractions is mainly as a result of different definitions of cc , e.g. , see @xcite for study of different cc - diagnostics ) . despite the fact that all these samples whose redshifts are mostly within 0.2 , are flux - limited and thus may be biased to a certain degree toward clusters with a bright core , it is very clear that the cool core can be regarded as a common phenomenon in clusters located at @xmath3 .",
    "the characteristic radiative cooling time of a typical cool core is shorter than the age of the cluster , thus a significant cooling flow of a mass deposition rate of @xmath4 @xmath5 should have been operating as predicted by the traditional cooling flow model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the observed x - ray gas temperatures of the cool cores never fall below a few kev , and much less cooling signature is found than if cooling - flows progressed unimpeded in radio , infrared , optical , and uv bands for the gases postulated to have a broad spectrum of temperature , especially those cooled rapidly to @xmath6 k. the contradiction between theory and observation invokes additional heating mechanisms ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for a comprehensive review ) , among which the heating provided by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is the most prevalent one since it is both adequately energetic and self - regulated . actually a clear cc - agn connection has been suggested via the detections of x - ray cavities , jets , lobes , and probably radio mini - halos ( radio mini - halos are not unambiguously linked to the agn , e.g. , @xcite ) surrounding the radio - loud brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) on roughly the same scales of the cool cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "about 70% of the cc clusters the central dominating galaxy appears as a radio galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in nearly all cc clusters a radio emitting agn creating cavities in the x - ray gas is found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , notice that the radio - fraction depends on the strength of the cc ( i.e. fraction increases from @xmath7 to @xmath8 for weak cc clusters to strong cc clusters , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite found that in a _",
    "chandra _  sample containing 152 groups and clusters all 69 bcgs with a 1.4 ghz power exceeding @xmath9 w  hz@xmath10 possess cool cores .",
    "therefore , it is natural to speculate that the agn outbursts suppress the overcooling of a cc cluster s core region and maintain the cluster in the cc state , meanwhile the feedback from the cooling gas in the cool core fuels and regulates the agn activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the scenario that agn and cool core interact with each other in an adaptive way is self - consistent , it does not fully agree with the observations of non - cool core ( ncc ) clusters , where the cool core has been prevented from forming and the fueling of the agn is expected to have been quenched .",
    "the first counterintuitive case was reported by @xcite .",
    "the authors found that in the relaxed poor cluster awm 4 the gas temperature shows a relatively flat distribution at @xmath11 kev and drops outwards quickly at @xmath12 kpc , inferring that the cool core has been erased by a a past , major heating episode .",
    "this is supported by the facts that the corresponding central cooling time ( @xmath13 gyr ) is long and the central gas entropy is high .",
    "even with the newest high - quality _ chandra _  data only a tiny cool core - like feature or a galactic corona can be identified within the innermost 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a1650 and a2244 that show similar thermodynamic properties @xcite , however , awm 4 harbors an intermediately active central radio galaxy with extended radio lobes out to 100 kpc , which indicates that ncc system can also possess an agn .",
    "in fact similar agn outbursts also appear in about 45% of the ncc systems ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apparently these results expose our poor understanding about the cc - agn relationship , raising the challenging question as to whether there exists a distinct difference between cc and ncc clusters ; in other words , is the dichotomal classification of cc and ncc systems intrinsically reliable ? to answer the question a deeper comparison between the x - ray properties of cc and ncc clusters is apparently necessary .    in order to define the cc - ncc dichotomy",
    "different diagnostics have been proposed in terms of , e.g. , central temperature drop ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , central cooling time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , surface brightness concentration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mass deposition rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or x - ray surface brightness cuspiness ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . to determine which one of these can be used to unambiguously segregate cc from ncc clusters @xcite applied 16 cc diagnostics to a sample of 64 hiflugcs clusters ( @xmath3 ) , and found that the central cooling time is the best diagnostic parameter for nearby clusters with high quality data , whereas the cuspiness is the best for high redshift ( @xmath14 ) clusters . in this work",
    "we further address this issue by introducing a new cc diagnostic based on the study of the x - ray image power spectra , which may provide an exquisitely detailed view of the imaging information ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of 41 galaxy clusters ( @xmath0 ) selected from the _ chandra _",
    "s 15-year data archive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 we describe sample selection criteria and data preparation . in  3 , we present data analysis and calculation of image power spectra . in  4 and  5",
    "we discuss our results and summarize the work , respectively . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath15cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and hubble constant @xmath18 . unless stated otherwise , we adopt the solar abundance standards in @xcite and quote errors at 68% confidence level .",
    "in order to characterize the power spectrum of the x - ray image of a galaxy cluster , a high photon count , an adequate angular resolution , and a relatively complete detector coverage of the cluster should be guaranteed simultaneously .",
    "therefore we constructed our sample by searching the _ chandra _  archive for all public pointing observations of galaxy clusters that satisfies the following three criteria : ( 1 ) the cluster was observed out to at least @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is defined as the radius within which the mean density of the enclosed gravitating mass is 500 times the critical density of the universe at the cluster s redshift ; see  3.2.3 ) , meanwhile the @xmath21 regions is fully or nearly fully covered by the s3 or i0 - 3 ccds of the _ chandra",
    "_  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , ( 2 ) the number of the photons collected within @xmath22 during the observation is more than 12500 cts , and ( 3 ) the cluster should have been classified explicitly as a strong cool core ( scc ) , weak cool core ( wcc ) , or non - cool core ( ncc ) system coincidentally with three traditional cc diagnostics ( i.e. , diagnostics based on the calculations of central cooling time , cuspiness , and concentration parameter ;  3.2.4 ) . with these selection criteria we selected 41 galaxy clusters as the sample members , whose basic properties are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .    for each cluster we started from the acis level-1 event files and followed the standard _",
    "chandra _  data processing procedure to reduce the data with ciao v4.4 and caldb v4.4.8 . to be specific , we first excluded the bad pixels , bad columns , and events with _ asca _",
    "grades 1 , 5 and 7 .",
    "next we carried out corrections for the gain , charge transfer inefficiency ( for the observations performed after january 30 , 2000 ) , astrometry , and cosmic ray afterglow . by examining the light curve extracted in @xmath23 kev from source - free regions or regions slightly affected by the sources , using * lc_clean * scrip in sherpa we identified and removed the data contaminated by occasional particle background flares during which the count rate is increased by @xmath24 over the mean value .",
    "in addition to above , we masked all the point sources detected beyond the @xmath25 threshold in the acis images with ciao tools * celldetect * and * wavdetect * ( @xcite ) .",
    "in order to construct a local background template for each observation , we extract the spectrum from the boundary regions on the s3 ccd or i0 - 3 ccds , where the influence of the thermal emission of the intracluster medium ( icm ) is relatively weak , and fit the extracted spectrum with a model that consists of the icm emission ( a thermal apec component absorbed by the galactic column density given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gas abundance is fixed to @xmath26 @xmath27 if it is not well constrained ) , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ; a power - law component with @xmath28 , which is also absorbed by the galactic column density ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , the galactic emission ( two apec components with @xmath29 kev and @xmath30 kev , respectively ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the particle - induced hard component derived from the corresponding _ chandra _  blanksky templates available at the _ chandra _  science center . the background template for the observation ( i.e. , galactic + cxb + particle components ) can thus be determined when the best - fit is achieved .",
    "when the corresponding data are available , we have also compared the count rate of our background template calculated in @xmath31 kev , where the effect of the particle component is less significant , with that of the archive _ rosat _  all - sky survey ( rass ) diffuse background maps , and obtained consistent results .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the field - to - field variations of both the galactic and cxb background components in each observation . as an approximation in the analysis that follows we estimate the model parameter error ranges by taking into account both statistical and systematic uncertainties ( 10% as a conservative estimate ; @xcite ) in the background .        for each observation",
    "we define @xmath32 concentric annuli , which are all centered on the cluster s x - ray peak . the width of each annulus is determined to guarantee a minimal photon count of 2500 cts in @xmath33 kev , and for the outermost annulus the condition that the photon count is at least twice",
    "the background should be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "we extract the _ chandra _  acis s3 or i0 - 3 spectra from these concentric annuli , and fit them by using the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec v12.8.2 ( @xcite ) . to minimize the effects of the instrumental background at higher energies and the calibration uncertainties at lower energies , we limit the fittings in @xmath33 kev . in the model",
    "fits , we estimate the influence of the outer spherical shells on the inner ones by using the xspec model project , and fit the deprojected spectra with the optically thin , collisional plasma model apec ( @xcite ) , which is absorbed by the foreground photoelectric absorption model wabs ( the column density @xmath34 is fixed to the corresponding galactic value ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "whenever the gas metal abundance is not well constrained , we fix it to 0.3 @xmath27 .",
    "we add an additional absorbed apec component for the innermost annulus since it might be contaminated by the coexisting multi - phase gases ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if the f - test shows that the fitting is improved at the 90% confidence level . in this case",
    "the icm temperature is defined as that of the hot phase .",
    "smoothed gas temperature profiles , as well as the smoothed metal abundance profiles , are then derived by running cubic spline interpolation to the best - fit model parameters for the annulus set .",
    "finally we calculate the average gas temperature of the cluster ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) by fitting the spectra extracted between @xmath35 (  3.2.3 ) using the same spectral model as above .",
    "we create the exposure map for each observed image by using the spectral weights calculated for an incident thermal gas spectrum that possesses the same average temperature and metal abundance as the cluster (  3.2.1 ) . after the x - ray images are corrected by applying the exposure maps to remove the effects of vignetting and exposure time fluctuations , we use concentric annular bins , which are all centered at the x - ray peak of the gas halo , to extract the x - ray surface brightness profiles @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the two dimensional radius ) in @xmath33 kev .    under the assumptions of hydrodynamic equilibrium and spherical symmetry , the three - dimensional distribution of gas electron density @xmath38 can be expressed with a @xmath39-model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the density @xmath48 is determined when the best - fit to the observed surface brightness profile is achieved via @xmath49-test .      in order to derive the characteristic radius @xmath20 , we first calculate the distribution of the total gravitating mass of the cluster in the regions covered by _",

    "the comparison of @xmath60 between this and previous work ( @xcite ) was shown in figure 1 , the results are consistent with each other .      using the observed profiles of x - ray surface brightness , gas temperature , metal abundance and gas density",
    ", the clusters in our sample can be classified explicitly as an scc , wcc , or ncc system coincidentally with three frequently quoted traditional cc diagnostics , i.e. , the central cooling time ( cct , hudson et al .",
    "2010 ) @xmath61 cuspiness ( vikhlinin et al . 2007 ) @xmath62 and surface brightness concentration parameter ( santos et al . 2008 ) @xmath63 which is the ratio of the integrated surface brightnesses within central 40 kpc to that within 400 kpc . with these diagnostic parameters and the corresponding criteria listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] ,",
    "the sample clusters are classified as an scc , wcc , or ncc system , as shown in column 8 before the slash mark in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we find that in nine out of 12 scc clusters the ratio of the central luminosity excess to the total luminosity integrated within @xmath19 ( @xmath64 ) is significant , ranging from about @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( table  [ tbl-3 ] ) . in seven out of nine wcc clusters a central surface brightness excess",
    "is detected , but the ratio @xmath67 is much lower ( typically a few percent ) except in a1651 ( @xmath68 ) and eso306-g170b ( @xmath69 ) . in ncc clusters",
    "the effect of the central luminosity excess , if it does exist , is actually negligible .      for each cluster",
    "we first calculate the two - dimensional fourier transform of the background - subtracted and exposure - corrected x - ray image ( i.e. , the flux distribution @xmath70 ) , which is not smoothed , as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the wavenumber , and @xmath73 represents the hole image by using the matlab tool fft2 and fftshift .",
    "we removed all the point sources detected beyond @xmath25 threshold , and fill the corresponding regions via interpolation with neighboring pixels assuming poisson statistics .",
    "the ccd gaps between the acis - i chips are filled in the same way .",
    "we find that the systematic errors introduced in the process are much smaller than the statistical errors , which will be estimated below , at wavenumbers that we are interested in ( @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional power spectrum is then obtained as @xmath77 next , we create a random fluctuation distribution @xmath78 for the observed image by running monte - carlo simulations to estimate the fluctuation on each pixel , which is assumed to follow the poisson distribution , and add the fluctuations map into the observed map to create a simulated image @xmath79 ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) .",
    "after 100 simulated images are randomly created , we calculate their power spectra and use the scatter of them to determine the error range of the image power spectrum @xmath81 of the cluster . in the simulation",
    "we have added an additional 5% systematic error to account for the subtle numerical and instrumental effects ( e.g. , errors introduced by the griding of image , the periodic boundary conditions , the inhomogeneity in the exposure between neighboring pixels , and the method of removing and filling point sources ; @xcite ) . the obtained power spectra and the corresponding error ranges for the sample clusters are plotted in figures  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we find that in the log - log space the derived image power spectra of @xmath82 out of @xmath83 sample clusters become flat as the wavenumbers increases and can be represented by a constant component when the wavenumber is large enough ( @xmath84 @xmath85 for @xmath86 clusters , and @xmath87 @xmath85 for seven clusters , @xmath88 @xmath85 for one cluster ) , while at small wavenumbers a power excess beyond the constant component appears in all clusters , with a clear tendency that the power excess is stronger in cc clusters than in ncc clusters .",
    "this is very likely due to the fact that cc clusters usually harbor large bright cores @xcite , which may significantly enhance the power on scales comparable to the cooling radius ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 as shown in table  [ tbl-3 ] ; cooling radius is the radius within which the gas cooling time is @xmath91 yr , the light travel time form @xmath92 ; @xcite ) . to illustrate this we plot the relative core brightness ( defined as the ratio of integrated surface brightness within central 0.048@xmath20 to that within 0.45@xmath20 ) against the power ratio ( defined as the ratio of power at 0.35@xmath20 to that at large wavenumbers where image power spectra reduce to a constant component ) which reflect the power excess we mentioned above in figure  [ fig3 ] , and find that there indeed exists an unambiguous correlation between the two parameters .",
    "we also have attempted to fit the observed power spectra by adding a @xmath39 component into the model to represent the power excess , and find that in all sample clusters the model ( @xmath39+constant component ) can provide an acceptable fitting to the power spectrum in the log - log space ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the model that consists of two @xmath39 components always gives a relatively poor fit to the observed power spectrum in nearby all galaxy clusters .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "we plot the two - dimensional power spectra of the x - ray images of all sample clusters , together with the same power spectrum set scaled by @xmath20 ( x - axis ) and the power at @xmath93 ( y - axis ) . in all cases",
    "the power spectra is truncated at five @xmath94 . in the figures",
    "we color - code the power spectra according to the classification based on the traditional cool core diagnostic parameters ( i.e. , central cooling time , cuspiness , and concentration parameter ; see  3.2.4 and table  [ tbl-2 ] ) : blue for scc clusters , green for wcc clusters , and red for ncc clusters .",
    "the errors are typically about 10% for small wavenumbers and 20% for large wavenumbers , which consistent with the errors of @xcite in the same scale ( @xcite specifically studied perseus cluster ) , and are not shown in the figures for a better visualization of the profiles . despite the large scatter , we find that there are systematic distinctions between the shapes of the unscaled power spectra of scc , wcc , and ncc systems .",
    "the distinctions become more obvious when we examine the scaled power spectra , which implies that the _ chandra _ image power spectra may be used to classify galaxy clusters located with in z @xmath95 as cc or ncc systems , as will be discussed below .",
    "in order to characterize the distinctions between the image power spectra of scc , wcc , and ncc systems , for each cluster we locate two specific points on the line of the scaled power spectrum at wavenumbers @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which correspond to the scales of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the real image space , respectively , and use the two points as the left - top and right - bottom vertices to determine a rectangular box ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . using this box",
    "we introduce a new cc diagnostic parameter , i.e. , the power excess index ( pei ) , to quantify the degree of the power excess as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote the box areas below and above the line of the power spectrum , respectively .",
    "the cc diagnostic defined in such a way shows several potential advantages over its counterparts , which may be helpful in future large surveys such as e - rosita .",
    "for example , the application of pei is free of the effects of centroid shift of the x - ray halo caused by merger event , which may make the determination of centroid of the x - ray gas halo ambiguous is given by , e.g. , the @xmath20 -temperature / luminosity scaling relations @xcite ] , and the corresponding calculation is straightforward , almost irrelevant to the complicated spectral analysis .",
    "we then classify the clusters in our sample with the new diagnostic parameter and the corresponding criteria listed in table  [ tbl-2 ] , and show the results in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "we find that our classification agrees very well with those achieved with the traditional cc diagnostics , which are also displayed in figure  [ fig6 ] , except for the cases of a2319 , a2667 , and zwcl0015 .",
    "possible reasons for the differences in classification are discussed below .",
    "_ this is a nearby , massive merging system showing a huge radio halo that extends out to about 35  ( @xmath103 mpc ; @xcite and references therein ) . by examining the _ chandra _  image",
    "we find that the core region of the cluster is loose , flat , but well developed with distinct boundaries .",
    "in addition to this the core also shows a hierarchical structure with one flat core embedded in another . using the pei diagnostic , which is sensitive to such imaging substructures , we classify the cluster as a wcc system .",
    "this is supported by the results of @xcite , who revealed a relatively weak cool gas clump slightly south of the x - ray peak on the _ chandra _  temperature map and identified it as a previously unknown cool core .",
    "on the other hand we find that , because the gas temperature is high and the core is loose , comparing with typical wcc clusters a2319 tends to possess a longer central cooling time and a lower concentration parameter .",
    "this is why it is classified as an ncc cluster with traditional cc diagnostics .    _",
    "_ we classify this luminous cluster as an scc system using the pei diagnostic , and this is supported by the drastic gas temperature drop detected in the central 100 kpc in our deprojected spectral analysis ( fig .",

    "observation indicated that the cluster shows strong evidence for a cooling core @xcite , which is supported by the appearance of strong @xmath104 and [ o ii]@xmath1053727 lines from the central dominating galaxy @xcite .",
    "note that , using the central cooling time and concentration diagnostics the cluster can be classified as an scc system marginally ( @xmath106 confidence level ) , while using the cuspiness diagnostic the cluster is classified as a wcc system ( close to an ncc system ) .    _",
    "zwcl0015  _ this cluster is less studied in literature compared with the above two abell systems . on its _ chandra _  image",
    "we find that , although the emission from the core region is sharply peaked , which leads to a lower central cooling time and slightly higher surface brightness concentration than typical ncc clusters , the x - ray emission from the core is apparently weaker than most wcc clusters .",
    "moreover the gas temperature profile of this cluster shows very mild spatial variations and is actually consistent with a constant distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . due to these facts",
    "the cluster is classified as an ncc system using the pei diagnostic , instead of a wcc classification suggested by the traditional cc diagnostics .    in order to investigate whether or not the pei diagnostic is applicable to clusters located within @xmath107 or even at higher redshifts , we select three cc clusters ( a1068 , a1664 and rxcj2014.8 - 2430 ) , wcc ( a2667 , a795 , and a963 ) , and ncc ( a2104 , a2443 , ac114 ) clusters respectively , each possessing an intermediate appearance in its own classification , as the templates , and create the corresponding simulated clusters that are located at @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , by cloning the three template clusters under the assumption of non - evolution . in the process of cloning we have assumed a typical 50 ks of _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _ exposure , and have taken into account the effects caused by the changes of angular and luminosity distances ( see @xcite for more details of this approach and @xcite for the original application in the optical band ) .",
    "we find that , if spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratios that can be achieved in typical _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ observations are assumed , the pei diagnostic can work well at @xmath108 if the flux of the simulated cluster is no less than @xmath111 erg @xmath112 @xmath113 for _ chandra _ or @xmath114 erg @xmath112 @xmath113 for _ xmm - newton _ , which roughly correspond to intermediately sized clusters with a gas temperature of @xmath115 kev .",
    "the comparison between the pei classifications of the simulated clusters and the pei classifications of the origin ones was shown in figure 8 .",
    "for simulated clusters located at @xmath116 the pei diagnostic fails in about @xmath24 cases due to the limited signal - to - noise ratio and spatial resolution of a typical _ chandra_/_xmm - newton _ observation . based on these results ,",
    "we conclude that with current _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data , the new diagnostic can be safely applied to at least intermediate redshifts as a useful complement to the traditional diagnostics , and to even higher redshifts with higher quality data provided by future missions .",
    "it is worth noting that the power excess begins at @xmath117 @xmath85 in @xmath86 clusters ( @xmath118 of the sample ) , and at @xmath119 @xmath85 for seven clusters ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "these correspond to @xmath121 kpc or @xmath122 kpc in real space , scales at which the fluctuations of x - ray surface brightness , gas density , and velocity were found ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fluctuations , which are speculated to be caused by either agn feedback , or merger , or both , may contribute part of the power excess but not all , since the fluctuations should be detected at relatively low levels compared with the significance of the power excess ( @xmath123 magnitude for scc , @xmath124 magnitude for wcc at @xmath125 kpc , @xmath126 magnitude for ncc at @xmath127 kpc ) . to further evaluate this",
    ", we have attempted to use a two - dimensional @xmath39 or @xmath128 model , which is spatially smoothed , to approximated the emission distribution of the sample clusters .",
    "we find that the power spectra calculated from the modeled clusters show similar power excess as observed . despite this , to quantitatively answer the question about how much the gas fluctuations contribute to the observed power excess still remains an interesting task in the future .",
    "we propose a new cc diagnostic based on the study of the two - dimensional power spectra of the _ chandra _  x - ray images of 41 galaxy clusters ( @xmath0 ) . by calculating the power excess index",
    "we find that the cc - ncc classification based on our new diagnostic agrees very well with those obtained by the traditional cc diagnostics .",

    "<S> in this work we propose a new diagnostic to segregate cool core ( cc ) clusters from non - cool core ( ncc ) clusters by studying the two - dimensional power spectra of the x - ray images observed with the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory . </S>",
    "<S> our sample contains 41 members ( @xmath0 ) , which are selected from the _ chandra _  archive when a high photon count , an adequate angular resolution , a relatively complete detector coverage , and coincident cc - ncc classifications derived with three traditional diagnostics are simultaneously guaranteed . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the log - log space the derived image power spectra can be well represented by a constant model component at large wavenumbers , while at small wavenumbers a power excess beyond the constant component appears in all clusters , with a clear tendency that the excess is stronger in cc clusters . by introducing a new cc diagnostic parameter , i.e. , the power excess index ( pei ) , </S>",
    "<S> we classify the clusters in our sample and compare the results with those obtained with three traditional cc diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the results agree with each other very well . by calculating the pei values of the simulated clusters , we find that the new diagnostic works well at redshifts up to 0.5 for intermediately sized and massive clusters with a typical _ chandra _  or _ xmm - newton _  pointing observation . </S>",
    "<S> the new cc diagnostic has several advantages over its counterparts , e.g. , it is free of the effects of the commonly seen centroid shift of the x - ray halo caused by merger event , and the corresponding calculation is straightforward , almost irrelevant to the complicated spectral analysis . </S>"
