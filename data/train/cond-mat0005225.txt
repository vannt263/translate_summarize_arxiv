    "whether a thermodynamic phase transition underlies the transformation of a supercooled liquid into an amorphous solid , or _",
    "glass _ , at the laboratory glass transition temperature @xmath0 is among the central questions addressed by numerous researchers studying the supercooled liquid and glassy states .",
    "the notion of configurational entropy@xcite has played a significant role in attempts to define and understand the thermodynamic nature of the glass transition . in recent times , there have been various attempts to determine the configurational entropy of realistic liquids analytically and by computer simulations @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to compare two such methods that have been studied recently , namely the evaluation of the configurational entropy _ via _ the analysis of local potential energy minima or _ inherent structures _ ( is)@xcite , and by the calculation of _ basin _ free energies by confining the liquid within a localized region of configuration space by the imposition of constraints@xcite . these approaches , and results from their implementation , are described in the following sections .",
    "the model liquid studied is a binary mixture of @xmath1 type @xmath2 and @xmath3 type @xmath4 particles , interacting _ via _ the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , with parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which has been extensively studied as a model glass former@xcite .",
    "results presented in sec .",
    "ii are from molecular dynamics simulations , at a reduced density @xmath10 , which have been described in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "since the density is fixed , the dependence on density is not always shown explicitly in the following .",
    "in the inherent structure approach@xcite , one considers the division of configurational space into basins of local potential energy minima . in practice such basins",
    "may be defined as the set of all points in configurational space that maps to the given local minimum under a specified local energy minimization procedure . quite generally , one may then write the total partition function of the system as a sum of restricted partition function integrals over individual basins .",
    "rewriting the partition function in this way introduces an entropy term associated with the number of local potential energy minima . with the expectation that configurations within a given basin are accessible to each other by thermal agitation",
    "while those belonging to distinct minima may not be , the number of distinct potential energy minima can be seen to be a measure of the number of physically distinct configurations or structures the system can adopt , _",
    "i. e. _ a measure of the configurational entropy .",
    "thus , the canonical partition function is re - written as a sum over all local potential energy minima , which introduces a distribution function for the number of minima at a given energy : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total potential energy of the system , @xmath13 indexes individual inherent structures , @xmath14 is the potential energy at the minimum , @xmath15 is the basin of inherent structure @xmath13 , @xmath16 is the number density of inherent structures with energy @xmath14 , and the configurational entropy @xmath17 ( note that here @xmath18 is a function of energy ; the equilibrium average of this quantity displayed in fig .",
    "4 as a function of temperature ) .",
    "the probability of finding the system in the basin of an inherent structure of a given energy is given by the above as ,    @xmath19    the probability distribution @xmath20 can be obtained from computer simulations , and offers a means of obtaining @xmath18 , provided one can estimate @xmath21 ( equivalently the free energy @xmath22 of the system ) and the basin free energy @xmath23",
    ".    the free energy at any desired temperature is obtained from thermodynamic integration of pressure and potential energy data from md simulations@xcite .",
    "the absolute free energy @xmath24 of the system at density @xmath25 at a reference temperature @xmath26 is first defined in terms of the ideal gas contribution @xmath27 and the excess free energy @xmath28 obtained by integrating the pressure from simulations : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the number of particles , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the de broglie wavelength , and @xmath33 arises from the mixing entropy .",
    "@xmath34 at a desired temperature may be evaluated by integrating the potential energy , @xmath35 : @xmath36 as observed in @xcite , the @xmath37 dependence of @xmath35 at the studied density is well described by the form @xmath38 , in agreement with predictions for dense liquids@xcite .",
    "a fit of the potential energy data to this form affords a means of extending with confidence the temperature dependence of @xmath35 to @xmath37 values where direct md data is unavailable .    the _ basin free energy _",
    "@xmath23 is obtained by a restricted partition function sum over a given inherent structure basin , @xmath39 . for sufficiently low temperatures",
    ", one may expect the basin to be harmonic to a good approximation . in the harmonic approximation , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 are eigenvalues of the hessian or curvature matrix at the minimum . for individual minima ,",
    "these eigen values are obtained by numerical diagonalization of the hessian .",
    "the basin free energy can then be obtained either as a function of the inherent structure energy ( by averaging free energies within individual energy bins ) or as a function of temperature , by averaging all inherent structures sampled at a given temperature .",
    "@xmath42 is a slowly varying function of temperature ( the temperature dependence is obtained by averaging over @xmath43 , @xmath44 inherent structures at @xmath45 , @xmath46 respectively ) , and is fitted to the form @xmath47 which fits available data quite well .    to    to    if the harmonic approximation to the basin free energy is accurate , inversion of eq .",
    "( [ scdos ] ) , expressing @xmath48 in terms of @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( or @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 , for different temperatures @xmath37 , should result in curves that overlap with each other , as @xmath48 is independent of @xmath37 .",
    "figure 1 shows the result of such inversion , which indicates that below @xmath51 , the various @xmath18 curves do overlap , while they do not at higher @xmath37 .",
    "the procedure applied here is similar to , but improves upon , the procedure of shifting unnormalized @xmath18 curves adopted in @xcite .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "1 indicates that a harmonic approximation to the basin free energy is not valid for temperatures higher than @xmath51 . the temperature dependence of the average inherent structure energy @xmath52 , shown in fig .",
    "2 , is consistent with this conclusion . as discussed in @xcite , a simple expectation for the t - dependence of the average inherent structure energy in the harmonic regime is that @xmath53 .",
    "figure 2 shows that such a t - dependence is indeed valid at low temperatures , but breaks down for @xmath54 .",
    "however , this observation must be viewed in conjunction with two other observations about the topography of the inherent structure basins : ( i ) it has been demonstrated recently @xcite that the separation between ` vibrational ' and ` inter - basin ' relaxation becomes reasonable for temperatures close to and below the mode coupling @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for the model liquid studied here ) .",
    "( ii ) the difference in the potential energy of instantaneous configurations and the corresponding inherent structures is nearly linear with a slope of @xmath57 for temperatures as high as @xmath58 , as shown in fig .",
    "such a linear temperature dependence would normally be associated with harmonic behavior , which in the present case is misleading .",
    "to    the total entropy of the liquid @xmath59 as well as the basin entropy @xmath60 are evaluated as a function of density and temperature from the total and basin free energies .",
    "the configurational entropy @xmath61 and the ideal glass transition @xmath62 are then given by , @xmath63    figure 4 shows the configurational entropy so obtained as a function of @xmath37 . by extrapolation ,",
    "based on the assumption that the potential energy varied with temperature as @xmath64 , the ideal glass transition occurs at @xmath65 , in good agreement with estimates in @xcite .    to",
    "an alternate approach to defining the basin entropy , which has been explored by speedy@xcite is to impose constraints on a liquid to trap it in one of the basins it samples in equilibrium .",
    "a related approach has also been studied in @xcite . with suitably chosen constraints ,",
    "the calculated properties of the constrained system allow the evaluation of the basin entropy .",
    "a reasonable choice of constraint will restrict the system to a physically meaningful set of configurations related to each other without the need for configurational rearrangement .",
    "further , such a constrained system should behave reversibly . in this work ,",
    "the usefulness of one simple constraint is explored , by calculating the configurational entropy for a set of six temperatures at a fixed density of @xmath66 , and compared with corresponding results from the inherent structure calculations described above .",
    "it is found that the constrained simulations result in comparable numbers for the configurational entropy from the inherent structure results .",
    "ten sample configurations are chosen at each temperature , and the voronoi tessellation is performed for each configuration .",
    "the voronoi cell of each given particle , and the corresponding geometric neighbors , correspond to the _ cage _ a particle experiences at short and intermediate time scales .",
    "a configurational rearrangement of particles in the system will result in a restructuring of the voronoi tessellation as well .",
    "thus , the constraint of restricting particles to their voronoi cells is an _ a priori _ reasonable choice .",
    "hence , a constraint is imposed which confines each particle to its voronoi cell during the monte carlo simulation from which the properties of this constrained system are evaluated .",
    "each monte carlo simulation mentioned below is performed for @xmath67 monte carlo steps .",
    "the constrained system can be studied at any desired temperature ; the temperature of the simulation from which the reference configurations are taken will be referred to as the fictive temperature where there is need to distinguish these two temperatures . in order to estimate the configurational entropy",
    ", we must evaluate the free energy of the constrained system .",
    "this is done by thermodynamic integration@xcite from a reference system where each particle experiences a harmonic potential around the initial configuration ( einstein cystal ) .",
    "considering a potential energy function of the form , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a tuning parameter that varies between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the lennard - jones potential of the unconstrained system , @xmath73 is the constraining potential ( which is zero if the constraint is obeyed and infinity if it is not ) , the corresponding free energy is given by @xmath74 .",

    "( [ cga ] ) with respect to @xmath69 , @xmath77 the required average in the above equation is calculated by performing monte carlo simulations for a set of @xmath78 @xmath69 values .",

    "the resulting configurational entropies are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the @xmath18 values from the constrained system simulations are comparable with the inherent structure results , but the agreement is moderate . in particular , the constrained system results vary more weakly with temperature .    to verify that the chosen constraint is a reasonable one , the free energies of the constrained system ( for configurations from equilibrium runs at ( fictive ) temperatures @xmath84 ) are obtained independently at @xmath85 and @xmath86 from thermodynamic integration with respect to the einstein crystal .",
    "simulations are also performed for temperatures in between these two values , from which the temperature dependence of the potential energy is obtained . using eq .",
    "( [ efit ] ) , @xmath87 is calculated by integrating from @xmath86 .",
    "the difference of the directly calculated value and the one by integration is found to be @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 . in other words",
    ", the constrained system appears to be reversible within the margin of error represented by these numbers .",
    "however , the discrepancy in the @xmath18 values between the constrained system and the inherent structure estimates is of the same order .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy in the @xmath18 values for @xmath92 and @xmath93 is roughly the same as the discrepancy in the free energies above .",
    "it is likely that the sample of ten configurations used here is too small to obtain more accurate values .    to",
    "configurational entropy is obtained for a binary mixture liquid from analysis of inherent structures , and from estimation of the basin free energy _ via _ constrained system simulations . while the harmonic approximation used in the inherent structure approach to evaluate the basin free energy is in general questionable , the difficulty in the constrained system approach is the proper choice of constraint .",
    "the values for the configurational entropy obtained are comparable but show only moderate agreement .",
    "further tests for the accuracy of the constrained system results , and more importantly , exploration of improved constraining methods are desirable for making a more stringent comparison of these two methods of calculating the configurational entropy .",
