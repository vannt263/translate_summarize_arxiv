    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is fundamental to the understanding of nuclear physics as a whole .",
    "the elastic scattering of protons and neutrons , at low to medium energies , can be analyzed in terms of a partial - wave expansion , yielding amplitudes that are valuable for comparison to models  @xcite and also as input to more complex processes , such as proton - deuteron scattering  @xcite and deuteron electro - disintegration  @xcite .",
    "fit results have also been used in monte carlo simulations and incorporated into geometry and tracking of the geant4 simulation  @xcite software , a basic tool for low , medium , and high energy groups .    in nucleon - nucleon elastic scattering , as the initial and final state particles all have spin 1/2 , many independent observables are available  @xcite and have been measured over decades of systematic studies at anl , cosy , iucf , lampf , psi , saturn , triumf , tunl and other facilities .",
    "this has allowed a direct scattering amplitude reconstruction ( dar )  @xcite at a number of energies and angles .",
    "we compare our results with these reconstructions below .",
    "our last published analysis  @xcite ( sp07 ) of the nucleon - nucleon database was completed in 2007 and largely motivated by data provided by the edda collaboration  @xcite , with some data also coming from the saturne  ii and pnpi groups .",
    "the most recent measurements have been fewer in number but greater in effect .",
    "this is true for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .",
    "recent cosy - wasa measurements  @xcite of the @xmath1 scattering observable , @xmath2 , have shown a sharp energy dependence , over a narrow energy range , when combined with the trend displayed by existing lower - energy data  @xcite .",
    "this behavior was not predicted by the sp07 analysis , nor was it seen in previous fits  @xcite . in a revised fit",
    "@xcite , this narrow structure was reproduced with the generation of a pole , at @xmath3 $ ]  mev in the coupled @xmath4@xmath5 partial waves , closely related to the resonance mass and width ( @xmath6  mev , @xmath7  mev ) , deduced from wasa analyses of related two - pion production measurements  @xcite .",
    "we subsequently compared the predictions of fits to @xmath1 scattering data , with and without a pole , to search for other potentially sensitive observables  @xcite .",
    "experimental tests are limited by the existing @xmath1 database , which supports a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) only up to a laboratory kinetic energy of 1.3  gev .",
    "no single measurement is capable of extending the range of pwas .",
    "a programmatic study would be required and this is unlikely to occur in the near future .    for @xmath0 elastic scattering , measurements of near - forward differential cross sections  @xcite and the polarization quantity  @xcite , @xmath2 , from the cosy - anke collaboration , were poorly predicted by the sp07 fit .",
    "the simple inclusion of these data in the full database did not generally result in a significant improvement .",
    "below we discuss the fitting strategy and its connection to recent ( sp07 )  @xcite and older ( sm97 )  @xcite pwa results .",
    "the sp07 analysis is accessible via the scattering analysis interactive database ( said ) website  @xcite .",
    "the fit form is based on the product of exchange and production s - matrices .",
    "the exchange piece is parametrized via a k - matrix and contains a one - pion exchange term plus a sum over expansion bases containing a left - hand cut .",
    "the production piece is parametrized in terms of a chew - mandelstam k - matrix and allows for the production of an inelastic channel . for the isovector waves ,",

    "the overall systematic error , @xmath14 , is used to weight an additional @xmath9 penalty term due to the renormalization of angular distributions in the fit by the factor @xmath15 .",
    "the partial - wave solution ( sp07 ) was determined through a fit to approximately 25 thousand @xmath0 data ( to 3  gev ) and 13 thousand @xmath1 data ( to 1.3  gev ) .",
    "compared to the recent @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath0  @xcite @xmath2 measurements , sp07 predicted a different forward - angle behavior , for @xmath0 data , and a different shape at the energy corresponding to the proposed wasa dibaryon , for @xmath1 data .",
    "sp07 was able to reproduce the angular behavior of the new and very precise forward @xmath0 cross sections  @xcite , but the resulting renormalization factors ( @xmath15 ) , for several energies , were outside the range expected from the quoted overall systematic errors .",
    "different strategies were used to accommodate the new @xmath1 and @xmath0 scattering data . for the @xmath0 @xmath2 observable , an improved fit was achieved by more heavily weighting the new data , by a factor of 4 , in the fit .",
    "conversely , for the cross sections , the second term in eq .",

    "the energy dependence implied by the new @xmath1 data , together with older measurements , suggest a rapid variation that has been accommodated through the generation of a pole , providing supporting evidence for the wasa dibaryon candidate .",
    "little additional @xmath1 data has been added to the said database since the 2007 pwa and the sharp structure in @xmath2 is localized to a narrow energy range . as a result ,",

    "we have also observed that the fit wf16 has a @xmath24 partial wave remarkably similar to that found in the older sm97 solution , which featured a different treatment of the total cross sections .",
    "the weighted fit , wf16 , was constructed to improve the description of new cross section and @xmath2 data . however , by increasing the weight of new data , older data are implicitly given less weight , resulting in a degraded fit .",
