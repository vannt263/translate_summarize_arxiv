    "it is commonly believed that qcd at high temperature @xmath1 is in a deconfined phase , that is the system is composed by a gas of quarks and gluons interacting with a coupling @xmath2 .",
    "therefore perturbation theory is reliable at energy scales of order @xmath3 .",
    "this picture runs into problems when one probes the softer scale @xmath4 , where contributions of the same order are generated at every order in perturbation theory @xcite . at high temperature",
    "the relevant @xmath4 contributions are obtained by resumming the one - loop feynman diagrams ( hard thermal loop resummation @xcite ) .",
    "however , in non - abelian gauge theories there is another major obstacle in performing perturbative computations .",
    "since the static magnetic fields are not screened at htl level , one finds wild infrared divergences at order @xmath5 , scale in which one expects such a magnetic mass to be dynamically generated by the interacting theory .",
    "therefore there is a need for new resummation methods .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we proposed a possible approach .",
    "the basic idea is to consider a `` cold '' @xmath6 quantum system and add thermal fluctuations at lower and lower frequency scales , until the non - perturbative scale @xmath7 is reached . in this way",
    "the system is thermalized at larger and larger distances until the scale @xmath7 is reached `` smoothly '' .",
    "this corresponds to performing a coarse - graining  la wilson @xcite for the thermal fluctuations .",
    "we will call such a method thermal renormalization group ( trg ) .",
    "this approach is inspired by continuum wilson or `` exact '' renormalization group ( erg ) @xcite@xcite , in which one starts with the microscopic ultraviolet action and adds quantum modes with frequency larger than a coarse - graining scale @xmath8 .",
    "by continuously varying @xmath8 one gets the erg flow equations in the form of partial differential equations in @xmath8 , which can be integrated to obtain the full quantum theory at @xmath9 .",
    "the main difficulty associated to the application of erg to @xmath6 gauge theories is that it is not possible to introduce the infra - red cut - off @xmath8 in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "therefore the slavnov - taylor identities of the theory are violated and one can only hope to recover them once the cut - off is removed @xcite@xcite .    one encounters similar difficulties when the erg is applied to thermal field theories . if one tries to perform a coarse - graining of both quantum and thermal fluctuations , the st identities are necessarily violated by the coarse - graining scale @xmath8 and it is much more difficult to extract gauge - invariant quantities ( see for instance @xcite ) .    however , as explained above , the problem is simpler if one is interested in resumming  la wilson the thermal modes only , namely in trg .",

    "interpolates between the renormalized theory at @xmath6 ( @xmath11 , no thermal modes have been integrated out ) and the theory in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath3 ( @xmath9 , all the thermal modes have been integrated out ) .    for a finite value of the cut - off",

    "i.e. _ renormalized , system out of thermal equilibrium , with a @xmath8-dependent density matrix @xmath12 . from a physical point of view",
    ", the better status of gauge symmetry in this approach can be easily understood .",
    "indeed , the expectation values and the green functions in an out - of - equilibrium system differ from those at @xmath6 ( and from those in thermal equilibrium ) because of the different weights of the _ physical _ states in the thermal average . but , as long as no unphysical states are introduced , the brs variation and the thermal averaging are commuting operations and the slavnov - taylor identities are completely analogous to the ones at @xmath6 , provided the vacuum expectation values are interpreted as thermal averages with respect to the density matrix @xmath12 @xcite .    from a technical point of view",
    ", varying the density matrix corresponds to changing the temporal boundary condition that has to be given in order to invert the quadratic part in the lagrangian and define the free propagator .",
    "the lagrangian itself is not modified and retains all its symmetries .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the usual formulation of the wilson rg in which the introduction of the cut - off breaks the brs invariance of the lagrangian explicitly @xcite@xcite .    in order to implement this modification of the temporal boundary conditions we need a _ real - time _ formalism suited to describe a system with an arbitrary initial density matrix",
    ". therefore we find it appropriate to use the closed time path ( ctp ) method @xcite@xcite , which is a general formalism to deal with out of equilibrium problems .",
    "the ctp technique is a generalization of the real time ( rt ) @xcite formulation of equilibrium thermal field theories and involves a doubling of the degrees of freedom .    in ctp",
    "the information about the initial state is encoded in source terms concentrated at @xmath13 . by invoking an adiabatic switching - off for the couplings ,",
    "such information is contained as boundary conditions in the free propagators . by giving equilibrium boundary conditions ,",
    "one recovers the path - integral representation for the generating functional of the usual real time equilibrium thermal field theory given , for instance , in ref .",
    "we modify the boundary conditions by introducing a momentum - dependent temperature @xmath14 such that the path - integral representation for our coarse - grained generating functionals can be obtained by substituting , in the equilibrium path - integral , the bose distribution for a cut - off one n_b(|k_0|)n_b(|k_0|,)=(|k|- ) n_b(|k_0| ) .",

    "] to @xmath9 , the resummed green functions to all orders in thermal perturbation theory are obtained .",
    "another advantage of using the trg in studies at high temperature is that the boundary condition for the flow equations at @xmath16 is just the full quantum theory at @xmath6 , which is directly related to the physical parameters .",
    "the presence of the infra - red cut - off allows a reliable computation of the initial conditions in the framework of zero temperature perturbation theory .",
    "a good and clear control over the initial conditions is indeed a necessary requirement when one is interested in small thermal effects such as the generation of a magnetic mass for the gluon , which we expect to be @xmath17 . on the other hand , using as initial condition the bare theory at some ultraviolet cut - off , as one is forced to do in the erg , the connection between the physical parameters and the initial ones is obtained only after the pure quantum corrections have been included via some approximation of the flow equations at @xmath6 .",
    "there is another advantage in using the real time trg instead of erg at finite temperature in the imaginary time . in a non - interacting thermal gauge field theory",
    "it is not necessary to give thermal fluctuations to the unphysical degrees of freedom , such as ghosts and longitudinal gluons ( only physical transverse particles are in contact with the thermal bath and get heated ) .",
    "therefore the feynman rules to construct perturbation theory can be simplified in such a way that only the propagator of transverse gluons receives thermal boundary conditions .",
    "this is true both in physical gauges ( such as axial @xcite@xcite ) and covariant gauges @xcite . in this way",
    "only the transverse modes of the gluons have to be coarse - grained and one gets simplified trg flow equations .",
