    "since the seventies ( zuckerman & evans 1974 ) it has been recognised that the observed star formation rate in the milky way is only a few percents of what we would expect if all molecular clouds were to be in spherical free - fall collapse .",
    "this led to the development of a number of theories in which clouds are quasi - statically evolving over several tens of free - fall times , magnetic and/or turbulent pressure preventing them from collapsing on all scales down to core sizes ( e.g. krumholz & tan 2007 ) .",
    "this picture , though , is not supported by recent results suggesting that the rapid global collapse of massive - star forming clouds is responsible for the formation of very massive cores at the centre of their gravitational potential well ( e.g. peretto et al . 2013 ) .",
    "systematic studies on cloud dynamics are crucially needed to better understand the dynamical evolution of star - forming clouds and how it relates to the star formation rate in the galaxy . in this context , we have studied a sample of infrared dark clouds , in search for dynamical patterns that give some insight into the modes of gravitational collapse at cloud scales .",
    "we present the analysis of a sample of 27 infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) taken from the peretto & fuller ( 2009 ) irdc catalogue .",
    "they have been selected to lie within a narrow range of kinematical distances , i.e. 3  kpc  @xmath0  5  kpc .",
    "we used higal data ( molinari et al .",
    "2010 ) to compute h@xmath1 column density maps towards each of the 27 irdcs .",
    "this was done by performing a 4-point pixel - by - pixel fit of the spectral energy distribution at 160/250/350/500  @xmath2 .",
    "the angular resolution of these column density maps is 36 .",
    "we used these maps along with the clouds kinematic distances to estimate the masses , sizes , and aspect ratios of all 27 irdcs ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we also mapped each cloud with the iram 30 m in the n@xmath1h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) and hco@xmath3(1 - 0 ) lines .",
    "the angular resolution of these observations is 27 , while the velocity resolution is 0.16  km / s .",
    "the rms noise in the iram data is @xmath4  k. we analysed these iram data , in combination with the herschel data , to investigate the dynamical state of these clouds .",
    "( 1 - 0 ) blue - shifted , red - shifted , and symmetric line shapes , respectively.,width=377 ]",
    "we split our clouds into three categories based on the shape of the hco@xmath3(1 - 0 ) line emission : i. self - absorbed blue shifted emission ; ii .",
    "red - shifted emission ; iii .",
    "symmetric emission .",
    "the reason for doing so is that self - absorbed blue shifted emission lines are usually interpreted as signatures of infall , even though the interpretation can be trickier in clouds with complex morphologies and velocity fields ( smith et al .",
    "overall , 41% of our sample is dominated by infall signatures , 22% by expansion signatures , and 37% with no specific signatures .",
    "h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) fwhm average over the clouds vs free - fall velocities .",
    "the colour coding of the symbols is the same as in fig .  1 . ( right )",
    ": square root of velocity structure functions for all clouds.,title=\"fig : \" ] h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) fwhm average over the clouds vs free - fall velocities .",
    "the colour coding of the symbols is the same as in fig .  1 . ( right )",
    ": square root of velocity structure functions for all clouds.,title=\"fig:\",width=154 ]    we then used the optically thin n@xmath1h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) line to estimate the velocity dispersion of the irdcs , averaged over the extent of each cloud , and compute their virial ratios @xmath5 following @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius of the cloud , @xmath8 is the 1d velocity dispersion , and @xmath9 is its mass .",
    "here we have assumed a cloud density profile @xmath10 , consistent with the herschel observations .",
    "figure 1 shows that the distribution of @xmath5 for our sample is consistent with @xmath11 , implying that all clouds are self - gravitating .",
    "we do not see any clear emerging trend between cloud properties ( mass , size , aspect and virial ratios ) and hco@xmath3(1 - 0 ) infall signatures .",
    "this could indicate either that hco@xmath3(1 - 0 ) line profiles are not reliable indicators of infall and/or that virial ratios as we estimated them do not tell us much about the dynamical state of clouds .",
    "if low @xmath5 clouds are evolving quasi - statically , then strong magnetic fields must provide the necessary support to prevent their collapse .",
    "the field strength which is required is of a few tenths of mg on scales of a couple of parsecs .",
    "this is marginally compatible with magnetic field strengths reported in the literature ( crutcher 2012 ) .",
    "if the irdcs of our sample are all collapsing , then we might expect a relationship between the free - fall velocity of the clouds and its observed velocity dispersion .",
    "the free - fall velocity @xmath12 is computed via @xmath13 .",
    "figure  2 ( left ) displays @xmath12 versus the full - width at half - maximum ( @xmath14 ) of the n@xmath1h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) line for all irdcs .",
    "we see that there is a linear correlation between these two quantities pointing towards the possibility that the gas velocity dispersion is driven by the gravitational collapse itself ( see also traficante et al . in this chapter ) .",
    "however , note that a one - to - one correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath8 means a constant @xmath5 ratio .",
    "therefore , the factor @xmath15 dispersion observed in fig .",
    "2 ( left ) is mirrored by a factor of @xmath16 in dispersion in fig .  1 ( right ) since @xmath17 .",
    "in the collapse scenario , low @xmath5 clouds could be in an early evolution of collapse .",
    "column density contours .",
    "( middle ) : modelled velocity field obtained as described in the text .",
    "( right ) : observed ( blue solid ) and modelled ( red dashed ) vsfs . ]",
    "we used the n@xmath1h@xmath3(1 - 0 ) line emission to derive the dense gas velocity field projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "these velocity maps show a variety of emission properties , from linear velocity gradients to more complex velocity fields .",
    "to characterise these maps in a systematic and homogenous way , we have used velocity structure functions ( vsf ) .",
    "the vsf we use is defined as @xmath18 ^ 2\\right\\}$ ] where @xmath19 is the coordinates of a pixels , @xmath20 is the space lag between a pair of pixel . note that the usual definition involves an average over all pairs of pixels as opposed to a median , but the median is less sensitive to the noise .",
    "figure  2 ( right ) shows the square root of the vsf for all clouds .",
    "it displays a rather large variety of morphologies , although one can visually define three groups of vsfs : i. linear ; ii . plateaued ; and iii .",
    "the origin and connection between these different vsfs is not clear yet .",
    "to get some more insights on the physical meaning of the observed vsfs , we modelled one specific filamentary irdc showing an oscillatory vsf ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "we modelled its velocity field following @xmath21+v_0\\cos(2\\pi z/\\lambda)$ ] where @xmath22 are",
    "the radial and longitudinal pixel coordinates with respect to the main axis of the filament , @xmath23km / s is the systemic velocity of the cloud , @xmath24km / s / pc is a constant velocity gradient in the radial direction , @xmath25km / s is the amplitude of the longitudinal oscillations , and @xmath26pc is their wavelength .",
    "we then created a velocity map and constructed the modelled vsfs in both radial and longitudinal directions that we visually compared to the observed vsfs ( see fig .",
    "the reasonable agreement suggests that the velocity field of that particular irdc is dominated by a combination of radial collapse and pc - scale fragmentation .",
