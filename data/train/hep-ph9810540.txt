    "measuring of the structure functions is an unique tool for the study of the nucleon internal structure - together with the quark - parton model ( qpm ) giving the relations between the structure functions and the parton distributions , which represent a final , detailed picture of the nucleon . in this sense , these relations , obtained under definite assumptions , are extraordinary important , since the distribution functions themselves are not directly measurable . at the same time , the standard , simple formulas relating the structure and distribution functions are ordinarily considered so self - evident , that in some statements , the both are identified .    the experiments dedicated to the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , are oriented to the measuring either _ unpolarized _ or _ polarized _ structure functions .",
    "the results on the unpolarized functions are well compatible with our expectations based on the qpm and qcd , but the situation for the polarized functions is much more complicated . until now , it is not well understood , why the integral of the proton spin structure function @xmath1 is substantially less , than expected from very natural assumption , that the nucleon spin is created by the valence quarks .",
    "presently , there is a strong tendency to explain the missing part of the nucleon spin as a contribution of the gluons .",
    "it has been also suggested , that the quark orbital momentum can play some role as well .",
    "nevertheless , a consistent explanation of the underlying mechanisms is still missing . during the last years",
    ", the hundreds of papers have been devoted to the nucleon spin structure , for the present status see e.g. @xcite,@xcite , the comprehensive overviews @xcite,@xcite and citations therein .    in the present paper",
    "we summarize and update our discussion started in zav1- @xcite , where we have shown , that the standard formulation of the qpm , conceptually firmly connected with the infinite momentum frame ( imf ) , oversimplifies the parton kinematics . in @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that the effect of oversimplified kinematics in imf can have an impact particularly on the spin structure function @xmath0 , or more exactly , it can substantially modify the relation between the distribution and spin structure functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    "the basic kinematical quantities related to the dis are introduced and particularly the meaning of variable @xmath2 is discussed . in the sec .",
    "[ seca3 ] we consider proton as an idealized system of the quasifree , massive partons with the four - momenta on the mass shell . in the covariant formulation",
    "we deduce the relations between the structure and distribution functions for the unpolarized and polarized case . at the same time , the obtained relations are compared with those derived in the standard , imf approach . in sec .",
    "sec3 . , using the results obtained in the previous sections , we propose a more realistic model of the proton , in which the internal motion of quarks is consistently taken into account . in contradistinction to the standard treatment based on the qcd evolution of the distribution functions in dependence on @xmath3 , our model rather aims at describing the part of distribution and structure function , which is not calculable in terms of the pertubative qcd . in the sec .",
    "the results of the model on the polarized and unpolarized proton structure functions are compared with the experimental data and some free parameters are fixed .",
    "some additional comments on the model and obtained results are done in the sec .",
    "the last section is devoted to the summary and concluding remarks .",
    "first of all let us recall some basic notions used in the description of dis and the interpretation of the experimental data on the basis of the qpm .",
    "the process is usually described ( see fig .",
    "[ yy1 ] ) by the variables @xmath4    as a rule ,",
    "lepton mass is neglected , i.e. @xmath5 . important assumption of the qpm is that the struck parton remains on - shell , that implies @xmath6 bjorken scaling variable @xmath2 can be interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the parton in the nucleon infinite momentum frame ( imf ) .",
    "the motivation of this statement can be explained as follows .",
    "let us denote @xmath7 the momenta of the parton , nucleon and exchanged photon in the nucleon rest frame ( lab ) .",
    "the lorentz boost to the imf ( in the direction of collision axis ) gives @xmath8 where for @xmath9 @xmath10 if we denote @xmath11 then one can write @xmath12 now let the lepton has initial momentum @xmath13 .",
    "if we denote @xmath14 and @xmath15 then @xmath16 and from eqs .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) , ( [ k2 ] ) it follows @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the parton and photon transversal momenta . obviously @xmath19 @xmath20 using this relation the eq .",
    "( [ k8 ] ) can be modified @xmath21 therefore , if the lepton energy is sufficiently high , so @xmath22 , one can write @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angle between the parton and photon momenta in the transversal plane .",
    "so , if parton transversal momenta are neglected , @xmath25 really represents fraction of momentum ( [ k6 ] ) and ( [ k7 ] ) . in a higher approximation the experimentally measured @xmath25 , being an integral over @xmath24 ,",
    "is effectively smeared with respect to the fraction @xmath26 which is not correlated with @xmath27 an estimation of the second term in the last equation can be done as follows .",
    "because @xmath28@xmath29then eqs .",
    "( [ ka10 ] ) , ( [ kb10 ] ) give @xmath30therefore , for @xmath31 we obtain @xmath32and @xmath33which gives @xmath34i.e . @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "therefore @xmath25 can be at sufficiently high @xmath37 considered as a good approximation of @xmath38 ( and vice versa ) .",
    "accordingly , in the next sections we shall frequently use the approximation @xmath39which will considerably simplify calculation of some integrals .",
    "the effect of this approximation is well under control , all relevant relations could be calculated without it , but at a price , that the sense of some obtained expressions would be quite apparent only after a numeric calculation .",

    "in this section we imagine the partons as a gas ( or a mixture of gases ) of quasifree particles filling up the nucleon volume .",
    "the prefix _ quasi _ here means that the partons bounded inside the nucleon behave at the interaction with the external photon probing the nucleon as free particles having the momenta on mass shell .",

    "if this velocity has the opposite direction to the probing electron , then after passing through the whole subset @xmath60 the electron has not still reached backward boundary of the proton , where meanwhile the new partons appeared . and",
    "on contrary , if the velocity of subset has the same direction as the electron , then not all of these partons have the same chance to meet this electron .",
