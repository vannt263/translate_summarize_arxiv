    "new designs of free electron lasers and high - brightness colliders require the modeling of electron bunches with higher charge densities than have previously been studied . in this high - charge regime , self - fields",

    "our results display rather severe self - pinching of the bunch under certain circumstances , implying the existence of a radially inward - directed force which we explain analytically .",

    "it is well known @xcite that for an infinitely long relativistic electron beam , traveling in the positive @xmath10-direction and having constant electron density along @xmath10 , the outward - directed radial space charge force is nearly balanced by the inward - directed lorentz force .",
    "the electron beam is thus subjected to a small net defocusing effect . in this section",
    "we show , for the case of a finite length electron bunch , the origin of a radial force which is directed inward and which generates a pinch in the electron bunch envelope as seen in figure [ fig : bunch1 ] .",
    "the motion of the particles is in the positive @xmath10-direction , cylindrical symmetry is assumed , and the relative longitudinal particle position in the bunch is denoted by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the @xmath10-position of the center of the bunch .    we assume , following @xcite , that all the electrons travel along @xmath10 with uniform velocity @xmath14 , no transverse velocity component is present , and the density @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 $ ] is the normalized longitudinal density distribution , @xmath19 is the pulse charge with appropriate sign , and @xmath20 is the electron bunch radius .",
    "we further assume that the @xmath10- and @xmath21-dependencies of the electric field @xmath22 and magnetic field @xmath23 in maxwell s equations are combined in the variable @xmath24 .",
    "this _ ansatz _ is appropriate when the electrons have a common longitudinal velocity @xmath25 and no transverse motion .",
    "this assumption is violated , as shown by the numerical simulations , after the bunch drifts a significant distance .",
    "it is , however , useful to establish the conditions for the onset of the radial pinching force .",
    "the region in which we will solve maxwell s equations is the inside of a perfectly conductive drift tube of radius @xmath26 .    in view of the symmetry of the problem ,",
    "only the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 components of the fields are present .",
    "the superscript @xmath30 is used to indicate that the fields are computed in the absence of any transverse velocity .",
    "the fourier transform of the electric field is @xmath31 and similar definitions hold for the fourier transforms @xmath32 and @xmath33 of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . for our selection of @xmath35 , a gaussian distribution with standard deviation @xmath36",

    "consequently , the maximum constriction will also occur at the center of the pulse as has been observed in the numerical calculations .",
