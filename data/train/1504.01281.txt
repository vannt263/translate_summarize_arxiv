    "wigner and wishart matrices have been the cornerstones of random matrix theory . they find numerous applications in varied fields of knowledge  @xcite .",
    "the inception of wigner matrices was due to wigner who investigated some special large dimensional random matrices to predict properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of complicated quantum mechanical systems , in particular heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that certain spectral characteristics of these matrices , such as _ semicircular _ distribution of eigenvalues , are universal and in fact shared by a wider class of matrices which are now collectively referred to as wigner matrices .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent surveys . an important family of wigner matrices",
    "is realized when the matrix elements are taken as gaussian random variables .",
    "the resulting ensembles are referred to as gaussian ensembles  @xcite . in the present work we use the terms wigner and gaussian wigner interchangeably to mean complex wigner matrices with gaussian entries , more specifically matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble  @xcite .",
    "wishart matrices predate even wigner matrices and have their origin in the field of multivariate statistics .",
    "these were introduced by wishart who derived the generalized product - moment distribution in normal multivariate population samples  @xcite .",
    "this distribution is now referred to as the wishart distribution . in",
    "what follows , we will be concerned with ensembles comprising complex wishart matrices .",
    "while wigner and wishart matrices themselves offer plenty of aspects to explore , interestingly , various combinations of these also turn out to be of crucial importance .",
    "many such matrix ensembles have their origin in the area of multivariate statistics  @xcite .",
    "a classic example is the jacobi ( manova ) ensemble which incorporates two wishart matrices in a nontrivial manner , and arises in the problems of quantum conductance  @xcite and multiple channel fiber optics communication  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it also pops up in something as remote as a microscopic model of bus transport system  @xcite . in recent years",
    "several other important matrix models have been explored .",
    "some notable examples include product of complex ginibre matrices  @xcite , cauchy - lorentz  @xcite , sum involving wigner and wishart matrices  @xcite , and product of truncated unitary matrices  @xcite .",
    "in addition to their natural connection with multivariate statistics , these are of interest to the fields of telecommunication  @xcite , finance  @xcite , and random supergravity theory  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we proceed further in exploring such exotic ensembles and consider four important matrix models involving wigner and wishart matrices .",
    "the first one comprises a _ ratio _ involving two wishart matrices , the second one consists of the weighted sum of a wigner matrix and a wishart matrix , the third is the product of a wigner matrix and a wishart matrix , and the fourth one embodies the weighted sum of two wishart matrices .",
    "we derive the probability density function for these matrices , and then work out the eigenvalue statistics . the joint density of eigenvalues for these matrix models exhibit biorthogonal structure .",
    "a determinantal representation , based on a generalization of andrief s integration formula  @xcite , is used to compactly express the @xmath0-point correlation function for all these ensembles .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of biorthogonal ensembles in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , and present the result for @xmath0-level correlation function for eigenvalues .",
    "sections  [ sec3][sec6 ] are devoted to the exact results for the above mentioned matrix ensembles which involve nontrivial combinations of wigner and wishart matrices .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec7 ] with a brief summary and outlook .",
    "some relevant derivations are presented in the appendices .",
    "biorthogonal ensembles arise naturally in the study of eigenvalue statistics of two matrix models  @xcite . moreover , matrix ensembles with a unitary invariance breaking external source also give rise to biorthogonal structure  @xcite .",
    "these ensembles exhibit rich mathematical structure and , at the same time , find applications in several important problems which range from quantum transport to multiple antenna telecommunication , to two - dimensional gravity  @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in biorthogonal ensembles of the borodin type  @xcite , which possess the following structure for joint density of its eigenvalues @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is a _",
    "well - behaved _ weight function in the desired domain , and @xmath5 represents determinant . also , @xmath6 is the vandermonde determinant , @xmath7 the normalization factor @xmath8 follows by expanding the determinants and performing the integrals .",
    "the ensuing expression can again be represented as a determinant , as asserted by andrief identity  @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 for the special case of @xmath11 , we obtain the joint probability density of eigenvalues for a unitary random matrix ensemble . we note that if we replace @xmath6 by some other determinant @xmath12 , then we have the most general form of biorthogonal ensemble , as defined by borodin  @xcite .",
    "the approach for calculating correlation function , as discussed below , extends to these as well .",
    "we would like to remark that the biorthogonal ensemble of borodin type emerges after integrating out one set of eigenvalues ( corresponding to one of the matrices ) from the joint probability density of eigenvalues for two - matrix model ; see for example appendix  [ appb ] .",
    "the @xmath0-point correlation function @xmath13 corresponding to eq .",
    "is defined as  @xcite @xmath14 the evaluation of this correlation function usually relies on the explicit construction of biorthogonal polynomials . in  @xcite a recipe has been provided to write down the correlation function in terms of a determinant of a @xmath0-dimensional matrix with entries containing certain two - point kernel .",
    "however , it requires inversion of a matrix .    in the following we use a generalization of andrief s integration formula to express the @xmath0-point correlation function in terms of the determinant of an @xmath15-dimensional matrix  @xcite : @xmath16_{\\substack{j=1, ... ,r\\\\k=1, ... ,n } }   \\\\   [ f_j(\\lambda_k)]_{\\substack{j=1, ... ,n\\\\k=1, ... ,r } }   & [ h_{j , k}]_{\\substack{j=1, ... ,n\\\\k=1, ...",

    "is advantageous in the sense that it can be readily implemented and evaluated in computational packages such as mathematica  @xcite .",

    "if we consider @xmath23 , then the determinant in eq .",
    "collapses to the product of determinants @xmath24 and @xmath25 , along with the factor @xmath26 , and thereby yields @xmath27 , as expected .    as discussed in the introduction , in the following sections we consider four matrix ensembles where such biorthogonal structure emerges .",
    "the joint density of eigenvalues for these ensembles appear in the form of eq .  , and",
    "hence the @xmath0-point correlation function can be written down immediately with the aid of eq .  .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath28 dimensional complex matrices @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are some non - negative scalars ( for definiteness ) , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are positive - definite hermitian matrices , respectively , from the complex wishart distributions @xmath34 here @xmath35 are the respective degrees of freedom for the two distributions .",
    "we may refer to the ensemble described by eq .   as a quotient ensemble .",
    "for @xmath36 we have the usual complex wishart , while the limit @xmath37 leads to the ensemble  @xmath38 , which is a multivariate generalization of the beta distribution of the second kind  @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 share the identical nonnegative eigenvalues as they correspond to the same generalized eigenvalue problem and lead to the secular equation @xmath42 .",
    "we will see below that the above construction leads to a very interesting matrix model whose probability density involves confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind ( tricomi s function ) with matrix argument  @xcite . moreover , this matrix model is of direct relevance to the problem of multiple antenna relay systems  @xcite .    .42        .42     , wishart @xmath33 ) and the ratio , as defined in eq .  .",
