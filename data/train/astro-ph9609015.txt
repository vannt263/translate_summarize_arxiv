    "the three - dimensional distribution of galaxies observed in redshift surveys differs from the true one since the distance to each galaxy can not be determined by its redshift @xmath8 only ; for @xmath9 the peculiar velocity of galaxies , typically @xmath10 , contaminates the true recession velocity of the hubble flow ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1983 ; kaiser 1987 ; hamilton 1992 ) , while the true distance for objects at @xmath11 sensitively depends on the ( unknown and thus assumed ) cosmological parameters .",
    "this hampers the effort to understand the true distribution of large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "nevertheless such redshift - space distortion effects are quite useful since through the detailed theoretical modeling , one can derive the peculiar velocity dispersions of galaxies as a function of separation ( davis & peebles 1983 ) , and also can infer the cosmological density parameter @xmath12 and the dimensionless cosmological constant @xmath13 , for instance ( ballinger , peacock & heavens 1996 ; matsubara & suto 1996 ; suto & matsubara 1996 ) .    theoretically , a conventional tool to predict small - scale relative pairwise peculiar velocity dispersions is the cosmic virial theorem ( peebles 1976 ; hereafter cvt ) . in its simplest form , the prediction is based on the idealistic assumption that galaxies are treated as point particles . as peebles ( 1976 ) remarked , however , the finite size effect is very significant on scale @xmath14 even if one considers a radius of @xmath15 for typical galactic halos . in this paper",
    "we explore this realistic effect in more details and discuss its important impact on the application of the cvt to real observations .",
    "we will also give reliable predictions for the small - scale velocity dispersions of galaxies in cobe normalized cdm models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows ; section 2 briefly describes the cvt both in its simplest and in its more realistic form .",
    "the finite size effect is considered in  3 , first based on a perturbation theory (  3.1 ) and then on a full numerical analysis (  3.2 ) . in ",
    "4 we predict velocity dispersion of galaxies on small scales for cobe normalized cdm models .",
    "discussion and implications of our result , and our main conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "assuming that galaxy pairs are gravitationally in `` statistical equilibrium '' on small scales , peebles ( 1976 , 1980 ) derived an expression for their relative ( one - dimensional ) peculiar velocity dispersion as a function of their separation @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mean density of the universe , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the two- and three - point correlation functions of _",
    "mass_.    the observed two- and three - point correlation functions of _ galaxies _ , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ,",
    "are well approximated by the following forms ( groth & peebles 1977 ; davis & peebles 1983 ) : @xmath23\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the dimensionless hubble constant @xmath28 in units of @xmath29 ) .",
    "thus it is reasonable to assume that the two- and three - point correlation functions of _ mass _ , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , also obey the same scaling except for the overall amplitudes : @xmath32 then a straightforward computation yields @xmath33 where @xmath34 \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq : i0gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] numerically @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "more specifically the cvt predicts the small - scale peculiar velocity dispersion as ( peebles 1976 ; suto 1993 ) @xmath38 the above simple estimate can be improved more realistically by including the finite size of the galaxies , which suppresses the effective gravitational force between pairs , and also possibly changes the behavior of the two - point correlation functions on small scales .",
    "in fact peebles ( 1976 ) already remarked that the above two effects may change the predictions of the velocity dispersions significantly .",
    "more recently bartlett & blanchard ( 1996 ) also discussed the importance of the local mass distribution around pairs in the cvt .",
    "our principal aim here is to describe these effects more extensively using both the perturbation analysis and the full numerical integration . for this purpose",
    "we take account of the former effect by softening the gravitational force according to the plummer law with the softening radius @xmath2",
    ". then equation ( [ eq : cvt1 ] ) is modified as @xmath39 we model the latter effect by incorporating a nonzero core radius @xmath0 as follows : @xmath40 the two modifications can be still described in equation ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) simply by replacing @xmath41 with @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ & & = 2\\pi ( 1+y)^\\gamma   \\int_0^\\infty { t^3 dt \\over ( t^2+w^2)^{3/2 } }    \\int_1^\\infty ds   \\left [ { 1 \\over ( s+y)^\\gamma } + { 1 \\over ( t+y)^\\gamma}\\right ]   k(s , t , y;\\gamma ) , \\label{eq : iyw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { s^2+t^2 - 3y^3 \\over 2s^2t^2 ( 2-\\gamma ) }   \\left[(s+t+y)^{2-\\gamma } - ( |s - t|+y)^{2-\\gamma}\\right ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & { y(y^2-s^2-t^2 ) \\over 2s^2t^2 ( 1-\\gamma ) }   \\left[(s+t+y)^{1-\\gamma } - ( |s - t|+y)^{1-\\gamma}\\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral @xmath46 is divergent for @xmath5 if @xmath47 .",
    "nonzero values for @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 make @xmath46 finite for @xmath50 , therefore incorporating the finite size of galaxies in this way widens the applicability of the cvt compared with its simplest form ( [ eq : cvt1d ] ) .",
    "for realistic cdm models , the mass two - point correlation functions on small scales may be better described by equation ( [ eq : xirc ] ) with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , as will be seen below .",
    "in the case of @xmath4 , the integral @xmath46 converges even for @xmath47 .",
    "then one may treat the effect of nonzero @xmath48 and @xmath49 via perturbation theory . consider the case of @xmath53 first .",
    "let us set @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is a parameter greater than unity and will be determined below ) , and try to find the taylor expansion with respect to @xmath56 : @xmath57 the derivative @xmath58 is explicitly given as @xmath59 k(s , t , u^\\alpha;\\gamma )   \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\alpha\\gamma u^{\\alpha-1 } ( 1+u^\\alpha)^\\gamma \\int_0^\\infty dt \\int_1^\\infty ds   \\left [ { 1 \\over ( s+u^\\alpha)^{\\gamma+1 } } +   { 1 \\over ( t+u^\\alpha)^{\\gamma+1}}\\right ] k(s , t , u^\\alpha;\\gamma )   \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\alpha\\gamma u^{\\alpha-1 } ( 1+u^\\alpha)^\\gamma \\int_0^\\infty dt \\int_1^\\infty ds   \\left [ { 1 \\over ( s+u^\\alpha)^{\\gamma } } +   { 1 \\over ( t+u^\\alpha)^{\\gamma}}\\right ] k(s , t , u^\\alpha;\\gamma+1 ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit of @xmath60 , only the second term gives a non - vanishing contribution : @xmath61 .",
    "\\label{eq : iulim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by setting @xmath62 and then considering the limit @xmath63 , one finds that only the choice of @xmath64 gives the finite value for equation ( [ eq : iulim ] ) which is contributed only by the term proportional to @xmath65 in the square bracket : @xmath66 the above method can be also applied to the perturbative analysis for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and a straightforward calculation yields @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the beta function .",
    "the above expressions clearly show the importance of the finite size effect for the observational value @xmath71 .",
    "since the lowest - order correction term begins with @xmath72 , even a very small value of @xmath48 changes the value of @xmath46 significantly , which will be discussed in details below .",
    "figure [ fig : iywg18 ] plots the results of the numerical evaluation of equation ( [ eq : iyw ] ) for @xmath71 in comparison with the perturbative expansions ( [ eq : iy0 ] ) to ( [ eq : iyy ] ) . in practice ,",
    "here and in what follows we set @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , when we numerically compute the values of @xmath75 and @xmath67 .",
    "the perturbation result is in excellent agreement with the numerical evaluation up to @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and up to @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "also the perturbation correction turns out to provide a reasonably good approximation even up to @xmath81 .",
    "thus for astrophysically relevant values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 , the perturbation formulae ( eqs.[[eq : iy0 ] ] to [ [ eq : iyy ] ] ) are very useful if @xmath82 .",
    "it should be noted that even very small values of @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 significantly decrease @xmath83 relative to the idealistic point - mass approximation @xmath84 ; for @xmath71 , @xmath85 is about 0.8 even if @xmath48 or @xmath49 is @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath48 and @xmath49 is fairly weak as indicated by the perturbation correction ( [ eq : iy0 ] ) to ( [ eq : iyy ] ) .",
    "therefore in a sense most of the effect might be interpreted as the inherent offset originated from the point - mass approximation itself .",
    "if @xmath5 , on the other hand , the above perturbative approach does not work and one should rely on the fully numerical integration .",
    "figures [ fig : iygamma ] and [ fig : iyygamma ] show such results ; @xmath75 and @xmath87 for various values of @xmath88 .",
    "we find the following accurate fitting formulae for @xmath89 : @xmath90^{-1 } , \\\\",
    "i(y , y;\\gamma ) & = & b [ ( y / y_b)^{\\alpha_b } + ( y / y_b)^{\\beta_b } ] ^{-1 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 at least in the range of @xmath92 , the agreement is excellent ( figs . [ fig : iygamma ] and [ fig : iyygamma ] ) between the numerical results and the fitting formulae .",
    "let us consider the predictions for the small - scale velocity dispersions on the basis of the cvt with the finite size effect . with nonzero @xmath2 and @xmath0 , equation ( [ eq : cvt1d ] )",
    "should be explicitly rewritten as @xmath93 due to the @xmath16-dependence of @xmath94 , @xmath95 is not described by a power - law in general , but is still proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ fig : v12g18 ] plots @xmath97 for @xmath71 . as discussed in  3 , even fairly small values for @xmath2 and @xmath0 can reduce the predictions appreciably relative to the case of the point - mass approximation ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath52 , the softening of the force has negligible effect if @xmath98 . since the observed two - point correlation functions of galaxies do not show any noticeable departure from the single power - law at least for @xmath99 , the choice of @xmath100 plotted here might be an extreme example , and already overestimate the finite size effect .    similarly the results for various @xmath88 are plotted in figure [ fig : v12gamma ] for @xmath100 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath101 ( solid curves ) .",
    "the results for larger @xmath88 become more sensitive to the values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 . given the fact that the point - mass approximation fails for @xmath50 , this is reasonable .",
    "it should be also pointed out here that even when @xmath5 @xmath102 increases as @xmath16 because @xmath94 increases more strongly than @xmath103 ; in the case of @xmath100 and @xmath104 relevant for figure [ fig : v12gamma ] , @xmath105 is proportional to @xmath106 = @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 for @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath102 approaches @xmath117 and thus significantly levels off ( around @xmath118 for @xmath100 and @xmath119 for @xmath101 in fig.[fig : v12cdmr ] ) . in any case",
    ", this implies that the scale - dependence of @xmath105 is fairly _ insensitive _ to the value of @xmath88 .",
    "the results presented above are fairly general in the sense that they should be valid as long as the cvt is correct and equations ( [ eq : hier ] ) , ( [ eq : cvtrs ] ) and ( [ eq : xirc ] ) are reasonably good approximation to the reality .",
    "nevertheless the velocity dispersion @xmath102 is still crucially dependent on the parameters including @xmath12 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath88 as well as @xmath2 and @xmath0 which we have discussed in details here . therefore to proceed further one has to assume some sort of specific models . for this purpose",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) models would provide good working hypotheses . in particular very accurate semi - analytical fitting formulae for @xmath123 have been worked out in the literature , which have been successfully tested against high - resolution n - body simulations ( hamilton et al .",
    "1991 ; jain , mo & white 1995 ; peacock & dodds 1994 , 1996 ; mo , jing & brner 1996 ) .",
    "cdm models with the primordial scale - invariant ( harrison -zeldovich ) spectrum have the power spectrum @xmath124 which is asymptotically proportional to @xmath125 for large @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that the two - point correlation function in these models should approach constant on the corresponding scales ; for a purely scale - free primordial spectra of @xmath127 , @xmath123 is proportional to @xmath128 in a linear regime and to @xmath129 in a stable clustering ( strongly nonlinear ) regime .",
    "in other words , we naturally expect the small - scale flattening of the form ( [ eq : xirc ] ) even independently of the finite size effect of galaxies .",
    "this is another reason why the present analysis is very important in realistic cosmological scenarios .",
    "given the cosmological parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath27 , the normalization constant of the fluctuation spectrum can be determined by cobe data ( e.g. , sugiyama 1995 ) , and thus the ( non - linear ) mass correlation function @xmath123 can be analytically calculated ( peacock & dodds 1996 ; mo et al .",
    "we then determine @xmath122 , @xmath88 and @xmath0 by fitting the calculated @xmath123 to equation ( [ eq : xirc ] ) .",
    "so determined @xmath0 does not represent the finite size effect of galaxies , and if it is below @xmath130 , for instance , we may set @xmath101 to include the effect .",
    "therefore as long as the hierarchical relation ( [ eq : hier ] ) holds for the two- and three - point correlation functions of mass , the only remaining parameter is @xmath120 .",
    "although recent numerical and semi - analytical studies indicate that @xmath120 is weakly dependent on the scale ( suto 1993 ; matsubara & suto 1994 ; suto & matsubara 1994 ; jing & brner 1996 ; mo et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is about @xmath131 on scales less than @xmath132 .",
    "we use the following expression for the cobe 2yr data normalization @xmath133 by nakamura ( 1996 ) who performed a fit to the numerical results by sugiyama ( 1995 ) : @xmath134 where @xmath135 } , \\\\",
    "f(x ) & \\equiv & ( 18.1x^{0.2}+7.17x^{0.5}+22.1x+1.23x^2)^{-1 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for definiteness we adopt the baryon density parameter @xmath136 .",
    "note that the cobe 2yr data give a slightly larger normalization amplitude ( roughly by 10 percent ) compared with the cobe 4yr data ( sugiyama 1996 , in private communication ) .",
    "our conclusions below , however , are insensitive to this issue .",
    "table 1 : fitted parameters for cdm models    [ cols=\">,>,>,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : xifit ] plots the two - point correlation functions of mass based on the peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) model and our fits to the form ( [ eq : xirc ] ) for the cdm models in table 1 .",
    "the parameter fitting is performed over the range @xmath137 .",
    "although the fit does not seem so good especially on small scales , any single power - law form ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) yields much poorer fits and the inclusion of the nonzero @xmath0 definitely improve the theoretical prediction .",
    "figure [ fig : v12cdmr ] shows @xmath139 for the three cdm models in table 1 .",
    "the model parameters except for @xmath120 are completely determined from theory and the fitting , and therefore the result is fairly definite .",
    "as mentioned above , recent numerical and semi - analytical results suggest @xmath140 on scales less than @xmath132 . with this value in mind ,",
    "figure [ fig : v12cdmr ] implies that @xmath141 cdm models disagree with the observed values @xmath142 at @xmath143 ( davis & peebles 1983 ; mo , jing & brner 1993 ; fisher et al .",
    "1994 ; marzke et al .",
    "1995 ) by a factor of @xmath144 .",
    "although the conflict with the @xmath141 model has been pointed out frequently in the literature ( e.g. , peebles 1976 , 1980 ; davis & peebles 1983 ; suto 1993 ) , our present prediction is the most precise one from a theoretical point of view . finally in figure [",
    "fig : v12omega ] , we plot @xmath145 as a function of @xmath12 both for @xmath146 and @xmath147 models using the same procedure described here .",
    "clearly only the low - density models are compatible with the observations even if one allows for a factor of @xmath148 uncertainty of the sample - to - sample variation ( suto 1996 ; suto & jing 1996 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note from the figure that softening in the force with @xmath149 has almost negligible effect on the prediction of @xmath150 in the three cdm models ; this is simply because these models have either @xmath151 or @xmath152 .",
    "we have presented a realistic refinement of the cosmic virial theorem by taking into account of the finite size effect of galaxies .",
    "the cvt in its conventional form which treats galaxies as point particles appreciably overestimates small - scale velocity dispersions of galaxies .",
    "although this is already remarked by peebles ( 1976 ) and in a slightly different context by bartlett & blanchard ( 1996 ) , we presented more detailed analysis on the basis of a perturbation theory and systematic numerical calculations .",
    "in particular the former provides a clear physical insight into the finite size effect .",
    "our perturbation formulae ( eqs.[[eq : iy0 ] ]  [ [ eq : iyy ] ] ) , which are accurate enough [ better than 20% in accuracy for @xmath46 ] for most purposes , can be easily and reliably used to correct for the flattening of mass correlation @xmath154 and the force softening for @xmath4 .",
    "we have also presented accurate fitting formulae for @xmath46 for the case of @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we have predicted the pairwise velocity dispersion for cdm models with the cobe fluctuation normalization .    as our result indicates that the flattening of mass correlation @xmath154 has significant effect on the cvt",
    ", one should be very cautious to infer @xmath12 from observational measurements of galaxy - galaxy correlation function @xmath155 and galaxy pairwise velocity dispersions .",
    "although current observations of galaxy clustering have not revealed any noticeable flattening in @xmath155 on small scales , non - linear biasing mechanisms may have complicated the relation between @xmath155 and @xmath154 . moreover , the statistical significance of galaxy clustering on very small scales @xmath156 is still rather poor .",
    "in fact , intrinsic flattening of correlation functions on small scales is expected generally for cdm models with a harrison -zeldovich primordial spectrum .",
    "we have quantitatively pointed out the importance of taking into account such flattening in @xmath154 when one applies the cvt , otherwise the estimated value for @xmath12 would be substantially _ underestimated_.    to avoid the complicated issue of possible non - linear biasing on small scales , one can draw constraints on @xmath12 from a comparison of the measured pairwise velocity dispersion with our predictions for cdm models of various @xmath12 ( see also mo et al .",
    "1996 ) . as long as one relies on the cobe normalization , our cdm predictions are fairly definite ; for realistic cdm @xmath154 with flattening , fortunately , the ( unknown ) force softening even with @xmath157 would not make any difference on the prediction of @xmath158 ( see  4.2 and fig.[fig : v12cdmr ] ) .",
    "the remaining two parameters which would complicate the comparison between the predictions and observations include the normalized amplitude of the three - point correlation functions which is unlikely to be determined accurately from a small sample of galaxies , and a possible velocity bias of galaxies which may result from the dynamical friction but whose quantitative effect is still controversial in literature .",
    "although the present analysis provides a theoretical improvement over the conventional cvt , the usefulness of the cvt to estimate @xmath12 also relies on the quality of the observational data .",
    "in fact , mo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) noted that the observed velocity dispersions vary fairly significantly from sample to sample , and also are sensitive to the modeling of the data .",
    "we will discuss this topic in details elsewhere ( suto & jing 1996 ) .",
