    "the most common temperature dependence of the resistivity of metals , @xmath0 , either decreases to zero or goes to constant value as @xmath1 , depending on which mechanism is dominant , the electron - electron ( -phonon ) interaction or the non - magnetic disorders .",
    "however , a novel resistivity , with @xmath0 being increased as @xmath1 , is discovered @xcite in bulk metals containing magnetic impurities .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the kondo effect as it was worked out by kondo @xcite in 1964 .",
    "the kondo model describes a single magnetic impurity that is locally coupled to the conduction band electrons .",
    "the coupling strength , denoted by @xmath2 , is smeared by the thermal fluctuation and becomes insignificant in the high temperature regime .",
    "however , with the temperature being increasingly lowered , it is renormalized to a much larger value . when @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 being the kondo temperature ) , @xmath2 flows to the strong - coupling limit and leads to the many - body kondo - singlet state , where the local magnetic moment is completely screened by the conduction band electrons @xcite",
    "@xmath3 is termed as the strong - coupling regime . in this regime ,",
    "the system shows the fermi - liquid - like behaviors @xcite . besides",
    ", the perturbative theory in terms of @xmath2 can not be performed .",
    "this difficulty has motivated many exact non - perturbative approaches , including the numerical renormalization group @xcite , the bethe ansatz @xcite and the conformal field theory@xcite . on the other hand , in the weak - coupling regime where the energy scale is much larger than the kondo temperature",
    ", a perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) theory was proposed @xcite , where the bare coupling constant is dressed with the rg flow . through this method ,",
    "one can obtain a clear understanding of the kondo physics as well as a satisfactory estimation of the kondo temperature .",
    "moreover , even though the perturbative rg is in principle applicable only in the weak - coupling regime , it is also very useful to predict possible instabilities at the strong to intermediate couplings .",
    "these predictions have received great success in one - dimensional and two - dimensional models in different fields @xcite .",
    "the rg method has also been numerically extended to search for instabilities including different topological states of matters @xcite .",
    "recently , with the rapid development of the topological state of matters in condensed matter physics , the kondo problem is also updated with new perspectives .",
    "for example , the kondo effect in graphene was extensively studied @xcite , which bears qualitatively different phenomena compared to those in the conventional metals due to the vanishing density of states at the dirac point @xcite .",
    "the kondo problem in the dirac or weyl semimetal was also investigated , where the non - fermi liquid behavior is suggested @xcite .",
    "more remarkably , a new type of topological insulator , termed the topological kondo insulator @xcite , was proposed in the mixed valence compound @xmath5 @xcite , where the band inversion between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 band around the x points in the brillouin zone is the main reason for the non - trivial topology .",
    "the topological kondo insulator is classified by the @xmath8 topological invariant , and is therefore only another realization of the familiar @xmath8 strong topological insulator @xcite . as such , it is much more interesting to ask the question : whether any completely new types of topological state of matters ( rather than only a realization of the familiar topological states ) can be generated by the kondo - related physics and what is the underlying mechanism ?    in this work , we show that a new hybrid topological insulator can be realized in the magnetically doped 2d electron system with a non - trivial quadratic band crossing point ( qbcp ) .",
    "the non - trivial qbcp with @xmath9 berry phase has been theoretically predicted to occur in the surface state of the crystalline topological insulator ( cti ) @xcite , as well as in the two dimensional photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "besides , it is also found in two - dimensional tight - binding electron models with different lattice structures , including the checkerboard @xcite , kagome and honeycomb @xcite lattices .",
    "we study the effect of a kondo impurity on the qbcp .",
    "specifically , the electron - electron interaction and the kondo coupling @xmath2 are investigated on the equal footing . using the perturbative rg method",
    ", we study the renormalization of the coupling constants , where it is found that both the interactions and the kondo coupling are marginally relevant in rg sense , and their competition leads to a particularly interesting rg flow of the parameters . in order to determine the possible ground state , a rg - based mean - field theory",
    "is constructed to study this strong - coupling regime , where we arrive at several conclusions .",
    "in contrast to the conventional kondo problem , a threshold @xmath10 emerges due to the relevant interactions between electrons . for @xmath11 , the screening of the local magnetic moment is suppressed , and the leading instability is the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect .",
    "( b ) for @xmath12 , the kondo - singlet state is developed in the bulk , and it is found to be compatible with the edge states generated by the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "( c ) for @xmath12 , the kondo - effect induces a particular topological phase , which is a coexistence state of the qah and the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect .",
    "this state possesses both nonzero chern number and the spin chern number and enjoys a nonzero quantized charge current and a net transport of spin hall current that are localized at the edges of the cti surface .",
    "this hybrid topological insulator is a direct consequence of the interplay between two marginally relevant operators , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electron - electron interaction and the kondo - coupling .",
    "we consider a two dimensional electron system with a qbcp , which can be described by the hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath13 , where @xmath14^t$ ] , with @xmath15 being the annihilation operator for the electron with the spin @xmath16 and the flavor @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath17 represent the pseudo spin degree of freedom , whose physical meaning depends on the specific models .",
    "it can either denote the sublattice or the orbital degrees of freedom . in what follows ,",
    "we regard @xmath17 as the orbital index .",
    "then , the single particle hamiltonian of the qbcp reads , @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the orbital and spin degrees of freedom respectively and @xmath22 is the identity matrix in the orbital space . in the following ,",
    "we focus on the particle - hole symmetric case where @xmath23 .",
    "the special feature of the above hamiltonian , as was studied in ref.@xcite , is that it depicts a qbcp with the berry phase @xmath9 .",
    "this type of energy node is robust in the sense that the lattice symmetry ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) or the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) has to be broken in order to lift the energy degeneracy and open up a gap , leading to the split of the qbcp into dirac cones .",
    "however , even though qbcp is protected by these symmetries , it shows a fragility against electron - electron interactions since instabilities will develop for any non - vanishing interaction , resulting in the spontaneous breaking of the lattice symmetry or the trs .",
    "different from the general case in ref.@xcite , the qbcp considered here enjoys both the orbital and spin flavor .",
    "the orbital and spin degrees of freedom complicate the interactions by bringing about more channels , such as the inter- and intra - orbital couplings . in the following ,",
    "we study the case where the screening effect is significant and focus on the short - ranged interactions between electrons , as described by the following local model @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the intra - orbital and the inter - orbital scattering , respectively .",
    "the sum , @xmath29 , denotes  @xmath30 \" and the sum for repeated index is implied . in what follows",
    ", we consider the repulsive couplings with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "moreover , in order to extract the physics clearly , we have temporarily neglected the other two interactions @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which describe the scattering between electrons within the same orbital and the coupling process where two electrons are both scattered from one orbital to the other , respectively .",
    "the effect of these two more couplings will be calculated and discussed in detail in section .    besides the interactions , we are interested in the effect of a single magnetic impurity on the qbcp , which can be investigated using the kondo model . by adopting the pseudo fermion representation of the local magnetic moment , @xmath35 with the constraint @xmath36 and @xmath37 being the annihilation operator for the pseudo fermion ,",
    "the interaction between the local magnetic moment and the conduction electron is written as @xmath38 where @xmath2 is the s - d coupling constant .",
    "here we have assumed that the local moment is only coupled to one orbital .",
    "the coupling to both the two orbitals constitutes a two - channel kondo problem , which we left for future investigation .",
    "eq.(1)-(7 ) constitutes the main model we are interested in this work . since this model is essentially a combined problem of the kondo effect and the qbcp , we term it by the kondo - qbcp ( kqbcp ) model for the purpose of brevity .",
    "as is well known , for anti - ferromagnetic coupling @xmath39 ( which we consider ) , the rg analysis on the traditional kondo problem in metals shows two fixed points , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for a nonzero bare @xmath2",
    ", the renormalized coupling gets stronger and stronger when the temperature is lowered , and finally leads to the complete screening of the local magnetic moment , forming the well - known kondo singlet state .",
    "however , in the current case , due to the fragility of the qbcp , the interaction between electrons is also a marginally relevant operator , which may lead to various ground states with symmetry spontaneously broken .",
    "so , there exists two trends towards two different strong coupling limits in this model .",
    "the questions naturally arise as whether the two trends cooperate or compete with each other , and what is the most relevant order formed at low temperature . in this paper",
    ", we address these questions using the combined method of the perturbative rg and the mean - field theory .",
    "resorting to the functional path integral representation of the partition function @xmath42 @xcite , and introducing a lagrangian multiplier @xcite to enforce the number constraint condition of the pseudo fermions , we arrive at the imaginary - time action @xmath43 describing the kqbcp model , @xmath44\\\\    & -v_1\\int d\\tau \\prod^4_id^{\\prime}\\mathbf{k}_i\\psi^{\\dagger}_{s,1}(\\mathbf{k}_1)\\psi^{\\dagger}_{s^{\\prime},2}(\\mathbf{k}_2)\\psi_{s^{\\prime},2}(\\mathbf{k}_3)\\psi_{s,1}(\\mathbf{k}_4)\\\\ %   & -v_2\\int d\\tau \\prod^4_id^{\\prime}\\mathbf{k}_i\\psi^{\\dagger}_{s,\\alpha}(\\mathbf{k}_1)\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\overline{s},\\alpha}(\\mathbf{k}_2)\\psi_{\\overline{s},\\alpha}(\\mathbf{k}_3)\\psi_{s,\\alpha}(\\mathbf{k}_4)\\\\    & -v_3\\int d\\tau \\prod^4_id^{\\prime}\\mathbf{k}_i\\psi^{\\dagger}_{s,2}(\\mathbf{k}_1)\\psi^{\\dagger}_{s^{\\prime},1}(\\mathbf{k}_2)\\psi_{s^{\\prime},2}(\\mathbf{k}_3)\\psi_{s,1}(\\mathbf{k}_4)\\\\    & -g\\int d\\tau d\\mathbf{k}d\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime}\\psi^{\\dagger}_{s,1}(\\mathbf{k})\\psi_{s^{\\prime},1}(\\mathbf{k}^{\\prime})f^{\\dagger}_{s^{\\prime}}f_{s}. \\end{split}\\ ] ] for brevity , the dependence of @xmath45 on @xmath21 is implicit and the @xmath46 function enforcing the momentum conservation is not explicitly written but represented by  @xmath47 \" in the integral .",
    "we shall focus on the most interesting case where the fermi energy lies at the qbcp by setting the chemical potential of the electrons to zero@xcite .",
    "as one can see in the above equation , the lagrangian @xmath48 acts as the chemical potential of the pseudo fermions , which , as will be shown later , should be calculated self - consistently so that the pseudo fermion number condition is satisfied at the mean - field level .",
    "since the qbcp is the low - energy effective description of the tight - binding models @xcite , a cutoff @xmath49 is implied . as what rg does",
    ", one can decrease @xmath49 step by step to obtain the effective action with renormalized parameters for the coarse - grained model , integrating out the degree of freedom with the larger momentum .    through the standard rg analysis",
    ", one can find that the three coupling constants , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath2 are all marginal at tree level @xcite , therefore the perturbative rg to one - loop order needs to be performed . in order to do so , all the topologically distinct one - loop diagrams should be calculated , which can be classified into three different channels , i.e. , the @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the @xmath54 diagrams @xcite .",
    "moreover , a key point lies in the choice of basis . here",
    ", we perform the rg calculation in the @xmath55 basis ( see section ) , rather than the diagonalized basis of @xmath56 .",
    "this is important due to the following reasons .",
    "transforming @xmath56 to its diagonalized basis leads to the orbital make - ups in the interactions @xcite , which should not be neglected in order to keep the complete topological behavior of the qbcp .",
    "however , in rg sense , the high order expansion of @xmath57 of the orbital make - ups are irrelevant , only leaving a few constant bare couplings that are marginal at tree level @xcite .",
    "therefore , the perturbative rg treatment in the diagonalized basis can only present incomplete predictions of the leading instability . in comparison , even though it is much more complicated , the @xmath55 basis can avoid this problem . in this basis ,",
    "the green s functions of the non - interacting electrons are matrices , whose elements are @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "so , when treating the second order perturbation , one would encounter averages over the fast mode of the loop - momentum both in the particle - particle and in the particle - hole channel with different orbital flavors .",
    "we represent these averages by loops in feynman diagram .",
    "examples in both the particle - hole and the particle - particle channels are shown in fig.1 , where the dashed lines represent the fast modes . performing gaussian integrals in the diagrams , we obtain the results of all the averages ( over fast mode ) needed in the rg calculation , which are listed below ,",

    ". as is seen from above equations , only the inter - orbital interaction @xmath28 explicitly modifies @xmath2 .",
    "even though @xmath27 does not dress the flow of @xmath2 by itself , it is also essential since it will affect @xmath2 via the indirect modification on @xmath28 .",
    "the running of the coupling constants leads to the fixed points in the three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "several observations can be drawn from the above equation .",
    "first , when both the bare interactions @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and the bare kondo coupling @xmath69 are zero , the system always lies at the fixed point , @xmath70 , which stands for the initial non - interacting qbcp .",

    ", solving the flow equations numerically , we find an interesting renormalization flow of the interactions , which is plotted in fig.2 .",
    "as is shown , for generic bare interactions ( except for @xmath72 ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 always tend to diverge toward large positive and negative values respectively when the energy scale is gradually lowered , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "this renormalization behavior is very interesting since it will lead to a peculiar topological state when the magnetic moment is present ( see below ) , and therefore is our main focus in this work . in plotting fig.2",

    "based on the flow equation of the coupling constants , we can further determine what is the most relevant instability of the kqbcp model . to do so , we introduce test susceptibilities , _",

    "it is found that , for repulsive interactions , @xmath4 is much more dependent on @xmath68 than @xmath67 , and it decreases with the increase of @xmath68 .",

    "the red curve denotes the susceptibilities of the qah and the qsh states ( which are the same ) , the blue curve represents for susceptibilities of the ns and the nsn states , and the green curve describes the susceptibilities of the ns and the nsn phases .",

    "the complete screening of the local magnetic moment and the formation of the kondo - singlet are still likely to take place ( as long as @xmath69 is large enough ) even though the interaction is present , as is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the interaction can lower the kondo temperature and make the kondo - singlet more difficult to occur .",
    "besides the kondo - singlet , the leading instability is the qah and qsh states . on the other hand , problems still remain as following .",
    "can the kondo - singlet coexist with the symmetry - breaking phases ?",
    "which order is more likely to take place , the qah or the qsh ?",
    "this can not be answered by the above rg analysis since the rg method is unable to extract the energetics of the relevant states , which is necessary to determine which phases are more stable .",

    "this is the result of the renormalization of @xmath51 on @xmath2 ( see eq.(17 ) ) .",
    "second , since the mean - field order parameters undergo abrupt stepwise changes at @xmath10 , we conclude that a quantum phase transition takes place at this critical point .",

    ", we found in ref.@xcite that the nontrivial topological properties of qsh systems remain intact even when the trs is broken @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the trs leads to a small gap of the qsh edge . remarkably , even though a small gap is opened up , the trs - broken qsh is still topologically distinct from the trivial state , _",
    "i.e. _ , the edge states become quasi - helical and are robust as long as the bulk energy gap is not closed . in this phase",
    ", there is usually a weak scattering between forward and backward movers , as evidenced by the small energy gap in the edge state spectrum , leading to a low - dissipation spin transport .",
    "the trs - broken qsh phase has also been found in the @xmath108-doped @xmath109@xcite and in the spin - orbit coupled electron system with staggered magnetic fluxes @xcite , where the quasi - helical qsh edge state coexists with the chiral qah edge state on the sample edge .",
    "the hybrid topological insulator phase we predicted here enjoys the same bulk topology with that of ref.@xcite .",
    "the nonzero @xmath110 implies that the 2d electron system has an exactly quantized charge hall conductance due to the gapless chiral qah edge states , and the nonzero @xmath111 suggests that it exhibits a net transport of spin owing to the quasi - helical qsh edge state @xcite .",
    "in this section , we take into account the other two local scattering processes , which are described by the following interactions @xmath112 here @xmath33 denotes the coupling between electrons from the same orbital and @xmath34 describes the interaction process where two electrons are scattered from one orbital to the other .",
    "the corrections from these two vertices will lead to new renormalization flow of the coupling constants .",
    "following the same perturbative rg approach as before , we obtain the coupled flow equations in the five - dimensional parameter space , which reads @xmath113 the new rg flows describing the renormalization of the interactions for small values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 can be solved numerically .",
    "it is found that , in the regime where the perturbative rg method is applicable , the small perturbations due to @xmath33 and @xmath34 do not affect the renormalization of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , whose flow show quite similar trends as indicated in fig.2 , i.e. , @xmath50 and @xmath51 couplings are always dressed to large positive and negative values , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are renormalized to negligible values compared to @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ". therefore , it suggests that as long as the bare value of @xmath116 and @xmath117 is not too large , their renormalization do not have any qualitative consequence on the above conclusions , i.e. , the same mean - field hamiltonian can be constructed in certain low energy window and therefore the hybrid topological insulator will take place when the kondo - coupling @xmath2 is larger than @xmath10 .",
    "when the values of the bare interaction @xmath114 and @xmath115 are larger so that they are comparable to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , their renormalization flows do not lead to negligible values . in this case , we have checked that @xmath116 also flows toward large negative value in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "as such , instead of the hybrid ti , the nematic phases in table would be the possible leading instability .",
    "we will leave the detailed discussion on this topic to further investigation .",
    "we have revisited the traditional kondo problem in the background of the recently discovered qbcp in two dimensional electron system .",
