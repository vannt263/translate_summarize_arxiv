    "the wide - field imaging macho project produced brightness curves for approximately 6.5 million stars ( alcock et al , 1999 ) , among which are brightness curves of 59 background quasars .",
    "an initial analysis of these ( schild , lovegrove and protopapas , 2009 ; paperi ) showed that these are well suited for systematic analysis because the magellanic clouds are circumpolar and the data do not suffer seasonal dropouts from when the quasar was too close to the sun .",
    "the initial analysis was inspired by the fact that the 25-year brightness record of the gravitationally lensed q0957 quasar had shown evidence of reverberation structure ( thomson and schild , 1997 ) , that was easily detected in autocorrelation . the brightness amplitudes were typically 0.2 mag and the reverberations were on time scales of several hundred days . because the pulse trains were frequently overlapping , it was difficult to recognize the pulse train from simple inspection .    in our paper",
    "i initial analysis we chose a single quasar , macho 13.5962.237 , and demonstrated that the structure found in autocorrelation was realized by averaging together multiple wave trains , and the wave trains showed multiple peaks as had been already inferred from q0957 , and interpreted successfully by schild ( 2005 ) as reverberations from the multiple surfaces that occur in the region of the dusty torus .",
    "such structure had already been inferred by elvis ( 2000 ) from a comprehensive analysis of a great wealth of published spectroscopic quasar data .",
    "a surprising discovery was that in addition to positive reverberations , in which an initial narrow brightening pulse is followed after approximately 80 days by several broader pulses , an almost equal number of @xmath0 initial pulses with comparable widths and lags were found .",
    "a key finding was that the uv - optical reverberations originate at the same radial distance as the dusty torus already inferred to exist from emission line and infrared continuum reverberation .",
    "the existence of luminous outer structure was also inferred from microlensing studies of quasars , where failure of the standard luminous accretion disc model of shakura and sunyanaev ( 1973 ; s - s ) to reproduce the observed microlensing in q2237 has been a persistent problem .",
    "the first attempt to simulate the q2237 microlensing with a s - s disc by wyithe , webster and turner ( 2001 ) produced a prediction for a large microlensing brightening event that was to occur in 2001 but never happened . in a next attempt , kochanek ( 2004 ) applied the model , but found that it could work only by seizing upon highly improbable intrinsic quasar brightening in coincidence with the microlensing .",
    "it was also noted that for expected cosmological velocities the inferred masses of the microlenses were sub - stellar , and like the wyithe simulation , it predicted ( fig 10 ) the existence of 2.5 magnitude microlensing events , which have never been observed .",
    "a final attempt to apply the model by eigenbrod et al ( 2008 ) encountered the same problems , and introduced a bias factor as a prior to force the calculation to fit the improving data set with stellar mass microlenses , but again predicted 2.5 magnitude microlensing events that have never been observed .    a successful simulation by vakulik et al ( 2007 ) abandoned the s - s disc model and simply allowed the calculation to find the size parameters describing the diameter of the microlensed inner structure , the masses of the microlenses , and the fraction of the total luminosity responsible for the observed brightness curves .",
    "these are the physical parameters to which the q2237 microlensing would be most sensitive .",
    "this objective simulation produced a successful fit to the data with no bias factors , and with events that were highly probable from a quasar having only 1/3 of its uv - optical continuum radiation originating in the central region , within 6 gravitational radii , and the remaining 2/3 in a larger outer structure .",
    "the model predicts smaller amplitude microlensing events as observed , and determines that for expected cosmological velocities the microlenses have planetary mass .",
    "it had previously been demonstrated by schild and vakulik ( 2003 ) that such a population of microlenses was necessary to explain the rapid microlensing seen in another lensed quasar , q0957 .",
    "additional microlensing results have hinted at extended uv - optical emission .",
    "analysis of quadruple - image lenses by pooley et al ( 2007 ) showed that the optical emission comes from a region approximately @xmath1 cm in radius , although this is ambiguous if the emitting region is an extended ring with inner radius and thickness dimensions , especially since this size was also inferred by slr06 from estimates of the ring thickness ( fig . 1 ; @xmath2 ) .",
    "microlensing of the emission line region of sdss 1004 + 4112 by richards et al ( 2004 ) demonstrated that the characteristic size of the emitting region must be of order @xmath3 , based upon the duration of an emission line microlensing event .",
    "we propose that the dusty torus , the broad - emission line region , the uv - optical continuum reverberation region , and the infrared reverberation region are all the same outer quasar structure . henceforth we simply refer to it as the dusty torus .",
    "the central radius to this structure is of order @xmath4 , its thickness parameter is @xmath5 , and the height of of the luminous ring above and below the accretion disc plane is @xmath6 . a cross - sectional view of the quasar with this picture",
    "is given as fig .",
    "1 of slr06 .",
    "the microlensing signature of such a structure has been simulated by schild & vakulik ( 2003 ) and by abajas et al ( 2007 ) .",
    "the preponderance of microlensing and reverberation evidence now supporting the dusty torus model of quasar structure now challenges the theoretical community .",
    "the dusty torus model was comprehensively discussed in 1993 , ( antonucci 1993 ) but as yet has no explanation in a standard model of quasar structure .",
    "however a model proposed to explain the existence of the different observed quasar spectral states ( radio loud - radio quiet ) offers a possibility . while the standard black hole structure model has a magnetic field originating in the accretion disc , the relationship of the accretion disk to the size and location of the dusty torus is not clear . on the other hand robertson and leiter ( 2006 ; slr06 ) have shown that a strong magnetic field anchored to a compact , highly red shifted , rotating central object called a magnetospheric eternally collapsing object ( meco ) is also a viable solution to the einstein - maxwell field equations .",
    "such an object would exhibit the effects of a co - rotation radius in the accretion disk to explain the observed quasar spectral states ( schild , leiter , and robertson , 2008 ; slr08 ) and the location of the dusty torus would be associated with magnetic reconnection effects generated by the twisting of the dipole field lines to into toroidal near the light cylinder .",
    "in addition such a model would be radiatively inefficient near the central object s surface as a relativistic effect of the large intrinsic redshift there .",
    "because our discovery that reverberation of the uv - optical continuum evidences important outer structure seriously challenges the standard black hole model , our report will focus on demonstrating that @xmath7 @xmath8 show evidence for such outer structure .",
    "we adopt the standard definition of quasars as luminous cosmological objects with a stellar appearance at 1 arcsec resolution , and broad blue - shifted emission lines .",
    "previous work ( slr 06 , 08 ) has made the connection that the reverberation radius is approximately the same as the central distance of the outer region originating the broad blue - shifted lines as an outflow wind . our conclusion that the elvis flow occurs where all quasars have reverberating luminous outer structure would seem to prove that such quasar structure is universal .",
    "our preliminary processing has followed the procedures of schild , lovegrove , and protopapas ( 2009 ; paper 1 ) .",
    "raw data from standard v and r filters was corrected for ccd defects by simple removal of any 5 sigma data points .",
    "the data records were rebinned into uniformly spaced super - bins , with the number of super - bins equal to the number of observations , and all data within such a super - bin averaged .",
    "super - bins containing no data were linearly interpolated over .",
    "since the original brightness records had typically 600 data points spread over 2600 nights , a typical super - bin has time resolution of 4 observers days .",
    "the timing of these observations was then rescaled for cosmological redshift . for the highest - redshift object in the survey , macho 208.15799.1085 at z = 2.77 there is insufficient observing time to produce more than one full reverberation pattern in quasar proper time .",
    "therefore , we have excluded the source from further processing or plotting .",
    "for this reason our original sample of 59 quasars less 3 radio loud objects reduces to a sample of 55 radio quiet objects .    in paper",
    "i a quasi - periodicity with amplitude of 30 % was found in some but not all quasars .",
    "this variability has been called `` red - noise '' in some contexts , but it is well observed and real and in need of explanation , but we defer its further discussion .",
    "we remove this signature by forming a 300-day running boxcar smoothing algorithm over the binned and interpolated brightness record .",
    "an example of this procedure for macho quasar 13.5962.237 is given as fig . 1 of paper i.    following this preprocessing we have computed the autocorrelation function separately for the v and r filter data .",
    "the autocorrelation function always shows important structure , with a strong central peak having a brightness amplitude of order @xmath9 and lags up to approximately 50 days , followed by a 100-day string of lags with negative autocorrelation , and then several positive autocorrelation peaks with only 10 % autocorrelation amplitude . in paper 1",
    "we have shown from a noise simulation that the peaks are real , since a realisitc noise simulation shows noise that occurs on time scales of our super - pixel resolution , approximately 4 observer s days , but which we do not see in our real data .",
    "we also show in paper i that the autocorrelation peaks are confirmed to be real brightness enhancements with a reverberation pattern because we can co - add data segments containing the pattern and directly find a repeating wave form in brightness that confirms the autocorrelation pattern .    throughout this series of papers we presume that any structure found in brightness records for lag @xmath10 reflects quasar structure on size scale @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , we presume that the brightness features are caused by structure excited in the central region and propagating outward at the speed of light .",
    "1 we show a plot of the lag of the first minimum of the autocorrelation function separately for the v - filter and r - filter data . as a function of this we plot the ( anti-)correlation amplitude . based upon the theoretical error bars associated with the autocorrelation function , we see that the formal errors are comparable to the symbol size .",
    "we find in fig .",
    "1 that all the points lie in the lag range 30 - 260 days .",
    "the anti - correlation amplitude is between 0 and -0.5 .",
    "the points scatter around this delimited area , with no trend evident . for a typical quasar with an anticorrelation peak lag of 100 days and an anticorrelation peak of -.25",
    ", we infer that significant anticorrelation exists and that an upper limit to the size of the excited central structure is 100 light days , or @xmath12 .        in this context the siginificant result of our research",
    "was the finding that the radio quiet macho quasars are quite homogenous in their observed physical properties .",
    "it appears that the inner structures of these radio quiet are very similar .",
    "our paper i analysis of a single quasar , macho 13.5962.237 , showed that the pulse trains originating at the elvis surfaces could be recognized in the autocorrelation function and also in the wave train averaged from many data segments averaged together in a rebinning that fixes the starting point of each pulse sequence .",
    "this starting pulse is in principle easy to recognize , but in practice difficult to identify because the pulse sequences overlap .",
    "therefore for paper i we created the mean brightness profile from the ten most well - defined peaks ( well - defined meaning having both relatively large amplitude and narrow width and also being resolved from the neighbouring peaks ) in the brightness record .",
    "this mean profile was then inspected and had reverberation structure identified .",
    "we undertook this process of hand fitting for an additional 29 quasars , which were selected as the ones with the most complete data records .",
    "for all of the 29 carefully studied quasars , we found that the pulse trains seen were the same as the structure indicated by a simple autocorrelation .",
    "however we were uncomfortable about the hand fitting and piecemeal selection of the data , and therefore we devised a comprehensive machine processing procedure to automate it by analyzing only the autocorrelation function .",
    "all of the results reported herein were obtained from the automatic machine processing .    the expected quasar reverberation pattern illustrated as fig .",
    "2 of paper 1 shows that there will be 3 complications .",
    "the first is that the pattern of reverberation at the quasar depends in a complicated way on the orientation , such that the second reverberation peak measured would be from the same hemisphere of the quasar for quasars seen nearly pole - on , but from the opposite hemisphere for quasars seen nearly equator - on .",
    "this is why the equations for the reverberation pattern originally presented in schild ( 2005 ) included a `` case 1 '' and `` case 2 '' . in our present treatment",
    ", we simply compute the lags for the four surfaces independent of viewing angle , and so the role of the two cases reverses for inclinations above @xmath13 degrees , where @xmath14 is the internal structure variable defined in schild ( 2005 ) as the angle between the accretion disc plane and the brightest parts of the luminous regions of the elvis surfaces .",
    "a second complication arises from consideration of slp09 fig.2 lower panel , where the pulse trains expected are shown .",
    "it is obvious from simple inspection that a train with four pulses will not always be observed , because at the extreme angles of 0 and 90 degrees and also at @xmath15 degrees , several of the pulses merge pairwise .",
    "therefore we should expect some quasars to be found with either 2 , 3 , or 4 reverberation pulses after the initial pulse .",
    "we will call this the pulse merging problem .",
    "finally , we see in the figure that for small quasar viewing angles , the measured value of the viewing angle will be poorly determined because it is a weak , slowly varying function of the pulse lags , and because of the pulse merging problem .    therefore the process of machine - computing of the inclination angle was undertaken as follows .",
    "first we identified the 27 quasars for which the full pulse train of four pulses was found , and computed inclination angles for them .",
    "we noticed that the radius parameter can be easily calculated by adding the 4 lags together and dividing by four . from the equations for the lags given in slp09",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath16 , the radius to the broad line region , and hence the fundamental size scale of the quasar .",
    "this allows us to rescale all of the reverberations as fractions of @xmath17 , so that these fractional lags would be the same for all the quasars having the same inclination .",
    "then from the equations for @xmath18-@xmath19 with @xmath17 known , we can compute values for inclination angle @xmath20 and internal structure variable @xmath14 .",
    "the average of the two estimates for each angle and their rms deviation give a mean value of the angle and an error statistic , which we consistently quote as 1-@xmath21 errors .",
    "for the quasars with only 3 measured reverberation peaks , we initially assumed that the pulse merging problem causes the missing lag , and determined the inclination angle the same way except we assume that @xmath22 and @xmath23 have merged , thus forcing @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the quasars with only 2 peaks were presumed to be double - merger products , and because of the complication of attempting to locate the centroid of the two peaks which will probably be asymmetrical , we have simply entered the inclination angle as 90 degrees in our table .",
    "this procedure was followed for all the quasars , and for the v and r data separately . to give some sense of how well our inclination angle measurement worked , we list both estimates in our table 1 . in this table",
    "we list the macho i d , redshift z , number of v and r observations ( n(v ) and n(r ) ) , mean v and r apparent magnitudes , our estimated @xmath17 , estimated viewing angle @xmath20 , and the internal structure variable @xmath14 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     a further complication is that for a few quasars , more than 4 peaks were found .",
    "our procedure to identify peaks begins with an autocorrelation estimate on the semi - periodicity corrected data , followed by a smoothing with a 50-day running - boxcar smoothing algorithm .",
    "all peaks having autocorrelation greater than 1% were tabulated for processing in the orientation angle measuring routine . for one quasar ,",
    "6 peaks were found in the v data and 5 in the r data .",
    "so one peak was eliminated from the sextuplet and another peak that was out of sequence was removed from both filter solutions . for an additional 6 quasars ,",
    "a fifth peak was found , but comparison of the v and r filter data identified the spurious peak .",
    "a final complication relates to the many quasars for which we determined an orientation angle of approximately 60 degrees . for 6 objects we found the pattern of equally spaced pulses corresponding to 60 degrees orientation , but this could result from an artifact in the autocorrelation function . recall that if a secondary pulse occurs in a data stream , the autocorellation produces a response at @xmath18 and @xmath22 but also at @xmath25 , though at lower amplitude because the initiating central pulse is always a factor 2 or 3 larger than the reverberations .",
    "thus we must presume that some of the autocorrelation peaks were biased toward @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 etc . and possibly a false peak created .",
    "as a further complication , these systematic problems arise for just that part of the quasar reverberation diagram where the inclination angle is a strong function of the first and second pulse locations , meaning that the calculation is very sensitive to small systematic errors .    for these regions , we have assumed that the angle determined for our machine processing is an upper limit to the actual inclination angle , though in our final results table we have entered the angles calculated .",
    "we plan to take this uncertainty into account in our final analysis of the measured inclination angle in the subsequent sections of this report .    for macho quasar 206.17057.388",
    "we find three autocorrelation peaks in the r - filter data but only one in the less complete v data .",
    "we conclude that the v - filter data are insufficient to give a solution and use only our solution from r data .",
    "2 is a plot showing our estimated inclination angles , @xmath20 as a function of the measured lags .",
    "the solid curves are the predictions for elvis outflow surfaces with an internal structure variable @xmath28 .",
    "the first reverberation peak is plotted with a plus symbol , the second with an asterisk , third with a diamond and fourth with a triangle .",
    "notice the strong agreement between the model s predictions and the observed reverberation patterns .",
    "in paper 1 we have already shown that for gaussian noise , a noise simulation can easily be distinguished from our actual quasar brightness records .",
    "however our present procedure that determines the inclination angles from autocorrelation peaks is essentially an extremely strong filter that can mimic autocorrelation peaks with separations approximately the same as found in our fig .",
    "2 .    for this reason we have performed a simulation for a red noise component that is related to brownian motion noise .",
    "we created 10 sets of 55 simulated quasars and with noise amplitude the same as our v and r filter quasar data .",
    "we found that the red noise simulations were qualitatively different in that they did not show consistently a pattern of reverberations like our macho quasar data .",
    "thus in our real quasar data , we did not find any quasars that did not have any significant reverberation structure , where significant is calculated on the basis of the basic autocorrelation statistic that the noise related to autocorrelation detection is proportional to @xmath29 where n is the number of data points in an individual brightness record .",
    "however in our simulated data , 17 % of brightness records showed no autocorrelation peaks .",
    "this mean value 17 had an rms deviation among the simulations of 6.3 so that an estimate of the mean and rms deviation is @xmath30 . in this way ,",
    "our real data with 0 autocorrelation failures is an 8 sigma departure from the simulations .",
    "we conclude that our procedures and results are not compatible with red noise ( brownian motion noise ) simulations .",
    "with reasonable inclination angles available we are in a position to look for other measured quasar properties that might be related to this angle of observation , since such correlations might give clues about the quasar s structure .",
    "we first plot in fig .",
    "3 the measured lag to the autocorrelation minimum ( the anti - correlation peak ) .",
    "the lag to this minimum is expected to be the full width of the primary pulse at its base ; this would be described as full width at profile base .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "3 that a significant correlation is evident . in the top two panels , we present the correlation of the observed lags ( in days ) with measured inclination , and in the bottom",
    "we show the lags normalized to the @xmath17 determined for the quasar for both filters .",
    "thus for the two bottom plots , the lags for the anti - correlation feature are divided by the lag of @xmath17 .",
    "the appearance of correlation is seen in all four plots .",
    "the existence of such a structure variable correlated with the inclination angle is an important indicator of the nature of the central structure .",
    "since a spherically symmetrical inner quasar structure should produce no angular dependence , given that the emitting region is presumed to be outside of the region where strong general relativistic beaming effects are expected , it may be immediately concluded from fig .",
    "3 that the inner luminous structure is not spherically symmetrical .",
    "this conclusion is compatible with the disc - jet inner structure model normally adopted .",
    "we presently understand the anti - correlation peak to be associated with the weak inter - pulse emission originating in a dark region of the accretion disc .",
    "such a dark region is expected to occur physically outside of the luminous accretion disc inner edge which would be located near 6 @xmath31 and was measured to be near @xmath32 ( vakulik et al , 2007 ) .",
    "this inner luminosity was also measured to be @xmath33 of the q2237 quasar s total .    for quasars seen nearly pole - on",
    ", the lag to the anti - correlation peak represents the lag when the initiating central pulse has passed and the reverberation pattern has not yet started .",
    "so the time lag to this minimum luminosity should be inclination sensitive , as observed .",
    "in fig . 1 we have already shown the lack of correlation between the amplitude of the maximum anti - correlation and its lag for the v and b data sets . do either of these quantities correlate with the measured inclination angle ?    in fig . 4 ( top ) we plot the amplitude of the anti - correlation peak as a function of inclination angle for the r and v data .",
    "no correlation is evident , and we have undertaken no further statistical tests .    also in fig 4 ( bottom ) we show the measured @xmath17 as a function of inclination angle . since the radius to the broad - line region should result from reverberation and not from observing angle , no correlation is expected , and none is found .",
    "however , an important conclusion may be drawn from this plot .",
    "effectively all of the measured @xmath17 values lie within the range 400 - 800 days in r and in range 350 - 700 days in v. ignoring the few extreme values , we conclude that all of the radio quiet macho quasars have broad line regions which are approximately the same size . a glance at fig .",
    "4 shows that the distribution of quasar sizes is centrally concentrated and approximately symmetrical , with a mean value of 545 days and a rms deviation of only 85 days .",
    "this implies that to an excellent approximation , any magnitude - limit selected quasar in the radio quiet state can be presumed to have a radius to its broad line region of @xmath34 days .",
    "finally we discuss the internal quasar structure variable @xmath14 , as defined in schild ( 2005 ) .",
    "this is defined as the angle between the accretion disc plane and the luminous portion of the elvis outflow surfaces , and is illustrated in fig . 1 of schild ( 2005 ) .",
    "previously we have determined this angle to be 13 degrees for q0957 ( schild , 2005 ) and also in q2237 ( slr08 ) .    with @xmath17 known for each quasar ,",
    "it is simple to compute @xmath14 from the 4 lag equations given in section 2 of paper 1 .",
    "we show the @xmath14 values for the v and r filter data in table 1 .",
    "the internal structure variable @xmath14 is best determined in the quasars at intermediate inclination because of complex profile blending effects at the extreme angles .",
    "thus we determine the mean structure angle for the 27 quasars with 4 reverberation peaks to be @xmath35 degrees ( 1 -@xmath36 error of the mean ) .",
    "we find that the mean value is satisfactorily close to the value of 13 degrees previously determined for q0957 ( slr06 ) and for q2237 ( slr08 ) .",
    "in this report we have shown , from the analysis of 55 radio - quiet macho quasars , that reverberation patterns in the brightness of their uv - optical continuum indicate the presence of a universal large - scale elliptical outflow structure , similar to that predicted by the elvis ( 2000 ) `` dusty torus '' model for quasars illuminated by their central regions . of course there might be other models that could cause the pattern of brightness fluctuations found .    while it may yet be argued that the autocorrelation features observed may be reproduced by some artificially tuned red - noise process",
    ", the fact that our simulations predict a 17% failure rate of red - noise to produce significant autocorrelation structure leads us to conclude that noise is a highly unlikely source of these patterns and that they are in fact real reverberation processes .",
    "the combined conclusions from paper 1 that reverberation peaks originating at the region of the elvis outflow structures can be identified from the autocorrelation function , and also can be seen by co - adding brightness record segments , suggests that they are real and easily recognized and studied .",
    "similar structure has been reported in the radio loud gravitationally lensed q0957 quasar by slr06 . since the broad blue - shifted high excitation spectrum is a characteristic of all quasars , and",
    "since it is now understood that the dusty torus with elvis outflow wind creates the emission lines , we expect the reverberation signature in brightness records to be present in radio loud quasars , and therefore to be a fundamental physical element of quasar structure that is easily studied with reverberation .",
    "the 55 radio quiet quasars in our sample showed a surprisingly small dispersion in the various structural properties of the radius of their broad line regions and of the polar opening angle of the outflow wind with respect to their polar axis .",
    "in particular we found that if a luminosity selected field quasar is observed to be in the radio quiet state , an average broad - line region of 545 light days size may be adopted for it , accurate to within a 50 % error .",
    "more importantly the average of the polar opening angle of the outflow wind ( the complementary angle to the internal structure variable @xmath14 of schild ( 2005 ) ) was found to be 78 degrees within a 3 degree variation .",
    "the very large 78 degree polar opening angles observed for the outflow winds in these quasars , which are similar to that seen for the centrally driven magnetic outflows seen in cataclysmic variables and young stellar objects , are difficult to explain in the context of standard black hole accretion disk models for quasars .",
    "although many readers may find it surprising that our observations of the 55 macho quasars show such small differences in inferred reverberation region size , related to the broad - line region structure , this result is not in contradiction currently known observations of the difference between quasars and agn .",
    "quasars have long been known to have very similar emission line spectra , and no elaborate system of quasar spectral classification has emerged from 50 years of quasar studies . this is to be contrasted to the case of agn which includes seyfert galaxies that probably evidence galaxy interactions which bring a great deal more complexity to study . for the seyferts , an elaborate classification system has in fact emerged . on the other hand quasars",
    "have long been recognized to have large differences in radio luminosity and high - energy x - ray emission , which have as yet not been closely associated with significant difference in their broad - line spectra .",

    "<S> fifty - nine quasars in the background of the magellanic clouds had brightness records monitored by the macho project during the years 1992 - 99 . because the circumpolar fields of these quasars had no seasonal sampling defects , their observation produced data sets well suited to further careful analysis . </S>",
    "<S> following a preliminary report wherein we showed the existence of reverberation in the data for one of the radio - quiet quasars in this group , we now show that similar reverberations have been seen in all of the 55 radio - quiet quasars with adequate data , making possible the determination of the quasar inclination to the observer s line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the reverberation signatures indicate the presence of large - scale elliptical outflow structures similar to that predicted by the elvis ( 2000 ) and `` dusty torus '' models of quasars , whose characteristic sizes vary within a surprisingly narrow range of scales . more importantly </S>",
    "<S> the observed opening angle relative to the polar axis of the universal elliptical outflow structure present was consistently found to be on the order of 78 degrees .    </S>",
