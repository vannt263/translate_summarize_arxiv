    "in recent years , a great deal of attention has been focused on the thermodynamics of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) black holes .",
    "one reason for this is the role of ads / cft duality @xcite , and in particular , witten interpretation of the hawking - page phase transition between thermal ads and asymptotically ads black hole as the confinement - deconfinment phases of the yang - mills theory defined on the asymptotic boundaries of the ads geometry @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of black holes may be modified in the presence of matter fields .",

    "the spherically symmetric solutions in einstein - born - infeld ( ebi ) gravity with or without a cosmological constant have been considered by many authors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamics of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) rotating solutions of ebi gravity .",
