    "the historical supernova sn1604 was observed and documented by johannes kepler @xcite . the supernova remnant ( snr ) resulting from the explosion was discovered in a targeted search using the 100-inch reflector on mt .",
    "wilson  in the expectation that the ejected masses would still be visible \" @xcite .",
    "kepler s snr ( g4.5 + 6.8 , hereafter kepler ) is located well away from the galactic plane , at a height of @xmath3 pc , where @xmath4 is the distance to the remnant in units of 5  kpc .",
    "it shows up as a well - defined shell with a radius of about @xmath5 pc in radio , x - ray @xcite and infrared 24@xmath6 m  band @xcite images .",
    "there is a pronounced asymmetry in the emission at these wavelengths , with the northern limb being much brighter than the southern limb .",
    "the contrast is more extreme in the optical , where filaments and knots extend across the northern and northwestern limb while the southern limb is not seen at all @xcite .",
    "the brightest optical emission is from a region in the northwest .",
    "spectra of this bright emission show radiative shock emission arising from material with densities @xmath7 of @xmath81000@xmath2@xcite .",
    "these densities are much higher than expected for the interstellar medium at the location of kepler , well off the plane of the galaxy , and therefore these measurements have been interpreted as evidence that the emitting gas is from the circumstellar medium ( csm ) of the supernova progenitor system @xcite .",
    "the supernova was classified as a type i by @xcite based on the reconstructed historical light curve , but that conclusion was called into question by @xcite , who found that the light curve was equally consistent with a type ii - l supernova .",
    "the presence of nitrogen - rich circumstellar material ( enhanced by @xmath80.5 dex ) appeared to favor a core - collapse origin .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that much of this nitrogen enhancement could arise simply from the galactic abundance gradient in the direction of kepler , almost directly toward the galactic center .",
    "its distance from the galactic plane and x - ray spectral results suggested that a type ia supernova was more likely .",
    "the debate over the supernova type was settled only with the analysis of a long ( 750  ksec ) _ chandra _ observation by @xcite . based primarily on the strong fe emission and lack of o emission from the ejecta",
    ", they confirmed that kepler was the result of a type ia supernova .",
    "more recently , @xcite reconfirmed the type ia origin for kepler based on the fe k - shell emission observed with _",
    "suzaku_.    in a few locations in kepler ,",
    "coincident with the bright radiative emission , @xcite detected oxygen emission and found solar o / fe abundance ratios , which they associated with the shocked csm .",
    "@xcite carried out a detailed analysis of the _ chandra _ data and found that the circumstellar material is primarily distributed around the bright north rim , but that substantial amounts of it are found projected near the center of the remnant .",
    "they follow @xcite in explaining the bright northern rim as due to material piled up by the northward motion of the progenitor system , and they explain the centrally - projected csm as a disk or torus of material seen edge - on .",
    "the confirmation of its type ia origin , and the presence of the csm imply that the progenitor system underwent significant mass loss prior to the explosion , and that the explosion most likely followed the single - degenerate scenario in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a non - degenerate companion , rather than the double - degenerate scenario in which two white dwarfs merge .",
    "based on the structure and properties of the shocked csm , several groups @xcite have modeled the progenitor system as a symbiotic binary , with the white dwarf accreting from an agb star . in this scenario ,",
    "the agb wind shapes the csm around the supernova .",
    "strong silicate features detected in _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectra of kepler provide observational support for an agb progenitor - companion as well @xcite .",
    "this companion , which should have survived the explosion , has so far not been discovered @xcite    the distance to kepler continues to be a matter of debate . using a kinematic model of the galaxy ,",
    "@xcite placed a lower limit of @xmath9  kpc based on an h  i absorption feature , and an independent upper limit of 6.4  kpc based on the lack of h  i absorption from a known cloud .",
    "our earlier work , described further below , used the proper motion of a balmer filament and an estimated shock velocity to derive @xmath10  kpc @xcite . in recent years , distances of either 4 or 5  kpc have been assumed in almost all the published literature on kepler .",
    "however , simulations that combine the evolution of ejecta and the csm seem to require that the distance be greater than 6  kpc if the explosion energy were @xmath11  ergs , the standard value for a type ia supernova @xcite ; a smaller distance to the remnant would require a sub - energetic type ia explosion .",
    "@xcite find that the amount of fe in the x - ray spectrum indicates a larger than normal explosion energy for kepler , which coupled with the csm density profile in their model requires that the remnant be at a distance of at least 7  kpc .",
    "optical hydrogen balmer filaments arise in regions just behind fast so - called non - radiative shock fronts where the pre - shock material is partly neutral .",
    "charge exchange between neutral hydrogen atoms , which are unaffected by the shock , and shock - heated protons results in a population of fast neutrals .",
    "some fraction of these atoms are excited and emit line photons before getting ionized @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "the post - shock gas has not had sufficient time to recombine and cool via the emission of collisionally excited forbidden lines , and therefore , the strongest optical line by far is balmer h@xmath12 .",
    "the h@xmath12 line thus has narrow and broad components arising from the neutrals at the pre - shock and post - shock gas temperatures , respectively .",
    "the width of the broad component is related to the shock velocity , albeit with various complications that have been examined recently @xcite .",
    "spectra of balmer filaments in kepler were obtained by @xcite and @xcite , providing shock velocity estimates for a few positions .",
    "proper motions of balmer filaments have been measured by @xcite , based on a comparison of a ground based image obtained in 1987 with one from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) obtained in 2003 .",
    "the low angular resolution of the ground based image and the crowded star field towards kepler permitted us to measure the motion only at two locations near each other along a single filament in the northwest . in this paper , we present improved proper motion measurements of many balmer filaments all around the snr , using a second epoch of high angular resolution hst data with the first epoch hst data obtained nearly 10 years earlier .",
    "these measurements are used to improve the distance estimate to kepler s snr .",
    "the second epoch observations and the procedure for aligning both epochs of images are described in  2 . a brief overview of the optical emission from kepler is given in  3 , and the proper motion measurements of the balmer filaments are presented in  4 .",
    "the results and their implications for our understanding of kepler s snr are discussed in  5 , and finally  6 contains a summary of the main results .",
    "kepler was observed with the hst wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) between july 1 and 3 , 2013 , as part of a cycle 20 guest observer program ( pid 12885 ) .",
    "observations were obtained in the uvis channel through the narrow band filters f656n ( 9870  s ) isolating h@xmath12 emission and f658n ( 3894  s ) isolating [ ]  @xmath136584 emission .",
    "exposures through the largely line - free f547 m filter were obtained and used for star alignment and astrometry .",
    "the images were centered on @xmath14 = 17:30:40.8 , @xmath1521:28:53.40 .",
    "the wfc3/uvis field of view , 162  @xmath16162  is sufficient to include most of the optical emission from the remnant ; only the eastern extremity of the northern limb , and the very faint filaments on the extreme western edge are outside the observed field of view .",
    "the observations were obtained using a standard dither and offset pattern in order to remove cosmic rays and hot pixels , fill in the chip gaps , and to completely sample the psfs .",
    "the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses were minimized using an appropriate post - flash for each exposure to reach a pedestal of 12 electrons .",
    "the data were processed using the drizzlepac software suite ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as provided by stsci .",
    "the exposures through each of the filters were corrected for cte losses and then combined using the astrodrizzle package .",
    "alignment of the images was done using the tweakreg routine along with custom sextractor star catalogs in each case . for images with a given filter , the rms residuals are typically less than 0.05 pixels . in order to provide an absolute world",
    "coordinate system ( wcs ) frame , the wfc3 f547 m was chosen as the reference filter and the drizzled image aligned to the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the best fit gave rms residuals of about 0.5 pixels ( 0.02 ) .",
    "the remaining wfc3 drizzled images were aligned with the f547 m image , and the rms residuals were about 0.05 pixels .",
    "the first epoch hst observations were obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) wide field camera and have been described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , they consist of observations obtained through the following filters - f502n ( [ ]  @xmath135007 ) , f658n ( h@xmath12 + [ ]  @xmath136584 ) , f660n ( [ ]  @xmath136584 ) and f550 m ( line - free continuum ) . the acs @xmath17 field of view is larger than the wfc3 field , and was oriented differently .",
    "also , the acs / wfc pixels are 0.05 .",
    "the initial step to bring the images from both epochs to a common frame was to align the acs f550 m image with the wfc3 f547 m reference image .",
    "then , the remaining acs images were aligned to the f550 m image . finally , the wcs solutions from the alignment procedures were propagated back using the tweakback routine and all images ( epoch 1 and 2 ) were drizzled to a common @xmath18 pix@xmath19 grid with a wfc3/uvis native pixel scale of 0.0396 , rectified to north up and east to the left . the images resulting from this final step",
    "are used in the figures , measurements and analyses presented in this paper .",

    "the @xmath20 field includes the entire remnant , and a near - complete shell is seen around its periphery .",

    "the acs image includes virtually all of the previously known optically emitting filaments and knots in kepler ( a few lie outside the field of view to the east - northeast and the west ) .",
    "the optical features consist of bright radiatively shocked knots that emit strongly in both h@xmath12 and [ ]  and fainter non - radiative filaments that emit h@xmath12 only .",
    "the radiative emission is strongest in the region labeled `` box 1 '' , where the blast wave is running into dense , clumpy circumstellar material .",
    "the fainter balmer filaments produced by non - radiative shocks running into the ism are seen along the northern rim .",

    "the rim is the shock created by an ejecta knot that has punched through the primary shock .",
    "the regions designated as `` wedge filaments '' and `` central knots '' contain emission from both radiative and non - radiative shocks .",

    "radiative shocks appear white or yellow , and stars appear white .",
    "[ fbox1 ] shows the region with the brightest radiative shocks .",
    "the edges to the knots and clumps appear red due to the much higher signal to noise of the acs data compared with the wfc3 data , and due to the scaling which has been chosen to show the faint features .",
    "the locations for measuring proper motions were chosen by eye , based on epoch 1 , epoch 2 and combined 3-color images . the primary criterion for",
    "the selection was that linear features are identifiable at both epochs and are translated more or less in a perpendicular direction between epochs . for the final list of positions measured , we required a section of the filament at least 10 pixels wide free of contamination by stars or radiative knots in both epochs .",
    "the direction of the cross - cuts was also chosen by eye , but using an idl routine where perpendicular lines were displayed and could be aligned with the filaments .",

    "the alignment of the stars are also evident in these plots .",
    "the profiles from the two epochs were cross - correlated for a range of lags within some reasonable range .",
    "the cross - correlation vs.  lag curve was fit by a quadratic , and the value of the lag corresponding to the cross - correlation minimum was taken to be the filament displacement .",
    "( the implementation was carried out using standard routines in idl . ) in order to check the error due to placement , we varied the angle of the cross - cuts by small amounts , and recalculated the lag minimizing the cross - correlation function and found that the measurements are accurate to about 0.5 pixels .",
    "the proper motions in units of /yr were determined from the measured displacement , using 0.0396 /pixel and an elapsed time of 9.85  yr between the two epochs .",
    "the uncertainty in the proper motion for individual measurements is about 0.002 /yr .",
    "the proper motions , along with other filament properties , are presented in table  [ tblpm ] .",
    "the first column is the filament label and the second gives the co - ordinates of the filament position in the epoch 1 acs f658n image .",
    "the third column gives the box widths ( in pixels ) along the filaments used in generating the cross - cuts .",
    "the fourth column contains the measured proper motions in /yr .",
    "the fifth and sixth columns contain the peak intensities and widths of the h@xmath12 filaments in the epoch 1 data .",
    "these values were obtained by fitting gaussians plus a linear background to the extracted profiles .",
    "the peak intensities in the table are in units of @xmath23 erg s@xmath1 @xmath24 arcsec@xmath25 .",
    "the data numbers ( @xmath26/s / pixel ) were converted to physical units by multiplying them by the inverse sensitivity , @xmath27 erg / cm@xmath19//@xmath26 and the filter width , 78.0  ( acs instrument handbook , table 5.1 ) , and dividing by the area of a pixel , @xmath29arcsec@xmath19 .",
    "an important caveat is that the values for the peak intensities are only approximate since the conversion assumes a constant flux across the filter and does not account for the shapes and radial velocities of the h@xmath12 line .",
    "most of the non - radiative shocks have widths ( fwhm ) of order 35 , but a few are as wide as 80 , and since about half the flux is in the broad component of the line , in these cases the filter profile may reduce the flux by up to 20% .",
    "one of the goals of measuring balmer filament proper motions is to combine them with independently determined shock velocities , for instance from h@xmath12 line widths @xcite , and calculate the distance to kepler . under the assumption that we are viewing a shock edge - on , and that the observed filament traces the shock front at both epochs , the distance is given by @xmath30    and in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will assume that this relationship is valid .",
    "the h@xmath12 line widths of balmer filaments have been measured in kepler by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both studies targeted two positions , one in the ne , near filaments 12 and 13 , and the other in the nw , near filaments 7 and 8 .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra with the slits running east to west , thereby cutting across the filaments .",
    "they reported fwhm values of @xmath31 km s@xmath1  for the broad h@xmath12 component at both locations .",
    "@xcite positioned the slits along the filaments , and estimated h@xmath12 broad component line widths of about 1620 km s@xmath1for the ne filament and 2330 km s@xmath1  for the nw filament .",
    "the significantly larger line width measured for the nw position by @xcite may be due to contamination of the line profile by emission from other filaments in this complex region .",
    "van adelsberg et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have used the h@xmath12 broad component width reported by @xcite to infer a shock velocity of @xmath32 km s@xmath1(see their table 1 ) . @xcite give a different relation between shock speed and h@xmath12 width , but the difference is only significant for higher shock speeds .    for a given distance to the remnant ,",
    "the shock velocity is proportional to the proper motion .",
    "the proper motions at positions 12 and 13 are the same  0.06 , and those at positions 7 and 8 are about 10% and 25% larger ( table  [ tblpm ] ) .",
    "thus , the shock velocities among the positions will have a corresponding dispersion , which in turn should be reflected in the broad component widths of the h@xmath12 emission .",
    "unfortunately , due to the relatively large error - bars in the spectra , the differences between the ne and nw filaments were not measurable , and in fact were reported to be the same value @xcite .",
    "therefore we are forced to make some assumption about which value of proper - motion corresponds best to the reported shock velocity .",
    "we assume that the shock velocity , 1589 km s@xmath1  applies to the average proper motion measured at the four positions , 7 , 8 , 12 and 13 , which equals 0.06575/yr . using these values we find d=5.1@xmath33  kpc , where the error intervals are based on the uncertainties quoted above for the shock velocity and the error on a single measurement of the proper motion , which is 0.002/yr ( see  4 ) .",
    "our newly derived distance to kepler is significantly higher than our earlier estimate @xcite , which was based on the proper motion measurement of the nw filament ( near positions 7 and 8 of this study ) .",
    "the difference is primarily due to the higher proper motion , @xmath34/yr , used in the earlier study compared to the value used here .",
    "the current measurement of the nw filament proper motion is @xmath35/yr , which is consistent ( within the errors ) with the earlier value .",
    "it is unlikely that the change in proper motion is due to deceleration of the filament .",
    "the decrease of the shock velocity by about 28% in 10 years would require an increase in the pre - shock density of about 65% in the same period .",
    "the gradient would have to be sufficiently smooth that the filament retains its linear morphology and does not show any significant changes in brightness .",
    "typically , density contrasts are likely to be more clumpy - as evidenced by the example discussed in  5.2.1 .",
    "the errors on the proper motion measurements reported in this paper are an order of magnitude lower than in the earlier study .",
    "furthermore , the shock velocity adopted here , about 4% lower than used in our earlier study , benefits from the recent theoretical calculations of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that our new value for the distance is more reliable than that obtained by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite pointed out that shocks in a clumpy medium are rippled and mostly oblique , and that the obliquity can affect the relationship between the shock proper motion and the h@xmath12 line width .",
    "their 3d hydrodynamic simulations indicated that the downstream temperatures as indicated by the h@xmath12 line widths are on average 24% below those expected from the proper motions , which is to say that the h@xmath12 line width is 11% lower than would be expected from the proper motion .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the effect of shock rippling on the h@xmath12 profiles could in principle be misleading in that shocks are typically spread over 3 to 5 cells , and the shock position must be chosen far enough back that the final temperature has been reached .",
    "however , @xcite have been careful to avoid such problems .",
    "the prediction that the shock speeds corresponding to the proper motion exceed those derived from the h@xmath12 line width is somewhat counter - intuitive , because energy conservation implies that the shock energy is converted to the sum of thermal energy and turbulent kinetic energy , and if both thermal and turbulent velocities are isotropic the relation between line width and shock speed must be the same as in a planar shock .",
    "@xcite attribute the lower line widths to anisotropic turbulence .",
    "another possibility is that the shock moves most rapidly through the low density regions and `` heals '' after it crosses a small high density region . in that case",
    ", the proper motion would correspond to the faster shock speed , while the h@xmath12 line width would be an average of high and low speeds .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the density contrast of a few percent expected in the ism at the relevant scales could produce as large an effect as reported by @xcite , but the irregularity of the shock surface and the presence of both radiative and non - radiative shocks indicate a very high level of density fluctuations in the csm of kepler . thus the effects of shock rippling should be much stronger than in remnants such as tycho or sn1006 .",
    "one estimate of the level of irregularity of the shock surface is the ratio of the thickness of a filament to its length . as seen in figure 2 , the straight segments of the filaments are typically 5  long , while the thicknesses listed in table 1 are about 0.2 , for typical ratios of 25 . by comparison ,",
    "the h@xmath12 filaments in the nw section of sn1006 have lengths of arcminutes and thicknesses of about 0.3 , for a ratio of over 200 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the filament thickness in sn1006 corresponds to the angular ionization length scale of h  i @xcite , while the angular ionization length scale in kepler is about 10 times smaller due to its higher densities , lower shock speeds and larger distance .",
    "therefore , the thickness of the sn1006 filaments is only an upper limit to the amplitude of shock ripples , while in kepler it may be due to either curvature on the scale of the filament length or to smaller scale rippling .",
    "we conclude that because of the strong density fluctuations in thefuther pre - shock medium of kepler s snr , care will be needed in using the proper motions and shock speeds from h@xmath12 profiles to obtain the distance .",
    "some handle on the effects of rippling can be obtained simply by looking at the scatter among distances derived from different filaments .",
    "we defer further analysis until we have a larger set of h@xmath12 line widths for the filaments whose proper motion we have measured .",
    "the distance of 5.1  kpc to kepler will be a modest overestimate if the shock velocity from the h@xmath12 line width is lower than that from proper motion .",
    "for a distance of 5.1  kpc the proper motion shock velocity is given by : @xmath36(/yr ) .",
    "the error of 0.5 pix in the measured displacement of the filaments translates to an error in the shock velocity of about 50 km s@xmath1 .",

    "this is consistent with the post - shock density of 42@xmath2  derived from ir spectroscopy by @xcite for a region in the northern part of the remnant ( within box 3 of this paper ) .",

    "there is evidence for hotter dust in these regions from isocam 1416@xmath6 m data @xcite and _ spitzer _  irs spectra @xcite .",
    "the higher dust temperatures indicate higher densities . since the shock velocities at positions 2 and 5 are typical , the brightness and higher densities suggest that the driving pressures are significantly higher than average at these locations .",

    "however , the flux at position 3 is almost 6 times higher than at position 4 .",
    "a straightforward explanation is that the neutral fraction in the dense clump is higher by a factor of 5 compared with its surroundings .",

    "the detailed structure of the region was revealed by our first epoch hst images @xcite as consisting of arc - shaped balmer dominated filaments tracing a shock front and trailing radiative knots due to rayleigh - taylor like instabilities . the clear correlation between the emitting structures in the x - ray and in h@xmath12 may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fejxha ] . the deep ( 750  ks exposure ) _ chandra _  data used for the image was analyzed by @xcite and @xcite who showed that the emission was from a knot of ejecta rather than a dense clump in the csm .    between epoch 1 and 2 ,",
    "the sharply defined filaments have become more diffuse .",
    "this is most clearly seen for ej4 ( fig .",

    "the extreme case of @xmath58 implies that @xmath59@xmath2 .",
    "the central knots comprise balmer dominated filaments due to non - radiative shocks and radiatively shocked knots interspersed among each other within a small area ( fig .",

    "the x - ray emission from the region correlates well with the h@xmath12 emission ( fig .",

    "this may be seen by comparing the x - ray image of the central knots region with that of the ne limb shown in fig .",
    "[ fejxha ] .",
    "both images have been scaled identically , and the redder appearance of the central knots is due primarily to oxygen lines , characteristic of the csm .",
    "the h@xmath12 emission morphology is complex , and although a number of changes between the two epochs are evident ( fig .",
    "[ fcentknots ] ) , unambiguously identifying filaments that trace the motion of shock fronts is difficult .",

    "the morphology suggests that the primary shock encountered an inward protrusion and wrapped around its sides , and the filaments are the tangencies of the shock front along the line of sight .",

    "the northern side is fainter still with a flux 0.36@xmath62erg",
    "s@xmath1 @xmath24 arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "the gradient along the southern side may be due to a density gradient .",
    "the difference between southern and northern sides is probably caused by the geometry of the wedge .",
    "one scenario that explains the contrast in brightness is that the northern shock front is inclined to the line of sight , and therefore the length through the emitting region is small .",
    "this would also imply that the proper motion shock speed is an underestimate of the true shock speed .",
    "the current data are not sufficient to distinguish between this and other possibilities .",

    "their model of sn ejecta with an exponential profile expanding into an azimuthally varying stellar wind results in a torus of shocked csm occupying the equatorial plane . in the context of this model ,",
    "the balmer filaments in the central knots region and the wedge filaments are shocks being driven into this torus .",
    "the shock velocity and h@xmath12 intensity measurements thus provide quantitative information that can constrain more detailed models of the shock - csm interaction in kepler s snr .",
    "we have presented hst images of kepler s snr obtained approximately ten years apart and measured the proper motion of the balmer filaments , which trace non - radiative shocks .",
    "this study represents a significant improvement over that of @xcite  in the current study 26 filament positions were accessible for measurement as compared with two in the earlier work , and the statistical errors on the measurements were reduced by an order of magnitude .",
    "we used the average proper motion for four filament positions and the shock velocity reported in the literature to obtain a distance of 5.1  kpc to kepler , which is about 30% higher than the value obtained by @xcite .",
    "the higher value reduces , but does not altogether eliminate , the tension between the distance obtained using balmer filament proper motions and that required by the sn / csm models of @xcite and @xcite , who required a distance greater than about 6  kpc .    using our derived value of the distance",
    ", we have calculated the proper motion shock velocities of the filaments .",
    "we have estimated the densities in the pre - shock gas from these velocities and the h@xmath12 fluxes of the filaments .",
    "the distribution of shock velocities and pre - shock densities have been discussed for three components : ( i ) the main shock along the remnant perimeter , ( ii ) the shock driven ahead of the ejecta knot , and ( iii ) the shocks near the center and in the projected interior of the remnant .",
