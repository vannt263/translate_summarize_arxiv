    "critical behavior of complex systems in the continuum is one of the central problems in statistical physics . for systems in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , consisting of particles of the same type",

    "* chapter 10 ) and the references therein .",
    "the case of particles of different types has been more extensively studied .",
    "the simplest model was proposed by widom and rowlinson @xcite for a potential with hard - core . in this model",
    ", there is an interaction only between particles of different types . for large activity ,",
    "the existence of phase transition for the model in @xcite was shown by ruelle @xcite .",
    "a natural modification of this model for the case of three or more different particle types is the potts model in the continuum . within this context ,",
    "lebowitz and lieb @xcite extended ruelle s result to the multi - types case and soft - core potentials .",
    "for a large class of potentials ( with or without soft - core ) , georgii and hggstrm @xcite established the phase transition .",
    "further activity in this area concerns a mean - field theory for the potts model in the continuum and , in particular , for the widom  rowlinson model , without hard - core , see @xcite for the most general case ( that is , two or more different types ) and @xcite ( for three or more different types ) .",
    "all these works deal with gibbs equilibrium states of continuous particle systems .",
    "another approach to study gibbs measures goes back to glauber and dobrushin and it consists in the analysis of the stochastic dynamics associated with these measures . in the continuous case ,",
    "an analogue of the glauber dynamics is a spatial birth - and - death process whose intensities imply the invariance of the dynamics with respect to a proper gibbs measure ( the so - called detailed balance conditions ) . for continuous particle systems of only one type , the corresponding non - equilibrium dynamics was recently intensively studied , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein . in this work",
    "we consider the corresponding glauber - type dynamics in the continuum , but for two different particle types . here",
    "we use the statistical markov evolution rather than the dynamics in the sense of trajectories . in other words",
    ", we study the dynamics in terms of states .",
    "this can be done using the language of correlation functions corresponding to the states or the language of the corresponding generating functionals .",
    "we construct this dynamics for the widom  rowlinson model and study its mesoscopic behavior under the so - called lebowitz ",
    "penrose scaling ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we exploit a technique based on the ovsjannikov theorem , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this allows us to derive rigorously the system of kinetic equations for the dynamics , which critical behavior reflects the phase transition phenomenon in the original microscopic dynamics .",
    "this scheme to derive the kinetic equations for markov evolutions in the continuum was proposed in @xcite and goes back to an approach well - known for the hamiltonian dynamics , see @xcite .",
    "another approach is based on minimizing some energy functionals , see e.g.  @xcite .    in section  [ section2 ]",
    "we briefly recall some notions of the analysis on one- and two - types configuration spaces .",
    "a more detailed explanation can be found in e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we introduce and study a generalization of generating functionals for two - types spaces as well . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we consider the dynamical widom  rowlinson model .",
    "we prove that the corresponding time evolution in terms of entire generating functionals exist in a scale of banach spaces , for a finite time interval ( theorem  [ theorem1 ] ) .",
    "section  [ section4 ] is devoted to the mesoscopic scaling in the lebowitz ",
    "penrose sense .",
    "we prove that the rescaled evolution of entire generating functionals converges strongly to the limiting time evolution ( theorem  [ theorem2 ] ) .",
    "the latter preserves exponential functionals ( theorem  [ reducedtokinetic ] ) , which corresponds to the propagation of the chaos principle for correlation functions , cf .  e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this allows to derive a system of kinetic equations  , which are non - linear and non - local ( they include convolutions of functions on @xmath0 , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we also prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the aforementioned system of equations ( theorem  [ theorem3 ] ) . in section  [ section5 ]",
    "we consider the same system but in the space - homogeneous case .",
    "even this simplest case reflects the dynamical phase transition , which is expected to occur in the original non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "namely , in theorem  [ th - homog - kinetic ] we prove that there is a critical value below of which the system of kinetic equations will have a unique stable equilibrium point . for higher values ,",
    "the system will have three equilibrium points : two of them are stable ( they correspond to the pure phases of the reversible gibbs measure ) and the third one is unstable ( it corresponds to the symmetric mixed phase ) .",
    "it is worth noting that at the critical point the system has a unique mixed equilibrium point ( saddle - node ) .",
    "therefore , there is a bifurcation in the system of the kinetic equations corresponding to the dynamical widom",
    " rowlinson model without hard - core .",
    "we note that the existence of such a critical value for the original ( equilibrium ) model was an open problem , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
