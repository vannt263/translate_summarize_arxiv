    "superconductivity in the cubic ( t@xmath4 symmetry ) heavy fermion ( hf ) skutterudite pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 with @xmath5=1.8 k has provoked great interest since it exhibits a number of characteristics that suggest the presence of nodes.@xcite however there is also a proposal that it is a conventional s - wave superconductor.@xcite the specific heat results@xcite indicate that firstly a low temperature power law behaviour and secondly the presence of two superconducting ( sc ) phases with two consecutive specific heat jumps at @xmath6=1.82 k and @xmath7=1.75 k somewhat similar to the observations in upt@xmath8 .",
    "more recent low temperature thermal conductivity results@xcite in the vortex state confirm i ) the presence of two superconducting a ( @xmath9 ) and b ( @xmath10 ) phases with different nodal structure , ii ) the presence of point nodes in both a ( @xmath11 t , @xmath12 ) and b ( @xmath13 t , @xmath12 ) phase .",
    "more specifically the thermal conductivity indicates the presence of four point nodes at * k*= ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) , ( -1,0,0 ) and ( 0,-1,0 ) ( in units of k@xmath14 ) in @xmath2 in the a - phase while in the b - phase the two point nodes are located at * k*= ( 0,1,0 ) and ( 0,-1,0 ) .",
    "present investigation also excludes a fully symmetric a- phase order parameter with additional point nodes along [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the presence of two sc phases is possibly connected with the vicinity of a field induced antiferroquadrupolar ordered phase above 4 t which is likely due to a level crossing of the tetrahedral cef states @xcite where one of the excited triplet @xmath15 states crosses the singlet ground state @xmath16 . in u - based unconventional hf superconductors an exchange of ( dipolar ) spin fluctuations in the itinerant 5f - electrons",
    "is frequently implied as the mechanism for unconventional sc pair formation . in the present case",
    "a new interesting possibility for pair formation is the exchange of inelastic quadrupolar @xmath16- @xmath15 fluctuations of the essentially localized 4f electrons of pr",
    ". since the afq critical field is of the same order of magnitude as the sc upper critical field of h@xmath17(0 ) = 2 t impeding cef level crossing as function of applied mangetic field will strongly affect the pair potential and may lead to a change of the sc gap symmetry .",
    "this does however not explain the origin of the zero field t@xmath18 splitting .",
    "details of this microscopic mechanism and its prefered gap symmetries are not clear , hence we have to consider possible order parameters compatible with the above node structure on a phenomenological basis . the gap function may be expanded in terms of basis functions @xmath19 which transform like representations @xmath20 of the crystal symmetry group ( i=1-d is the degeneracy index , the index l denoting the degree of @xmath20 is suppressed ) .",
    "so far there is no information from nmr knight shift or h@xmath17- pauli limiting whether pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 has spin singlet or triplet pairing , although recent @xmath21sr measurements@xcite seem to suggest the presence of condensate magnetic moments .",
    "only the singlet case will be considered here .",
    "the gap function should then be given by    @xmath22    where the form factor @xmath23 is normalized to one and @xmath24 is the temperature dependent maximum gap value . in the spirit of the landau theory only a _",
    "representation with the highest @xmath5 should be realized and for @xmath25 , the free energy may then be expanded in terms of possible invariants of the order parameter components@xcite @xmath26 which are determined by landau parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the node structure is then fixed by the specific symmetry class of @xmath24(*k * ) defined by the set of @xmath26 .",
    "however we are interested in the complementary temperature range @xmath12 relevant for magnetothermal conductivity experiments . in this regime landau expansion",
    "is unreliable .",
    "especially it is unjustified to assume that only a _ single _ representation @xmath20 will have appreciable amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ expand ] ) , one should expect that at low temperatures @xmath24(*k * ) will be a hybrid gap function , i.e. a superposition of basis functions belonging to a few favorable representations which have approximately equal @xmath29 .",
    "a striking realization of such a hybrid gap function has recently been found in the nonmagnetic borocarbide superconductor yni@xmath30b@xmath30c@xcite and possibly also in luni@xmath30b@xmath30c .",

    "microscopic model calculations@xcite show that this is possible for a wide variety of plausible pairing potentials .",
    "the case of a nodal hybrid order parameter is realized in yni@xmath30b@xmath30c to an astonishing accuracy .",
    "this is not yet clear for pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 but the nodal structure refered above can not be realized with gap functions corresponding only to a single t@xmath4-representation .",
    "experimental evidence from the field angle dependence of @xmath3 leads us to the following simple proposals for hybrid gap functions @xmath2=@xmath31 for pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 with four and two nodal points respectively :    @xmath34    both a- phase and b - phase are described by hybrid gap functions which are superpositions of three t@xmath4 representations .",
    "the b - phase gap function has lower symmetry and both are threefold degenerate .",
    "an alternative gap function for the a - phase of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 would be the same model of eq .",
    "( [ gap1 ] ) as used already for the borocarbides .",
    "in the normal state the estimated linear specific heat coefficient is@xcite @xmath35350 mj / mole k@xmath36 , considerably larger than the value obtained from the effective dhva masses ( m@xmath372.4 - 7.6 m).@xcite however in comparison with other pr - compounds both experiments support the hf character of pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 . we have calculated the quasiparticle dos n(e ) for the gap functions of a and b phase which determines the low temperature thermodynamics .",

    "furthermore the specific heat in the whole temperature region is calculated and given by fig .",
    "[ figtemp ] , where we have assumed phenomenologically the pairing interaction @xmath48 to be of the separable form @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 is found to be nearly independent of @xmath52 for each gap model .",
    "however for fixed v the obtained t@xmath18 values for a and b phase are quite different .",
    "we consider now thermodynamics in the vortex state and in the low temperature limit with @xmath53 where where @xmath54 is the ( isotropic ) fermi velocity and @xmath20 the quasiparticle scattering rate and @xmath55 is the typical magnetic energy .",
    "the field @xmath56 is applied in an arbitrary direction defined by polar and azimuthal angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively refered to a cubic [ 001 ] axis . in @xcite",
    "it has been established that the dominant effect of the magnetic field in nodal superconductors is the doppler shift in the quasiparticle spectrum introduced by the supercurrent around each vortex .",
    "a short derivation is also sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the low t limit",

    "the angular dependent specific heat is adequate to identify the point nodes in @xmath2 .",
    "recently a related experiment is reported for yni@xmath30b@xmath30c.@xcite the observed cusps in the angular dependence of @xmath69 clearly indicate the presence of point nodes along the tetragonal plane axes at ( 1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0 ) etc . ,",
    "which is fully consistent with thermal conductivity data @xcite .",
    "in order to compute the thermal conductivity , it is imperative to consider the effect of impurity scattering . as already discussed elsewhere",
    "the impurity scattering in `` s+g''- wave supercondutors is completely different from other nodal superconductors without s- wave component@xcite . since the unitary limit gives practically the same result as born limit , we can follow abrikosov and gorkov@xcite and we have    @xmath70    where @xmath71   and @xmath72",
    "are renormalized matsubara frequency and sc order parameter respectively . here",
    "a = @xmath73 and f= @xmath74-k@xmath75-k@xmath76 for a phase while a = @xmath77 and f=@xmath78-k@xmath76 for the b phase .",
    "first we consider h=0 . in the limit of small @xmath20",
    "it is shown that @xmath72= a@xmath24+@xmath20 which implies that a quasiparticle energy gap opens up immediately .",
    "these energy gaps are well approximated by @xmath79 .",
    "this leads to c@xmath80/@xmath81 t and @xmath82/t @xmath83 . therefore unlike d- wave superconductors there will be no universal heat conduction @xcite .",
    "the thermal conductivity vanishes exponentially when @xmath84 .    in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath71   in r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ ag ] ) have to be replaced by @xmath71-i*v  * @xmath85*q  * where * v  * @xmath85*q  * is the doppler shift .",
    "then for @xmath861 the quasiparticle damping c@xmath39=@xmath87 in a and b phase is given by    @xmath88    where x@xmath89 ( i = a , b ) are defined below eq .",
    "( [ dopp ] ) and b@xmath90 = 2 , b@xmath91 = 4 .",
    "a similar expansion in terms of x@xmath89 up to second order is used to obtain the thermal conductivity tensor :    @xmath92    where we have defined @xmath93 .",
    "the component @xmath94 may be obtained by replacing @xmath95 in @xmath96 .",
    "similarly for the b- phase we obtain    @xmath97    note that in @xmath96 and @xmath98 have no linear term in x@xmath89 and therefore do nt exhibit a @xmath99 behaviour . indeed eqs .",
    "( [ akap],[bkap ] ) reproduce the @xmath58 dependence of @xmath100 observed in @xcite . for @xmath101 cusps in @xmath102 at @xmath103 ( a phase ) and @xmath104 ( b phase ) are predicted in accordance with experiment . on the other hand",
    "the present theory predicts the @xmath99 dependence of @xmath102 while the data appear to be approximately linear in h. also when the heat current is parallel to a pair of nodal directions the dominant term is almost independent of h except for the @xmath105 term . also we have neglected the @xmath20 dependent terms completely due to t@xmath106 .",
    "however , in a more realistic situtation the inclusion of the scattering term is necessary .    in fig .",
    "[ figangi ] we show i@xmath47(@xmath107 ) which determines the @xmath107- dependence of specific heat and @xmath58- dependence of thermal conductivity @xmath102 for various fixed @xmath57 . for planar field",

    "if this is indeed the case , we can still reproduce the angular dependence of thermal conductivity as observed for both a - phase and b - phase , using a gap function @xmath110 which has the same modulus as eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) multiplied by a phase factor containing the azimuthal angle @xmath111 of * k*. this would then be a `` p+h '' wave gap instead of the `` s+g '' wave gap in eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) .",
    "alternative triplet gap functions have been proposed by @xcite . on the other hand , in this instance the impurity scattering is similar to d- wave superconductors .",
    "this gives a dominant term in @xmath102 proportional to h@xmath112 , which is also different from experiment @xcite . in principle ,",
    "field and temperature dependence and impurity dependence of the angular part of magnetothermal conductivity will allow to distinguish between singlet and triplet case .",
    "for this purpose more detailed experiments for at lower temperatures ( @xmath113 0.2 k ) are highly desirable .",
    "we present here a simple nodal hybrid gap function model for @xmath2which appears to describe many features of the angular dependent magnetothermal conductivity in the multiphase superconductor pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 . from the thermal conductivity",
    "we infer the presence of point nodes at * k*=(1,0,0 ) , ( 0,1,0),(-1,0,0 ) and ( 0,-1,0 ) in a - phase and at * k*=(0,1,0 ) and ( 0,-1,0 ) in b - phase .",
    "we have shown that the hybrid nature of the sc order parameter leads to a very unusual effect of impurities .",
    "already for arbitrary small scattering @xmath20 an energy gap opens immediately with related low temperature exponential behaviour of specific heat and thermal conductivity .",
