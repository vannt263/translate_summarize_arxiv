    "neutron stars with their very strong gravity can be very fast rotators .",
    "theoretical studies show that they could rotate at sub - millisecond periods , i.e. , at frequency @xmath01000 hz@xcite .",
    "the first millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 , rotating at @xmath1 hz@xcite , remained the most rapid one during 24 years after its detection . in january 2006 ,",
    "discovery of a more rapid pulsar j1748 - 2446ad rotating at @xmath2 hz was announced @xcite",
    ". however , such sub - khz frequencies are still too low to significantly affect the structure of neutron stars with @xmath3 @xcite . actually , they belong to a _ slow rotation _ regime , because their @xmath4 is significantly smaller than the mass shedding ( keplerian ) frequency @xmath5",
    ". effects of rotation on neutron star structure are then @xmath6 .",
    "rapid rotation regime for @xmath3 requires submillisecond pulsars with supra - khz frequencies @xmath7 hz .",
    "very recently kaaret et al.@xcite reported a discovery of oscillation frequency @xmath8 hz in an x - ray burst from the x - ray transient , xte j1739 - 285 . according to kaaret et",
    "al.@xcite `` this oscillation frequency suggests that xte j1739 - 285 contains the fastest rotating neutron star yet found '' .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first detection of a sub - millisecond pulsar ( discovery of a 0.5 ms pulsar in sn1987a remnant announced in january 1989 was withdrawn one year later ) .",
    "rotation at @xmath7 hz is sensitive to the stellar mass and to the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "hydrostatic , stationary configurations of neutron stars rotating at given rotation frequency @xmath4 form a one - parameter family , labeled by the central density .",
    "this family - a curve in the mass - equatorial radius plane - is limited by two instabilities . on the high central density side , it is instability with respect to axi - symmetric perturbations , making the star collapse into a kerr black hole .",
    "the low central density boundary results from the mass shedding from the equator . in the present paper",
    "we show how rotation at @xmath7 hz is sensitive to the eos , and what constraints on the eos of neutron stars result from future observations of stably rotating sub - millisecond pulsars .",
    "we studied the properties of fast rotating neutron stars for a broad set of the models of dense matter .",
    "the set of equations of state ( eoss ) considered in the paper is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : eos ] .",
    "out of ten eoss of neutron star matter , two were chosen to represent a soft ( bpal12 ) and stiff ( gn3 ) extreme case .",
    "these two extreme eoss should not be considered as `` realistic '' , but they are used just to `` bound '' the neutron star models from the soft and the stiff side .",
    "we consider four eoss based on realistic models involving only nucleons ( fps , bbb2 , dh , apr ) , and four eoss softened at high density either by the appearance of hyperons ( gnh3 , bgn1h1 ) , or a phase transition ( gmgsm , gmgsp ) .",
    "the softening of the matter in latter case is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] at pressure @xmath9 .",
    "eoss gmgsp and gmgsm describe nucleon matter with a first order phase transition due to kaon condensation . in both cases",
    "the hadronic lagrangian is the same .",
    "however , to get gmgsp we assumed that the phase transition takes place between two pure phases and is accompanied by a density jump . assuming on the contrary that the transition occurs via a mixed state of two phases , we get eos gmgsm .",
    "this last situation prevails when the surface tension between the two phases is below a certain critical value .",
    "the stationary configurations of rigidly rotating neutron stars have been computed in the framework of general relativity by solving the einstein equations for stationary axi - symmetric spacetime@xcite .",
    "the numerical computations have been performed using the lorene / codes / rot_star / rotstar code from the lorene library ( http://www.lorene.obspm.fr ) .",
    "one - parameter families of stationary 2-d configurations were calculated for ten eoss of neutron - star matter , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] .    stability with respect to the mass - shedding from the equator implies that at a given gravitational mass @xmath10 the circumferential equatorial radius @xmath11 should be smaller than @xmath12 which corresponds to the mass shedding ( keplerian ) limit . the value of @xmath12 results from the condition that the frequency of a test particle at circular equatorial orbit of radius @xmath12 just above the equator of the _ actual rotating star _ is equal to the rotational frequency of the star .",
    "this condition sets the bound on our rotating configurations from the right side on @xmath13 plane ( the highest radius and the lowest central density ) .",
    "the limit for most compact stars ( the lowest radius and the highest central density ) is set by the onset of instability with respect to the axisymmetric oscillations defined by the condition : @xmath14 for stable configurations we have : @xmath15",
    "in this section we present the parameters of the stellar configurations rotating at frequency 1122  hz . for details and discussion see bejger et al .",
    "( 2007)@xcite    it is interesting that the relation between the calculated values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the `` mass shedding point '' is extremely well approximated by the formula for the orbital frequency for a test particle orbiting at @xmath16 in the schwarzschild space - time of a _ spherical mass _ @xmath10 ( which can be replaced by a point mass @xmath10 at @xmath17 ) .",
    "we denote the orbital frequency of such a test particle by @xmath18 .",
    "the formula giving the locus of points satisfying @xmath19hz , represented by a dash line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr - ns ] , is @xmath20 this formula for the schwarzschild metric coincides with that obtained in newtonian gravity for a point mass @xmath10 .",
    "it passes through ( or extremely close to ) the open circles denoting the actual mass shedding ( keplerian ) configurations .",
    "this is quite remarkable in view of rapid rotation and strong flattening of neutron star at the mass - shedding point .",
    "equation ( [ eq : f - orb.1122hz ] ) implies @xmath21",
    "in this section we present results for neutron stars rotating at submillisecond periods for a broad range of frequencies ( 1000 - 1600 hz )    in fig.[fig : mrsubms ] we presented mass vs radius relation for very fast rotating neutron stars . as we see",
    "the shape of the @xmath22 curves is more and more flat as rotational frequency increases .",
    "for @xmath23 the curves @xmath22 are almost horizontal and the mass for each eos is quite well defined and curves for different models of dense matter are typically well separated . in principle",
    "this property could be used for selecting `` true eos '' if we detect a very rapid pulsar and are able to estimate its mass .    in each panel",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to the formula ( of which eq.(3 ) is a special case for @xmath8 hz ) @xmath24 used for a given frequency ( 1000  hz , 1200  hz , 1400  hz , 1600  hz ) .",
    "as we see this formula works perfectly in very broad range of rotational frequencies ( recently this formula has been tested by krastev et al.@xcite for the frequency 716  hz . )",
    "we studied the mechanism of the spin - up of neutron star due to the accretion from the last stable orbit ( the innermost stable circular orbit - isco ) .",
    "as an example e discuss this subject for dh eos .",
    "we calculate the spin - up following the prescription given by zdunik et al.@xcite .",
    "the value of specific angular momentum per unit baryon mass of a particle orbiting the neutron star at the isco , @xmath25 , is calculated by solving exact equations of the orbital motion of a particle in the space - time produced by a rotating neutron star , given in appendix a of zdunik et al.@xcite .",
    "accretion of an infinitesimal amount of baryon mass @xmath26 onto a rotating neutron star is assumed to lead to a new quasi stationary rigidly rotating configuration of mass @xmath27 and angular momentum @xmath28 , with @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the fraction of the angular momentum of the matter element transferred to the star .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath31 is assumed to be lost via radiation or other dissipative processes .",
    "we present results for two choices of @xmath30 : @xmath32 and @xmath33 when all or half of the angular momentum of the accreting matter is transferred to the star from the isco . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr1400 ] we plot the curve @xmath13 corresponding to the frequency of rotation @xmath34  hz for dh eos .",
    "point f on this curve corresponds to the onset of instability with respect to axi - symmetric oscillations ( condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ax - sym.stab.line ] ) ) .",
    "point e is the keplerian configuration at frequency 1400 hz , and g - corresponds to maximum mass along the curve with fixed frequency .    the curves starting at points a , b , c and d are the track of the accreting neutron star defined by the eq .",
    "( [ eq : lms ] ) for @xmath32 ( solid line ) and @xmath33 ( dotted line ) for cases c , d and a , b respectively . to reach the configuration rotating at frequency 1400",
    "hz we have to start with the nonrotating neutron star between the points c and d ( if @xmath32 ) of a and b ( if @xmath33 ) as we see the actual frequency of rotation sets the limits on the initial mass of nonrotating star , which can be spun - up to this frequency due to the accretion . for @xmath34",
    "hz these limits in the case @xmath32 are : @xmath35 .    in fig",
    "[ fig : fmacc ] we plotted for dh eos these limits for the initial mass ( non - rotating ) of accreting ns provided that this star could be spun - up to the given frequency .",
    "we presented results for two assumed values of the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the shaded area shows the allowed initial masses of nonrotating star to reach by the accretion a given rotational frequency . left `` triangle ''",
    "corresponds to @xmath33 , the right shaded triangle ( with points c and d ) to @xmath32    the curves on the right represent the limits on the actual mass of rotating ns .",
    "the three curves correspond to the location of the three points e , f , g in fig [ fig : mrsubms ] .",
    "the curve with the point e ( green ) is defined by the keplerian frequency of rotating star , the point f ( and magenta line ) correspond to the boundary resulting from the instability with respect to axi - symmetric perturbations .",
    "the point g is the mass at the maximum point of the curve with fixed frequency ( 1400  hz ) . as the frequency increases the mass at keplerian point increases more rapidly than that defined by the onset of instability at the maximum mass ( points f and g respectively ) . for high frequencies the maximum mass of the stars rotating at fixed frequency",
    "is given by the value for keplerian configuration .",
    "for dh eos at frequency @xmath36  hz the point g disappears and for faster rotation the curve @xmath22 monotonically increases .",
    "the region of the masses of the stars rotating at high frequency is very narrow . for @xmath37",
    "hz it is smaller than @xmath38 ( see also discussion of fig.[fig : mrsubms ] )",
    "the @xmath22 curve for @xmath39 hz is flat .",
    "therefore , for given eos the mass of ns is quite well defined .",
    "conversely , measured mass of a ns rotating at @xmath39 hz will allow us to unveil the actual eos .",
    "the `` newtonian '' formula for the keplerian frequency works surprisingly well for precise 2-d simulations and sets a firm upper limit on @xmath11 for a given @xmath4 .",
    "finally , observation of @xmath40 hz sets stringent limits on the initial mass of the nonrotating star which was spun up to this frequency by accretion .",
