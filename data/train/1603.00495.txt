    "star formation in dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) is difficult to understand because gas densities are low , but this is particularly true in the outer parts where the gas densities are even lower than in the central regions .",
    "there , the standard 2-dimensional @xcite gravitational instability parameter for the gas , suggested by @xcite as an important parameter for star formation , predicts that the gas is highly stable against collapse into star - forming clouds @xcite .",
    "yet , @xmath0 emission , a signpost of recent star formation , is detected even into the outer disks .    in a deep - imaging study",
    ", we obtained @xmath8-band and _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath0 images of 4 dirr galaxies and one blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) , and @xmath9-band images for 3 of the dirrs @xcite . through surface photometry we traced stellar disks in these images to @xmath10 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "we found that the stellar surface brightness in both @xmath8 and @xmath0 continues exponentially as far out as we can measure ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of @xmath0 emission into the outer disk suggests a continuity of star formation with radius even though the outer gas is stable against two - dimensional gravitational collapse in the conventional model @xcite .    in spiral galaxies , numerical simulations",
    "show that spiral arms are capable of scattering stars into the outer disks @xcite , and this could be a significant source of the stellar populations there .",
    "however , dirrs do not have spiral arms .",
    "are outer disks of dirrs populated primarily through stars scattered from the inside out or from _ in situ _ star formation ?",
    "are the outer parts of dirrs from halos and not disks @xcite ? if star formation is taking place in the outer parts of dirrs , then there should be young @xmath0-bright star clusters , not just diffuse @xmath0 emission .",
    "we have previously identified clusters and associations to a radius of a few disk scale lengths @xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath0 images to search for young star clusters and ob associations in the far outer regions of a larger sample of nearby dirr galaxies .",
    "since scattering takes longer than the ages of young clusters and strong scattering may destroy clusters ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this search is a good test for _ in situ _ star formation in outer disks .",
    "we also examine the environments for star formation in the far outer parts of these galaxies (  [ environ ] ) .",
    "the pressure and average density are low , gravity is weak , and the dynamical time is long .",
    "most of the identified regions occur near the radius where the average gas surface density drops below @xmath11 pc@xmath6 , suggesting a cutoff or slowdown at lower densities .",
    "the gas and distributed stellar population go further than this . to test whether the outer disk might be built up from dispersed regions like those we observe , we compare in  [ outer ] the star formation rates ( sfrs ) in the @xmath0 regions to the average rates expected in the outer disks from the kennicutt - schmidt relation @xcite .",
    "the sample of galaxies is taken from little things ( local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes , the h@xmath4i  nearby galaxy survey , * ? ? ?",
    "this is a multi - wavelength survey of nearby ( @xmath12 mpc ) dirr galaxies and blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , which builds on the things project , whose emphasis was on nearby spirals @xcite .",
    "the galaxies and a few key parameters are listed in table [ tab - data ] .",
    "the galaxies haro 29 , haro 36 , mrk 178 , and viizw 403 , which appear at the end of the table , are classified as bcds .",
    "ngc 3738 , classified as a dirr , has characteristics , such as a central concentration of stars , star formation , and gas , that are similar to bcds , and so we will include it with the bcds when that group is singled out .    the little things sample was chosen to be relatively isolated because we are investigating internal processes of star formation .",
    "none of the galaxies are companions to large spiral galaxies , members of dense clusters , or obviously engaged in an interaction with another galaxy .",
    "most are , however , members of groups and so other galaxies are around . in addition",
    "a few galaxies and particularly the bcds ( ngc 1569 , ic 10 , haro 29 , haro 36 , mrk 178 , viizw 403 ) are undergoing bursts of star formation that may have been triggered by some sort of external process , including mergers @xcite .",
    "@xcite gives the nearest neighbor to each galaxy and their separation .",
    "the non - starburst little things galaxies are 110 - 1100 kpc from their nearest known neighbor , with a median separation of 480 kpc .",
    "the starburst sub - sample is at a comparable range of distances  240 - 900 kpc with a median separation of 450 kpc .",
    "therefore , we expect that for most of the galaxies the extra - galactic environment is not a factor in determining the extent of star - formation in the systems .",

    "the h@xmath4i  maps are irregular , as expected for the dirr morphology , and the @xmath0 regions are often associated with one of these irregularities , indicating the presence of a local gas concentration .",

    "these models trace the evolution of a @xmath27 m_@xmath2  cluster over time , assuming a @xcite stellar initial mass function from 0.1 to 100 m_@xmath2 .",

    "the ages are all less than 20 myrs .",
    "young ages are expected since the regions were selected to be bright knots of @xmath0 emission .",

    "eight of the galaxies in our sample were also analyzed by @xcite .",
    "working from the @xmath21 images , they identified , not just the furthest regions , but all of the discrete regions in the galaxies .",
    "the ensembles of clusters of these 8 galaxies extended to radii that were comparable to ours : 0.7 - 1.1 times the radii where we identified our furthest @xmath0 knots .",
    "their ensembles included older clusters , but the masses of our regions are within the range of the masses found by @xcite out at their furthest radius .",
    "the exceptions are ddo 70 and ddo 210 which have masses that are lower by a factor of 15 and 20 , respectively , in our study .",

    "the @xmath8-band surface brightness profile is flat to mildly increasing in brightness from the center to 0.7 kpc , and then the surface brightness drops like a normal exponential profile to a radius of 1.3 kpc @xcite .",
    "after that , as the surface brightness becomes fainter with radius , there are superposed up and down wiggles in the surface brightness profile @xcite .",

    "nevertheless , we expect bcds to be more centrally concentrated than normal dirrs , and their @xmath15  are roughly in agreement with that .",

    "the position angle of the optical major axis was determined from smoothed outer isophotes of the @xmath8-band images @xcite , and the h@xmath4i  kinematic major axis was determined from iterative fits to the bulk velocity field of the gas @xcite .",
    "twenty - six of the little things galaxies were in the study by @xcite and all but two are included in this study .",
    "we would expect these two position angles - one describing the stellar disk and one describing the gas disk  to be co - located , but over half of the little things galaxies have @xmath33pa that are larger than 20 . the large differences could represent some peculiarity of the galaxy structure . in figure [ fig - delpa ] we plot @xmath30  as a function of the difference in the position angles .",
    "we find that galaxies with large @xmath33pa are not distinguished in terms of @xmath30  compared to those with small @xmath33pa , although there is a decline in the upper envelope such that @xmath30  declines as @xmath33pa increases .",

    "the sfr is normalized to the area contained within one disk scale length .",
    "the thought here is that if a galaxy has a higher sfr , it might also have more extended star formation . in figure [ fig - sfr ]",

    "in addition , the galaxies with lowest sfrs have among the lower @xmath30  ratios",
    ". however , the galaxies in between these extremes display a range of sfrs and a range of @xmath30  without a clear trend .    to explore the relationship between the extent of the @xmath0 knots and the average gas densities at that radius , we plot @xmath30against the log of the azimuthally - averaged h@xmath4i  surface density @xmath36 @xcite at the radius of @xmath15 in figure [ fig - hi ] .",
    "there is no trend of @xmath30  with @xmath36 , but most points are centered around a value of 1 m_@xmath2pc@xmath6 .",
    "fifteen galaxies in the present study have outer star formation knots within the radial range of the survey of dirr in @xcite , for which we determined gas column densities , scale heights , midplane densities , and toomre @xmath37 values as a function of radius for gas and stars .",
    "the scale heights and densities came from solutions to the vertical equilibrium of a three component fluid consisting of gas , stars , and dark matter , using observed velocity dispersions and column densities .",
    "the @xmath37 values also included the observed rotation curves to give the epicyclic frequency .",
    "figures [ fig - hisgas ] and [ fig - hisstar ] show histograms of these quantities for gas and stars , respectively , at the radii of the @xmath0 knots . comparing the two figures , the average densities and column densities for the stars are much lower than for the gas at these radii , emphasizing that the @xmath0 knots are in gas - dominated regions .",
    "@xmath37 is high for both gas and stars , but higher for stars because of the lower stellar surface densities .",
    "the scale heights at these radii are about the same for the two components .",
    "the average environment at the radius of an @xmath0 region is important for understanding how the gas first got concentrated into a cloud to begin the process of star formation .",
    "h@xmath4iexcesses near the identified regions are sometimes directly evident as deformations in the h@xmath4icontours in figure [ fig - bw ] .",
    "almost all of the @xmath0 knots occur in larger - scale @xmath0 structures too .",
    "these large - scale structures typically have a size comparable to the disk scale length .",
    "their formation would presumably involve processes that operate on the local average dynamical time , which depends on the average midplane density . in these far - outer regions ,",
    "the average midplane density is typically 10 or more times lower than the gas density in the solar neighborhood ( which is about 1 @xmath38 ) as a result of both the low h@xmath4i  surface density and the large gas scale height from weak gravity ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hisgas ] ) .",
    "consequently , the dynamical time over the region that the star - forming gas came from was long : @xmath39 myr for midplane gas density @xmath40 at the typical value of @xmath41 @xmath38 . the free fall time is taken to be @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 g. this time is 20 times the average age of the knots , which is 7 myr from table 2 .",
    "unless there is a relatively dense layer of undetected molecular gas near the midplane or some triggering event like an extragalactic cloud impact , the formation of the observed knots by large - scale dynamical processes requires a relatively long time .",
    "this suggests there was a threshold density or column density for the cluster to form so the cloud could grow without early disruption from the first few stars .",
    "a threshold surface density for star formation in the outer parts of dirr galaxies is most likely not the same as that in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the pressures and metallicities in dirrs are much lower .",
    "the threshold column density for strong self - gravity in a cloud scales as the square root of the boundary pressure , with collapse proceeding exponentially slower as @xmath45 increases @xcite .",
    "with @xmath46 lower by a factor of 10 , the threshold column density for strong gravity in our case should be lower by a factor of about 3 .",
    "that would make it @xmath47 pc@xmath6 inside the star - forming region of a cloud , if we take the solar neighborhood threshold as @xmath48 pc@xmath6 from @xcite .",
    "another threshold involves opacity and the formation of strong coolants , like co. the opacity threshold , measured in terms of a mass column density threshold , scales inversely with metallicity , and the metallicities for these dirrs are lower than solar by a factor of about 8 . thus the mass column density for",
    "an opacity threshold should be 8 times larger in these dirrs than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "if @xmath49 mag is the local threshold for co formation @xcite , then the corresponding surface density of gas would be @xmath50 pc@xmath6 for the clouds that formed our @xmath0 knots .",
    "this is what we observe for co emission in the dirr wlm , where the metallicity has this value @xcite .",
    "if both strong self - gravity and high extinction are required for star formation , then the larger of these two thresholds should apply .",
    "however , if strong self - gravity alone is required and the opacity threshold automatically follows during the ensuing collapse , then only the lower threshold is required .",
    "this cloud threshold , @xmath51 pc@xmath6 , is a factor of @xmath52 larger than the average surface density of h@xmath4i  at the radius of the @xmath0 knots , which is @xmath53 pc@xmath6 from figures [ fig - hi ] and [ fig - hisgas ] .",
    "a factor of 13 increase in column density corresponds to a factor of @xmath54 contraction in two dimensions .",
    "this is about the same factor that clouds in the solar neighborhood would have to contract if the cloud threshold for star formation always scales with the square root of the ambient pressure . in this sense ,",
    "star formation in outer dirr disks may not be qualitatively different from other star formation .",
    "this picture of star formation at the local dynamical rate changes if a particular event was triggered by something rapid , such as an extragalactic cloud impact .",
    "some bcds and extremely low - metallicity dwarf galaxies have single dominant star - forming regions with lower metallicities than in the rest of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these regions could be the sites of extragalactic cloud impacts with low metallicities from nearly pristine gas .",
    "one example , kiso 5639 @xcite , has a star formation rate surface density in a @xmath55 pc region that is @xmath56 larger than the value expected from the kennicutt - schmidt relation at the likely gas surface density .",
    "the total young mass there is @xmath57 for a @xmath58 galaxy .",
    "these regions are all much larger and brighter than the @xmath0 regions studied here , which look more typical for disk galaxies , although they formed at extremely low gas densities .",
    "one of the motivations for the present study was to determine if star formation could account for the outer @xmath0 disks of dirr galaxies , as opposed to stellar scattering from the inner disk .",
    "here we compare the star formation rate inside each @xmath0 knot , obtained from the ratio of the knot mass to the age , to the total rate inside an annulus of width @xmath59 at the radius of the knot , as determined from the average kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) relation for dirrs at the local gas surface density @xcite .",
    "if the total rate in the small knot is comparable to the total rate expected from the gas in the annulus , which is based on large - scale averages from many other observations , then one might conclude that star - forming regions like these can generally populate outer disks .",
    "if the annular rate is much larger than the local rate , then either we are missing @xmath0 regions that are too small , faint , or dispersed to detect ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or the average ks relation over - estimates the star formation rate at and below a gas surface density of @xmath11 pc@xmath6 , where our @xmath0 regions begin to disappear .",
    "such an over - estimate would imply that star formation virtually stops below @xmath11 pc@xmath6 , according to our understanding of conventional processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case",
    ", stellar scattering from the inner disk would seem to be important in filling the outer disk with stars .",
    "the outer disks have relatively smooth exponential radial profiles in @xmath8-band down to @xmath60 pc@xmath35 or lower @xcite .",
    "this is below the average stellar surface density at the radius of the @xmath0 regions , as shown in figure [ fig - hisstar ] .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ fig - hissfr ] shows a histogram of star formation rates in the @xmath0 knots . there is a wide range of rates , primarily because the regions vary a lot in mass and age",
    "the middle panel shows a histogram of the ratio of the theoretical star formation rate in an annulus of width @xmath59 around a knot to the rate in the knot .",
    "the right - hand panel shows the ratio of the theoretical rate integrated from the knot radius to infinity compared to the knot rate .",
    "for the theory , we use the expression @xmath61 for h@xmath4i  surface density @xmath62 in @xmath63 pc@xmath6 .",
    "this implies that in the annulus , @xmath64 and for the integral @xmath65 the theoretical rate follows from the expression @xmath66 for a pure gas disk after substituting @xmath67 and @xmath68 inside the equation for free fall time given in the previous section , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "\\label{eq : tff}\\ ] ] the theoretical rate compares well with observations of 20 dirr galaxies if @xmath70 and the velocity dispersion is the observed value of @xmath71 km s@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "it also agrees with observations in the outer parts of spiral galaxies , which are gas - dominated like the dirrs @xcite .",
    "this is the steep part of the ks relation , beyond the main disks of spirals , where atoms dominate molecules , gas dominates stars , and the total consumption time approaches 100 gyrs @xcite . note that equation ( [ eq : tff ] ) gives @xmath72 myr for @xmath73 pc@xmath6 and @xmath74 km s@xmath35 , so the gas consumption time would be @xmath75 gyr with @xmath76 . for equation ( [ eq : int ] ) , we assume that the gas disk has an exponential radial profile with a scale length twice that of the @xmath8-band disk , as found for the 20 dirrs and for the outer parts of 23 blue spirals by @xcite .    the middle and right - hand panels in figure [ fig - hissfr ]",
    "suggest that the annuli around the knots and the outer disks would have @xmath77 larger star formation rates than the knots have now , given the ks relation for average rates extrapolated to the local average gas surface densities around the knots .",
    "figure [ fig - hissfr1 ] illustrates this point by plotting the two theoretical star formation rates for each knot location versus the knot s star formation rate .",
    "red dots are for the annulus and blue dots are for the outer disk . for the largest knots the two rates agree well , but for the smallest knots , the star formation rates fall short of the outer - disk expectations by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "as mentioned above , this shortfall could be because smaller , fainter and more dispersed regions can not be seen in our data , or because the sfr is actually below the extrapolated ks relation at @xmath11 pc@xmath6 .",
    "we have identified on _ galex _ images the furthest out distinct @xmath0 knot in the little things sample of dirr and bcd galaxies that we are confident belong to the galaxy .",
    "these knots are found at distances from the center of the galaxies of 1 to 8 disk scale lengths and have ages of @xmath1 myrs and masses of 20 m_@xmath2  to @xmath3 m_@xmath2 .",
    "the presence of young clusters in the outer disks of dwarf galaxies shows that dirrs do have _ in situ _ star formation taking place in their outer disks .",
    "most regions are found around an h@xmath4i  surface density of 1 m_@xmath2  pc@xmath6 , making this look like a threshold for the formation of prominent ob associations .",
    "the environments of these remote star - forming regions are extreme compared to the solar neighborhood and inner milky way (  [ environ ] ) , or even compared to the inner parts of dirr galaxies .",
    "the average pressures and midplane densities are lower by a factor of @xmath78 , the disks are relatively thick compared to the radial extents @xcite , and the metallicities are @xmath79 times lower .",
    "consequently , self - gravity is weak in the interstellar medium , cloud contraction times are long , @xmath80 myr or more , and molecules are sparse .",
    "moreover , the threshold column density for strong gravity inside clouds should be @xmath81 times lower than it is locally , placing this collapse threshold firmly in the optically thin regime where atomic gas should still dominate .",
    "presumably molecules form after the collapse begins @xcite .",
    "the star formation rates in the most remote @xmath0 knots fall short by a factor of @xmath79 of the average rates obtained from the kennicutt - schmidt relation for these types of regions . only for the most massive @xmath0 knots",
    "are the rates comparable .",
    "either we are missing other discrete star - forming regions owing to faintness or rapid dispersal , or the star formation rate drops below the ks relation for outer disks starting at around @xmath11 pc@xmath6 . in the latter case , stellar scattering from the inner disk would have to fill the outer disks with stars , which go out much further than the last @xmath0 knot seen here .",
