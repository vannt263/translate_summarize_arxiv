    "the detection of charged higgs bosons ( @xmath1 ) would unequivocally imply the existence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , since spin - less charged scalar states do not belong to its particle spectrum .",
    "singly charged higgs bosons appear in any two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , including a type - ii in presence of minimal supersymmetry ( susy ) , namely , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . depending on its mass , the machines that are likely to first discover such a state are tevatron @xmath2 ( @xmath3 tev ) and the lhc ( @xmath4 tev ) .",
    "current limits on the charged higgs boson mass are set by lep at about 80  gev . at the tevatron",
    "a charged higgs boson could be discovered for masses up to @xmath5 , whereas the lhc has a reach up to the tev scale , if @xmath6 is favourable ( i.e. , either large or small ) .    for the lhc , the atlas discovery potential of @xmath1 bosons in a general type - ii 2hdm or mssm ( prior to the results of this study ) is visualised in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] .",
    "( a similar cms plot , also including neutral higgs states , is given for comparison . ) the existence of a gap in coverage for @xmath7 was already denounced in refs .",
    "@xcite as being due to the fact that monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of @xmath1 production for @xmath8 were flawed by a wrong choice of the hard scattering process .",
    "in fact , for @xmath9 , the estimates in both plots in fig .  [",
    "fig : lhc ] were made by assuming as main production mode of @xmath1 scalars the decay of top ( anti)quarks produced via qcd in the annihilation of gluon - gluon and quark - antiquark pairs ( hence  by definition  the attainable higgs mass is strictly confined to the region @xmath10 ) .",
    "this should not be surprising ( the problem was also encountered by cms , see right - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] ) , since standard mc programs , such as pythia and  @xcite , have historically accounted for this process through the usual procedure of factorising the production mode , @xmath11 , times the decay one , @xmath12 , in the so - called narrow width approximation ( nwa ) @xcite .",
    "this description fails to correctly account for the production phenomenology of charged higgs bosons when their mass approaches or indeed exceeds that of the top - quark ( i.e. , falls in the so called ` threshold region ' ) .",
    "this is evident from the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : threshold ] .",
    "( the problem also occurs at tevatron , see right plot therein and refs .",
    "@xcite . ) as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , the use of the @xmath13 hard scattering process @xmath14 @xcite@xcite , in place of the ` factorisation ' procedure in nwa , is mandatory in the threshold region , as the former correctly keeps into account both effects of the finite width of the top quark and the presence of other @xmath1 production mechanisms , such as higgs - strahlung and @xmath15 fusion ( and relative interferences ) .",
    "the differences seen between the two descriptions in fig .  [ fig : threshold ] are independent of @xmath6 and also survive in , e.g. , @xmath16 and @xmath17 spectra @xcite .",
    "one more remark is in order , concerning the lhc plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : threshold ] .",
    "in fact , at the cern hadron collider , the above @xmath18 reaction is dominated by the @xmath19-initiated subprocesses , rather than by @xmath20-annihilation , as is the case at the tevatron .",
    "this means that a potential problem of double counting arises in the simulation of @xmath21 + c.c .",
    "events at the lhc , if one considers that higgs - strahlung can also be emulated through the @xmath22 process @xmath23 + c.c .",
    ", as was done in assessing the atlas ( and cms ) discovery reaches in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels for @xmath26 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is well understood , and prescriptions exist for combining the two , either through the subtraction of a common logarithmic term @xcite or by means of a cut in phase space @xcite .    if one then looks at the most promising ( and cleanest ) charged higgs boson decay channel , i.e. , @xmath0  @xcite , while using the @xmath27 + c.c .",
    "description and reconstructing the accompanying top quark hadronically , the prospects of @xmath1 detection should improve significantly for @xmath28 values close to @xmath29 , eventually leading to the closure of the mentioned gap .",
    "the @xmath18 description of the @xmath1 production dynamics ( as well as the spin correlations in @xmath30-decays usually exploited in the atlas @xmath0 analysis ) have been made available in version 6.4 @xcite of the   event generator ( the latter also through an interface to tauola @xcite ) , so that detailed simulations of @xmath1 signatures at both the tevatron and the lhc are now possible for the threshold region , including fragmentation / hadronisation and detector effects . in the next section",
    "we will discuss the details of an atlas analysis based on such tools that has lead to the closure of the mentioned gap through the discussed charged higgs decay channel .",
    "this analysis was initiated in the context of the 2003 les houches workshop .",
    "the signal @xmath31 and the major backgrounds , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are generated with herwig v6.4 in the default implementation except for cteq5l  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the detector is simulated with atlfast  @xcite .",
    "the tauola package  @xcite is used for the polarisation of the @xmath30-lepton .",
    "the selection of the final state requires a multi - jet trigger with a @xmath34-trigger :    ( 1 )  : :    we search for one hadronic @xmath30-jet , two    @xmath35-tagged jets and at least two light - jets , all with    @xmath36  gev .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath30-jet    and the @xmath35-tagged jets are required to be within the    tracking range of the atlas inner detector ,    @xmath37 .",
    "we assume a @xmath30-tagging    efficiency of 30% and a @xmath35-tagging efficiency of 60%(50% )    at low(high ) luminosity .",
    "the efficiency of this selection is at the    level of 1.31% for the signal ( e.g. , at    @xmath38  gev ) , 1.25% for    @xmath32 events and    @xmath39% for @xmath40+jets    events .",
    "( 2 )  : :    we reconstruct the invariant masses of pairs of light - jets ,    @xmath41 , and keep those consistent with the    @xmath40 mass : @xmath42  gev .",
    "the    associated top - quark is then reconstructed requiring    @xmath43  gev . for the signal with a charged    higgs mass of 170  gev ,",
    "0.68% of signal events pass this selection    criteria compared to 0.73% and @xmath44%    for the @xmath45 and @xmath40+jets    backgrounds , respectively .",
    "( 3 )  : :    we require that the transverse momentum of the @xmath30-jet    be greater than 100  gev , the transverse missing momentum be greater    than 100  gev and the azimuthal opening angle between the    @xmath30-jet and the missing momentum vector be greater than    one radian .",
    "indeed , in the signal , the @xmath30-lepton    originates from a scalar particle ( @xmath1 ) whereas in the    background the @xmath30-lepton comes from the decay of a    vector particle ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this difference reflects in the    polarisation state of the @xmath30 and leads to harder    @xmath30-jets in the signal compared to the backgrounds    @xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , to satisfy the large cut on the    transverse missing momentum and because the charged higgs is heavier    than the @xmath40-boson , a much larger boost is required    from the @xmath40- in the background than from the    @xmath1-boson in the signal . as a result ,",
    "the spectra of    the azimuthal opening angle between the @xmath30-jet and the    missing transverse momentum are different for signals and backgrounds ,    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_mt ] ( left plot ) .",
    "+    although the full invariant mass of the    @xmath46 system can not be reconstructed because    of the neutrino in the final state , the transverse mass ( which is    kinematically constrained to be below the @xmath40-mass in    the backgrounds and below the @xmath1-mass in the signal )    @xmath47}\\ ] ]    combines the benefits of both the polarisation effects and the    kinematic boost , thus providing a good discriminating observable , as    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle_mt ] ( right plot ) .",
    "( the residual background    under the signal is due to the experimental    @xmath48 resolution . ) ( 4 )  : :    we also apply a combination of other cuts on : the invariant mass and    the azimuthal opening angle of the @xmath49-jet system ,    where @xmath35-jet is here the remaining one after the    reconstruction of the top quark    ( @xmath50 100 gev and    @xmath51 radians ) ;    the invariant mass of the @xmath52 pair    ( @xmath53 gev ) and the transverse mass of    the @xmath49-jet system    ( @xmath54 gev ) .",
    "the cumulative effect    of these cuts is the reduction of the @xmath40+jets    background by more than one order of magnitude , while the signal    ( @xmath55 170  gev ) and the @xmath45    background are suppressed by only a factor of two .",
    "( 5 )  : :    finally , we require @xmath56 gev for the calculation of    the signal - to - background ratios and the signal significances in    tab .  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "this cut is very efficient against the    @xmath45 noise ( the efficiency is 0.06% for a    @xmath57 gev higgs signal , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the    @xmath45 and the @xmath40+jets backgrounds ,    respectively ) .",
    "the discovery contour in the transition region resulting from this new analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : newcon ] . notice that , at lower masses , the signal reconstruction efficiency decreases ( although the rate is higher ) , thus explaining the upward turn of the discovery reach .    before closing , some additional information is in order regarding the interplay between the new curve and the two old ones .",
    "in fact , recall that above the top - quark mass , the @xmath60 process , @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , was used while below it the charged higgs was searched for in top - quark decays , @xmath63 , counting the excess of @xmath30-leptons over the sm expectations .",
    "furthermore , in the analysis above the top - quark mass , cteq2l pdfs  @xcite were used and the charged higgs production cross sections were obtained from another generator , pythia v5.7 .",
    "these differences complicate the matching of the various contours at their boundaries , especially between the transition region and the high mass region ( @xmath64 ) . in the result shown",
    ", the normalisation cross sections for the transition region were matched to the pythia v5.7 numbers above @xmath29 , for consistency with the previous analysis of the high mass region  @xcite .",
    "a second stage of this analysis is currently underway to update all the discovery contours by adopting the same @xmath18 production process throughout .",
    "meanwhile , as _ ad interim _ conclusion , we would like to claim that the lhc discovery potential of charged higgs bosons has been extended further by our preliminary analysis .",
    "we would like to thank the 2003 les houches workshop organisers for their kind invitation .",
