    "sunspots are an obvious and significant manifestation of a solar magnetic field .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the structure of sunspot is essential to understand the magnetic activity of our star .",
    "however , the subsurface structure of these magnetic features is still an unsolved question in solar physics ; is it a single monolithic flux tube ( monolithic model ) as suggested by @xcite or rather a bundle of individual flux tubes like a spaghetti ( cluster model ) as proposed by @xcite ?",
    "observations by @xcite showed a significant absorption of @xmath0-and @xmath2-modes by sunspots . in monolithic sunspot model , the absorption is due to the conversion of the incoming acoustic @xmath2-modes into magnetoacoustic slow @xmath3-modes that propagate along the magnetic field lines @xcite . for the cluster sunspot model ,",
    "the absorption is caused by a multiple - scattering regime from the excitation of tube waves @xcite .",
    "a comparison between the scattered wave field of the two competing models shows a remarkable difference , which can be used to distinguish the structure of the model @xcite .",
    "we have to note that no gravitational stratification was considered in the models studied in the two latter references .",
    "@xcite used a semi - analytic method to examine the absorption of @xmath2-modes by a large collection of thin magnetic tubes ( plage ) in a stratified media .",
    "however , they did not take into account the scattering between tubes considering each tube isolated from the others .",
    "@xcite were the first to study analytically the multiple - scattering regime of pairs of flux tubes in a stratified atmosphere .",
    "they found that the scattering for the kink mode ( @xmath4 ) changes dramatically for small flux - tubes separations .",
    "they showed also a significant contribution of the near - field phenomenon on the scattering .",
    "@xcite used scattering formalism to investigate the interaction of the monopole component ( @xmath5 ) of acoustic @xmath2-modes with a thin magnetic fibril .",
    "they obtained that mode - mixing and absorption are weak for thin flux tubes .",
    "@xcite used the semi - analytical model of @xcite to incorporate the sausage mode in addition to the kink one , showing the importance contribution of the sausage mode on the scattering by the pair of tubes .",
    "they concluded that the absorption of sausage mode is a magnitude larger than that of the kink mode when the tubes are in a close proximity for the higher frequency of 5 mhz .",
    "@xcite extended the model of @xcite to study the scattering by a larger ensemble of thin magnetic flux tubes .",
    "they deducted that the absorption enhanced for a larger ensemble of tubes , or higher frequency .",
    "in addition , they noted that the spatial distribution of tubes affects the absorption at higher frequencies ( 5 mhz ) .",
    "numerical simulations of wave propagation through solar magnetic features provide an efficient and direct way to infer their structure by observing their helioseismic signatures .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated numerically the interaction of @xmath0-mode with an ensemble of flux tubes of different number and configuration .",
    "they found that the multiple - scattering affects strongly the absorption coefficients , showing that the sausage and kink modes are the dominant modes for the scattering .",
    "they noted also that the absorption generally increases with the number of flux tubes and the reduction of the distance between them .",
    "@xcite studied the helioseismic signatures of monolithic and spaghetti sunspot models , where the latter model contains a realistic number of tubes for the first time .",
    "they obtained that the mode - mixing from the monolithic model is more efficient than that of the spaghetti model .",
    "their simulations reveal also that the differences observed in the absorption coefficient for both models can be detected above the noise level .     at @xmath6 s.,width=302 ]    @xcite simulated the propagation of an @xmath0-mode wave packet centered at 3 mhz frequency through a hexagonal cluster of thin magnetic flux tubes , considering the effect of tubes configuration and the separation distance on the scattering .",
    "it was found that when the separation between two neighboring tubes within the cluster @xmath7 is about @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the wavelength of the incoming wave ) , individual tubes within the loose cluster start to scatter waves to nearby tubes which scatter again to a near field and so on leading to a greatly enhanced absorption measured in the far field ( multiple - scattering regime ) .",
    "we define a compact cluster as a bundle of magnetic flux tubes in a close - packed configuration .",
    "we have shown that a loose cluster in a multiple - scattering regime is a more efficient absorber of waves than a compact cluster or an equivalent monolithic tube of both clusters .    in the present study , unlike @xcite , we have fixed the distance @xmath7 as in compact cluster separation , and we have changed the wavelength @xmath9 of the incoming wave to see if the multiple - scattering regime can occurs for a cluster in a close - packed configuration as in the case of a loose cluster in the same regime .",
    "given this , an important question emerges : is the condition on @xmath7 ( cited above ) sufficient to have a multiple - scattering regime for the compact cluster or we have to add the condition that the cluster must be in a loose configuration to allow tubes to communicate through their near field .",
    "an important part of this work will try to answer this question .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s - simulations ]",
    "we briefly describe the code that we used and the set up of the simulations . in section [ s - identmsr ]",
    "we present the method of inspecting the multiple - scattering effects .",
    "sections [ s - smallspots ] and [ s - largespots ] outline the results of the interaction of a wave with small and large size models of sunspot respectively in a stratified atmosphere , including the effect of the frequency variation on the scattering for both cases . for more general results ,",
    "we compute in section [ scatc ] the scattering cross section for the different sunspot models .",
    "finally , the discussion and conclusions are presented in section [ concl ] .",
    "we have performed the simulations using the code @xcite which solves the linear and ideal mhd equations in a three - dimensional stratified atmosphere .",
    "a pseudo - spectral scheme is implemented in the horizontal directions and a two - steps lax - wendroff scheme in the vertical direction to evolve the horizontal fourier modes .",
    "the background atmosphere is an enhanced polytropic atmosphere described by @xcite .",
    "the horizontal extent of the computational domain is @xmath10 @xmath11 $ ] mm and @xmath12 @xmath11 $ ] mm .",
    "the depth @xmath13 is ranged from 0.2 mm to 6 mm below the solar surface .",
    "the spatial resolution for all simulations is 192 @xmath14 192 fourier modes in @xmath10-and @xmath12-directions , where it is 150 grid points in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "since @xmath0-mode interacts strongly with the sunspot compared to the @xmath2-mode @xcite , we propagate in all our simulations an @xmath0-mode wave packet with a gaussian envelope centered at the angular frequency @xmath15 mhz with a standard deviation of 1.18 mhz . each individual @xmath0-mode has an exponential dependance on depth @xmath13 with the frequency @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the horizontal wavenumber .    in subsection [ s - fsmallspots ] and [ s - flargespots ] we have studied the scattering using centered frequencies from @xmath18 mhz to @xmath19 mhz .    at @xmath20 ,",
    "the wave packet is situated at the left edge of the computational domain @xmath21 mm and it propagates from the left to the right in the @xmath10-direction .",
    "all waves of the @xmath0-mode are in phase at the initial position .",
    "a periodic boundary condition is imposed on the horizontal side walls of the simulation box .",
    "the upper condition plays an important role in the absorption and the scattering of @xmath0-modes . in our case",
    ", they correspond to that of a free - surface in the non - magnetic regions where waves are strongly reflected from the upper boundary @xcite .",
    "our initial condition has a very little energy in the range where it would escape ( @xmath22 0.06 % ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have modeled the interaction of @xmath0-and-@xmath2-modes with a random distribution of tubes .",
    "they have found that the absorption coefficients and the damping rates are very sensitive when a magnetic fibril is extended into an isothermal region above a polytrope .",
    "more recently , @xcite have extended the model of @xcite by allowing sausage and kink modes to freely escape at the top of model using a radiative boundary condition there .",
    "their results show an increase of the absorption coefficiens of the incoming @xmath0-wave for both modes in comparison to the absorption using a reflective stress - free condition at the top of tubes . our condition is not realistic since in the realistic one",
    ", waves can escape to the chromosphere and corona .",
    "however , our goal is not to construct a model that mimics the solar atmosphere , but to study a very simple sunspot models where we have control over the physics .    at the bottom layer",
    ", we impose that waves are evanescent .",
    "the initial individual magnetic flux tube is vertical in the @xmath13-direction .",
    "it is embedded in the polytropic background atmosphere with a radial top profile given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the tube radius , and @xmath25 = 4820 g @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field has the same radial profile along the depth @xmath13 .",
    "the center of the sunspot model is located at the point @xmath26 mm , @xmath27 .",
    "the simulation without the flux tube corresponds to @xmath28 .",
    "the scattered wave field is obtained by subtracting the simulation without the flux tube from the simulation with the flux tube .",
    "we consider that the vertical velocity @xmath29 at the upper surface is the most appropriate component to analyze the scattering since it is the only component that can be measured with dopplergrams from the solar disk center .",
    "all the slices of the scattered vertical velocity in this paper were taken near the surface at the depth @xmath30 km .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the unperturbed full wave field of the component @xmath29 taken at @xmath6 seconds .",
    "the amplitude of the incoming wave is normalized at 1 .",
    "this will set the scale for the scattered wave .    according to the variation of the sound and the alfvn speeds in the enhanced polytropic atmosphere , the plasma-@xmath31 is not constant inside the tube .",
    "these speeds are set to be equal at a depth of 400 km where the plasma-@xmath32 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider only the @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering without focusing on the phase shift variation , where @xmath0-@xmath33 mode - mixing decreases rapidly with increasing radial number @xmath34 @xcite .    in our simulations ,",
    "the monolithic models with a large radius can be considered as thick tubes with respect to the wavelength of the incoming wave .",
    "the coupling between the fast and the slow magnetoacoustic waves makes the distinction between different modes difficult , particularly near the surface where @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , these tubes will scatter in all @xmath36 and the vertical velocity will appear as a summation of all these modes .     at @xmath37 = 3300",

    "we are inspecting the multiple - scattering from two complementary points of view :    1- from a visual inspection of the scattered wave field ; we compare the scattered wave field of a monolithic model with that of cluster models .",
    "as the @xmath0-mode has a maximum of power at the surface , multiple - scattering from a cluster model is easily identifiable when individual tubes scatter waves to the near field making their specific signatures in that region . in the figure 9 of @xcite ,",
    "we have observed a multiple - scattering signature from two loose clusters made of 7 and 9 tubes respectively ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the near - field area extends till a distance of 2 mm from these structures in the @xmath10-direction and it can be clearly distinguished from the wave field of the equivalent monolithic tube .",
    "+ 2- from the temporal profiles of the scattered surface vertical velocity measured at a single point situated in the far field .",
    "actually , the multiple - scattering regime enhances the absorption of the incoming wave ( near - field scattering ) leading to a decrease in the amplitude of the scattering measured in the far field .",
    "the visual inspection of multiple - scattering effects from a pair of magnetic flux tubes and from two loose clusters made of 7 and 9 tubes was confirmed by using this method @xcite .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that the multiple - scattering regime occurs for a separation distance @xmath41 which is approximately @xmath42 in the case of 3 mhz @xmath0-mode . however , for a separation @xmath43 , we have got a coherent scattering regime which is characterized by the enhancement of the scattering in both near field and far field , but no absorption was measured in the far field . since both ranges correspond to the scattering regime , we can merge them to get @xmath44 . in conclusion , we can state that the scattering regime occurs when the separation distance between tubes within cluster is @xmath45 , where @xmath42 is the lower limit and @xmath46 is the upper limit . the latter value is consistent with previous studies by @xcite and @xcite who agree that the extent of the region of influence of the near field in multiple - scattering is @xmath9/2 .",
    "to probe the subsurface structure of sunspots , it is essential to construct adequate sunspot models that mimic the full complexity of solar magnetic structures .",
    "however , our aim is not to study a realistic sunspot to reproduce quantitatively the observations , but to get specific seismic signatures from simple sunspot models with basic properties in order to distinguish between them , at least qualitatively .",
    "in addition to monolithic and cluster models of the sunspot that were studied by @xcite and previous papers , we have incorporated here an intermediate new model to better interpret and understand the results .",
    "we have carried out three simulations shown in figure [ fig3 ] ( a , b , c ) where the scattered wave field at @xmath37 = 3300 s is displayed .",

    "we recall that we will restrict our analysis on the left scattered wave field to the magnetic elements where their oscillations are observed without a contribution from the incoming wave .",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) shows the scattering from the cluster .",
    "no signature of multiple - scattering regime was observed from this model .",
    "however , we observe that waves seem to be slightly compressed in the @xmath10-direction compared to the circular waveform of the monolithic tube of 880 km radius .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that a pair of flux tubes aligned perpendicular to the direction of the incoming wave oscillate simultaneously with the @xmath0-mode in @xmath12-direction whatever the separation @xmath7 is .",
    "indeed , we can distinguish within the cluster two pairs of tubes in a perpendicular configuration to the incoming wave .",
    "@xcite observed in their simulations that waves ( @xmath0-mode ) scattered by a spaghetti model of the sunspot are more flat compared to that scattered by a monolithic tube .",
    "it is reasonable to infer that the flattening observed in our simulation is the same phenomenon described by these authors .",
    "the oscillation of tubes in @xmath12-direction when wave propagates contributes to the scattered wave giving this appearance .",
    "this effect could be amplified if there are more tubes inside the bundle .    as is apparent from figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", the scattered wave fields of the hexagonal monolithic model ( c ) and its equivalent monolithic tube ( b ) seem to be similar , at least qualitatively .      to complete this study , we need to investigate how oscillations from sunspot models vary with the frequency .",
    "to do so , we have fixed the separation distance @xmath7 as in the cluster ( a ) , and we have changed the wavelength @xmath9 of the incoming wave through the change in frequency .",
    "this will allow us to change the ratio @xmath53 without changing the size of the cluster .",
    "we have studied the scattered wave field for the different models ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) using four frequencies of @xmath0-mode .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the scattered vertical velocity @xmath29 as a function of time measured at point b(-14,0 ) for the different magnetic features ( figure [ fig3 ] ) and for four frequencies of @xmath0-mode ( from 2 to 5 mhz ) .",
    "the amplitude of the incoming wave in an unperturbed field is normalized at 1 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "firstly , we observe that the curves are more extended in time for @xmath54 mhz than for @xmath55 mhz where the wave packets are more compressed .",
    "this effect shows the variation of the wavelength of the wave packet with the frequency .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , figure [ fig4 ] confirms that the monolithic tube ( b ) and the hexagonal monolithic model ( c ) have the same behaviour and consequently oscillate in phase , while the hexagonal monolithic model shows a reduced amplitude relative to that of the monolithic tube for all frequencies .",
    "the behaviour of the scattered curve from the compact cluster model is more interesting . for @xmath56 mhz ( @xmath57 )",
    ", the curve of the cluster measured in b shows a similar trend as the curve of the single tube of 200 km radius . at these frequencies ,",
    "the cluster should oscillate as a monolithic tube of the same size .",
    "however , it oscillates with a different mode due to its fibril structure , which demonstrates the particularity of this model with a behaviour completely different from that of the monolithic tube at this frequency .    for @xmath55 mhz ,",
    "the curve of the cluster starts to be out of phase with that of the single tube of 200 km radius .",
    "this case corresponds to the multiple - scattering regime in principle since the condition @xmath58 is satisfied .",
    "however , no signature of the tubeswaves from the cluster was observed in the near field at this frequency .",
    "in fact , individual tubes within the cluster start to oscillate more efficiently in @xmath12-direction , which explains probably the reduction of the scattering amplitude of the cluster at this frequency .",
    "in this section , we want to know if the multiple - scattering regime occurs for a larger size compact cluster , which corresponds to a larger separation distance ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the distance @xmath7 in the case of a cluster is fixed as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the radius of an individual tube within the cluster .",
    "nevertheless , multiple - scattering regime occurs if @xmath7 is about @xmath44 . in this case",
    "a radius of @xmath59 km satisfies the condition of multiple - scattering at the standard frequency @xmath38 mhz .",
    "given that , we have made the simulations displayed in figure [ fig5 ] where snapshots ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) show the propagation of an @xmath0-mode wave packet through : +    * \\(a ) a cluster of seven identical flux tubes in a hexagonal compact configuration .",

    "we observe from figure [ fig5 ] that unlike the case of small sunspot models , the scattered near fields of the large hexagonal monolithic and monolithic tube models are different .",
    "the close near field of the hexagonal monolithic model ( c ) shows a non - uniform waveform , which indicates a contribution from the outer extents ( or from the gaps between the extents ) to the scattering .    the cluster in snapshot ( a ) shows a triangular shape waveform in the left near field",

    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the scattered vertical velocity @xmath29 as a function of time measured at point b ( figure [ fig5 ] ) for the different magnetic features and for @xmath0-mode frequencies . as in the figure [ fig4 ] ,",
    "the incoming wave in an unperturbed field have an amplitude of 1 . unlike the small cluster model",
    ", we observe that the scattered curves of the large cluster are not in phase with that of the single tube of 400 km for all frequencies .",
    "similarly , the scattering curves of the hexagonal monolithic model and its equivalent monolithic tube are no longer in phase , which indicates a different behaviour for both models .",
    "it is also observed that the scattering from the hexagonal monolithic model increases with frequency .",
    "it reaches a maximum at @xmath61 mhz and @xmath55 mhz where it dominates the scattering from the other models .",
    "in previous sections , we measured the scattered surface vertical velocity from a single point in the far field ( point b ) .",
    "the obtained results can be checked with the observation of the solar surface with dopplergrams .",
    "however , we need more quantitative analysis to qualify the scattering , not only from a single point ( b ) but over all the @xmath12-ridge . in this section ,",
    "we use the vertical scattered wave , measured along the line @xmath62 , to compute the scattering cross section @xmath63 for the different sunspot models and frequencies .",
    "the scattering cross section is a very important parameter in the scattering problem .",
    "it is defined for an incident plane wave as the total scattered power over the power per unit area of the incident wave . in our case , for a given frequency , the one - dimensional scattering cross section @xmath63 can be expressed as    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are respectively the amplitudes of the scattered and the incoming vertical velocity at the surface measured at the point @xmath67 .",
    "the distance @xmath68 is the separation between the center of the sunspot model and the point b along the @xmath10 axis ( @xmath69 mm ) .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the scattering cross section computed for the small and the large sunspot models .",
    "@xmath63 is computed over @xmath70 ( from @xmath71 mm to @xmath72 mm ) and from @xmath73 to @xmath6 s.    while small monolithic tube and hexagonal monolithic models oscillate in the same ways ( figure [ fig4 ] ) , the left panel of figure [ fig7 ] shows that the scattering cross section for the small monolithic tube is larger than that of the small hexagonal model .    the scattering cross section of the small compact cluster model increases with the frequency over that of the two other models , except at the frequency of @xmath55 mhz where it decreases below that of the monolithic tube model .",
    "we attribute this particular behaviour to the absorption caused mainly by the simultaneous oscillations of tubes within the cluster in the @xmath12-direction .    unlike the small cluster model , the large compact cluster model in the right panel of figure [ fig7 ] shows a minimum of scattering cross section compared to the scattering from the other models .",
    "this result is explained by the multiple - scattering regime ( @xmath74 mhz ) and the absorption from tubes within the cluster .",
    "the large monolithic tube and hexagonal monolithic models have almost the same scattering cross section for the frequencies @xmath75 mhz , whereas at the frequency @xmath55 mhz , the scattering cross section of the large hexagonal monolithic model increases slightly above that of the monolithic tube model .",
    "this result can be seen clearly in figure [ fig6 ] at the frequency @xmath55 mhz where the scattering from this model is larger than the scattering from the other models .",
    "actually , the geometrical shape of the large hexagonal model imposes a constraint on the oscillation modes that are excited in it in comparison with the cylindrical shape of the monolithic tube . in this case , more oscillation modes are excited inside the monolithic tube than inside the hexagonal model . therefore , we have less absorption and more scattering of waves from the hexagonal model than from the monolithic tube model of the same size .",
    "this is a very important observation which reveals how the geometrical shape affects the input and output of waves in large sunspots particularly for a high frequency .",
    "in this paper , we are interested in finding a way to distinguish between distinct models that characterize the magnetic structure of sunspots .",
    "this can be observed through the scattered wave field when waves interact with these features .",
    "direct numerical simulations have begun to describe the scattering regime for an ensemble of magnetic flux tubes ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the latter paper , we have studied the interaction of an @xmath0-mode of 3 mhz frequency with monolithic and cluster models of the sunspot . in this present study , we have incorporated for the first time a non - circular , or a hexagonal monolithic tube as a third model that can be used as a junction between the previous two models to better interpret the scattered wave field . while the truly sunspot like the latter model or the compact hexagonal cluster could not realistically exist , it is always useful as a first step to understand a minimum of physics or observations using simple models which do not require important or expensive computational resources .    to discuss the scattering as a function of @xmath53 , instead of changing the distance between two neighboring tubes within the cluster @xmath7 as in @xcite , we have fixed @xmath7 as in hexagonal compact cluster separation , and we have changed the wavelength @xmath9 of the incoming wave through the variation of the frequency to see if we can have a multiple - scattering regime and absorption from a cluster in a close - packed configuration as in the case of a loose cluster in the same regime .    for more general results ,",
    "we have performed simulations with two kinds of a cluster :    1- small cluster as in @xcite which it is made of seven compact tubes of 200 km radius , where the separation distance @xmath76 km ,    2- large size cluster composed of seven compact tubes of 400 km radius , where @xmath77 mm .    for the frequencies @xmath78 mhz , we have demonstrated that the small cluster ( @xmath79 ) oscillates more like individual tube of 200 km than like monolithic tube of the same size , but with a larger amplitude . at this frequency range ,",
    "the scattering cross section of the small cluster is the largest compared to that of the other models , revealing that this model acts more like a scatterer object under these conditions .",
    "this important result can be verified with helioseismic measurements to distinguish between close - packed and loose configurations of magnetic flux tubes inside sunspots or plage in part , and between fibril and monolithic configurations of sunspots in other part .    for the high frequency of 5 mhz ,",
    "the small cluster which is supposed to be in a scattering regime ( @xmath80 ) oscillates in a different way compared to the other models .",
    "however , no signature of a multiple - scattering has been observed in the near field .",
    "nevertheless , a distortion of the scattered wave field in the @xmath12-direction has been observed for this model .",
    "a similar observation was mentioned by @xcite showing a more flattened scattered wave from a spaghetti model .",
    "we think that this particular signature is caused by the simultaneous oscillation in @xmath12-direction of the pairs of tubes aligned in a perpendicular direction to the incoming wave , independently from the scattering regime or the separation distance as shown by @xcite .",
    "this effect combined with the multiple - scattering condition at this frequency can explain the absorption by the cluster observed at this specific frequency in both scattering amplitude and cross section plots .",
    "this result constitutes an another criterion to distinguish a compact fibril sunspot from a monolithic one in this frequency range .",
    "we have to note that this effect should be amplified with the increasing of tubes number inside the cluster .",
    "in contrast to the small cluster , the large size cluster shows a multiple - scattering in the near field and a minimum of scattering cross section , which indicates more absorption by tubes within the cluster .",
    "however , this absorption seems to be not significant to be observed in the scattering cross section plot as in the case of small sunspot model .    to have some scattering regime , tubes within cluster have to exchange their scattering through the separation distance @xmath7 . in the case of a cluster of compact tubes , the distance @xmath7 is completely immersed in the magnetic field of the pair of tubes , where for a loose cluster , a part of the space between tubes is outside magnetic field .",
    "therefore , somehow the magnetic field within the cluster of compact tubes does not support the scattering exchange between tubes in the horizontal direction , but rather supports simultaneous motion of tubes acting as a glue that holds the tubes together .",
    "curiously , this characteristic describes the acoustic jacket phenomenon @xcite which is a near field of slow waves around the tube that propagate vertically in a stratified atmosphere carrying energy away , but they are evanescent in the radial direction . we know from previous studies that the gravitational stratification removes resonant absorption of a bundle of magnetic flux tubes and may reduce strong interactions between closely spaced flux tubes .",
    "@xcite found that the mutual induction of the near - field jackets of two tubes on close separations can dramatically alter the scattering properties of the system playing an important role in the multiple - scattering regime .",
    "given that , it is possible that the interaction between jacket modes of tubes within the cluster of compact tubes ( @xmath81 ) inhibits the multiple - scattering regime .    in conclusion , in addition to the minimum condition @xmath42 for the small cluster to have a multiple - scattering regime",
    ", the distance @xmath7 between tubes within this model has to be larger than the distance between the locations of the minimum of the magnetic field strength in the pair of tubes .",
    "the case of the large cluster model is different .",
    "it is possible that the scattering from larger size individual tubes within this cluster is not completely absorbed through the jacket mode phenomenon , which explains probably the observation of near - field waves from this model despite @xmath81 .    in this context",
    ", we have to note that since this lower limit of multiple - scattering regime depends on the size of the tubes , this distance would be much smaller in the case of the thin flux tube approximation .",
    "independently from the cluster model , our simulations show that the small size hexagonal monolithic model oscillates like its equivalent monolithic tube model for all frequencies , with more scattering for the latter model .    a more interesting behaviour is observed for the large size hexagonal monolithic model . this model and its equivalent monolithic tube",
    "have approximately the same scattering cross section for low and mean frequencies .",
    "however , the large hexagonal model shows less absorption in a high frequency .",
    "in fact , due to its geometrical shape , less oscillation modes are excited inside compared to the supported waves in the monolithic tube model .",
    "this is an important result , demonstrating a reasonable effect of the sunspot geometrical shape on the interaction of high - frequency waves with large monolithic models , which must be taken into consideration in addition to the radius and the wavelength in future simulations .",
    "this work is a step toward the understanding of the helioseismic signature of sunspot models .",
    "more improved numerical and analytical investigations are necessary to better interpret the observations .",
    "the author thanks robert cameron and toufik abdelatif for useful discussions . the author also thanks the anonymous referee for constructive comments and suggestions that improve the quality of the paper ."
