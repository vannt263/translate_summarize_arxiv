    "propagation of electromagnetic waves through stationary inhomogeneous media is a subject that has been extensively studied in the past @xcite .",
    "the physics of moving dielectric media @xcite is attracting renewed attention , mainly due to recent works by visser @xcite and leonhardt and piwnicki @xcite . particularly important is the formal equivalence between the equations of general relativity and the equations of light propagation in arbitrarily moving dielectric media , which has been fully recognized in the early literature @xcite .",
    "much less attention , however , has been devoted to the case of light propagation through an inhomogeneous medium which possesses a time - dependent refractive index , and in particular light scattering by nonstationary interfaces between two media with different refractive indices .",
    "this must be distinguished from the above case of a moving medium , in that the nonstationary interfaces may possess arbitrary velocity @xmath0 , in the range @xmath1 .",
    "this well - known fact @xcite is not in conflict with special relativity because the medium itself is immobile , and only the interfaces of the transition regions of the refractive index change in time .",
    "this apparent motion of the interfaces is due to the time - varying nature of the refractive index , since it is not connected to the real motion of any physical particle or wave , and is not restricted by any limiting velocity , so that the function @xmath2 that describes the spatiotemporal variations of the refractive index is completely arbitrary . in particular lorentz transformations , which of course play a crucial role in the physics of moving media , are not applicable to the physics of media with a time - varying refractive index .",
    "for example , the field amplitudes of the waves generated inside the latter media are not found via lorentz boosts , and the constitutive relations between the dielectric displacement and the electric field are fixed and not subject to lorentz transformations , in contrast with the physics of moving media , described , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first attempt to develop a theory for the very special case of plane wave propagation in a homogeneous medium with a sudden step - like temporal variation of refractive index has been given by morgenthaler in 1958 @xcite , but only after more than a decade this work has been noticed and other aspects of propagation in the same system have been explored by felsen and whitman in 1970 @xcite and by fante in 1971 @xcite .",
    "a more recent review of the salient features of the optics of nonstationary media , with particular emphasis on plasma physics applications , has been given by shvartsburg in 2005 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the effect of an _ arbitrary _ space- and time - dependence of refractive index @xmath2 on the propagation of electromagnetic waves and pulses in media without dispersion .",
    "we shall provide a unified theoretical approach , with which we are able to study the scattering of light by nonstationary interfaces moving at arbitrary velocities .",
    "light propagation through media with a small number of nonstationary interfaces has been investigated by a variety of experimental techniques @xcite , as discussed further in the final discussion and conclusions section .",
    "our results here include these cases but also address the behavior that could be achieved by further extension to an arbitrary number of well - controlled nonstationary interfaces .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate the potential of nonstationary dielectrics for light control and manipulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ sec : analyticalresults ] we construct the basic theoretical tools that are necessary for the analysis and the understanding of the building blocks of spatiotemporal dielectric structures .",
    "first of all , in subsection [ sec : main - equation ] our master equation [ eq.([main ] ) ] is derived from maxwell s equations , and its geometrical interpretation in terms of forward- and backward - moving fields is given .",
    "after that , in subsection [ matrices ] the interface transfer matrix for the general case is calculated explicitly , while in subsection [ sec : calc - prop - matr ] the expression for free propagation when the fields are far from interfaces is derived , and a criterion for defining sharp interfaces is found . in subsection",
    "[ sec : plane - wave - expansion ] we use special orthogonal variables to introduce plane wave expansion of arbitrary fields , which allows us to find the transfer propagation matrix in fourier space .    in section [ applications ]",
    "we describe three fundamental applications of the concept expressed in section [ sec : analyticalresults ] . in subsection [ nonstationaryinterface ]",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients of several important configurations of nonstationary interfaces are derived , and numerical simulations of pulse scattering from interfaces are provided in order to confirm the theoretical expressions . in subsection",
    "[ sec : photoniccrystals ] we discuss nonstationary multilayer structures , and provide the analogue of quarter wavelength condition for a generalized nonstationary bragg reflector , and the transformation of the bandstructure and the bandgaps under rotations of the @xmath3-plane are examined . in subsection [ spacetimelenses ]",
    "we deal with a special device , the spatiotemporal analogue of a lens .",
    "we show , including numerical simulations , how such a lens can be used to perform pulse compression or broadening , with the consequent manipulation of pulse frequency and wavenumber .",
    "the results presented in sections [ sec : analyticalresults ] and [ applications ] are obtained by solving the full maxwell equations .",
    "we derive in section [ slow ] an exact equation to describe the evolution of the pulse envelope .",
    "we consider how this equation is modified if we introduce a slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) in time .",
    "numerical simulations are then presented to show that the svea introduces errors in the detail of pulse propagation for the problems we are considering , due to the neglect of effects associated with sharp spatiotemporal interfaces .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us start by assuming that we have an electromagnetic wave , with its electric and magnetic fields @xmath4^{t}$ ] and @xmath5^{t}$ ] linearly polarized along the directions @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the @xmath8-component of the electric field and the @xmath9-component of the magnetic field depend on the variable @xmath10 only , because in conditions of normal incidence we assume that any change of the time - dependent refractive index occurs along the propagation direction @xmath11 .",
    "the linear polarization @xmath12 of the medium will be written in the form @xmath13{\\mathbf{e}}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the linear susceptibility of the non - magnetic medium and @xmath2 is the linear space - time dependent refractive index , which is assumed for simplicity to be independent of the frequency @xmath15 and to be real .",
    "this model for the susceptibility is obviously simplified , but for the purposes of the present paper the frequency dispersion of the refractive index is not essential and will be disregarded for sake of clarity . here and in the following",
    "we choose to use the very convenient heaviside - lorentz units system @xcite , in which @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath12 are measured in the same physical units ( v / m ) , and there are no extra multiplying factors @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in maxwell s equations .",
    "maxwell s equations for the scalar quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be written in the following form ( @xmath23 is the speed of light in vacuum ) : @xmath24 where the two divergence maxwell s equations are automatically satisfied due to the chosen polarization and the normal incidence assumption .",
    "it is possible to cast eqs.([maxwell ] ) in a different form , which turns out to be much more convenient for the analysis of time - varying photonic crystals and lenses , using the fact that the problem under consideration is ( 1 + 1)-dimensional . defining _",
    "right- and left - moving fields , @xmath25 , we can write eqs.([maxwell ] ) in the following compact form : @xmath26\\psi=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath27^{t}$ ] ( with the superscript @xmath28 we indicate vector transposition ) , and @xmath29 are the identity matrix and the first and third ( real ) pauli matrices .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 are the pauli projectors ( @xmath31 ) , and @xmath32 is the derivative operator @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 can be thought of as basis vectors for a tangent space @xmath36 of the two - dimensional manifold @xmath37 formed by the @xmath3-plane equipped with a space - time dependent refractive index function @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal evolution of the dielectric structure is only contained in the logarithmic term @xmath38 , which couples the forward- and the backward - propagating components of the electromagnetic field .",
    "all conclusions of this paper are based on an analysis of the main eq.([main ] ) .",
    "one can appreciate the remarkably high level of symmetry between space and time contained in eq.([main ] ) with the following arguments .",
    "the propagation of the local field @xmath39 occurs only along the ( local ) direction specified by @xmath40 , while the field @xmath41 evolves only along @xmath42 .",
    "therefore @xmath40 and @xmath42 determine , at each point of the @xmath3-plane , the local light cone along which the forward and backward components of the electric field propagate .",
    "the geometrical meaning of our construction based on eq.([main ] ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] , where examples of the local light cones defined by the directions determined by @xmath43 and the propagating forward / backward fields @xmath44 are shown ( see also caption for further explanation of the geometrical meaning of our construction ) .",
    "contrary to a widespread approach @xcite , we do not make use of any complex slowly varying variable , such as a field envelope , and therefore eq.([main ] ) remains valid for all regimes of propagation , and all quantities appearing in eq.([main ] ) are real . a slow variable version of eq.([main ] ) will be examined in section [ slow ] , and a comparison between the exact approach of eq.([main ] ) and the approximate one of eq.([scalorasveat ] ) will be presented .",
    "note that the coupling between @xmath39 and @xmath41 is only induced via the logarithmic term @xmath38 in eq.([main ] ) , so that only space - time variations of the refractive index are responsible for coupling forward and backward waves during propagation .",
    "we can therefore identify two basic cases in which the analytical solution of eq.([main ] ) is straightforward , namely the case where @xmath45 changes abruptly from @xmath46 to @xmath47 along a line in the @xmath3-plane , and the case of a homogeneous and static medium , where eq.([main ] ) simply becomes @xmath48 . in the following two subsections",
    "these two cases are examined individually .",
    "the geometry of propagation of fields @xmath49 along the directions determined by @xmath50 is shown , where @xmath51 refers to the refractive index @xmath52 .",
    "the grey area represents the spatiotemporal region of refractive index change in the plane @xmath3 . for this simple example , the external and the internal regions have uniform indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "bold dashed arrows indicate the propagating fields , generated by the scattering of @xmath55 from an interaction point on the interface .",
    "local light cones are also indicated . assuming that @xmath56 , wider light cones are associated with index @xmath53 , whereas narrower light cones are associated with index @xmath54 .",
    "only space - time variations of refractive index are able to generate coupling between forward and backward waves in eq.([main ] ) , so that in the case shown in the figure only the interface is able to scatter an incident electromagnetic wave . ]",
    "we assume that the refractive index changes in a step - like fashion along a nonstationary interface in the @xmath3-plane , postponing the discussion of the validity of this sharpness assumption to the end of the next paragraph .",
    "the generic form of the refractive index is then given by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 are the refractive indices of the first and the second media , and @xmath59 is the heaviside function .",
    "@xmath60 denotes the angle between the @xmath61-axis and the interface in the @xmath3-plane , which we will occasionally also parameterize via the slope parameter @xmath62 .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath63 represents the velocity of the nonstationary interface .",
    "this velocity is arbitrary , and in particular it can be greater than the local speed of light .",
    "this is not in conflict with special relativity , because the nonstationary interface is not associated with a moving medium , and it constitutes one of the main differences between the present work and previous literature on nonstationary dielectrics . for different aspects of the physics of moving media",
    "the reader is referred to chapter ix of landau @xcite , section i.5 of jackson @xcite , and to more recent works by yeh and collaborators @xcite , saca @xcite , huang @xcite and by leonhardt and piwnicki @xcite .",
    "our task is now to find an appropriate transfer matrix connecting the amplitudes of the fields @xmath44 on either side of the interface .",
    "we call this an _",

    "this implies that our derivation is not valid in the regime where @xmath96 .",
    "the physical reason for this will be discussed at the end of the next subsection , after we introduce the free propagation matrix .      from the knowledge of the general transfer matrix for a nonstationary interface [ eq.([transfer ] ) ] , it is possible to construct the transfer matrix for more complicated nonstationary objects , such as multilayer structures , which will be done in section [ applications ] .",
    "however , we still need to construct one missing ingredient , the so - called _ propagation matrix _ , which models the propagation of the fields along the @xmath65-direction far from the interfaces , where the refractive index is constant . under this condition , eq.([main ] ) simply becomes @xmath48 , which using the definitions of eq .",

    "the concept of the interface matrix [ eq.([transfer ] ) ] expressed in section [ matrices ] is only valid for a sufficiently sharp interface , i.e. if the interface transition layer is sufficiently thin , such that the effect of the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) can be neglected while traversing the interface . for a given interface width @xmath102 we can calculate via ( [ finitediff2 ] ) the length of the interval @xmath107 along the interface which is relevant for the propagator . if @xmath44 does not change significantly on this interval , i.e. if @xmath112 then the propagator is negligible and the use of the interface matrix of eq.([transfer ] ) is justified .",
    "note however that the left hand side of eq.[eq:5 ] becomes singular for @xmath113 , and then [ eq:5 ] will not be fulfilled for any choice of @xmath102 . in particular , for @xmath56 , if @xmath114 , then during the integration of [ eq:3 ] we will reach the point where the singularity in [ eq:5 ] occurs .",
    "this is precisely at the point where the matrix @xmath115 also becomes singular .",
    "the condition on the sharpness of the interface which was used in the derivation of eq.([transfer ] ) can therefore in principle not be fulfilled and therefore we shall not use eq.([transfer ] ) in the regime of @xmath116 .",

    "@xmath119 has the dimension of a wavenumber , and physically it represents the momentum associated to the propagation along the @xmath66-direction .    inside a homogeneous medium",
    "we can expand @xmath103 in plane waves along both the @xmath65 and @xmath66 axes : @xmath120 since each plane wave component has to fulfill the propagator equation @xmath121 , we obtain for the two components @xmath44 the following dispersion relations : @xmath122 which can also be directly deduced from eq.([finitediff2 ] ) .",
    "this enables us to rewrite the free propagator ( [ propagator ] ) for the fourier components as @xmath123 an expression that will be useful in section [ sec : photoniccrystals ] .    as a final issue",

    "first of all for @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) it follows that @xmath130 and @xmath131 , so that in the static case the @xmath65-direction coincides with the @xmath10-axis and the @xmath66-direction coincides with the @xmath61-axis by definition .",
    "but because the @xmath66-direction is associated with the delocalization direction of an arbitrary plane wave in eq.([eq:11 ] ) , it follows that during the scattering process of light by a static interface the quantity @xmath131 is conserved .",
    "this corresponds to the energy conservation at the interaction point .",
    "in other words , all generated waves will have exactly the same frequency .",
    "the other limiting case is when @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) . for this case",
    "the role of frequency and wavenumber is reversed , and from eq.([rotation ] ) we have @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the delocalization direction is still along @xmath66 , which now points along the @xmath10-axis .",
    "therefore during the scattering it is the wavenumber ( i.e. the momentum ) that is conserved at the interaction point , and in general all generated waves will have different frequencies but the same momentum . for an intermediate situation ( @xmath136 ) , the conserved quantity @xmath119 corresponds to a combination of @xmath137 and @xmath138 according to the rotation of eq.([rotation ] ) .",

    "many theoretical and experimental results exist in the literature , that discuss the interaction of electromagnetic pulses with a plasma front @xcite .",
    "this interaction has been typically used in practice to shift the central frequency of an incident pulse by means of the effect discussed in section [ spacetimelenses ] , see refs .",
    "@xcite , or to convert static electric fields into electromagnetic pulses by means of a capacitor array @xcite .",
    "these effects may turn out to be extremely useful in the creation of efficient tunable laser sources @xcite .",
    "for instance , in typical experiments @xcite , when a probe pulse is propagating along the longitudinal coordinate of a semiconductor waveguide , one can change the refractive index of the material along all its spatial extension by means of irradiating the plane of the crystal with another source pulse that creates a electron - hole plasma throughout the crystal .",
    "if the source pulse has a certain angle of incidence @xmath295 with respect to the normal to the plane of the waveguide , then the ionization front of the plasma will move with velocity @xmath296 @xcite .",
    "note that for normal incidence ( @xmath297 ) , this front moves instantaneously , and it corresponds to the time - like interface ( @xmath132 , where the general relation between @xmath60 and @xmath295 is @xmath298 ) discussed in section [ nonstationaryinterface ] , which follows from a simultaneous change of refractive index throughout all the spatial extension of the crystal .",
    "this front does not carry any information , and it is not associated to any moving object , therefore its propagation is not limited by the speed of light in vacuum . in all these cases , none of the actual particles in the excited medium is moving faster than @xmath23 ; instead , the front profile only has an apparent motion , which can be characterized by an effective velocity given by the above formula , but does not correspond by any means to any real superluminal motion of particles or information , which is of course forbidden by special relativity . in this sense , @xmath2 can be a totally arbitrary function with no relation whatsoever to moving bodies . in another kind of experiments @xcite ,",
    "short pulses of the order of nanoseconds are created by irradiating a metal surface by x - rays at a certain angle of incidence @xmath295 , which creates a photoelectric current .",
    "again , this current undergoes an apparent motion at a velocity @xmath296 and , by means of superluminal self - phasing of the excited elementary dipoles ( predicted by carron and longmire in 1976 @xcite ) , emits a short electromagnetic pulse at the same angle @xmath295 .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the processes described briefly above can also have considerable implications for the physics of astrophysical plasmas @xcite .    a remark which is important for the present work is that it is assumed that the physical experiments well approximate a condition of quasi - one - dimensional propagation of the incident probe pulse , therefore implying a well - localized confinement of the transverse profile by means of a strong waveguiding process which does not allow diffraction , so that the equations we have derived in this paper , having the transverse ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and the longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) degrees of freedom decoupled , can be safely utilized .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper the physics of light propagation scattered by nonstationary interfaces has been investigated analytically and numerically in a unified approach .",
    "interface transfer matrix and propagation matrix have been found for the general case of arbitrary velocities of the interface .",
    "these ingredients have been used to construct more complicated spatiotemporal dielectric structures . in particular , we have first investigated a spatiotemporal bragg reflector , where we have given the generalized condition for the existence of forbidden bandgaps , and found that the frequency bandgaps close for a critical value of @xmath139 , with the successive opening of the wavenumber bandgap at a second critical angle @xmath140 .",
    "secondly we have explored light scattering by a spatiotemporal lens device , and the spectral manipulation of pulses has been demonstrated both analytically and numerically , the most important aspect of which is a potentially strong pulse compression / broadening .",
