    "the masses of hadrons are created dynamically by the strong interaction , when confinement forces quarks and gluons to form color - neutral bound states .",
    "the generation of hadronic masses is connected to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , a basic feature of the vacuum structure of quantum - chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "evidently , the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking is of fundamental importance for the properties of matter in the universe .",
    "however , the quantitative understanding of the dynamics in this non - perturbative regime of qcd is still rather incomplete , and additional information from experiment is essential .    according to investigations of the non - perturbative properties of qcd on a discrete space - time lattice a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons ( qgp )",
    "should be formed at energy densities @xmath4  gev/@xmath5 . simultaneously with this deconfinement transition , chiral symmetry is expected to be restored ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . in collisions of heavy nuclei at high energies such energy densities",
    "are exceeded significantly and there is by now strong , albeit indirect evidence for the formation of a qgp ( for recent reviews see  @xcite ) . on the way to chiral symmetry restoration in such matter , significant modifications of the properties of hadrons are expected  @xcite , such as of their mass and width or more generally of the hadronic spectral function .",
    "the @xmath3  meson ( @xmath6 ) is an ideal probe to investigate modifications of such in - medium properties . in a hot hadronic medium close to the phase boundary ,",
    "@xmath3  mesons are abundantly produced by annihilation of thermal pions .",
    "due to its short lifetime ( @xmath7 fm ) , the decay of the @xmath8meson occurs inside the medium , and spectral modifications may be observable via the kinematic reconstruction of the decay products .",
    "finally , its decay into lepton pairs provides essentially undisturbed information from the hot and dense phase , because leptons are not subject to final state rescattering in the strongly interacting medium .",
    "enhanced low - mass @xmath0 pair production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at full energy of the cern - super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) has been reported by the ceres experiment .",
    "in particular , in the mass region 0.2 - 0.6  gev/@xmath9 , the measured di - lepton yield exceeds expectations from hadron decays by a factor 2 - 3  @xcite .",
    "even bigger enhancement factors have been found at 40@xmath1  gev/@xmath2  @xcite , albeit with large statistical uncertainties . at rhic energies , enhancement factors similar to those observed at the top sps energy",
    "have been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "significant @xmath3  meson production via annihilation of thermal pions in the hot and dense hadronic medium is a likely mechanism for enhanced electron pair production . implementing this mechanism , substantial temperature and baryon density dependent modifications of the @xmath3-spectral function  @xcite needed to be considered to explain the mass spectrum of the pair enhancement .",
    "however , the detailed behaviour of the spectral function as chiral symmetry is restored is still up to speculation .",
    "quite different theoretical approaches exist which could not be discriminated by the previous di - electron data .",
    "the na60 collaboration recently corroborated previous ceres findings and reported a significant di - muon excess in nucleus - nucleus collisions over the expectation from hadronic decays  @xcite .",
    "the na60 measurement of the di - muon excess in @xmath10in - in collisions at 158@xmath1  gev/@xmath2 favors models including significant broadening but no mass shift of the @xmath3-spectral function  @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we present results on @xmath0 pair production in central @xmath11pb-@xmath12au collisions at 158@xmath1  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the data have been recorded by the ceres experiment at the sps in the year 2000  @xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath13 lead ions per 5.2  s extraction cycle were focused on 13 thin gold targets aligned along the beam line ( 25  @xmath14 m each , totalling 1.2% of a nuclear interaction length ) .",
    "the interaction vertex was reconstructed using charged particle track segments from two silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) placed 10.4 and 14.3 cm downstream of the target .",
    "electrons are identified by their ring signature in two rich detectors , which are blind to hadrons below @xmath15 gev/@xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the experimental setup was upgraded by a downstream radial drift time projection chamber ( tpc ) which is operated inside an inhomogeneous magnetic field with a radial component of up to 0.75  t. employing tracking information from the tpc , the mass resolution of the spectrometer was improved to @xmath17 in the region of the @xmath18  meson mass  @xcite .",
    "the resolution has been determined by a monte carlo procedure where simulated tracks were embedded into real data events .",
    "this method provides a detailed simulation of the tpc response to charged particles in a realistic track density environment .",
    "the same monte carlo describes very well the experimentally observed peak width of the @xmath19 reconstructed in the @xmath20 channel ( @xmath21  mev/@xmath9 ) .",
    "the tpc also provides additional electron identification via measurement of the specific energy loss @xmath22 with a resolution of about 10% .",
    "the spectrometer provides full azimuthal acceptance in the pseudorapidity range @xmath23 .",
    "the present results are based on an analysis  @xcite of 25 million pb - au    events , selected at a centrality of @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "sdd track segments are matched to charged particle tracks in the tpc , where the deflection in the magnetic field determines the momentum with a resolution of @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "combined electron information from cuts on the ring quality in the rich detectors and tpc d@xmath26/d@xmath27 leads to a pion suppression of typically @xmath28 at 67% electron efficiency  @xcite .",
    "a set of cuts is applied to the track candidates to minimize the amount of combinatorial background from unrecognized dalitz pairs and conversions , making use of their characteristic decay topology .",
    "electron and positron tracks are rejected if their d@xmath26/d@xmath27 significantly exceeds that of a single track in both sdds , indicating an unresolved close pair .",
    "also , electron and positron tracks are rejected if a soft track with opposite charge and electron - like d@xmath26/d@xmath27 is found in the tpc at small angular separation .",
    "the remaining electron and positron tracks are then combined into pairs . to further suppress combinatorial background , tracks which form pairs with opening angle smaller than 35 mrad",
    "are treated as recognized conversions or dalitz pairs and are not used for further pairing .",
    "finally , a low transverse momentum cut of 0.2 gev/@xmath2 is applied to all electron and positron tracks .",
    "the single - electron reconstruction efficiency has been determined by a monte - carlo ( mc ) procedure where simulated tracks are embedded into real raw data events .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the mc sample includes all cuts and methods as applied to the real data .",
    "the final pair reconstruction efficiency @xmath29 is typically 14% .",
    "it depends on the polar angles of the single tracks and ( slightly ) on centrality .",
    "the efficiency correction is performed by assigning a weight @xmath30 to each pair which is the inverse of the pair reconstruction efficiency @xmath29 .",
    "the pair reconstruction efficiency is calculated from the single track efficiencies , using the parametrized dependencies on track polar angle @xmath31 and charged particle multiplicity @xmath32 : @xmath33    based on a systematic variation of the cut values in the mc , the systematic uncertainty on the pair reconstruction efficiency is estimated to 8.4% .",
    "the remaining combinatorial background is estimated to equal the number of like - sign lepton pairs from the same event .",
    "the limited statistics of the like - sign pair sample adds a significant statistical error to the final result .",
    "alternatively , a mixed - event technique can be applied , where unlike - sign pairs are formed from electron and positron tracks of different events and the corresponding mixed - event spectrum is normalized to the same - event like - sign yield .",
    "this approach reduces considerably the statistical bin - to - bin fluctuations but bears a statistical and systematic uncertainty due to the normalization procedure .",
    "the normalization constant is determined by the ratio of the mixed - event spectrum to the same - event like - sign spectrum .",
    "the statistical accuracy of the normalization is limited by the number of counts in the same - event like - sign spectrum and yields about @xmath34 . the uncertainty in the normalization of the background has been included in the systematic error of the final dilepton yield .",
    "the magnitude of this contribution after background subtraction depends on the signal - to - background ratio and yields typically 8.8% at @xmath35 =  1/22 ( see below ) .",
    "we found that the final results using the like - sign and the mixed - event sample are in good agreement within statistical errors  @xcite .",
    "small deviations are only visible at invariant masses below 0.1 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "this is caused by limitations of the two - ring separation , which are only present in the same - event sample . to account for this effect , which is also present in the true unlike - sign combinatorial background ,",
    "we have used the same - event like - sign background estimate for masses below 0.2  gev/@xmath9 .",
    "no statistical limitation is imposed by this procedure , since the signal - to - background ratio is very good in this mass region . for masses greater than 0.2  gev/@xmath9",
    ", the normalized mixed - event unlike - sign sample is used for background subtraction . the resulting background distribution and the unlike - sign signal pair spectrum after efficiency correction are shown in fig .",

    "the number of pairs contributing to the signal is @xmath39 at @xmath35  =  1/22 .",
    "after background subtraction , the @xmath0 pair yield is normalized to the total number of events and to the average charged particle multiplicity @xmath40 in the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "the average charged particle multiplicity has been determined by the number of tracks in the sdd .",
    "for the 7% most central events we obtain @xmath41 ( syst . ) in @xmath23 .",
    "the systematic error on @xmath40 adds a contribution of 8% to the total systematic error on the pair yield per charged particle .",
    "the total systematic error of the data is given by ( i ) the uncertainty of the efficiency determination ( 8.4% ) , ( ii ) the normalization of the mixed - event background ( @xmath42 , on average 8.8% ) and ( iii ) the determination of the charged particle multiplicity ( 8% ) .",
    "these contributions add up to an average of 14.6% , however , note that contribution ( ii ) differs bin - by - bin , depending on the local signal - to - background ratio , and applies only for @xmath43  gev/@xmath9 .",

    "that @xmath3-related pair production is indeed a manifestation of the hot and dense matter created is supported by observing a particular mechanism at work which plays a dominant role in the hadronic spectral function approach : the strong coupling to baryons which adds strength to the di - electron yield at low masses  @xcite .",
    "the importance of this mechanism is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( b ) , where the data are compared to in - medium hadronic spectral function calculations with and without baryon - induced interactions  @xcite .",
    "the calculations differ most in the mass range below 0.5  gev/@xmath9 , which is accessible with good efficiency by the present @xmath0 data .",
    "the calculation omitting baryon effects falls short of the data for masses below 0.5  gev/@xmath9 while inclusion of baryon interactions describes the measured low - mass yield very well .",
    "this is strong evidence that the observed modifications of the @xmath3-spectral function are foremost due to interactions with the dense baryonic medium .",
    "it has been demonstrated that baryon - driven medium modifications lead to a low - mass di - electron spectrum which is very similar to the di - electron rate from lowest order perturbative @xmath63 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "inspired by this apparent emergence of quark - hadron duality at low masses , gallmeister et al .",
    "performed a calculation assuming that di - electron production via @xmath63 annihilation at @xmath64 is dominant  @xcite . that this phenomenological approach describes the shape of the measured distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) so well may be taken as an indication of chiral symmetry restoration which is implied in quark - hadron duality .    in cold nuclear matter , medium modifications not only of @xmath3 but also of @xmath50 and @xmath18 mesons",
    "have been observed  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "such modifications may also be present in the medium created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it should be noted however that the dominance of thermal two - pion annihilation to the total di - lepton yield via the @xmath3-channel disfavors a significant contribution from @xmath50 and @xmath18 to the observed di - lepton excess and its spectral distribution .    in conclusion , the present @xmath0 data with improved mass resolution in the resonance region favor present models including a strong broadening of the @xmath3-spectral function in a hot and dense hadronic medium over a density dependent @xmath3 mass shift .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 data at low pair mass and transverse momentum allow to test the relevance of baryonic effects to the modification of the @xmath3-spectral function . in comparison with models ,",
    "the present ceres data suggest that baryonic interactions are important to explain the observed di - lepton yield at low masses .",
