    "cosmic neutrinos provide a unique window on astrophysical processes because they escape from dense regions and typically propagate to the earth unhindered  @xcite . at ultra - high energies",
    ", they also provide an important probe of new ideas in particle physics .",
    "in contrast to all other standard model ( sm ) particles , their known interactions are so weak that new physics may easily alter neutrino properties , sometimes drastically .",
    "this is especially relevant for neutrinos with energies above @xmath3 , which interact with nucleons with center - of - mass energies above 1 tev , where the sm is expected to be modified by new physics .",
    "the signal for ultra - high energy neutrinos is quasi - horizontal giant air showers initiated deep in the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "this signal is well - studied and easily differentiated from air showers initiated by hadrons . the earth s atmospheric depth rises from about @xmath4 vertically to nearly @xmath5 horizontally . for all but the most extreme ( and typically problematic  @xcite ) neutrino cross sections ,",
    "the mean free path of neutrinos is larger than even the horizontal atmospheric depth .",
    "neutrinos therefore interact with roughly equal probability at any point in the atmosphere and may initiate showers in the volume of air immediately above the detector .",
    "these will appear as `` normal '' showers , with large electromagnetic components , curved fronts ( a curvature radius of a few km ) , and signals well spread over time ( of the order of microseconds ) .",
    "on the other hand , hadrons have interaction lengths of the order of @xmath6 and so always interact at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the electromagnetic component of an air shower has mean interaction length @xmath7 .",
    "for a quasi - horizontal shower initiated by an ordinary hadron , then , this component is absorbed long before reaching the ground , as it has passed through the equivalent of several vertical atmospheres  2 at a zenith angle of @xmath8 , 3 at @xmath9 , and 6 at @xmath10 . in these showers , only high energy muons created in the first few generations of particles",
    "survive past 2 equivalent vertical atmospheres .",
    "the shape of the resulting shower front is therefore very flat ( with curvature radius above @xmath11 ) , and its time extension is very short ( less than @xmath12 ) .",
    "these shower characteristics are exploited by both ground arrays and fluorescence detectors in searches for primary cosmic ray neutrinos . at present , no ultra - high energy neutrino signal has been reported . here",
    "we determine the total exposure for neutrino detection from existing facilities and derive both model - independent and model - dependent bounds on astrophysical neutrino fluxes and new neutrino interactions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exposure ] we examine acceptances for neutrino detection and compute the current combined total exposure using all available data from the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa )  @xcite and fly s eye  @xcite experiments . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxes ] we determine model - independent bounds on the total neutrino flux , assuming sm cross sections . to derive model - independent results , we assume only that fluxes are confined to a small window around some central neutrino energy and obtain bounds as a function of this central energy . after that , we assume a power law neutrino flux @xmath13 to obtain stronger , but more model - dependent , bounds on the total neutrino flux from integrating over all energies .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : interactions ] we derive model - independent bounds on high energy neutrino cross sections , assuming a conservative cosmogenic flux .",
    "these significantly improve existing limits  @xcite .",
    "we then derive model - dependent bounds on cross sections , focusing on the example of tev - scale gravity scenarios in sec .",
    "[ sec : gravity ] .",
    "we improve existing constraints  @xcite on the fundamental planck scale from the non - observation of microscopic black hole production by cosmic neutrinos  @xcite . for large numbers of extra dimensions ,",
    "these bounds are comparable to or exceed all existing bounds on extra dimensions . sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "to estimate the sensitivity of a ground - based detector to neutrino - initiated showers , we must first compute its exposure for various types of showers .",
    "the exposure is the product of the effective aperture and the range of depths within which the shower must originate to trigger the device , integrated over time .",
    "the effective aperture is the detector s projected area weighted by detection probability and integrated over solid angle .",
    "the exposure is , then , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total observation time of the detector , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the density of the atmosphere at ground level .",
    "the effective aperture is  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the detector s area , @xmath21 is the probability that a shower that arrives with energy @xmath22 and zenith angle @xmath23 triggers the detector , and the angular cuts @xmath24 and @xmath25 are chosen to optimize detection efficiency while eliminating hadronic background .",
    "exposures at a given detector depend on detection method and shower type .",
    "we will refer to showers as hadronic or electromagnetic ( em ) , depending on the nature of their first interaction , irrespective of their later development . with this convention ,",
    "for example , the sm neutral current process @xmath26 produces a hadronic shower , while the charged current process for _ electron _ neutrinos @xmath27 produces both a hadronic shower and an em shower .    for ground arrays , exposures for hadronic and em",
    "showers differ  @xcite . in hadronic showers ,",
    "the initial hadronic interaction produces a strong muon component that remains until the shower reaches the ground .",
    "this muon component is largely absent for em showers .",
    "these muons significantly enhance triggering efficiencies for ground arrays , which are sensitive only to ground level activity , and so exposures for hadronic showers exceed exposures for em showers at ground arrays . above some critical energy , which depends on the total effective area of the array , the detector exposure saturates .",
    "exposures for hadronic and em showers for the agasa ground array  @xcite are given in fig .",
    "[ exposure ] .",
    "these exposures are for @xmath28 of livetime between december 1995 and november 2000 .",
    "the hadronic exposure was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on results from searches for deeply penetrating showers  @xcite and conservative assumptions .",
    "we derive the em exposure by comparison with results for the auger experiment .",
    "effective apertures for auger have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite . for agasa",
    ", we adopt the auger aperture for quasi - horizontal em showers with axes falling in the array , reduced by a factor of 30 , the ratio of surface areas of the arrays .",
    "we have checked that , using this em exposure , we reproduce agasa s bounds  @xcite on @xmath29 fluxes to within 20% .",
    "in contrast to ground arrays , the hadronic and em exposures of fluorescence detectors are very similar .",
    "fluorescence detectors are sensitive to the total em activity along the entire longitudinal development of the shower . in em showers ,",
    "essentially all of the energy produces em activity . in hadronic showers ,",
    "hadronic collisions produce equal numbers of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath30 decays to photons , producing em energy .",
    "however , the charged pions typically interact before decaying . through successive interactions ,",
    "most of their energy also becomes em activity . as a result ,",
    "roughly 90% of the energy in hadronic showers is em .",
    "the response and efficiency of fluorescence detectors to hadronic and em showers is therefore expected to be similar  @xcite . in this work we adopt the total fly s eye exposure reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for both hadronic and em showers .",
    "this exposure , given in fig .",
    "[ exposure ] , includes not only data from the first epoch of observation ( february 1983 to may 1985 ) , most of which were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but also data from four additional running periods between november 1985 to july 1992 .",
    "the additional periods enhance the total fly s eye exposure by roughly a factor of 3 .",
    "the agasa collaboration has searched for quasi - horizontal showers that are deeply - penetrating , with depth at shower maximum @xmath33  g/@xmath34  @xcite . at agasa , the location of the shower maximum is determined through its correlation to two measurable quantities :  @xmath35 , which parameterizes the lateral distribution of charged particles at ground level , and @xmath36 , which parameterizes the curvature of the shower front .",
    "deeply penetrating events must satisfy @xmath37 .",
    "the expected background from hadronic showers is @xmath38 , where the first uncertainty is from monte carlo statistics , and the second is systematic . among the 6 candidate events , 5 have values of @xmath39 and/or @xmath40 that barely exceed @xmath41 , and are well within @xmath42 of this value , where @xmath42 is the estimated precision with which @xmath43 can be reconstructed .",
    "the agasa collaboration thus concludes that there is no significant enhancement of deeply penetrating shower rates given the detector s resolution .",
    "the fly s eye observes an air shower as a nitrogen fluorescence light source traveling at the speed of light through the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "the light is emitted isotropically with intensity proportional to the number of charged particles in the shower .",
    "the received light profile is reconstructed by a 3 parameter fit to the charged particle density ( largely electrons and positrons ) along the shower track .",
    "the parameters are the depth of the observed first interaction @xmath44 ; the depth of the shower maximum @xmath45 ; and the density @xmath46 at @xmath47 . in a running time of eleven years , fly s eye recorded more than 5000 events . however , there are no neutrino candidates with shower maximum deeper than @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "all in all , given 1 event that unambiguously passes all cuts with 1.72 events expected from hadronic background , the combined results of agasa and fly s eye imply an upper bound of 3.5 events at 95% cl  @xcite from neutrino fluxes .",
    "the event rate for quasi - horizontal deep showers from ultra - high energy neutrinos is @xmath48 where the sum is over all neutrino species @xmath49 , and all final states @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is avogadro s number , and @xmath52 is the source flux of neutrino species @xmath53 . finally , @xmath54 is the appropriate exposure measured in @xmath55 .",
    "to clarify , we present appropriate exposures for some sm processes . at the ultra - high energies of interest , on average",
    "20% of the total neutrino energy goes into hadronic recoil for both sm neutral current and charged current events  @xcite .",
    "exposures for sm charged current events at agasa are therefore @xmath56 with identical expressions for anti - neutrinos .",
    "the exposures for @xmath57 and @xmath58 are identical , because at these energies , @xmath59 leptons typically do not decay before arriving at the earth s surface . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the expression includes the effects of saturation , noted previously .",
    "for agasa , the exposure saturates at @xmath60 at @xmath61 ( see fig .  [ exposure ] ) . for neutral current interactions at agasa ,",
    "all of the right - hand entries are @xmath62 .    for fly s eye ,",
    "the corresponding charged current exposures are simply @xmath63 for neutral current exposures at fly s eye , all of the right - hand entries are @xmath64 .    given the exposures @xmath65 described above , the absence of events implies upper bounds on cross sections , assuming some fixed flux , or upper bounds on fluxes , assuming some fixed cross section .",
    "we now consider these two possibilities in turn .",
    "to derive bounds on the neutrino flux , we assume sm charged and neutral current interactions for all neutrinos .",
    "we further assume that the source flux of neutrinos , which in the energy range of interest is dominantly @xmath57 , @xmath66 , and @xmath29 at production , is completely mixed in flavor upon arrival at the earth .",
    "there is now strong evidence for maximal mixing among all neutrino species  @xcite .",
    "in addition , given mass differences of @xmath67 , the neutrino flux is expected to be completely mixed if they travel a distance @xmath68 .",
    "the assumption of equal flavor representation upon arrival is therefore strongly supported by data  @xcite .",
    "we first derive model - independent bounds on the total neutrino flux .",
    "let us start by noting that if the number of events integrated over energy is bounded by 3.5 , then it is certainly true bin by bin in energy .",
    "thus , using eq .",
    "( [ numevents ] ) we obtain @xmath69 at 95% cl for some interval @xmath70 . here",
    "the sum over @xmath50 takes into account charge and neutral current processes . in a logarithmic interval @xmath70 where a single power law approximation @xmath71 is valid",
    ", a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes the quantity @xmath75 evaluated at the center of the logarithmic interval .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 , where the 0.363 is the power law index of the sm neutrino cross sections  @xcite , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the power law indices ( in the interval @xmath70 ) of the exposure and flux @xmath52 , respectively . since @xmath79 , a conservative bound may be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ bound ] ) and ( [ sinsh ] ) : @xmath80 in this work we choose @xmath81 , corresponding to one @xmath82-folding of energy , as a likely interval in which the single power law behavior is valid . by setting @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the total neutrino flux",
    ", we obtain model - independent upper limits on the total neutrino flux at 95% cl .",
    "the results are given in table  [ table ] .",
    ".model - independent upper limits on the differential neutrino flux at 95% cl . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these bounds assume that neutrinos produce deeply penetrating quasi - horizontal showers .",
    "they may be avoided if neutrinos are so strongly interacting that they shower high in the atmosphere . for zenith angles of @xmath9 ,",
    "this requires an interaction length below @xmath85 , corresponding to a cross section above @xmath86 .",
    "if the interaction length is between 3000 g/@xmath34 and the horizontal atmospheric depth of 36000 g/@xmath34 , corresponding to a @xmath87 cross section between @xmath88  pb and @xmath89  pb , respectively , an exponential decrease in the event rate for showers of a given total energy will be observed beyond a critical angle .",
    "since this range includes our upper bounds on @xmath90 at @xmath91 gev , it is conceivable that @xmath90 could thus be measured directly .",
    "bounds on anomalous @xmath87 cross sections which are near - hadronic strength can be obtained through considerations of their feedback to low energy physics via dispersion relations  @xcite .",
    "the bounds shown in table  [ table2 ] strengthen previous bounds  @xcite by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "this enhancement results from a number of factors .",
    "first , the exposure used in ref .",
    "@xcite was limited to the first @xmath92 of fly s eye operation .",
    "the updated exposure used here is roughly 9 times larger .",
    "second , the cosmogenic flux used in ref .  @xcite assumes a source cutoff energy of @xmath93 , and is smaller by roughly a factor of 4 than the one used here .",
    "we find it unnatural to assume that the the source cutoff coincides with the maximum observed cosmic ray energy , and so have used the flux corresponding to the larger cutoff energy .",
    "finally , we have presented 95% cl limits , corresponding to a limit of 3.5 events .    as in the case of flux bounds ,",
    "the model - independent cross section bounds of table  [ table2 ] will be improved if one assumes a cross section shape and so can integrate over all energies .",
    "we consider a particular example in the next section .",
    "the idea that our universe could be a brane embedded in some higher dimensional world has received a great deal of renewed attention over the last 5 years  @xcite . from a phenomenological point of view , this possibility presents a new perspective on the hierarchy between the gravitational and electroweak mass scales . in these scenarios ,",
    "the effective 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath94 is determined by the fundamental @xmath95-dimensional planck scale @xmath96 and the geometry of the @xmath97 extra dimensions .",
    "arguably the most fascinating prediction of tev - scale gravity is the production of black holes ( bhs ) in observable collisions of elementary particles  @xcite . for cosmic rays",
    ", this implies that ultra - high energy neutrinos may produce bhs in the atmosphere , initiating deep quasi - horizontal showers far above sm rate  @xcite .",
    "bh production therefore provides a specific example of a model - dependent cross section that is bounded by the arguments discussed above .",
    "tev - scale gravity also has a number of other implications for cosmic rays .",
    "the implications of perturbative kk graviton exchange has been considered in a number of scenarios  @xcite . however , for cosmic rays , in contrast to the case at colliders , there is an abundance of center - of - mass energy .",
    "extra dimensional effects will therefore first appear as non - perturbative bh production in processes with center - of - mass energies above the fundamental planck scale , rather than through perturbative effects below the planck scale .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case at colliders , where the sensitivity to kk graviton effects surpasses the sensitivity to bh production .",
    "the sensitivity of current cosmic ray experiments to bh production , as well as that of facilities expected in the not - too - distant future , has been thoroughly investigated  @xcite .",
    "the parton - parton cross section is estimated from the geometric area of the bh horizon and is of order @xmath98  @xcite , where @xmath99^{\\frac{1}{1+n } } \\left [ \\frac{2^n \\pi^{(n-3)/2}\\gamma({n+3\\over 2})}{n+2 } \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+n}}\\ ] ] is the radius of a schwarzschild bh in @xmath100 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "criticisms of the absorptive black disc scattering amplitude , which center on the exponential suppression of transitions involving a ( few - particle ) quantum state to a ( many - particle ) semiclassical state  @xcite , have been addressed in refs .",
    "the geometric cross section applies for both flat and hyperbolic  @xcite extra dimensions that are larger than the schwarzschild radius , and for warped extra dimensions where @xmath101 is small compared to the curvature scale of the geometry associated with the warped subspace  @xcite .",
    "the total production cross section for bhs with mass @xmath102 is then  @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 is the parton momentum fraction , the @xmath106 are parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , @xmath107 is the minimum bh mass , and the sum is carried out over all partons in the nucleon .",
    "the choice of the momentum transfer @xmath108 is governed by considering the time or distance scale probed by the interaction . according to thorne s hoop conjecture  @xcite ,",
    "the formation of a well - defined horizon in four dimensions occurs when the colliding particles are at a distance @xmath109 apart .",
    "( note that there could be an @xmath97-dependent factor for higher number of dimensions . )",
    "this has led to the advocacy of the choice @xmath110  @xcite , which has the advantage of a sensible limit at very high energies . however , as has been pointed out by dimopoulos and emparan  @xcite , string progenitors can give experimental signals akin to bh for the collision energies and values of @xmath111 under present consideration . in cosmic ray experiments , these signals are indistinguishable from those of bh decay ( more on this below ) .",
    "detailed calculations  @xcite show that these `` string ball '' cross sections can exceed bh cross sections . in this region , the dual resonance picture of string theory",
    "would suggest a choice @xmath112 since we have chosen to use only bh cross sections over the entire energy region , we set @xmath113 , where the upper limit is from the cteq5m1 distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "we are aware that for @xmath114 string scale , the pdf s will receive significant corrections from the rapid increase of degrees of freedom . fortunately , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section @xmath115 is largely insensitive to the details of the choice of @xmath116 for example , the two choices discussed here result in cross sections that differ by only 10% to 20% .",
    "once produced , bhs will hawking evaporate with a temperature proportional to the inverse radius @xmath117 .",
    "the wavelength @xmath118 corresponding to this temperature is larger than the bh size .",
    "hence , to first approximation the bh behaves like a point - radiator with entropy @xmath119 and mean lifetime @xmath120 microscopic black holes therefore decay almost instantaneously to a thermal distribution of sm particles .",
    "as very few sm particles are invisible to cosmic ray detectors , the neutrino energy is almost entirely transformed into shower energy .",
    "the em component of these showers differs substantially from that of sm neutrino interactions , allowing a good characterization of the phenomenon against background when the bh entropy  @xmath121 1  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been noted that bh recoil induced by kk - graviton emission may launch the bh out of the brane  @xcite . in this case , bh radiation would be prematurely terminated from the perspective of brane observers .",
    "this effect would drastically deplete the rate of deeply developing showers , and could be misinterpreted as a sharp cutoff on the ultra - high energy neutrino spectrum .",
    "we assume here that the effect of recoil is negligible .",
    "an important parameter in determining the bh cross section is @xmath122 , the ratio of the minimal black hole mass to the fundamental planck scale .",
    "the above description of bh production and decay relies on semi - classical arguments , valid for large @xmath123 or , equivalently , large bh entropy . for large @xmath123 , thermal fluctuations due to particle emission are small ( @xmath124 )  @xcite , statistical fluctuations in the microcanonical ensemble are small ( @xmath125 ) , and quantum gravity effects may be safely neglected .",
    "in addition , gravitational effects of the brane on bh production , which are ignored in all analyses to date , are expected to be insignificant for bh masses well above the brane tension , which is presumably @xmath126 .",
    "none of these is true for @xmath127 .",
    "cosmic ray experiments are largely insensitive to the exact details of bh decay .",
    "whatever happens near @xmath127 , it seems quite reasonable to expect that bhs or their planck mass progenitors will decay visibly , triggering deeply atmospheric cascade developments .",
    "there is , however , sensitivity to the bh production cross section . in string theory ,",
    "bh production is expected to gradually pass to the regime of string ball production as @xmath128 approaches @xmath0 .",
    "evidence from this picture suggests that the bh production cross section is not radically altered in this limit  @xcite .",
    "this addresses many of the concerns listed above , but does not address the problem of brane effects on bh production  these may still be large for @xmath127 . in our analysis , we avoid choosing a specific @xmath123 ; rather , we present results for the generous range @xmath129 .",
    "as we will see , the bounds are rather insensitive to @xmath123 , in contrast to the case at colliders such as the lhc .    in fig .",
    "[ limits ] we show the lower limit on @xmath130 as a function of @xmath123 corresponding to @xmath131 events ( 95% cl ) observed for the combined exposures of agasa and fly s eye .",
    "bounds on @xmath130 from table - top gravity experiments , as well as from astrophysical and cosmological considerations , greatly exceed 1 tev , for models with @xmath132 flat extra dimensions  @xcite . for @xmath133 , however , the bounds of fig .  [ limits ] are among the most stringent to date .",
    "note that these bounds do not depend on the shape of the extra dimensions and are valid for both warped and non - warped scenarios  @xcite . for @xmath134 , the bounds extend up to 2.0 tev for @xmath135 .",
    "moreover , assuming @xmath136 , for which the entropy @xmath137 , the bounds derived with the combined exposure , for @xmath138 , are @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "all of these exceed bounds from the tevatron and lep  @xcite , even in the case where the brane softening parameter @xmath140  @xcite is as large as @xmath130 ( see  @xcite for details).-brane production  @xcite in asymmetric compactifications . ]    in fig .",
    "[ sigmas ] we have also plotted the maximal bh cross section , corresponding to @xmath141 , for the case @xmath135 and @xmath142 . as expected , given a model for the cross section s energy dependence , the resulting bounds on new interactions are much more stringent than the model - independent limits derived above .",
    "finally , as noted above , the event rates for black hole production by cosmic rays are fairly insensitive to the choice of @xmath123 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the case at colliders .",
    "specifically , the total production cross section of a bh of mass @xmath143 in a @xmath144 collision is given by @xmath145 where @xmath59 is the parton - parton center - of - mass energy squared fraction , and @xmath146 is the minimum center - of - mass energy for which the black disc approximation is valid .",
    "the number of bh produced at the lhc ( @xmath147  tev and luminosity @xmath148  @xmath149  s@xmath150  @xcite ) is then @xmath151 in fig .",
    "[ fig : augerlhc_7 ] , we show both auger  @xcite and lhc event rates for various @xmath123 .",
    "for fixed @xmath130 , the lhc event rates drop by one to two orders of magnitude for every unit increase in @xmath123 , while the auguer event rates are relatively stable .",
    "this may be understood as resulting from a combination of the very high energies available in cosmic neutrinos and the fact that the parton energy is not degraded by a parton distribution function in the cosmic neutrino ` beam . '",
    "in the first part of this paper , we derived new limits on the cosmic neutrino flux striking the earth s atmosphere .",
    "this was accomplished by searching for quasi - horizontal deeply developing showers in ultra - high energy cosmic ray data , taking into account the combined exposures of the agasa and fly s eye experiments .",
    "our results significantly strengthen existing limits and present serious problems for models where exotic elementary @xmath50 particles cascade decay to cosmic ray particles .",
    "in particular , models where topological defects are responsible for the events detected with energies @xmath152 are severely constrained , because neutrinos are typically a significant component in @xmath50 decays , and have a hard spectrum extending up to @xmath153 .",
    "the bounds obtained in this paper will also challenge any attempt to normalize the observed spectrum to the proton flux as predicted by top down models .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we used the atmosphere as a giant calorimeter to probe neutrino - nucleon cross sections at @xmath154 .",
    "we first combined the complete neutrino exposure of the above - mentioned facilities with the flux of cosmogenic neutrinos , to derive model - independent upper bounds on the neutrino - nucleon cross section .",
    "these bounds strengthen existing limits by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "we then considered tev - scale gravity models to study bh production .",
    "the upper bounds on the neutrino - nucleon cross section implied lower limits on the fundamental planck scale , which represent the best existing limits on tev - scale gravity for @xmath155 extra spatial dimensions .",
