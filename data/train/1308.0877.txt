    "the sequence is called _ unimodular _ if @xmath11 for all @xmath2 .",
    "recently a. higashitani and m. masuda @xcite proved the following :    [ higashitani - masuda ] the rotation number of a unimodular sequence @xmath6 around the origin is given by @xmath12    when @xmath13 for all @xmath14 and the rotation number is one , theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] is well known and formulated as @xmath15 .",
    "it can be proved in an elementary way , but interestingly it can also be proved using toric geometry , to be more precise , by applying nther s formula to complete non - singular toric varieties of complex dimension two , see @xcite . when @xmath13 for all @xmath14 but the rotation number is not necessarily one , theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] was proved in @xcite using toric topology .",
    "the proof is a generalization of the proof above using toric geometry .",
    "the original proof of theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] by higashitani and masuda was a slight modification of the proof in @xcite but then they found an elementary proof .",
    "another elementary proof of theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] is given by r. t. zivaljevic @xcite .",
    "theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] does not hold when the unimodularity condition is dropped . in this paper",
    ", we give a formula on the rotation number of a ( not necessarily unimodular ) sequence of primitive vectors @xmath6 with @xmath16 for all @xmath14 , see theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "the proof is done by adding primitive vectors in an appropriate way to the given sequence so that the enlarged sequence is unimodular and then by applying theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] to the enlarged unimodular sequence .",
    "this combinatorial process , that is , making the given sequence to a unimodular sequence by adding primitive vectors corresponds to resolution of singularity by blow - up in geometry , see @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we state the main theorem and give an example . in section 3 , we discuss hirzebruch - jung continued fractions used in our proof of the main theorem . in section 4 , we give a proof of the main theorem .",

    "when @xmath32 , we can show that the assertion holds by a similar argument . since @xmath33 is primitive , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are relatively prime .",
    "note that @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , there exists a unique non - negative integer @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is a unimodular matrix .    since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are relatively prime , @xmath37 when @xmath38 and @xmath39 when @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath14 such that @xmath38 , let @xmath40 be the hirzebruch - jung continued fraction expansion .",
    "this continued fraction expansion is unique .",
    "we define @xmath41 when @xmath11 .",
    "[ a_i ] let @xmath3",
    ". then @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43    it is easy to check that @xmath44 dividing both sides by @xmath45 , we obtain ( [ a_i 2 ] ) .    the following is our main theorem :    [ main theorem ] let @xmath6 be a sequence of primitive vectors and @xmath46 , @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath47 , and @xmath48 be the integers defined in lemma [ x_i ] , ( [ y_i ] ) , and ( [ l_i ] ) .",
    "then the rotation number of the sequence @xmath6 around the origin is given by @xmath49    let @xmath50 and @xmath51 then we have the following :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         so we have @xmath52 therefore the value ( [ formula ] ) is @xmath53 , while the rotation number of the sequence @xmath54 in figure [ fig : one ] is clearly one .",

    "the following identity holds : @xmath78    let @xmath79 be the antihomomorphism defined by @xmath80 by lemma [ continued fraction 1 ] , we have @xmath81 proving the proposition .",
    "a similar assertion holds for regular continued fractions .",
    "let @xmath82 be a continued fraction expansion , and let @xmath58 be a unique positive integer such that @xmath83 .",
    "then the following identity holds : @xmath84 the proof is similar to lemma [ continued fraction 1 ] .",
    "the following identity can be deduced by taking transpose at the identity above : @xmath85",
    "in this section , we give a proof of theorem [ main theorem ] .",
    "we will use the notation in section 2 freely .",
    "we need the following lemma .",
    "[ xy ] for each @xmath2 , the following identity holds : @xmath86    if @xmath11 , then @xmath87 and the left hand side above is understood to be the identity matrix .",

    "we define @xmath91 note that both expressions at the right hand side of ( [ w ] ) are equal if @xmath92 . by the definition of @xmath93 , it follows that @xmath94 for any @xmath95 .",

    "theorem [ higashitani - masuda ] can be applied to an @xmath61-reflexive loop with respect to the sublattice generated by the vectors in the @xmath61-reflexive loop , but it is unclear whether the resulting formula can be obtained from theorem [ main theorem ] .",
