    "noises are inevitable and they cause errors in quantum informational processes . one active way of dealing with errors is provided by the quantum error - correcting codes ( qeccs ) @xcite , which have found many applications in quantum computations and quantum communications , such as the fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite , the quantum key distributions @xcite , and the entanglement purification @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "a qecc is a subspace of the hilbert space of a system of many physical subsystems with the property that the quantum data encoded in this subspace can be recovered faithfully , even though a certain number of physical subsystems may suffer arbitrary errors , by suitable syndrome measurements followed by corresponding unitary transformations .",
    "an important family of qeccs is the _ stabilizer code _ @xcite , which is specified by the joint + 1 eigenspace of a stabilizer , an abelian group of tensor products of pauli operators .",
    "the stabilizer formalism has also been established in the nonbinary case @xcite and many good codes for systems of a prime or a power of prime dimension have been constructed @xcite , including the well - known perfect code with five registers @xcite for all dimensions . though the majority of qeccs constructed",
    "so far are stabilizer codes , including the css codes @xcite , the topological codes @xcite , color codes @xcite , and also the recently introduced entanglement - assisted codes @xcite , there are a few exceptions called as _ nonadditive codes",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the nonadditive code does not admit a stabilizer structure and it should not be a subcode of some larger stabilizer code with the same distance otherwise it will be a trivial nonadditive code . though difficult to construct and identify the nonadditive codes promise a larger coding subspace since less structured than the stabilizer codes . for qubits",
    "the nonadditive error - correcting code that outperforms the stabilizer codes has been constructed @xcite based on the binary graph states .",
    "a graphical approach @xcite , as well as a codeword stabilized code approach @xcite , to the construction of binary additive and nonadditive codes has been developed based on the binary graph states .",
    "the graph states @xcite are useful multipartite entangled states that are essential resources for the one - way computing @xcite and can be experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the binary graph state proves to an extremely effective tool @xcite in the construction of qeccs .",
    "the nonbinary graph states were introduced first in @xcite and discussed in details in the case of systems of an odd prime dimension @xcite .",
    "it is also investigated in the context of universal quantum computation @xcite and other applications @xcite .",
    "recently an approach to construct qeccs based on nonbinary graph states has been introduced in @xcite and some new codes are found via computer search for qubits and qutrits .    here",
    "we shall generalize the graphical construction of qeccs @xcite to the nonbinary case based on the nonbinary graph states from which some analytic constructions are attainable . in sec.ii",
    "the nonbinary graph states are introduced . in sec.iii",
    "we introduce the concept of coding clique for a weighted graph and show how it is related to the construction of both stabilizer and nonadditive qeccs .",
    "in sec.iv we present some codes found via numerical searches and the graphical versions of some known codes as illustrations . in sec.v",
    "we construct analytically four families of optimal stabilizer codes that saturate the quantum singleton bound for any odd dimension as well as a family of nonadditive codes @xmath5 for all @xmath6 . in sec.vi",
    "we investigate the graphical codes arising from composite systems and construct a family of stabilizer codes @xmath7 with @xmath4 being odd .",
    "the graph states of systems composed of coprimed subsystems are in a one - to - one correspondence with the direct product of the graph states of subsystems .",
    "here we shall consider a general system with @xmath4 levels , a _",
    "qupit _ for short , where @xmath4 is arbitrary .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the ring with addition modulo @xmath4 . under the computational basis @xmath9 of a qupit , the generalized bit shift and phase shift operators read @xmath10 obviously @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the hermitian conjugate of @xmath14 . the computational basis @xmath15 is the eigenstate of @xmath16 with eigenvalue @xmath17 while the eigenstate of @xmath14 with eigenvalue @xmath18 reads @xmath19    a @xmath20-weighted graph @xmath21 is composed of a set @xmath22 of @xmath23 vertices and a set of weighted edges specified by the _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath24 , an @xmath25 matrix with zero diagonal entries and the matrix element @xmath26 denoting the weight of the edge connecting vertices @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "the non - binary graph state @xmath39 is also the unique ( up to a global phase factor ) joint @xmath40 eigenstate of the following @xmath23 vertex stabilizers @xmath41    for @xmath42 we denote @xmath43 and similarly for the phase shift operator @xmath44 . obviously @xmath45 is also a stabilizer of the graph state for arbitrary @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 .",

    "from the standard theory of the qecc we know that if a set of pauli errors can be corrected then all the errors can also be corrected . the situation in non - binary case is the same , because the nonbinary error basis defined by @xmath63 is a nice basis @xcite , i.e. , the set @xmath64 forms a basis for the operators acting on the @xmath23-qupit hilbert space @xmath49 .    for a given weighted graph @xmath21 , from the definition the vertex stabilizers of a graph state",
    ", we have @xmath65 that is to say every non - binary pauli error acting on the graph state @xmath39 can be equivalently replaced by some qupit phase flip errors , up to some phase factors . for convenience",
    "we refer that the vector @xmath66 is _ covered _ by the error @xmath67 .",
    "given an integer @xmath68 we introduce a _",
    "@xmath68-uncoverable set _ as @xmath69 where we have denoted by @xmath70 the support of a vector @xmath71 and by @xmath72 the number of the elements in @xmath73 . that is to say @xmath74 is the set of all the @xmath68-uncoverable vectors , i.e.",
    ", vectors can not be covered by pauli errors acting nontrivially on less then @xmath68 qupits , in @xmath54 .",
    "in addition we define the _ @xmath68-purity set _ as @xmath75 it is obvious that if @xmath76 then the graph stabilizer @xmath77 has a support less than @xmath68 , i.e. , act nontrivially on less than @xmath68 qupits .    a _ coding clique _ @xmath78 of a given graph @xmath21 is a collection of @xmath52 different vectors in @xmath79 that satisfy :    * @xmath80 ; * @xmath81 for all @xmath82 and every @xmath83 ; * @xmath84 for all @xmath85 .",
    "if the coding clique @xmath78 forms a group with respect to the addition modulo @xmath4 , then it will be referred to as a _ coding group_. in words , a coding clique @xmath86 is a collection of @xmath52 @xmath68-uncoverable vectors in @xmath54 that is orthogonal to the vectors in @xmath87 and the difference between any two vectors in @xmath88 is also @xmath68-uncoverable .",
    "we can build a super graph @xmath89 with vertices being the vectors in @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath68-uncoverable vectors that are orthogonal to all the vectors in @xmath87 , and two vertices in the super graph are connected by an edge iff their difference is also @xmath68-uncoverable .",
