    "the conventional mathematical basis for weak lensing analysis assumes that a shear field causes an additional ellipticity to the shape of a background source , which can be calculated by measuring the moments of the images @xcite .",
    "however , this approach does not account for higher - order shape distortions that occur when there are strong tidal fields across the image .",
    "recently , an additional lensing effect called flexion has been investigated as an extension to shear - based measurements @xcite .",
    "flexion has two components denoted first and second flexion , which are a shift of the image centroid and a representation of the `` arciness '' of the image respectively .",
    "one main issue associated with shear - based gravitational lensing is that galaxies are intrinsically elliptical in shape ( ellipses at some inclination to the line - of - sight seen in projection ) , so it is necessary to disentangle lens - induced shear from the intrinsic shape .",
    "resolved galaxies , however , are not intrisincally flexed  although systems undergoing a merger , or galaxies with substantial asymmetric sub - structure such as a large starforming region , may be mis - intepreted as flexion signals .",
    "it has been suggested that flexion may provide a stronger constraint on dark matter @xcite , galaxy cluster mass models @xcite and also on _ delensing _ gravitational wave signals @xcite than shear on its own , notwithstanding the challenges in measuring flexion ( e.g. okura , umetsu & futamase 2007 , 2008 ; goldberg & leonard 2007 ; massey et al .",
    "2007 ; irwin & shmakova 2006 ; schneider & er 2008 ) .    in a previous paper we presented analytic flexion results for a range of popular mass density profiles : schwarzschild lens , singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile and srsic - like profiles ( lasky & fluke 2009 ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "our analytic solutions present a flexion formalism where we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) field in the lens plane , which allows for the treatement of extended sources . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous work by considering the following key question : over what range of image / source sizes is the flexion approach valid ?",
    "that is , if flexion appears as a gradient of shear across an image , which is implictly assumed to be zero for traditional weak - lensing analysis , how well can we recover flexion for extended sources ?",
    "the approach we use is via the ray - bundle method introduced by fluke , webster & mortlock ( 1999 ) . here",
    ", bundles of light rays with a known initial configuration are propagated through one or more lens planes , and the deflection of each light ray is determined using the gravitational lens equation , see equation ( [ eqn : tle ] ) below .",
    "the initial and final shapes of the bundles can now be used to obtain numerical estimates for convergence , shear , magnification , first and second flexion as a function of source size . by starting with simple lens models ,",
    "we use known analytic results to test the accuracy of our approach , and hence assess its applicability to cases where analytic flexion results do not exist ( e.g. asymmetric mass profiles , such as from @xmath5-body , dark matter halo simulations ) .",
    "the paper is set out as follows : in section [ sct : flexform ] , we summarise the key results for the analytic flexion formalism . in section [ sct : rbm ] , we describe how the ray - bundle method can be used to obtain flexion along individual lines - of - sight .",
    "we present the results of our numerical testing , and determine a range of image locations and bundle radii for which the flexion approximation is valid for a schwarzschild lens model .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a flexion zone , which defines a physical region where the flexion formalism is valid for extended sources . in section [ sct : discussion ] we present calculations of the size of the flexion zone as a function of lens mass , lens and source redshift .",

    "in this section , we summarise relevant results of the flexion formalism  for full details , see paper i and references therein .",
    "the thin - lens gravitational lens equation relates the location of a background source and its image(s ) due to an intervening mass distribution : @xmath6 for the simple case of a single lens at the origin of the lens plane , @xmath7 is the image location in the image plane , @xmath8 is the source location in the source plane , and @xmath9 is the deflection angle . throughout this paper , indices",
    "@xmath10 signify the two - dimensional components , with summation assumed over repeated indices , and tensors are implicity functions of the image position , @xmath11 , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "the thin - lens approximation requires that the spatial extent of the lens distribution be much smaller than the angular diameter distances between the observer and lens , @xmath12 , observer and source , @xmath13 , and lens to source , @xmath14 .",
    "a convenient scaling of the lens equation into angular coordinates uses the substitutions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , so we have the compact form : @xmath18 we introduce a further scaling for the lens equation in section 3.4 .      as a mapping between the lens and source planes , equation ( [ eqn : angle ] )",
    "is often rewritten in terms of its jacobian matrix : @xmath19 where the matrix elements are identified with the convergence , @xmath20 , and two orthogonal components of shear , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the magnification along a given line - of - sight , @xmath23 , is related to the area distortion of the lens mapping : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the total shear is @xmath25 .    by setting the location of the light ray as the origin of coordinates in the lens and source planes ,",
    "one finds for small changes in the position of the light ray : @xmath26 the interpretation of this mapping is as follows : if the gradients of the shear and convergence do not change significantly across the image , then the first - order weak lensing effect is to produce an additional ellipticity in the shape of background sources .",
    "while this approach is satisfactory for point sources , it breaks down for extended sources .",
    "this is seen even for the conceptually simplest lens model , the point mass or schwarzschild lens , which produces increasingly `` arcy '' images for extended sources at small impact parameters to the lens .    in order to account for the effects of gradients in the shear and convergence ,",
    "a second - order taylor expansion of the gravitational field is required : @xmath27 following the approach of @xcite , the tensor term , @xmath28 , is associated with two additional lensing distortion terms @xmath29 by further defining @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we note that the components of first ( @xmath32 ) and second ( @xmath33 ) flexion can be written : @xmath34 the components of first and second flexion only require a subset of the tensor components , @xmath28 , and do not depend on knowledge of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 or @xmath38 .",
    "the relevance of this is discussed in section [ sct : quant ] .      for a circularly symmetric mass profile ,",
    "the deflection angle is @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the projected mass , @xmath41 , is @xmath42 for surface density , @xmath43 .",

    "in this section , we describe how the ray - bundle method can be used as a numerical means of estimating flexion along a given line - of - sight .",
    "we use the schwarzschild lens model ( hereafter , sl ) , as it provides us with simple analytic solutions for all of the relevant lensing properties .",
    "however , since the sl has zero first flexion everywhere except at the origin , we emphasise the recovery of second flexion with the rbm , whilst demonstrating that results remain consistent with zero first flexion .",
    "we consider both backwards ( lens plane to source plane ) and forwards ( source plane to lens plane ) ray - bundle propagation , as this separately allows us to constrain the appropriate bundle radius to use and to quantify the extent of the flexion zone .      while knowledge of an image location uniquely defines the source location , in general , equation ( [ eqn : tle ] ) is not easily invertible to give all image locations for a given source position .",
    "while `` brute force '' solution methods can be used ( e.g. paczyski 1986 ) , the main alternative is to use inverse ray - tracing in its direct form , as was introduced by kayser , refsdal & stabell ( 1986 ) and schneider & weiss ( 1986;1987 ) , or in its hierachical tree - code form ( wambsganss 1990;1999 ) . here",
    ", light rays are projected backwards from the observer , through the lens plane to the source plane , which is represented by a two - dimensional grid of source pixels .",
    "the deflection of each light ray is calculated with equation ( [ eqn : tle ] ) .",
    "while ray - tracing methods are extremely well - suited to studying statistical lensing effects ( e.g. the creation of magnification maps for studying probabilities of high magnification events in quasar microlensing ) , they are less well - suited for studying lensing effects along a given line - of - sight .",
    "if it were possible to write down an explicit analytic form for the null geodesic equation of general relativity for an arbitrary mass ( i.e. lens ) distribution , the optical scalar equations ( sachs 1961 ; dyer & roeder 1974 ) could be used to measure the changing shape of a ( small ) bundle of light rays as it propagates from the source to the observer .",
    "unfortunately , specific solutions only exist for a limited number of cases , such as light propogation in swiss cheese `` inhomogeneous '' cosmological models ( harper 1991 ) , so an alternative approach is required .",
    "the ray - bundle method ( rbm ) was developed as an alternative to grid - based inverse ray - tracing for studying gravitational lensing along specified sightlines ( fluke , webster & mortlock 1999 ) .",
    "an image shape is defined in the image plane ( or first lens plane in the case of multiple lens planes ) , comprising a central light ray , which represents the `` null geodesic '' , surrounded by a bundle of @xmath48 light rays .",
    "the light rays in this bundle are traced backwards to the source plane , producing a distorted source shape . as such",
    ", rbm provides a numerical analogy to the optical scalar solution , while retaining properties of the inverse ray - tracing approach , such as the use of the thin lens equation for deflection calculations .    in earlier work ( fluke , webster & mortlock 2002 ) ,",
    "the rbm was used to obtain magnification probability distributions for dark matter - only cosmological models .",
    "however , the rbm s emphasis on bundle shape means it is ideally suited for studying both linear and higher - order gravitational lensing phenomena ( viz . shear and flexion ) in detail along any given line - of - sight .",
    "shapes in the image and source planes showing non - linear lensing effects for extended image / source pairs . for the simplest case of a schwarzschild lens , a circular image is mapped to a `` teardrop '' source ( top row ) , and a circular source is mapped to an arc - like image ( bottom row ) .",
    ", width=288 ]    moreover , the rbm gives a great deal of flexibility in choosing the size and shape of the initial bundle ( i.e. the image ) , so that we can constrain the length - scale over which the flexion approximation of equation ( [ eqn : dijk ] ) is valid .",
    "if the gradient of the shear and convergence across an image is negligible , i.e. we are in the regime of equation ( [ eqn : delta ] ) , which is the truly weak - field limit of gravitational lensing , then a circular source will appear as an elliptical image , and a circular image would be indicative of an intrinsically elliptical source .",
    "when tidal gradients _ do _ occur across an image , most readily due to the extended nature of image / source pairs , the relationship betwen image and source shapes is less obvious . for the sl ,",
    "circular sources are mapped to `` arc - like '' images , and circular images are due to `` teardrop '' shaped sources .",
