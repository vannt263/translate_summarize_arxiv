    "in addition to proving conditions which guarantee the existence and uniqueness of an attractor for a projective ifs , we also present several related concepts . the first connects an attractor which avoids a hyperplane with a hyperplane repeller .",
    "the second uses information about the hyperplane repeller to define a new index for an attractor .",
    "this index is both invariant under projective transformations and nontrivial , which implies that it joins the cross ratio and hausdorff dimension as nontrivial invariants under the projective group .",
    "thus , these attractors belong in a natural way to the collection of geometrical objects of classical projective geometry .",
    "the definitions that support expressions such as `` iterated function system '' , `` attractor '' , `` basin of attraction '' and `` avoids a hyperplane '' , used in this introduction , are given in section [ hilbert ] .",
    "iterated function systems are a standard framework for describing and analyzing self - referential sets such as deterministic fractals @xcite and some types of random fractals @xcite",
    ". attractors of affine ifss have many applications , including image compression @xcite and geometric modeling @xcite .",
    "they relate to the theory of the joint spectral radius @xcite and to wavelets @xcite .",
    "projective ifss have more degrees of freedom than comparable affine ifss @xcite while the constituent functions share geometrical properties such as preservation of straight lines and cross ratios .",
    "projective ifss have been used in digital imaging and computer graphics , see for example @xcite , and they may have applications to image compression , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "projective ifss can be designed so that their attractors are smooth objects such as arcs of circles and parabolas , and rough objects such as fractal interpolation functions .",
    "the behavior of attractors of projective ifss appears to be complicated . in computer experiments conducted by the authors , attractors seem to come and",
    "go in a mysterious manner as parameters of the ifs are changed continuously .",
    "see example 4 in section [ examplesec ] for an example that illustrates such phenomena .",
    "the intuition developed for affine ifss regarding the control of attractors seems to be wrong in the projective setting .",
    "our theorems provide insight into such behavior .",
    "one key issue is the relationship between the existence of an attractor and the contractive properties of the functions of the ifs . in a previous paper @xcite we investigated the relationship between the existence of attractors and the existence of contractive metrics for ifss consisting of affine maps on @xmath7 .",
    "we established that an affine ifs @xmath8 has an attractor if and only if @xmath8 is contractive on all of @xmath7 . in the present paper we focus on the setting where @xmath9 is real @xmath10-dimensional projective space and each function in @xmath8 is a projective transformations . in this case",

    "when these statements are true we say that @xmath8 is contractive .",
    "statement ( 4 ) is of particular importance because if an ifs is contractive , then it possesses an attractor that depends continuously on the functions of the ifs , see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.11 ) .",
    "moreover , if an ifs is contractive , then various canonical measures , supported on its attractor , can be computed by means of the `` chaos game '' algorithm @xcite , and diverse applications , such as those mentioned above , become feasible .",
    "note that statement ( 4 ) of theorem  [ main ] immediately implies uniqueness of an attractor in the set @xmath19 , but not uniqueness in @xmath18 .",

    "more specifically , if an attractor @xmath5 avoids a hyperplane then @xmath5 lies in the complement of ( the union of the hyperplanes in ) the repeller . since the connected components of this complement form an open cover of @xmath5 and since @xmath5 is compact , @xmath5 is actually contained in a finite set of components of the complement .",
