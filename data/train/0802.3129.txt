    "in this paper we present and analyze an explicit finite difference scheme for the camassa - holm partial differential equation @xcite @xmath1 which we augment with an initial condition : @xmath2 rewriting equation as @xmath3 + { \\partial_x } \\left(u^2+\\frac{1}{2 }    ( { \\partial_x } u)^2\\right)=0,\\ ] ] we see that ( for smooth solutions ) is equivalent to the elliptic - hyperbolic system @xmath4 recalling that @xmath5 is the green s function of the operator @xmath6 , can be written as @xmath7,\\ ] ] which can be viewed as a conservation law with nonlocal flux function . in this paper",
    "the relevant formulation of the camassa - holm equation is the one provided by the hyperbolic - elliptic system or .",
    "the camassa - holm equation can be viewed as a model for the propagation of unidirectional shallow water waves @xcite ; it is a member of the class of weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive shallow water models , a class which already contains the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) and benjamin - bona - mahony ( bbm ) equations . in another interpretation",
    "the camassa - holm equation models finite length , small - amplitude radial deformation waves in cylindrical compressible hyperelastic rods @xcite .",
    "it arises also in the context of differential geometry as an equation for geodesics of the @xmath0-metric on the diffeomorphism group , see for example @xcite .",
    "the camassa - holm equation possesses several striking properties such as an inifinite number of conserved integrals , a bi - hamiltonian structure , and complete integrability @xcite .",
    "moreover , it enjoys an infinite number of non - smooth solitary wave solutions , called peakons , which are weak solutions of .    from a mathematical point of view",
    "the camassa - holm equation has by now become rather well - studied .",
    "while it is impossible to give a complete overview of the mathematical literature , we shall here mention a few typical results , starting with the local(-in - time ) existence results in @xcite and those using besov spaces in @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that global solutions do not exist and wave - breaking occurs @xcite .",
    "wave - breaking means that the solution itself stays bounded while the spatial derivative becomes unbounded in finite time .    in view of what we have said so far ( peakon solutions / wave - breaking )",
    "it is clear that a theory based on weak solutions is essential . in the literature",
    "there are a number of results on ( dissipative and conservative ) weak solutions of the camassa - holm equation , see @xcite and the references cited therein . in this paper",
    "we are interested specifically in the class of _ dissipative weak solutions",
    "_ studied by xin and zhang @xcite .",
    "their results show , among other things , that there exists a global dissipative weak solution of - for any @xmath0 initial data @xmath8 ( peakon - antipeakon interactions are covered ) .",
    "these solutions are global in the sense that they are defined past the blow - up time ( wave - breaking ) .",
    "more precisely , suppose @xmath9 .",
    "then there exists a global weak ( distributional ) solution @xmath10 of satisfying the following properties : @xmath11 is non - increasing ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 ; @xmath14 for some positive constant @xmath15 .",
    "this last item presumably singles out a unique weak solution . as an example of how this may work we",
    "consider the `` peakon - antipeakon '' solution given by @xmath16 this formula represents a peakon ( @xmath17 ) colliding with an antipeakon ( @xmath18 ) at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 .",
    "how this solution is extended to @xmath22 depends on which solution concept we adopt .",
    "if we use the formula also for @xmath22 we get the conservative solution for which @xmath23 is constant for almost all @xmath24 .",
    "we can also extend the solution by defining @xmath25 for @xmath22 .",
    "obviously , the `` entropy condition '' will only be satisfied for this dissipative solution .",
    "let us now turn to the topic of the present paper , which is the design and analysis of numerical schemes .",
    "the first numerical results for the camassa - holm equation are presented in @xcite using a pseudo - spectral scheme .",
    "numerical simulations with pesudo - spectral schemes are also reported in @xcite .",
    "numerical schemes based on multipeakons ( thereby exploiting the hamiltonian structure of the camassa - holm equation ) are examined in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors prove that the multipeakon algorithm from @xcite converges to the solution of the camassa - holm equation as the number of peakons tends to infinity .",
    "this convergence result applies to the specific situation where the initial function @xmath26 is such that @xmath27 is a positive measure . for the same class of initial data , in @xcite",
    "the authors prove that a semi - discrete finite difference scheme based on the variable @xmath28 converges strongly in @xmath0 to the weak solution identified in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors establish error estimates for a spectral projection scheme for smooth solutions . in a different direction , an adaptive high - resolution",
    "finite volume scheme is developed and used in @xcite .",
    "the local discontinuous galerkin method is adapted to the camassa - holm equation in @xcite .",
    "although this work does not provide a rigorous convergence result for general ( non - smooth ) solutions , they show that the discrete total energy is nonincreasing in time , thereby suggesting that the approximate solutions are of dissipative nature .",
    "besides , they establish an error estimate for smooth solutions . finally , multi - symplectic schemes possessing good conservative properties are suggested and demonstrated in the recent work @xcite .",
    "it seems rather difficult to construct numerical schemes for which one can prove the convergence to a ( non - smooth ) solution of the camassa - holm equation .",
    "this statement is particularly accurate in the case of general @xmath0 initial data and peakon - antipeakon interactions .",
    "indeed , in this context we are only aware of the recent work @xcite in which we prove convergence of a tailored semi - discrete difference scheme to a dissipative weak solution .",
    "before we can outline this scheme , let us discretize the spatial domain @xmath29 by specifying the mesh points @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the length between two consecutive mesh points ( the spatial discretization parameter ) .",
    "let @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denote the corresponding backward , central , and forward difference operators , respectively .",
    "the scheme proposed in @xcite , which is based on the formulation , reads @xmath37 where @xmath38    if we interpret the camassa - holm equation as a  perturbation \" of the inviscid burgers equation , then the @xmath39-part of might not come across as a reasonable ( upwind ) difference scheme . on the other hand ,",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the key point is that with the quantity @xmath40 satisfies a difference scheme which contains proper upwinding of the transport term in the equation for @xmath41 , which reads @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , as is proved in @xcite , the scheme satisfies a total energy inequality , in which only the @xmath43-part of the total energy is dissipated ( not the @xmath39-part , which is after all continuous ) .",
    "this is the essential starting point for the entire convergence analysis in @xcite .",
    "the  semi - discrete \" equation in constitutes an infinite system of ordinary differential equations which must be solved by some numerical method .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to show that a fully discrete version of the scheme used in @xcite produces a convergent sequence of approximate solutions , and that the limit is a dissipative weak solution to . the fully discrete version that is analyzed in this paper",
    "is based on replacing the time derivative in by a forward difference , i.e. , @xmath44 and evaluating the rest of at @xmath45 .",
    "now @xmath46 should approximate the exact solution @xmath39 at the point @xmath47 .",
    "this gives the fully discrete scheme @xmath48 where @xmath49 approximates @xmath50 .",
    "as in @xcite this is a difference scheme which is tailored so that it gives an upwind scheme for the equation satisfied by @xmath41 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is prove that the fully discrete ( explicit ) scheme converges to a dissipative weak solution of the camassa - holm equation .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is a total energy estimate , showing that the @xmath0 norm of the approximate solutions is ( almost ) nonincreasing in time . to this end",
    ", we must assume that @xmath51 for some @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "this is a very severe condition , and it may seem that when using this method in practice one should use very small time steps .",
    "however , this is not a neumann type stability criterion , and we do not have blow up if it is violated . indeed , practical experiments indicate stability and convergence if @xmath54 .    by appropriately extending the difference solution to a function @xmath55 defined at all points @xmath56 in the domain ,",
    "we prove under condition that @xmath57 converges strongly in @xmath0 to a dissipative weak solution of the camassa - holm equation - . regarding the proof ,",
    "we adapt the  renormalization \" approach used in @xcite for the semi - discrete scheme , but there are several essential deviations and many parts of the convergence proof are substantially more involved and/or different .",
    "these differences are mainly due to the fact that the semi - discrete scheme , when viewed as a fully discrete scheme with `` infinitely small time steps '' , has a large and stabilizing numerical viscosity .",
    "regarding the fully discrete ( explict ) scheme , to account for this lack of numerical viscosity the convergence analysis relies heavily on the cfl condition and differennt with reference to the differences between the semi - discrete and fully discrete schemes , let us here point out just one aspect , namely that the @xmath0 norm of the fully discrete approximation is not entirely nonincreasing but can grow slightly with a growth factor that , however , tends to zero as @xmath58 .",
    "compared to semi - implcit case @xcite , the proof is notably more complicated and involves working with a version of the scheme in which the quadratic terms have been suitably truncated .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : prelim ] we introduce some notation to improve the readability and recall a few mathematical results relevant for the convergence analysis . the finite difference scheme and its convergence theorem are stated in section [ sec : diffscheme ] .",
    "the convergence theorem is a consequence of the results proved in sections [ sec : enest]-[sec : strongconv ] .",
    "finally , we present a numerical example in section [ sec : numex ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath15 to denote a generic constant ; the actual value of @xmath15 may change from one line to the next in a calcuation .",
