    "one of the important issues in understanding massive star formation is the sequence of formation of low and high mass stars in a cluster forming environment @xcite .",
    "this issue has relevance when explaining the nature of massive star formation in terms of either : ( a ) low to intermediate mass stars accumulating matter while evolving toward the main sequence , or ( b ) competitive accretion of massive cores in a star forming cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of embedded clusters generally display mass segregated configurations , with a few young high mass stars located at the cluster centers ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "although an age estimation for the lower mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) population is possible using evolutionary tracks and colour - magnitude ( cm ) diagrams , the same is not true for massive stars , since they are usually only a few in number .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to investigate clusters around high mass protostellar object candidates , where the youth of the massive stars is made clear by various other signposts , such as outflows , compact hii regions , excess fir emission , and so on .",
    "@xcite searched for clustering around a sample of high mass protostellar objects and found 54 embedded clusters among 215 candidates .",
    "the detection of clustering in about 25% of the sources ( all targets located away from the galactic mid - plane ) suggests that at least one generation of low mass stars has already formed around these massive protostellar candidates .",
    "however , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) data used by these authors did not effectively uncover the lower mass population ; the 2mass data were not deep enough to characterise the remaining cluster members .",
    "in contrast , a follow - up of the same data sets by @xcite using the _ spitzer_-glimpse survey ( @xcite ) did not find any clustering for the sources in the galactic mid - plane . this mid - infrared survey should have been more successful at finding clusters because of the better dust penetration .    in this paper , using high quality optical and infrared observations of a high mass protostellar object in the galactic mid - plane , we attempt to examine such discrepancies , measure the stellar content , and understand the sequence of low and high mass star formation in the associated cluster .",
    "the high quality nir photometric and spectroscopic data are combined with _",
    "irac and mips observations to study the target .",
    "study of the massive star content is particularly aided by radiative transfer modelling of the sed .",
    "the target , iras 19343 + 2026 , is a high mass protostellar object candidate located at a kinematic distance ( measured using nh@xmath7 line velocities ) of 4.2 kpc , with a fir luminosity of 2.7@xmath810@xmath9 l@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this cluster is detected in the glimpse survey ( cluster 24 of @xcite ) .",

    "an integration time of 60 sec was used in each of the @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath5 band filters ; averaging jittered exposures yielded a total exposure time of 540 seconds in each band .",
    "the mean seeing measured was 0.6@xmath12 in the @xmath5-band images . a nine point ( 3@xmath83 ) jittered observing sequence was executed to obtain data that provided final mosaics with a total fov of @xmath2115@xmath23115@xmath12 .",

    "we adopt a slope consistent with @xmath40 = 1.9 ( bb system ) , which is appropriate to an interstellar reddening law of r = 3.12 @xcite .",
    "the cc diagram was used to identify the reddened population that falls in the region occupied by t tauri and haebe stars .",
    "stars that lie outside the region of reddened main - sequence objects ( i.e. redward of the reddening line drawn from the base of the main - sequence dwarf branch , that is , redward of the middle of the three vectors ) are ysos with intrinsic colour excesses",

    "by de - reddening the stars on the cc diagram that fall within the first two reddening vectors ( encompassing the main - sequence and giant stars ) to the dwarf locus , a visual extinction ( @xmath41 ) for each star was calculated .",

    "_ middle panel _ )",
    "it is possible to clearly identify the dwarf and giant branches of the stellar population , i.e. sources with an @xmath43 colour of less than 1.0 .",
    "in contrast , the cluster region ( _ left panel _ ) displays the dwarf branch ( the group of stars running vertically at @xmath43 @xmath2 0.4 ) and a significant number of stars with @xmath43 colours around 1 .",
    "these stars are essentially cluster members which are also identified on the cc diagram as probable cluster members .",
    "the control field also has very few stars with @xmath43 @xmath26 1 as compared to the cluster region .",
    "therefore , we find that the contamination from foreground / background stars in our cluster region is minimal compared to the statistics of the probable cluster members .",
    "however , @xmath43 colour alone is no good for distinguishing between a reddened background star and a young star .",
    "therefore , we have used a statistical approach to remove contaminating field stars from the @xmath42 cm diagram of the cluster region ( we will discuss this further in detail in the following sect . 3.2 ) .",
    "the cluster member stars are clearly seen in the statistically cleaned cm diagram ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "our aim here is to estimate the approximate age of the lower mass population by comparing our data with theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "the low mass evolutionary tracks have been tested on various observational data of young stellar clusters and are thought to be good representations .",
    "the evolutionary models for high mass stars are more complicated and varied , however , and are not well tested against observational data sets .",
    "therefore , we first use the pre - main - sequence ( pms ) isochrone fitting for the lower mass population .",
    "further , it should be noted that a cm diagram that uses only one colour may not be very effective in describing the less understood massive young stars .",
    "since the stellar photosphere s are better represented by shorter wavelength data such as the optical , @xmath14 and @xmath17 bands , we use these data when comparing source photometry with the model isochrones . in the region of fig .",
    "1 , all optically detected stars in the @xmath44 bands were plotted on a @xmath45 vs @xmath46 cm diagram .",
    "all but seven of the optically detected stars are foreground stars .",

    "6 . in this plot",
    "the slanting arrow denotes the reddening vector associated with 15 mag of extinction .",
    "ysos identified in the @xmath37 cc diagram in fig.4 are shown as open circles ; triangles mark the bright stars .",
    "pms evolutionary tracks @xcite for ages 1 , 3 and 5 myrs are shown in fig . 6 with dotted , short - dashed , and long - dashed lines , respectively . we have assumed a distance of 4.2 kpc @xcite and have reddened the isochrones with the average extinction of @xmath48 = 7.6 mag estimated from the @xmath37 cc diagram analysis in sect .",
    "3.1 . given the poor statistics for this distant cluster , it is not easy to derive the age by isochrone fitting . even for regions with good statistics ,",
    "it is quite difficult to constrain the age because most low mass stars spend the bulk of their pms time on the hayashi track , which is the _ vertical _ part of each isochrone .",
    "however , a small fraction of observed young stars will coincide with the brief evolutionary phase associated with the henyey track , which is the _ horizontal _ transition between the hayashi track and the zero - age - main sequence ( zams ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "6 we note that there is a large population of low mass / low @xmath14 magnitude candidate young stars ( open circles ) that lie to the _ right _ of the 1 myr isochrone ( dotted line )",
    ". some of these sources may be class i protostars associated with the cluster",
    ". however , most will be class ii sources ( t tauri stars ) with an age of about 1 myr ; many of these sources lie to the right of the 1 myr isochrone because of extinction which , to these embedded sources , will be higher than the @xmath48 @xmath2 8 mags used to deredden the pms isochrones . however , there is also a population of candidate low mass young stars that lie to the _ left _ of the 1 myr isochrone .",
    "these sources represent a more evolved group of young stars that are probably 3 myr or older . indeed , there are five probable cluster members that align horizontally and may therefore represent the henyey part of the 3 myr isochrone ( short dash ) .",
    "hence , we estimate that there is a low mass population of stars associated with iras 19343 + 2026 that is best represented by an age of 1 myr or more . the mass range plotted in the figure is from 0.6  to 3.0   for the 3 myr isochrone .",
    "the 5 myr isochrone ( long dash ; mass range 0.6  2.5 ) may well be within the age spread of the cluster .",

    "the slanting solid line shows the reddening vector . ]",
    "one should also note that the @xmath14 vs @xmath47 diagram contains only 333 sources that are common to the @xmath14 and @xmath17 bands .",
    "this is a considerable under - representation of the full sample , given that 875 sources are detected in the @xmath5 band and that many of the fainter , redder sources will be detected only at longer wavelengths . nevertheless , the sample is statistically significant when comparing with evolutionary tracks and obtaining an age estimate for the low mass sources in this region .      as a next step to better understanding this region ,",
    "we evaluate the mass function of the cluster .",
    "in the nir , young stars are best detected in the @xmath5-band .",
    "consequently , we use the @xmath5-band luminosity function ( klf ) to evaluate this statistically important parameter . ideally , we want to build the klf using ufti data which has a higher spatial resolution compared to the ukidss data .",
    "but the estimate of the mass function should be compared with the mass function of the control field , which is not possible using ufti data , since we do not have control field images obtained with ufti .",
    "the number of sources detected in the ufti and ukidss images is very similar ( to within 5% ) for the same fov .",
    "therefore , we will evaluate the initial mass function ( imf ) using the ukidss data which is uniformly calibrated for both the cluster and control regions .    by using the control region comparison ,",
    "the differences arising due to contamination from the foreground and background members are accounted for .",
    "although we identified probable cluster members ( t tauri and related sources ) in sec .",
    "3.1 , this identification was based on using only those stars that appear in the @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath5 bands .",
    "however , there are roughly twice as many stars detected in the @xmath5-band , whose cluster membership can not be easily verified .",
    "therefore , we have used statistical criteria to estimate the number of probable member stars in the cluster region . to remove contamination of field stars from the cluster region sample",

    "this indicates that the star formation process is not yet complete in the region .",
    "star formation is ongoing , although previous episodes of star formation activity have resulted in a significantly low mass content .",

    "note that star 2 , which lies in between stars 1 and 3 on the slit , does not show the same recombination lines .",
    "the hi lines are thought to arise very close to the star , since the 120  long slit encompasses the dense nebula and we see no signature of extended nebular emission .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the sed modelling of these bright objects classifies them as massive young stars .",
    "star 1 , the best massive protostellar candidate in the region , shows intense pa@xmath56 emission , in addition to the hi recombination lines . both stars , 1 and 3 , display a rising slope long - ward of 2 @xmath24 m .",
    "together , these features indicate that stars 1 and 3 are early b type stars capable of producing an ionised sphere around themselves @xcite .",
    "main - sequence b stars are characterised by hi absorption features which become weaker for more massive stars . however , for o type stars , helium absorption features appear and become prominent with increasing mass @xcite .",
    "neither hi nor he absorption features are visible in the bright stars 1 and 3 , suggesting that the photospheres are likely obscured by the surrounding compact hii region and dense material .    in contrast , the remaining spectra of fainter stars ( 4 , 5 , 6 & 7 ) are featureless , and display a slope that is either flat or rising short - ward of 2 @xmath24 m .",
    "the absence of any emission features suggests a relatively evolved t tauri star ( antoniucci et al .",
    "2008 ) , while the absence of any absorption features would suggest heavy veiling ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the fainter stars 4 , 5 , 6 & 7 are best matched by t tauri type stars .",
    "the stars 6 & 7 are separated by a projected angle of 1.5 ; both show a common spectral feature at 2.4 @xmath24 m .",
    "this broad feature was not identified with any known spectral lines .",
    "the feature is likely to be a poorly removed telluric absorption feature ( owing to poor sky beyond 2.3 @xmath24 m ) and/or a local artifact in the slit .",
    "we note that there is no such spectral feature known in previous literature , even in the most embedded sources with lots of emission lines .",
    "the four bright stars that dominate the central region of the infrared nebula , namely stars 1 , 3 , 8 and 9 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , are resolved in the _ spitzer _ irac bands for which point source photometry is available .",
    "note that these four stars are the brightest nir sources associated with the iras 19343 + 2026 cluster ( see table 1 ) .",
    "only stars 1 , 3 and 8 were detected in the mips 24 @xmath24 m images .",
    "stars 3 , 8 and 9 are also detected in our optical @xmath44 images .",
    "of these , star 8 is a multiple star with unreliable photometry since the psf is larger than the separation of the multiple components .",
    "therefore , the optical magnitudes of star 8 are used as upper limits in the modelling .",
    "the seds of these four sources were modelled using the online sed fitting tool developed by @xcite .",
    "the results of the sed modelling are summarised in table 2 . in fig .  9 ,",
    "the observed data points ( shown as black dots and filled triangles ) and the fitted sed models are plotted .",
    "the solid black line shows the best fit model while the grey lines represent models that satisfy the criteria of @xmath57 , where @xmath35 is per data point .",
    "the weighted means and standard deviations in table 2 are calculated using all of the parameters from the models that satisfy the above criteria .",
    "the weight is the inverse of the @xmath35 value .",
    "the standard deviations quoted in table 2 help the reader to visualize the spread in the range of values between multiple models that satisfy the above criteria .",
    "the dotted line represents the photospheric emission assumed in the model .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fir peak ( star 1 ) is a young massive star of @xmath2 7.6  which is deeply embedded in an envelope .",
    "the remaining bright stars are 6 - 7  objects with nearly revealed photospheres surrounded by remnant dust envelopes ( indicated by the second peak in the sed models ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that star 1 is not optically visible , unlike stars 3 , 8 and 9 .",
    "the vla nvss survey shows centimeter free - free continuum emission coincident with the central region of this nebula . the cm continuuum emission may represent the ionised gas in the central nebula associated with these four early b type stars"
