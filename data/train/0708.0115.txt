    "the neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath0 ) decay plays a key role in the search for massive majorana neutrinos and their mass scale .",
    "the experimental search for @xmath0 decay has become front - line physics due to the verification of the existence of neutrino mass by the oscillation experiments @xcite and the claimed discovery of the @xmath0 decay @xcite . at present",
    "there are two important experiments taking data , namely the nemo 3 @xcite and cuoricino @xcite experiments .",
    "a host of important future experiments are under r&d planning and construction @xcite .",
    "for all these expensive experiments the computed values of the involved nuclear matrix elements have become an important issue @xcite .",
    "they are essential when one starts to extract quantitative neutrino properties from the measured data .",
    "many nuclear models of different types have been deviced to compute the nuclear matrix elements of the @xmath0 decay @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two complementary families of nuclear models on the market , the nuclear shell model @xcite and the proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( pnqrpa ) @xcite .",
    "the pnqrpa is constructed to describe the energy levels of odd - odd nuclei and their beta decays to the neighboring even - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "also its derivative , renormalized pnqrpa @xcite , has been used @xcite to compute double - beta matrix elements .",
    "the pnqrpa ( and the renormalized pnqrpa ) calculations can be fine tuned by the so - called particle - particle strength parameter , @xmath7 , that controls the magnitude of the proton - neutron two - body interaction for the @xmath8 intermediate states in double beta decay @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to fix the value of this parameter , either by using the data on two - neutrino double beta ( @xmath9 ) decays @xcite or the data on single beta decays @xcite . in this work we use the @xmath9 data to fix the possible values of @xmath7 and cross",
    "check it by single beta decays wherever possible .    in the mass mode of the @xmath0 decay",
    "a light virtual majorana neutrino is exchanged by the two decaying neutrons of the initial nucleus .",
    "the average exchanged momentum is large so that the two neutrons tend to overlap . to prevent this a jastrow type of correlation function",
    "was introduced in @xcite following the parametrization of miller and spencer @xcite .",
    "this method , although microscopically inspired , is just a phenomenological way to introduce _ short - range correlations _ into the two - nucleon relative wave function .",
    "the jastrow function simply cuts off the wave function of the two nucleons at short relative distances @xmath10 leading to a violation of the norm of the wave function .    in the present calculations we improve on the jastrow method by engaging the more sophisticated microscopic approach of unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) @xcite . in the ucom one",
    "obtains the correlated many - particle state from the uncorrelated one by a unitary transformation and thus the norm of the correlated state is conserved and no amplitude is lost in the relative wave function . in the @xmath0 calculations",
    "this leads to a more complete description of the relative wave function for small @xmath10 , as was demonstrated in @xcite for the decays of @xmath11ca and @xmath12ge . in this work and in @xcite , where the decays of @xmath12ge and @xmath13se were analyzed",
    ", it is demonstrated that the jastrow procedure leads to the excessive reduction of 25%  40% in the magnitudes of the @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements . at the same time",
    "the ucom reduces the magnitudes of the matrix elements only by 4%  16% .",
    "the magnitude of the short - range corrections affects the magnitudes of the nuclear matrix elements which , in turn , dictate the neutrino - mass sensitivity of the potentially succesful future double beta experiments .",
    "the notable differences between the jastrow and ucom corrections influence the cost estimates of large - scale experiments if a given neutrino - mass sensitivity is wanted .    in the article",
    "we continue the work of @xcite , where the @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements of @xmath12ge and @xmath13se were derived .",
    "we apply the ucom and jastrow short - range correlations on matrix elements derived by the pnqrpa method and corrected for the _ higher - order terms of nucleonic weak current _ and the _ nucleon s finite size _ using the recipes of @xcite .",
    "we analyze the @xmath0-decay matrix elements of @xmath1zr , @xmath2mo , @xmath3cd , @xmath4te , @xmath5te and @xmath6xe for all the mentioned corrections .",
    "the necessary theoretical background is briefly described in sec .",
    "ii and the numerical application is reviewed in sec .",
    "the results are discussed in sec .",
    "iv , and the summary and conclusions are presented in sec . v.",
    "we start this short review of the theory by presenting the expression for the half - life of the @xmath9 decay : @xmath14 the transition proceeds from the initial ground state , @xmath15 , to the final ground state , @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is an integral over the phase space of the leptonic variables @xcite .",
    "the involved double gamow  teller matrix element , @xmath18 , can be written as @xmath19 where the transition operators are the usual gamow - teller operators for @xmath20 transitions , @xmath21 is the @xmath9 @xmath22 value , @xmath23 is the energy of the @xmath24th intermediate state , @xmath25 is the mass energy of the initial nucleus , and @xmath26 is the rest - mass of the electron .",
    "it has to be noted here that the expression ( [ eq : mdgt ] ) is scaled by the electron rest mass to yield a dimensionless matrix element .",
    "this definition deviates from that of some other authors , like @xcite , where the scaling is not done .",
    "the @xmath0 decay can proceed via the exchange of a light virtual majorana neutrino . assuming this neutrino - mass mechanism to be the dominant one , the inverse of the @xmath0 half - life can be written as @xmath27^{-1 } = g_{1}^{(0\\nu ) } \\left ( \\frac{\\langle m_{\\nu}\\rangle } { m_{\\rm e } } \\right)^{2 } \\left ( m^{(0\\nu)}\\right)^{2}\\ , \\quad m^{(0\\nu ) } = m_{\\rm gt}^{(0\\nu ) } -   \\left ( \\frac{g_{\\rm v}}{g_{\\rm a } } \\right)^{2 } m_{\\rm f}^{(0\\nu ) } + m_{\\rm t}^{(0\\nu ) } .\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath28 is the total nuclear matrix element consisting of the fermi , gamow  teller and tensor contributions .",
    "the effective mass of the neutrino is given by @xmath29 is a component of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the definition of the leptonic phase - space factor @xmath30 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the nuclear matrix elements involved in the mass mode of the @xmath0 decay are defined as @xmath31 where the summation runs over all the intermediate states and the integration is taken over the relative coordinate @xmath32 between the nucleons @xmath33 and @xmath24 .",
    "the neutrino potential @xmath34 , @xmath35 , is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the nuclear radius and @xmath38 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "the term @xmath39 in ( [ eq : nupot ] ) includes the contributions arising from the induced currents and the finite nucleon size @xcite .",
    "next we write the nuclear matrix elements explicitly in the pnqrpa framework .",
    "they are given by @xmath40_j \\vert \\vert j^{\\pi}_{k_{1 } } ) \\langle j^{\\pi}_{k_{1 } } \\vert j^{\\pi}_{k_{2 } } \\rangle ( j^{\\pi}_{k_{2 } } \\vert \\vert   \\left [ c^{\\dag}_{p } \\tilde{c}_{n}\\right]_j \\vert \\vert 0^{+}_{\\rm i } ) \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 label the different pnqrpa solutions for a given multipole @xmath43 .",
    "the operators @xmath44 inside the two - particle matrix element derive from ( [ eq : bbfermi ] ) and ( [ eq : bbgamowt ] ) and they can be written as @xmath45 the expression for the pnqrpa transition densities @xmath46_j \\vert \\vert j^{\\pi}_{k_{1 } } ) $ ] and @xmath47_j \\vert \\vert 0^{+}_{\\rm i})$ ] , and for the overlap factor @xmath48 can be found e.g. in @xcite .    the traditional way to include the short - range correlations in the @xmath0 decay calculations is by introducing the jastrow correlation function @xmath49 , which depends on the relative distance @xmath50 of two nucleons . in the jastrow scheme",
    "the uncorrelated operator @xmath51 is replaced by the correlated operator @xmath52 by a procedure @xmath53 a typical choice for the function @xmath54 in @xmath0 calculations is @xcite @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ". such application of the jastrow correlation function is very rudimentary and , consequently , the jastrow correlation cuts out the @xmath58 part from the relative two - particle wave function . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that this leads to overestimation of the effects of short - range correlations on the many - body wave function .    to circumvent the difficulties associated to the jastrow correlations",
    "the more refined unitary correlation operator method ( ucom ) @xcite was used in the @xmath0 decay calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite . in ucom one obtains the correlated many - body state @xmath59 from the uncorrelated one as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the unitary correlation operator .",
    "the operator @xmath61 is a product of two unitary operators : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 describes short - range tensor correlations and @xmath64 central correlations . due to the unitary of the operator @xmath61",
    "the norm of the correlated state is conserved . moreover , since the correlated matrix element of the operator @xmath51 can be written as @xmath65 it is therefore equivalent to use either correlated states or correlated operators .",
    "for the fermi and gamow - teller @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements the effect of the tensor correlation operator @xmath63 vanishes and one is thus left only with the central correlation operator .",
    "the ucom parameters used in our @xmath0 calculations are the bonn - a parameters taken from @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we applied the pnqrpa to compute the @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements of @xmath12ge and @xmath13se in the model space containing the 1p-0f-2s-1d-0g-0h@xmath66 single - particle orbitals , both for protons and neutrons . here",
    "we add to this model space the spin - orbit partner 0h@xmath67 of the 0h@xmath66 orbital , both for protons and neutrons , to describe the decays of @xmath1zr and @xmath2mo . for the rest of the decays , namely for the @xmath3cd , @xmath4te , @xmath5te and @xmath6xe",
    "decays we have extended the proton and neutron model spaces to include the 1p-0f-2s-1d-0g-2p-1f-0h single - particle orbitals .",
    "the single - particle energies were obtained from a spherical coulomb - corrected woods ",
    "saxon potential with a standard parametrization , optimized for nuclei near the line of beta stability .",
    "slight adjustments were done for some of the energies at the vicinity of the proton and neutron fermi surfaces to reproduce better the low - energy spectra of the neighboring odd-@xmath68 nuclei and those of the intermediate nuclei .    we have used the bonn - a g - matrix as the two - body interaction and we have renormalized it in the standard way @xcite by fitting the pairing parameters of the bcs by comparing with the phenomenological pairing gaps , extracted from the atomic mass tables . the particle - hole parameter @xmath69 of the pnqrpa affects the position of the giant gamow - teller resonance and its value was fixed by the available data on the location of the giant state . due to this phenomenological renormalization of the two - body interaction",
    "we did not perform an additional ucom renormalization @xcite .    after fixing all the hamiltonian parameters the only free parameter left is the proton - neutron particle - particle parameter @xmath7 of the pnqrpa .",
    "we obtained the physical values of @xmath7 by using the method of @xcite .",
    "consequently , we used the extracted experimental matrix elements of @xcite that include the experimental error limits and the uncertainty in the value of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting intervals of the experimental @xmath9 matrix elements are shown in the second column of table  [ tab : intervals ] , and they are scaled by the electron rest mass according to ( [ eq : mdgt ] ) . by performing the pnqrpa calculations of the @xmath9 matrix elements the ranges of experimental matrix elements were subsequently converted to the intervals of @xmath7 values shown in column three of table  [ tab : intervals ]",
    ". for some cases there exists @xmath71 data on @xmath20 decay from the first @xmath8 state of the intermediate nucleus to the ground state of the double beta daughter nucleus . applying the above procedure to this data",
    "leads to the experimental @xmath20 matrix elements and the corresponding ranges of @xmath7 , listed in the last column of table  [ tab : intervals ] .",
    ".[tab : intervals ] values of the @xmath7 parameter extracted from the data .",
    "first column shows the decay and the second column the matrix element values extracted from the @xmath9-decay data by @xcite .",
    "third column gives the range of @xmath7 corresponding to the matrix elements of the second column .",
    "the @xmath7 ranges of the last column were extracted from the available @xmath20 decay data . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results for @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements disagree with those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , just recently @xcite the tbingen - caltec collaboration has corrected their results for a coding error in their computer program .",
    "the results of the erratum @xcite agree nicely with our results for the jastrow corrected nuclear matrix elements .",
    "this means that one can safely say that the jastrow short - range correlations reduce the values of matrix elements some 25%40% . on the other hand , for the ucom",
    "we obtain only a 4%16% reduction . for this reason",
    "our present , ucom corrected matrix elements are larger than the jastrow corrected ones .",
    "such differences give rise to big differences in the predicted @xmath0 half - lives for a given value of the effective neutrino mass @xmath72 .",
    "this invariably affects the sensitivity estimates for the presently running and planned double beta experiments .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0 nuclear matrix elements for the decays of @xmath1zr , @xmath2mo , @xmath3cd , @xmath4te , @xmath5te and @xmath6xe by using the proton - neutron quasiparticle random - phase approximation with realistic two - body interactions in realistic single - particle spaces .",
    "we have corrected the bare matrix elements for higher - order terms of the nucleonic weak currents , for the nucleon s finite - size and for the nucleon - nucleon short - range correlations .",
    "the short - range correlations have been included by using the unitary correlation operator formalism .",
    "this method is superior to the rudimentary jastrow procedure , traditionally adopted for the @xmath0 calculations .",
    "the ucom reduces the magnitudes of the matrix elements less than the jastrow procedure .",
    "this leads to larger matrix elements and shorter @xmath0 half - lives as compared to some recent calculations quoted in the literature .",
    "this has a notable influence on the estimated neutrino - mass sensitivities of the presently running and future double beta experiments .",
