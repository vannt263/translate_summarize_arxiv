    "recent experimental success in producing spin squeezing in atomic samples with collisional nonlinearity @xcite stimulated search for optimum squeezing strategy under the condition of given system nonlinearity .",
    "various proposals of `` shortcuts to adiabaticity '' @xcite and optimized pulse sequences @xcite have been studied . starting with the pioneering work by kitagawa and ueda @xcite ,",
    "two basic squeezing schemes have been identified , the so called one - axis twisting ( oat , hamiltonian @xmath1 ) , and two - axis counter - twisting ( tact , hamiltonian @xmath2 ) .",
    "it has generally been recognized that the tact is more efficient in generating highly squeezed states , although it may be much more challenging to realize experimentally .",
    "therefore , some of the schemes focused at producing effective tact from a @xmath1 hamiltonian by displacing the state back and forth on the poincar sphere by suitable @xmath3 or @xmath4-pulses @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that all hamiltonians quadratic in @xmath5 can be treated in a unified twisting - tensor formalism , and that the maximum squeezing rate is given by the difference of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the twisting tensor @xcite .",
    "thus , although by applying a sequence of rotations one can change the hamiltonian from the oat character to the tact , one does not increase the maximum squeezing rate .",
    "in fact , the emulated tact of @xcite works at most at 2/3 of the maximum rate achieved by the oat at initial stages . here we propose a scheme combining the advantages of these two approaches such that at the beginning the state is squeezed by the maximum possible rate , and later , when the oat becomes less efficient , the process is switched to the effective tact scheme .",
    "although the squeezing rate slows down , ultimately the state can be squeezed much deeper than when using the oat model only .",
    "the system is composed of two bosonic modes described by annihilation operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfying the commutation relation @xmath8 = [ b , b^{\\dag } ] = 1 $ ] . if the processes conserve the total particle number @xmath9 , it is convenient to introduce orbital momentum - like operators @xmath10 defined as @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12=ij_z$ ] , @xmath13=ij_x$ ] , and @xmath14=ij_y$ ] . let the hamiltonian be composed of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 such that in each term the same number of creation and annihilation operators occurs ( total number of particles is conserved ) , and the highest power of each operator is 2 . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 transforms as a vector and @xmath19 transforms as a tensor under o(3 ) rotations ( we call @xmath20 the `` twisting tensor '' @xcite ) . in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , einstein summation rule is applied , and @xmath21 is a linear or quadratic function of the total particle number , generating an unimportant overall phase . as discussed in @xcite , it is convenient to select such a coordinate system in which the twisting tensor is diagonal . since @xmath22 , addition of an arbitrary multiple of unit matrix to @xmath20 can be absorbed in the unimportant term @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , one can always choose it such that the middle eigenvalue of @xmath20 is zero .",
    "there are two special cases of the twisting tensor .",
    "first , the tensor is degenerate with two eigenvalues equal to each other . setting these eigenvalues to zero and denoting the nonzero eigenvalue @xmath20",
    "( it should be clear from the context when @xmath20 denotes the whole tensor and when its components ) , the twisting tensor is @xmath23 corresponding to oat .",
    "the second special case is if the central eigenvalue is exactly in the middle of the two remaining ones .",
    "choosing the central ( zero ) eigenvalue to correspond to the @xmath24-direction , the twisting tensor has the form @xmath25 corresponding to tact .",
    "as shown in @xcite , for nearly gaussian states ( weakly squeezed spin coherent states ) the maximum squeezing rate only depends on the difference between the maximum and the minimum eigenvalues of the twisting tensor , in particular @xmath26 where @xmath27 is defined by @xmath28 here the squeezing parameter is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the smallest eigenvalue of the variance matrix @xmath31 , which for a state centered at the equator of the poincar sphere with @xmath32 is @xmath33 with @xmath34 the squeezing rate of eq .",
    "( [ xiq ] ) depends on the position of the state on the poincar sphere and on the orientation of the squeezing ellipse . the maximum of eq .",
    "( [ qmax ] ) is achieved for states centered at the direction of the main axis corresponding to the middle eigenvalue of @xmath20 , for which orientation of the squeezing ellipse is @xmath35 with respect to the direction of the pole of the maximum eigenvalue ( for details see @xcite ) . if @xmath20 is degenerate ( i.e. , oat case ) with the nonzero eigenvalue in the @xmath24-direction as in eq .",
    "( [ chi1ax ] ) , the fastest squeezing is achieved for states along the equator with @xmath36 , the optimum orientation of the uncertainty ellipse being @xmath35 with respect to the meridian .",
    "thus , to squeeze an initially spin coherent state the fastest way , one has to place it on the equator of the poincar sphere and keep its optimum @xmath35 orientation .",
    "if the state is initially located , e.g. , in the @xmath4 direction , then , as shown in @xcite , the optimum orientation is kept fixed by rotating the state around @xmath4 with the frequency @xmath37 this dynamics corresponds to the early squeezing around an unstable point studied in @xcite with the hamiltonian @xmath38 with @xmath39 . in the limit of @xmath40 the squeezing parameter would decrease exponentially as @xmath41 ( see figs .",
    "[ fcomp1 ] and [ fcomp2 ] , line ` d ' ) .",
    "however , for finite @xmath42 the state starts deviating from gaussian , after some time its shape becomes @xmath43-deformed and the squeezing deteriorates .",
    "the q - function of a strongly deformed state that underwent this process is in fig .",
    "[ fspheres]a and the evolution of @xmath44 is in figs .",
    "[ fcomp1 ] and [ fcomp2 ] , line ` a ' .",
    "note that if we do not rotate the state to keep the optimal orientation , the squeezing parameter decreases slower than exponentially , but eventually can reach deeper values ( see figs .",
    "[ fcomp1 ] and [ fcomp2 ] , line ` b ' ) . for large @xmath45",
    "the state is deformed as the q - function winds around the poincar sphere in a spiral ( see fig .",
    "[ fspheres]b ) .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite a scheme has been proposed to generate an effective tact by switching the position of the state between two locations , one on the equator and the other on the pole of the poincar sphere .",
    "the argument was based on the baker - campbell - hausdorff expansion @xcite , or the trotter - suzuki expansion @xcite of operator exponentials .",
    "the simplest scheme of @xcite works as follows .",
    "the state originally at the equator of the poincar sphere centered at @xmath46 evolves first under the hamiltonian @xmath47 for 2/3 of the cycle period @xmath48 , then a @xmath0 pulse of @xmath3 moves it to the pole where it evolves for 1/3 of the cycle period under @xmath47 , and finally another @xmath0 pulse of @xmath49 brings it back to the original location .",
    "thus , after one cycle the state is changed by the operator @xmath50    the understanding of the schemes is straightforward in terms of the twisting tensor . rather than moving the state",
    ", one can describe the situation in a coordinate system in which the location of the state is fixed and the twisting tensor is switched between two different orientations . in one orientation ,",
    "the main axis with nonzero @xmath20 is in the @xmath51 direction , in the other orientation it is in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the first case lasts for @xmath52 of the period , the second for @xmath53 of the period .",
    "thus , in average the state is subjected to an effective twisting tensor with components @xmath54 along @xmath51 , @xmath55 along @xmath4 , and 0 along @xmath3 .",
    "since the middle eigenvalue is exactly between the two other eigenvalues , the resulting process is two - axis counter - twisting for which the twisting tensor can be written ( after shifting the central eigenvalue to zero ) as @xmath56 since the difference between the largest and smallest eigenvalues is @xmath54 , the maximum squeezing rate is 2/3 of that of the oat scheme . on the other hand , in the tact scheme",
    "the state suffers much less from the shape deformations and the squeezing process can last longer .",
    "thus , ultimately much deeper squeezing can be reached .",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fcomp1 ] and [ fcomp2 ] , line ` c ' . for longer times the state",
    "is also deformed and @xmath44 increases , the q - function being torn apart into two counter - propagating segments ( see fig . [ fspheres]c ) .",
    "the goal is to combine advantages of the two schemes such that at the beginning the state is squeezed fast under the oat and then at time @xmath57 the scheme is switched to the slower tact to reach deeper squeezing values .",
    "the results for two different particle numbers are in figs .",
    "[ fcomp1 ] and [ fcomp2 ] , lines ` a1'`a3 ' . in our examples , for @xmath58 ,",
    "the best achieved squeezing was @xmath59 db . in the emulated tact scheme",
    "it was achieved at @xmath60 , and in the combined scheme with @xmath61 the same amount of squeezing was achieved at @xmath62 . in both cases",
    "the time of one cycle in the tact emulation was @xmath63 .    for @xmath64 ,",
    "the best achieved squeezing in the emulated tact was @xmath65 db at @xmath66 . in the combined scheme with @xmath67",
    "the best achieved squeezing was @xmath68 db at @xmath69 . as can be seen , in the combined scheme deep squeezing",
    "is achieved earlier than in the emulated tact . in our example with @xmath64 the combined scheme also achieved deeper squeezing .",
    "this is caused mostly by the discrete character of the tact emulation : increasing the number of cycles by decreasing @xmath48 leads to even deeper squeezing , the optimum values approaching each other in the two methods .",
    "for example , shortening the cycle time by a factor of 10 , @xmath70 , leads to @xmath71 db squeezing in both methods , in the emulated tact reached at @xmath72 and in the combined scheme with @xmath73 at @xmath74 .",
    "the understanding of the effective tact scheme can be based on time averaging of the twisting tensor .",
    "one can also understand its function as squeezing the state located at the equator for 2/3 of the time , and undoing the @xmath43-shape deformation at the pole for 1/3 of the time .",
    "the oat process generates fourth and higher moments of @xmath5 differing more from the moments of gaussian states than moments generated by the tact process .",
    "these changes are partially compensated when the state is relocated to the pole of the poincar sphere .",
    "the combined scheme proposed here takes the advantage from the fact that at the beginning when the state does not deviate far from the equatorial area the @xmath43-shape deformation is not significant and the state can be squeezed at the maximum possible rate .",
    "choice of the switching time @xmath57 and of the tact - emulation cycle @xmath48 is matter of optimization dependent on the particular physical system . since various sources of losses and decoherence",
    "cause noises increasing with time , it may not be possible to reach the minimum squeezing generated by pure tact . in practical situations one would also have to take into account finite amplitude of the fields generating the @xmath0 pulses and thus finite duration of the tact emulation cycle . as a result",
    ", a reasonable compromise putting more stress to faster squeezing may be required ."
