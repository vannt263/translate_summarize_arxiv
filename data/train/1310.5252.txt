    "roughness noise is the sound produced by rubbing two rough surfaces under light contact pressure  @xcite .",
    "this sound occurs frequently in everyday situations as hand rubbing , stridulatory sound by insects  @xcite or tyre / road contact noise  @xcite . in all these examples ,",
    "the sound is produced by mechanical events occurring in the contact at the scale of asperities .",
    "these events may be mechanical shocks or pinning of asperities followed by a sudden release that produces a local deformation of surfaces near the contact area .",
    "the transient deformations then propagate in the solid and make it vibrate .",
    "the main features of these events are that they are rapid , numerous and unpredictable . in order to understand quantitatively the vibrational and acoustical behaviour of the system",
    ", it is necessary to understand the statistical characteristics of shocks between asperities .",
    "however the calculation of these transient dynamics is not straightforward due to the non - linearity and non - differentiability of the rough contact problem  @xcite . from the experimental point of view , in a series of publications  @xcite , yokoi and nakai showed that the noise level has a strong dependence with both the surface roughness @xmath0 and sliding speed @xmath1 .",

    "this law has been confirmed with various types of materials and setups by othman and elkholy  @xcite or ben abdelounis  @xcite . for a contact between a steel rod and a rotating disc , yokoi and",

    "boyko et al . investigated the effect of surface roughness on the noise spectrum  @xcite .",
    "they found that the rougher the surface , the closer the peak in the spectra to the bending natural frequency of the system .",
    "recently , le bot et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of contact area on friction sound .",
    "they found the existence of two regimes for the relationship of the noise level with contact area depending of the ratio of energy dissipated within the contact and that dissipated by the whole vibrating system . in the first regime ,",
    "the noise level is constant _",
    "i.e. _ does not depend on the contact area , while in the second one , it is proportional to the contact area .",
    "a simple reasoning based on energy balance showed that a part of the vibrational energy is dissipated into the contact itself with a rate of dissipation @xmath7 proportional to the product of the local vibrational energy @xmath8 and the contact area @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical simulation of the dynamics of two frictional surfaces has been widely investigated thanks to the rapid progress of computer technology  @xcite .",
    "in particular , many models have been developed to study the different types of friction noise . in ref",
    "@xcite , andersson and kropp used the non - linear penalty method to compute the contacts and the green s theory for the dynamic response of tyres in order to handle the tyre / road noise problem . in ref  @xcite ,",
    "the brake noise is simulated using a finite element model and the forward increment lagrange multiplier method . in ref",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the relationship between the vibration level @xmath10 as a function of the surface roughness and the sliding speed can be predicted by a 2d finite element model .",
    "however , due to the micrometer size of asperities , it requires a very large number of mesh elements and this method is currently not feasible for 3d models of rough contact .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative method based on the modal decomposition to study the laws of roughness noise .",
    "the modal decomposition is an efficient method to analyze structure dynamics .",
    "the equation of motion is developed in terms of new variables called the modal coordinates which are the solutions of a set of modal equations  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the original equation is obtained via a superposition of modes .",
    "the reduction is achieved by a truncation on the mode number which has been used in the computation  @xcite .",
    "this approach not only allows to predict the evolution of the vibration level versus @xmath0 and @xmath1 but also gives more quantitative and qualitative informations related to the mechanical events at the micro - asperity scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the numerical approach which consists in the mathematical formulation , a time integration scheme and two algorithms for the contact . in section 3 ,",
    "two validation tests are presented .",
    "the first one is a comparison with an analytical solution and the second one with the finite element method . in section 4",
    ", a realistic problem is studied with an emphasis on the statistics of local events .",
    "eventually , a conclusion is presented in section 5 .",
    "the simulation is based on a 2d model which is made up of two beams in contact as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : model ] .    .",
    "at time @xmath11 , the horizontal offset is imposed @xmath12 . ]    the top beam moves horizontally with a constant velocity @xmath1 while the bottom beam is fixed at both ends .",
    "the beams have nominally flat rough surfaces described by their profiles . the initial vertical gap _",
    "i.e. _ the separation between the two reference lines of the profiles is @xmath13 . during the movement asperities of the top profile",
    "can hit asperities of the bottom profile .",
    "since a profile can not penetrate the antagonist profile , repulsive forces take place at contact points and lead to a global deformation @xmath14 of the profiles .",
    "contacts are transient with a short duration and they result in a vibration of the whole beams .",
    "the vibrating beams then radiate sound in the surrounding air although this dissipative process is not taken into account in the present model .",
    "we make the following assumptions :    * the vertical deflection @xmath14 of the neutral axis follows the euler - bernoulli theory of beams ( small flexural vibration , rotational inertia neglected ) . *",
    "the beams are infinitely rigid in the horizontal direction and therefore the horizontal position of profile nodes is imposed ( no longitudinal vibration ) .",
    "* profiles can not penetrate each other ( signorini s condition ) . *",
    "the persistence of contact is ensured by a vertical gravity force .    in this model , the beams thicknesses",
    "are intended to be the actual thicknesses of the two solids under consideration .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the effective thicknesses of the rough layers are much smaller than the thicknesses of the bulk of the beams .",
    "the validity of euler - bernoulli s theory is well - known : the wavelength of flexural vibrations must be large compared to the thickness .",
    "this condition imposes a high frequency limit of the order of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the sound speed in the material and @xmath17 the thickness . beyond this limit",
    ", higher order theories such as timoshenko s beam must be considered .",
    "the second major assumption of this model is that longitudinal vibration has been neglected .",
    "the main reason is that in - plane motion does not contribute to the sound radiation process ( only out - of - plane motion is coupled with the surrounding fluid ) .",
    "furthermore , the longitudinal vibration is generally much smaller than flexural vibration . assuming that modal energies are equal ( thermal equilibrium ) , the ratio of longitudinal energy to flexural energy is of order of @xmath18 .",
    "longitudinal vibration is therefore negligible ( ratio smaller than 0.1 ) up to a frequency of order @xmath19 .",
    "we emphasize the fact that , in our model , friction is neglected .",
    "the first possible contribution of friction is to add a horizontal component to the contact forces .",
    "of course , this force would influence the horizontal vibration but , as we have just argued that the latter have a negligible contribution to the emitted sound , one may admit that friction does not contribute to sound radiation at first order .",
    "the second possible contribution arises from the fact that local contacts are not horizontal .",
    "thus , the vertical projection of the friction force should in principle be taken into account to calculate the flexural vibration .",
    "however , this component is of order of @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normal contact force , @xmath22 the friction coefficient and @xmath23 the mean slope of asperities . in most practical situations ,",
    "@xmath22 is about 0.1 and @xmath23 is smaller than about 0.1 , so this component is much smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "each profile is described in static condition by a function @xmath24 giving the vertical position of nodes versus abscissa .",
    "but since the top profile is moving , we introduce two frames respectively attached to the bottom and top profiles .",
    "the frame @xmath25 is fixed , the @xmath26-axis is oriented to the right and the @xmath27-axis is oriented upward ( fig .",
    "[ fi : model ] ) . the bottom profile @xmath28 is given in this frame . the frame @xmath29 is shifted vertically by @xmath13 and is moving horizontally rightward at speed @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath30-axis is oriented rightward and the @xmath31-axis is oriented downward .",
    "the top profile @xmath32 is given in this frame .",
    "assuming that the origins @xmath33 and @xmath34 match at @xmath35 , the transformation relationships are @xmath36 and @xmath37 . due to the presence of vibration , a vertical deflection @xmath38",
    "must be superimposed to the static position @xmath39 of nodes . at time @xmath11 , the coordinates of a bottom node are therefore @xmath26 and @xmath40 in the fixed frame .",
    "similarly , the coordinates of a top node are @xmath30 and @xmath41 in the moving frame . the apparent contact zone at time @xmath11 is @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the length of the bottom and top beams , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the contact force per unit width ( unit : n / m ) is specified by a field @xmath46 in the fixed frame and @xmath47 in the moving frame . by the third newton law , @xmath48 in the apparent contact zone .",
    "the governing equations for the transverse motion of profiles are : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the beam index ( bottom beam @xmath51 , top beam @xmath52 ) , @xmath53 the bending stiffness , @xmath54 the young s modulus , @xmath55 the moment of inertia , @xmath56 a viscous damping coefficient and @xmath57 the mass per unit length .",
    "the gravity force per unit width is @xmath58 for the bottom beam but @xmath59 for the top beam since the moving frame is oriented downward . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : governing ] ) , @xmath60 has unit n / m and is therefore a contact force per unit width of the beams ( in the direction perpendicular to the plane @xmath61 ) . for simplicity , @xmath60 will hereafter be denoted as  contact force ",

    "the third equation is the complementary condition : either the contact force is zero ( non contact ) or the gap is zero ( contact ) but in all cases the product @xmath68 is zero .",
    "these conditions are also known as kuhn - tucker s conditions in the field of optimization .      in this sub - section ,",
    "the mathematical problem  ( [ eq : governing])-([eq : signorini ] ) is formulated in modal coordinates in consequence of which spatial coordinates will be removed .",

    "the motion of the system is governed by a partial differential equation in which two profiles are locally coupled by a contact force at some of the highest asperities .",

    "the direct numerical simulation of a realistic problem have been presented at two length scales .",
    "first , the asperity - scale shocks can be determined from the time evolution of contact forces .",
    "it allows the characterisation of the probability distributions of the properties of shocks ( duration , force , transferred energy ) .",
    "second , the macroscale vibration level @xmath10 of the resonator can be obtained as the space and time average of the vibrational velocity of nodes in the simulation .",
    "the vibration level is found to be a linearly increasing function of the logarithm of both the surface roughness and sliding speed , in good agreement with experimental results from the literature .",
    "our method can thus predict the evolution of the vibration level at macro scale by assessing the characteristics of shock between asperities at the micro scale .",
    "furthermore , we can easily modify the input parameters in order to extend the results to other materials or dimension of solids .",
    "this numerical approach could be used for more complex systems such as wheel / rail or tyre / road .",
    "a significant advantage of our method is its potential for drastic cpu time reduction .",
    "for instance , solving a realistic problem with a space step of 5 @xmath22 m and a time step of 0.01 @xmath22s takes only a few hours of cpu time for a 2d simulation .",
    "this is to be compared with several days of cpu time using the finite element method .",
    "this is directly due to the modal truncation that we used .",
    "the number of kept modes is to be chosen according to the application considered .",
    "here we have limited the simulation to the audio range because we focused on the friction noise . however ,",
    "if small scale phenomena are investigated , higher frequency modes will be required in order to account for the local deformation of asperities .",
    "this will subsequently require a smaller time step to ensure stability of the numerical results , and thus a much longer cpu time . as a conclusion",
