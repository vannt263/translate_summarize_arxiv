    "while it is widely agreed upon that galaxy - galaxy interactions and , in particular , mergers play a crucial role for the growth of supermassive black holes in quasars and also for providing the fuel for quasar activity , there is still dispute whether these black holes are of primordial nature or not .",
    "n - body simulations ( e.g. by @xcite ) show that the tidal forces in interacting galaxies can trigger strong gas inflows towards the center of the merger .",
    "the mass of this gas is sufficient to build a supermassive bh of @xmath0 and provide enough fuel for quasar activity . on the basis of the @xmath1-viscosity model by @xcite calculations by @xcite show that it takes less than @xmath2a from the merger to form a fully developed quasar even if no primordial supermassive bh was originally present .",
    "this model can be tested by comparing the resulting co - moving space density of quasars to those derived from observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "based on results by @xcite we assume an average time delay of @xmath3a between the merger and the peak quasar activity .",
    "the individual values of this delay depend , of course , on details like the size ( @xmath4 ) and initial mass ( @xmath5 ) of the disk .",
    "estimates of the relevant ( viscous ) timescale show its dependence @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to the  at first glance surprising  finding of the faster formation of the more massive black holes . for our present purpose",
    ", however , an average value of this delay serves its purpose . for more details of this model ,",
    "we refer the reader to the contribution by duschl and strittmatter in this volume and in @xcite .    for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to use a  test universe \" comprised of 50 000 galaxies .",
    "this test universe is expanding according to an einstein - de sitter - cosmology with a hubble constant of @xmath7 .",
    "our galaxies are treated as particles with a finite cross section and a thermal velocity dispersion of @xmath8 . in this framework",
    "we compute the merger rate for each simulated time bin ( @xmath9a ) by taking into account two different processes : direct geometrical hits and gravitationally driven mergers .",
    "for the first process we assume every galaxy to have a spherical cross section with a radius of 15 kpc .",
    "for the second process the cross section radius is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the mass of one galaxy and @xmath12 being the relative velocity between both .",
    "we assume a delay between the merger and the onset of the quasar phase of @xmath13a for the geometrical hit and @xmath14a for the gravitationally driven merger .",
    "the quasar phase in turn is assumed to last for another @xmath15a .    in our model",
    "the universe is treated in very simple manner : as an expanding spherical box .",
    "the size of this box is determined by deriving today s matter density from the assumed hubble constant ( @xmath16 ) and then using the friedmann - lematre - equation to calculate the according radius at any given time .",
    "we completely neglect structure formation and start our simulation with large galaxies ( @xmath17 ) already in place @xmath18a after the big bang . to account for the formation of galaxies we increase their number over the first @xmath13a of our simulation until the final number of 50 000 is reached ( see fig .",
    "[ horst02simul ] for the effect of this procedure ) .",
    "a. in panel b ) a constant galaxy formation rate and in panel c ) a gaussian formation rate were used ",
    "the resulting co - moving space density of quasars is almost exactly the same . ]",
    "the comparison between our model results and observational data compiled by @xcite is shown in fig.[horst02obs ] .",
    "the quasar density evolution at lower redshifts and the position of the peak at @xmath19 match very well .",
    "please note that the x - ray selected sample contains lower luminosity agn in addition to quasars . in this respect",
    "it is natural that our results resemble the 2df curve ( from @xcite ) better than the data from @xcite . at higher redshifts the deviation between simulated and observed co - moving spatial density is increasing . in our model",
    "we clearly miss the earliest quasars which arise from exceptionally fast evolving mergers . despite this shortcoming of our results",
    "their overall agreement with observational data is remarkable ."
