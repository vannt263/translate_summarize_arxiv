    "a purely one - dimensional metal is not expected to retain the fermi liquid properties of its three - dimensional counterpart , which is characterized by a one - to - one relationship of its excitations to those of a non - interacting fermi system and an electron quasiparticle lifetime that diverges to infinity near the fermi surface . instead",
    ", any interaction between electrons in a one - dimensional metal is expected to lead to a non - zero scattering phase - shift and to destroy completely the quasi - electron nature of the excitations @xcite .",
    "the resulting `` luttinger liquid '' state has separate charge and spin excitations , and quite different transport properties from those of a fermi liquid .",
    "the luttinger liquid state is an adiabatic continuation of the ground state of a simple one - dimensional model , the luttinger model @xcite , in much the same way that a fermi - liquid state can be adiabatically derived from the ground state of noninteracting fermions .",
    "how could we observe this fascinating state of matter ?",
    "we can not fabricate purely one - dimensional systems in the laboratory , but we can produce systems that are quasi - one - dimensional , to a greater or a lesser degree . in several of these , searches for luttinger liquid behaviour have been undertaken .",
    "these include charge - transfer salts such as tmtsf having almost one - dimensional bandstructures @xcite , semiconductor quantum wires @xcite , edge states in the quantum hall effect ( which are chiral systems along which electrons can only propagate in one direction ) @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , and atomic - scale quantum wires fabricated by self - assembly @xcite or novel spm - based surface lithographies @xcite .",
    "the important question for a theorist is whether such a quasi - one - dimensional system , interacting with a three - dimensional environment , would be expected to show luttinger liquid behaviour or not , and if so , for what range of parameters .",
    "this question was given particular timeliness by the recent angle - resolved photoemission results of segovia @xcite , which have shown that photoemission from chains of au atoms on si@xmath0 exhibits features which may be signatures of the spin and charge collective modes indicative of luttinger liquid behaviour .",
    "in this paper we begin to construct a theoretical framework within which we can answer these questions .",
    "we consider the simplest possible model of such a system  one in which the atomic wire is represented by a single - chain spinless luttinger model , with electron - electron interactions , on a lattice . the environment is represented only by a chain with no interactions but which is otherwise identical .",
    "electrons can hop between the two chains by hybridization of the electron states .",
    "such a simple system does not capture the full complexities of electron scattering with the environment , nor can it represent the magnetic behaviour of a luttinger liquid .",
    "however it provides a relatively simple starting point , and can already be used to calculate one - particle spectral functions such as those probed by photoemission experiments .    in the following sections we explain the details of our model and our numerical methods in section  [ sec : theoretical_methods ] , and then describe our results in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we find that some aspects of the model display luttinger liquid - like behaviour while others do not ; we then summarize these different properties in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we base our numerical calculations on haldane s luttinger model operator method @xcite for a chain of spinless idealized atoms with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the luttinger model is characterized by a linearized dispersion relation with slope @xmath1 and a complete separation of the populations of left- and right - moving particles ( as in figure [ fig : luttinger_model ] ) plus the inclusion of an infinity of negative energy electrons @xcite .",

    "in addition there are two further parameters related to @xmath32 : for a spinless luttinger liquid they are given by @xmath35 , \\label{eq : alpha}\\\\      \\gamma = 2\\alpha .",

    "it is necessary to introduce a further phase factor into its definition , analogous to haldane s phase factor @xmath55 for ensuring anticommutation between the branches of a single chain .",
    "the total ladder operator component of equation ( [ eq : fermion_boson ] ) thus takes the form @xmath56 where the subscript @xmath57 is a chain index .",

    "our model is completed by setting the interaction strength on chain b to zero but retaining interactions on chain a. with the non - interacting chain representing the surface and the interacting chain the wire , we therefore form our highly simplified model of an atomic wire interacting with a substrate .",
    "the size of the computational hilbert space is restricted by allowing only one boson in each mode .",
    "while this successfully truncates the hilbert space to a manageable size it does not affect the low energy properties in which we are interested , as we have checked that only higher energy excitations involve basis states with more than one boson in each mode .",
    "we also neglect the presence of the infinity of negative energy electrons , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "however , we are still strongly limited in the size of the system we can handle : the hilbert space scales exponentially with both length of chains and number of electrons .",
    "the largest system for which we have been able to calculate with arbitrary numbers of electrons is one with length @xmath67 ( i.e. 12 sites in total ) . in order to obtain both the eigenstates of the coupled system and its correlation functions we utilize the lanczos method @xcite .      we define the spectral function @xmath68 as @xmath69,\\ ] ] with @xmath70 , and the retarded green s function @xmath71 defined as the double fourier transform of @xmath72 where the subscripts @xmath6 and @xmath51 again indicate branch and chain indices .",

    "whereas for a fermi liquid we would expect @xmath73 to be a delta function at the fermi energy , the situation for a luttinger liquid is quite different .",
    "spectral weight is repelled from the fermi surface owing to the virtual particle - hole excitations generated by the inter - branch scattering term @xmath74 , resulting in a broadened peak . as @xmath5",
    "is increased the fermi liquid spectral function will merely broaden like @xmath75 reflecting the finite lifetime of electrons away from @xmath76 , but for a luttinger liquid there is zero spectral weight within a range @xmath77 of the fermi energy .",
    "in addition , the negative frequency contribution is suppressed exponentially with @xmath5 , and for a continuum luttinger liquid the positive frequency contributions have a power law dependence . for @xmath78 this is of the form @xmath79 and for @xmath80 it is of the form @xmath81 , with @xmath82 given by equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) @xcite .",

    "the ground and neutral first excited states are calculated for different values of the interaction strength @xmath64 as detailed above .",
    "as we have chosen the basis states for the system to be those before the bogoliubov transformation , we find that the non - interacting ground state ( i.e. @xmath92 ) consists entirely of zero - boson basis states , whereas all the interacting systems ( @xmath93 ) have contributions from basis states that include bosons on one or both chains , as these basis states are not individually eigenstates of the interacting system .",

    "we see that the ground state energy has a region of roughly linear dependence on @xmath64 in the range @xmath99 and thereafter is rather less dependent on @xmath64 . the first excited state , however , is linear in @xmath64 for @xmath100 , at which point it becomes completely independent of @xmath64 .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath101 for the non - interacting system is equal to @xmath102 , indicating that for this size of system the first excitation is one between the bonding and anti - bonding bands with zero net momentum change .",
    "as we increase @xmath64 however , the bonding and antibonding bands distort to such an extent that eventually , at @xmath103 , the lowest excitation becomes not one between bands with zero net momentum , but an intra - band one with net momentum change @xmath104 . for a luttinger liquid",
    ", we would expect the velocity @xmath105 in this expression to be the luttinger velocity @xmath106 ( as in equations ( [ eq : velocities_1 ] ) , etc . ) rather than the fermi velocity @xmath1 , leading to a continued @xmath64-dependence for @xmath101 .",
    "however , it is clear from figure [ fig : energy_scaling ] that this is not the case for this system : the excitation energy for @xmath107 remains constant and equal to @xmath108 .",
    "( for this system @xmath109 . )",
    "this can be explained as follows  as @xmath64 is increased the single - chain energy levels on chain a increase ( since the interaction is repulsive ) , while those on the non - interacting chain b remain constant .",
    "it therefore becomes energetically preferable for the electrons to move to the non - interacting chain b rather than remain on the ( interacting ) chain a , until the point is reached at which the system is predominantly populated by electrons on chain b. this chain is still fermi liquid - like , thus shifting the properties of the system as a whole back from partially luttinger liquid - like to fermi liquid - like .",
    ", @xmath94 , @xmath95 system from electrons on each chain as a function of interaction strength @xmath64 .",
    "see text for a full explanation.,width=415 ]    this is confirmed by an examination of the location of the electrons for both the ground and first excited states .",
    "figure [ fig : charge_distribution ] shows a plot for @xmath110 , showing the chain to which the electrons `` belong '' , again based on an analysis of the contribution of each of the basis states forming the eigenstate . as we have only 2 electrons in this system , there are three possible distributions for the electrons : both on chain a ( `` a - like '' ) , both on chain b ( `` b - like '' ) or one on each chain ( `` equal '' ) .    first consider the ground states .",
    "we see that for the non - interacting ground state the electrons are distributed equally between the chains , and once interactions are switched on we evolve continuously towards a regime where basis states with electrons on chain a are strongly suppressed in favour of states with both electrons on chain b.    the situation for the excited states is however quite different .",
    "we start at @xmath92 with a state in which , like the ground state , the electrons are equally distributed between the chains .",
    "this state is , however , 4-fold degenerate and immediately even weak interactions are introduced , this degeneracy is lifted and , in what is now the lowest state , the contribution from basis states with both electrons on the same chain are strongly suppressed .",
    "the first excited state for small values of @xmath64 may therefore be thought of as `` covalent '' in nature , as opposed to the `` ionic''-like states that contribute to the non - interacting state where both electrons are on the same chain .",
    "as interactions are increased further , the contribution from the ionic - like states begins to return .",
    "however , once we hit the point ( at @xmath111 ) where the nature of the excitations changes from zero net momentum change to @xmath112 , there is once more a discontinuity in the plot and the electron contributions from this point match those of the ground state , indicating that there is no net interchain electron hopping involved in these excitations .",
    "results from the calculation of the spectral function @xmath113 are presented in figure [ fig : spectral_function_q=0 ] .",
    "there are three sources of the broadening of the peaks away from the delta function one would expect from a fermi liquid .",
    "the first of these is due to the finite value of the imaginary energy @xmath85 we have used in our calculations , leading to broadening of the peaks into lorentzians with width @xmath114 .",
    "the second results from the splitting into bonding and anti - bonding bands due to the inter - chain coupling and is equal to @xmath102 .",
    "the remaining broadening , however , is due to the removal of spectral weight from the fermi energy at @xmath115 , and is indicative of luttinger liquid behaviour in the coupled system .    .",

    "in order to show the splitting clearly , the electron and hole contributions are shown as equal in magnitude.,width=415 ]    we can also calculate @xmath117 although for our extremely small system , we are severely restricted in available values of @xmath5 . as we would expect for a luttinger liquid",
    ", there is a strong suppression of the hole contribution for @xmath118 .",
    "owing to the discrete nature of this system , it is not possible to calculate the luttinger parameter @xmath32 direct from the slopes of the electron and hole contributions as in references @xcite .",
    "however , we can still derive a value for @xmath32 from the separation of the electron and hole peaks as follows : for a non - interacting coupled chain system , the electron and hole contributions to @xmath119 are separated by @xmath102 , whereas for a single luttinger liquid the contributions to @xmath117 are separated by @xmath120 .",
    "we define an effective @xmath106 in terms of the peak splitting @xmath121 by the relation @xmath122 then , since we have @xmath123 , we can use @xmath124 as a measure of @xmath106 and equate equations ( [ eq : velocities_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : velocities_2 ] ) to give an expression for the luttinger parameter : @xmath125 \\\\     & = v_0^{\\rm eff},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath91 .",

    "our calculations approach the question of whether our model exhibits luttinger liquid behaviour from several complementary directions .",
    "we have presented results for the nature of the ground state , for the nature of excited states ( charged and neutral ) and the related response functions governing the response of the system to excitation .",
    "we have also estimated the exponents in certain power - laws characterizing the luttinger liquid state .",
    "our results display a certain ambiguity with regard to whether or not this system is a luttinger liquid .",
    "roughly speaking , the evidence from the bosonic nature of the ground state , the charged excited states , and the values of the scaling parameters is all broadly consistent with luttinger liquid behaviour , modified by the presence of the second chain .",
    "specifically , the one - particle spectral function is consistent with luttinger liquid behaviour . at @xmath129 , the total spectral function",
    "is broadened by separation of the electron and hole parts  this separation is much greater than the @xmath102 expected in a non - interacting two - chain system . for @xmath130 , there is additional separation of the electron and hole parts , consistent with the further suppression of spectral weight near the fermi energy .",
    "( for @xmath118 , corresponding to probing the occupancy of states with @xmath131  see equation  ( [ eq : spectral_function ] )  the hole part of the spectral function is strongly suppressed , even for relatively strong interactions . )",
    "further support for the luttinger liquid hypothesis comes from the composition of that portion of the ground state in which bosons are excited on chain a : this fraction closely tracks the fraction that would be expected in an isolated single - chain luttinger liquid ( figure  [ fig : bosoncontributions ] ) .",
    "moreover , we are able to derive indirectly from @xmath132 values for two luttinger liquid parameters : @xmath32 ( which determines the ratio of the different velocities ) and @xmath38 ( which determines the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation functions ) . although our analysis presupposes the validity of relations characterizing the luttinger liquid state ( equation ( [ eq : k_rho_results ] ) ) , the results are self - consistent in the sense that they show @xmath133 and @xmath134 , i.e. , departures from the fermi - liquid values .",
    "the degree of departure from fermi - liquid values is , however , somewhat less than would be expected for a single - chain system with the same interaction strength ( see figure  [ fig : luttinger_parameter_results ] ) .",
    "however , we also have evidence that there is some residual fermi liquid behaviour .",
    "this comes principally from the distribution of charge across the two chains , as a function of interaction strength , in the ground and neutral excited states .",
    "transfer of charge to the non - interacting chain at higher values of @xmath64 results in the resurrection of a fermi - liquid like neutral excitation spectrum ( although we are still able to extract non - fermi liquid values for the luttinger parameters for these interaction strengths , as explained above ) .",
    "this implies that while the neutral excitation spectrum undergoes a transformation to fermi liquid behaviour at large @xmath64 , the charged excitation spectrum does not .",
    "it remains to be seen how the apparent conflict between these different views on the same underlying quantum state is resolved .",
    "finally , it should be noted that in our system the surface is represented as metallic , although in order to achieve true one - dimensional conduction in an experiment it is much more likely that a semiconducting or insulating substrate would be employed , as in the work of @xcite .",
    "one might expect that with a gapped substrate , the elimination of hybridization with substrate states at the fermi energy would promote luttinger liquid formation by comparison with the metallic case .",
    "so our finding that some aspects of luttinger liquid spectral behaviour persist even in the metallic case may also have implications for recent and future experiments .",
    "we plan further theoretical work on semiconducting substrates",
    ". it would also be interesting to study the influence of wire - substrate interactions other than simple hybridization on luttinger liquid formation ."
