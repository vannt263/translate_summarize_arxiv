    "the van der waals and casimir interactions , which are known under the generic name of dispersion forces,@xcite are caused by the vacuum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . at shortest separations of a few nanometers dispersion forces are usually referred to as the _ van der waals _ forces . at larger separations , when the relativistic retardation becomes important , it is customary to speak about the _",
    "casimir _ forces . in the last few years",
    "the fluctuation induced forces attracted much attention in the literature@xcite due to their prospective applications in both fundamental physics and nanotechnology .",
    "specifically , a lot of experiments has been performed@xcite on measuring dispersion forces between metallic , dielectric and semiconductor surfaces spaced at separations from a few tens to a few hundreds nanometers .",
    "recently , special attention has been directed to carbon nanostructures , such as one - atom - thick graphene sheets , carbon nanotubes , fullerenes etc . which possess unique mechanical , electrical and optical properties.@xcite",
    "these properties appear to be particularly promising to provide the basis for future carbon - based nanoelectronics . keeping in mind that elements of nano- and microelectromechanical devices are separated by distances of the order of tens or hundreds nanometers , the dispersion forces acting between them are gaining in importance .",
    "for this reason , a lot of papers has been devoted to calculations of the van der waals and casimir forces between two carbon nanostructures and between a carbon nanostructure and a regular material body.@xcite particular attention has been given also the the casimir - polder interaction of different atoms and molecules with carbon nanostructures.@xcite    the many and varied formalisms were applied to calculate the van der waals and casimir forces between two graphene sheets .",
    "here we center our attention on the approaches consistent with the most realistic _ dirac _ model which assumes the linear dispersion relation of the graphene bands at low energy@xcite ( there is also the so - called _ hydrodynamic _ model of graphene@xcite which does not take this property into account ) .",
    "specifically , we compare the computational results obtained using the density fluctuation approach and the random phase approximation,@xcite and using the conductivity of graphene modeled as a combination of lorentz - type oscillators without account@xcite and with account@xcite of spatial dispersion .",
    "it should be emphasized that the most straightforward formalism for calculation of the van der waals and casimir forces between graphene and different substances within the dirac model is based on the lifshitz theory and exploits the reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic oscillations on graphene expressed in terms of the polarization tensor in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time.@xcite using this formalism , the van der waals and casimir interactions between a graphene sheet and an ideal metal plane,@xcite and between a graphene sheet and different atoms@xcite and plates made of various real materials@xcite were computed .",
    "the case of graphene - graphene interaction remained , however , unexplored within this calculation approach .",
    "the present paper is devoted to calculation of the graphene - graphene thermal van der waals and casimir interactions using the lifshitz theory and the dirac model for electronic properties of graphene .",
    "the reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic oscillations on graphene are expressed directly through the polarization tensor without recourse to the concept of dielectric permittivity .",
    "all calculations are performed for both gapless pristine graphene and graphene sheets characterized by some nonzero mass gap parameter .",
    "note that the dirac - type excitations in graphene become massive under the influence of electron - electron interaction , substrates , defects of structure and some other effects.@xcite we calculate both the van der waals and casimir free energy per unit area and pressure as functions of separation between the graphene sheets and the van der waals and casimir pressure as a function of temperature . for a gapless graphene our results are in agreement with computations using coulomb coupling between density fluctuations with subsequent thermal average.@xcite the latter approach",
    "is in fact equivalent@xcite to the nonretarded limit of the lifshitz formula with the polarization of an isolated graphene sheet described in the random phase approximation .",
    "it was also shown,@xcite that retardation effects are of only minor importance for graphene .",
    "for graphene sheets with nonzero mass gap parameter we obtain a qualitatively different behavior for the free energy and pressure , as compared to the pristine graphene . in this case",
    "the character of force depends on the relationship between the mass gap parameter and the temperature .",
    "we provide a discussion concerning the comparison of our results with other results obtained in the literature for graphene - graphene van der waals and casimir interactions using the dirac model.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we begin with the lifshitz formula containing the reflection coefficients derived using the dirac model .",
