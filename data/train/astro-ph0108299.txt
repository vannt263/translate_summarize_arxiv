    "to determine the instrumental magnitudes of most of these various sne , we use the technique of template subtraction described in richmond et al .",
    "( 1995 ; see also filippenko et al .",
    "1986 ) to minimize the light contamination by the background galaxy .",
    "this involves taking a `` template '' image of the galaxy long after the supernova has faded .",
    "the template image was matched to each early - time image by registering the template using several field stars in common .",
    "the template was obtained under superior seeing conditions and was then convolved with a gaussian to match the widths of the point - spread function ( psf ) of each early - time image .",
    "the magnitudes of the field stars for both the template and early - time images were measured using a circular aperture of 15 pixels radius and a sky annulus of width 10 pixels .",
    "comparing the magnitudes , an average scale factor was obtained and used to subtract the template image from the early - time image . the flux scale factor varied by @xmath36 10% typically from star to star within a given frame .",
    "the resulting template - subtracted image showed only the sn and , occasionally , the small residuals of the field stars and the host galaxy nucleus . the sn magnitude was then measured with negligible contamination from the galaxy light .    for sne  1993ae , 1994 m , and 1995d ,",
    "template subtraction was not needed , because the sn was sufficiently far from the galactic nucleus and in a region of relatively uniform background .",
    "simple aperture photometry was performed in these cases , with a circular aperture of 10 or 15 pixels radius and a 10-pixel - width sky annulus .",
    "psf - fitting photometry , via iraf / daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , was performed for sn  1994y and for the leuschner observations of sn  1993y . in both cases ,",
    "the model psf was constructed using bright , isolated field stars on each of the images .",
    "sn  1993y was far enough from the host galaxy nucleus that the background was negligible in all bands .",
    "on particular nights when the conditions were photometric , standard star fields from landolt ( 1992 ) were observed in @xmath24 , along with images of the sn .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of these stars were determined using either a 10- or 15-pixel - radius circular aperture and a 10-pixel - width sky annulus . using iraf , the photometric instrumental magnitudes were converted to apparent magnitudes with the transformation equations @xmath37 where @xmath38 are instrumental magnitudes , @xmath24 are standard apparent magnitudes , and @xmath39 are the airmass values .",
    "the second - order extinction terms were set to zero .",
    "the results , along with the number of landolt fields observed and used on each night to determine the photometric solution , are shown in table  1 . in solving these equations",
    ", the standard deviations in the residuals were on the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "thus , the net uncertainty of the fit can be taken to be @xmath40 mag .    in each of figures 110 ,",
    "the labeled field stars were the comparisons used to determine the apparent magnitude of the respective sn .",
    "each field star s instrumental magnitude was measured , again using the same aperture and sky annulus as above , and transformed with equations ( 1)(4 ) into apparent magnitudes .",
    "table 2 lists the results and their respective uncertainties .",
    "the images were fairly clean , so that cosmic ray hits near the stars of interest occurred only rarely .",
    "in such cases where the cosmic - ray pixels could be easily identified , they were smoothed by linear interpolation using nearby pixels . in cases when there were no photometric observations made , the apparent magnitudes of the field stars were obtained from riess ( 1996 ) . also , observations of sne  1993z , 1994ae , 1995d , and 1994y occurred on multiple nights under photometric conditions ; the night with the smallest photometric uncertainties was adopted as the standard .",
    "comparisons of our field star calibrations with riess ( 1996 ) and riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) were made , whenever possible , and the results were generally quite consistent .",
    "each sn instrumental magnitude was then converted into an apparent magnitude on the standard johnson - kron - cousins @xmath24 system using a weighted mean of the difference between the instrumental and apparent magnitudes of the field stars .",
    "tables  36 present these magnitudes along with their uncertainties .",
    "in addition , a comparison of the sn  1994y data using psf fitting versus template - subtraction yielded negligible differences when the sn was bright .",
    "comparisons with the results of riess ( 1996 ) and riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) generally show good agreement for the objects and epochs in common : the mean difference for 34 points is @xmath41 0.01 mag , and the dispersion is @xmath41 0.07 mag",
    ". however , there may be a slight systematic trend , namely our average values are @xmath41 0.04 , 0.02 , 0.01 mag brighter in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively , and @xmath41 0.03 mag fainter in @xmath45 than those of riess ( 1996 ) and riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the transformation equations ( [ eq : b])-([eq : i ] ) , which were used on photometric nights at lick to derive apparent magnitudes of the field stars from their instrumental magnitudes , are implicitly assumed to be valid for the leuschner and kpno data . from the apparent magnitudes of the field stars , we find the scaling relation for the nights that were not photometric and scale the sn instrumental magnitude to an apparent magnitude .",
    "although the loral chips were changed in the middle of the lick program , the two ccds were very similar ( both loral ) and the filters remained the same , so nearly the same transformation should apply .",
    "the lack of independent transformations for the leuschner and kpno data increases the uncertainties of these data but by an amount that is difficult to quantify .",
    "unfortunately , the leuschner system that was used is no longer available for calibration ; however , we still obtain consistent results between lick and leuschner .",
    "there were only three kpno measurements , and again , they are consistent with the other results .",

    "the line segments connecting the points have no significance other than to aid the reader in distinguishing between different sne and to indicate general trends .",
    "the time of maximum light for sn  1993y is uncertain .",
    "based on its spectra , it was estimated to be either around august 26 ( filippenko & matheson 1993 ) or september 1 ( dressler & sargent 1993 ) . for this paper , we adopt august 26 as the date of peak brightness .",
    "the observations of sn  1993y are therefore from 31  d to 137  d past maximum .",
    "normal type  ia sne show a decrease in the decline rate to a slow linear magnitude decline at around 40  d past maximum in @xmath43 and @xmath44 and at @xmath41 60  d in @xmath45 .",
    "this is evident in our light curves for sn 1993y , with the change in slope occurring some time between october 1 ( @xmath41 36  d after maximum ) and october 18 ( @xmath41 53  d after maximum ) in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and around october 27 ( @xmath41 62  d after maximum ) in @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath44 maximum seems to have occurred late in the plateau . in @xmath45 , there is a more distinct peak .",
    "it is evident from the @xmath44 and @xmath45 light curves that there is a change in the post - maximum rate of decline around jd 2,449,800  the decline rates become steeper .",
    "there is a similar change in @xmath43 at about jd 2,449,860 .",
    "we fit a linear decline to the data in @xmath43 after jd 2,449,700 but prior to 2,449,860 , and in @xmath44 for all data after jd 2,449,800 .",
    "the calculated rates of decline are shown in table  7 , along with the decline rates for another type  iin , sn  1988z ( rate from 110  d to 450  d past maximum ; turatto et al .",
    "1993 ) , and a peculiar type  ii , sn  1993j ( rate from about 200  d to 400  d after maximum ; richmond et al .",
    "sn  1994y demonstrates a much more rapid decline than sn  1988z , but one that is on the same order of magnitude as sn  1993j .",
    "two indications imply that the mass of the ejecta in sn  1994y was small .",
    "the brightness of sn  1994y remained at a plateau for only several weeks ( instead of several months , as do most sne ii - p ) , which suggests a small ejecta mass , since the duration of the plateau phase depends on how long the effective photosphere takes to work its way back through the hydrogen envelope of the star into the inner regions .",
    "a short phase indicates that the hydrogen envelope is not massive ( or that the sn was expanding much more quickly than usual ) .",
    "also , barbon et al .  ( 1995 ) and richmond et al .  ( 1996 ) indicate in the case of sn  1993j that the small amount of mass ejected , implied from its double peak , leads to a decrease in the efficiency of @xmath46-ray trapping ; this generates a faster rate of decline than the 0.98 mag per 100  d resulting from the radioactive decay of @xmath47co , which powers the late - time light curves of normal type  ii - p sne .",
    "the similarity in the decline rates of sn  1994y and sn  1993j , again , suggests that the ejecta of sn  1994y were also small in mass .    finally , the @xmath42 and @xmath43 light curves exhibit another change in their rates of decline beginning around jd 2,449,925 , leveling off to about 0.140.15 mag per 100  d. this is similar to the very late - time decline rate of 0.150.16 mag per 100  d seen in sn  1988z between 730  d and 1150  d ( turatto et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is a period well after our observations of sn  1994y .",
    "we suspect that interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar gas is providing additional light , as in the case for sn  1988z .",
    "however , the flattening of the light curves suggests that this process becomes more pronounced at an earlier time in sn  1994y , which again may be a result of the small ejecta mass .",
    "figure 15 shows the color curves of the nine type  ia sne .",
    "note that these values have not been corrected for reddening .",
    "there are large variations in the late - time @xmath48 template color curve given by riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) ; we have chosen a typical one , but there is a substantial difference between our observations and this template .",
    "sn  1993y may be more reddened than most of the other sne  ia presented here .",
    "the proximity of sn  1994c to the host galaxy s nucleus and the sn s very red color at early times suggest that it suffered significant reddening or was intrinsically red .",

    "sn  1988z had an initial @xmath49 @xmath50 0.4 mag , followed by a leveling off at later times to @xmath51 @xmath50 0.64 mag ( turatto et al .",
    "1993 ) . due to the ambiguity of the time of maximum for sn  1994y , it is difficult to indicate the colors at peak brightness .",
    "however , at the assumed time of @xmath42 maximum , @xmath51 is between 0.12 and 0.25 mag .",
    "furthermore , @xmath51 at later times also seems to be approaching a plateau around 0.5 mag .",
    "@xmath52 appears to increase monotonically , almost linearly , with time .",
    "@xmath48 , on the other hand , is @xmath530.15 mag about two weeks prior to @xmath42 maximum , reddens to a peak at or above 0.27 mag some time after two months , then turns blueward for the duration of our observations , ending a year from @xmath42 maximum at @xmath530.78 mag .",
    "the @xmath52 and @xmath48 color curves at late times show the growing strength of @xmath44 relative to @xmath43 and @xmath45 , thus suggesting that the h@xmath1 line is getting stronger relative to the continuum , and optical spectra confirm this conclusion ( filippenko 1997 ; matheson & filippenko 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "equivalent width is 1200    on 1995 january 25 , @xmath54    on april 22 , and even larger at later times . ]",
    "this explains the lack of a change in the rate of decline at late times of the @xmath44 light curve , since most of the light is concentrated in the h@xmath1 emission .",
    "we can calculate the absolute magnitude of sn  1994y , for which we have data near maximum light .",
    "burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) determine the galactic extinction to ngc  5371 ( the host of sn  1994y ) to be @xmath55 = 0.00 mag . using the distance modulus to ngc  5371 , @xmath56 mag ( tully 1988 ) , the resulting absolute magnitudes are shown in table  8 .",
    "peak @xmath42 brightness is @xmath57 mag .",
    "average type  ii supernovae have @xmath58 mag , but the dispersion is quite large , @xmath59 mag ( miller & branch 1990 ) .",
    "like sn  1988z , which has a @xmath60 mag ( turatto et al .",
    "1993 ) , sn  1994y is more luminous than the typical sn  ii but not abnormally so .",
    "we presented @xmath24 photometry of the type  iin sn  1994y and the type ia sne  1993y , 1993z , 1993ae , 1994b , 1994c , 1994 m , 1994q , 1994ae , and 1995d .",
    "all observations were done using telescopes of diameter 1  m or less .",
    "light curves of sn  1993y and sn  1993z exhibit late - time rates of decline very similar to those of typical sne  ia .",
    "the color curves of sn  1993y suggest that it suffers more reddening than most of the other sne  ia presented here .",
    "sn  1994c may also have been significantly reddened or was intrinsically red .",
    "the light curves of sn  1994y show that it remained at a plateau near maximum light for several weeks , with no definitive date of peak brightness .",
    "the light curves also suggest that the ejecta mass was small .",
    "the estimated absolute magnitude of sn  1994y shows that it , like the sn  iin  1988z , was slightly more luminous than normal sne  ii .",
