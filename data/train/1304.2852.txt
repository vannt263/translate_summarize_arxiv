    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions , the triangularity , squarity ( fourth - order ) , and higher - order deformations originate from fluctuations in the initial participant geometry .",

    "the contributions from jets survive , thus allowing us to study the interplay between hard - scattered partons and the medium .",
