    "over recent decades the hierarchical assembly of galaxies @xcite has become a paradigm of modern @xmath6 cold dark matter cosmology . whereas the assembly of dark - matter halos is now reasonably well modeled and understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the _ baryonic _ growth of galaxies through gas accretion @xcite and mergers @xcite has turned out to be much more challenging to simulate",
    ". some key issues of current theoretical and observational interest are the relative contributions of gas accretion and mergers to galaxy assembly , the apparent coevolution of supermassive black holes and spheroids @xcite , and the effects of gaseous outflows in slowing  or possibly even quenching  the galactic growth process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mergers of gas - rich galaxies can offer insights on at least two of these issues .",
    "especially major mergers ( i.e. , those with mass ratios @xmath7 ) often lead to intense starbursts and even some agn activity , each of which can drive strong gaseous outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in trying to assess the relative influence of starbursts and agn activity on the subsequent evolution of merger remnants , their individual durations and relative intensities matter , as does the detailed sequence of their occurrence",
    "whereas starbursts tend to peak close to the time of coalescence of the nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , agn activity may last longer and be more sporadic .",
    "observational studies of gas - rich mergers and their remnants have found peak agn activity delayed by typically @xmath010@xmath810@xmath9 yr relative to the peaking of starbursts @xcite , in rough agreement with theoretical estimates based on @xmath10-body plus hydrodynamical simulations suggesting agn delays of 10@xmath11 yr to a few 10@xmath8 yr , with a wide scatter @xcite .",
    "a problem for all studies involving not only ongoing mergers , but also merger remnants is the uncertainty about the remnants past merger history : what kinds of galaxies merged , and what were their gas contents and mass ratios ?",
    "our ignorance of such important details in well - known active merger remnants as , e.g. , ngc  5128 and ngc  1316 is both surprising and embarrassing .",
    "clearly , a few cases of well - studied merger remnants with known merger history could provide welcome checks on observational claims based on larger , statistical studies .    in this regard ,",
    "the prototypical merger remnant ngc  7252 would seem to hold great promise .",
    "it is the only _ remnant _ whose past merger history has been simulated in some detail @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that two gas - rich spirals began merging less than 1  gyr ago , coalesced about 220 myr ago , and have transformed themselves into some sort of modern - day protoelliptical @xcite .",
    "much is known about its gas contents and kinematics @xcite , post - starburst stellar populations @xcite , and system of massive young star clusters formed during the merger @xcite .    yet , until the present study no sign of agn activity in ngc  7252 was found , leaving us in the dark concerning the possible presence of any supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , its mass , activity , and recent growth history .",
    "admittedly , one could construe the presence of considerable amounts of molecular gas in the small central disk ( @xmath12@xmath13 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of neutral hydrogen in the tidal tails ( @xmath14 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as evidence that ngc  7252 experienced no quasar phase in its recent history .",
    "yet , gas from the tidal tails keeps falling back into the remnant @xcite and replenishing the central gas disk .",
    "hence , it may be obliterating earlier evidence  if it existed  that strong agn activity expelled most or all of the central gas .",
    "our serendipitous discovery of an extended emission - line nebulosity in ngc  7252 promises to shed new light on the question of the presence of a central smbh and its past and present activity .",

    "`` '' show , the projected distribution of the ionized gas can be naturally divided into four main areas : ( 1 ) a central gas disk very bright in ; ( 2 ) a ne stretch ( or `` front '' ) best seen in  and lying roughly parallel to the nw tail of tidal debris seen in panels _ a _ and _ b _ ; ( 3 ) a long southern stretch of gas best visible in  ( panel _ d _ ) and extending from the e tail westward past the central disk and through the region of the  all the way to a string of bright  regions ending with ; and ( 4 ) a faint nw stretch of gas seen only in  and containing various faint and fuzzy  regions ( panels _ d _ and _ f _ ) .",
    "the _ central disk _ of ionized and molecular gas extends to a radius of about 7  ( 2.2 kpc ) and rotates with @xmath60110 , corresponding to @xmath61  with the uncertainty of the disk inclination ( @xmath62 ) included @xcite .",
    "as can be seen on _ hst _ broad - band images , it hosts a large number of young star clusters and ob associations arranged in spirally patterns , leading to its nickname `` minispiral '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an interesting peculiarity is that the gas disk seems to feature a small `` hole '' at the nucleus , first noticed in the ionized gas as a likely `` 12  hole near the center '' by @xcite and then also seen in the molecular gas ( co ) distribution by @xcite .",
    "this hole , if representing a central cavity of a few hundred parsecs diameter in the gas distribution , may tell us something about recent activity in the nucleus ( see   [ sec45 ] ) .",
    "the _ ne stretch _ of ionized gas , brighter in  than in ( figs .",
    "[ fig01]_d _ and [ fig01]_c _ ) , coincides with a  @xmath1215 kpc long dust lane ( or system of dust lanes ) along the inner edge of the nw tail , as can be seen by comparing figures 5b and 5d of @xcite .",
    "this extensive dust lane makes it clear that the nw tail passes _ in front _ of the main body before looping around it in the southeast @xcite . by association",
    ", the ne stretch of ionized gas must lie in front of the main stellar body of ngc  7252 as well .",
    "similarly , the _ s stretch _ of ionized gas is clearly associated with the stellar debris of the e tail , best seen in figures  [ fig01]_a _ and [ fig01]_b_. since the  ( fig .  [ fig01]_c _ ) appears well lined up with the general  emission along that tail ( fig .",
    "[ fig01]_d _ ) , it seems likely to be part of the tail gas . in   [ sec34 ]",
    "we will use its kinematics to verify that this indeed seems to be the case .",
    "the e tail itself passes _ behind _ the main body of ngc  7252 , as suggested by the strongly negative line - of - sight velocity ( @xmath63230 ) of near its west end (   [ sec34 ] ) , the kinematics of the  gas along the tail @xcite , and @xmath10-body simulations reproducing the observed tail shapes and velocities @xcite .",
    "hence , the  itself probably also lies behind the main body of the remnant .",
    "the faint _ nw stretch _ of ionized gas is more difficult to place in space . by its projected location and orientation",
    ", it seems to form part of the `` w loop '' seen on deep photographs @xcite and in figure  [ fig01]_b_. if so , it may be a continuation of the e tail material that is falling back into the remnant @xcite .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of about @xmath6360  for one of its faint regions ( unpublished ) seems to agree at least in sign , if not necessarily in magnitude , with this interpretation .",
    "the  distribution also seems to indicate continuity along the loop @xcite , though with coarse resolution .",
    "yet , the continuity can not be established beyond any doubt from our @xmath32 , @xmath30 , and  images , which all fail to show a direct luminous connection between emission from the nw stretch and emission from the e tail that seems to end just past .",
    "perhaps the apparent gap in luminosity is due to some dust obscuration , or else the w `` loop '' is only apparent .",
    "we do not pursue this detail any further here , given that it does not directly impact our discussion of the  and its properties .",
    "the apparent structure of the  itself is , of course , of interest .",
    "perhaps the most striking features are the apparent filaments ( `` streamers '' ) extending from the ridge of highest surface brightness in  to the south .",
    "notice their different relative brightnesses in  and .",
    "whereas the westernmost filament appears brightest in , it is the easternmost that appears brightest in .",
    "another feature of interest is a possible dust lane that _ may _ run along the e - w ridge of highest  surface brightness in a step - like fashion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01]_e _ ) .",
    "the reality of this possible dust lane is  however  difficult to establish , given the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the  image .",
    "we close this discussion of the ionized - gas morphology with a cautionary note . in the absence of high - resolution 2d kinematic information ,",
    "any specific area of the projected ionized - gas distribution in this messy merger remnant could lie anywhere along the line of sight , and its preliminary assignment to a certain depth level within the remnant might have to be revised in the light of future new evidence .    ,",

    "note that the spectral continuum contains not only light from cluster s101 , but also some background light from the galaxy .",
    "disentangling these two continuum contributions proved too difficult , mainly because of the lack of an atmospheric - dispersion corrector ( adc ) at the clay telescope . as a result and despite certain precautions , the spectrum of cluster s101which appears nearly as a point source  experienced different slit losses as a function of wavelength than did the spectrum of the galaxy background .",
    "the same cause likely explains the mismatch of the cluster continuum where the blue and red spectra overlap .",

    "unfortunately , these models do not reproduce the  observations in sufficient detail to permit locating the nebula accurately along our line of sight ( j.  e.  barnes , private communication ) .",

    "in contrast , ic  2497 and hanny s voorwerp at @xmath267 represent a relatively nearby case of recent qso - like luminosity followed by a very strong decline , explaining why this system was discovered first and will likely remain the prototype of its class .",
    "in short , ngc  7252 s  seems to be the lowest - luminosity ionization echo discovered so far .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  7252 itself must have reached at least seyfert - like luminosity to still excite the nebula as observed , yet has since faded by several orders of magnitude to a very low , so far undetected activity level .",

    "; see also @xcite ) , this major merger began with the first close approach of two gas - rich disk galaxies about 640 myr ago and was essentially complete when the two nuclei coalesced @xmath0220 myr ago ( times scaled to @xmath19  mpc@xmath20 ) . during this period , shock - induced star and cluster formation was enhanced by a factor of @xmath04 over normal , leading to the spectacular set of several hundred young halo globular clusters @xcite , and peaking shortly after the coalescence of the two nuclei ( see fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "presently , about 220 myr after coalescence , intense star and cluster formation continues mainly in the central gas disk ( `` minispiral , ''   [ sec31 ] ) .    if our conclusion is correct that over the past 0.020.20 myr the nuclear activity has declined from a seyfert - like level by at least three orders of magnitude (   [ sec44 ] ) , then it must have fluctuated by comparable amounts over the past 200@xmath234myr .",
    "otherwise , we would be privileged to observe ngc  7252 just at the moment when its previous , approximately steady seyfert - like activity suddenly declined ; this seems highly unlikely .",
    "hence , we conclude that _ the  must be witness to some sputtering late agn activity with surprisingly large luminosity amplitudes ( @xmath268 ) in ngc  7252",
    ". _    yet , even at the present time the central gas disk contains @xmath12@xmath269  of molecular gas @xcite , and the tidal tails and loop contain another @xmath12@xmath270  of  @xcite .",
    "hence , _ if _ the nucleus reached much higher , qso - like levels of activity in the past  as might be expected around or shortly after the time of nuclear coalescence  then these hypothetical high levels of nuclear activity have failed to rid the remnant of its gas , both in the central disk and in the tidal tails and w loop .",
    "this sobering fact should temper any theoretical assumptions that gas - rich major mergers and their ensuing nuclear activity necessarily clean the remnant galaxies to a `` red - and - dead '' state .",
    "there are some obvious questions concerning the  that we havent addressed so far .",
    "perhaps most important among them are : ( 1 ) why does the  extend only over @xmath010 kpc in projection if really it forms part of a much longer stream of tidal - tail gas falling back into the merger remnant ? and ( 2 ) , what causes the striking filaments ( `` streamers , '' fig .  [ fig01 ] and   [ sec31 ] ) in the  that seem to extend from the bright ridge of  emission to the sse ?    in answer to the first question , it is tempting to speculate that ionizing radiation may escape  or have escaped  from the nucleus of ngc  7252 in a cone - shaped volume , perhaps constrained by some central torus of dense circum - nuclear gas , as is often the case in seyfert galaxies .",
    "if so , the  simply marks the intersection of this cone - shaped volume with the eastern gaseous tidal tail .",

    "a detailed comparison of the  and  images of the ( fig .",
    "[ fig01]_c__f _ ) with fig .  7 of @xcite shows that the westernmost `` streamer '' of the  coincides closely with a steep drop in the  surface mass density , marked also by a strong velocity gradient .",
    "it is conceivable that a so far undetected plasma jet from the nucleus is ablating the , which might explain the limited extent of the nebula , or that an already more centrally - wrapped stream of gas is slamming into the tidal - tail  stream and shock - ionizing it .",
    "our strongest arguments against both possibilities have been provided by ( i ) the narrow velocity widths of most nebular emission lines (   [ sec331 ] ) , ( ii ) the low temperature of the nebula (   [ sec41 ] ) , and ( iii ) the apparent continuity in line - of - sight velocities along the tidal - tail stream and nebula (   [ sec34 ] , esp .  fig .  [ fig06 ] ) . yet , the presence of some unexplained broader line wings near the base of especially the  lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig04]_c _ ) may indicate increased turbulence in at least part of the gas of the nebula .",
    "spectral mapping of the entire  with an ifu spectrograph at a high signal - to - noise ratio ( much higher than that of our mage spectrum ) will be required to address this issue .",
    "such mapping might also help address our question about the nature and origin of the striking _",
    "filaments_. it would yield valuable quantitative information concerning the density and excitation variations present across the  and filaments .",
    "a visual intercomparison of figs .",
    "[ fig01]_e _ and [ fig01]_f _ suggests that the excitation ( @xmath147 $ \\lambda$5007}}/{\\mbox{${\\rm h}\\beta$}}$ ] ) of the easternmost filament is significantly lower than that of the westernmost filament (   [ sec31 ] ) , a fact remaining to be explained .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature of the filaments is their projected geometry : they seem to run more nearly _",
    "perpendicular _ to any radius drawn from the nucleus than parallel ( fig .",
    "[ fig01]_c__f _ ) .",
    "this geometry would seem to argue against the filaments being minor gas streams flowing away from the nucleus ( driven , e.g. , by a hypothetical jet ) or falling toward it .",
    "rather , they may represent either density variations in the gas or  perhaps  fine structure in the ionization echo indicative of temporal variations in the central ionizing radiation .",
    "the above - mentioned spectral mapping seems then to be a necessary first step toward a better understanding of their nature and origin .",
    "a third interesting question is whether there is any likely connection between the presence of the  and the presence of the string of  regions further downstream in the w loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] and ",
    "  [ sec31 ] , [ sec34 ] ) .",
    "such a connection could , e.g. , be created by any mechanism that currently excites the  and whose direction remains fixed over a prolonged period . if so , could the same mechanism have compressed the gas from which the string of  regions has formed ?",
    "the answer is very likely negative , as the following simple estimate shows .",
    "the projected distance from the center of the  to the approximate center of the five  regions is about @xmath271 kpc .",
    "the tidal - tail gas near ( s101 ) moves with @xmath272 (   [ sec34 ] ) which , according to the best model simulations of ngc  7252 @xcite , must be close to the fallback velocity within the e tail . traversing the above projected distance at this velocity takes about 35 myr , or easily 510@xmath5 the age of a giant  region excited by o stars . since the true distance between the  and the  regions is probably considerably larger than the projected 8 kpc , the collapse of the tail gas hypothetically triggered by exposure to the same mechanism that presently excites the  would have taken an order of magnitude longer than the age of the  regions .",
    "this seems unlikely , though not necessarily impossible .",
    "alternatively , however , either a directional change of some hypothetical jet or a past more isotropic event could have  in principle  both cleared the path to the  and caused the formation of the  regions by compressing the gas there and inducing star formation .",
    "such complex phenomena are observed in , e.g. , the ne radio lobe of ngc  5128 @xcite .    in order to better understand these various issues , _ improved model simulations _ of the merger that occurred in ngc  7252 will clearly be at least as important as new observations . figuring out the true spatial geometry of the ionized gas in this nearby merger remnant holds great promise , since it will help pin down the time delays involved in the ionization history .",
    "however , it will take major new modeling efforts with improved gas hydrodynamics to fully realize this promise .",

    "we measure an electron density of @xmath114@xmath115 @xmath110with likely values mostly @xmath27610 @xmath110in the bright ridge covered by the mage slit , and find an upper limit of @xmath117 @xmath110 along the entire @xmath010 kpc slice of the nebula covered by the ldss-3 slit . in agreement with these low densities ,",
    "the internal visual extinction determined from the balmer - line decrement is also low , @xmath277 mag . given the high nebular excitation inferred from the flux ratio @xmath278 $ \\lambda$5007}})/f_0({\\mbox{${\\rm h}\\beta$ } } ) = 10.03\\pm 0.25 $ ] , our upper limit for the electron temperature , @xmath124k , is surprisingly low . finally , at the distance of 66.2 mpc adopted for ngc  7252 the integrated luminosity of the nebula is @xmath131  in the strongest  line and @xmath279  in the strongest balmer line .    \\4 . in three standard diagnostic diagrams , the line ratios measured for the  place it clearly in the domain of seyfert galaxies and well away from the dividing line between seyferts and liners .",
    "several arguments suggest that _ the nebula is most likely photoionized by a central source in ngc  7252 with a power - law spectrum . _",
    "the alternative possibility that the nebula might be excited by high - velocity shocks of @xmath165 , necessary to explain its measured high excitation , seems unlikely because of the low nebular temperature ( @xmath2808900k ) and internal velocity dispersion ( @xmath09.6 ) .",
    "a comparison with photoionization models in the literature then suggests a subsolar gas metallicity of @xmath12@xmath142 . this rough estimate is consistent with the metallicity of @xmath281  that we determine for , a 30 doradus - like giant  region located 8 kpc in projection downstream from the nebula .",
    "our conclusion that the  is photoionized by a central power - law source in ngc  7252 is further supported by the fact that in the above - mentioned diagnostic diagrams it falls among a group of eelrs observed by @xcite around five quasars , where photoionization is the only viable explanation .",
    "yet , an observational and literature search for agn activity in ngc  7252from x - rays through the uv  optical to near - ir , mid - ir , and radio wavelengths",
    " fails to yield any significant detection .",
    "although vigorous star formation occurs in the central gas disk of @xmath01.6 kpc radius at the rate of @xmath06.3 , the nucleus itself appears presently inactive .",
    "the perhaps most stringent upper limit for any agn activity is set by x - ray observations of ngc  7252 , from which we estimate an upper luminosity limit of @xmath220  for the nucleus .",
    "this upper limit is three orders of magnitude lower than the minimum nuclear ionizing luminosity of @xmath257  necessary to excite the  and produce its observed  emission .",
    "hence , there is a discrepancy of at least @xmath282 between the ionizing luminosity that the nebula was exposed to when it emitted the photons recorded on our images and spectra , and the low luminosity of the presently observed nucleus .",
    "\\6 . assessing all available evidence ,",
    "we conclude that the  of n7252 is most likely a _",
    "faint ionization echo . _",
    "it shows clear signs of being excited by a mildly active nucleus , yet the ionizing luminosity of this nucleus has declined by at least three orders of magnitude over the past 20,000200,000 years . in many ways",
    "this nebula resembles the prototypical ` hanny s voorwerp , ' a bright likely ionization echo recently discovered near the still weakly active galaxy ic  2497 ; but in ngc  7252 its size is 3@xmath5 smaller and its  luminosity @xmath0100@xmath5 lower .",
    "we propose that it should be classified as an eelr ( extended emission - line region ) despite falling well short of the minimum line luminosity of @xmath283  often adopted in the definition of eelrs .",
    "if so , the  is the lowest - luminosity ionization echo and eelr discovered so far , indicative of recent , probably _ sputtering agn activity of seyfert - like intensity in ngc  7252_. it is the first sign of any agn activity found in this merger remnant , occurring about 640 myr after the merger of two gas - rich disk galaxies began and @xmath0220 myr after the two nuclei coalesced .",
    "its proximity and the rich multi - wavelength data  including detailed gas kinematics  available for ngc  7252 hold great promise for further study of black - hole feeding and feedback .",
    "this promise should encourage new model simulations  with improved hydrodynamics  of this intriguing merger remnant and its gaseous contents .",
