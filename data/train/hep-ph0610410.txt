    "the standard approach ( sa ) for theoretical investigation of dis structure function @xmath4 involves dglap@xcite and standard fits@xcite for the initial parton densities . in the sa framework",

    "the reason for such asymmetric treating the @xmath3 and @xmath0 -evolutions in sa is that dglap was originally constructed for operating at large @xmath0 where @xmath0- contributions from higher loops were small and could be neglected . in other words , the @xmath0 -evolution can be neglected at large @xmath0 .",
    "however , in the small-@xmath0 region the situation looks opposite : logarithms of @xmath0 are becoming quite sizable and should be accounted to all orders in @xmath11 .",
    "the total resummation of leading logarithms of @xmath0 was first done in refs .",
    "@xcite in the double - logarithmic approximation so that @xmath11 was kept fixed at an unknown scale and later in refs .",

    "it converge to the dglap- parametrization at large @xmath0 but differs from it at small @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , it is known that , despite dglap lacks the total resummation of @xmath13 , it successfully operates at @xmath14 . as a result",
    ", the common opinion was formed that not only the total resummation of dl contributions in refs .",
    "@xcite but also the much more accurate calculations performed in refs .",
    "@xcite should be out of use at available @xmath0 and might be of some importance in a distant future at extremely small @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we argued against such a point of view and explained why sa can be so successful at small @xmath0 : in order to be able to describe the available experimental data , sa uses the singular fits of refs .",

    "@xcite . using the results of ref  @xcite",
    "allows to simplify the rather sophisticated structure of the standard fits .",
    "another essential difference between sa and our description of @xmath1 is the obvious fact that dglap works at the kinematic regions of large @xmath3 whereas our approach is valid for large and small @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is important in particular for theoretical explanation of the compass collaboration results . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that @xmath1 practically does not depend on @xmath0 at small @xmath0 , even at @xmath14 .",
    "instead , it depends on the total invariant energy @xmath16 .",
    "experimental investigation of this dependence is extremely interesting because according to our results @xmath1 , being positive at small @xmath16 , can turn negative at greater values of this variable .",
    "the position of the turning point is sensitive to the ratio between the initial quark and gluon densities , so its experimental detection would enable to estimate this ratio .",
    "in dglap , @xmath1 is expressed through convolutions of the coefficient functions and evolved parton distributions . as convolutions look simpler in terms of integral transforms , it is convenient to represent @xmath1 in the form of the mellin integral .",

    "the expression for the singlet @xmath1 is similar , though more involved .",
    "both @xmath21 and @xmath6 are known in first two orders of the perturbative qcd . technically , it is simpler to calculate them at integer values of @xmath22 . in this case , the integrand of eq .",

    "such a resummation leads to the expressions for the coefficient functions different from the dglap ones .",

    "the results for different values of the ratio @xmath93 , @xmath91 are plotted in fig .",

    "when @xmath97 ( curve  2 ) , @xmath91 remains positive and not large until @xmath98 , turns negative at @xmath99 and falls afterwards rapidly with decreasing @xmath96 .",

    "it immediately leads to an interesting conclusion : the dglap fits for @xmath51 have been commonly believed to represent non - perturbative qcd effects but they actually mimic the contributions of the perturbative qcd , so the whole impact of the non - perturbative qcd on @xmath1 at small @xmath0 is not large and can be approximated by normalization constants .",
