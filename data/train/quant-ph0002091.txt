    "recent work by imamolu _",
    "et al_@xcite _  _ suggested a promising scheme for observing photon blockade in a highly non - linear cavity , where the change in the kerr nonlinearity due to single photon effects was enough to make the cavity non - resonant with modes of more than one photon .",
    "as described in their work , such a device could work as a single - photon turnstile , similar to that realised recently by kim _",
    "et al _ @xcite in a semiconductor junction , which might be useful for quantum computation and the generation of non - classical light fields .",
    "the work by imamolu _",
    "et al _ was based on the use of the adiabatic elimination procedure and later studies@xcite showed that the breakdown of the procedure in the high dispersion limit leads to prohibitive restrictions on the parameter space where photon blockade could be observed in a multi - atom system .",
    "further to this , werner and imamolu@xcite and rebi _",
    "et al_@xcite suggested that these problems could be overcome by using a system with a single atom .",
    "the question of observing photon blockade in multi - atom systems is of more than just theoretical interest .  possible schemes for observing photon blockade",
    "depend on directing a low flux atomic beam through a high finesse cavity and this implies that there will be an uncertainty in the number of atoms present in the cavity at any given time .",
    "we show that the photon blockade , in certain circumstances , remains strong even for a fluctuation in the atom number .",
    "recent work@xcite has highlighted the importance of employing a mutual detuning between the cavity and the semiclassical coupling field to shift the many atom degenerate state out of resonance .",
    "our work builds on this idea and presents a detailed atom - cavity dressed state calculation showing the parameter regimes which offer the best prospects for the observations of photon blockade in one , two and three atom systems .",
    "we show that current technology should allow the construction of a system exhibiting photon blockade .",
    "we suggest that photon blockade can be best realised , not in a mot as originally envisaged by imamolu _",

    "photon blockade in a cavity can be explained quite simply .",
    "an external field drives a cavity that is resonant when there are zero or one photon in the cavity and non - resonant for two ( or more ) photons .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing a medium into the cavity , exhibiting a large kerr non - linearity which alters the refractive index as a function of the intensity .  in general",
    ", one would expect to find large non - linearities in systems exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "consider a four level atom as depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the energy levels are labeled in order of increasing energy as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with associated energies of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively and transition frequencies @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 transition is driven by a strong classical coupling field , with frequency @xmath11 , rabi frequency @xmath12 , detuned from the @xmath13 transition by an amount @xmath14 .",
    "the atoms are in a cavity with resonance frequency @xmath15 which is detuned from the @xmath16 transition by an amount @xmath17 , detuned from the @xmath18 transition by an amount @xmath19 and not interacting with the @xmath13 transition .  the detunings @xmath20 and @xmath21 are set equal to ensure that the @xmath22 transition is driven by a two photon resonance .",
    "we therefore define the mutual detuning , @xmath23 .",
    "the cavity is driven by an additional classical field with frequency @xmath24 and power , @xmath25 .",
    "we analyse the effect of this field by examining the dressed states of the atom - cavity system .",
    "this configuration of fields and atomic levels is called the n configuration and has been considered previously @xcite .  the cavity linewidth is @xmath26 .",
    "the atom - cavity mode coupling is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to atomic levels , @xmath30 is the electric dipole moment of the transition , @xmath31 is the cavity volume and @xmath32 is the permittivity of free space .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system with @xmath33 atoms in the frame rotating at the cavity resonance frequency in the rotating - wave approximation is@xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the decay rate from atomic state @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 is the cavity photon annihilation ( creation ) operator and @xmath41 is the atomic operator @xmath42 acting on atom @xmath43 .",
    "we find the dressed states by diagonalizing @xmath44 .",
    "fortunately , @xmath44 is block diagonal in the bare state basis .",
    "the @xmath45th block can be identified by starting with the state @xmath46 , representing all the atoms in state @xmath47 and the cavity field in the @xmath45 photon state @xmath48 , and finding the closed set of states coupled to @xmath46 by @xmath44 .",
    "diagonalizing this block gives the @xmath45 quanta manifold of dressed states .",
    "we first consider the case of a single atom in the cavity .",
    "the zero quanta manifold consists solely of the state @xmath49 .",
    "the one quantum manifold is spanned by the states @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 the corresponding block of @xmath53  can be written in matrix form in this basis as @xmath54   \\label{eq : matrixform:1atom1photon}\\ ] ] where the superscript on @xmath55 refers to the number of atoms and the subscript to the number of quanta in the system .  in order to simplify the expressions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors , we assume @xmath56 .",
    "the figures which follow , however , have been generated using non - zero values of @xmath26 .  diagonalising the matrix @xmath57 with @xmath58",
    "gives the dressed state energies @xmath59 and corresponding dressed states @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively",
    ".  in this form , the real part of the eigenstate corresponds to the state energy and the imaginary part to the width of the state .",
    "these eigenstates form the well known mollow triplet @xcite and are presented in figure 2(a ) as a function of the scaled mutual detuning , @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is important to express the form of the central dressed state , @xmath67 which is @xmath68    photon blockade will occur in this dressed - state picture when the cavity driving field resonantly couples the zero to one quantum manifolds , and only weakly couples the one and two quanta manifolds .",
    "we can gauge the extent of these couplings by treating each transition driven by the cavity driving field as a separate , closed two - state system .",
    "this approach will break down when multiple states are excited simultaneously",
    ".  however , in situtations where the photon blockade effect occurs , the number of dressed states that are significantly occupied will be minimal and our two - state model should give a reasonably accurate picture of the degree of excitation of each transition .",
    "the effect of the cavity driving field on the cavity - atom system can be treated by including the additional term on the right hand side of equation [ eq : hamiltonian ] @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the external field - cavity mode coupling strength for a cavity mirror transmittance of @xmath71*.  * in our two state model the cavity driving field drives transitions between lower and upper states , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in the @xmath45 and @xmath74 quanta manifolds respectively .",
    "the effective rabi frequency of the transition is given by @xmath75 under these conditions , the steady state population of @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the detuning of the external cavity driving field from the @xmath79 transition and @xmath80 the decay rate of state @xmath73 , assumed to take population from @xmath73 to @xmath81 .",
    "note that we have ignored the decay rate from @xmath81 .",
    "we denote the maximum value of @xmath82 over all transitions from a given lower state to all possible upper states in the @xmath45 quantum manifold as @xmath83 . for ideal photon blockade",
    ", we require @xmath84 for the transition from the ground state , @xmath85 to the maximally coupled one quantum dressed state @xmath86 .",
    "for the case that @xmath87 , we note that @xmath88 will be small , because @xmath67 contains no proportion of atomic state @xmath2 .",
    "thus it is possible to inject a single quantum of energy into the atom - cavity system for modest values of @xmath89 .",
    "ideal blockade also requires that @xmath90 be negligible for transitions between @xmath91 and states @xmath76 of the two quantum manifold .",
    "we next consider the two atom , one quantum manifold of states .  in this case , the basis states are @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 and the corresponding block of @xmath53 can be written in matrix form as @xmath97   \\label{eq : matrixform:2atom1photon}\\ ] ] diagonalising @xmath98 yields the eigenvalues @xmath99 with associated dressed states @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath67 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the dressed state energies are plotted in figure 2(b ) for the same conditions as in figure 2(a ) .",
    "there are some important similarities between the spectrum of eigenstates for the one atom and two atom cases .  in each case",
    "there is a state with zero energy , indicating that transitions from the zero to the one quantum manifold are possible for a cavity driving field tuned to the cavity resonance @xmath15 .",
    "the states which are anti - crossing in each manifold are asymptotic to the lines@xmath104 and @xmath105 with the point of closest approach being at @xmath106 .",
    "it is also important to realise that although there are five distinct eigenstates only three of these eigenvalues will couple to the ground state of the atom cavity system , i.e. the matrix element @xmath107 is non - zero only for @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "for this reason only the optically active states @xmath110 , @xmath67 and @xmath111 are plotted in figure 2(b ) .",
    "we have also solved the analogous three and four atom hamiltonians and we summarise our results for the eigenstates in each case as @xmath112 where @xmath113 indicates the number of atoms in the cavity .",
    "the degeneracies of the eigenvalues presented in equations [ eq : eigenvalue : natom:1quantum ] are interesting to observe , namely the @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 values are all non - degenerate , whilst the @xmath117 and @xmath118 values are @xmath119 fold degenerate .",
    "( the latter values , @xmath117 and @xmath118 do not occur for @xmath120 ) .",
    "the presence of the zero eigenvalue , @xmath121 , indicates that it is possible to inject one photon into the atom - cavity system with a cavity driving field tuned to @xmath122 .",
    "now we consider the two quanta manifold for a cavity containing one atom .",
    "this manifold is spanned by the states @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 and the corresponding block of @xmath53  in matrix form is @xmath127\\ ] ] in order to observe photon blockade in such a system , it is essential that none of the eigenstates of @xmath128 are resonantly coupled by the cavity driving field to the occupied states of the one quantum manifold .  to achieve this ,",
    "we require @xmath129 , the smaller @xmath130 the greater the degree of photon blockade .",
    "a plot showing the eigenenergies of this system with associated linewidths , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the dressed state under consideration , is presented in figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) .  in each case @xmath133 ,",
    "@xmath134 , @xmath135 @xmath136 and in figure 3(a ) @xmath137 and the energies are plotted as a function of @xmath138 whereas in figure 3(b ) @xmath139 and the energies are plotted as a function of @xmath140 .",
    "the important features to recognise from these two traces is the shift of the smallest magnitude energy state from zero , indicating ( as highlighted in @xcite and @xcite ) that photon blockade will indeed be possible in the one atom case .",
    "similarly , for the two atom case , the basis states of the two quanta manifold are @xmath141 @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150,and @xmath151 where the notation is @xmath152 . in matrix form , the corresponding block of the hamiltonian is @xmath153\\ ] ] where @xmath154 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of @xmath155 are presented in figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) .  as in the two atom ,",
    "single quantum case there are optically inactive states , and these have been removed from the figures .",
    "figure 4(a ) was generated for @xmath133 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath136 .",
    "as can be seen , for this case there is a zero eigenvalue so we would expect that there would be resonant coupling from the single quantum manifold to the two quantum manifold by a cavity driving field tuned to @xmath15 and hence , photon blockade would not be observed in this case .",
    "however in figure 4(b ) we illustrate the effect of introducing a small mutual detuning , @xmath159 from state @xmath2 .",
    "the parameters used were @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath65 and @xmath136 .",
    "it is important to observe the shift of the smallest magnitude eigenvalue from zero .",
    "although this shift is less than for the corresponding single atom case , it is still feasible to consider building a cavity to observe this photon blockade .",
    "this point will be elaborated on in the conclusions@xcite .",
    "of critical importance to the experimental observation of photon blockade in atomic systems , is the question of how to trap single or small numbers of atoms within a small , high finesse optical cavity .",
    "we know of no demonstration of continuous trapping , however recent experiments conducted by hood _ et al_@xcite and mnstermann _ et al_@xcite have shown that it is possible to have a cavity with extremely low atom fluxes passing through it .",
    "this was achieved in @xcite by allowing atoms to fall from a leaky mot into the cavity and in @xcite by directing atoms out of a mot and into the cavity .",
    "one would expect such atomic ejections to be stochastic in nature and as a consequence , the probability of having a certain number of atoms in the cavity should follow poissonian statistics .  in order to build a device which uses photon blockade , it will therefore be necessary to ensure that significant photon blockade will be observed over as wide a range of atomic numbers as possible , otherwise the photon blockade could be lost and the performance of the device degraded .",
    "a complication in the experimental realisation of photon blockade is that the parameters chosen in the theoretical plots shown above were assumed to be independent variables .  in general",
    "this will not be the case unless great care is taken in the preparation of an experiment .",
    "specifically , for transitions in an alkali vapour which might realise the n configuration , one would expect the dipole moments of all relevant transitions to be of the same order , with the atom - cavity coupling set solely by the cavity volume , a parameter shared by both the @xmath163 and @xmath164 transitions .",
    "one would therefore expect @xmath165 .  also ,",
    "because of the shared cavity , the detuning parameters are not  independent , so if we assume that @xmath166 then we find that @xmath167 .",
    "these extra considerations will be included in the analysis to follow , which concentrates on experimentally realisable effects rather than the general theoretical demonstration presented above .",
    "we start by investigating photon blockade using the parameters @xmath168 , @xmath157 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .  for these values @xmath171 , as is expected due to the presence of the strongly absorbing state at the cavity resonance .    in figure 5 ( a )",
    "we show a pseudo - colour plot of @xmath130 as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath172 for the one atom two quanta case , where colour is indicative of the value of @xmath173 , blue being 0 and red being 0.5 .",
    "the graph clearly shows @xmath174 decreasing monotonically with @xmath172 , indicating the effectiveness of photon blockade correspondingly increasing .",
    "this is expected , as a large @xmath175 will give rise to a highly nonlinear system .",
    "also note that @xmath90 increases as @xmath176 increases , indicating that the photon blockade is a resonance phenomenon .    in figure 5(b )",
    "we show the analogous @xmath174 plot for two atoms .  in accord with the preliminary results which suggested that photon blockade was not possible in the multi - atom system@xcite we find @xmath177 in the vicinity of @xmath139 , implying that photon blockade will not be observable for these choices of parameters .",
    "however , by increasing the mutual detuning and employing a modest atom - cavity coupling , regions of strong photon blockade are observable , typified by the minimum recorded value on figure 5(b ) of @xmath178 .    the three atom case is shown in figure 5(c ) for the same parameter regime as the one and two atom cases .",
    "the form of @xmath130 is similar to that of the two atom case , with the same overall structure , but narrower regions where photon blockade should be observable , this is shown by the smaller blue region of figure 5(c ) than figure 5(b ) .",
    "again very low values of @xmath174 were obtained , with a minimum recorded value of @xmath179 .",
    "to use photon blockade as a tool for new quantum devices it is necessary to identify real systems in which these effects may be observed .  as an example of what may be achieved with the current state of the art , we take parameters from a recent experimental paper @xcite and make some minor assumptions about how they might apply to atoms falling through a high finesse cavity",
    "it should certainly be possible to achieve a coupling field rabi frequency of @xmath180 mhz , external field - cavity coupling strength of @xmath181mhz and hood _ et al _ achieve @xmath182 mhz and @xmath183 mhz .",
    "for a system based on transitions in the @xmath184rb d@xmath185 line @xcite we may assume @xmath186mhz and @xmath187 mhz .",
    "we ignore the zeeman magnetic sublevels since these form a simple , effective three level @xmath188 system ( for states @xmath0 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 ) for the situation under consideration @xcite .  assuming equal rates of radiative decay , these translate into our system as @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .  in figure 6(a ) we present a plot of @xmath196 as a function of @xmath172 and @xmath197 for one atom in the cavity , with the plots showing @xmath198 in ( b ) and ( c ) for one and two atoms respectively .",
    "there are some important features to note in figures 6 .  in 6(a )",
    "@xmath196 increases monotonically with @xmath172 and , for the scale used , is independant of @xmath63 .",
    "the value of @xmath199 is qualitatively very similar for one , two and three atoms , with the values of @xmath200 slightly increasing as the number of atoms increases .  as an example , for @xmath191 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 for one , two and three atoms respectively",
    ".  traces 6(b ) and ( c ) show @xmath174 for the one and two atom cases respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath130 for the one atom case is very small across the entire parameter space , indicating that photon blockade should be easy to observe for a single atom . of interest",
    "is the resonance in the vicinity of @xmath204 which will be discussed below .",
    "there is an extra resonance in the vicinity of @xmath205 for the one atom case , although this is not present to the same extent in the two and three atom cases .  for two atoms , and also for three atoms (",
    "not shown ) , the overall values ( away from the resonances ) of @xmath174 appear to increase with the number of atoms and are much larger than for the one atom case .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath174 for two and three atoms are extremely similar , with maximum values along the line @xmath206 of @xmath207 and @xmath208 for two and three atoms respectively .",
    "these observations would appear to agree with the intuitive idea that photon blockade would be more difficult in multi - atom systems and that there is a qualitative difference between the single atom case and multi - atom cases .",
    "the results for @xmath174 in the vicinity of @xmath209 are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the significance of this region is that we have @xmath210 so that the cavity is now resonant with the @xmath164 transition .  to our knowledge ,",
    "this situation has not been previously explored and the consequences it has for photon blockade are significant . in figure 7",
    "we present @xmath174 for one , two and three atoms in plots ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath211 shows no resonance phenomena and is described above , it is only by considering @xmath130 that the resonance is observed .  in 7(a ) we see generally small values for @xmath174 indicating that photon blockade should be observable .  with the exception of the ` shelf ' for @xmath212",
    ", @xmath174 has the a similar chevron shape to that observed in the ideal case , shown in figure 5(a ) , although with very much smaller values .  in figures 7(b ) and",
    "( c ) , we observe a roughly triangular region of low @xmath130 , superimposed on the background of @xmath130 noted earlier .",
    "values of @xmath213 are present where @xmath214 for both the two and three atom cases .",
    "this suggests that the non - linearity of the system is very large about this resonance .",
    "further investigations of this resonance will be done with increasing number of atoms to show how robust the photon blockade will be as any relaxation of the requirement for low number of atoms will enhance the prospects for experimental verification of this effect .",
    "the discussions above have used a system where the cavity is driven resonantly by the external field .  this has a significant drawback in trying to realise a continuously operating device inasmuch as",
    "when there are no atoms in the cavity , the cavity will absorb photons from the external field .  to overcome this using the on - resonance configuration , one must run the experiment in a pulsed mode to ensure that there are no photons in the cavity prior to atoms entering the cavity .",
    "there is , however , another alternative .",
    "this occurs when the cavity driving field is not tuned to the cavity resonance , but instead is tuned to a side resonance of the one atom dressed system . in this case",
    "there will be strong coupling between the external driving field and the cavity when there is one atom in the cavity and no coupling when there are zero atoms in the cavity .  by studying the form of the dressed state eigenvalues given in equation [ eq : eigenvalue : natom:1quantum ]",
    "it is clear that there is a dependence of the eigenvalue with the number of atoms so that it should be possible to choose @xmath215 such that the one - quantum manifold is only coupled into when there is only one atom in the cavity .",
    "these conditions are best met for the case that both @xmath216 and @xmath12 are small compared to @xmath217 to ensure the maximum shift in eigenvalues with number of atoms .",
    "we have presented detailed calculations which show the parameter space where photon blockade in one , two and three atom systems should be observable . by considering transitions on the @xmath218rb d@xmath185 line , we have suggested that photon blockade should be observable using current state of the art technology , such as has been recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "we have pointed out that strong photon blockade should be possible when the cavity resonance is tuned to the @xmath219 transition , despite a large mutual detuning , @xmath216 .",
    "this resonance may relax the requirements on the energy levels of the atomic species under consideration .",
