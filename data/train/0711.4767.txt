    "we observed a key ingredient of the classical mechanism behind hawking radiation , the generation of waves with negative frequencies @xcite .",
    "however , the measured conversion of positive into negative - frequency waves is significantly higher than expected from theory @xcite for reasons we do not yet understand .",

    "the event horizon generates pairs of quanta ; one particle of each pair emerges into space while its partner falls into the singularity .",
    "the quantum physics of pair creation at horizons is based on the features of classical wave - packet propagation @xcite as follows : figure [ fig : black ] shows a wave packet escaping from the horizon . in a thought experiment , hawking @xcite traced such wave packets backwards in time and realized that they originate from two distinct waves : one oscillating with positive frequencies and another one with negative frequencies .",
    "note that one can visualize negative frequencies in the way waves propagate in space and time , _",
    "i.e _ in space - time diagrams or videos , but negative frequencies do not directly appear in snapshots of wave packets .",
    "figure [ fig : diagrams ] compares the space - time diagrams of ordinary positive - frequency waves with the behavior of negative - frequency waves .",
    "the figure shows that the lines of equal phase in space - time have negative slopes for negative frequencies , as we discuss in sec .  2 .    , whereas the right diagrams shows a wave with negative @xmath0 and negative frequency @xmath1 in the co - moving frame .",
    "[ fig : diagrams],width=434 ]    the distinction between positive and negative frequencies is important for quantum fields @xcite : the positive frequencies distinguish the annihilation and the negative frequencies the creation operators . a process that mixes positive and negative frequencies thus creates particles ; the horizon spontaneously emits radiation .",
    "figure [ fig : black ] illustrates the wave packets of the particles that escape into space ; the particles that fall into the black hole are shown in figure [ fig : black2 ] .",
    "they originate from mixtures of the two initial wave packets of figure [ fig : black ] .",
    "therefore the created quanta appear in entangled pairs , one escaping , the other one falling into the singularity .",
    "this wave packet originates from waves with positive and negative frequencies .",
    "these waves are mixtures of the escaping waves of fig .",
    "[ fig : black ] traced backwards in time ; hence the escaping quanta and the in - falling quanta form entangled partners .",

    "the radiation of horizons has been regarded as a confirmation for black - hole thermodynamics @xcite and as a crucial test case for quantum theories of gravity such as superstring theory @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite .    however , near the event horizon , fields are subject to frequency shifts beyond the planck scale @xcite , as fig .  [",
    "fig : black ] schematically illustrates : the incident wave packets oscillate at significantly higher frequencies than the outgoing waves .",
    "the mechanism that could limit the frequency shifting at the horizon of the astrophysical black hole is unknown .",
    "hawking radiation may thus depend on as yet unknown physics or may not exist at all .",
    "there is no observational evidence for hawking radiation in astrophysics yet ; and it seems unlikely that there ever will be for practical reasons  radiation with characteristic thermal wavelengths in the order of the schwarzschild radius , a few km for solar - mass black holes , is obscured by the cm - waves of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "astrophysical black holes are too large for noticeable hawking radiation , but laboratory analogues @xcite of black holes offer valuable insights into the mechanism of radiating horizons .",
    "most analogues are based on a simple idea @xcite : black holes behave like moving fluids .",
    "consider waves with phase velocity @xmath2 in a medium of flow speed @xmath3 .",
    "if the magnitude of @xmath3 exceeds @xmath2 waves can no longer propagate upstream ; they are trapped beyond a horizon .",
    "the horizon creates wave - quanta @xcite , the analogue of hawking radiation @xcite , with an effective temperature that depends on the flow gradient at the horizon , the analogue @xcite of the surface gravity .",
    "the radiation is only noticeable if the temperature of the fluid lies below the effective hawking temperature .",
    "superfluids @xcite like helium-3 or ultracold quantum gases @xcite may form radiating horizons for their elementary excitations and so would moving optical media for photons @xcite .    on the other hand , at the heart of the hawking effect lies a classical process that can be demonstrated with classical fluids such as water : the generation of waves with negative frequencies .",
    "for this , one should reproduce the characteristic behavior of wave packets at horizons traced backwards in time illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : black ] .",
    "this is possible with a time - reversed black hole  a white - hole horizon  as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : white ] .",
    "the horizon of the white hole corresponds to the following analogy : imagine a fast river flowing out into the sea , getting slower .",
    "waves can not enter the river beyond the point where the flow speed exceeds the wave velocity ; beyond this point the river resembles an object that nothing can enter , the white hole .",
    "such wave blocking has been comprehensively studied in the fluid - mechanics literature @xcite , but to our knowledge the generation of negative - frequency waves has never been observed before .    .",
    "the time - reversed black hole is the white hole .",
    "the arrow indicates the direction of the moving medium that establishes a horizon for counter - propagating waves .",
    "[ fig : white],width=377 ]",
    "what are negative - frequency waves ? consider linear one - dimensional wave propagation in a moving medium : a wave with phase @xmath4 propagates in the @xmath5 direction against the flow @xmath3 .",
    "the phase evolves in time @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath0 denotes the wavenumber and @xmath8 the frequency in the laboratory frame .",
    "imagine we construct at each point @xmath5 a frame that is co - moving with the fluid . in the locally co - moving frames @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and so the phase evolves in terms of the co - moving coordinates as the integral of @xmath11 with @xmath12 equation ( [ eq : doppler ] ) simply describes the doppler effect",
    " waves are frequency - shifted due to the motion of the medium . in a locally co - moving frame",
    ", @xmath1 can only depend on the wavenumber @xmath0 and the properties of the medium , but not explicitly on the position : @xmath1 is a function @xmath13 that is given by the dispersion relation .",
    "the phase velocity @xmath2 is defined as @xmath14 , whereas the group velocity is @xmath15 what can we say about the dispersion relation in general ? in isotropic media , @xmath16 is an even function of @xmath0 , because waves should be able to propagate in positive and negative directions in the same way . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the medium moves in the negative direction ( from the right to the left ) . in this case , counter - propagating waves have positive phase velocities @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we take the branch of @xmath1 where @xmath14 is positive , _",
    "i.e. _ where @xmath2 is an odd function of @xmath0 that is positive for positive @xmath0 .",
    "we also assume that the counter - propagating waves move with positive group - velocities @xmath17 in the medium and that the group - velocity dispersion of the medium is normal , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 monotonically decreases for increasing @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : graphical ] shows our specific case that satisfies these general requirements .",
    "suppose that the laboratory frequency @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath0 is given by the doppler formula ( [ eq : doppler ] ) and the dispersion relation @xmath13 . in general , the solution of this equation is multi - valued : each frequency @xmath8 corresponds to several wavenumbers @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ to several physically allowed waves . as visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphical ] , the physically allowed waves are determined by the points @xmath0 where the line @xmath19 intersects the curve @xmath13 .",
    "one of these wavenumbers @xmath0 is always negative , as fig .",
    "[ fig : graphical ] illustrates . since @xmath1 is an odd function of @xmath0 , the co - moving frequency @xmath1 must be negative for negative @xmath0 , although the frequency @xmath8 in the laboratory frame is always positive .",
    "we call waves with negative co - moving frequencies _ negative - frequency waves_. imagine we display the wave propagation in a space - time diagram , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) the lines of constant phase @xmath4 have positive slopes @xmath20 for positive @xmath0 and negative slopes for negative @xmath0 .",

    "the wavenumber @xmath21 describes the incident wave , @xmath22 the blue - shifted and @xmath23 the hawking wave with negative wavenumber @xmath0 and negative frequency @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : graphical],width=434 ]    figure [ fig : graphical ] shows that for negative - frequency waves the slope of the curve @xmath13 is smaller than the slope of the doppler line , smaller than @xmath24 . as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : group ] ) the group velocity @xmath25 in the laboratory frame must be negative .",
    "therefore , negative - frequency waves can not be launched directly , but they can be the result of a mode conversion from incident positive - frequency waves .",
    "following a suggestion by schtzhold and unruh @xcite , we studied water waves in the channel schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "a ramp in the channel creates a gradient in flow speed .",
    "the flowing water forms a white - hole horizon , an object that waves can not enter , when the flow @xmath26 matches the group velocity @xmath27 of the waves . water waves  gravity waves  obey the dispersion relation @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the gravitational acceleration of the earth at the water surface and @xmath30 is the height of the channel . in the limit of long wavelengths , _",
    "i.e. _ small wavenumbers @xmath0 , the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) reduces to @xmath31 ; waves propagate with @xmath32 .",
    "we see from the doppler formula ( [ eq : doppler ] ) that , in this limit , @xmath1 is connected to @xmath8 and @xmath0 by a quadratic form , which defines a space - time geometry @xcite .",
    "a rigorous analysis @xcite proves that the propagation of water waves is exactly equivalent to wave propagation in space - time geometries , as long as @xmath18 is much smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "so , in our case , the channel height @xmath30 serves as a simple analogue of the planck scale ; waves with wavelengths shorter than @xmath30 do not experience the effective space - time geometry anymore .",
    "close to the horizon , the incident waves are compressed until @xmath0 reaches the scale of @xmath33 .    , width=453 ]    to characterize the waves , we use the graphical solution of the doppler formula ( [ eq : doppler ] ) combined with the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphical ] . for a given positive frequency @xmath8 , either one or three real solutions exist , one negative and possibly two positive @xmath0 . only in the case of a positive solution",
    "will the wave - maker launch waves , because the group velocity ( [ eq : group ] ) of the negative - frequency wave is negative .",
    "the slope of @xmath1 at the smallest positive @xmath0 is higher than the slope of the doppler line @xmath19 . for this wavenumber",
    "the group velocity is positive : this @xmath0 describes the incident wave .",
    "when the incident wave propagates against the rising current , the slope of the doppler line rises until the two positive @xmath0 merge . at this point , the flow matches the group velocity of the wave .",
    "the incident wave is converted into a short - wavelength wave ; it is blue - shifted below the effective planck scale @xmath30 .",
    "for the blue - shifted wave , @xmath27 lies below the flow speed @xmath26 : the blue - shifted wave drifts back with negative group velocity ( [ eq : group ] ) , but @xmath0 is positive and so is the frequency @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : graphical ] shows that such wave blocking @xcite can not occur below a critical flow speed . in order to estimate @xcite the critical @xmath3 we replace @xmath34 in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) by the asymptotic value of @xmath35 .",
    "a real @xmath0 ceases to exist when the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation vanishes , for @xmath36 .",
    "since the dispersion curve ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) lies below the asymptotics , this procedure @xcite gives an overestimation of the critical flow speed .",

    "we performed our experiment at acri , a private research company working on environmental fluid mechanics problems such as coastal engineering .",

    "a current can be superimposed in the same direction as the wave propagation or in the opposite one , with a maximum flow rate around @xmath43 . to generate a water - wave horizon",
    ", we insert a ramp immersed in water , with positive and negative slopes separated by a flat section ; and send on it a train of waves against the reverse fluid flow produced by the pump . at the place where the flow speed equals the group velocity of the waves a horizon is created .",
    "the geometrical parameters are : maximum water height @xmath44 or @xmath45 ; positive slope @xmath46 ; length of the flat part @xmath47 ; minimum water height @xmath42 or @xmath48 ; negative slope @xmath49 .",
    "we fix the physical characteristics of the waves , period and amplitude , and only vary the background flow .",
    "we record the waves with the three video cameras indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "as the background velocity is turbulent ( the reynolds number based on the water height is very large ) and varies with depth , the horizon should be deduced from the mean velocity @xmath50 measured at the interface between air and water ; the brackets denote time averaging .",
    "due to experimental constraints , we measured the background flow with a mhd sensor averaged during @xmath51 .",
    "the velocity profile on the flat part of the background flow is plug - like .",
    "our first control parameter is @xmath52 , the maximum of the counter - current plug velocity over the flat part of the geometric profile without water waves .",

    "[ fig : phasediagram],width=529 ]    in our experiments , we observed indications of wave conversion in the presence of horizons , but the cleanest data we obtained was for flow speeds just below the horizon condition . in this case , the wave conversion still occurs @xcite , although it is reduced in magnitude . without a group - velocity horizon ,",
    "the flow is much quieter , wave breaking and turbulence are significantly reduced .",
    "figure [ fig : spacetime ] shows the space - time diagrams of two typical cases , one illustrating the conversion into short waves with positive phase velocity , and the other showing waves with negative frequency superposed on the incident waves .    ,",
    "in order to test whether conversion into negative - frequency modes occurs even in the absence of a horizon , we applied unruh s method @xcite for numerically simulating waves in moving media .",
    "we consider wave packets propagating against the current in a simple one - dimensional model for the flow , using periodic boundary conditions , and analyse the mode conversion .",
    "this simulation does not describe the influence of turbulence , nonlinearity , the three - dimensional aspects of our experiment nor the variation of the flow with water depth , but it captures the qualitative aspects of the hawking effect and proves that the mode conversion can occur without a horizon , a regime where the experiment is least affected by wave breaking and turbulence .",
    "a related example of hawking radiation without horizon has been studied before @xcite that qualitatively agrees with our findings , although our case is significantly more extreme",

    "we believe we have made the first direct observation of the conversion of incident waves with positive frequency into negative - frequency waves in a moving medium . in astrophysics ,",
    "such a mode conversion occurs at the event horizon of black holes .",
    "it represents the classical mechanism at the heart of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "however , we were surprised how strong the experimentally observed mode conversion is , because in numerical simulations of a simple model @xcite we saw a significantly lower conversion .",
    "this model takes into account the correct dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersion ] ) , but it does not describe turbulence , nonlinearity , nor the three - dimensional nature of our experiment",
    ". it would be highly desirable to find out exactly what happens to water waves at horizons .",
    "unfortunately , with the current set - up we have not sufficient data to characterize the actual process of mode conversion in detail .",
    "it is conceivable that we have seen a new fluid - mechanics phenomenon that significantly enhances the hawking effect .",
    "could it be a nonlinear mode conversion , a nonlinear process generating harmonics with negative frequencies ?",
    "we observed that the incident waves become steeper as they propagate against the current .",
    "hence , locally , waves can be generated close to the crest , possibly with additional vorticity creation , where geometric cusps could develop through nonlinear effects .",
    "these crests waves are then swept away by the flow .",
    "moreover , it remains to be checked in future experiments whether a transverse curvature of the wave crest could also be responsible for the creation of negative - frequency waves . in any case , despite the limitations of our present experiment , we have found clear evidence for negative - frequency waves . in this way , we have demonstrated a key ingredient of the quantum radiation of black holes using a relatively simple classical laboratory analogue , waves in a water tank .",
