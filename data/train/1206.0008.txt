    "over the past years , observations and theory have been progressing significantly in understanding how the first large disk galaxies could form .",
    "near - infrared ( rest - frame optical ) imaging from the hst reveals that , while @xmath140% of z@xmath11 - 3 most massive ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) galaxies are relatively compact and quiescent , @xmath160% of them are actively forming stars and show quite extended stellar structures ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in a larger range of mass (",
    "i.e. , @xmath110@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 ) , @xcite suggested that the stellar phase of z@xmath11.5 - 3.6 galaxies is probably distributed as triaxial ellipsoids rather than thick disks .",
    "integral field spectroscopy now routinely provides us with spatially - resolved kinematics of the sub - population of z@xmath11 - 3 emission line galaxies @xcite . actively forming galaxies at these epochs reveal a relatively balanced mix of obvious ( major ) mergers , relatively compact dispersion - supported objects , and rotating extended structures , all being much more turbulent in their gaseous phase compared to local galaxies @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "cosmological simulations have predicted that streams of cold gas would occur in the halos in which these galaxies are expected to inhabit @xcite .",
    "such streams would be responsible for bringing a continuous amount of high angular momentum gas in these halos over a relatively short timescale @xcite . because the amount of mass brought that way",
    "is expected to be considerable , this could in principle pressurize the central forming disk and result in clump fragmentation @xcite , as ubiquitously observed at these epochs @xcite .",
    "such `` clumpy galaxies '' are now more and more considered as an important step of galaxy formation .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether the lifetime of such clumps is long enough to allow them to survive feedback effects and coalesce to form a central bulge @xcite .",
    "it remains also unclear how _ thin _ disks can form from the high angular momentum gas which is expected to be accreted into the halos . finally , the smoking gun detection of cold gas accretion is still missing , although different options are being extensively discussed @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it remains more uncertain how these z@xmath12 thick rotating disks evolved down to z@xmath10 , and how the local thin disks formed .",
    "indeed , the hubble sequence of galaxies such as the milky way ( @xmath5 ) reveals a predominance ( 72% ) of rotationally - supported disks in the present - day universe @xcite . using the cosmological principle , their progenitors at z@xmath10.6 , i.e. ,",
    "six billion years ago , can be selected and their morphology studied using the advanced camera for survey on - board the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "using methodologies and rest - frame luminosities that mimic those used for local galaxies , the likeliest ancestor of the hubble sequence can then be established @xcite .",
    "half the progenitors of spiral galaxies show peculiar morphologies that exclude them from this sequence @xcite .",
    "most of them are starbursts , whose emergence at z@xmath10.6 reflects that of emission line galaxies @xcite . as part of the images survey ,",
    "the large - scale spatially - resolved kinematics of a representative subsample of 63 emission line galaxies at z=[0.4 - 0.75 ] was obtained using the giraffe multi - ifu spectrograph @xcite .",
    "most peculiar galaxies also reveal peculiar large - scale motions @xcite . comparing the morpho - kinematic properties of the subsample of the 33 galaxies lying into the cdfs @xcite with those of a grid of simple major merger models ,",
    "convincing matches were found in about two - thirds of the cases @xcite .",
    "this leads to at least one third of the progenitors of present - day spirals potentially involved in a major merger .",
    "since major mergers can easily destroy thin rotating disks @xcite , this creates a critical tension between the large fraction of present - day disks and their survival within the @xmath0-cdm paradigm @xcite .    further investigating the `` disk survival issue '' requires an accurate estimation of the evolution of the merger rate , i.e. , the fraction of galaxy involved in mergers per unit time .",
    "several techniques were developed over the past years to try to quantify accurately the evolution of the merger rate , such as the pair technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the morphological technique , either through non - parametric ( e.g. , @xcite ) or visual ( e.g. , @xcite ) classifications .",
    "alternatively , the amplitude of the two - point correlation function can also be used to infer a merger rate @xcite .",
    "all these techniques are very dependent on the visibility timescale of the specific merging phase sampled by the observations , which requires to be estimated using additional numerical simulations and/or analytical arguments @xcite .",
    "accounting for the exact distributions of merger mass ratios or orbits involved is also challenging @xcite .",
    "as a result , observational estimates spread over almost one decade at z@xmath10 - 1 @xcite .",
    "recent progresses combine numerical simulations with transfer radiation to derive a weighted average visibility timescale for each observational technique , using predictions for the distribution of mass ratios and other merger parameters from galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "taking these aspects into account , the discrepancy between the different merger rates derived in the literature is significantly reduced , while remaining differences are attributed to differences in range of mass ratio and sample selection @xcite .",
    "this illustrates how crucial it is to carefully accounts for these aforementioned effects .",
    "the present study puts this effort one step forward : we show that by combining spatially - resolved morphological and kinematic data as those provided by the images survey , one can date back the epoch where observed galaxy mergers were still in pair , and then derive the evolution of the fraction of mergers out to z@xmath11.5 , in a consistent way as a function of redshift .",
    "such data also allow us to estimate relevant visibility timescales that are by construction consistent with the distribution of merger mass ratios and orbits of the galaxies in the observed sample .",
    "the derived evolution of the merger rate out to z@xmath11.5 is found to be within a factor 2 - 3 of theoretical predictions from a state - of - the - art @xmath0-cdm semi - empirical model .",

    "the near - infrared luminosity functions of the global population and of the blue sub - population of galaxies are very similar @xcite . at first order ,",
    "emission - line and blue galaxies sample the same population @xcite , which in principle guarantees that the images - cdfs sample is representative of the star forming population of galaxies at these epochs .",
    "the total sfr of all the 33 remaining galaxies in the images - cdfs sample was estimated as the sum of the unobscured sfr measured from the rest - frame uv luminosity at 2800@xmath16 combined to the dust - reprocessed contribution , which was estimated from the ir luminosity as measured using 24 @xmath17 m spitzer fluxes ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "detailed color morphology ( at a @xmath1500 pc resolution scale ) and large - scale kinematics ( at a @xmath17 kpc resolution scale ) were obtained thanks to the hubble space telescope , and 3d spectroscopy using the giraffe multi - ifu spectrograph , respectively .",
    "galaxies were classified independently according to their morphology @xcite and kinematics @xcite , based on similarities with the properties of local galaxies .",
    "the kinematical maps allowed us to classify the images - cdfs galaxies into three distinct kinematic classes ( see @xcite ) . rotating disks [ rds ] were those for which the velocity field [ vf ] showed an order gradient , a dynamical axis aligned with the morphological axis , and a velocity dispersion peak located at the dynamical center .",
    "for these objects , it was required that the sigma peak location and amplitude can be reproduced by modeling the velocity dispersion map from the velocity gradient observed in the vf . at the giraffe spatial resolution",
    ", it is indeed expected that most of the rotation curve gradient falls into on giraffe pixel , which results in an velocity dispersion peak at the dynamical center of the object .",
    "conversely , galaxies with complex kinematics [ cks ] were those for which no ordered gradient was observed in the vf , or when a significant misalignment between the kinematical rotation axis and the morphological principle axis was detected .",
    "perturbed rotators [ prs ] gathered objects with an order velocity gradient in the vf , but for which the velocity dispersion peak ( location and/or amplitude ) could not be reproduced from the vf , which indicates that this peak can not be attributed to rotation .",
    "this classification was tested against quantified criteria and considering all uncertainties associated to kinematic measurements , which makes it objective and reproducible , as described extensively in @xcite .",
    "the detailed color morphology of all the 33 galaxies in the images - cdfs sample was studied by @xcite . using a reproducible decision tree relying on parametric parameters and visual inspection of images and color maps ,",
    "galaxy morphologies were classified into six different classes : compact systems , mergers , peculiar/ possible mergers , peculiar tadpoles , peculiar irregulars , and spiral disks .",

    "this classification was done by three independent classifiers using a decision tree , which limits the subjectivity and makes it reproducible .",
    "the comparison between the morphological and kinematical classes show a very good agreement , with more than 80% of spiral disks having rotating disks , and more than 90% of peculiar galaxies having complex or perturbed kinematics .",
    "since perturbations in the ( ionized ) gaseous phase generally correspond to perturbations in the stellar phase , the result of both the morphological and kinematical classifications can be robustly synthesized into a morpho - kinematic classification @xcite . with this classification ,",
    "rotating spiral disks are those classified both as rotating disks from the kinematic point of view , and as spiral disks from the morphological point of view .",
    "non - relaxed systems are those that show a complex kinematics and a peculiar morphology .",
    "semi - relaxed systems are galaxies that show either some rotation from their kinematics ( being classified as either a rotating disk or either a perturbed rotation ) but with a peculiar morphology , or galaxies that do not show rotation in their kinematics ( being classified as having a complex kinematics ) but with a spiral disk morphology . according to this classification , 80% of z@xmath10.6 starburst galaxies",
    "are non - relaxed or semi - relaxed systems @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath150% of all intermediate - mass , z@xmath10.6 galaxies , since 60% of intermediate - mass , z@xmath10.6 galaxies are indeed starbursts @xcite .",

    "stellar kinematic disturbances are indubitable evidence for an out - of - equilibrium dynamical state . in high - redshift galaxies , deriving spatially - resolved stellar kinematics remains out of reach , and one has to rely on gas kinematics as a best proxy .",
    "this implicitly assumes that gas kinematics traces the gravitational potential , and that no other mechanisms are perturbing gaseous motions , such as , e.g. , outflows . in the images sample ,",
    "large - scale outflows have been detected in only a handful of cases @xcite . using fors2 slit spectroscopy , @xcite further estimated that only 8% of intermediate - mass galaxies at z@xmath10.6 have significant outflows .",
    "this suggests that gas kinematics is indeed a reliable tracer of the dynamical state of galaxies , at least on large spatial scales .",
    "several dynamical processes are known to be a source of kinematic disturbances .",
    "some of them are local in space , while others are global .",
    "relative to the equilibrium state of rotation ( as expected in the intermediate mass range since more massive galaxies are expected to reach a different equilibrium state supported by dispersion ) , local disturbances are either due to minor mergers or internal instabilities such as clump formation , while global disturbances can be due to major mergers or cosmological gas accretion @xcite .      in the images sample , kinematic perturbations are detected over a @xmath377 kpc spatial scale , which corresponds to the giraffe - ifu spatial resolution element ( i.e. , two spaxels ) .",
    "they generally affect the galaxies across a significant fraction of their diameter , which , in principle , excludes _ de facto _ any mechanism resulting in local kinematic disturbances . in order to quantify this , we derived the jeans scale length @xmath38 @xcite in the images - cdfs , which is found to be 0.7@xmath300.1 kpc .",

    "this confirms that even in the most disturbed clumpy galaxies , the kinematic perturbations can not be associated with the position of the clumps , i.e. , they are not local but global . in addition ,",
    "clump instabilities are limited to a fraction of 20% of intermediate - mass galaxies at z@xmath10.6 that are effectively clumpy @xcite , which also rules out clump instabilities as a driver for the strongest kinematic perturbations .    regarding minor mergers , such processes",
    "are also expected to lead to local kinematic perturbations only .",
    "an obvious case of minor merger with a mass ratio of @xmath11:18 was studied in detail by @xcite : only a local signature is found in the velocity dispersion map ( see top panel in fig . [ figgals ] ) .",
    "even if we can not exclude that in very specific cases such local processes could result in large kinematic disturbances such as those observed in images galaxies , we can safely conclude that they can not be the main driver for the majority of galaxies , at least for the ck galaxies .",
    "this does not mean that minor mergers are not ongoing in the images sample , but given the spatial resolution of giraffe - ifu data , they probably remain mostly undetected .          regarding the impact of processes resulting in global disturbances , it is instructive to consider the range of the relative variations of the gravitational potential ( compared to the dynamical equilibrium state ) @xmath39 , in which galaxies can be considered as isolated and subject to secular evolution , as a function of mass and redshift @xcite .",
    "we estimated @xmath39 for galaxies in the images - cdfs sample using rotation kinematic models @xcite .",
    "for this , we derived the pixel - by - pixel relative difference between the observed vf and each galaxy model , and considered the sum @xmath40 of this map over all pixels , weighted by the observed s / n in each pixel .",
    "the quantity 2.@xmath41 can then be used as a proxy for @xmath39 .",

    "uncertainties correspond to 1-@xmath31 error - bar , and were estimated using bootstrap resampling .    in this regime ( i.e. , @xmath4310 myr and @xmath441 ) , the two dominant physical processes expected to drive gravitational perturbations in this range of mass and redshifts are secular evolution ( i.e. , instabilities occurring in a galaxy ) and the direct dynamical evolution of individual substructures due to some previously initiated perturbation , which can eventually dominate the evolution of the whole system @xcite .",
    "large global perturbations ( i.e. , @xmath451 ) are typically triggered by major mergers .",
    "the characteristic timescale for secular evolution can be estimated using the circular disk period i.e. , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the disk radius and @xmath48 the circular velocity .",

    "such an assumption is consistent with semi - analytic models , which predict almost no evolution of the merger visibility timescale as a function of lookback time , at least within uncertainties @xcite .",
    "another possible caveat is the observed evolution of the galaxy gas fraction with redshift @xcite , which could potentially result in evolving timescales depending of the merging phase probed @xcite . however , hydrodynamical simulations of binary mergers @xcite predict that unequal mass ratio mergers ( which dominate the empirical distribution of merger mass ratios , see sect .",
    "3.2 ) generally show no evolution of the pair visibility timescale with gas fraction .            depending on whether or not the two progenitor candidates potentially involved in the merger could be identified visually in the hst / acs images ( e.g. , when two candidates for the progenitor nuclei could be identified ) , the secured major merger candidates were split into pre - fusion ( 8 gal . ) or post - fusion phases ( 10 gal . ) . amongst the objects that could not be secured as major merger candidates using numerical models , three were found to correspond to the pre - fusion phase , since they reveal distinct potential progenitors .",
    "they were therefore added to the pre - fusion phase .",
    "we attribute the fact that their numerical models did not succeed in reproducing their morpho - kinematical properties with sufficient precision to the limited exploration of the parameter space .",
    "the pre- and post - fusion phases as observed at z@xmath10.6 correspond to galaxies that were on average in pairs ( and before the first passage ) at earlier epochs .",
    "to date these epochs , we simply averaged the time elapsed since the beginning of the merger model for each of the 18 secured major merger candidates , and converted these numbers into a redshift .",
    "all numbers were weighted by the respective grade given to the different models .",

    "since 60% of intermediate - mass galaxies at z@xmath10.6 are emission - line galaxies @xcite , this translates into a total fraction of mergers of 10.0% and 18.1% for the pre- and post - fusion phases , respectively .",

    ", we found that the fraction of local galaxies that have undergone a major merger since z=2 decreases from 65% to 53% . within uncertainties , this matches quite well the maximal fraction of bulgeless galaxies found by @xcite in the same range of mass ( 57% ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no tension between the fraction of mergers inferred from morpho - kinematic data and the fraction of local bulgeless galaxies . in other words , there is no need for disks to `` survive '' major mergers in the @xmath0-cdm paradigm , at least at z@xmath152 .      _ the results of this paper point toward a re - building of half of local disks during the past 9.4 gyr after their last gas - rich major merger @xcite .",
    "_ this does not imply that the evolution of the star formation and stellar mass densities are primarily driven by such processes over the same period @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with recent developments of the @xmath0-cdm model at earlier lookback times ( i.e. , z@xmath201.5 ) , according to which galaxy formation would be mainly driven by streams of cold gas , rather than by major mergers @xcite .",
    "indeed , cosmological simulations predict that cold flows are strongly suppressed below z@xmath11 - 1.5 @xcite .",
    "such an epoch might correspond to a transition between two different mechanisms driving galaxy formation , i.e. , cold gas streams and gas - rich major mergers , as suggested by the strong evolution of the fraction and properties of clumpy galaxies as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "in such simulations , halos with a relatively quiet merger history are usually selected as the best probes for the formation of local thin disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the present results suggest that gas - rich major mergers could be be an equally plausible way of forming large thin disks .",
    "further work will be needed to quantify what is the main reservoir of gas from which such thin disks can reform .",
    "potential sources of gas include gas expelled during the merger and which falls back onto the remnant @xcite , gas coming from external gas accretion @xcite , and/or gas recycled through stellar feedback @xcite .",
    "this emphasizes the need to further explore how such disks can ( re-)form in halos with a more recently active merger history @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent cosmological simulations conducted with state - of - the - art hydrodynamical codes reveal cold gas disks that have larger extent and specific angular momentum compared to disks formed in former sph cosmologicial simulations @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that massive halos ( i.e. , @xmath139 ) have significantly larger sfrs at z=0 - 2 , compared to previous simulations @xcite .",
    "using morpho - kinematic data of z=[0.4 - 0.75 ] galaxies from the images - cdfs survey , we derived the evolution of the major merger rate out to z@xmath11.5 , i.e. , nine billion years ago . using comparisons of the spatially - resolved morpho - kinematic properties between observations and a grid of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers ,",
    "we constrain their time evolution , which allowed us to accurately date back when they were still in pair .",
    "we then compared constrains from observations with predictions from semi - empirical models .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "morpho - kinematic observations are found to be sensitive to all the phase of the merger process , from the pre - fusion phase in which galaxy nuclei are still separable by visual inspection , to the post - fusion and relaxation phases , in which the two progenitors merge and progressively reach equilibrium .",
    "each of the three phases are found to last @xmath11.8 gyr .",
    "the major merger rate ( defined as baryonic mass ratio @xmath200.25 ) inferred from morpho - kinematic observations is found to be evolving from 5.5%.gyr@xmath81 to 11.1%.gyr@xmath81 between z=0.72 to z=1.55 in the range of stellar mass 10@xmath140 - 10@xmath141m@xmath18 ( diet salpeter imf ) , or 10@xmath142 - 10@xmath141m@xmath18 in baryonic mass .",
    "3 .   a remarkable agreement is found between observational estimates and predictions from the @xcite semi - empirical model , which accounts for the specificity of gas - rich mergers at high redshifts .",
    "the agreement is found to be at a level of a factor 2 - 3 without any particular fine - tuning of the model , accounting for both random and systematic uncertainties on the observational and theoretical sides , which significantly improves the accuracy of previous comparisons .",
    "the @xmath0-cdm model predicts , in agreement with observations , that 33% of z@xmath10.6 intermediate - mass galaxies are on - going major mergers .",
    "observational signatures of these mergers encompass morpho - kinematic disturbances in a large fraction of these galaxies at this redshift , and an increase of the scatter of scaling relations between mass , velocity and radius ( or angular momentum ) .",
    "the @xmath0-cdm model predicts , in agreement with observations , that 20% / 50% / 65% of local galaxies in the range of stellar mass 10@xmath127 - 10@xmath128m@xmath18 were involved in a major merger between z=0.6 / 1.5 / z=2.0 and z=0 .",
    "most of the major mergers occurring between z=0.6 and z=0 were probably relatively dry , resulting in galaxies with a prominent bulge , while most of the major mergers occurring between z=1.5 and z=0.6 probably involved large gas fractions , which should lead to the rebuilding of a significant disk .",
    "theoretical models often suggest that `` bulgeless galaxies '' ( b / t@xmath150.2 ) result from relatively quiet merger histories .",
    "we found no tension between the fraction of local bulgeless galaxies and the fraction of local galaxies that have undergone a major merger since z=2 , i.e. , there seems to be no `` disk survival issue '' but rather a `` disk rebuilding '' era , at least at z@xmath151.5 - 2 , when the influence of cosmological gas accretion predicted by theory and simulations would start declining in relatively massive haloes .",

    "we estimated the fraction of each morphological type in local galaxies as follows .",
    "we first considered morphologically determined luminosity functions ( mdlf ) of local galaxies from @xcite .",
    "they indeed constructed lfs for e / s0 , s0/a - sb , sbc - sd , and i m galaxies using @xmath11500 galaxies from the sdss using the r band luminosity .",
    "we first converted their observed r band luminosity into stellar mass using prescriptions from @xcite , which gives a mean stellar mass / r - band luminosity ratio in the local volume of 3.05 within @xmath3030% of systematic uncertainty ( diet salpeter imf ) .",
    "we then integrated each of the mdlf ( once converted into the proper imf ) from 10@xmath127 to 10@xmath128m@xmath18 , within which the descendants of the on - going z@xmath10.6 major mergers should end up , as predicted by the hod model ( see sect .",
    "this results in the fractions of morphological types as listed in tab . [ types ] . deriving the fraction of morphological type that way",
    "has the advantage of avoiding systematics associated with the representativity of the sample , and is limited only by the statistical scatter associated with the visual classification of @xcite and the systematic uncertainty associated to the mean stellar mass - to - light ratio in the local volume as determined by @xcite .    as a consistency check",
    ", we also derived the fraction of morphological types in the local universe using the catalogue of @xmath114000 visually classified galaxies in the sdss from @xcite .",
    "we selected in their catalogue galaxies in the range of mass 10@xmath127 - 10@xmath128m@xmath18 , and with redshift @xmath143 0.05 .",

    "@xcite emphasized that such a cut in @xmath88 will remove some of the brightest , most massive galaxies in the local volume , but these galaxies are all above the range of mass of interest , so this will not impact the morphological fractions in this range .",

    "there are some variations within the fractions of early - type spirals , probably reflecting the uncertainty associated to eyeball classification between s0 and s0a galaxies .",
    "the second interesting feature is the smaller fraction of e / s0 found by @xcite in conjunction with their higher fraction of peculiar galaxies compared to other catalogues .",
    "this was attributed by @xcite to a number a factors that include ( 1 ) their systematic use of color maps to identify unusual color gradients , ( 2 ) the quantification of the misalignment between bulge and disk centroids , and ( 3 ) the compactness of galaxies , which were moved to the peculiar class if too compact to be decomposed into bulge and disk .",
    "galaxies harboring such features were classified as peculiar by @xcite , but are probably in the e / s0 class in other catalogues that do not take into account such an information .",
    "this suggests that @xmath110% of the e / s0 classified by @xcite or @xcite are actually perturbed and not fully relaxed .",

    "leads to a fraction of late - type galaxies @xmath133% ( above m@xmath19=10@xmath135m@xmath18 ) . since spirals account for @xmath170% of local galaxies ( tab .",

    "@xcite used exactly the same classification method and strictly equivalent data to classify local and distant galaxies , which minimizes systematics when comparing the two epochs . when one uses the same method , it is found that the fraction of fully relaxed e / s0 does not evolve between z@xmath10.6 and z=0 .",

    "<S> about two - thirds of present - day , large galaxies are spirals such as the milky way or andromeda , but the way their thin rotating disks formed remains uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> observations have revealed that half of their progenitors , six billion years ago , had peculiar morphologies and/or kinematics , which exclude them from the hubble sequence . </S>",
    "<S> major mergers , i.e. , fusions between galaxies of similar mass , are found to be the likeliest driver for such strong peculiarities . however , thin disks are fragile and easily destroyed by such violent collisions , which creates a critical tension between the observed fraction of thin disks and their survival within the @xmath0-cdm paradigm . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed high occurrence of mergers amongst their progenitors is only apparent and is resolved when using morpho - kinematic observations which are sensitive to all the phases of the merging process . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an original way of narrowing down observational estimates of the galaxy merger rate and leads to a perfect match with predictions by state - of - the - art @xmath0-cdm semi - empirical models with no particular fine - tuning needed . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that half of local thin disks do not survive but are actually rebuilt after a gas - rich major merger occurring in the past nine billion years , i.e. , two - thirds of the lifetime of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this emphasizes the need to study how thin disks can form in halos with a more active merger history than previously considered , and to investigate what is the origin of the gas reservoir from which local disks would reform . </S>"
