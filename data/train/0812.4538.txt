    "protein - deoxyribonucleic acid(dna ) interaction plays an important role in a large number of cellular processes such as gene expression , suppression , replication , transcription , recombination , repair and in several other processes @xcite .",
    "dna participation in the above processes are mediated or catalyzed by dna - binding proteins like polymerases , helicases , nucleases , isomerases , ligases and histones .",
    "usually cellular processes start with the binding of a protein ( enzyme ) to the dna .",
    "for example , the transcription process starts with the binding of rna - polymerase ( an enzyme protein ) with a promoter site of the dna and this binding is known to change the conformation of dna by opening the bases . the above conformation change or base pair opening stresses the relevance of dynamics in understanding protein - dna interaction .",
    "experimentally , these conformational changes in dna during protein - dna interaction have been studied through atomic force microscopy @xcite , dynamic spectroscopy @xcite , x - ray crystallography of protein - dna co - crystal @xcite , nmr studies @xcite and electrophoresis experiments @xcite as well as through fluorescent measurements @xcite .",
    "results from free energy calculations combined with molecular dynamics simulations also explain the base flipping through protein - dna interaction @xcite",
    ". however , from a theoretical point of view , the understanding of protein - dna interaction and its dynamics is still in its infancy .",
    "this is because the individual dynamics of dna and protein itself is a very complex one .",
    "also , interaction of the dna molecule with the surrounding viscous medium and thermal fluctuations add to the complexity .",
    "the knowledge of the dna dynamics through soliton - like excitations describe base pair opening or base flipping during dna functions . in this direction , englander et al @xcite ,",
    "used soliton excitations to explain base pair opening in dna for the first time .",
    "yomosa @xcite proposed a plane base rotator model by taking into account the rotational motion of bases in a plane normal to the helical axis , and then takeno and homma @xcite generalized the same and the nonlinear molecular excitations were shown to be governed by kink - antikink solitons .",
    "in contrast to the above , peyrard and bishop @xcite and christiansen and his collegues @xcite proposed a model by taking into account the transverse and longitudinal motions of bases in dna to describe the base pair opening through breather .",
    "later , several authors@xcite including the present authors @xcite suggested that either kink soliton or breather would be a good candidate to play a basic role in base pair opening in dna .",
    "in all the above studies , the dynamics of dna molecular system has been studied without taking into account thermal fluctuations and viscosity of the surrounding medium and hence , it was shown that , the soliton representing the base pair opening in dna may travel for infinite distance and time .",
    "recently , few authors studied the effect of thermal fluctuations @xcite and viscosity of the surrounding medium on unzipping and soliton - like base - pair opening and showed that these effects damp the solitons and hence travel only for a limited distance @xcite . like dna dynamics , the dynamics of protein through soliton excitations also plays an important role in describing energy transfer in alpha helix proteins . in this",
    "regard , davydov @xcite who for the first time used soliton excitations to explain energy transfer in alpha helical proteins by proposing a new model by considering the coupling between the quantum transition occurring due to the vibrational structure of the @xmath0 bond and the elastic longitudinal wave propagation along the chain with the helix behaving like a spring .",
    "later on , the above study was extended by several authors @xcite including one of the present authors @xcite to study the effect of exchange excitation between the chains , temperature , higher order interactions and interspine coupling .",
    "in contrast to davydov s model , yomosa @xcite and very recently sataric et al @xcite studied soliton excitations in protein by considering the molecule as a toda lattice chain .",
    "the recent results on the statistical mechanics of protein - dna system through coarse - grain and worm - like chain models describe unzipping of the dna chain @xcite .",
    "normally , protein molecule interacts with dna either through non - specific interaction ( sequence - independent ) which is mainly driven by the electrostatic attractive force between positively charged amino acids and negatively charged phosphate groups of the dna back bone or through specific interactions ( sequence - dependent ) including hydrogen bonds , van der waals force and water mediated bonds between the protein molecule and specific site of dna @xcite . in a recent paper , sataric et al @xcite studied the impact of regulatory proteins through hydrogen bonds on breather excitations in dna by considering davydov model of amide - i vibration for protein dynamics and peyrard - bishop s model of stretching of hydrogen bonds for dna dynamics and found that binding of protein to dna gives rise to a large - amplitude breather . except the above",
    ", no author has so far studied the impact of protein on the dynamics of dna . hence , in the present paper , we study the conformational changes that take place in the form of base pair opening in dna through nonlinear excitations induced by a protein molecule through interaction at the physiological temperature in a viscous surrounding medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present details of the above model and the hamiltonian for the dna molecular chain .",
    "the model hamiltonian for protein - dna interaction is given in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we derive the equation of motion for the protein - dna molecular system in the continuum limit and in the next section ( section v ) base pair opening in dna as soliton solution of the associated nonlinear dynamical equation in a non - viscous medium is shown .",
    "the effect of viscosity of the surrounding medium on the base pair opening in dna is understood through perturbation analysis in section vi .",
    "the results are concluded in section vii .",
    "we consider a dna double helix in b - form along with a protein molecule ( say rna - polymerase ) at physiological temperature in a surrounding viscous medium and study the impact of protein interaction on the dynamics of dna .",
    "the model we propose here for the study treats dna as a set of two coupled linear molecular chains and protein as a single linear chain interacting through a linear coupling . a schematic representation of the above protein - dna molecular system is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the figure @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "represent the two complementary strands in the dna double helix .",
    "each arrow represents the direction of the base attached to the strands and the dots between arrows represent the net hydrogen bonding effect between the complementary bases .",
    "the shaded ellipse overlapping the dna double helical structure represents interaction of protein with the dna molecule .",
    "the conformation and stability of dna double helix is mainly determined by the stacking of bases through intrastrand dipole - dipole interaction and through hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases ( interstrand interaction ) . from a heuristic argument",
    ", it was assumed that the hydrogen bonding energy between the complementary bases depends on the distance between them .",
    "generally , the distance between the complementary bases can be expressed through longitudinal , transverse and rotational motion of bases . among the different motions , the rotational motion of bases",
    "is found to contribute more towards the opening of bases pairs .",
    "hence , for our study , we consider a plane - base rotator model for dna @xcite which the authors have extensively used for studying pure dna dynamics in the recent times @xcite . in order to find the distance between the complementary bases , in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) , horizontal projections of the @xmath3 base pair in the xy and xz - planes are presented respectively . in the figure ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the tip of the @xmath3 bases belonging to the complementary strands @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the angles of rotation of the bases in the @xmath3 base pair in the xz and xy - planes respectively .    by using simple geometry in figs .",
    "1(b , c ) , we can write the distance between the tips of bases as @xcite @xmath10 + 2\\left[\\sin\\theta_n\\sin\\theta'_n \\left(\\cos\\phi_n\\right.\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.\\times\\cos\\phi'_n+\\sin\\phi_n\\sin\\phi'_n\\right ) \\left.-\\cos\\theta_n\\cos\\theta'_n\\right],\\label{eq1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ` @xmath11 ' is the radius of the circle depicted in fig .",
    "+ the hydrogen bonding energy can be understood in a more clear and transparent way by introducing quasi - spin operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 . using the above , eq.([eq1a ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath14\\nonumber\\\\ & & -4r\\left[s_n^{x}+s_n^{'x}\\right].\\label{eq1b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while writing eq.([eq1b ] ) , we have chosen @xmath15 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the form of @xmath16 given in eq.([eq1b ] ) is the same as the hamiltonian for a generalized form of the heisenberg spin model .",
    "therefore , the intrastrand base - base interaction in dna also can be written using the same consideration . also , it is reasonable to think that if such a quasi - spin model can be used in this problem , the double strand dna and the rung - like base pairs can be conceived as a coupled spin chain model or a spin ladder system .    with the above consideration , we are at liberty to use the following heisenberg model of the hamiltonian for a coupled spin chain model or spin ladder system with ferromagnetic - type exchange interaction between nearest neighbouring spins in the same lattice ( equivalent to stacking of bases in one strand i.e. intrastrand interaction ) and ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic rung - coupling ( equivalent to hydrogen bonds between complementary bases i.e. interstrand interaction ) .",
    "@xmath17.\\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the dna double helical chain is mapped onto a two coupled spin chain model or a spin ladder system with ferromagnetic legs ( @xmath18 ) and ferromagnetic ( @xmath19 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath20 ) rungs .",
    "therefore , in hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) , the terms proportional to @xmath21 correspond to stacking interaction between the @xmath3 base and its nearest neighbours in the two strands and the last term which is proportional to @xmath22 corresponds to the interstrand interaction or hydrogen bond energy between the complementary bases . in equilibrium , the parameter @xmath22 is expected to be less than zero ( corresponding to antiferromagnetic coupling ) .",
    "+ as dna works at the biological temperature , the hydrogen atom attached to the bases are also normally in a thermally excited state .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to generalize the above model into a thermal dna .",
    "thus , to include the effect of thermal phonons into the system , we add the following hamiltonian .    @xmath23,\\label{eq2a}\\\\ h_{d - t}&=&\\alpha_1 \\sum_n   ( x_{n+1}-x_{n-1})({\\bf s_n\\cdot s'_n}),\\label{eq2b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , with overdot representing the time derivative and @xmath25 represents the elastic constant .",
    "@xmath26 is the mass of the hydrogen atom attached to the base and @xmath27 represents the displacement of it at the @xmath3 site along the direction of the hydrogen bond .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath28 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2b ] ) represents the coupling between the vibration of the above hydrogen atom ( thermal fluctuation ) and the rotation of bases .",
    "as protein binding to dna induces large mechanical stress on it , which causes conformational changes , and thus acts as a precursor for all the functions of dna .",
    "hence , we investigate here the dynamics of a dna when a protein molecule interacts with it by sliding on the dna chain .",
    "eventhough , proteins are much larger in size than the dna(substrate ) , only a small portion of the protein molecule , namely the active site is directly interacting with the dna molecule ( see fig.1 ( a ) ) . hence , we consider the short active site region of the protein molecule that interacts with the dna as a linear chain as has been treated by several other authors ( see for e.g. sataric et al @xcite ) . thus ,",
    "as said earlier , we propose the model for the above protein - dna molecular system by considering dna as a set of two coupled linear chains and the active site region of the protein molecule as a linear molecular chain interacting with the bases which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "the dna part of the sketch is the linearized chains of fig .",
    "1(a ) and @xmath29 represent the @xmath3 and @xmath30 sites representing the bases ( similar to @xmath31 in figs .",
    "1(b , c ) ) .",
    "@xmath32 represents the linear protein molecular chain ( active site region ) interacting with the bases by sliding on the dna chains . to explain the model for the above system further",
    ", we consider the protein molecule as a collection of mass points , with each mass point representing a peptide unit and connected by linear springs exhibiting longitudinal stretching motion parallel to the helical axis of dna , i.e. along z - direction which couples to the hydrogen bonds of bases in a linear way .",
    "hence , the model hamiltonians for the longitudinal stretching motion of the protein molecule ( @xmath33 ) and its interaction with the dna chain ( @xmath34 ) is written as    @xmath35,\\label{eq3a}\\\\ h_{d - p}&=&\\alpha_2 \\sum_n   ( y_{n+1}-y_{n-1})s_n^z s_n^{'z},\\label{eq3b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the mass of the peptide .",
    "@xmath38 denotes displacement of the @xmath3 peptide in the protein chain from its equilibrium position and @xmath39 represents the elastic constant associated with the small amplitude oscillation of the protein molecule .    the interaction hamiltonian @xmath34 given in eq.([eq3b ] ) is chosen to represent the change in hydrogen bonding energy due to change in the distance between the adjacent peptide units along the hydrogen bonding spines of the protein molecule and @xmath40 is the coupling coefficient .",
    "further , as the protein molecule is assumed to slide on the dna chain , the interaction energy along z - direction is expected to be dominant over the energy in the xy - plane normal to it ( see eq.([eq3b ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the total hamiltonian for our model can be written using eqs .",

    "when the viscosity is low , the soliton will travel for some time .",
    "similar results have also been observed by yakushevich @xcite through numerical analysis .",
    "they showed that when the viscosity is low , the soliton passes more than 3000 chain links in dna like a heavy brownian particle and when the viscosity is large , the soliton stops after a few chain links .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the nonlinear dynamics of a protein - dna molecular system under thermal fluctuations in a viscous surrounding medium by considering dna as a set of two coupled linear chains and protein as a single linear molecular chain interacting through linear coupling . in the non - viscous limit ,",
    "the dynamical equation for the system is derived from the hamiltonian through a semiclassical approach using glauber s coherent state method combined with holstein - primakoff ( h - p ) bosonic representation under continuum approximation .",
    "the equation of motion reduces to a set of coupled equations in which the equation for dna dynamics is a nonlinear equation for rotation of bases and inhomogeneous wave equations representing vibration of hydrogen atom in the bases and for the protein molecule . in the linear limit ,",
    "the above equations are decoupled and reduced to time - dependent schrdinger equation for a free particle and one - dimensional homogeneous linear wave equations . while the former one admits dispersive plane transverse wave solution the later ones give non - dispersive wave solutions .",
    "when protein molecule and thermal phonons started interacting with the dna , the coupling introduces nonlinearity into the dynamics of bases in dna , and the set of coupled equations of motion reduce to the completely integrable nonlinear schrdinger equation that admits n - soliton solutions . during interaction the energy of the excited dna molecule increases and",
    "the nonlinearity localizes the energy thus forming localized solitons .",
    "the solitons represent opening of base pairs in both the strands which collectively form a bubble travelling along the dna double helical chain at physiological temperature .",
    "thus , the protein molecule acts as a zip runner that opens the base pairs which close when the protein molecule progress along the dna chain . for , strong coupling , the amplitude of the soliton is expected to decrease . on the other hand , the dynamics of the system in the viscous medium",
    "is governed by a perturbed nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the effect of viscosity is understood by carrying out a multiple scale perturbation analysis .",
    "the results show that while the amplitude of the soliton decreases and the velocity remains constant as time progresses .",
    "the soliton , damps out quickly in the case of high viscosity and moves for some time when the viscosity of the surrounding medium is low .",
    "the events that happen in the present study may represent the binding of an rna - polymerase to a promoter site in the dna during the transcription process .",
    "our results have very strong coincidence with the experimental data @xcite that the binding of rna - polymerase to the promoter site in dna is accompanied by a local distorsion of the dna bases in the form of solitons which can propagate along the dna double helix . in nature",
    ", protein binds to dna in a very specific site like promoter , coding or terminator which has a specific sequence of bases and this makes the strands site - dependent or inhomogeneous .",
    "hence , it is important to understand the nonlinear dynamics of inhomogeneous dna with the protein bound to specific site of dna and the study is under progress .",
