    "in the last 25 years the existence problem for the static einstein - vlasov system has been studied intensively .",
    "several works have established the existence of mainly static but also of stationary solutions modeling ensembles of self - gravitating collisionless massive particles in equilibrium .",
    "the results include spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat , globally regular solutions with energy density of compact support @xcite , solutions with black holes @xcite , axially symmetric static  @xcite and stationary solutions  @xcite , and static solutions of several types for non - vanishing cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "these works have in common that they consider the case of massive particles and thereby primarily provide models for large scale objects such as galaxies or galaxy clusters .    by setting the rest mass in the einstein - vlasov system to zero",
    "one obtains the corresponding massless system , which describes an ensemble of uncharged self - gravitating massless particles , e.g.  photons .",
    "the cauchy problem for the massless einstein - vlasov system has been studied for small spherically symmetric perturbations of minkowski space by dafermos @xcite .",
    "recently numerical evidence for the existence of static solutions to this system was given by akbarian and choptuik @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to prove that a class of static solutions to the massless einstein - vlasov system indeed exists .",
    "the results presented in this paper may also be considered in the wider context of the theory of static solutions to the einstein equations . for the vacuum einstein - equations and the einstein - maxwell equations classical rigidity theorems",
    "imply that the only regular , asymptotically flat , static solution is minkowski space . due to this ,",
    "the construction of models for isolated self - gravitating objects resorts to other types of matter coupled to the einstein equations .",
    "while classical matter models such as fluids , massive collisionless particles , and elastic matter are primarily used for describing macroscopic objects , one motivation for considering field theoretical equations is to construct models for elementary particles - so called _ particle - like solutions_. in 1955 wheeler introduced the concept of _ geons _ which are singularity free solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations , cf .",
    "also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "his main purpose was to construct solutions which describe effectively a localized particle - like object without introducing mass or charge into the system - the expressions _",
    "mass without mass _ and _ charge without charge _ originate from  @xcite . in order to obtain tractable equations wheeler considered the case of , what he called , _",
    "idealized spherically symmetric geons_. these solutions are spherically symmetric only on time average . in wheeler s treatment the details of the electromagnetic field",
    "are thus replaced by the time average of the components of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor .",
    "the resulting equations are solved numerically , cf .",
    "@xcite , and a thin shell of self - gravitating electromagnetic radiation is obtained for which the ratio @xmath4 is close to @xmath1 , where @xmath5 is the adm mass and @xmath3 is the area radius . in fact , wheeler s numerical solution is closely related to the result we prove in this work . indeed , if the massless particles are photons , the solutions we construct describe thin photon shells . as in wheeler",
    "s study the ratio @xmath4 of the shells is close to @xmath1 also in our case .",
    "we point out that necessarily @xmath6 for any static solution of the einstein - vlasov system , cf .",
    "@xcite . this bound also applies in wheeler s case since the form of the energy momentum tensor for the maxwell field studied in  @xcite satisfies the assumptions in  @xcite . in conclusion , the massless einstein - vlasov system and",
    "the einstein - maxwell system may in this case be considered as two different mathematical models describing the same physical phenomena , where the former is a particle model and the latter is a field theoretical model .",
    "more recently , the existence of a different type of particle - like solutions has been established , i.e. , regular spherically symmetric static solutions of the einstein - yang - mills system .",
    "numerical evidence for their existence was first found by bartnik and mckinnon @xcite .",
    "eventually , a rigorous proof was obtained by smoller et al .",
    "it is important to point out that all particle - like solutions discussed above are likely unstable , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , for the massive einstein - vlasov system several results on existence of static spherically symmetric solutions are available that cover classes of different generality .",
    "an essential part in these proofs is to show that the matter quantities are compactly supported .",
    "this is clearly a necessary condition for modeling isolated objects .",
    "the majority of the existing proofs work indirectly and rely on the asymptotic behavior of the metric , and they have in common that they show the _ existence _ of a radius that bounds the support of the matter .",
    "the value of which however remains undetermined .",
    "for the massless einstein - vlasov system the situation is different . in section [ proofs ]",
    "we introduce what we call the _ characteristic function _",
    "@xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is defined in , @xmath9 is the particle mass , and @xmath10 is a fixed constant .",
    "this function has the property that if and only if @xmath11 all matter quantities vanish at this radius @xmath3 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_yp ] ) implies that @xmath8 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath3 .",
    "consider now the massive case with @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the logarithm in ( [ gamma_pre ] ) is positive for all @xmath3 and it is known @xcite that there exists a radius @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "hence @xmath11 for all @xmath15 . in the massless case",
    "however , when @xmath16 , the term containing the logarithm behaves completely differently .",
    "assume now that there is a radius @xmath17 such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20 and as long as @xmath21 , @xmath8 is given by the schwarzschild component ( [ yss ] ) and we have @xmath22-\\frac 1 2 \\ln\\left[\\frac{l_0}{r^2}\\right].\\ ] ] in view of @xcite we have @xmath23 .",
    "so we see that @xmath24 becomes positive again at some radius and matter reappears .",
    "in particular there exists no radius @xmath13 such that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior resembles an infinitely extended thin atmosphere of massless vlasov matter .    in this work",
    "we use the approach in  @xcite which shows the existence of static spherically symmetric arbitrarily thin shell solutions of the massive einstein - vlasov system .",
    "more precisely , in  @xcite it is shown that the matter quantities are supported in an interval @xmath27 $ ] , where the ratio @xmath28 can be made as close to 1 as desired .",
    "the motivation for the study  @xcite was to show that the inequality @xmath29 can be arbitrarily well saturated by solutions to the massive einstein - vlasov system .",
    "in fact , thin shell solutions correspond to highly relativistic solutions for which the ratio @xmath0 is close to @xmath1 . in order to show that the interval of support @xmath27 $ ] has the property that @xmath28 is close to 1 it is of course necessary to obtain detailed control of the radius @xmath17 , which is the smallest radius greater than @xmath30 for which the matter quantities vanish .",
    "when such a radius has been established the ansatz for the matter distribution can be dropped and the matter quantities are set to zero for @xmath31 .",
    "the metric in this -now infinitely extended- vacuum region is the schwarzschild metric with a mass parameter corresponding to the mass of the enclosed matter shell . in this way a pure matter shell is obtained .",
    "we remark that if the solution in the massive case is not continued by a schwarzschild solution at @xmath32 , other types of solutions can be constructed , e.g. solutions which contain several shells separated by vacuum regions or separated by thin atmospheres , cf .",
    "these solutions are nevertheless asymptotically flat , i.e. , there exists a radius @xmath33 such that the matter quantities vanish for @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , in the massive case the ratio @xmath4 does not have to be close to its upper bound @xmath1 but can be small .",
    "thus static solutions of the massive einstein - vlasov system with matter quantities of bounded support do not have to be highly relativistic .    in this work",
    "we modify the method in  @xcite to the massless case and obtain solutions supported in an interval @xmath27 $ ] such that the solutions agree with the schwarzschild solution for @xmath31 .",
    "as was outlined above , it is here necessary to continue the solution with a schwarzschild solution at a radius where the matter quantities become zero since the solution given globally by an ansatz of the form ( [ ansf ] ) is not asymptotically flat .      a crucial condition for proving the existence of a radius @xmath17 , where the matter quantities vanish , is that the there is a radius , called @xmath35 , such that the ratio @xmath36 .",
    "hence the solutions we construct are highly relativistic .",
    "it is an important question to decide whether or not this is a necessary condition for the existence of static photon shells .",
    "the answer to this question is essential for the physical interpretation of the solution .",
    "we conclude the paper by providing numerical evidence for the following conjecture .",
    "[ our_con ]",
    "let @xmath2 be the hawking mass of a solution of the massless einstein - vlasov system given in ( [ def_m ] ) and @xmath37 be the areal radius .",
    "then a necessary condition for the existence of massless , asymptotically flat solutions is @xmath38    in particular , we conjecture that the photon shells are necessarily highly relativistic .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    "we introduce the massless einstein - vlasov system in spherical symmetry and review known results that this work relies on .",
    "in section [ sec_theorem ] we state our main result , and section [ proofs ] is devoted to its proof .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_numerics ] , we solve the equations numerically to investigate which conditions on the parameters are _ necessary _ for the existence of photon shells .",

    "for a given space - time @xmath39 , the mass - shell of massless particles is defined to be @xmath40 in general the particle rest mass @xmath9 is given by the expression @xmath41 .",
    "so this relation constitutes the essential difference to the massive system .",
    "we consider the static , massless einstein - vlasov system in spherical symmetry .",

    "the peak is enclosed by two vacuum regions .",
    "note that the energy density is not zero for large radii even though it is very small .",
    "however , not all solutions show matter regions that are separated by vacuum , as for example the solution depicted in figure [ shell2 ] .        in conjecture [ our_con ]",
    "the quantity @xmath344 was introduced .",
    "our numerical calculations indicate that @xmath345 is a necessary condition for that a solution with separated matter regions as in figure [ shell1 ] occurs .",
    "there are four parameters that determine a solution of the einstein - vlasov system if the matter distribution function is chosen to be of the form ( [ ansf ] ) .",
    "these parameters are the initial value @xmath95 for the metric component and the constants @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath10 in the ansatz ( [ ansf ] ) .",
    "we observe that this parameter space is separated by a hypersurface into a region where matter shells occur and a region where the support of the matter quantities is connected .",

    "the qualitative behavior however -including the observation that all shells have @xmath345- does not change .",
