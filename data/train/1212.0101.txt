    "classical information - theoretic cryptography , when we need to send a private message to a receiver in the presence of wiretappers , in order to protect the message , we encrypt the message with a random key and send the ciphertext to the receiver .  a wiretapper who has no access to the key can know nothing about the message by only observing the ciphertext , in the sense that the ciphertext and the message are statistically independent .",
    "on the other hand , the receiver obtains the key via a `` secure '' channel and use it to decrypt the ciphertext to recover the private message .",
    "the best known such model is the one - time pad system studied by shannon @xcite , which requires the minimal amount of randomness for the key .",
    "the one - time pad system was generalized to _ secret sharing _ by blakley @xcite and shamir @xcite .",
    "ozarow and wyner @xcite also studied a similar problem which they called the _ wiretap channel  ii_. in this model , information is sent to the receiver through a number of point - to - point channels .",
    "it is assumed that the wiretapper can access any one but not more than one set of channels , called a wiretap set , out of a collection @xmath10 of all possible wiretap sets , where @xmath10 is specified by the problem under consideration .",
    "for example , @xmath10 could be the collection of all wiretap sets each containing a single channel . in this case",
    ", the wiretapper can access any one but not more than one channel .",
    "the strategy to protect the private message is the same as that in classical information - theoretic cryptography .",
    "specifically , the private message and the random key are combined by means of a coding scheme , so that a wiretapper observes some mixtures of the message and the key , where these mixtures are statistically independent of the message . on the other hand",
    ", the receiver node can decode the message from the information received on all the channels .",
    "note that in secret sharing and its subsequent generalizations , it is assumed that the key is available only to the transmitter and transmission in all the channels is noiseless .",
    "cai and yeung @xcite generalized secret sharing to secure network coding , in which a private message is sent to possibly more than one receiver through a network of point - to - point channels .",
    "the model they studied , which we refer to as the _ wiretap network _",
    "( see also el rouayheb and soljanin @xcite ) , is described as follows . in this model ,",
    "the assumptions about the wiretapper and the strategy to protect the private message are the same as in the wiretap channel ii .",
    "the significant difference is that there exist intermediate nodes in the network that can encode , and there may be more than one receiver node .",
    "the solution is that we send both the private message and the key via a network coding scheme , so that a wiretapper can only observe some mixtures of the message and the key , where the mixtures are statistically independent of the message . on the other hand",
    ", a receiver node can recover the private message by decoding the information received from its input channels .",

    "_ @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "a condition for the existence of secure linear network codes was proved and a construction of such codes was proposed .",

    "el rouayheb and soljanin regarded the secure network coding problem as a network generalization of the model in wiretap channel ii and showed that the transmitted information can be secured by using the coset coding scheme in @xcite at the source on top of the existing network code . moreover",
    ", their code is equivalent to the code in @xcite but the required alphabet size is much smaller .",
    "the optimal code constructions in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have a common strategy : they first construct a code on the message and the key at the source node and then transmit the source code via a network code , which depends on the code at the source node . in cai & yeung @xcite and zhang & yeung @xcite ,",
    "a general security condition for multi - source network code was presented .",
    "the performance of a secure network coding scheme is measured by two quantities : the size of the message and the size of the key . in designing a secure network coding scheme ,",
    "we want to maximize the size of the message and at the same time minimize the size of the key .",
    "the latter is necessary because in cryptography , randomness is regarded as a resource . in @xcite , when the collection @xmath10 of all wiretap sets consists of all subsets of channels whose sizes are at most some constant @xmath6 , an upper bound on the size of the message and a lower bound on the size of the random key were obtained .",
    "both of these bounds are tight for this special case . in this paper",

    "a polynomial - time algorithm was proposed to construct the strongly @xmath6-secure linear network code .",
