    "the observation that ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , defined as those with infrared luminosities greater than @xmath8 @xmath9 ) show a mixture of two distinct types of nuclear activities , namely starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , has led to many observational studies of their formation and evolution processes ( e.g. , sanders et al .",

    "( 1988 ) proposed that ulirgs formed by gas - rich galaxy mergers can finally evolve into qsos after the removal of dust surrounding qso black holes .",
    "spectroscopic properties of ulirgs have been extensively discussed in terms of the relative importance of starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in the energy budget of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these observations have so far raised many questions , the most significant being : ( 1 ) whether all ulirgs evolve into qsos , ( 2 ) what mechanisms are responsible for triggering starbursts and agn obscured heavily by dust in ulirgs , ( 3 ) what determines the relative importance of starbursts and agn in spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ulirgs , ( 4 ) whether there is an evolutionary link between starbursts and agn in ulirgs , and ( 5 ) whether there can be physical relationships between low redshift ( low-@xmath10 ) ulirgs and high-@xmath10 dust - enshrouded starbursts and agn at intermediate and high redshifts recently revealed by scuba ( submillimeter common - user bolometer array ) ( e.g. , barger et al .",

    "morphological studies of ulirgs revealed that they show strongly disturbed morphologies indicative of violent galaxy interaction and merging .",
    "previous theoretical studies have tried to answer the above five questions in the context of gas fuelling to the central region of galaxy mergers ( see shlosman et al .",
    "1990 for more general discussions on fuelling mechanism in galaxies ) .",
    "physical mechanisms responsible for the formation of starbursts in galaxy mergers have been investigated by many authors ( e.g. , olson & kwan 1990 ; barnes & hernquist 1991 ; noguchi 1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; gerritsen & icke 1997 ) .",
    "for example , olson & kwan ( 1990 ) suggested that high velocity disruptive cloud - cloud collisions , which are more prominently enhanced in mergers , are responsible for the observed high star formation rates in galaxy mergers .",
    "although these previous numerical studies provided some theoretical predictions on star formation rates ( sfrs ) and their dependence on the initial physical parameters of galaxy merging ( e.g. , bulge - to - disk - ratio and gas mass fraction ) , they did not investigate both sfrs and accretion rates ( ars ) onto the central super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) simultaneously .",
    "therefore , they did not provide useful theoretical predictions on the formation and evolution of agn , or on a possible evolutionary link between starbursts and agn in ulirgs .",
    "physical processes of gas fuelling to the central smbhs in galaxy mergers have been investigated by a number of authors ( bekki & noguchi 1994 ; bekki 1995 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2005 ; springel et al .",
    "2005a , b ) . using dynamical simulations with rather idealized",
    "modeling of gas dynamics and star formation , bekki & noguchi ( 1994 ) first investigated both sfrs and ars in merging galaxies and found that sfrs become very high at the epoch of the coalescence of the cores of two merging galaxies , whereas ars attain their maxima only after the coalescence .",
    "recently , springel et al ( 2005a ) have performed more sophisticated , high - resolution sph simulations including feedback effects of agn on the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and thereby demonstrated that agn feedback can be quite important for global photometric properties of elliptical galaxies formed by major galaxy merging .",
    "these previous models however did not discuss the latest observational results of ulirgs , partly because their model do not allow authors to investigate photometric and spectroscopic properties of dusty starbursts and agns in galaxy mergers .",
    "the purpose of this paper is thus to investigate simultaneously both sfrs and ars of merging galaxies in an self - consistent manner and thereby try to address the aforementioned questions related to the origin of ulirgs .",
    "we particularly try to understand ( 1 ) physical conditions required for galaxy mergers to evolve into ulirg with agn ( or starbursts ) , ( 2 ) key factors which determine the relative importance of starbursts and agn , and ( 3 ) epochs when mergers become ulirgs with agn .",
    "we develop a new model in which the physics of star formation ( including gas consumption and supernovae feedback by star formation ) , the time evolution of accretion disks around smbhs , and the growth of smbhs via gas accretion from the accretion disks are included . by using this new model ,",
    "we show ( 1 ) how sfrs and ars in merging galaxies evolve with time , ( 2 ) how they depend on galactic masses , mass ratios of two merging spirals , and bulge - to - disk - ratios of the merger progenitor spirals , and ( 3 ) how smbhs grow in the central regions of starbursting mergers .",
    "we also show emission line properties of galaxies with starbursts and agns by combining the results of the simulated sfrs and ars with spectral evolution codes .",
    "although previous numerical simulations combined with spectrophotometric synthesis codes have already derived seds of _ purely starburst _ galaxies obscured by dust ( bekki et al .",
    "1999 ; bekki & shioya 2000 , 20001 ; jonsson et al .",
    "2005 ) , they did not discuss at all the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies _ where starbursts and agn coexist_. therefore our new way of deriving spectral properties based on simulation results enables us to answer some key questions raised by recent large , systematic survey of agn ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 2003 ) , such as why a significant fraction of high - luminosity agn have the balmer absorption lines .",
    "previous one - zone spectroscopic models discussed what controls emission and absorption line properties of galaxies with starbursts and agn ( baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; kewley et al .",
    "2001 ; dopita et al .",
    "the present simulations allow us to discuss this point based on the results of sfrs and ars derived by chemodynamical simulations with growth of smbhs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we describe our numerical model for calculating sfrs and ars in merging galaxies . in  3 , we present the numerical results on the time evolution of sfrs and ars and its dependences of model parameters . in this section ,",
    "we also show emission line properties of galaxies mergers with starbursts and agn .",

    "the progenitor disk galaxies that take part in a merger are taken to have a dark halo , a bulge , and a thin exponential disk .",
    "their total mass and size are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . from now on , all masses are measured in units of @xmath11 and distances in units of @xmath12 , unless otherwise specified . velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath13 = @xmath14 and @xmath15 = @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 in the present study . if we adopt @xmath11 = 6.0 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath12 = 17.5kpc as fiducial values , then @xmath13 = 1.21 @xmath18 @xmath21kms@xmath3 and @xmath15 = 1.41 @xmath18 @xmath22 yr .",
    "we adopt the density distribution of the nfw halo ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) suggested from cdm simulations : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are the spherical radius , the characteristic density of a dark halo , and the scale length of the halo , respectively .",
    "the dark matter distribution is truncated at @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath28 in the nfw .",
    "the value of @xmath26 ( 0.8 ) is chosen such that the rotation curve of the disk is reasonably consistent with observations .",
    "the bulge has a density profile with a shallow cusp ( hernquist 1990 ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the scale length of the bulge .",
    "the ratio of a bulge mass ( @xmath31 ) to a disk mass ( @xmath11 ) in a disk is regarded as a free parameter and represented as @xmath5 .",
    "we determine the bulge scale length , @xmath30 , for a given @xmath31 based on the faber - jackson relation ( faber & jackson 1976 ) and the virial theorem .",
    "the bulge mass and its compactness can control the bar formation in the disks and thus the strength of starbursts in mergers . the bulge contains a smbh with the mass ( @xmath32 ) following the observed relation ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) ; @xmath33 the model for the time evolution of @xmath32 is described later .",
    "the dark matter to disk mass ratio is fixed at 9 whereas the bulge to disk ratio is assumed to be a free parameter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the radial ( @xmath34 ) and vertical ( @xmath35 ) density profiles of the disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath36 with scale length @xmath37 = 0.2 and to @xmath38 with scale length @xmath39 = 0.04 in our units , respectively .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity attributable to the gravitational field of the disk and halo components , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions are added to the disk component in accordance with the epicyclic theory , and with a toomre parameter value of @xmath40 = 1.5 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . the vertical velocity dispersion at a given radius",
    "is set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point , as is consistent with the trend observed in the milky way ( e.g. , wielen 1977 ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath37 to @xmath41 and that of @xmath26 to @xmath37 are fixed at 0.2 and 4.0 , respectively , for all disk models with different @xmath11 . since we adopt the scaling relation of @xmath42 ( kauffmann et al .",

    "the normalization factor @xmath46 is determined such that @xmath47 kpc for @xmath11 = 6.0 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 .",

    ".      the disk is composed both of gas and stars , with the gas mass fraction ( @xmath48 ) being a free parameter and the gas disk represented by a collection of discrete gas clouds that follow the observed mass - size relationship ( larson 1981 ) .",
    "all overlapping pairs of gas clouds are made to collide with the same restitution coefficient of 0.5 ( hausman & roberts 1984 ) .",
    "the gas is converted solely into field stars : we do not consider the formation of globular clusters ( gcs ) . field star formation is modeled by converting the collisional gas particles into collisionless new stellar particles according to the algorithm of star formation described below .",
    "we adopt the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with exponent @xmath49 = 1.5 ( 1.0 @xmath50 @xmath49 @xmath50 2.0 , kennicutt 1998 ) as the controlling parameter of the rate of star formation .",
    "the amount of gas consumed by star formation for each gas particle in each time step is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the gas density around each gas particle .",

    "these field stars formed from gas are called `` new stars '' ( or `` young stars '' ) whereas stars initially within a disk are called `` old stars '' throughout this paper .",
    "the adopted star formation model is similar to that with @xmath55 in bekki & shioya ( 1998 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) demonstrated that the total amount of energy that supernovae can give to the ism ranges from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ergs with a typical case being @xmath65 ergs .",
    "this amount is roughly 10 % of the total amount of energy of type ii sn and 20 % of type i ( thornton et al . 1998 ) .",
    "they also found that most of the energy of supernovae can be in the form of kinetic energy within the ism .",
    "guided by these previous theoretical results , we assume that 10% of supernovae energy can be converted into kinematical energy of gas clouds .",
    "we adopt the salpeter imf with the lower mass cut off of @xmath66 , the upper one of @xmath67 and the exponent of the slope equal to @xmath68 ( i.e.  a canonical imf ) .",
    "total number of supernovae at each time step can be calculated according to the star formation rate .",
    "the more details of the numerical method to give kinematical energy of supernovae to gas clouds are given in bekki & shioya ( 1999 ) .",
    "agn activity is believed to originate from sub - parsec size regions at the galactic nuclei , powered by the mass accretion onto smbhs through accretion disks ( e.g. , rees 1984 ) . in the present study",
    ", we assume that smbhs are not surrounded by accretion disks in initial disks and thus the accretion disks are assumed to form during merging .",
    "therefore , we need to model ( 1 ) formation processes of accretion disks around smbhs and ( 2 ) time evolution of ars in growing accretion disks in order to estimate ars in an self - consistent manner .",
    "although numerous theoretical studies have already been made for physical properties of static accretion disks ( e.g. , frank , king & raine 2002 ) , there have been no extensive theoretical studies on ars in accretion disks that are _ forming and growing _ through radial gas inflow into the central sub - parsec - scale region of galaxies from their outer parts .",
    "furthermore only a few theoretical attempts have been made to elucidate the formation process of gaseous tori and accretion disks around smbhs ( e.g. , bekki 2000 ) .    given this lack of theoretical detail on the evolution of accretion disks , we adopt the following two - fold model to calculate ars .",
    "for each time step of a simulation , we first calculate total gas mass that can be used for the formation of an accretion disk around a smbh in the central region of a galaxy by assuming that tidal interaction between the smbh and its nearby gas clouds and the resultant destruction of gas clouds ( bekki 2000 ) can be responsible for gas supply to the accretion disk .",
    "then , by using a reasonable analytical model , we calculate the time evolution of the ar ( @xmath69 ) onto the smbh for a given mass of the accretion disk at each time step .",
    "the details of this two - fold model are described as follows .",
    "the mass of an accretion disk around a smbh is assumed to increase as a result of gas accretion from gas clouds being gravitationally trapped and destroyed by the smbh ( bekki 2000 ) .",
    "we estimate the total mass of an accretion disk ( @xmath70 ) around a smbh based on gas densities of gas clouds within @xmath71 from the smbh .",
    "we assume that gas clouds within @xmath71 can be used as fuel for an accretion disk .",
    "bekki & noguchi ( 1994 ) adopted @xmath72 as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath32 is the mass of the smbh and @xmath74 is the velocity dispersion ( or any characteristic velocity ) in the background components , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "this @xmath72 can be estimated to be @xmath75pc for @xmath76 in a canonical set of galaxy parameters ( bekki & noguchi 1994 ) .    since our model for @xmath70 evolution",
    "is based on interaction between smbhs and gas clouds , we adopt the `` bondi '' radius ( @xmath77 ) rather than @xmath72 as @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath77 is described as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is relative velocity between the smbh and gas .",
    "we assume that @xmath79 is equivalent to the central velocity dispersion of a bulge in each model .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 is initially determined by the bulge mass of @xmath31 ( @xmath80 ) in a model owing to the adopted relation of @xmath81 relation .",
    "next we estimate total mass of gas clouds within @xmath71 and thereby derive a local gas density ( @xmath82 ) around a smbh .",
    "guided by theoretical predictions by hoyle & lyttleton ( 1941 ) , bondi ( 1952 ) , and ruffert & arnett ( 1994 ) , we calculate the accretion disk from gas clouds ( @xmath83 ) as follows : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is linearly proportional to @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath85 is therefore chosen according to @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( and hence @xmath11 and @xmath5 ) in each model .",
    "time evolution of @xmath70 is determined by solving the following equation in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath0 : @xmath88 @xmath0 represents the mass accretion rate onto a smbh and we describe the way to estimate @xmath0 later . equation ( 9 ) thus means that if there is no supply of gas from outer part of a galaxy into the nuclear accretion disk , @xmath70 gradually decreases owing to consumption of gas within the disk .",
    "based on @xmath70 , we estimate ar ( @xmath0 ) at each time step in a simulation . we adopt a gas - pressure dominated standard @xmath89-disk with the conversion rate of accreted mass to energy(@xmath90 ) equal to 0.1 and follow the relation between @xmath70 and @xmath0 for a given @xmath32 shown in liu ( 2004 ) :",

    "@xmath32 is time - dependent and its evolution is described as : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the time step width ( corresponding to @xmath97 ) in a simulation .",
    "we consider that 10% of the rest mass of accreted gas ( i.e.  @xmath98 ) can be converted into energy ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "although some fraction of @xmath99 may well be used for thermally and dynamically heating the ism in galaxy mergers , it is unclear what fraction ( @xmath100 ) of @xmath99 can be returned back to the ism through agn feedback effects .",
    "accordingly , we compromise by assuming that @xmath101 , the same value as that derived for supernovae feedback effects ( thornton et al .",

    "the agn feedback energy from a smbh is assumed to be used for the increase of kinetic energy of gas particles around the smbh .",

    "the methods to give a velocity perturbation ( directed radially away from the smbh ) to each gas particle around the smbh are the same as those for stellar feedback effects in bekki & shioya ( 1999 ) .",

    "the time @xmath143 represents the time that has elapsed since the simulation starts .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the time evolution of morphological properties , sfrs , and ars simultaneously for the galaxy merger in the standard model .",
    "the sfr can be moderately high ( @xmath144 ) at @xmath145 gyr when two disks can be still clearly seen as separate entities , whereas the ar becomes very high ( @xmath146 ) at @xmath147 gyr when two disks finally merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy .",
    "a disturbed outer morphology can be still seen at @xmath148 and 2.56 gyr when the ar becomes lower ( i.e.  weak agn phases ) .",
    "both the sfr and the ar become significantly low at @xmath149 and 3.38 gyr when the merger remnant can be morphologically identified as an elliptical with no peculiar fine structures ( e.g. , shells and plumes ) .    as figure 2 reveals , showing the time evolution of sfr and ar in the standard model m1 , both sfr and ar can be maximised when the two smbhs become close to each other .",
    "this is essentially because efficient radial transfer of gas into the central @xmath150pc in the merger occurs during the coalescence of the two big bulges .",
    "the ar exceeds the @xmath151 required for qso activity ( @xmath152 ) at @xmath153 gyr whereas the sfr does not exceed the @xmath154 required to produce a qso luminosity .",
    "therefore , this merger can be regarded as a qso dominated by activities induced by accretion power of smbhs .",
    "the epoch of maximum ar nearly coincides with that of maximum sfr , and this coincidence can be seen in most of the present models .",
    "these results imply that ( 1 ) galaxy mergers with agn activity can contain starburst components , and ( 2 ) starburst components in the merger would not be so easily detected owing to the overwhelming light from the agn . since morphological transformation from spirals into an elliptical is nearly finished at the epoch of the maximum ar in this model , the merger can be regarded as a forming elliptical with starburst and agn components .    as a natural result of the high ars in the galactic nuclei , the ratio of bolometric luminosity from the agn ( @xmath127 ) and that from the starburst ( @xmath128 ) becomes very large in the final phase of galaxy merging .",
    "figure 3 shows that ( 1 ) @xmath155 becomes higher as @xmath127 becomes higher , ( 2 ) it becomes more than 100 at the epoch of maximum @xmath127 , and ( 3 ) it is higher during and after the coalescence of two disk galaxies than before .",
    "these results suggest that the central starburst component in a merger can be more difficult to detect when the ar of the merger becomes higher .",
    "they also suggest that young elliptical galaxies formed by major galaxy merging are more likely to show spectra with agn features than hii region features .",
    "we will discuss this point in  4.1 .",
    "a key factor in the evolution of these systems is the presence of feedback from the agn . if we construct a model that has gas consumption by smbhs , but without agn feedback , we find that the maximum @xmath156 and @xmath0 are increased by factors of 2.8 and 113.0 respectively compared to model m1 ( which has the feedback present ) .",
    "this model also shows a higher residual star formation rate ( @xmath157 ) in a sporadic way even after coalescence of two cores in galaxy merging .",
    "it is therefore clear from these results that ( 1 ) agn feedback can suppress both ( i ) gas fueling to smbhs and ( ii ) nuclear starbursts and ( 2 ) agn feedback can strongly suppress residual star formation after coalescence of two cores .",
    "springel et al . (",
    "2005b ) have already pointed out that agn feedback can expel the remaining gas from merger remnants to shut off star formation in their sophisticated models of agn feedback .",
    "the self - control of the growth of the smbh by agn feedback effects may be important for better understanding the origin of the magorrian relation ( eg .",

    "figure 4 shows the time evolution of @xmath32 initially within bulges of the two merging disks .",
    "both smbhs grow quickly by a significant factor owing to efficient gas fuelling to the central @xmath150 pc and the resultant formation of massive accretion disks around them when star formation rates are quite high ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the difference in the growth rates shown in figure 2 is due to the fact that gas fuelling in the less inclined disk galaxy ( i.e.  galaxy 1 ) is more efficient than in the more inclined one ( i.e.  galaxy 2 ) .",

    "@xmath183 of the agn component is always significantly larger than that of the starburst one after the coalescence of the two bulges : owing to very minor , sporadic star formation after galaxy merging , @xmath183 of the merger remnant is dominated by the weak agn component .",
    "figure 9 clearly demonstrates that the emission line ratio of /h@xmath7 of the merger changes from the value typical for starbursts into that typical for agn at @xmath185 gyr .",

    "these results are consistent with the derived sfrs and ars ( e.g. , figures 2 and 3 ) , furthermore demonstrating the capability of our new codes in correctly predicting spectroscopic properties of galaxy mergers with a coexistence of starbursts and agn .",

    "we illustrate here the derived dependences and some physical correlations between sfrs and ars in galaxy mergers .",
    "figure 11 shows how the relative importance of starbursts and agn in galactic nuclei of galaxy mergers depends on the masses of the progenitor disks . for two sets of models with different bulge - to - disk - ratio ( @xmath5 = 0.1 and 0.5 )",
    ", @xmath190 is larger for larger @xmath11 , which means that more massive galaxy mergers are likely to be dominated by agn rather than by starbursts .",
    "this is essentially because the interstellar gas that is radially transferred from outer parts of mergers can be consumed more by smbhs than by starbursts owing to the larger initial masses of smbhs ( i.e.   @xmath191 ) in more massive mergers .",
    "we discuss this result later (  4 ) in the context of the origin of ulirgs .",
    "figure 12 shows that maximum sfr and ars in galaxy mergers with larger gas mass fraction ( @xmath48 ) are both higher compared to those with smaller gas mass fraction .",
    "this is because the total amount of gas transfered to the vicinity of smbhs is larger for the mergers with larger @xmath48 owing to a larger amount of gaseous dissipation in these .",
    "figure 12 also shows that mergers with @xmath192 exhibit ars much smaller than the @xmath135 required for qso activity .",
    "these results suggest that @xmath48 is one of key parameters that determine whether galaxy mergers show qso activity in their nuclei .",
    "irrespective of @xmath48 , the epoch of maximum sfr and that of maximum ar are nearly coincide with each other , which implies that coexistence of starbursts and agn can be quite common phenomena in galaxy mergers .",
    "figure 13 describes the time evolution of sfrs and ars for the two extreme cases of mergers with @xmath193 ( nearly bulge - less spiral progenitor ) and @xmath194 ( early - type m31-like spiral progenitor ) .",
    "it is clear from this figure that maximum accretion rates at the epoch of maximum sfrs are quite different to each other in these two cases : maximum @xmath0 is @xmath195 for @xmath194 and @xmath196 for @xmath193 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial @xmath32 can determine ars in the present model for the formation and the growth of accretion disks .",
    "figure 13 also shows that there is little difference in the maximum sfr between the two models .",
    "this result suggests that @xmath5 is also a key parameter which can determine whether galactic nuclei of mergers can be dominated by starbursts or agn .",
    "the accretion radius ( @xmath77 ) within which gas clouds can be converted into accretion disks is initially small for small smbhs in the model ( m19 ) with @xmath193 , owing to the adopted assumption of @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , gas clouds have to lose a larger amount of angular momentum ( with respect to smbhs ) to reach @xmath77 during merging . as a result",
    ", gas is consumed by star formation rather than by the growth of accretion disks around smbhs .",
    "thus , the ar is significantly smaller compared with other major merger models with bigger bulges .",
    "it should however be stressed here that if we relax the assumption of @xmath197 , the ar in the model m19 can also reach high values .    thus it should be stressed that it depends on the models of accretion radius ( @xmath77 dependent on @xmath32 or not ) whether initially small mbhs ( with masses of @xmath198 in the models with small @xmath5 ) can grow to become smbhs ( with masses of @xmath198 ) .",
    "although both previous models ( e.g. , springel et al . 2005b ) and the present one assume a relation between @xmath77 and @xmath32 , it is not so clear ( theoretically ) whether there really exists such a relation around smbhs in galaxies .",
    "it would be therefore safe to say that future very high - resolution numerical simulations , in which a @xmath199 relation is more self - consistently determined from sub - pc scale gas dynamics around smbhs , will provide a more robust prediction on this matter .",
    "both maximum sfrs and ars depend strongly on @xmath142 such that they are higher in mergers with larger @xmath142 ( see the 7th and 8th columns of the table 1 for the models m1 , m13 , and m14 ) .",
    "this is because a larger amount of interstellar gas can be driven into the central regions of galaxy mergers owing to stronger tidal disturbance and the resultant larger amount of shock dissipation in mergers with larger @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath0 in minor ( m13 ) and unequal - mass ( m14 ) mergers are well below @xmath200 , so that these merger remnants do not show qso activity and thus may well be identified as low luminosity agn . since these minor and unequal - mass mergers ultimately become s0s whereas major mergers can become es ( bekki 1998 ) , s0s are more likely to show low luminosity agn activity .",
    "these results also imply that there can be a correlation between agn host morphological types ( e.g , es or s0s ) and nonthermal luminosities of agn .",
    "the hsb minor merger model ( m15 ) shows a significantly high ar ( @xmath201 ) compared with the lsb counterpart m13 ( @xmath202 ) , which suggests that the compactness of the smaller galaxy in a minor merger is a key factor for gas fuelling to the central smbhs .",
    "the reason for this high ar is that the smaller galaxy of the hsb model can not be destroyed by the larger galaxy until the final coalescence of the two galaxies so that it tidally disturbs the ism of the larger galaxy more strongly and for a longer time and thus triggers more efficient gas fuelling .",
    "no significant dependences of time evolution of sfrs and ars on orbital configurations are found for a given set of parameters ( see the 7th and 8th columns of table 1 for the models , m1 , m10 , m11 , and m12 ) .",
    "typical sfrs and ars are of the order of @xmath203 and @xmath200 respectively , in these major merger models . given the derived @xmath141 dependences ,",
    "these results suggest major merging ( @xmath204 ) is one of requisite conditions for qso formation .",
    "both sfrs and ars can be significantly enhanced in tidal interaction models , however the degree of the enhancement is much less remarkable compared with major merger models .",
    "major merger models with bigger bulges ( i.e.  larger @xmath5 ) can show larger ars , whereas tidal interaction models with bigger bulges do not show high ars ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "this is because formation of strong stellar bars , which are the main drivers for gas fuelling to starbursts and agn , can not be formed in the bigger bulge models ( e.g. , @xmath206 ) .",
    "thus , tidal interaction models show high ars only when they involve smaller bulges and larger disk masses .",
    "figure  14 shows the 2d distribution of @xmath207 in the tidal interaction model m22 , with @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 at the epoch of its maximum ar ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "although we have investigated several representative tidal interaction models , only this tidal model with more massive smbhs shows a sufficiently high ar ( @xmath212 ) to become a qso .",
    "it is clear from figure  14 that interacting galaxies with qso activity can be identified as two galaxies .",
    "this is quite different from major merger models in which a merger with a qso activity almost always shows a single elliptical morphology .",
    "given the very limited range of parameters for tidal interaction models to show qso activities , these results imply that , if they are formed by galaxy interaction and merging , ( 1 ) most of qso hosts can be elliptical galaxies and ( 2 ) binary qsos can be very rare .",
    "this is borne out by observational results .",
    "mortlock et al . ( 1999 ) found only 16 binary qsos , and calculated an `` activation radius '' of between 50 and 100  kpc ( cf .",
    "figure  14 ) .",
    "assuming these were formed in a galaxy - galaxy collision , this implies that qso formation occurs late in the collision process .",
    "a more recent survey of binary qsos from the sloan digital sky survey and 2df quasar redshift survey ( hennawi et al .",
    "2005 ) found 218 quasar pairs with separations @xmath213 , implying a binary fraction of @xmath214 in 1000 .",
    "figure 15 shows that ( 1 ) there is a weak yet positive correlation between maximum sfrs ( @xmath215 ) and maximum ars ( @xmath216 ) and ( 2 ) there is a clearer correlation between @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the above result ( 1 ) suggests that mergers with more pronounced starburst activities are likely to show more pronounced agn ones .",
    "the result ( 2 ) suggests that mergers with more pronounced agn activities are more likely to be dominated by agn rather than starbursts .",
    "it should be however stressed here that if we plot @xmath1 and @xmath0 from data at every time step of all models ( including non - agn and non - starburst phases ) in the same way as shown in figure 10 , the derived two correlations becomes rather weak .",
    "thus the correlations can be held only for mergers with strong starbursts and agn .",
    "our numerical simulations have shown that galactic mass is a key factor in determining whether a forming early - type galaxy is dominated by starbursts or agn .",
    "the present study has demonstrated that the bolometric luminosity ratio , @xmath218 , is larger for galaxy mergers with larger initial disk masses ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "an order of magnitude estimation can allow us to understand this result . for global galactic star formation , we adopt the schmidt law , in which @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the surface gas density of a disk .",
    "we also adopted the @xmath221 relation ( kauffman et al .",
    "2003b ) in the present study .",
    "therefore @xmath222 can be approximated as : @xmath223 for @xmath224 in the present models with radially constant gas mass fraction .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath127 can be approximated as : @xmath225 for a given bulge - to - disk - ratio ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "equation 16 and 17 lead us to derive the following relation : @xmath226 this relation suggests that more luminous forming early - type galaxies via galaxy merging are likely to be dominated by agn rather than by starbursts , if merger progenitor disks contain a sufficient amount of gas for fuelling .",
    "although the above analytically derived relation of @xmath227 is qualitatively consistent with the simulations shown in in figure 11 , it is significantly shallower than those derived in the simulations ( @xmath228 for @xmath229 and @xmath230 for @xmath206 ; see figure 11 ) .",
    "the origin of this difference might well be closely associated with the fact that suppression of star formation from agn feedback ( which can enhance the relative importance of accretion - power - induced activity in galactic nuclei ) is not explicitly considered in the above analytical arguments .",
    "it is currently less feasible to prove the above mass dependence based on the comparison between the simulation results and observations , because most of previous observations focused on correlations between nuclear activities and the hubble morphological types ( e.g. , mouri & taniguchi 2004 ) .",

    "it has been a longstanding , remarkable problem what dominate the luminosities of ulirgs since many observational studies with different wavelengths revealed possible evidences for both starbursts and agn in ulirgs ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ; lutz et al .",

    "2004 ; goto et al . 2003 ) and by 8m - class ground telescopes with multi - object spectrograph ( e.g. , pracey et al .",
    "spectral signatures of poststarburst stellar populations in some qsos ( e.g. , canalizo & stockton 2000 ; 2001 ) and in some ulirgs ( e.g. , poggianti & wu 2000 ; goto 2005 ) imply that there could be some close physical relationships between ulirgs , qsos , and e+a s . in the following discussion ,",
    "qsos with poststarburst spectra ( i.e.  strong balmer absorption lines ) are referred to as `` q+a s '' just for convenience .",
    "the present simulations have demonstrated that smbhs of galaxy mergers can be surrounded by circumnuclear , compact , and young poststarburst populations when ars onto smbhs are high .",
    "this result implies that if the balmer absorption lines are not significantly diluted by balmer emission lines from agns , spectral signatures of poststarburst populations can be detected in galaxy mergers .",
    "based on these numerical results , we suggest the following two different evolutionary paths between mergers ( mer ) and ellipticals ( es ) . for sb - dominated ulirgs that are formed by merging either between less luminous disks or between disks with smaller bulges , strong balmer absorption lines can be detectable owing to less significant dilution of the absorption lines by emission lines from weaker agn components . therefore the evolutionary path could be ;    @xmath234    for agn - dominated ulirgs that are formed by merging between more massive disks with prominent bulges , the evolutionary path could depend on whether the lifetimes of qsos are shorter than the lifetimes of a - type stars .",
    "the present simulations have shown that the lifetime of qsos ( defined as the duration within which @xmath0 is higher than 0.7 @xmath54 ) is an order of @xmath235 gyr ( see hopkins et al .",
    "2005 for possible luminosity dependent qso lifetimes ) .",
    "the dilution of the balmer absorption lines by agn emission can be significant in the very strong agn phases so that the absorption lines can not be detected so easily .",
    "the absorption lines might well be detectable either when intrinsic agn luminosities become significantly smaller or when agn are observed as type ii ( i.e.  viewed from the edge of the surrounding dusty torus ) . therefore there can be the following evolutionary path :    @xmath236 .",
    "probably , qsos that experienced stronger starbursts in the gas fuelling ( thus growth ) processes of smbhs are more likely to have detectable balmer absorption lines .",
    "it is also reasonable to claim that strong balmer absorption lines are more likely to be detected in type 2 seyfert than in type 1 owing to the less amount of dilution of stellar light by emission from hidden broad line regions of type 2 seyfert ( with weaker emission lines due to dusty torus around agn ) .",
    "we plan to investigate this point more quantitatively by numerical simulations and compare the results with already existing observational results ( e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "2003a ; cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "as shown in the present chemodynamical study , the metallicities of stellar populations around smbhs in galaxy mergers become very high ( @xmath237 ) owing to rapid chemical enrichment associated with starbursts during galaxy merging .",
    "furthermore , as a natural result of chemical evolution , the stellar metallicities around smbhs are higher in the later phase of galaxy merging .",
    "these results imply that stellar populations in later agn phases ( e.g. , qsos and liners ) are more likely to be more metal - rich than those in earlier starburst phases for galaxy mergers with starbursts and agn .",
    "our previous chemodynamical simulations suggested that the abundance ratio of [ mg / fe ] after strong starburst of galaxy mergers can be significantly larger than the solar value due to the dominant contribution of type ii supernovae ( bekki & shioya 1999 ) .",
    "therefore we suggest that _ qsos with younger poststarburst populations can show large [ mg / fe ] ratios if qsos are evolved from ulirgs formed by galaxy mergers .",
    "_      the present study has investigated mergers between two disk galaxies and thereby demonstrated that ulirgs can be formed in the very late phase of galaxy merging when two galaxies nearly complete their merging .",
    "thus the present model can be more relevant to ulirgs with single cores : the presence of ulirgs with multiple cores observed in some ulirgs ( e.g. , borne et al .",
    "2000 ; colina et al .",
    "2001 ; bushouse et al .",
    "2002 ) can not be simply explained by the present pair merger models ( taniguchi & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "previous numerical simulations showed that ( 1 ) a compact group of galaxies can be transformed into an elliptical galaxy through multiple merging of the group member galaxies ( barnes 1989 ; weil & hernquest 1996 ) , ( 2 ) repetitive and multiple starbursts can be triggered by multiple merging of disk galaxies ( bekki 2001 ) , and ( 3 ) the origin of metal - poor , hot gaseous halo of field giant ellipticals can be closely associated with tidal stripping of metal - poor gas in multiple mergers ( bekki 2001 ) .",
    "however , previously numerical studies did not calculate the accretion rates onto smbhs and the seds in multiple mergers so that they could not provide any theoretical predictions as to ( 1 ) whether multiple mergers can become agn - dominated ulirgs or starburst - dominated ones , ( 2 ) in what physical conditions starbursts and agn can be obscured heavily enough to become ulirgs emitting almost all energy in infrared bands , and ( 3 ) what is the dynamical fate of multiple smbhs fallen into the central regions of the remnants of multiple mergers .",
    "thus we plan to investigate the above questions based on more sophisticated , higher - resolution simulations that allow us to study both dynamical evolution of multiple smbhs and gas accretion onto the smbhs .",
    "the results of these future simulations , combined with those of the present study , will allow us to ( 1 ) investigate what types of compact groups ( e.g. , spiral - rich groups ) can become starburst - dominated ulirgs or agn - dominated ones ( or much less luminous infrared galaxies ) in their conversion processes into field elliptical galaxies via multiple galaxy merging and ( 2 ) discuss statistics of the observed morphological properties ( e.g. , single or multiple cores ) of ulirgs ( e.g. , murphy et al .",
    "1996 ; zheng et al . 1999 ; borne et al . 1999 ; 2000 ; colina et al .",
    "2001 ; cui et al .",
    "2001 ; bushouse et al .",
    "2002 ; goto 2005 ) .",
    "these simulations will also help us to understand physical relationships between compact group of galaxies , multiple mergers , ulirgs with hot gaseous halos ( xia et al .",
    "2002 ; huo et al .",
    "2004 ) , qsos with companion galaxies ( stockton & ridgway 1991 ; disney et al .",
    "1995 ; hutchings & morris 1995 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) , `` fossil group '' with the central giant ellipticals ( e.g. , ponman et al . 1994 ; jones et al .",
    "we have numerically investigated both sfrs and ars in forming ulirgs via gas - rich galaxy merging in an self - consistent way .",
    "dependences of the time evolution of sfrs and ars on model parameters are mainly investigated .",
    "we summarize our principle results as follows :    \\(1 ) ulirgs powered by agn can be formed by major merging between luminous , gas - rich disk galaxies with prominent bulges containing smbhs owing to the efficient gas fuelling ( @xmath2 yr@xmath3 ) to the smbhs .",
    "agn in these ulirgs can be surrounded by compact poststarburst stellar populations ( e.g. , a - type stars ) .",
    "these results suggest that ulirgs and qsos can show strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "\\(2 ) ulirgs powered by starbursts with @xmath4 yr@xmath3 can be formed by merging between gas - rich disk galaxies with small bulges having the bulge - to - disk - ratio ( @xmath5 ) as small as 0.1 .",
    "as long as the accretion radii ( @xmath77 ) of smbhs are proportional to the masses of the smbhs , galaxy mergers with smaller bulges are more likely to become starburst - dominated ulirgs ( i.e. , they can not show agn activity owing to a smaller amount of gas accretion onto the smbhs ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the relative importance of starbursts and agn can depend on physical properties of merger progenitor disks , such as @xmath5 , gas mass fraction , and total masses .",
    "for example , more massive galaxy mergers are more likely to become agn - dominated ulirgs .",
    "\\(4 ) for most models , major mergers can become ulirgs powered either by starbursts or by agn , when the two bulges finally merge .",
    "interacting disk galaxies can become ulirgs with well separated two cores ( @xmath6 20kpc ) at their pericenter only when they are very massive and have small bulges .",
    "these suggest that it is highly unlikely for interacting / merging pair of galaxies to become ulirgs with double / multiple nuclei .",
    "we note , however , the results of veilleux et al ( 2002 ) , who found that about 7% of ulirgs in their sample have nuclear separations in excess of 20kpc .",
    "this may suggest that ulirgs can be formed via alternate routes to the major mergers examined herein .",
    "\\(5 ) irrespectively of models , interacting / merging galaxies show the highest accretion rates onto the central smbhs and the resultant rapid growth of the smbhs , when their star formation rates are very high .",
    "\\(6 ) ars can become high ( @xmath238 ) enough to show qso - like activities ( @xmath239 ) mostly in major mergers between massive disk galaxies with remarkable bulges .",
    "ars however can not reach the required rates for qsos ( @xmath240 ) in minor and unequal - mass mergers that form s0s .",
    "these results therefore imply that only forming elliptical via major mergers can show qso - like activities whereas forming s0s ( or early - type spirals with big bulges ) via minor and unequal - mass merging show low luminosity agn ( e.g. , type 1/2 seyfert ) .",
    "\\(7 ) maximum ars ( @xmath216 ) can correlate with maximum sfrs ( @xmath215 ) in the sense that galaxy mergers with higher @xmath215 are likely to show higher @xmath216 .",
    "this suggests that mergers and ulirgs with more pronounced agn activities are likely to show stronger starburst components in their nuclei .",
    "the correlations can be discussed in the context of recent observational results ( e.g. , goto 2005 ) on correlations between infrared luminosities of ulirgs , star formation rates , and agn luminosities ( measured from [ oiii ] emission lines ) .",
    "\\(8 ) the ratio of @xmath216 to @xmath241 can correlate with @xmath216 in the sense that galaxy mergers with higher @xmath216 are likely to show higher @xmath217 .",
    "this implies that merger and ulirgs with higher agn ( thus total ) luminosities are likely to be dominated by agn rather than by starbursts .",
    "this result can be also consistent with recent results on agn fraction as a function of infrared luminosities of galaxies ( e.g. , goto 2005 ) .",
    "\\(9 ) there could be evolutionary links between ulirgs , q+a s , qsos , and e+a s .",
    "galaxy mergers between less massive disks are more likely to evolve from starburst - dominated ulirgs into e+as without experiencing qso phases , whereas those between more massive disks with prominent bulges can evolve from agn - dominated ulirgs , to qsos ( and/or q+a s ) , and finally to e+a s , if the lifetimes of qsos are as short as @xmath235 gyr .",
    "removal of gas reservoir for star formation via supernovae and agn feedback could be essentially important for the above evolutionary links .",
    "\\(10 ) time evolution of emission line properties of galaxies with starbursts and agns is investigated based on sfrs and ars derived from chemodynamical simulations . for example",
    ", simulated mergers are demonstrated to evolve from those with smaller /h@xmath7 ( starburst - dominated ) to those with larger /h@xmath7",
    "( agb - dominated ) .",
    "it is suggested that strong balmer absorption lines are more likely to be detected in type 2 seyfert than in type 1 owing to the less amount of dilution of stellar light by emission from hidden broad line regions of type 2 seyfert .",
