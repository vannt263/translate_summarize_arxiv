    "astrophysical evidences for dark matter ( dm ) exist from galactic to cosmological scales , but the interactions with ordinary matter have not been probed beyond gravitational effects . in this sense ,",
    "both direct and indirect dm searches are fundamental to explore particle models of dm .",
    "if dm annihilate or decay in standard model ( sm ) particles , we may indirectly detect the secondary products of such processes in astrophysical sources where the dm density is dominant . in this context , the observation of secondary particles is highly affected by astrophysical uncertainties , such as the dm densities and distribution in the galaxy and the astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "in particular , the galactic center ( gc ) represents an interesting source due to its closeness to the earth , but also a complex region because of the large amount of sources present . in this work ,",
    "we review the analysis of the data collected by the hess collaboration during the years 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 associated to the hess j1745 - 290 gc gamma - ray source as a combination of a dm signal with an astrophysical power - law background .",
    "the best fits are obtained for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 quark channels and for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge bosons with large astrophysical factors @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such a parameter is affected not only by the astrophysical uncertainty , but also by the error introduced by the use of differential fluxes simulated by means of monte carlo event generator software .",
    "the exact estimation of the last effect depends on several factors , such as the annihilation channel , the energy of the process and the energy range of interest @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we focus on the @xmath2 annihilation channel . in addiction to the gamma rays study , we present some prediction on the prospective neutrino flux that may be originated by the same source . +",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we revisit the equations able to describe both the gamma ray and neutrino fluxes from galactic sources .",
    "the second section focuses on gamma rays phenomenology .",
    "there we show the fit of the hess data for the @xmath2 annihilation channel .",
    "although the analysis is model independent , such annihilation channel possesses some interest for heavy dark matter models @xcite , such as branons among others @xcite . in order to give an estimation of the error introduced by the monte carlo simulations , we analyze the case of photon spectra generated by both pythiaand herwigpackages , both in fortran and c++ . in particular we show results for @xmath5 tev center - of - mass events in the @xmath2 channel ( see @xcite for more cases ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the expected neutrino signal from the annihilation of the heavy dm required to produce the hess gamma - ray signal .",
    "in general , both gamma ray and neutrino flux for one particular annihilation channel can be described by the equation for uncharged particles that travel without deviation due to galactic magnetic fields : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the secondary uncharged particle . when @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the neutrino flavor .",
    "the dm annihilation channel is fixed by the @xmath10-th sm - particle . because we performed single channel model independent fits , the astrophysical factor depends on the annihilation channel . here , we present the results for the @xmath11 boson channel .",
    "the differential number of particles @xmath12 is simulated by means of the monte carlo event generator software , as discussed in section @xmath13 . unlike gamma rays , the composition of the neutrino flux produced at the source can differ from that detected on the earth because of the combination of different flavors produced by oscillations @xcite .",
    "as introduced before , the gamma rays signal observed by hess between @xmath14 gev and @xmath15 tev from the gc direction may be a combination of a dm signal with a simple power - law background .",
    "the total fitting function for the observed differential gamma ray flux is :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 needs to be fitted together with the dm particle mass @xmath18 , the background amplitude @xmath19 and spectral index @xmath20 . by means of the fit of the parameters @xmath21 ,",
    "the astrophysical factor @xmath22 \\,{\\rm d}l(\\psi)\\ , , \\label{j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is also indirectly fitted . in the previous expression",
    ", @xmath23 holds for the distance from the sun to any point in the halo .",
    "it is related with the radial distance @xmath24 from the gc as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 kpc is the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy .",
    "the maximum distance from the sun to the edge of the halo in the direction @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the photon flux must be averaged over the solid angle of the detector . for the hess telescope observing gamma rays in the tev energy scale ,",
    "it is of order @xmath29 . the dm density distribution in the galaxy halo is usually modeled by the nfw profile @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the overall normalization and @xmath32 the scale radius .",
    "this profile is in good agreement with n - body non - baryonic cold dm simulations of the gc . in this case and",
    "accounting for just annihilating dm , the astrophysical factor is : @xmath33 .",
    "we will use this value as standard reference in order to define the boost factor as @xmath34 .",
    "the differential number of gamma photons @xmath35 is simulated by pythia6.4 and the analytical fitting functions of such simulations are used to get the fit @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and table [ tab : tab1 ] we report the results of the gamma rays fit of the @xmath2 channel .",
    "the fit well reproduces the spectral form and the energy cut - off for a dm mass of @xmath36 tev and a boost factor of @xmath37 .",
    "the background is also fitted and its amplitude and spectral index are in agreement with the fermi - lat data @xcite . the uncertainty introduced by the choice of the simulator",
    "is discussed in the next section .        .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the differential number of photons simulated by monte carlo event generators software is the result of a particle shower schematization in three parts : the qcd final - state radiation , the hadronization model and the qed final - state radiation .",
    "the four codes differ in each one of the aforementioned fundamental parts and the combination of these intrinsic differences to the final spectra is complicated ( see  @xcite for details ) . in any case",
    ", it seems clear that the parton shower evolution variable affects the qcd final - state radiation  @xcite , while the hadronization model ( string model in @xmath38  @xcite and cluster model in @xmath39  @xcite ) produces unstable hadrons which eventually decay .",
    "the resultant final states of such process are mainly leptons leading the photon production that involves qed processes .",
    "finally , the bremsstrahlung component of the final - state radiation ( fsr ) represents the main difference between the codes , for photons spectra at least .",
    "in fact , the bremsstrahlung of very high energy leptons is not implemented in herwigc++ , it is just partially implemented in herwigfortran , while it is implemented both in pythia++ and pythiafortran .",
    "the electroweak ( ew ) @xmath40 processes of the fsr , despite their different implementations for different codes , do not significantly affect the gamma - ray spectra . +    [",
    "3 ] for annihilating dm , the photon spectra are better described in terms of the dimensionless variable : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 correspond to the energy of the photon and center of mass ( cm ) , respectively .",
    "this variable lies in the range between 0 to 1 . because the standard monte carlo adjust uses data at @xmath44 gev of center of mass energy from colliders such as lep and lhc , large differences in the spectra are usually present at very low or very high values of @xmath45 .",
    "for this reason , we present the spectra in both linear and logarithmic scales for @xmath45 , in order to show more clearly the behavior in the first and second case , respectively . here",
    ", we focused on dm particle mass of @xmath46  tev ( see @xcite for the same analysis with @xmath47 dm annihilating into @xmath2 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 gev dm mass in the case of @xmath51 and further details on @xmath46 tev dm mass for more channels ) .",
    "the photon spectra are independent of the initial beams ( details on the generation of the spectra can be found in @xcite ) and solely depend on the energy of the event , i.e. @xmath52 for annihilating dm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w1000 g ] we show that the simulated gamma - ray spectra for dm particles annihilating in @xmath2 are very similar for @xmath53 for a dm mass of @xmath46 tev .",
    "the lower fluxes generated by herwig++at high energies ( linear scale ) are probably due to the lack in the implementation of the bremsstrahlung radiation from high energy leptons .",
    "+ although the low energy spectra are less important in the context of indirect searches due to the dominance of the astrophysical background , let us underline that the low energy cut - off strongly depends on the set parameters of each software . in pythia8",
    "the cut - off at low energy exactly corresponds to the minimum value allowed for photons and set by the ` ptminchgl ` parameter , that is 0.005 by default . in herwig++ , ` qedradiationhandler ` is set off by default , so that the cut - off appears at higher energy with respect to the other monte carlo generators . in the opposite case ,",
    "when ` qedradiationhandler ` is enable , the spectrum at low energy changes drastically . in this case , the relevant parameter ` ifdipole : minimumenergyrest ` can be varied in values : small values of such parameter enlarge the production of photons at low energies .",
    "three different low energy cutoffs for the @xmath54 channel are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : w1tevqed ] .",
    "+     channel with herwig++ at @xmath55 tev in logarithmic scale .",
    "the three cuts - off correspond to ` qedradiationhandler ` of @xmath56 . ]",
    "more interesting are the spectra at high energies .",
    "we present the monte carlo relative deviation ( @xmath57 ) with respect to pythia8 in fig .",
    "[ errrel ] , defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for pythia6.4 , herwigand herwig++ . for a dm mass of @xmath46 tev and @xmath60 boson annihilation channel ,",
    "the relative deviations for @xmath61 are always less than @xmath62 up to @xmath63 . at @xmath64",
    "the absence of bremsstrahlung radiation generated by high energy leptons in herwig++ leads to a smaller number of high - energy photons when compared to the other softwares .",
    "[ er_w ]    also the multiplicity , that is the total number of photons produced by each event , affects the constraints . apart from the specific characteristics of the detector , the flux of photons depends upon the dm density distribution and the distance of the sources",
    "thus , two simulations should give different number of photons for the same number of events and this will affect the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in general , the multiplicity depends on both the monte carlo event generator , the energy of the event and the annihilation channel . for the @xmath60 boson channel , it does not depend on the mass above @xmath67 gev , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ errrel ] . in this study , the energy cut - off increases with the dm mass , because we set a lower photon energy cut - off around @xmath68 .",
    "this kind of dm mass depending cut - off allows to reject photons of lower energies , where the simulations present important differences , and the contribution to gamma rays is less important .",
    "this cut - off is also compatible with typical gamma - ray detectors energy thresholds , in fact detector energy thresholds are typically around @xmath69 gev depending on the particular experimental device @xcite . in any case",
    ", our results do not seem to depend on the particular choice of this cut - off .",
    "the multiplicity behavior is well approximated by the following power law relation with the dm mass : @xmath70 the @xmath71 and @xmath66 coefficients are given in @xcite .",
    "they depend on both the monte carlo simulator and the annihilation channel .",
    "when the sm particle is fixed , cosmological constraints obtained by means of the total number of generated gamma photons might depend on the monte carlo simulation .",
    "+ in the case of the @xmath2 and whenever the dm annihilation cross section is fixed , pythia6.4 provides lower limit values for astrophysical factor / boost factor in gamma rays , depending on the kind of fit . on the other hand",
    ", herwigfortran gives the upper limit for similar analysis ( see fig .",
    "[ errrel ] and @xcite for details ) . in any case , the difference between pythia6.4 and pythia8 , the latter being the most complete monte carlo software for gamma rays , is less that a @xmath72 .",
    "as for gamma rays , the differential neutrino flux from annihilating dm in the galaxy is described by the equation ( [ nuflux ] ) . as a difference with the gamma ray case ,",
    "the neutrino flux on the earth is not the same as at the source , due to neutrinos oscillations and observational limits .",
    "in fact , neutrino telescopes are able to discriminate between @xmath73 and @xmath74 or @xmath75 , but they can not identify either @xmath74 from @xmath75 or neutrinos from anti - neutrinos .",
    "so , the interpolation functions of the differential neutrinos spectra simulated by pythia8 @xcite need to be slightly modified . in fig .",
    "[ wnu ] we show the expected neutrino flux on earth when neutrino oscillations and observational limits are taken into account . because all the parameters of the model are fitted by the observation in gamma rays , observability of the neutrinos flux depends only on a combination of the resolution angle and effective area of the telescope with the minimum energy threshold and the exposition time .",
    "both the angle and the area depend on the neutrino flavor and the position of the source in the sky with respect to the detector @xcite . in the case of the gc , it should be possible in principle to get better resolution angle with antares @xcite than with icecube @xcite . in the first case",
    "the earth is used as veto and the background is given by atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "on the other hand , when the background is given as most by atmospheric muons , as in the case of icecube , the effective area of the detector is affected .",
    "the icecube collaboration reports the @xmath73 and @xmath74 atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ wnu ] , no flux is expected with resolution lower that @xmath76 from high density @xmath77 tev dm annihilating into @xmath2 channel in the gc .",
    "thus we need better resolution angles in order to be able to get some signature above the background .",
    "in fact , the statistical significance of the signal above the background is given by @xmath78 @xmath79 depends also on the minimum energy threshold , exposition time and effective area . in fig .",
    "[ aeff ] we show the statistical analysis for @xmath73 track events for a generic neutrino telescope with @xmath80 .",
    "so , with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 tev , an angle @xmath84 is requested to get a signal measurement with a confidence level better than @xmath85 . similar analysis was developed fixing the resolution angle and searching for the @xmath86 parameter with respect to the minimum energy threshold @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the gamma - ray and neutrino flux that should be generated by a very peaked dm distribution in the gc and presented partial results for the @xmath2 annihilation channel .",
    "the study is based on the fit of the hess data in gamma rays allowing to constrain the dm mass and the astrophysical factor . among other channels , the collection of data of the cerenkov detector for the j1745 - 290 source is well fitted as @xmath77 tev dm annihilating into @xmath2 boson particles .",
    "the signal is superimposed on a gamma - ray background compatible with the fermi - lat observation .",
    "we have also analyzed the uncertainty that may be introduced by the simulation of gamma - ray flux with different monte carlo particle physics codes .",
    "the relative deviation between different codes turns out to be less than @xmath62 for the boson channel at the energy range of interest , whereas the number of photons produced for each event introduces an error less than @xmath72 .",
    "these uncertainties may affect the @xmath87 enhancement of the astrophysical factor necessary to fit the data .",
    "the astrophysical factor may also be affected by the astrophysical uncertainty due to the choice of the dm density profile . in any case , its value is compatible with the baryonic enhancement in monte carlo cosmological n - body simulation @xcite , although opposed opinions about this scenario remain @xcite . for the dm particle",
    "able to fit the gamma - rays data , we have also presented the prospects for the detection of the neutrinos flux to be generated by that particle .",
    "it depends both on the resolution angle and effective area of the neutrino telescope , in addition to the minimum energy threshold and the observation time .",
    "we sketched a partial study of the combined resolution angle and the energy threshold needed to detect a neutrino signal within some confidence level , when the effective area and the exposition time are fixed .",
    "a resolution angle of @xmath88 is requested to get @xmath85 signal above the background for neutrino telescope with effective area compatible with antares or icecube , but more exposition time than we have available with the actual collection of data @xcite is required . therefore ,",
    "at the present stage we are not able to either accept nor reject the dm origin for gamma rays data with the present generation of neutrino detectors .",
    "an improvement in the angular resolution of antares or icecube when looking at the gc may be fundamental in order to clarify dm hypotheses .",
    "moreover , the observation of this region with the next km3net neutrino detector @xcite , with an effective area of @xmath89 and improved resolution angle , will be also of great interest .",
    "finally , the observation of antimatter flux and matter - antimatter ratio as proton , antiproton and positron signal , may be useful to set additional constraints on the dm origin .",
