    "technological progress in the fields of superconducting quantum circuits  @xcite and nanophotonics  @xcite are opening the door to new quantum technologies based on propagating photons and few - level systems , such as few - photon transistors  @xcite , non - classical states of the radiation field  @xcite or new photodetector schemes  @xcite .",
    "of particular fundamental interest are also proposals to use these low - dimensional photonic systems to mediate interactions between qubits  @xcite , for which there are already initial implementations in the superconducting world  @xcite , and which could potentially have applications in the quantum information world , as well as in quantum simulation and the study of quantum phase transitions .    at the same time that this technology evolves , we need to further develop the theoretical tools that study the light - matter and light - mediated matter interactions .",
    "while there exist approximation methods for some of the optical technologies mentioned above , based on single - photon single - qubit effective boundary conditions  @xcite , input - output theory  @xcite or scattering theory  @xcite , the degree of control of some methods or their computational generality for any number of photons is an open problem .",
    "matrix product state ( mps ) methods are one novel tool that solves some of the limitations of earlier methods regarding photon numbers and interaction strengths to describe the full light - matter wavefunction and its time evolution .",
    "these methods rely on a _ discretization _ of the photonic degrees of freedom either in frequency or in position space , and seem to provide qualitatively and even quantitatively accurate results for problems of few photon scattering  @xcite .",
    "two questions open : how can we validate these models and discretizations and how do they compare to the usual techniques , i.e. master equations and markovian approximations .",
    "this work dwells into these problems by studying a very precise feature of the numerical approximations mentioned above : the discretization of the photonic degrees of freedom .",
    "we study the effective interaction of two qubits in the weak- and strong - coupling regime , both within the rotating wave approximation and with matrix product states , for a variety of underlying microscopic models of the photonic degrees of freedom . combining theoretical estimates based on the wigner - weisskopf theory with exact analytical studies of the single - excitation or rotating wave approximation ( rwa )",
    "limit we prove that the markovian approximation is only well justified for qubits inside their mutual light - cones and develop accurate numerical procedures to extract the effective parameters of the qubit - qubit interaction and collective decay .",
    "these parameters agree qualitatively with earlier works based on the resonant - dipole approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , we also find collective effects ( lamb - shifts ) which strongly depend on the cut - offs and the microscopic details of the interaction , and which renormalize the qubit frequencies , their interactions and the effective individual and collective dissipation .",
    "the renormalization effects can be of measurable magnitude , increasing with the qubit - qubit separation , and we suggest how recent experiments with superconducting circuits could probe those features .",
    "there are two reasons why one could doubt of these non - universal renormalization effect : such effects have not been found in theoretical studies of single - photon scattering  @xcite and we have derived them using rwa equations .",
    "we dispel the first criticism studing the lippmann - schwinger scattering formalism and proving that its resonances are determined by the same renormalized parameters of the theoretical model .",
    "we also study existing single - photon scattering literature and conclude that the `` toy''-models used to represent the photons are often too simple and have zero lamb shifts . finally , we report on quasi - exact numerical simulations of the full spin - boson model including counter - rotating terms , for exactly the same parameters of the rwa simulations .",
    "these mps simulations confirm the rwa results for coupling strengths below five percent of the qubit gap , @xmath0 , which is the current operating regime for circuit - qed in open transmission lines  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this manuscript is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : models ] we introduce a simplified light - matter interaction model for two qubits that talk to a one - dimensional photonic medium .",
    "we derive the evolution equations for the qubits in the single - excitation limit and obtain the markovian approximation and resulting master equation with care .",
    "this derivation pays great attention to the infrarred and ultraviolet cut - offs of the problem , leading us to conclude that individual and collective lamb - shift influence the qubit frequencies , and the spontaneous and collective emission rates of the qubits beyond earlier predictions . in sect .",
    "[ sec : ls - theory ] we relate the parameters of the markovian model with the lippmann - schiwnger scattering states and dicuss why earlier scattering studies did not show the renormalization effects . while the theoretical results so far were based on a few solvable models , in sects .  [ sec : gapless ] and [ sec : band ] we return to physically realistic models of waveguides and of photonic crystals .",
    "we confirm the role of the cut - off frequency in the single - qubit renormalization and in the two - qubit interactions in both cases . in sect .",
    "[ sec : mps ] we introduce numerical simulations based on matrix product states and confirm that they agree with the theoretical predictions in the strong - coupling limit . finally in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize the main consequences of this study and discuss possible experimental studies of these non - universal effects .",
    "we wish to study the interaction of one or more two - level systems with a photonic medium . for that we rely on the spin - boson model , which is a convenient description for the type of implementations where this problem has some interest namely superconducting circuits and nanophotonics .",
    "the model reads @xmath1 the light - matter coupling typically adopts the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dispersion relation , @xmath4 is the position of the @xmath5-th qubit in real space , @xmath6 is the physical length of the one - dimensional medium and @xmath7 is a parameter measuring the coupling strength .",
    "as discussed below , the model   adopts different dispersion relations and coupling strengths depending on the microscopic description of the underlying photonic medium . for computational reasons , in any of these descriptions we will have to impose both a finite medium size , @xmath6 , and a spatial discretization @xmath8",
    "this leads to a discretization of the momenta @xmath9    in either case we may introduce the spectral function @xmath10 using the fact that momenta are equispaced , and that the frequency spacing @xmath11 is inversely proportional to the density of states , @xmath12 , we may write @xmath13 if we assume the rwa and study the spontaneous emission of a two - level system interacting with this waveguide , we will obtain that the spontaneous emission rate is @xmath14 , independent of the microscopic details of the discretization we used .",
    "we will typically consider two types of problems : gapless photons and a photonic crystal with a finite bandwidth .",
    "the first case corresponds to a chain of coupled oscillators and it models the propagation of optical photons or microwave photons in a waveguide  @xcite . the dispersion relation has the form @xmath15 with a cut - off @xmath16 that depends on the discretization . with this choice of units ,",
    "the dispersion relation becomes linear at low momenta , @xmath17 , with unit speed of light , @xmath18 .",
    "the other possible problem that we will study is a chain of coupled cavities . in this case",
    "the dispersion relation has a finite bandwidth @xmath19 and the discretization step plays no role , so that we can take @xmath20 .",
    "finally , in addition to these models with a finite number of modes , we will consider a continuum limit in frequency space that has @xmath21 and introduces the cut - off in the coupling strength , not on the dispersion relation @xmath22 this exponential cut - off is usually employed in studies of the spin - boson model  @xcite because it allows efficient computation of memory functions and analytical predictions .",

    "in which @xmath7 is small compared with the qubit and photon frequencies  @xcite , we can simplify the spin - boson model adopting the so called rotating - wave approximation , in which the counterrotating terms @xmath24 are neglected . in the rwa limit",

    "the evolution equations for the state read @xmath27 we integrate formally the photons and plug this expression into the qubits @xmath28 each qubit has an input signal that either comes from the photonic field , or from a memory function that concerns the dynamics of all of the qubits in the past @xmath29 with the kernel @xmath30\\mathrm{d}\\omega_k\\nonumber \\\\    & = k(t ; d_{ss ' } ) + k(t ; -d_{ss'}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a linear dispersion relation , @xmath31 , the previous kernel adopts the form @xmath32 , implying that the separation between qubits induces a delay in the mutual interaction .",
    "equation   can be manipulated to study the dynamics of the qubit and the field under further approximations .",
    "the most common one is the markov approximation in which we assume that the memory of the field decays much faster than the time it takes for the qubit to evolve .",
    "if we have a single qubit , we will be concerned with the evolution of the single memory function @xmath33 .",
    "we assume a - priori , that @xmath34 evolves as @xmath35 , with some renormalized frequency @xmath36 that is close to the original qubit frequency @xmath37 , and a slow function @xmath38 : @xmath39 this leads to a memoryless equation for one qubit @xmath40 replacing the memory function with the constants @xmath41 using the identity @xmath42,\\ ] ] we obtain the correction to the qubit frequency and the decay rate as solutions of the self - consistency equation @xmath43     and try different cut - offs . in ( b )",
    "we fix the cut - off @xmath44 and change @xmath36 .",

    "note how the renormalization of the qubit frequency @xmath49 may become significantly larger than the decay rate itself , diverging as the cut - off increases .",

    "the outcome should read @xmath53 with the additional constants @xmath54 there are several caveats on eq .",
    "the first one is that this equation now is only valid for times @xmath55 , larger than the time it takes a photon emitted by qubit @xmath56 to arrive to qubit @xmath57 . before that time , as we will see below , the qubits evolve almost independent from each other , in an approximate causality .",
    "there are also some subtleties when we try to estimate the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "firstly , eq .   neglects the effect of the collective coupling @xmath58 in the renormalization of the single - qubit frequencies @xmath60 .",
    "secondly , @xmath58 is related to the principal value part of the spectral function .",
    "we can not compute this in closed form because the rwa precludes the use of the kamers - kronning relation , but assuming that non - rwa terms are negligible we can approximate @xmath58 by the expression that results from the full model ( see suppl .",
    "matt . in  @xcite ) . based on these considerations ,",
    "an approximate set of constants for this problem that is often used in the literature , combines eq .   with the resonant dipole approximation @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the positive momentum associated to @xmath63 .",
    "an important prediction of this formula is that , as long as it is valid , _ dipole - dipole interactions can be suppressed _ by placing quantum emitters at distances such that @xmath64 .",

    ".        we can simulate multiple different processes to recover the dependency of @xmath51 , @xmath73 and @xmath72 on the qubit separation @xmath69 .",
    "this is shown in figure fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric - gapless ] for different discretizations of the chain . in each curve",
    "we employed a different number of sites @xmath168 , but always the same length @xmath169 .",
    "note that both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are approximately periodic , as in the analytically solvable models , with a period that depends on the discretization and thus on the cut - off frequency .",
    "this is a sign of the qubit gap renormalization .",
    "studying the photon wavelength from the zeroes of the @xmath73 and @xmath72 we are able to obtain the dependance of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath170 or @xmath129 as it is showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : renormd ] .",
    "the value of the individual spontaneous emission rate @xmath51 was also predicted to oscillate due to the influence of the collective lamb shifts in the decay rate .",
    "when we average over @xmath171 over the qubit separation , this collective lamb shift is averaged out and we obtain a mean value that only depends on @xmath36 and , since @xmath172 , follows a similar curve to fig .",
    "[ fig : renormd ] .      in this second case instead of having a transmission line with free travelling photons , we consider a photonic crystal  .",
    "this dispersion relation may be obtained , for instance , by coupling together multiple cavities or patterning a waveguide . in this case",
    "the photon s speed , determined by the group velocity , depends on its frequency .",
    "we will fix @xmath173 , so that this group velocity is strictly the coupling strength @xmath174",
    "@xmath175 the actual length of the photonic medium is @xmath176 the number of sites in the crystal .",
    "however now the dispersion relation does not depend on @xmath122 and the number of modes will only influence features such as the propagation time of the photons and the smoothness of the curves .",
    "as before , the numerical integration works with the full model  , now studying only the influence of the band width @xmath174 and the qubit separation @xmath69 . once more , we find an approximate light cone , this time governed by the group velocity @xmath177 .",
    "once more we compute the collective variables @xmath165 numerically inside and outside the light cone and fit the numerical results to the theoretical curves .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric - band ] we plot the fitted parameters @xmath178 , @xmath51 and @xmath73 as a function of the qubit separation for different bandwidths , @xmath174 .",
    "note how the spontaneous emission rate and the interactions grow with decreasing bandwith . physically this may be understood as a consequence of the reduced photon velocity and an increase in the spectral density around the two - level system , which facilitate the interaction between the second qubit and the photon that was originally emitted .",
    "note also that due to the very small cut - off , which can not grow beyond @xmath179 , there is a negligible renormalization of the qubit frequency , which is almost invisible in @xmath51 and impossible to recover from the periods of @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "we finish the theoretical study by performing the same simulations in a more general situation , that is the full spin - boson model   without resorting to the single - excitation or rwa approximation .",
    "we do this by using the matrix product state ansatz for solving numerically the full spin - boson model with both qubits interacting with the bosonic bath .",
    "the method used is a generalization of the one outlined in  @xcite , introducing one more qubit and applying the same model fitting techniques to extract the parameters @xmath180 and @xmath36 .",
    "the scope of this paper the study of qubit - qubit interactions for realistic couplings , with @xmath181 , such as the ones describing transmon or ordinary flux qubits close to an open transmission line .",
    "the outcome of these simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mps ] , where we plot the markovian parameters from one mps simulation together with a numerical simulation using the rwa and single - excitation limit .",
    "the main message from those simulations is therefore that the rwa accurately describes the qubit and photon dynamics for the weak and strong - coupling regimes .",
    "the numerical and theoretical results from earlier sections should therefore apply to ongoing experiments and could be verified in state - of - the art setups that already study photon - qubit interactions .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of one and two qubits coupled to an open transmission line . we have related the dynamics of these qubits , in a regime of weak or strong coupling @xmath182 to the rwa or single - excitation equations . from these equations",
    "we have derived carefully the markovian limit , studying the approximations involved and paying special attention to the single - qubit and collective lamb shifts that arise .",
    "we showed how the markovian parameters may carry a significant and measurable dependence on the microscopic details of the underlying photons , such as their ultraviolet cut - offs and the exact shape of the spectral function .",
    "such features are present not only on the non - equilibrium dynamics of the qubits , but also on the spectroscopy or scattering properties .",
    "our predictions have been confirmed for a large variety of physical models , and also with numerical simulations based on matrix product states without rwa approximations .    , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , in solid line , and the rwa method , in dashed line .",
    "( b ) difference @xmath183 as a function of time and qubit separation , together with the light - cone ( dashed ) .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath158 and @xmath186.[fig : mps ] ]    one take - home message of this work is that the microscopic details of qubits interacting with propagating photons can have a measurable impact in the quantum - optical properties of the qubits . in order to experimentally probe those effects",
    "one needs to be able to change such microscopic models . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a very useful setup to realize such changes has already been demonstrated in the lab  @xcite .",
    "the experiment would consist on mobile transmon qubits that are suspended over a transmission line , thereby allowing us to change the coupling strength and the qubit - qubit separation , and thus obtaining not only the curves @xmath187 and @xmath72 , but also the bare parameters in the absence of renormalizations .",
