    "the present cern program in experimental kaon physics is represented by the na48 series of experiments at the sps accelerator ( physics runs in 19972004 ) , and its continuation na62 ( the first physics run carried out in 2007 ) .",
    "several na48/na62 activities aiming at the search for phenomena beyond the standard model ( sm ) are discussed in the present paper .",
    "these are 1 ) precise testing of lepton universality by measurement of @xmath2 based on test data samples collected in 2003 and 2004 and a dedicated run of 2007 ; 2 ) designing an experiment to measure the branching ratio of a very rare kaon decay @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath4 structure and lepton universality are the two cornerstones of the current description of weak interactions .",
    "the observation of the @xmath5 decay at cern in 1958 followed by later measurements of @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 provided verifications of the @xmath4 theory , confirming the suppression of electronic decay modes due to helicity conservation .",
    "the ratio @xmath3 can be predicted with a good accuracy in terms of fundamental parameters due to a large degree of cancellation of the hadronic uncertainties . by convention , the inner bremsstrahlung part of the @xmath8 process is included into @xmath3 , while the structure dependent part ( which is difficult to predict theoretically ) is not . within the sm , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an electromagnetic correction  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath11 accounts for the helicity suppression of the @xmath12 mode .",
    "a recent theoretical study  @xcite pointed out that , due to the helicity suppression of @xmath3 in the sm , lepton - flavour violating effects arising in super - symmetric extensions can induce sizable violations of the @xmath13 universality , shifting @xmath3 from the sm value by a relative amount that can be in the percent range , without contradicting any other presently known experimental constraints .",
    "the current world average @xmath14  @xcite is compatible with the sm prediction , being however far from its current level of accuracy .",
    "the na48 program dedicated to study of the charged kaon decays , known as the na48/2 experiment , is based on the physics runs of 200304 .",
    "the experiment was designed to excel in charge asymmetry measurements  @xcite , and is based on simultaneous @xmath15 and @xmath16 beams produced by 400 gev/@xmath17 primary sps protons interacting with a beryllium target .",
    "the layout of the beams and detectors is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : beams ] .",
    "charged particles with momentum @xmath18 gev/@xmath17 are selected by an achromatic system of four dipole magnets with zero total deflection ( ` achromat ' ) , which splits the two beams in the vertical plane and then recombines them on a common axis .",
    "the beams then enter a fiducial decay volume housed in a 114 m long cylindrical vacuum tank .",
    "the decay volume is followed by a magnetic spectrometer consisting of four drift chambers , a trigger scintillator hodoscope , a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter , a hadron calorimeter , and a muon detector .",
    "further details on the experimental setup can be found elsewhere  @xcite .    during a part of the 2003 run ( 4 weeks of data taking )",
    ", a two level @xmath12 trigger chain suitable for @xmath3 measurement was implemented along with the main triggers . the first level ( l1 ) consisted of a time coincidence of hits in the two planes of the hod ( so called @xmath19 signal ) with an energy deposition of at least 10 gev in the calorimeter . the second level ( l2 ) consisted of a requirement",
    "that the missing mass @xmath20 computed using the track momentum measured by the spectrometer in the hypothesis of @xmath21 decay is below the @xmath22 mass .",
    "the @xmath12 trigger was downscaled by a factor ranging from 20 to 40 during the data taking .",
    "the @xmath23 trigger consisted of the @xmath19 condition only downscaled by a factor of @xmath24 .    the 2003 data sample of 4670 @xmath25 candidates with 12% estimated background was used to establish the analysis strategy .",
    "however the data quality appeared to be affected by high inefficiency of the l2 trigger , measured to be about 15% ( while the l1 inefficiency was measured to be below 1% ) . as a consequence , the uncertainty of the 2003 result received a @xmath26 contribution from the l2 trigger inefficiency .    to overcome the above limitation , a dedicated 56 hour run was taken in 2004 with a simplified @xmath12 trigger consisting of the l1 part only without downscaling , the main trigger chains disabled , and beam intensity reduced by a factor of 4 with respect to the nominal value .",
    "analysis of those data led to further refinements of the experimental approach .",
    "event selection is based on ( 1 ) kinematic criteria : @xmath27 candidates are required to have squared missing mass @xmath28 compatible to zero , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are 4-momenta of kaon ( beam average assumed ) and lepton ( electron or muon mass assumed ) ; ( 2 ) particle identification based on the ratio @xmath31 of track energy deposition in the calorimeter to track momentum : particles with @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are identified as electrons ( muons ) .",
    "the use of the identification criteria necessitates a detailed study of the calorimeter response : particle identification probabilities are measured with the data .",
    "analysis of the 2004 data sample containing 3930 @xmath12 candidates with 14% estimated background was focused on the technique of background subtraction in the @xmath12 sample .",
    "the major contribution ( 12% ) is due to @xmath23 decays with muons releasing almost all their energy in the calorimeter by ` catastrophic ' bremsstrahlung .",
    "it contributes at high lepton momenta only , in the region of poor @xmath12/@xmath23 kinematical separation .",
    "its subtraction requires a measurement of the probability @xmath34 of the ( rare ) muon misidentification as electron due to having @xmath32 , which requires selection of a very clean muon sample free of electron admixture . in 200304 data taking conditions , only the kinematical region of low lepton momentum @xmath35  gev/@xmath17 , i.e. good @xmath12/@xmath23 kinematical separation , in which kinematical selection of a pure @xmath23 sample is possible , is accessible for such measurement .",
    "it was measured in this region : @xmath36 .",
    "however theory suggests growth of ` catastrophic ' bremsstrahlung cross section as a function of muon momentum  @xcite , which impedes reliable @xmath23 background subtraction . as a consequence ,",
    "the precision of the 2004 result is limited by a corresponding uncertainty of @xmath37",
    ".      a dedicated @xmath12 run of the na62 experiment was carried out in june  october of 2007 with the aim of reaching an improved level accuracy of better than @xmath39 .",
    "the data taking conditions were optimized with respect to 2004 using the past experience as follows .",
    "* @xmath40 resolution was improved by using narrow band @xmath41 beams ( 2% rms vs 3% in 200304 ) , and larger spectrometer magnet momentum kick ( 263 mev/@xmath17 vs 120 mev/@xmath17 in 200304 , reaching lepton momentum resolution of @xmath42 , @xmath43 in gev/@xmath17 ) .",
    "expected @xmath23 contamination in @xmath12 sample is 7% vs 12% in 200304 .",
    "* selection of pure muon samples in the whole analysis muon momentum range was made possible by installing a @xmath44 thick lead wall ( absorbing a large fraction of electron , but not muon , energy deposition ) between the two planes of the scintillator hodoscope covering @xmath45 of the geometric acceptance .",
    "preliminary measurements of @xmath34 confirm the predicted momentum dependence of this quantity .",
    "* a number of runs with special conditions were carried out to address the measurements of lepton misidentification probabilities , and the background induced by the beam halo .    about @xmath46",
    "@xmath12 candidates with @xmath47 background were collected , data analysis started .",
    "the @xmath1 decay is a fcnc process with the sm branching ratio computed to be @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "its unique theoretical cleanness owes to the possibility of parameterizing the hadronic matrix element via the experimentally well known @xmath50 ; theoretical uncertainty is largely due to those of the ckm matrix elements .",
    "the na62 proposal to collect @xmath51 decays with 10% background in 2 years of operation , as required to match the theory precision , is based on the existing na48 kaon beam line and infrastructure .",
    "the r&d started in 2006 , and data taking is foreseen to start in 2011 .",
    "decay in flight technique is chosen , reaching an acceptance of 10% ; the beam line is required to provide @xmath52 kaon decays from unseparated beam with 6% kaon fraction in about 200 days of data taking .    the experimental signature of the @xmath1 decay is a single reconstructed track in the detector downstream the decay volume in time coincidence with a kaon measured by the upstream beam tracker .",
    "kinematic selection is performed using @xmath53 momentum measurement by a silicon pixel detector in the beam operating at rate of 800 mhz , and @xmath54 momentum measurement by a magnetic spectrometer consisting of straw chambers operating in vacuum .",
    "in addition to kinematic rejection ( which provides large rejection factors for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 decays , but is not sufficient for background suppression ) , the following techniques are used to provide redundancy .",
    "particle identification is based on cedar differential cherenkov counter  @xcite for kaons , and rich detector for pions .",
    "a series of photon detectors are used to provide a hermetic photon veto with an inefficiency of @xmath58 : these are ring shaped scintillator fibre calorimeters at large angles of 1050 mrad , the existing na48 liquid crypton calorimeter at 110 mrad , and a set of small angle vetoes based on shashlyk technology at low angles .",
    "prototypes of the new detectors were successfully tested at cern and frascati in 20062007 ; a series of further tests is foreseen in 2008 .",
