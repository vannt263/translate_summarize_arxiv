    "let @xmath1 be a category with a chosen class of weak equivalences @xmath2 ( @xmath2 is a collection of morphisms in @xmath1 that satisfies the `` 2 out of 3 '' property and contains all isomorphisms ) .",
    "what does it mean that one can do homotopy theory on @xmath3 ?",
    "for us it means three things .",
    "first , we should be able to perform basic operations in @xmath1 such as push - outs / pull - backs and more generally colimits / limits .",
    "second , the derived versions of these functors ( hocolims and holims ) should exist .",
    "third , these derived functors should yield a certain action of the category of simplicial sets @xmath0 on @xmath3 and lead to mapping spaces .",
    "our attitude is that colimits / limits and their derived functors are the fundamental ingredients of homotopy theory and the rest should follow from their properties .",
    "this is an alternative to the approach of hovey presented in  @xcite and more in the spirit of what we believe we have learned from bousfield , dwyer , kan and others , @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the following functor : @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 is the constant functor indexed by the simplex category of @xmath7 ( see  [ pt simplexcat ] ) whose value is @xmath8 .",
    "we would like @xmath9 to be the composition of the localization functor @xmath10 and a functor denoted by the same symbol @xmath11 ( homotopy invariance ) .",
    "the latter should be a homotopy left action ( see  [ pt leftsimpact ] and  [ pt hosimpstruct ] ) , which implies in particular that , for any @xmath12 , the functor @xmath13 has a right adjoint @xmath14 .",
    "this is in our view the universal characterization of what mapping spaces should be .    how can this be realized ? in order to insure the existence of the localized category",
    "@xmath15 $ ] and the derived functors @xmath16s and @xmath17s satisfying the above conditions , we need to be able to do some homotopical algebra on @xmath3 .",
    "one way of formalizing this is to assume that @xmath3 can be given a quillen ( simplicial ) model structure  @xcite .",
    "dwyer and kan explained in  @xcite how to enrich such a category with an action of @xmath0 using the so called `` hammocks '' .",
    "they also introduce the technique of taking ( co)simplicial resolution of the source ( target ) , further developed by hovey in @xcite , as well as hirschhorn in @xcite to obtain mapping spaces .",
    "alternatively one could try to find conditions under which a model category is quillen equivalent to a simplicial model category , as defined by quillen in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  ii.1 ) .",
    "this has been done by dugger in @xcite and rezk , shipley , and schwede in @xcite .",
    "these approaches however do not seem to emphasize the fundamental role of homotopy colimits and limits . in this context",
    "we should mention also the work of heller  @xcite .    since in our view",
    "hocolims and holims are so important , we need a suitable set up in which such constructions can be effectively studied .",
    "it turns out that for that purpose , instead of putting additional assumptions on a model category ( cellularity  @xcite , realization axiom  @xcite , etc ... ) , it is more advantageous to relax some of the requirements .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain the less restrictive approach of model approximations as introduced in  @xcite .",

    "these replacements can be used to construct derived functors .",

    "likewise one constructs the total left derived functor of left kan extensions , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  11.3(3 ) ) .",
    "these derived functors ( the homotopy colimits and the homotopy left kan extensions ) are related to each other by various properties . at a @xmath44-categorical level this has been formalized by cisinski in  @xcite and amounts to saying that the prederivator associated to any model category is a grothendieck derivator .",
    "the same applies to right model approximations .    to make the approach of model approximations viable we need one more thing .",
    "we need to show that a model approximation leads in a natural way to an action of @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of  @xcite was to introduce simple geometric techniques to study hocolims and holims .",
    "in this paper we are going to illustrate how to use these techniques further , which is what motivated us originally .",
    "we did not want to just state and prove some properties of mapping spaces , but more importantly we meant to explain an approach and provide coherent tools to study them .",
    "this will be illustrated by proving the following theorem ( see proposition  [ prop mapasadjoint ] and  [ prop homotopyadjoint ] ) :    * theorem .",
