    "we are interested in the following process indexed by this tree . along the edges of the tree",
    ", the process evolves as a cdlg strong markov process @xmath6 with values in a polish space @xmath7 and with infinitesimal generator @xmath8 of domain @xmath9 .",
    "the branching event is nonlocal : the states of the offspring are described by a function @xmath10 ,  , @xmath11 , which clearly depends on the state @xmath12 of the mother just before the branching event , and of the number @xmath13 of offspring ; besides , the randomness of these states are modelled _ via _ the random variable @xmath14 , which is uniform on @xmath15 $ ] . finally , the new born branches evolve independently from each other .",
    "this process is a branching markov process , for which there has been a vast literature .",
    "we refer to asmussen and hering @xcite , dawson @xcite and dawson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for nonlocal branching processes similar to those considered here .",
    "whereas the literature often deals with limit theorems that consider superprocesses limits corresponding to high densities of small and rapidly branching particles ( see dawson @xcite , dynkin @xcite , evans and steinsaltz @xcite ) , we stick here with the discrete tree in continuous time which we aim characterizing .",
    "let us also mention some results in the discrete time case .",
    "markov chains indexed by a binary tree have been studied in the symmetric independent case ( see athreya and kang @xcite , benjamini and peres @xcite ) , where for every @xmath12 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are i.i.d .",
    "a motivation for considering asymmetric branching comes from models for cell division .",
    "for instance , the binary tree can be used to describe a dividing cell genealogy in discrete time .",
    "the markov chain indexed by this binary tree then indicates the evolution of some characteristic of the cell , such as its growth rate , its quantity of proteins or parasites ... and depends on division events .",
    "experiments ( stewart @xcite ) indicate that the transmission of this characteristic in the two daughter cells may be asymmetric .",
    "see bercu @xcite or guyon @xcite for asymmetric models for cellular aging and bansaye @xcite for parasite infection .",
    "in delmas and marsalle @xcite a generalization of these models where there might be 0 , 1 or 2 daughters is studied . indeed under stress conditions",
    ", cells may divide less or even die . the branching markov chain , which in their case represents the cell s growth rate ,",
    "is then restarted for each daughter cell at a value that depends on the mother s growth rate and on the total number of daughters .",
    "we investigate the continuous time case and allow both asymmetry and random number of offspring .",
    "let us give two simple examples of this model for parasite infection .",
    "in the first case , the cell divides in two daughter cells after an exponential time and a random fraction of parasites goes in one of the daughter cell , whereas the rest goes in the second one . in the second case , the cell divides in @xmath18 daughter cells and the process @xmath19 is equally shared between each of the @xmath18 daughters : @xmath20 notice that another similar model has been investigated in evans and steinsaltz @xcite where the evolution of damages in a population of dividing cells is studied , but with a superprocess point of view .",
    "the authors assume that the cell s death rate depends on the damage of the cell , which evolves as a diffusion between two fissions .",
    "when a division occurs , there is an unbalanced transmission of damaged material that leads to the consideration of nonlocal births .",
    "further examples are developed in section [ sectionexamples ] .",
    "our main purpose is to characterize the empirical distribution of this process .",
    "more precisely , if we denote by @xmath21 the size of the living population @xmath22 at time @xmath0 , and if @xmath23 denotes the values of the markov process for the different individuals of @xmath22 , we will focus on the following probability measure which describes the state of the population @xmath24 this is linked to the value of the process of an individual chosen uniformly at time @xmath0 , say @xmath25 , as we can see from this simple identity : @xmath26={{\\mathbb e}}\\big[{{\\bf 1}}_{\\{n_t>0\\}}f(x^{u(t)}_t)\\big].\\ ] ] we show that the distribution of the path leading from the ancestor to a uniformly chosen individual can be approximated by means of an _ auxiliary markov process _",

    "the auxiliary process has the same generator as the markov process running along the branches , plus jumps due to the branching .",
    "however , we can observe a bias phenomenon : the resulting jump rate @xmath33 is equal to the original rate @xmath30 times the mean offspring number @xmath34 and the resulting offspring distribution is the size - biased distribution @xmath35 . for @xmath32 for instance , this is heuristically explained by the fact that when one chooses an individual uniformly in the population at time @xmath0 , an individual belonging to a lineage with more generations or with prolific ancestors is more likely to be chosen .",
