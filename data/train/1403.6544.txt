    "solar energetic particles ( seps ) encounter small - scale irregularities during transport in the large scale interplanetary magnetic field .",
    "the particles are scattered by the irregularities whose scales are comparable to the particles gyro radius .",
    "the parallel diffusion is produced by the pitch angle scattering , while the perpendicular diffusion is caused by crossing the local field line or following magnetic field lines randomly walking in space .",
    "low - rigidity particles tend to follow more tightly along individual field lines , whereas high - rigidity particles can cross local field lines more easily . as a result ,",
    "the perpendicular diffusion of lower rigidity particles is generally smaller than that of high - rigidity particles .",
    "the diffusion coefficients of seps depend on the magnetic turbulence in the solar wind .",
    "jokipii ( 1966 ) was the first to use the quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) to calculate particle diffusion coefficients from magnetic turbulence spectrum .",
    "but later it was found that the observed particle mean free paths are usually much larger than the qlt results derived from a slab magnetic turbulence @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the slab model is not a good approximation to describe the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) turbulence because there is also a stronger two - dimensional ( 2d ) component .",
    "@xcite showed that with a ratio of turbulence energy between slab and 2d components , @xmath2 , the qlt was able to derive a parallel mean free path much better in agreement with observations .",
    "however , the perpendicular diffusion remained a puzzle for many years .",
    "it is shown that the particles perpendicular diffusion model of field line random walk ( flrw ) based on qlt has difficulty to describe spacecraft observations and numerical simulations .",
    "recently , the non - linear guiding center theory ( nlgc ) @xcite was developed to describe the perpendicular diffusion in magnetic turbulence .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient from the nlgc theory agrees quite satisfactorily with numerical simulations of particle transport in typical solar wind conditions .",
    "observations by the ace and wind spacecraft show that there are rapid temporal structures in the time profiles of @xmath3 kev nucleon@xmath4 to @xmath5 mev nucleon@xmath4 ions during impulsive sep events .",
    "the phenomenon is commonly known as `` dropouts '' or `` cutoffs '' in some cases . in the dropouts ,",
    "the particle intensities exhibit short time scale ( about several hours ) variations , whereas , the cutoffs are referred to as some special dropouts in which the intensities suddenly decrease without recovery .",
    "they do not seem to be associated with visible local magnetic field changes @xcite .",
    "contrarily to the previous studies , by performing a detailed analysis of magnetic field topology during sep events , @xcite identified magnetic structures associated with sep dropouts . found that sep dropouts are generally associated with magnetic boundaries which represent the borders between adjacent magnetic flux tubes while @xcite , using the grad - shafranov reconstruction , identified flux ropes or current sheet associated with sep maxima . the dropouts and cutoffs can be interpreted as a result of magnetic field lines that connect or disconnect the observer alternatively to the sep source on the sun .",
    "however , with perpendicular diffusion , particles can cross the field lines as they propagate in the interplanetary space .",
    "a strong enough perpendicular diffusion can efficiently diminish longitudinal gradients of fluxes .",
    "the dropouts and cutoffs provide a good chance for us to estimate the level of perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space .    in an effort to interpret the sep dropouts , @xcite did a simulation of test particle trajectory in a model with random - walking magnetic field lines using newton - lorentz equation to study seps dropouts .",
    "it was found that the phenomenon is consistent with random - walking magnetic field lines .",
    "in addition , it was found from their simulations that , particle perpendicular diffusion relative to the parker spiral due to the field line random walk can be significant , and the ratio of perpendicular diffusion to the parallel one relative to the parker spiral can be as large as @xmath6",
    ". however , their perpendicular diffusion coefficients relative to the background magnetic field ( instead of parker spiral ) could still be very small , so dropouts can be obtained .",
    "recently , using the same technique as in @xcite , @xcite found that in some condition , dropouts can be reproduced in the foot - point random motion model , but no dropout is seen in the slab + 2d model . in @xcite , the large scale magnetic field is assumed to be a parker spiral , and the observer is located at @xmath0 au equatorial plane . at the start",
    "the observer is connected to the source region , and leaves the region after some time due to the effect of co - rotation .",
    "based on a numerical solution of the focused transport equation , they found that in order to reproduce cutoffs , the @xmath7 should be as small as a few times of @xmath8 . in the turbulence view , some other mechanisms @xcite are also proposed to interpret the dropout phenomenon .    in this work ,",
    "we use a fokker - planck focused transport equation to calculate the transport of seps in three - dimensional parker interplanetary magnetic field .",
    "we intend to put constraints on the conditions of the perpendicular and parallel diffusion coefficients for observing the sep dropouts and cutoffs . in section 2",
    "we describe our sep transport model . in section",
    "3 simulation results are presented . in section 4",
    "the simulation results are discussed , and conclusions based on our simulations are made .",

    "this equation includes many important particle transport effects such as particle streaming along field line , adiabatic cooling , magnetic focusing , and the diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the imf .",

    "with perpendicular diffusion , particles can be detected even if the observer is not connected directly to region 1 by field lines .",
    "the observer detects enhancements of particles starting at nearly @xmath70 day after the particles are injected on the sun . with a larger perpendicular diffusion ,",

    "it should be noted that in our model , the large scale magnetic field is assumed to be a parker spiral so that the fokker - planck focused transport equation can be solved efficiently with our stochastic method . in reality , the magnetic field lines with randomly walking foot - point do not have an azimuthal symmetry .",
    "however the large - scale geometry of interplanetary magnetic field and the behaviours of particle transport in it are not much different from those with a parker magnetic field .",
    "the only difference is a slight shift of sep source location relative to the magnetic field line passing through the observation at 1 au .",
    "some special sets of turbulence parameters are needed in our simulations to produce small perpendicular diffusion coefficients in order to produce the dropouts and cutoffs .",
    "for example , turbulence dominated by a slab component leads to very small perpendicular diffusion coefficients . in the future",
    ", it will be interesting for us to study solar wind turbulence geometry from spacecraft observations when sep dropouts and cutoffs occur .",

    "<S> this paper investigates the conditions for producing rapid variations of solar energetic particle ( sep ) intensity commonly known as `` dropouts '' . in particular , we use numerical model simulations based on solving the focused transport equation in the 3-dimensional parker interplanetary magnetic field to put constraints on the properties of particle transport coefficients both in the direction perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations of the temporal intensity profile of 0.5 and 5 mev protons at the earth show that the perpendicular diffusion must be small enough while the parallel mean free path should be long in order to reproduce the phenomenon of sep dropouts . </S>",
    "<S> when the parallel mean free path is a fraction of 1 au and the observer is located at @xmath0 au , the perpendicular to parallel diffusion ratio must be below @xmath1 , if we want to see the particle flux dropping by at least several times within three hours . </S>",
    "<S> when the observer is located at a larger solar radial distance , the perpendicular to parallel diffusion ratio for reproducing the dropouts should be even lower than that in the case of 1 au distance . </S>",
    "<S> a shorter parallel mean free path or a larger radial distance from the source to observer will cause the particles to arrive later , making the effect of perpendicular diffusion more prominent and sep dropouts disappear . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects require that the magnetic turbulence that resonates with the particles must be low everywhere in the inner heliosphere . </S>"
