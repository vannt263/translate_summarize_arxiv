    "complex networks of dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and science , as well as in engineering and technology . when control to a network is taken into consideration , the controllability of the network is essential , which is a classical concept @xcite applicable to multi - variable control systems @xcite , composite systems @xcite and decentralized control systems @xcite , etc .",
    "the subject of system controllability has been extensively studied over the last half a century .",
    "to date , various criteria have been well developed , including different kinds of matrix rank conditions and substantial graphic properties @xcite .",
    "one closely - related subject is the controllability of multi - agent systems , including the controllability of consensus systems @xcite , formation @xcite , and pinning strategies @xcite .",
    "noticeably , many existing results on controllability are derived under the assumption that the dimension of the state of each node is one @xcite .",
    "however , most real - world networks of dynamical systems have higher - dimensional node states , and many multi - input / multi - output ( mimo ) nodes are interconnected via multi - dimensional channels . in this paper",
    "we study the controllability of networked higher - dimensional systems with higher - dimensional nodes mainly for the mimo setting .    in the literature ,",
    "few results are developed for the controllability of networked higher - dimensional systems .",
    "controllability and observability of specified cartesian product networks are investigated in @xcite , while a general networked system is considered in @xcite with every subsystem subject to external control input .",
    "it should be noted that some recent studies have addressed consensus controllability of networks with mimo nodes @xcite , where the controllability usually can be decoupled into two independent parts : one is about the controllability of each individual node and the other is solely determined by the network topology .",
    "a general setting of complex dynamical networks _ can not _ be decoupled , however , as will be seen from the discussions below .",
    "this paper addresses networked mimo lti dynamical node - systems in a directed and weighted topology , where there is no requirement for every subsystem to have an external control input .",
    "some controllability conditions on the network topology , node dynamics , external control inputs and inner interactions are developed , so that effective criteria can be obtained for determining the large - scale networked system controllability .",
    "on one hand , some necessary and sufficient conditions on the controllability of a networked system with siso higher - dimensional nodes are derived . on the other hand ,",
    "some interesting results on the controllability of a networked system with mimo nodes are obtained : 1 ) under some mild conditions , controllability and observability of the nodes together are necessary for the controllability of the networked systems but , nevertheless , they are not sufficient ; 2 ) the controllability of the network topology is necessary for the controllability of the generated networked system ; 3 ) the controllability of individual node is necessary for the controllability of chain - networks , but not necessary for cycle - networks ; 4 ) interactions among the states of different nodes play an important role in determining the controllability of a general networked system .",
    "surprisingly , for the same network topology with the same node systems , the interactions among the states of nodes not only can lead controllable nodes to form an uncontrollable networked system , but also can assemble uncontrollable nodes into a controllable networked system .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ networked system ] , some preliminaries and the general model of networked mimo lti systems are presented .",
    "controllability conditions on various networked systems are investigated in section [ main ] .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn with some discussions in section [ conclusion ] .",

    "as reviewed for a directed graph in @xcite , a matching is a set of edges that do not share any common tail or head , and a node being the head of an edge in the matching is called a matched node ; otherwise , it is an unmatched node .",
    "a maximum matching is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges in the graph .",
    "a perfect matching is a matching which matches all nodes in the graph .",
    "a graph formed by a sequence of edges @xmath18 with no repeated node is called a path , denoted as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the beginning and @xmath21 is the end of the path , and @xmath21 is said to be reachable from @xmath20 . if @xmath19 is a path , then the graph formed by adding the edge @xmath22 is a cycle .",
    "a graph without cycles is called a tree .",
    "the node in a tree which can reach every other node is called the root of the tree .",
    "a leaf in a rooted tree is a node of degree 1 that is not the root .",
    "specifically , the notion of system controllability includes state controllability and structural controllability . for an @xmath4-dimensional system @xmath23 , it is said to be _ state controllable _ , if it can be driven from any initial state to the origin in finite time by a piecewise continuous control input .",

    "then , this networked system can be rewritten in a compact form as [ 2.4 ] = x+ u , with [ 2.5 ] = i_na+lhc,=b .    in this paper , the focus is on how the network topology ( described by the matrix @xmath42 ) , the node - system @xmath43 , the external control input ( determined by the matrix @xmath44 ) , and the inner interactions specified by @xmath45 affect the controllability of the whole networked system .      in @xcite , it is shown that a network is structurally controllable if and only if there is an external input on each unmatched node and there are directed paths from controlled nodes with input signals to all matched nodes .",
    "for the networked system - formed by nodes with higher - dimensional state vectors , however , its controllability can be much more complicated , as demonstrated by the following example .",
    "[ exadd2 ] consider a network of three identical nodes , with @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",

    ". however , based on the results from subsection [ tree ] below , one knows that the networked system is uncontrollable for any matrix @xmath13 , although it is structurally controllable due to the existence of self - matched cycle in every mimo node .",

    "however , these networked systems have very different controllabilities",
    ". the interactions among the states of nodes not only can lead controllable nodes to form an uncontrollable network , but also can assemble uncontrollable nodes into a controllable network .",
