    "the large-@xmath0 limit @xcite , while sharing several qualitative characteristics with qcd , exhibits significant simplifications . for this reason ,",
    "it is a very popular technique for qualitative and semi - quantitative estimates of crucial qcd observables .",
    "for instance , the string - gauge correspondence is profoundly intertwined with the large @xmath0 limit , since one of the requirements for a calculable dual holographic description is large @xmath0 @xcite .    yet",
    ", the existence of a smooth limit between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a conjecture which , for some observables , is _ known _ to be false . we know that , at zero chemical potential , @xmath3 and finite @xmath4 deconfinement has to be a phase transition . at @xmath5 lattice qcd seems to indicate it is a cross - over @xcite . at finite chemical potential , in the confining phase , nuclear matter is known to be a strongly bound crystal in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",
    "it seems to be a liquid at @xmath1 .",
    "this means that , before predictions made at large @xmath0 can be made qualitatively reliable , the phase diagram in @xmath6 space needs to be explored .",
    "the most current phenomenological application for these ideas is the existence of the so - called `` quarkyonic matter '' @xcite .",
    "this talk explores these ideas , summarizing @xcite and drawing connections between these works .",
    "our first investigation of these issues @xcite is to use the van der waals ( vdw ) ansatz to see under what conditions can we obtain both the familiar nuclear matter phase diagram at @xmath1 and the commonly accepted large @xmath0 phase diagram at @xmath7 @xcite . while the van der waals gas is certainly a very rough description , it is part of a universality class , to which the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition seems to belong .    in the large @xmath0 limit ,",
    "the only @xmath0-invariant scale of the theory is @xmath8 , the scale at which the t hooft coupling constant becomes @xmath9 . while a precise value of this scale depends on the scheme used to calculate it , its roughly @xmath10 mev @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that any physical quantity is @xmath11 , a dimensionless function of @xmath0 times a power of @xmath8 set by the dimensionality @xmath12 of the quantity .",
    "henceforward we shall adopt this assumption , and , for brevity , set @xmath8 to unity in the equations . in this notation ,",
    "the van der waals parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the curvature correction become dimensionless @xmath15,@xmath16,@xmath17 times the appropriate power of @xmath8 ( 3 for @xmath15,2 for @xmath16,4 for @xmath17 ) , and the vdw equation becomes @xmath18 we start by noting that , naturally , @xmath15 can only go to @xmath19 at @xmath7 , and is significantly larger than @xmath19 at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant to be determined .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 should , according to @xcite go as @xmath0 .",
    "recent work @xcite , however , has cast doubt on this assumption and proposed they go as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "the chemical potential can be obtained by the textbook thermodynamic relation @xmath25 .",
    "inverting , and writing in terms of @xmath26 we have @xmath27\\ ] ] where the first term is the nucleon mass and @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the density at the phase transition , which could be liquid @xmath31 or gas @xmath32 ( if the calculation is performed correctly the same chemical potential should come out ) .",
    "@xmath33 are in turn the solutions to the equation [ vdw ] in the region where this equation has two solutions ( of which one is thermodynamically unstable ) .",
    "obtaining all such solutions is trivial at the mathematical level through algebraically cumbersome .",
    "the reader can get the detailed results in @xcite .    as can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ phasemu ] ) , to interpolate between the currenlty accepted nuclear liquid phase diagram at @xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) and the `` quarkyonic '' phase diagram at @xmath7 ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 must be used .",
    "how would we interpret physically such a value ?",
    "above all , what is the physical meaning of @xmath21 ?",
    "we conjecture that @xmath21 tracks another dimensionless scale relevant at high density : the number of neighbors a nucleon has in a tightly packed nuclear material .",
    "@xmath21 , of course , is a function not of @xmath0 , but the ( fixed ) number of dimensions @xmath12 and `` packing scheme '' .",
    "the sensitivity of the varying @xmath0 equation of state to @xmath21 is undestandable due to the quantum nature of the problem and the fermionic nature of the quarks .",
    "the more neighbors , the more pauli blocking of valence quarks must be important , and the more the presence of neighbors will disturb the configuration space part of the quark wavefunction inside the nucleons . since , due to the uncertainty principle , any such disturbance of the nuclear wavefunction adds an energy of the order of the confinement scale @xmath37 , the nuclear repulsive core will be larger than the inverse of the nuclear separation up to the deconfinement temperature . if the number of colors is larger than @xmath21 , this problem will not exist since it will be possible to arrange the color part of the wavefunction so the nearest quarks of neighboring baryons will be of different colors . in this limit",
    "baryons can be tightly packed ( interbaryonic separation @xmath37 ) without the configuration space part of the baryonic wavefunction being disturbed .",

    "we investigate this possibility .",
    "the key insight suggesting that interesting structures might be lurking in @xmath0 is that 3d bond - percolation exhibits a phase transition at comparatively low critical link probability : for instance , @xmath42 for simple - cubic , body - centered - cubic and hexagonal - close - packed lattice , respectively @xcite .",
    "such values suggest that long - distance correlations on the quark level could occur even with a somewhat low percentage of quarks hopping between baryons , i.e.  firmly in the confined phase . while below @xmath43 the characteristic correlation distance @xmath44 ( @xmath45 cluster size ) is @xmath46 , above the threshold this quantity explodes to the total system size in a comparable amount of time .",
    "we leave the meaning of `` correlation '' vague , as it can be either a quark hop or a gluon exchange ; in our context , it implies exchange of colour degrees of freedom within a confined tightly packed medium .",
    "we encode the likelihood of exchange between neighbouring baryons in a link probability @xmath47 , to be compared with the percolation threshold @xmath43 in order to assess the formation of large - scale structures .",
    "two baryons will be correlated if _",
    "at least two _ quarks are correlated .",
    "one has to sum over all possible multi - quark configurations , resulting in a strong @xmath0-dependence of @xmath47 .",
    "we determine the latter by calculating the probability @xmath48 that _ no _ exchanges happen between neighbouring baryons . assuming the quarks inside the nucleon are uncorrelated ( fermi motion dominates )",
    ", this probability factorises into a geometric distribution @xmath49 for quarks to be at a certain ( vector ) position @xmath50 , and a `` squared propagator '' transition amplitude @xmath51 for them : @xmath52 we assume a `` hard - sphere '' distribution for @xmath53 ( since we keep @xmath54 fixed , the distance between centres of neighbouring baryons is always @xmath55 ) @xmath56 and a probability of exchange @xmath57 based on a range of `` reasonable '' propagators , compatible with confinement ( fast fall - out in configuration space at distances greater than @xmath58 in units of @xmath59 ) and with the large @xmath0 limit of qcd , the interaction is @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the propagators we use are the simple @xmath61-function in configuration space and the momentum - space @xmath61-function used in @xcite , all normalised so their area is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the range of propagation ( @xmath46 ) . in configuration space",
    "the transition amplitudes are , respectively , @xmath64 other transition amplitudes , such as a gaussian distribution in configuration space , were also tried with no significant modifications .",
    "this is unsurprising since , due to the fact that 3d percolation has a second - order phase transition at a certain @xmath65 , the results we obtain below have some degree of universality : as long as the qualitative features of confinement are observed ( the transition amplitude @xmath66 drops sharply above the scale @xmath63 , and the hadron density profile @xmath49 has a central plateau of radius @xmath46 and a sharply decreasing tail outside ) , the results we show vary quantitatively but not qualitatively .",
    "the crucial parameter left is @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ ptotlink ] .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath68 is in contradiction with the skyrme crystal picture at large @xmath0 : in this picture , @xmath69 approaches a constant large-@xmath0 value _ from above _ : _",
    "low @xmath0 _ nuclear matter would be more correlated ( and hence more strongly bound ) than _ high @xmath0 _ nuclear matter . comparing strongly coupled @xmath7 nuclear matter @xcite to the weakly bound nuclear liquid at @xmath1 @xcite ,",
    "this is obviously not right .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath70 henceforward , natural if the link is actually realised by a gluon exchange rather than a quark flip ( it is obvious this does indeed dominate at large @xmath0 ) .    in the large @xmath0 limit for the case @xmath70 ,",
    "@xmath47 asymptotically approaches unity .",
    "it is reasonable that this is the point where the `` dense baryonic matter as a skyrme crystal '' , theorised in @xcite , is reached . if this is the case , however , one should remember that a percolation second - order phase transition occurs at a @xmath71 .",
    "hence , keeping @xmath72 fixed but varying @xmath0 , the features of the skyrme crystal should manifest not with a continuous approach , rather as a second order transition at a not too high @xmath0 , whose order parameter can be though to be the `` giant cluster '' density . below the critical @xmath0",
    "there is little correlation between quarks of different baryons , while above this threshold they can correlate , with the distance boundary given only by causality .",
    "we reiterate that this is _ not _ deconfinement since @xmath73 independently of the number of colours , and the _ fraction _ of correlated quarks from different hadrons is still @xmath74 at the percolation transition . right above this transition , therefore , the baryonic wavefunction should _ not _ be too different from the large-@xmath0 baryonic wavefunction described in @xcite .",
    "the _ correlation distance _ of quarks will however be much larger than the baryon size .",
    "the features of this new phase are therefore similar to those of the quarkyonic matter @xcite .    assuming the lowest 3d value @xmath75 , appropriate for a closely packed hexagonal lattice , the critical number of colours is shown in fig .",
    "[ lottini ] as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath63 . as can be seen ,",
    "the critical number of colours is significantly larger than three for @xmath77 . considering fig .",
    "[ lottini ] is a _ lower limit _ since @xmath43 is at its minimum ( @xmath43 is significantly higher both in a skyrme cubic crystal and in a disordered fluid ) , we can say that @xmath1 is disfavoured , although it can not be excluded .",
    "changing temperature and @xmath54 should further change the critical @xmath0 .",
    "exploring this parameter space , and seeing how it relates to the confinement phase transition , is the subject of a forthcoming work .",
    "what are the phenomenological consequences of percolation ? if by `` correlation '' we mean energy - momentum - exchange via quark tunneling between baryons , it is reasonable that pressure and entropy density @xmath41 above the percolation threshold , while below it they stay @xmath23 .",
    "this is because above the threshold , where interbaryon tunnelling is significant , `` typical '' excitations of the fermi surface will be superpositions across baryons of baryon - localized quark - hole excitations , similar of conduction band electrons in a metal ; while the localized excitation energy @xmath78 , the superposition makes its energy @xmath37 even if color degeneracy remains .",
    "thus , the degrees of freedom of the system above percolation will be delocalized weakly interacting quarks in a lattice of confining potentials , a picture compatible with @xcite . below the threshold , where tunnelling is negligible",
    ", excitations are either color singlets or of energy @xmath79 , suppressed below deconfinement .",
    "the transitions discussed here might also be visible with holographic techniques _ beyond _ the supergravity limit , since finite @xmath80 corresponds , in gauge / string duality , to the string coupling constant @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "thus , a transition at finite @xmath0 will manifest itself as a transition between a classical supergravity regime and a quantum - gravitational regime .",
    "since gravity to one loop still has not been solved for backgrounds dual to confining theories , we can not rigorously say anything further .",
    "however , in @xcite , we have made a first step in that direction using the reasonable ansatz , developed earlier @xcite , that the effect of quantum gravity corrections is to smoothen the black hole singularity to a gaussian of with @xmath82 , the plank length .",
    "the problem of the first order quantum black hole reduces , than , to the problem of the classical general relativity sourced by a gaussian distribution of energy density @xmath29 .",
    "the top energy - momentum tensor is then @xmath83 with the other components of @xmath84 being fixed by isotropy , the classical einstein equation @xmath85 and conservation laws ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "thermodynamics can be obtained by the usual relationship between the entropy @xmath87 and the horizon area @xmath88 , @xmath89 , as well as maxwell s relations @xcite .",
    "we rely on @xcite for details on solving this problem , and connecting it to the hawking - page phase transition @xcite , and just give the result : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the free - energy of a classical black hole in ads space @xcite and @xmath92    once we examine the minimum structure of this free energy , we find a critical point : for a `` critical '' @xmath93 there is a critical point after which the hawking - page phase transition becomes a _",
    "cross - over _ ( fig .",
    "[ nicolini ] ) . the resulting phase diagram ( in @xmath94 vs @xmath82 )",
    "is shown to be in the universality class of the van der waals gas .",
    "the relevance of this paper to the topic at hand becomes apparent given that the hawking - page transition is thought to be dual to the deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "we know that at finite @xmath95 , deconfinement becomes a cross - over rather than a transition .",
    "thus , this calculation can be thought of as an estimate of the critical @xmath95 for the deconfinement critical point in two - dimensions ( since the gravitatational setup is in 3d ) .",
    "while the @xmath96 case presented here is considerably different from the @xmath97 or the @xmath98 background examined in @xcite , our results fall neatly into the van der waals universality class . because of that",
    ", and the structure of the calculations in the previous section , we expect that the general structure of this phase diagram will be maintained in @xmath97 or any other background where a deconfinement phase transition exists .",
    "the critical @xmath99 will of course be different , but not the behavior around the critical point .",
    "this critical point will translate itself in the behaviour of @xmath0 of the boundary theory , once again in a way that is universal around the critical point but sensitive to the exact nature of the background theory .",
    "when the number of colors @xmath100 the number of flavors @xmath4 ( the so - called thooft limit ) , confinement is rigorously known to be a phase transition in all dimensions greater than one , since the symmetries of the system are expected to change .",
    "the low temperature phase will have acquired an extra @xmath101 symmetry , signifying a zero expectation value of the polyakov loop @xcite . in the high - temperature phase",
    "the polyakov loop will aquire a finite expectation value , and @xmath101 will be spontaneusly broken . in the gravity picture , this can be thought of as a manifestation of the widely - believed cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , the idea that any singularity in spacetime is surrounded by an event horizon ( and hence a discontinuity in the energy density at the boundary theory ) .",
    "since the existance of the black hole tracks the confining polyakov loop behaviour in @xcite , making confinement into a cross - over would mean smoothening the black hole singularity .",
    "this can only be done , eg , by our ansatz , for @xmath102 .    at finite number of flavors @xmath4 ,",
    "the @xmath101 symmetry is no longer exact at a fundamental level .",
    "hence , it is natural to expect that at some critical @xmath103 `` a critical point '' for deconfinement appears , where for higher @xmath0 deconfinement is a phase transition and for lower @xmath0 it is a crossover .",
    "this is indeed what emerges from lattice simulations @xcite in three dimensions with a finite number of flavors .",
    "the free energy with respect to the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath104 and energy @xmath105 is therefore of the form @xmath106 @xmath107 at the mixed phase is a function with two local minima , corresponding to the two phases .",
    "for high - enough @xmath95 , however , @xmath108 could destroy one of the minima and make the phase transition into a crossover .",
    "the van der waals form of the free energy eq .",
    "[ freen ] exactly parallels eq .",
    "[ freengauge ] , with the @xmath109 parameter playing the role of @xmath95 in a gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions ( since the bulk calculated here is 3 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "the free energy @xmath110 in units of the cosmological constant @xmath111 for the system in equilibrium as a function of the schwarzschild radius @xmath112 from top to bottom for , in terms of @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the dashed lines represent the critical case @xmath116 , while the dotted line is the classical hawking - page phase transition ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "see @xcite for details , height=207 ]",
    "the preceding three sections , at first sight , look like they deal with very different subjects .",
    "indeed , the current status is that any correlation between them is conjectural .",
    "when @xmath0 is varied in the dense matter strongly coupled regime , deviations from the `` classical '' skyrme crystal arise due to the interplay between the number of colors and the number of neighbours @xmath21 in the densely packed system .",
    "this `` geometrical '' picture is explored rigorously , in terms of an analytical model , in section [ seclottini ] and shown to give a percolation - type phase transition .",
    "a similar behaviour can be argued in terms of the pauli exclusion principle , and if _ it is assumed _ , as shown in section [ secmishustin ] , leads to the transition between the loosely - bound nuclear liquid at @xmath1 and the tightly bound nucelar crystal at @xmath118 . since the solid - liquid transition can be understood as a percolation of crystal bonds @xcite , it is therefore compelling to identify the percolation transition with the physics described in section [ secmishustin ] , with the critical @xmath0 playing the role of `` critical point '' in @xmath6 space ( the transition in section [ seclottini ] is necessarily second order ) .",
    "the connection with the hawking - page transition described in section [ secnicolini ] is , at the moment , not so clear .",
    "it is worth pointing out , however , that this transition is also in the van der waals universality class .",
    "while section [ secnicolini ] was at zero chemical potential ( the black hole was not charged ) , the hawking - page phase diagram for classical ( @xmath119 ) charged black holes also falls into this class @xcite .",
    "thus , the phenomena examined at finite chemical potential in section [ seclottini ] and [ secmishustin ] might be analogous to the dynamics examined in section [ secnicolini ] at zero chemical potential .",
    "the closeness of the critical @xmath99 to the critical number of @xmath120 required for percolation in 2d @xcite ( 6 colors per flavor ) is in this sense intriguing .",
    "physically , in @xmath96 , the hawking - page transition coincides with the transition from a gas of black holes to one large black hole .",
    "it is plausible that the critical point to a hawking - page cross - over occurs because the black holes in the gas are actually linked by super - horizon quantum gravitational interactions , modeled in our approach by `` smearing '' the super - horizon black hole distance by a planck - sized width . in this scenario ,",
    "the connection of percolation to the cross - over in deconfinement is straight - forward . before this connection",
    "can be made more rigorous , however , a gauge / string setup where percolation is relevant must be examined with a `` smearing '' analogous to section [ secnicolini ] .",
