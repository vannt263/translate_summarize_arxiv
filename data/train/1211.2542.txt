    "a thermodynamic system may undergo a phase transition when temperature and/or pressure vary .",
    "for the strong interacting qcd system , it is known that the hadronic matter will change to partonic phase at very high temperature and density  @xcite .",
    "the data from ultra - relativistic nuclear - nuclear collisions at rhic has shown that the partonic phase of qcd matter ",
    "quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been formed  @xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of current ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments is to map the qcd phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the critical point at the qcd phase boundary is particular interested , as the large fluctuations are expected .",
    "the sensitive probes of qcd critical point are the high cumulants of the conserved charges , i.e. , net baryon number , net electric charge , and net strangeness  @xcite .",
    "the net baryon number fluctuations have been studied using lattice qcd simulations and qcd effective models  @xcite . however , due to the difficulties of the lattice calculations and model estimations , the high cumulants of the net baryon number are still not final  @xcite .",
    "the universality of the critical fluctuations allows us to study the relevant cumulants in a simple system , where the high cumulants can be precisely obtained .",
    "it is known that the qcd critical point , which terminates the first order phase transition line , is in the same universality class as the 3-dimensional ising model  @xcite .",
    "so the high cumulants of order parameter and energy in the vicinity of the critical point of the 3-dimensional ising model are called for .",
    "they should be a good reference for various relevant calculations .    in the chiral limit , the chiral phase transition for 2-flavor qcd belongs to the same universality class as the 3-dimensional @xmath3 spin model  @xcite .",
    "the singular behavior of the net baryon number fluctuations is expected to be governed by the universal @xmath3 symmetry group  @xcite .",
    "owing to the staggered fermions in lattice calculations , the ( 2 + 1)-flavor chiral phase transition may fall into the 3-dimensional @xmath2 universality class  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the high cumulants of the order parameter and energy in the vicinity of the critical temperature from the 3-dimensional ising model , and energy from the 3-dimensional @xmath2 and @xmath3 spin models , respectively .",
    "the simulation is performed in a finite - size system .",
    "the obtained results should be instructive to a finite system formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , firstly , the cumulants of the order parameter and energy from the @xmath4 spin models are derived in section ii .",
    "then , their relations to the net baryon number fluctuations in the qcd phase transitions are discussed . in section iii ,",
    "the high cumulants from the 3-dimensional ising , @xmath2 and @xmath3 spin models are presented and discussed .",
    "finally , the generic features of the cumulants from the three models are summarized in section iv .",
    "the @xmath4-invariant nonlinear @xmath5-models ( @xmath4 spin models ) are defined as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian , @xmath8 is an interaction energy between nearest - neighbor spins @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the external magnetic field . @xmath8 and @xmath10 are both reduced quantities which already contain a factor @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is a unit vector of @xmath13-components at site @xmath14 of a @xmath15-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice .",
    "it is usually decomposed into the longitudinal ( parallel to the magnetic field @xmath10 ) and the transverse component @xmath16 where @xmath17 . for the 3-dimensional ising , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 spin models , @xmath15 = 3 , and @xmath13 = 1 , 2 and 4 , respectively .    the ( reduced ) free energy per unit volume is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the partition function .",
    "@xmath20 is the energy of a spin configuration , @xmath21 is the lattice average of the longitudinal spin components , @xmath22 is the volume , and @xmath23 is the number of lattice points of each direction .    as we known , the cumulants of the order parameter are the derivatives of the free energy density ( eq .  ) with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "we can get the cumulants of the order parameter from the generating function  @xcite , @xmath25 so the first , second , third , fourth and sixth order cumulants of the order parameter are as follows , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the magnetization ( order parameter ) of the system . at vanishing external magnetic field , due to",
    "the spatial rotation symmetry of the @xmath4 groups , such defined order parameter is zero . in the case ,",
    "an approximated order parameter definition is suggested as , @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the cumulants of the energy are the derivatives of the free energy density with respect to the temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the generating function is @xmath31 so the first , second , third , fourth and sixth order cumulants of the energy are as follows , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .    in the vicinity of the critical point , the free energy density ( eq.([free energy density ] ) )",
    "can be decomposed into two parts , the regular and singular parts .",
    "the critical related fluctuations are determined by the singular part .",

    ", we set @xmath42 and choose the approximate critical temperatures , @xmath43  @xcite , @xmath44  @xcite , and @xmath45  @xcite for the 3-dimensional ising , @xmath2 and @xmath3 spin models , respectively .    in order to map the result of the 3-dimensional ising model to that of the qcd ,",
    "the following linear ansatz is suggested  @xcite , @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the temperature and chemical potential at the qcd critical point , respectively . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are two parameters determined by qcd .",
    "the baryon - baryon correlation length diverges with the exponent @xmath40 and exponent @xmath41 when the critical point is approached along the @xmath51-direction and @xmath52-direction , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the cumulants of the net baryon number are the derivatives of the qcd free energy density with respect to @xmath53 . in the vicinity of the critical point , it is the combination of the derivatives with respect to @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the 3-dimensional ising model .",
    "since @xmath41 is larger than @xmath40  @xcite , the critical behavior of the net baryon number fluctuations is mainly controlled by the derivatives with respect to @xmath52 , i.e. , the fluctuations of the order parameter in the 3-dimensional ising model .",
    "the singular part of the free energy density for the chiral phase transition is suggested as  @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the universal critical exponents of the 3-dimensional @xmath3 spin model .",
    "@xmath57 is the scaling function .",
    "the reduced temperature @xmath51 and external field @xmath52 are expressed as follows @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the critical temperature in the chiral limit .",
    "@xmath60 is a parameter determined by qcd  @xcite .",
    "the net baryon number susceptibility is the derivative of free energy density with respective to the chemical potential @xmath61 . from eqs .   and",
    ", we can get the derivatives of the free energy density with respect to @xmath30 , to chemical potential @xmath62 at @xmath63 , and to @xmath64 respectively , @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is even in eq .  .",
    "comparing eqs .   and with eq .",
    ", we can see that the scaling form of derivatives of the free energy density with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath61 are equivalent .",
    "so the net baryon number fluctuations are related to the derivatives of the free energy density with respect to @xmath30 in the 3-dimensional @xmath3 spin model .",
    "the @xmath68-th order cumulant of the energy from the 3-dimensional @xmath3 spin model is relevant to the @xmath69-th ( or @xmath68-th ) order cumulant of the net baryon number at @xmath70 ( or @xmath71 ) in the chiral phase transition .",
    "the cumulants of the order parameter from the 3-dimensional @xmath2 and @xmath3 spin models are the derivatives of the free energy density with respect to the external field .",
    "their critical behavior has been presented and discussed in ref .",
