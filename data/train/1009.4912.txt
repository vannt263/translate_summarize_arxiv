    "a vertical current sheet is expected to form above the flare loop when a closed magnetic structure is highly stretched in solar conditions @xcite .",
    "pieces of indirect evidence highly suggestive of such a reconnection geometry have accumulated over decades of observations @xcite .",
    "these include candlelight flare loops implying an x - type or y - type reconnection point above the cusp @xcite , high - temperature plasma along the field lines mapping to the tip of the cusp @xcite , loop shrinkage implying the relaxation of newly reconnected field lines @xcite , a hard x - ray ( hxr ) source above the soft x - ray loop top @xcite , upward - moving plasmoid @xcite and supra - arcade downflows @xcite implying reconnection outflows , horizontal converging motion above a cusp - shaped flare loop implying reconnection inflows @xcite , and a double coronal source morphology in hxrs implying the formation of a current sheet between the two sources @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable attention has been given to a coaxial , bright ray feature that appears several hours after some cmes @xcite .",
    "the flaring - time current sheet , however , has not been directly detected yet .    in this letter , we study a transequatorial loop system ( tls ) , whose eruption on 2004 july 29 resulted in a halo cme and a _",

    "most importantly , a bright elongated feature is observed to extend above a cusp - shaped flare loop during the impulsive phase , whose geometry and dynamics are highly suggestive of a reconnecting current sheet .",
    "the tls connected noaa ar 10652 to ar 10653 ( fig .  [ eit](a ) and ( b ) ) . during its disk passage",
    ", the tls was oriented primarily in the north - south direction , with the northern footpoints located to the east of the southern ones by @xmath2 . when rotated with the sun to the west limb ,",
    "the tls erupted as a halo cme associated with a flare at about 12:00 ut on 2004 july 29 , observed by the euv imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) .",
    "eit takes full - disk images at a pixel scale of @xmath3 pixel@xmath4 and 12-min cadence in a narrow bandpass centered on 195  ( fe  xii ; @xmath5 k ) .",
    "the 195  channel is also sensitive to high - temperature flare plasma @xcite , because of the presence of the fe  xxiv resonance line ( @xmath6192 ; @xmath7 k ) .",
    "in addition to the standard eit data processing , we have further removed the instrumental stray - light background , and enhanced the fine coronal structures in eit images with a wavelet method @xcite .",
    "the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ; * ? ? ? * ) on board _",
    "_ was also pointing at ar 10652 . a raster scan from 13:32 to 15:32",
    "ut covered the northern leg of the post - flare loop , despite the limited field of view ( fov ; @xmath8 ) of the raster images .",
    "the ensuing cme was observed in white - light by the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board soho , which consists of two optical systems , c2 ( 2.26.0 @xmath9 ) and c3 ( 432 @xmath9 ) .",
    "relevant radio emissions were recorded by the green bank solar radio burst spectrometer ( gbsrbs ) on the ground and the waves instrument on board the wind spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the tls that erupted on 2004 july 29 12:00 ut can be clearly seen to slowly rise from as early as 2004 july 28 21:12 ut . with",
    "footpoints being `` fixed '' on the extremely dense photosphere , the `` waist '' of the tls became thinner and thinner ( fig .",
    "[ eit](b)(c ) ) . by placing a slit across the waist ( fig .",
    "[ eit](b)(f ) ) , and then putting the resultant strips in chronological order ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ cartoon](b ) ) , one can see that initially the waist converged at @xmath101 km s@xmath4 , and then the speed suddenly increased to @xmath11 km s@xmath4 from 11:08 until 12:20 ut when a cusp - shaped flare loop formed ( fig .  [",
    "eit](d ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "meanwhile , from 11:30 till 13:30 ut , gbsrbs recorded drifting pulsating structures ( dpss ) at metric frequencies ( 3rd panel of fig .  [ cartoon](b ) ) , suggestive of the tearing of a current sheet ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon](a ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario ,",
    "electrons are accelerated and trapped as the plasmoids ( magnetic islands ) contract and mutually interact , probably in a classic fermi manner @xcite , which generate the individual pulses of the dpss ; motions of the plasmoids in the corona result in the global drift of the dpss . with reconnection sets in , we expect that the plasma near the reconnection region would be rapidly heated to flaring temperatures in excess of @xmath12 k , which would make the reconnection region a bright feature in euv lines of highly ionized lines , such as fe xxiv covered by the eit 195  filter .    indeed , at 12:20 ut ( fig .",
    "[ eit](d ) ) , a bright , collimated feature can be seen to extend from well above a cusp - shaped flare loop for 170 mm ( @xmath13 ) up to the border of the eit fov ( @xmath14 ) , indicating that the tls had been stretched to the point that the oppositely directed field lines at the waist were close enough to reconnect .",
    "the morphology is similar to that in the standard model @xcite , and the extended sheet structure favors a y - type @xcite over an x - type geometry @xcite .",
    "the sheet spans about 35 eit pixels , i.e. , ( 510)@xmath15 km .",
    "hence the observed thickness is not resolution - limited since the eit point spread functions are narrower than the pixel size of the ccd @xcite .",
    "however , projection effects could increase the apparent thickness by a factor of 24 @xcite .",
    "the ( inverse ) y - point , i.e. , the lower tip of the sheet , is above the cusp - shaped flare looptop by about 50 mm , with the height ratio of about 1.6 between the y - point and the looptop . from 12:08 to 12:32 ut , the lower tip of the sheet ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon](b  c ) ) moved toward the solar surface .",
    "meanwhile ( @xmath1612:23 ut ) , the wind spacecraft recorded a type iii burst ( 2nd panel of fig .",
    "[ cartoon](b ) ) , indicative of accelerated electrons beaming upward from the upper tip of the current sheet ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon](a ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can see from the radio spectrograms that the starting frequency of the type iii burst , @xmath17 . by exploiting the density profile known as the baumbach - allen formula @xcite , one obtains that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the heliocentric distance of the upper tip of the current sheet .",
    "the heliocentric distance of the lower tip , @xmath20 , is measured to be @xmath21 ; and the sheet orientation is deviant from the radial direction by @xmath22 , hence the sheet length , @xmath23 , can be estimated , i.e. , @xmath24 ( fig .  [ eit](g ) ) .",
    "the sheet and the cusp - shaped flare loop are visible probably due to the fe  xxiv emission ( @xmath25 ; @xmath7 k ) .",
    "both faded out quickly after the temporary appearance , presumably due to cooling .",
    "the flare loop reappeared at 13:09 ut at a lower altitude by about 17 mm , taking a relaxed shape ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ eit](f ) ) , above which appeared an emission - depressed , cusp - shaped region ( fig .  [ eit](e)(f ) ) .",
    "note that the bright loops apparently within the southern leg of the dimming region are not newly formed but relatively long - lived active - region loops of ar 10653 , which may be located in the foreground or background due to the optically thin nature of coronal lines .",
    "the eit cusp - shaped dimming is in emission in the hot fe  xvi line ( @xmath26 ; @xmath27 k ; top left panel of fig .",
    "[ doppler](b ) ) , while remaining dark in the cold o  v line ( @xmath28 ; @xmath29 k ; bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ doppler](b ) ) .",
    "clearly , the cusp - shaped region hosts newly reconnected flux tubes that later cooled and relaxed into the dipolar post - flare loops @xcite . velocity maps ( right column of fig .  [ doppler](b ) ) show that doppler redshifts dominate in the cusp - shaped region in fe  xvi , while blueshifts dominate in the post - flare arcade in o  v. this is because the flare - loop plane is tilted eastward by about @xmath30 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ doppler](a ) , hence upflows due to evaporated chromospheric plasma filling the newly reconnected flux tubes bear a velocity component away from the observer ( redshift ) at the northern leg of the cusp - shaped region ; meanwhile , downflows due to cooled plasma falling back along the relaxed field bear a velocity component toward the observer ( blueshift ) at the northern leg of the post - flare arcade . as an important consequence of the reconnection in the corona",
    ", the evaporation takes place when chorompospheic material is heated by precipitating nonthermal electrons or thermal conduction @xcite . both the cusp - shaped dimming and the underlying post - flare arcade expanded with time ( fig .",
    "[ eit](e)(f ) ) , implying reconnection proceeding to higher and higher altitudes @xcite .",
    "despite the low contrast , one can still get a sense of the orientation of the current sheet from the cusp morphology .",
    "it was apparently aligned with a post - cme ray feature observed in coronagraph ( top panels of fig .",
    "[ ray ] ) .",
    "the ray was seen to rapidly fan out above its upper tip ( fig .",
    "[ ray](b ) ) in a similar fashion as the vertical current sheet does in the models @xcite , which is not reported in previous observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a blob was observed to move outward along the ray at @xmath10360 km s@xmath4 ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ ray ] ) , implying the ejection of a plasmoid .",
    "these observations allow us to estimate the rate of magnetic reconnection , @xmath31 , given by the ratio between the inflow and the outflow speed @xcite . if we relate the ejected blob to the reconnection outflow @xcite , and assume that the reconnection inflow can be characterized by the converging of the loop waist ( fig .",
    "[ eit ] and the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ cartoon](b ) ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then @xmath320.010.02 , despite the caveat that the outflow is not simultaneous to the inflow .",
    "according to the steady reconnection theory @xcite , the sheet thickness @xmath33 for a diffusion region of length @xmath23 and width @xmath34 . with @xmath35 and @xmath360.010.02 , we find that @xmath37(515)@xmath1 km , in good agreement with the observed sheet thickness ( ( 510)@xmath1 km ) .",
    "the dissipation of the current sheet may help further accelerate the cme to a speed ( @xmath101300 km s@xmath4 ; top panel of fig .",
    "[ cartoon](b ) ) much faster than the one ( @xmath10400 km s@xmath4 ) when the current sheet was first detected .",
    "a follow - up paper is being prepared on more detailed properties of this reconnection region .",
    "the various reconnection signatures observed in this single event , including plasma inflow and outflow , an expanding cusp - shaped dimming , chromospheric evaporation , and the relevant radio emissions , constitute for the first time a comprehensive view of the reconnection dynamics in the solar corona . taking its formation , geometry and dynamics into account , we conclude that the bright , elongated euv feature observed above the cusp - shaped flaring loop is a y - type current sheet .",
    "this unique observation has several important implications .",
    "first of all , the y - type reconnection geometry together with the above dynamic features constitutes direct verification of the standard physical picture for flares / cmes @xcite , which has been invoked in other astrophysical phenomena beyond stellar flares , e.g. , episodic jets from black hole systems @xcite .",
    "second , the fact that the lower tip of the current sheet is located well above the cusp - shaped flare loop provides an unequivocal evidence that particle acceleration in solar flares occurs well above the flare loop .",
    "the reconnection geometry observed here agrees with an independent study of electron time - of - flight ( tof ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which a scaling law is found between the electron tof distance @xmath38 , indicating the height of the acceleration site , and the flare - loop half length @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 .",
    "third , the fact that the lower tip of the current sheet initially moved downward supports the conjecture that the descending motion of the flare looptop emission during the flare rising phase , which the standard flare model fails to explain , is due to the extending of a current sheet @xcite . in our case",
    ", the plasma inflows due to the stretch of the tls may bring in flux faster than the rate of dissipation . with the flux piling up",
    ", the diffusion region grows in length in both ( upward and downward ) directions until it reaches the global dimension ( @xmath9 ) and becomes subject to tearing @xcite .",
    "fourth , the imaging observation allows for a direct measurement of the thickness of the flaring - time current sheet .",
    "the measured width ( ( 510)@xmath1 km ) is an order of magnitude thinner than that of post - cme rays ( @xmath41 km ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , it agrees with the steady reconnection theory @xcite , and matches not only the width ( @xmath164@xmath1 km ) of high - speed outflows of hot plasma near a reconnection site , detected in euv spectra @xcite , but also the thickness ( ( 310)@xmath1 km ) of the heliospheric current sheet measured _ in situ _ @xcite .",
    "thus , we have obtained a tight upper limit to the `` true '' thickness of the current sheet in the solar corona .",
    "finally , the observation of a current sheet of global length and macroscopic width , which is associated with radio pulsations @xcite , supports recent theoretical studies which conclude that a single localized reconnection region can not account for the large number of energetic electrons typically seen in flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
