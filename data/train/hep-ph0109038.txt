    "factorization crucially depends on the presence of a large energy scale in the process , such as the space - like momentum transfer squared @xmath55 in leptoproduction . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with functions that appear in hard processes but which have , apart from such a hard scale , an additional soft momentum scale , related to the transverse momentum of the partons . in one - hadron inclusive leptoproduction such a scale is accessible because one deals with three momenta : the large momentum transfer @xmath14 , the target momentum @xmath13 and the momentum of the produced hadron @xmath56 .",

    "thus in that case one finds the two t - odd fragmentation functions  @xcite appearing as imaginary parts of the complex off - diagonal ( @xmath73-dependent ) functions in the matrix representation .",
    "the matrix corresponds for @xmath87 actually to a semi - definite quark decay matrix .",
    "the possibility to access the full ( transverse momentum dependent ) spin structure of the nucleon is in my opinion one of the most exciting possibilities offered by 1-particle inclusive leptoproduction .",
    "it requires measurements of azimuthal asymmetries , which for the leading cross sections often appear only in combination with spin asymmetries .",
    "the t - odd fragmentation functions play a special role since they appear in single - spin asymmetries .",
    "recent experimental results have clearly shown the presence of azimuthal asymmetries including single - spin asymmetries  @xcite    at measured @xmath57 one deals with a convolution of two transverse momentum dependent functions , where the transverse momenta of the partons from different hadrons combine to @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "a decoupling is achieved by studying cross sections weighted with the momentum @xmath88 , leaving only the directional ( azimuthal ) dependence . for the quark distribution and fragmentation functions this implies a weighing with the transverse momentum , which is also important for proper theoretical handling of the functions  @xcite .",
    "we give a few explicit examples .",
    "for that we define weighted cross sections such as d^2q_t ( 2_h^ ) _ ol , where the angle @xmath89 is the azimuthal angle between the hadron production plane and the lepton scattering plane .",
    "the subscripts @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are used to refer to polarization of lepton and target respectively .",
    "the subsequently used angle @xmath93 is the azimuthal angle between the transverse target spin vector and the lepton scattering plane .    for polarized targets ,",
    "several azimuthal asymmetries arise already at leading order .",

    "[ finalstate ] the latter two are single spin asymmetries involving the t - odd fragmentation function @xmath94 . the last one was the asymmetry proposed by collins  @xcite as a way to access the transverse spin distribution function @xmath34 in pion production .",
    "in the weighted cross sections , the socalled transverse moments show up , defined as f^(n)(x ) = d^2p_t()^n f(x , p_t ) .",
    "these transverse moments only depend on @xmath72 and are contained in @xmath95 which projects out the functions in @xmath96 where @xmath73 appears linearly , _",

    "to study the scale dependence we use the moments in both @xmath73 and @xmath72 of the @xmath73-dependent functions , employ lorentz invariance and use the qcd equations of motion .",
    "the moments in @xmath72 for leading ( collinear ) distribution functions ( appearing for instance in inclusive leptoproduction ) are related to matrix elements of twist two operators . on the other hand , for the transverse moments entering the azimuthal asymmetry expressions of interest",
    ", one finds relations to matrix elements of twist two _ and _ twist three operators , for which the evolution , however , is known . in the large @xmath1 limit",
    "this evolution becomes particularly simple .",
    "we first invoke lorentz invariance to rewrite some functions discussed so far .",
    "all functions in @xmath36 and @xmath97 involve nonlocal matrix elements of two quark fields . before constraining the matrix elements to the light - cone or lightfront",
    "only a limited number of amplitudes can be written down .",
