    "generally speaking , to determine either the temperature dependent thermal expansion or the field dependent magnetostriction of a sample , two sets of data are required : one with the sample installed in the dilatometer and one with a known reference material installed in the dilatometer ( we use ofhc copper ) .",
    "an expression relating these two data sets to the thermal expansion of the sample can be derived assuming that the distance between the inner flat surface of the fixed capacitor plate _",
    "a _ and the outer flat surface of the lower flange _ p _ depends upon temperature but is independent of the of the length or nature of the sample installed in the dilatometer . if the sample is of length @xmath1 and the reference material is copper ( or , more generally , the same material as the dilatometer ) , then one can show that    @xmath34 + \\alpha_{\\rm cu}\\left[1+\\frac{d_s - d_c}{l}\\right ] , \\label{eqn : cell_effect2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the capacitor gap when the copper standard is mounted in the dilatometer , @xmath36 is the gap when the sample is mounted , and @xmath37 is the thermal expansion of copper taken from the literature @xcite .",
    "first note that this result is independent of the length of the standard material used ( which follows from the standard being made of the same material as the dilatometer ) .",
    "second , for our cell operating near 18 pf and a sample of length @xmath38 mm , @xmath39 which may not be small enough to ignore , but if the two capacitances remain near 18 pf and differ by 1 pf then @xmath40 which may be small enough to ignore . if we drop the final term , eq .",
    "[ eqn : cell_effect2 ] can be expressed as    @xmath41    since @xmath42 . the first term on the right side of eq .",
    "[ eqn : cell_effect1 ] represents measurements with the sample installed in the dilatometer .",
    "the second term represents measurements with a copper standard installed in the dilatometer , this term is also known as the `` cell effect '' .",
    "although a conventional ofhc copper sample can be used as a standard , we use the sample platform itself by rotating it until its upper surface is pressed against the rounded point of the lower capacitor plate , the platform is then fixed in position with the lock - ring .",
    "we generally operate with the dilatometer set at about 5 pf greater than the zero - force capacitance ( about 18 pf and 13 pf respectively for the dilatometer used for most of the data presented in this paper ) .    if the sample has two appropriately positioned parallel faces it can be placed in the center of the sample platform which is then rotated until the sample is pressed against the rounded point of the lower capacitor plate as illustrated in fig .",
    "once the sample platform is secured with the lock - ring the sample may be gently rotated with tweezers .",
    "we have successfully mounted plate - like samples with only a single flat edge by grasping the sample with tweezers , holding the flat edge against the sample platform , and then rotating the sample platform until the irregular upper surface of the sample is lodged against the rounded point of the lower capacitor plate .",
    "( this sample mounting scheme was devised to accommodate thin , plate - like , rare - earth nickel - borocarbide crystals @xcite , crystals that frequently have irregularities on one or more surfaces . )",
    "one can use the dilatometer itself to measure the length of irregularly shaped samples after they have been loaded : the sample length @xmath1 will always be the distance that the sample platform is withdrawn relative to its position for the cell effect measurement .",
    "this distance can be measured with calipers or a micrometer .",
    "the precision of this measurement method can , in principle , be improved by incorporating the capacitances of the dilatometer for the two configurations , though we do not think that this approach will always be better than using high quality calipers or micrometers .",
    "the open architecture of the dilatometer means that the sample will be exposed to any black - body radiation illuminating the dilatometer from the side and that a portion of the capacitance circuit , connected to the lower capacitor plate , will not be completely shielded from electrical interference .",
    "we address both of these issues by surrounding the dilatometer ( and the cold finger on which it is mounted ) with a copper can that acts as both an electrical and a thermal shield .",
    "thermometers mounted on the cold finger of our @xmath12he refrigerator have always agreed with thermometers mounted on the bottom of the dilatometer within experimental resolution if the temperature is not changing too rapidly .",
    "we generally take isothermal magnetostriction data with the field changing at a maximum rate of 0.4 t / min . a small field and sample dependent hysteresis",
    "is generally observed in isothermal magnetostriction data ( about @xmath43 near 9 t and 10 k when sweeping the field at 0.3 t / min in measurements of the field dependent `` cell effect '' , see below ) .",
    "we attribute the hysteresis to magnetic forces acting on the eddy currents generated in the dilatometer and sample ( unless the sample is insulating ) by the changing magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic moments associated with these currents change sign as the field increases or decreases .",
    "forces arise because the field of our superconducting magnet is not perfectly uniform .",
    "the size of the hysteresis is therefore reduced as the field sweep slows ; slower field sweeps also reduce eddy current heating in the dilatometer . averaging isothermal data taken with the field increasing and decreasing yields a field dependence of the capacitor gap less than 1 over 9 t , a value consistent with data taken after changing the field and waiting a few seconds for the hysteretic signal to vanish .    for temperatures from about 20 to 300 k",
    "we usually take temperature - dependent data with @xmath7 increasing continuously at a rate of about 0.4 k / min or less . for our system , data taken while warming are generally less noisy than while cooling in this temperature range .",
    "however , one of us ( jcl ) , running an identical dilatometer in a commercial physical property measurement system , finds that data taken while the experimental region is continuously pumped and while cooling at 0.2 k / min are less noisy .",
    "the optimal data acquisition protocol in this temperature range can , as one might expect , vary from system to system .",
    "below about 20 k we keep to this rate ( or slower ) , but the warming and cooling data exhibit comparable levels of noise .",
    "we generally take data while the temperature is varying rather than stabilizing the temperature and then making the measurement because it requires less time to acquire and avoids small displacements that appear occasionally in the raw data .",
    "we believe these displacements are caused by the sudden relaxation of small strains in the dilatometer or sample being studied or from building vibrations , these events manifest as abrupt changes in the size of the capacitor gap @xmath2 ( on the order of 1 - 10  ) . such `` glitches '' are not uncommon @xcite and do not affect the slope of the nearby data ( from which the thermal expansion is determined , see below ) .",
    "however , should such an event occur between two data points acquired by first stabilizing the temperature and then measuring the capacitance ( instead of continuously monitoring the capacitance during the temperature change ) , the resulting slope would erroneously incorporate the displacement .",
    "the capacitance of the dilatometer is sensitive to thermal gradients : though constructed of high thermal conductivity copper , the electrical isolation separating parts of the capacitor circuit impedes heat flow .",
    "the effects of such gradients are apparent , for example , when warming or cooling the dilatometer rapidly . in such circumstances",
    "the capacitance data are offset in opposite `` directions '' from data taken either in equilibrium or with the temperature varying very slowly .",
    "the opposite signs of the temperature gradient across the dilatometer when warming or cooling causes an apparent shift in capacitance , qualitatively proportional to both the sign and magnitude of the thermal gradient . in steady state situations , however , the slopes of capacitance with respect to temperature are identical within experimental uncertainty as long as the warming or cooling is not too rapid . these effects can be mitigated , somewhat , if the dilatometer is surrounded by helium exchange gas ( though the dielectric constant of the exchange gas may have to be incorporated in the analysis ) .",
    "operating the dilatometer under liquid helium provides excellent thermal contact to the sample and dramatically reduces the thermal gradients across the dilatometer .",
    "however , the thermal expansion of the liquid helium ( either @xmath12he , @xmath44he , or @xmath12he-@xmath44he mixtures ) dominates the temperature dependence of the capacitance through the dielectric constant of the liquid . we have not yet made reliable thermal expansion measurements under liquid helium .    to characterize the resolution of the dilatometer under various operational conditions we first measured the dilatometer capacitance repeatedly over a period of about 30 minutes with two identical dilatometers , one held at 5.00 k in a commercial physical property measurement system @xcite surrounded by a small amount of helium exchange gas , and another held at 0.300 k in vacuum . in both cases",
    "the capacitance bridge averaging time was set to about 8 s. after converting the measured capacitances to capacitor gaps in a manner described above we found an rms deviation from the mean capacitor gap of 0.03 for the former dilatometer and 0.05 for the latter .",
    "when the latter dilatometer was warming at a rate of 0.4 k / min over a 2 k range near 20 k the rms deviation from a linear fit to the measurements was 0.04  , near 280 k the rms deviation was 0.11 (we believe this latter uncertainty could be reduced by using a thermometer more appropriate for this temperature range ) .",
    "a magnetically anisotropic sample in a magnetic field will experience a torque if its magnetic moment is not parallel to the field .",
    "any motion of the sample in response to this torque will contribute to the measured capacitance change .",
    "we believe we have seen this effect manifest as an irreproducibility in magnetostriction measurements after the sample has been removed from the dilatometer and subsequently reinstalled .",
    "we are exploring the use of thin films of glue or varnish to affix the sample to the sample platform , preventing it from responding to the magnetic torque .",
    "unfortunately the glue or varnish will also contribute to the thermal expansion , though if it is very thin its affects may be small enough to ignore .",
    "further work is underway on this issue .",
    "once the capacitance of the dilatometer has been measured as a function of temperature ( assuming , for example , that our goal is to determine the thermal expansion through evaluation of eq .",
    "[ eqn : cell_effect1 ] ) the next tasks are to convert the measured capacitances @xmath3 to capacitor gaps @xmath2 ( as described above ) and then to evaluate the derivatives of the resulting data with respect to temperature .     for the dilatometer with a copper standard ( solid line , the `` cell effect '' , see text ) and with an aluminum sample ( dashed line ) .",

    "[ nifig ] , a pronounced negative joule magnetostriction ( directly related to the field - dependent magnetization ) and a slightly positive forced magnetostriction ( the magnetostriction in fields beyond that required to saturate the magnetization ) are observed .",
    "both of these features are consistent with published results @xcite .",

    "the dilatometer , as described , can accommodate sample thicknesses up to about 5 mm , though we know of no reason why the design could not be increased in size to handle larger samples or reduced in size for operation in more confined environments .",

    "the open architecture , sample mounting scheme , and straightforward relationship between sample dilation and the capacitance of the dilatometer , make this a relatively simple dilatometer to construct and operate .",
