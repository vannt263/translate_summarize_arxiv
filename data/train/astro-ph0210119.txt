    "mayall ( 1935 ) first recognized ic10 as an extragalactic object , and , in _ the realm of the nebula , _ hubble ( 1936 ) proposed that it was likely a member of the local group .",
    "its location just 3 degrees out of the galactic plane has hampered investigations , but hubble s description of it as  one of the most curious objects in the sky \" has proven prophetic .",
    "today ic10 is understood to be an irregular galaxy undergoing an intense burst of star formation likely triggered by infalling gas from an extended cloud which is counter - rotating with respect to the galaxy proper , as discussed by wilcots & miller ( 1998 ) , who conclude that ic10 is a galaxy that is still forming .",
    "the starburst nature of ic10 was revealed primarily from the high number of wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) found by massey , conti & armandroff ( 1992 ) and massey & armandroff ( 1995 ) .",
    "hodge & lee ( 1990 ) had motivated these studies by their discovery of 144 h  ii regions , the brightest of which were known to be comparable to the brightest seen in the smc ( hunter & gallagher 1985 ; kennicutt 1988 ) , a galaxy known to contain a substantial massive star population .",
    "massey et al .",
    "( 1992 ) used interference imaging to identify 22 wr candidates , of which 15 were confirmed spectroscopically ( massey & armandroff 1995 ) .",
    "this number was quite unexpectly high .",
    "ic 10 is about half the size of the smc ( van den bergh 2000 ) , which contains 11 wrs ( massey & duffy 2001 ) ; thus the overall surface density of wrs in ic10 is at least 5 times greater than in the smc .",
    "the galaxy - wide surface density of wrs in ic10 is in fact comparable to that of the most active ob associations in m  33 ( massey & armandroff 1995 ) .",
    "the distribution of wrs across ic10 shows that this high star - formation activity is not confined to a few regions ( which would simply be the result of statistical fluctuations or  graininess \" in the star formation rate ) , but rather is characteristic of a the galaxy as a whole .",
    "this is the classic definition of a starburst galaxy ( hunter 1986 ; searle & sargent 1972 ) .",
    "however , one of the very peculiar results of these wr studies was the abnormally large ratio of wc to wn stars given ic10 s metallicity ( log o / h+12=8.25 , skillman , kennicutt & hodge 1989 ; garnett 1990 ) . figure  [ fig : wcwn ] shows the relative number of wc and wn stars plotted for different galaxies of the local group .",
    "the interpretation of the strong trend with metallicity is straightforward : since the stellar winds of massive stars are driven by radiation pressure in highly ionized metal lines , stars of a given luminosity ( and mass ) will have a lower mass - loss rate in a lower metallicity system , and hence will lose less mass during their lifetime . in the  conti scenario \" ( conti 1976 , maeder & conti 1994 ) a massive star peels down like an onion due to mass - loss , revealing first the equilibrium products of the cno cycle at its surface ( wn stars ) , and then the he - burning products ( wc stars ) . very massive stars will therefore evolve first to the wn stage and subsequently to the wc stage , while a less massive star might evolve only through wn . at low metallicities",
    "the wcs should come only from the very highest mass stars ( massey 2003 ) .    the peculiar wc / wn ratio may be telling us something important about the star formation process in this , the nearest starburst galaxy .",
    "if the imf was top - heavy ( or inverted ) , with an overabundance of the very highest mass stars , this could explain the results .",
    "however , hunter ( 2001 ) finds a normal imf slope for the intermediate mass stars in ic10 .",
    "it would be very odd for the imf of the highest mass stars to be decoupled from that of the intermediate - mass stars .",
    "alternatively , if the burst that produced the wolf - rayet progenitors had been extremely coeval , then an abnormal wc / wn population could certainly result ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) .",
    "however , that would require a burst of duration less than 200,000 years over a scale of a kpc .",
    "instead , a third , more prosaic possibility , is that the wc / wn ratio is strongly affected by incompleteness .",
    "wn stars are much harder to detect than wc stars as their strongest emission lines are considerably weaker ( see massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "massey & armandroff ( 1995 ) argued against this possibility on the basis that they had detected one wn star with lines as weak as commonly associated with wns .",
    "however , since that time royer et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter rsmv ) have reported the discovery of 13 new wr candidates in ic10 .",
    "( one of these , their number 9 , is actually identical to star 6 in massey et al .",
    "taken at face value , the additional stars would actually increase the wc / wn ratio rather than decrease it .",
    "spectroscopy of this sample by crowther et al .",
    "( 2002a ) confirmed 9 , leaving the wc / wn ratio little changed .",
    "nevertheless , the study certainly calls into question the completeness of the original massey et al .",
    "( 1992 ) sample .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to report on the first results of a new , much deeper search for wolf - rayet stars in ic10 , along with spectroscopic confirmation of two of these stars .",
    "complete details will be reported when the spectroscopic followup is complete .",
    "however , the number of good wr candidates found is striking , and probably resolves the issue of the peculiar wc / wn ratio .",
    "ic10 was imaged through three interference filters with the 4-m mayall telescope and mosaic ccd camera ( 8k x 8k ) .",
    "the data were obtained on ut 19 and 20 sept 2001 .",
    "the filter system is based upon that described by armandroff & massey ( 1985 ) and massey & johnson ( 1998 ) , but in large , 5.75  in by 5.75  in ( 146  mm @xmath3 146  mm ) format .",
    "_ filter is centered at c  iii @xmath4 , the strongest optical line in wc stars .",
    "_ filter is centered on he  ii @xmath5 , the strongest emission line in wn stars ( although it is also present in wcs ; see smith 1968 ) . the continuum filter _ ct _ is centered at @xmath6 .",
    "the central wavelengths were designed for use in the fast , f/3 beam of the 4-m prime focus camera , and are roughly 50  in width .",
    "the exposure time was 1.5 hrs in each filter , with the exposures broken into three 1800 sec exposures with the telescope dithered by 150 arcsecs ns and ew between exposures . the scale is 0.27 arcsec pixel@xmath7 , and the seeing on the nine images ranged from 0.85 to 0.97 arcsec , with an average of 0.92 arcsec .",
    "the transparency was excellent .",
    "( for comparison , the massey et al",
    ".  1992 survey for wrs in ic10 used 1 hr exposures through each filter under 2.0 - 2.6 arcsec seeing with drifting clouds interrupting the exposures . )",
    "exposures of spectrophotometric standards through the _ ct _ filter were used to determine the continuum magnitudes m@xmath8 , and are accurate to 0.1  mag .",
    "the mosaic camera consists of 8 separate chips , each covering 18.4 arcmin ( ew ) by 9.2 arcmin ( ns ) , each large compared to the optical extent of ic10 ( half - light radius 2 arcmins ) .",
    "ic10 had been centered on one of the chips , and it and a neighboring chip were reduced in the identical manner .",
    "the latter was intended to serve as a control .",
    "the data were processed through the iraf mosaic pipeline with refinements from the instrumental magnitudes were obtained using the point - spread - function fitting routine  daophot \" , as implemented under iraf . all together",
    ", 114,000 stellar images were photometered . on average , 5300 stars",
    "were measured on each frame of the control chip , and 7400 stars were measured on each frame of the galaxy chip .",
    "candidate wrs were selected by comparing the magnitude differences _ wc - ct _ and _ wn - ct _ to the uncertainty in the magnitudes based upon photon statistics and read - noise , after a zero - point magnitude adjustment was made based upon the full ensemble of stars .",
    "stars with magnitude differences more negative than @xmath9  mag and whose significance level was @xmath10 were considered valid candidates .",
    "the 9 frames were treated as 3 independent sets , grouped by the three dithered telescope positions .",
    "each candidate was examined on an image display by eye and checked for problems .",
    "altogether the search revealed 238 unique candidates on the galaxy field , and 135 unique candidates for the control field ; many of the candidates were found multiple times .",
    "we expect that none of the  wr candidates \" in the control field are real , given their location @xmath11 arcmin from ic10 .",
    "such spurious detections are expected given the small magnitude differences we are looking for , and the possible presence of absorption features in the _ ct _ filter with non - wrs .",
    "it is for this reason that we used a control field .",
    "the search found _ all _ 24 of the spectroscopically confirmed wrs massey & armandroff 1995 ; crowther et al .",
    "2002a ) with significance levels ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 . the weakest - lined star had a magnitude difference of @xmath14  mag , and the strongest - lined star @xmath15  mag between the wr filter ( _ wc _ or _ wn _ ) and the continuum filter _",
    "ct_. p. crowther ( private communication ) kindly conveyed the specifics of which rsmv stars he had been able to confirm spectroscopically , and their spectral types in advance of publication .",
    "we therefore note that our survey successfully distinguishes all of the known wcs from the known wns if we adopt a dividing line of _ wc - wn_=@xmath16 .",
    "late - type wns will have strong n  iii 4634,42 in the _ wc _ filter , while early - type wcs will have very broad c  iii @xmath4 spilling over into the _",
    "wn _ filter , so stars with a small absolute magnitude difference _",
    "wc - wn _ are hard to classify just based upon our filter photometry .",
    "the royer , vreux , & manfroid ( 1998 ) wr filter system uses five filters to help classify wr candidates to excitation subtype ( wn2 , wn3 ... wn9 ; wc4 , wc5 ... wc9 ) .",
    "thus on the basis of their photometry alone , royer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) announced the detection of very late - type wc ( wc9 ) stars in ic10 .",
    "this result was highly surprising , as wc9 stars have previously been found only in much higher metallicity environments , for reasons thought to be well understood from stellar evolution : late - type wcs are thought to result from more enriched surface material , and the star can only peel down far enough to reveal these layers if the metallicity is high and mass - loss rates during the o - type stages are therefore high ( smith & maeder 1991 ) .",
    "crowther et al .",
    "( 2002b ) has recently called that into question , suggesting instead that the late - type wcs are the result of stronger stellar winds in the wr phase itself , but in either event wc9s are not expected in low metallicity environments .",
    "this too was felt to be part of the puzzle of star formation in ic10 ( royer et al .",
    "however , our survey detected _ none _ of these wc9 candidates .",
    "an attempt to perform a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of these stars by crowther et al .",
    "( 2002a ) using gemini failed to detect any emission .",
    "we can probably conclude that these stars are not real wrs .",
    "although the detection of all the known ic10 wrs , and the lack of detection of the spectroscopically rejected wr candidates gives us strong confidence in our survey , there is no substitute for spectroscopic confirmation . during a period of poor seeing at the mmt 6.5-m ( 14 sept 2002 ) we took time from our main program and observed two of our new candidates using a single slit setting . we used the 800 line / mm grating on the blue channel with a 2  arcsec slit to obtain 3.8  resolution spectra in the blue",
    "; the exposure time was 2700 secs .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] : both are wolf - rayet stars of wn type .",
    "the coordinates are given in table  1 , along with the equivalent width ( ew ) and full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the he  ii @xmath5 line .",
    "the lines are sufficiently broad to rule out the possibility that either star is an of star , which might also show he  ii and/or n  iii emission .",
    "ic10-wr24 is by far the brightest wr found in ic10 , and is likely a blend of a wr star and another star .",
    "a blend would also explain the very weak emission ( table  1 ) combined with a normal line width .    in figure",
    "[ fig : compare ] we show a comparison of the photometry of wr candidates in the galaxy field with that from the control field . we expect that none of the 135 candidates in the latter are real .",
    "given that both the galaxy field ( 238 candidates ) and control field covered an equal area , we calculate that ic10 may contain @xmath17 wolf - rayet stars in total .",
    "although this number seems fantastically large , we note that 26 have now been confirmed spectroscopically : 15 by massey & armandroff ( 1995 ) , 9 by crowther et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , and 2 here .",
    "what then can we conclude about the statistics of wcs and wns in ic10 ?",
    "first , for the spectroscopically confirmed wrs the wc / wn ratio is now 1.2 rather than 2.0 . if we simply take all of the wr candidates in the ic10 field , and correct by the number of  wc \" and  wn \" detections in the control field",
    ", we would expect to find a ratio of 0.3 .",
    "this ratio is only slightly higher than that of the outer region of m  33 , of similar metallicity ( figure  [ fig : wcwn2 ] ) .",
    "it is true that this result is somewhat dependent upon our choice of the dividing line between  wc \" and  wn \" in our photometry .",
    "while our choice is consistent with our knowledge of the ic10 wr spectral types , spectroscopy of the remaining candidates will be needed to confirm this result .",
    "if our statistical correction of the number of new candidates is correct , then spectroscopy should be able to confirm an aditional @xmath1 wcs and @xmath18 wns in ic10 .",
    "even so , this may not represent the complete number , given the high reddening .",
    "thus the mystery of the high wc / wn ratio in ic10 may be solved .",
    "however , spectroscopic confirmation of such large additional number of wrs in ic10 would certainly make this galaxy even more unique in terms of its massive star population .",
    "two pieces of evidence suggest that this may well be the case .",
    "first , of the spectroscopically confirmed wns , two are of wn7 - 8 type . at low metallicities",
    "the only similar late - type wns are found in the 30  dor region of the lmc , where very high mass stars abound .",
    "studies of coeval regions containing these stars in the milky way suggest that they come from only the highest mass stars ( massey , degioia - eastwood , & waterhouse 2001 ) , and we would expect the progenitors to be even more massive in a low metallicity environment ( massey 2003 ) .",
    "this is consistent then with ic10 having a normal imf but an exceptionally large population of massive stars .",
    "secondly , the integrated h@xmath0 emission suggests that ic10 has one of the two highest rates of star formation per unit area known of a representative sample of non - interacting irregular galaxies ( hunter 1997 and private communication ) .",
    "the  active \" area of ic10 is approximately 8 arcmin @xmath3 8 arcmin in angular extent ; at a distance of 660 kpc ( sakai , madore , & freedman 1999 ) , this correspond to an area of 2.2 kpc@xmath19 .",
    "thus if our estimate is correct , ic10 would contain roughly 45 wolf - rayet stars kpc@xmath20 . for comparison",
    ", the lmc contains @xmath1 wrs kpc@xmath20 ( massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "a typical galactic ob association might contain several wrs , and be 100  pc in diameter , i.e. , with a surface density of a couple of hundred wrs kpc@xmath20 only several times larger than what we see _ globally _ in ic10 .",
    "thus , if confirmed , the high number of wr stars would suggest that ic10 has a population of massive stars similar to that of an ob association but on a kpc scale .",
