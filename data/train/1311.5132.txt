    "with the increasingly accurate measurements of the coupling properties of the higgs boson at the lhc , the whole phenomenology of electroweak physics is entering a new era .",
    "it is widely thought that , although the higgs itself is no evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) , there are still various points upon which new physics would be required , as for instance in providing a dark matter candidate or by solving the naturalness issue . within bsm theories ,",
    "the coupling properties of the higgs are generically not fixed , making the accurate measurements of those an important constraint to take into account .",
    "this constraint is particularly crucial in extensions of the standard model ( sm ) where new scalars are added . in this case",
    ", one expects the properties of the various scalars to be related , thus allowing a correlation between the determination of the couplings of the sm - like higgs observed at the lhc and future prospects to discover other scalars .",
    "enlarging the scalar sector of the sm is a common practice in many theories ( as , e.g. , in supersymmetry or 2 higgs doublet models ) , it is thus no surprise that studies , either on the phenomenology or the experimental side , have already explored this possibility .",
    "for instance , lep searches for a light sm higgs provide us constraints on theories with an additional light scalar , while the lhc provides at present analyses for heavy higgses . however interpreting those limits in a common framework with the measurements of the sm - like higgs couplings",
    "has not yet become a standard , therefore the potential power of such studies can be improved if this possibility is considered .",
    "the aim of the article is the following : we will introduce a parametrisation of a two scalars model , one of them corresponding to the observed higgs state and one to a new scalar , and advocate for its use to facilitate the interface between theories and experimental results .",
    "we shall show in some specific theories how much the information we have on the sm - like higgs affects the predicted behaviour of the other scalar .",
    "we consider the case of an additional scalar lighter than the sm - like higgs : this choice is motivated by the fact that such searches are currently not handled by the lhc analyses , making it an interesting playground for testing possible scalars that would have escaped the lep searches . in the rest of the paper we will refer to the scalar state corresponding to the observed resonance as `` the sm - like higgs '' , and the other one as `` the light scalar '' .",
    "the article is organised as follows : section [ sec : param ] defines our parametrisation , section [ sec : models ] describes the two specific models that we have chosen to exemplify the parametrisation , section [ sec : constraints ] deals with the various constraints that we have imposed on such models and section [ sec : results ] comments the different features of a possible light scalar search at lhc in both models .",
    "the basic way to test a model is to compare the predicted rate of a process to an observed rate .",
    "however , matching the two is often difficult due to experiment - specific cuts and statistical combinations . by employing a generic parametrisation",
    ", this work needs to be done only once and the results are then available for any bsm model belonging to the class described by the parametrisation : in our case models with the presence of an extra light scalar and all other bsm states decoupled , at least within a certain approximation .",
    "as we are interested in a lighter additional scalar and the higgs boson is the only scalar particle in the sm , we will compare the effects of this new particle to those of a sm higgs boson of the same mass .",
    "therefore the parameters we use for both scalars are defined in a similar way : we normalise the couplings of each one to those of a sm higgs with the same mass .",
    "this choice is not specially motivated by theoretical considerations , but is a simple way of choosing a common normalisation , which does not affect the generality of the approach .",
    "our main assumptions are that both scalars are @xmath0-even , custodial symmetric , according to which the couplings of the w and z bosons to the two scalars scale with a common factor and that their couplings are universal in flavour : all up - type or down - type quarks or leptons coupling factors . finally ,",
    "for particles that do not couple at tree - level to the higgs , such as photons and gluons , we use a loop - inspired parametrisation .      the first kind of particles related to the higgs physics are obviously those which interact at tree - level with the higgs boson in the sm , i.e. quarks , leptons and weak bosons .",
    "these interactions appear in the lagrangian from the covariant derivative in the case of w and z and from the yukawa terms for fermions . in bsm models",
    "these interactions may differ from those of a sm higgs boson although since we consider here only models with the same lorentz structure as in the standard model , we can parametrise the difference by a ratio of couplings . as the interactions of both scalars will be altered , we define two sets of parameters as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 labels the two higgs bosons @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the 126 gev higgs ) , and custodial symmetry implies that the couplings to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons are multiplied by the same modifiers @xmath7 . following our assumption of universality ,",
    "the couplings of the lighter generations are scaled by the same modifiers as top , bottom and tau .      among the main decay modes of the higgs boson , two stand apart since they do not occur at tree - level : photons and gluons . as advocated in @xcite",
    ", we do not define the parameters measuring the effect of new physics by the ratios of the partial widths ( as done in @xcite ) but rather by the ratios of the loop amplitudes . in this way",
    ", we can define parameters that only include the loop effects of new physics states , thus explicitly disentangling loop effects from the modification of tree level couplings .",
    "for instance , the coupling to photons is affected by the @xmath8 parameter , defined as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the amplitude of the loop of the particle x calculated with sm couplings for a higgs boson of the mass of the scalar @xmath11 .",
    "we took the top amplitude @xmath12 as a reference amplitude for new physics since it allows for an easy interpretation in terms of top partners , but it should be mentioned that this choice is purely arbitrary . although the ratio of partial widths may seem more convenient on the experimental side , we choose this parametrisation to keep the loop structure visible and avoid correlations between @xmath13 and tree - level parameters ( @xmath14 ) that would appear otherwise .",
    "we define similarly @xmath15 for the coupling to gluons . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in order to show how our parametrisation applies to different models , we will probe two theories that have been the subject of many analyses dedicated to the higgs phenomenology : the 2hdm ( 2 higgs doublet model ) which is an example of a typical description of an extended higgs sector , and the nmssm ( next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ) which is a typical example of an ultra - violet completion of the low energy effective scalar sector . due to their rich phenomenologies ,",
    "a complete analysis is beyond the scope of this work : we only take them to illustrate how one can compare directly two widely different models through the parametrisation we suggest .",
    "we emphasise that the aim of our study is not to make statements on the phenomenology of 2hdm and nmssm in general , but rather to show how the parametrisation can help in disentangling different specific models .",
    "note that for both models we will impose @xmath16 gev in order to avoid the decay @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , this mass range probably is the easiest region to search for a light scalar at the lhc , as signals at lower mass would be marred by very large backgrounds and would be severely affected by the triggers .      a simple extension of the scalar sector of the sm is to add another doublet : this gives rise to the well known 2hdm , which has been thoroughly studied with respect to the lhc ( with a lighter scalar in @xcite , and a heavier one in @xcite ) . in the following",
    ", we will only highlight the details relevant to our study since the detailed equations can be found elsewhere ( see @xcite , among others ) .",
    "in particular the addition of a second doublet changes the physics of the whole scalar sector , particularly the potential which now takes the following form : @xmath18 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda_1 \\left(\\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_1\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda_2 \\left(\\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_2\\right)^2 +   \\lambda_3 \\left(\\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_1\\right)\\left(\\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_2\\right)+ \\lambda_4 \\left(\\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_2\\right ) \\left(\\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_1\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left\\{\\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda_5 \\left(\\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_2\\right)^2 +   \\left[\\lambda_6 \\left ( \\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_1 \\right ) + \\lambda_7 \\left ( \\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_2 \\right ) \\right ] \\left(\\phi_1^{\\dagger }   \\phi_2\\right ) + h.c . \\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the potential is real , @xmath19 need to be real , while @xmath20 may be complex . as we limited ourselves to a @xmath0-conserving higgs sector",
    ", we will here consider all parameters to be real .",
    "furthermore , by imposing a @xmath21 symmetry , we can set @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "since the model now has two scalar doublets @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the ewsb is not necessarily achieved by having only one of the two doublets acquiring a @xmath26 , but a combination of the two .",
    "we can identify this combination by rotating to a basis in which only one of the doublets acquires a @xmath26 .",
    "this rotation is parametrised by an angle known as @xmath27 .",
    "after symmetry breaking , instead of the one higgs boson in the standard model , we get five scalars from the remaining degrees of freedom of the doublets : two @xmath0-even neutral states @xmath3 , one @xmath0-odd neutral state @xmath28 and two charged ones @xmath29 , charge conjugates . as for the quadratic part of the lagrangian , the @xmath0-odd and charged",
    "higgses are necessarily mass eigenstates , but there is still possible mixing for the two @xmath0-even scalars . as we rotate the basis once again from the @xmath26-acquiring - basis to the mass basis , we introduce another rotation angle , @xmath30 .",
    "this angle is related to the commonly defined angle @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "all parameters from the potential can then be translated into the parameters in that last basis : @xmath33 in the following we will probe the parameter space of the model by a numerical scan over the parameters . we shall probe the following ranges :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also learn from figure [ fig : kappas ] that the correlations between @xmath34 and @xmath35 differ significantly between the two models : in the nmssm they have the same behaviour ( which explains thus why @xmath36 behaves the same way as @xmath37 ) while in the 2hdm , @xmath35 can reach high values even for @xmath38 . + a crucial point in disentangling the phenomenology of different models is through the coupling to @xmath39 quarks , which is parametrised by @xmath40 : we show the @xmath41 plane in the bottom row of figure [ fig : kappas ] .",
    "one notices that in the 2hdm - ii case , there is no possibility for @xmath40 to vanish if @xmath34 does not , situation that differs significantly from 2hdm - i or the nmssm . such a feature would not come unnoticed at the lhc : indeed , since the width of a sm light higgs is dominated by the @xmath42 decay , having @xmath43 will enhance all other decay modes , in particular the @xmath44 one .",
    "in fact all points with a signal strength in the @xmath45 channel higher than 1 in figure [ fig : mugam ] benefits from this mechanism .",
    "the largest enhancements also benefit from a non - vanishing @xmath46 parameter : in particular some of the nmssm points are noticeably enhanced by the chargino contribution . thus in this case",
    "the significant difference of signal strengths from various theories can be explained in a universal way through the correlations of the @xmath47 parameters , without recourse to the underlying uv completion .",
    "another feature of 2hdm - ii shows up in the @xmath41 and @xmath48 planes of figure [ fig : kappas ] : we see that the points allowed by lhc constraints for which @xmath34 does not vanish form lines which are either @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "this can be understood from eq.[eq : kvkf ] : approximating @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( which is the limit of @xmath4 being completely sm - like with respect to fermions ) , one obtain the two solutions @xmath53 or @xmath54 , depending on the sign of @xmath55 . for the time being , lhc constraints on @xmath56 or @xmath57 are not strong enough to justify the approximation @xmath52 , which is why there is no such lines in type i. however in type ii , the yukawa structure is such that , for @xmath58 , small variations of @xmath57 will correspond to large variations of @xmath56 .",
    "the later being not too loosely constrained does not come from the @xmath59 analysis , but rather from the total width of the higgs , which affect all signal strengths . ] , the former will stay in a narrow band . this narrow band will thus translate to a line @xmath49 , as foreseen by our earlier argument . note that type iii exhibits a very similar behaviour as of type ii , while type iv is in - between type i and type ii : in this case @xmath57 and @xmath56 vary the same way , but now @xmath60 exhibits large variations , and will thus constrain them . the lhc constraint on @xmath60",
    "being looser than @xmath56 , the allowed bands will be broader .",
    "the possibility of an extra scalar , lighter than the 126 gev state already observed , is still compatible with current experimental data in different models of new physics , and our study suggests that dedicated analysis of this mass range at the lhc are an interesting possibility for the experimental collaborations . if such an experimental search is carried out , it would be a crucial point to use a common parametrisation for the coupling of both scalars and to keep this parametrisation as general as possible .",
    "we have shown that the one we are suggesting ( a straightforward extension of what is currently done for the 126 gev state alone ) could fulfil this goal , and comes with the advantage of being easily related to purely experimental quantities ( such as cross - sections ) and at the same time allowing a clear disentangling of some specific models in terms of correlations of the different @xmath47 parameters .",
    "in addition to that , some effects at the experimental level , such as an enhancement in the channel @xmath45 , could be explained directly in terms of the allowed values for @xmath47 , without considering the underlying model : such a feature would greatly simplify the study of the phenomenology of an additional light scalar .",
