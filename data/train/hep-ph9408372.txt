    "charm production at large @xmath0 is a very fascinating regime which provides a lot of information about the internal structure , especially the higher fock state components of the projectile in the question @xcite .",
    "no matter whether it is deep inelastic scattering , pion nucleus collisions , open charm or hidden charm production @xcite , all of them show anomalous behavior which can not be explained by leading twist pqcd .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath1 limit , there is a new hard scale @xmath2 , and the corrections to leading twist terms are of order @xmath3 .",
    "actually , in the combined limit , @xmath4 the twist expansion breaks down and higher twist terms are no longer suppressed and can become dominant .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in section 2 , we will review some of the experimental data which shows that higher twist effects are important at large @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that higher twist terms are suppressed by @xmath5 so it raises the question why they become dominant at large @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we need to understand the physical origin of the suppression of higher twist terms at moderate @xmath0 and this is reviewed in section 3 .",
    "we then explain in section 4 why in the new limit , @xmath6 and @xmath7 but with @xmath8 fixed , higher twist terms are not suppressed .",
    "we will argue in section 5 that in this new qcd limit , the cross section for freeing the @xmath9 pair is not small due to the fact that the dominant contribution comes from peripheral processes in which slow spectator quarks interact with the target .",
    "these new production mechanisms are then applied to different processes and can explain at least some of anomalous behavior observed .",
    "finally , we give our conclusion in the last section .",
    "* ( a ) * it is reported by emc @xcite that the @xmath11 distribution measured at large @xmath12 is anomalously high .",
    "the cern measurements disagree with photon - gluon fusion by a factor of 20 to 30 at @xmath13 gev@xmath14 and @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "1a and b. one should notice that the measured @xmath12 is the fractional longitudinal momentum for one charm quark only .",
    "the total @xmath12 for the @xmath9 pair should be nearly double which is @xmath16 , very close to @xmath17 . in fig . 1a and b , one can see that photon - gluon fusion fits the data well for @xmath18 less than @xmath19 , but badly for @xmath12 larger than @xmath20 .",
    "* ( b ) * a sudden change in polarization of the @xmath21 is reported by cip @xcite and e537 @xcite at large @xmath10 in @xmath22 collisions .",
    "the polarization of the @xmath23 is determined by the angular distribution of its decay muons in the @xmath23 rest frame . by rotational symmetry and parity ,",
    "the angular distribution of massless muons , integrated over the azimuthal angle , has the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the @xmath26 and the projectile direction ( _ i.e. _ , in the gottfried  jackson frame ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is directly related to the polarization of the @xmath23 particle , _ i.e. _ , @xmath28 in fig .",
    "2 , where @xmath27 is plotted against @xmath29 one can clearly see that the polarization of the produced @xmath23 changes sharply from unpolarized to longitudinally polarized around @xmath30 . this dramatic effect is inconsistent with leading order qcd .    * ( c ) * the measurement from na3 @xcite shows that double @xmath21 pairs are hadroproduced only at large @xmath31 in the na3 experiment , 6 @xmath32 are found at 150 gev and 7@xmath32 at 280 gev in @xmath33 beam scattering with a platinum target . in table 1 , we list the @xmath0 of the @xmath32 pair of all 13 events in ascending order .",
    "the mean @xmath0 of the pair is @xmath34 ( 150 gev ) and @xmath35 ( 280 gev ) which is very large .",
    "@xmath0 of the @xmath32 pair of all 13 events in ascending order .",
    "the data are from ref",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * ( d ) * dramatic leading particle effects in hadronic @xmath36 production are observed by wa82 @xcite and e769 @xcite experiments . in @xmath37 interactions with hadrons or nuclei ,",
    "the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are referred to as  leading \" charm mesons while the @xmath40 and @xmath41 are  nonleading \" .",
    "the asymmetry between leading and nonleading charm , which has been used in the analyses of the wa82 and e769 collaborations , is defined as @xmath42 both experiment find that the measured @xmath43 increases from @xmath44 for @xmath45 to @xmath46 around @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . therefore , the leading charm asymmetry is localized at large @xmath0 only .    according to leading twist qcd ,",
    "the hadroproduction cross section of @xmath36 mesons is given by @xmath48 the structure functions of the initial hadrons , @xmath49 , are process independent while the fragmentation functions @xmath50 are independent of the quantum numbers of both the projectile and the target .",
    "thus , leading twist qcd predicts the leading charm asymmetry to be nearly zero . and @xmath51 production due to @xmath52 and @xmath53 interference @xcite . ]",
    "the observed large leading charm asymmetry breaks qcd factorization which strongly suggests that it is a higher twist effect .    * ( e ) * the data @xcite on @xmath23 production in hadron - nucleus collisions exhibits a surprising result .",
    "the na3 and e772 data give direct evident for the breakdown of the leading twist approximation at large @xmath0 . following the argument of ref.@xcite , by the factorization theorem , the cross section of @xmath23 production in @xmath54 collisions is ,    @xmath55    for simplicity we just assume gluon gluon fusion to be dominant . for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , approximately @xmath58 , @xmath59 . in the factorized formula ( [ factor ] )",
    ", the nuclear @xmath60-dependence appears only through the target function @xmath61 .",
    "hence , ratios @xmath62 of @xmath23 production should be independent of c.m .",
    "energies @xmath63 when @xmath63 and @xmath10 varied in such a way as to keep @xmath64 constant . however , as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the na3 data @xcite shows that the ratio for h / pt is consistent with _",
    "feynman scaling _ , _ i.e. _ , scales with @xmath10 but not with @xmath64 .",
    "a clear energy dependence is seen at small values of @xmath64 .",
    "thus the leading twist factorization fails at large feynman @xmath65 of the @xmath23 , since @xmath59 .",
    "a similar result was observed by combining @xmath66 data from na3 and e772 @xcite .",
    "the same anomalous behavior is also observed if one studies the nuclear @xmath60-dependence of the @xmath23 production cross section through the parametrization @xmath67 .",
    "the effective power @xmath68 at different energies show that indeed @xmath69 , _ i.e. _ , the nuclear suppression obeys feynman scaling @xcite , and is not a function of @xmath64 .",
    "the power @xmath68 decreases from 0.97 at @xmath70 to 0.7 as @xmath6 @xcite ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , _ i.e. _ , becomes surface dominated at large @xmath10 .",
    "the above nuclear @xmath60-dependence and the leading charm asymmetry directly contradict leading - twist pqcd factorization and suggest that higher twist effects play an important role at large @xmath10 .",
    "but it is a well known fact that higher twist effects are suppressed by @xmath5 .",
    "this raises the question of how the higher twist effects survive and become dominant at large @xmath10 . in the next section",
    "we will review the physics of higher twist terms and point out a way to overcome the usual suppression .",
    "let us take the well known process , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , to illustrate the physics of ` leading twist ' and ` higher twist ' terms . in leading twist diagrams ( fig .",
    "6a ) , only the active ( hit ) parton interacts with the external photon and there is no connection between the spectator partons and the active parton . on the other hand",
    ", there are strong interactions between the active parton and the spectator partons in higher twist diagrams ( fig .",
    "if we take the ` infinitive momentum frame ' in which the parton language is valid , the proton is boosted to very high momentum along the @xmath71 axis with four momentum given by @xmath72 . in this frame",
    ", the photon momentum can be taken as @xmath73 and the virtuality of the photon is @xmath74 ; _ i.e. _ , the resolving power in transverse dimension .",
    "in other words , the transverse dimension of the partons that interact , directly or indirectly , with the photon is of the order of @xmath75 . with the above pictures in mind",
    ", it is easy to understand why the higher twist terms are suppressed by @xmath76 in the usual bjorken limit @xmath77 with @xmath65 fixed . as the interaction time @xmath78 of the hard subprocess @xmath79 scattering is very short , only of the order of @xmath75 , any interaction between the active parton and the spectator partons must occurs within this short time interval @xmath78 and so they must be within transverse distance of @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "this immediately leads to the conclusion that higher twist terms are suppressed by @xmath81 as the probability of finding two partons with dimension @xmath76 within an area of @xmath76 is given by the geometrical factor @xmath82 , with @xmath83 the size of proton .",
    "however , there is an exception to the above conclusion .",
    "suppression of higher twist terms depends a lot on the size of proton , which is of order of @xmath17 fm , much larger than the size of the parton , which is @xmath75 .",
    "if somehow the initial proton or meson is already very small , of the same size as the parton , then there is no suppression . but how can that be realized ?",
    "the answer to that question lies on the large @xmath65 kinematic region and we will review that region in the next section .",
    "in the large @xmath65 kinematic region , besides the usual hard scale @xmath86 , another new scale @xmath87 , which reflects the hardness of this new limit , emerges @xcite .",
    "in fact , this new hard scale actually is the transverse size of the meson ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath88 . if the two scales are comparable ; _",
    "i.e. _ , taking the combined limit as in equation ( [ combined ] ) , higher twist contributions will not be suppressed assuming @xmath89 . in this new limit ,",
    "higher and leading twist are of the same order , @xmath90    but how does the new hard scale @xmath87 emerge in the limit @xmath1 ?",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "8 which gives the probability amplitude for the @xmath1 perturbative distribution of the meson .",
    "the soft non - perturbative distribution is described by the wavefunction @xmath91 which is suppressed in the extreme kinematic limit @xmath92 or @xmath93 .",
    "the perturbative contribution comes from diagrams where one or more gluons are exchanged between the two quarks . for simplicity , we just consider exchanging one gluon between the quarks in fig .",
    "the separation between the two quarks @xmath94 can be estimated by considering the intermediate state @xmath95 .",
    "the virtuality of this state is given by @xmath96 when @xmath97 since @xmath98 is independent of @xmath99 , the perturbative tail is @xmath100 which shows that the transverse distance between the two quarks is @xmath101 , very compact at the moment of creation . for a typical value , @xmath102 , we find the new hard scale @xmath87 as promised .",
    "another interesting physical quantity is the transverse distance @xmath103 between the two quarks after the exchange of the gluon , _",
    "i.e. _ , when one of the quark carries nearly all the longitudinal momentum .",
    "the life time of this intermediate state is very brief , @xmath104 nevertheless , during this short life time , the ` slow ' quark can move a transverse distance @xmath105 which for @xmath106 can be of the order of 1 fm . hence , the specific large @xmath65 kinematic region selects a very compact fock state component of the meson at the moment of creation and then it expands very quickly to its normal size of 1 fm .",
    "the large transverse size @xmath103 of the light quarks has a very important implication in the production of heavy quarks .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that there is a new scale @xmath2 at large @xmath65 and that the transverse size of the light quarks @xmath103 can be as large as 1 fm . in this section , we want to exploit these properties in the production of heavy quarks at large @xmath65 .",
    "as the transverse size @xmath103 of the light quarks is very large , one can imagine that the heavy quark pair can be freed easily by deflecting the slow light quark .",
    "this phenomenon has been studied in ref.@xcite in the case of heavy quark production on nuclear target .",
    "the new limit in this case is defined by :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the mass of the heavy quark pair . to understand the physics in this new limit ,",
    "let us consider the  extrinsic \" and  intrinsic \" diagrams as shown in figs 9a and 9b .",
    "in the extrinsic diagram the produced heavy quark pair couples directly to only one parton in the projectile while in the intrinsic case it couples to several .",
    "the energy difference in the extrinsic diagram is given by    @xmath109    the first term @xmath110 comes from the effectively stopped light valence quarks @xmath111 as the produced @xmath112 pair carries almost all of the momentum ( @xmath1 ) while the second term comes from the virtuality of the gluon which is of the order of the mass of the heavy quark pair .",
    "in order to get a large production cross section , the energy difference should be minimized and thus the two terms in equation ( [ energydifference ] ) are of the same order , _",
    "i.e. _ ,    @xmath113    now we have a very nice result .",
    "the transverse momentum square of the light quarks are of the order of @xmath114 and so these states can be resolved by a target gluon of transverse momentum @xmath115 of order of @xmath116 .",
    "hence the hardness of the scattering from the target is not @xmath117 as one would expect in the leading twist calculation , but instead it is @xmath118 .",
    "actually , the transverse size of the stopped light quark pair is given by @xmath119 .",
    "this explains why the scattering dominantly occurs off the light quarks .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that heavy quarks can be , and are , produced at large @xmath65 by soft peripheral scattering and so the cross section is large .",
    "these new production mechanisms can help to explain the various anomalous behaviors of charm production as described in section 2 .    in leading twist diagrams , the usual lowest order diagram describing the fusion process @xmath120",
    "is shown in fig . 10 .",
    "although the size of the light quark pair is large , the heavy quark pair @xmath112 still has a small transverse size @xmath121 .",
    "a target gluon can resolve the @xmath112 pair only provided that it has a commensurate wavelength , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath122 as indicated in fig .  11 .",
    "this is much large than the @xmath123 required to resolve the light quarks .",
    "hence the leading twist is actually suppressed by @xmath124 compared to the new mechanisms in the new limit .",
    "one can also go through the same argument as described in the previous section and conclude that the fock state of the projectile hadron from which the heavy pair is produced has a small transverse size @xmath125 . because of the smallness of the transverse size , the intrinsic diagram as shown in fig .",
    "9b , where an extra gluon is attached to the heavy quark pair , is not suppressed relative to the extrinsic diagram fig .",
    "therefore , the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic processes essentially disappears .",
    "let us summarize the physics in the new limit ( [ new ] ) before we go on to apply it to the anomalous charm production . in the combined limit ,",
    "the fock states are very compact and small .",
    "the transverse radius square of the states has a typical value of @xmath126 . because of the compactness of the fock states , intrinsic diagrams and extrinsic diagrams are of the same order .",
    "but the intrinsic diagrams can numerically dominate the extrinsic contributions because of the large combinatic factor .",
    "the heavy quark pair can be freed easily by stripping away the slow light spectator quark in the projectile through an interaction with the target .",
    "the hardness scale of the collision is given by @xmath126 .",
    "it is a soft peripheral process and so the cross section is large .",
    "this picture can provide a qcd framework for understanding the puzzling features of the large @xmath65 data mentioned in section 2 :    * ( a ) * the larger than expected charm structure function of the nucleon at large @xmath12 reported by emc @xcite can be understood by the large intrinsic charm contribution in the proton . in this case , @xmath13 gev@xmath14 ( for the data point with @xmath15 ) is fixed and the photon can resolve the charm quark easily . but as discussed above , the intrinsic production of the charm pair at large @xmath0 ( which is nearly twice of @xmath12 ) can numerically dominate the usual extrinsic production considered in pgf calculation and boost up the charm structure function a lot .    *",
    "( b ) * the longitudinally polarized @xmath23 at large @xmath10 in @xmath22 collisions has a natural explanation by the new production mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the dominant contributions to the polarization of @xmath23 at large @xmath0 are the intrinsic diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "the initial state pion valence quarks naturally have opposite helicities .",
    "there is a factor @xmath127 enhancement for the emission of transversely polarized gluon with same sign of helicity as the radiated quark .",
    "thus the two gluons coupled to the charm pair have opposite helicity . in order to form a bound state ,",
    "the transverse momenta of the gluons and thus of the charm pair should be small . in that case ,",
    "the initial @xmath128 and thus the formed @xmath23 is in longitudinally polarized state . here , we have made the assumption that the formation of the @xmath23 through the radiation of an extra gluon does not change the polarization of the charm quarks . in the large @xmath0 limit",
    ", the radiated gluon must be soft and this justifies our assumption .",
    "the counting rules in powers of @xmath129 are presented in ref.@xcite . the cross section for producing a longitudinally polarized ( fig .",
    "12a ) and a transversely polarized ( fig .",
    "12b ) @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "we find that the basic reason for the dominance of the intrinsic polarization amplitude ( fig .",
    "12a ) is that it allows two helicity flips of the heavy quarks , each contributing a power of @xmath132 in our analysis .",
    "thus , the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath23 at large @xmath10 is mainly due to intrinsic charm production mechanisms .    *",
    "( c ) * the anomalous double @xmath23 production can be understood qualitatively by considering intrinsic production as shown in fig .",
    "the two @xmath23 s produced as shown in the diagram clearly are strongly correlated .",
    "the cross section for freeing the pairs becomes large at large @xmath10 as it is a soft peripheral scattering from the target .",
    "this helps to explain why the @xmath23 pairs produced at large @xmath10 only .",
    "intrinsic charm production ( fig .",
    "13 ) has another nice feature .",
    "the total transverse momentum square of the @xmath23 pair is of the order of @xmath133 only , _",
    "i.e. _ , of the same order as that of the light quarks . however , the individual @xmath23 s can have transverse momenta up to the mass scale @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , if one uses the measured mean value of @xmath10 , which is 0.53 , from the na3 280 gev beam data and the measured mean transverse momentum of the individual @xmath23 s , @xmath134 gev , one gets @xmath135 gev which is close to the measured value of @xmath136 gev .",
    "obviously , one can not take this number too seriously .",
    "nevertheless , it indicates that all these features fit nicely with the data and the proposed new mechanisms may play an important role in double @xmath23 production .    *",
    "( d ) * the leading charm asymmetry has been studied in detail by r. vogt and s. j. brodsky @xcite using a two - component model .",
    "the first component is the usual leading twist fusion process while the second component is based on the model discussed above .",
    "in the usual leading twist fusion subprocess , there is a finite probability that the produced charm quark will combine with a spectator valence quark in the final state to produce a leading hadron .",
    "such final state coalescence mechanisms have been incorporated into pythia , a monte carlo program based on the lund string model @xcite . in that model , the  string acceleration \" of slow heavy quarks by fast valence quarks can boost the fast charm rate .",
    "however , such a mechanism overestimates the observed asymmetry @xmath137 at low @xmath10 .",
    "the lund string model is strictly a final state coalescence .",
    "however , the model we propose is an initial state coalescence .",
    "the pion can fluctuate into higher fock states as shown in fig .",
    "all the partons have nearly the same velocity in order to minimize the invariant mass of the state . as the charm and the valence quark",
    "have the same rapidity , it is easy for them to coalesce to form a large @xmath36 meson state without paying much penalty .",
    "thus , it can produce a strong leading particle correlation at large @xmath10 .",
    "figure 15 shows the results of the two - component model .",
    "the parameter @xmath138 determines the relative importance of the leading twist and intrinsic charm components .",
    "all the calculations reproduce the general trend of the data .    *",
    "( e ) * the new production mechanisms have all the novel features observed in the nuclear dependence of @xmath23 production .",
    "qcd factorization is invalid in the combined limit since there is no relative suppression of interactions involving several partons in the projectile .",
    "the nuclear @xmath139-dependence is a function of @xmath10 rather than a function of @xmath64 of the target - parton momentum fraction . because of the rapid transverse size expansion of the spectators , production cross sections in nuclear targets becomes surface dominated at large @xmath0",
    "we have reviewed the experimental status of charm production at large @xmath0 and observed a lot of anomalous behaviors in this kinematic limit .",
    "both the leading charm asymmetry and the nuclear @xmath23 production show that factorization breaks down at large @xmath0 .",
    "higher twist effects becomes dominant because a new scale @xmath140 emerges , which reflects the small transverse size of the fock state , in the @xmath1 limit . in the combined limit ( [ new ] ) , the heavy quark pair can be freed easily as the coherence of the fock state is easily broken by soft interactions of finite transverse momentum because of the rapid expansion of the transverse size of the spectators .",
    "this new production mechanism helps to explain the anomalous phenomena observed at large @xmath0 .",
    "this new picture of hadron formation opens up a whole new avenue for studying the far - off - shell structure of hadrons .",
    "it is thus critical that a new measurement of the charm and beauty structure functions be performed in future experiments ."
