    "relying , in general , on photometric data tabulated in leda ( paturel et al .",
    "1997 ) , we select the nearby optical galaxies ( nog ) sample , a sample of 7076 galaxies which lie at @xmath2 , have recession velocities ( in the local group frame ) @xmath06000 km / s , and have corrected total blue magnitudes b@xmath314 mag . we have incorporated numerous new redshifts given by the optical redshift survey ( santiago et al .",
    "1995 ) , the updated zwicky catalog ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the newly completed pscz survey ( for which data have been kindly provided to us by william saunders ) .",
    "we select the sample attempting to tighten the selection criteria already used in the ors survey , specifically , by adopting a complementary approach to the construction of an all - sky optical galaxy sample . specifically ,",
    "we use , as photometric selection parameter , the total blue magnitudes , homogeneously transformed into the standard system of the rc3 catalogue and corrected for galactic extinction , internal extinction and k - dimming .",
    "this is meant to minimize systematic selection effects as a function of direction in the sky and , thus , provide a largely unbiased view of the galaxy distribution .",
    "we limit the sample to the depth of 6000 km / s in order to reduce the incompleteness in redshift and have a dense sampling of the galaxy density field . from the analysis of the behaviour of galaxy counts versus magnitude , we find that the nog is intrinsically complete down to its limiting magnitude b=14 mag .",
    "moreover , it has a good completeness in redshift ( @xmath498% ) .",
    "1 shows the nog galaxies and the iras 1.2 jy sample ( fisher et al .",
    "1995 ) limited to 6000 km / s , using flamsteed projections in galactic coordinates .",
    "the region devoid of galaxies is the zone of avoidance .",
    "similar , prominent structures stand out in these plots such as the densest part of the local supercluster at @xmath5 , @xmath6 with the virgo cluster at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the hydra - centaurus complex ( around @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , together with the contiguous telescopium - pavo - indus supercluster ( from @xmath11 , @xmath12 to @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the perseus - pisces supercluster ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "there are also pronounced voids such as the local void , which covers a large part of the sky between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the orion - taurus void ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , and the eridanus void ( around @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "since we are interested in describing the galaxy density field also on small scales , we identify galaxy systems in the nog by means of the hierarchical method ( according to the precepts given by gourgoulhon et al .",
    "1992 ) and percolation _ friends of friends _ method ( with the distance and velocity link parameters chosen as in ramella et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we obtain two homogeneous catalogs of loose groups which turn out to be substantially consistent . containing about 500 groups with at least three members , they are among the largest catalogs of groups presently available in the literature .",
    "most of the nog galaxies ( @xmath460% ) are found to be members of galaxy pairs ( @xmath4580 for a total of @xmath415% of the galaxies ) or groups with at least three members ( @xmath4500 groups comprising @xmath445% of the galaxies ) .",
    "about 40% of the galaxies are left ungrouped ( field galaxies ) .",
    "the nog groups will be used to remove non - linearities in the peculiar velocity field on small scales . to correct the redshift - distances of field galaxies and groups on large scales",
    ", we shall apply models of the peculiar velocity field , following the approach described in marinoni et al .",
    "we shall use the locations of individual galaxies and groups calculated in real - distance space to calculate the selection function of the nog sample ( following the approach described in marinoni et al .",
    "1999 ) and to reconstructed the galaxy density field ( see the paper by marinoni et al . in the same volume ) .",
    "though being limited to a depth of 6000 km / s , the nog covers interesting regions of galaxy and mass overdensities of the local universe , such as the `` great attractor '' region and the perseus - pisces supercluster .",
    "compared to previous all - sky optical and iras galaxy samples ( e.g. the optical redshift survey by santiago et al .",
    "1995 , the iras 1.2 jy by fisher et al .",
    "1995 , the pscz by saunders et al .",
    "1999 ) , the nog provides a denser sampling of the galaxy density field in the nearby universe .",
    "nog contains 11% more galaxies than the ors limited to 6000 km / s and 35% more galaxies than the pscz limited to the same depth , although it covers about 3/4 of the solid angle covered by the pscz .",
    "besides , nog delineates overdensity regions with a greater contrast than iras samples do ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    given its large sky coverage , its high - density sampling , and the identification of galaxy systems ,",
    "the nog is well suited to mapping the cosmography of the nearby universe , studying the clustering properties and tracing the optical galaxy density field ( also on small scales ) to be compared with the iras galaxy density field .",
    "local galaxy density parameters derived from the nog are meant to be used in statistical investigations of environmental effects on nearby galaxies , along the lines followed by giuricin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) on the basis of the nbg ( tully 1988 ) sample ."
