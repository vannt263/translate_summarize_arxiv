    "the nearest powerful extragalactic radio source is centaurus  a ( cen  a ) , which is emitted by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of the elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 . unlike most elliptical galaxies , ngc 5128 hosts a prominent dust lane that is thought to have been created by a recent merger with a gas - rich disk galaxy ( israel 1998 ) , which also provided the fuel for the agn outburst . at a distance of 3.7 mpc from the earth ,",
    "cen  a provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of agn driven radio jets .",

    "the subgroup spans a region @xmath6 kpc in radius around ngc 5128 , which at this close distance covers many degrees in the southern sky .",
    "cen  a is similarly impressive at radio wavelengths , showing multiple synchrotron emitting lobes , ranging in scale from a pair of inner lobes at a distance of 5 kpc from the agn , to a single northern middle lobe at a distance of 2530 kpc , and to a pair of outer lobes at a distance of 100 kpc from the nucleus ( morganti et al .  1999 ,",

    "furthermore , the bent morphologies of the jets , as well as their association with x - ray emitting knots and regions of bright optical and uv emission , all suggest a complex history of interactions between the jets and the surrounding gaseous environment ( rejkuba et al .  2001 , 2002 , 2004 , fassett & graham 2000 , graham & fassett 2002 , kraft et al .",

    "such agn feedback is widely invoked in theoretical models both to explain the overall history of cosmic star formation , as well as to explain the properties of individual agn host galaxies and their surroundings . on cosmic scales",
    ", it is thought that the primary impact of agn is to decrease star formation by removing gas from galaxies and heating the gas that surrounds them .",
    "such `` negative feedback '' is required to explain three key cosmological trends : ( i ) the overall star formation rate has dropped since @xmath7 , 4 gyr after the big bang ( hopkins & beacom 2006 , karim et al .",
    "2011 ) ; ( ii ) the rate of star formation peaked first in the most massive galaxies and later in smaller galaxies ( e.g. , cowie et al .",

    "note that this latter figure implies that the physical conditions required in the simulations to trigger star formation still hold this far away from the jet , because the inner filament is near the edge of the radio jet .",
