    "<S> the next generation of cmb experiments should get a better handle on cosmological parameters by mapping the weak lensing deflection field , which is separable from primary anisotropies thanks to the non - gaussianity induced by lensing . </S>",
    "<S> however , the generation of perturbations in the early universe also produces a level of non - gaussianity which is known to be small , but can contribute to the anisotropy trispectrum at the same level as lensing . in this work , we study whether the primordial non - gaussianity can mask the lensing statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we concentrate only on the `` temperature quadratic estimator '' of lensing , which will be nearly optimal for the planck satellite , and work in the flat - sky approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that primordial non - gaussianity contaminates the deflection field estimator by roughly @xmath0% at large angular scales , which represents at most a 10% contribution , not sufficient to threaten lensing extraction , but enough to be taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> epsf    _ introduction  _ cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies are of considerable interest for cosmology because after cleaning the observed temperature and polarization maps from various foregrounds , one obtains a picture of cosmological perturbations on our last - scattering surface . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectra of primary anisotropies are related to various cosmological parameters , and depend on the physical evolution mainly before the time of decoupling ( and also , more weakly , on its recent evolution , through the integrated sachs - wolfe effect and the angular diameter  </S>",
    "<S> redshift relation ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it was realized recently that cmb anisotropies encode even more cosmological information than expected , because it should be possible in a near future to measure the deflection field caused by the weak lensing of cmb photons by the large scale structure of the neighboring universe at typical redshifts @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the power spectrum of the deflection field encodes some information concerning structure formation mainly in the linear or quasi - linear regime , and is therefore extremely useful for measuring parameters like the total neutrino mass or the dark energy equation - of - state , which mildly affect the primary anisotropy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , the next generation of cmb experiments could output for free a large scale structure ( lss ) power spectrum , without suffering like galaxy redshift surveys from the systematics induced by mass - to - light bias and by strong non - linear corrections on small scales at @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several methods on the market for extracting the deflection map @xcite , all based on the non - gaussianity induced by lensing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these methods start from the assumption that both the primary anisotropies and the deflection field are gaussian ; they also assume that the noise present in the temperature and polarization maps is gaussian and uncorrelated with the signal .    </S>",
    "<S> none of these assumptions is exactly true . </S>",
    "<S> amblard et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite already estimated to which extent the lensing extraction will be biased , first , by the non - gaussianity of the lensing potential caused by the non - linear growth of matter perturbations on small scales , and second , by the imperfect cleaning of the cmb maps from the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect , which also has a blackbody spectrum , induces non - gaussianity , and features spatial correlations with many of the structures responsible for the lensing . </S>",
    "<S> both effects were found to be relevant ( i.e. , to induce a significant bias in the estimators ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are small enough to preserve the validity of the method .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this work is to relax the first of the previous assumptions , and to consider realistic situations , in which one can not avoid a small level of non - gaussianity to be produced in the early universe . non - gaussianity emerges as a key observable to discriminate among competing scenarios for the generation of cosmological perturbations and is one of the primary targets of present and future cmb satellite missions @xcite . indeed , despite the simplicity of the inflationary paradigm @xcite , the mechanism by which cosmological curvature perturbations are generated is not yet established . in the standard slow - roll scenario associated to one - single field models of inflation , </S>",
    "<S> the observed density perturbations are due to fluctuations of the inflaton field itself when it slowly rolls down along its potential . in the curvaton mechanism  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the final curvature perturbation is produced from an initial isocurvature perturbation associated with the quantum fluctuations of a light scalar field ( other than the inflaton ) , the curvaton , whose energy density is negligible during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> recently , other mechanisms for the generation of cosmological perturbations have been proposed , the inhomogeneous reheating scenario @xcite , the ghost inflationary scenario @xcite , and the d - cceleration scenario  @xcite , just to mention a few . </S>",
    "<S> single - field slow - roll inflationary model inflation itself produces a negligible amount of non - gaussianity , and the dominant contribution comes from the evolution of the ubiquitous second - order perturbations after inflation . </S>",
    "<S> however , alternative models for the generation of perturbations might produce much stronger primordial non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , non - gaussianity in the cmb maps from primordial fluctuations could mask the non - gaussianity from lensing distortions . </S>",
    "<S> we will see later that if one expands the power spectrum of the lensing estimator in powers of the gravitational potential @xmath3 , the contribution from primordial non - gaussianity appears at the same order as the lensing power spectrum itself . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a precise computation is needed in order to understand whether the primordial non - gaussianity could affect lensing extraction .    _ lensing extraction with quadratic estimators  </S>",
    "<S> _ weak lensing induces a deflection field @xmath4 , i.e. , a mapping between the direction of a given point on the last scattering surface and the direction in which we observe it . at leading order @xcite </S>",
    "<S> this deflection field can be written as the gradient a lensing potential , @xmath5 .    in the limit of gaussian primordial fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> the unlensed anisotropies obey gaussian statistics , and in the flat - sky approximation their two - dimensional fourier modes are fully described by the power spectra @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 belong to the @xmath9 basis . </S>",
    "<S> weak lensing correlates the lensed multipoles @xcite according to @xmath10 where the average holds over different realizations ( or different hubble patches ) of a given cosmological model with fixed primordial spectrum and background evolution ( i.e. fixed cosmological parameters ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this average , the lensing potential is also kept fixed by convention , which makes sense because the cmb anisotropies and lss that we observe in our past light - cone are statistically independent , at least as long as we neglect the integrated sachs - wolfe effect . </S>",
    "<S> the above function @xmath11 is defined in @xcite and takes a simple form in the case @xmath12 : @xmath13 our study will be based on the quadratic estimator method of hu & okamoto @xcite ( which is equivalent in terms of precision to the alternative iterative estimator method of hirata & seljak @xcite as long as cmb experiments will make noise - dominated measurements of the b - mode , i.e. , at least for the next decade ) . by inverting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ab ] ) , one builds a quadratic combination of the temperature and polarization observed fourier modes @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and in which the normalization condition @xmath16^{-1}\\ ] ] ensures that @xmath17 is an unbiased estimator of the lensing potential : @xmath18 note that , so far , the coefficients @xmath19 are still arbitrary . from the observed temperature and polarization maps , one could compute each mode of @xmath17 and obtain various estimates of the deflection modes , precise up to cosmic variance and experimental errors . in order to quantify the total error , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to compute the power spectra of the quadratic estimators @xmath20 where the average is now taken over both cmb and lss realizations , since @xmath21 is also a stochastic quantity . in this definition , </S>",
    "<S> the power spectra are written with a superscript @xmath22 in order to be distinguished from the actual power spectrum of the true deflection field . these spectra feature the four - point correlation function of the observed ( lensed ) fourier modes @xmath23 , which should be expanded at order two in @xmath21 in order to catch the leading non - gaussian contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the four - point correlation functions are composed as usual of a connected and an unconnected piece . </S>",
    "<S> the connected piece is by definition a function of the power spectra @xmath24 in which we now include all sources of variance : cosmic variance , lensing contribution and experimental noise . </S>",
    "<S> the unconnected piece is a function of the same spectra plus the deflection spectrum @xmath25 , and as usual it can be decomposed in three terms corresponding to the different pairings of the four indices @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term leads to considerable simplifications when it is plugged into the expression of the quadratic estimator power spectrum , and the result is simply @xmath32 , as one would expect naively from squaring eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ avd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other terms lead to more complicated expressions that we will write as two noise terms : @xmath33^{ab}_{l } + n^{ab}_{l}~ , \\label{clddab}\\ ] ] which represent respectively the contribution from the connected piece and from the two non - trivial terms of the unconnected piece @xcite ( later , we will give the exact expressions in the case @xmath34 ) . in order to get an efficient estimator </S>",
    "<S> , we should adopt the set of coefficients @xmath35 which minimize the noise terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is actually much easier to minimize the connected term only , which leads to the simple results @xmath36^{aa}_{l } = a^{aa}_l\\ ] ] for @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> with such a choice , the unconnected piece contribution @xmath39 can be shown to be smaller than @xmath40 , but not completely negligible @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the various estimators @xmath17 can be constructed for each pair of modes , except for the pair @xmath41 , because the spectrum @xmath42 is dominated by lensing at least on small scales , which invalidates the present method . </S>",
    "<S> so , the quadratic estimator technique would not be optimal for long - term cmb experiments with cosmic - variance - dominated measurement of the @xmath43 mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for an experiment of given sensitivity , the five other estimators can be combined into a final minimum variance estimator , which gives the best possible estimate of the deflection field by weighing each estimator accordingly to its noise level . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the planck satellite @xcite is slightly above the threshold for successful lensing extraction , but only at intermediate angular scales , and with essentially all the signal coming from the @xmath44 estimator . </S>",
    "<S> the following generation of experiments  such as the cmbpol or inflation probe project @xcite  should obtain the lowest noise level from the @xmath45 estimator @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarized here the quadratic estimator method , which assumes that both the primary anisotropies and the lensing potential are gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> we will now study the impact of primordial non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> this program is numerically cumbersome , and we will only concentrate on the @xmath44 estimator , which is the only relevant one for planck , while sticking to the flat - sky approximation in which numerical computations are much quicker .    _ </S>",
    "<S> contributions from primordial non - gaussianity  _ the two - dimensional fourier modes of both temperature anisotropies and the lensing potential can be related to the stochastic three - dimensional modes of the primordial gravitational potential @xmath46 , multiplied by a transfer function which accounts for its time - evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the fact of writing a unique stochastic function can bring some confusion , because the modes @xmath46 which appear in the cmb and lensing expressions represent fluctuations at very different redshifts : the first ones before decoupling , the second at @xmath47 , i.e. in the neighboring universe . </S>",
    "<S> so , as long as we neglect the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , it is convenient to introduce two statistically independent functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , sharing the same statistical properties , but sourcing respectively @xmath50 and @xmath51 </S>",
    "<S> .    the true non - gaussian potential @xmath52 ( x = cmb or lss ) can be expanded in real space in powers of a gaussian potential @xmath53 . in fourier space and at order three , </S>",

    "<S> they are proportional to the dimensionless parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretically predicted parameter @xmath56 appears as a kernel in fourier space , rather than a constant , in most of the scenarios for the generation of the cosmological perturbations , while theoretical predictions for the parameter @xmath57 are still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> could be rather sizeable in some scenarios for the generation of the cosmological perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the curvaton scenario @xcite @xmath57 can be as large as @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> ] this gives rise to an angular modulation of the quadratic non - linearity , which might be used to search for specific signatures of inflationary non - gaussianity in the cmb . in this paper , however , we restrict ourselves to the simplest case and assume @xmath56 and @xmath57 as mere phenomenological multiplicative constants . under this assumption , </S>",
    "<S> the _ wmap _ team has measured the bispectrum to obtain the tightest limit to date , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) @xcite . on the other hand , no observational bound has been set on @xmath57 from the observed trispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can simply notice from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ expansion ] ) that the small parameter @xmath61 contributes at the same order as @xmath62 : so , by comparing with the @xmath56 bound , it is likely that values of order @xmath63 are still allowed by the data .    </S>",
    "<S> as far as lower bounds are concerned , one should keep in mind that although single - field slow - roll inflation itself produces a negligible amount of non - gaussianity , the dominant contribution comes from the evolution of the ubiquitous second - order perturbations after inflation . </S>",
    "<S> this effect _ must exist _ regardless of the inflationary model , setting the minimum level of non - gaussianity in the cosmological perturbations at order @xmath64 .         in order to evaluate the impact of these extra contributions on the power spectrum @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> , we should first recompute the four - point functions @xmath66 , working as before at order six in the gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> non - zero contributions can arise only from terms with an even number of @xmath67 and @xmath68 factors . </S>",
    "<S> the standard calculation of the previous section included terms in which either two multipoles were lensed at order one in @xmath51 , or one multipole was lensed at order two ( the later terms contributes only to the connected piece ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we should now consider terms in which :    * the four multipoles are unlensed , but two of them include the term @xmath69 , * the four multipoles are unlensed , one of them includes the term @xmath70 , * one of the four multipoles is lensed at order one in @xmath51 , which includes the term @xmath71 .      </S>",
    "<S> the numerical integration of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fr ] ) could be exceedingly long , due to the four - dimensional integral in fourier space ( which converges only when the upper bound of integration is taken around the silk - damping cut - off , @xmath89 ) and of the two - dimensional integral in @xmath90 space . fortunately , the second integral can be limited to values of @xmath90 close to the comoving distance to the last - scattering surface , far from which @xmath91 is negligible . here </S>",
    "<S> , we will integrate @xmath92 from @xmath93 to @xmath94 with a conservative step @xmath95 ( where @xmath96 stands for conformal time , @xmath97 is evaluated today , and @xmath98 is the conformal time at recombination , defined as the peak of the visibility function ) .    the integration in @xmath99-space can be sped up by taking into account various symmetries , and also by noting that for the terms @xmath87 and @xmath43 the integral over @xmath100 and @xmath101 are separable . then , the integration effectively reduces to a two - dimensional one . for these terms </S>",
    "<S> , we integrate first on @xmath100 , then on @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and obtain the full result in few minutes . the term @xmath88 and the lensing term require a real four - dimensional integral and more cpu time . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the quantities to integrate are very smooth in @xmath99-space , and one can considerably reduce the computing time by choosing a large step without loosing precision . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from the primordial non - gaussianity terms @xmath77 and @xmath43 scale respectively like @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and here they are shown for @xmath114 .    </S>",

    "<S> the noise induced by primordial non - gaussianity is responsible for roughly @xmath0% of the amplitude of the estimator @xmath115 in the range @xmath116 : so , around 10% for the largest possible value of @xmath117 , and around 0.1% for standard slow - roll inflationary models . in the range @xmath118 , </S>",
