    "modified gravity models attract interests of researchers as an alternative to explain the cosmic accelerated expansion of the universe without introducing the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory was constructed by horndeski @xcite for the first time , and it was rediscovered in @xcite as a generalization of the galileon theories @xcite .",
    "in addition to the possibility of constructing cosmological models with an accelerated expansion , it possesses the following interesting features .",
    "the equation of motion are the second order differential equation .",
    "then , an additional degree of freedom is not introduced , which is advantageous to avoid the appearance of ghosts .",
    "furthermore , the galileon theory is endowed with the vainshtein mechanism @xcite , which is a screening mechanism useful to evade the local gravity constraints . in the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory ,",
    "the vainshtein mechanism may work depending on the model parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the planck satellite have shown that the primordial perturbations obey almost the gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "even if the initial perturbations were completely gaussian , the non - gaussian nature in the density perturbations is induced in the large scale structure formation through the nonlinear fluid equations under the influence of the gravitational force .",
    "the bispectrum is often used to characterize the nonlinear and non - gaussian nature in the density perturbations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , bispectrum and nonlinear features in the structure formation in the galileon models have been investigated @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our investigation on the bispectrum in the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory in order to illuminate characteristic features in a wide class of modified gravity models , regarding it as an effective theory .",
    "an advantage of such a general theory is that we can discuss general features of a wide class of modified gravity models , which is useful to forecast their detectability in future large surveys .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the bispectrum in the matter density perturbations which is induced in the large scale structure formation after the matter dominated epoch .",
    "we present an expression of the bispectrum in the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory based on the standard density perturbation theory , which is written in term of a kernel of the second order of perturbations .",
    "we find that the kernel is characterized by only _",
    "one _ parameter , which is determined by the solutions of the linear density perturbations , the hubble parameter , and the other function of the background universe that describes the nonlinear interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we apply the standard perturbation theory to the most general second - order scalar - tensor theory that may possess the vainshtein mechanism , and find the solution of the second - order of density perturbations . in section 3",
    ", we present the expression of the bispectrum of the density perturbations , and investigate the influence of the modification of gravity .",
    "the results are applied to a simple kinetic gravity braiding model in section 4 .",

    "this theory is found in @xcite as a generalization of the galileon theory , but the equivalence with the horndeski s theory is shown in @xcite .",
    "we consider a spatially flat expanding universe and the metric perturbations in the newtonian gauge , whose line element is written as @xmath14 we define the scalar field with perturbations by @xmath15 with which we introduce @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the case that the vainshtein mechanism may work as a screening mechanism .",

    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly review the method and the results ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the basic equations of the gravitational and scalar fields are derived on the basis of the quasi - static approximation of the subhorizon scales .",
    "the models that the vainshtein mechanism may work can be found as follows .",
    "the equations are derived by keeping the leading terms schematically written as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes a spatial derivative and @xmath20 does any of @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "such terms make a leading contribution of the order @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a typical horizon length scale . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , from the gravitational field equation , we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the matter density , @xmath28 is the matter density contrast , and we defined @xmath29 from the equation of motion of the scalar field , we have @xmath30 where we defined @xmath31 the coefficients such as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc . , that appear in the field equations here and hereafter are defined in appendix a. @xmath35 are the coefficients of the linear , quadratic and cubic terms of @xmath22 , @xmath21 , @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we find the solution in terms of the perturbative expansion , which can be written in a form @xmath47 where @xmath20 denotes @xmath48 , or @xmath23 , and @xmath49 denotes the @xmath50-th order solution of the expansion .",
    "now we start from the first order equations , which can be easily solved as follows . from equations ( [ se14 ] ) , ( [ se15 ] ) , and ( [ seomf ] ) , we have @xmath51 which give the solutions @xmath52 where we defined @xmath53",
    "the first order equation of ( [ se11 ] ) is @xmath54 substituting ( [ se11fo ] ) and ( [ eqphifo ] ) into the first order equation of ( [ se12 ] ) , we have @xmath55 where we defined @xmath56 this second rank differential equation has the growing mode solution @xmath57 and the decaying mode solution @xmath58 . neglecting the decaying mode solution",

    "the first order solutions for the other quantities can be expressed in terms of @xmath63 .",

    ", the effect of the scalar field perturbations would be negligible , and we may naturally expect that the matter density perturbations grow in the same way as those in the general relativity . in this case , we may write the initial conditions , @xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath62 .    interestingly , we can show that ( [ kappasolution ] ) generally reduces to @xmath92 for all the time .",
    "substituting the expression ( [ solutiondelta2 ] ) into ( [ eqdel1 ] ) with regarding @xmath94 and @xmath95 as unknown functions , we have the following equations @xmath96 these equations can be solved , to give the general solutions @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are constants , and @xmath100 is given by the right hand side of ( [ lambdasolution ] ) .",
