    "magnetic fields exist in all gravitationally bound structures in space , from planets and stars to galaxies and clusters .",

    "is the claimed detection of a magnetic field in the intergalactic space @xcite based on non - observation of gev @xmath0-rays expected to accompany tev blazars .",
    "further , @xcite recently reported hints of left - handed magnetic helicity on @xmath1 mpc scales measured using @xmath0-ray data from the large area telescope onboard the fermi satellite @xcite .",
    "detecting a pmf would bring us closer to a complete theory of the early universe @xcite .",
    "candidate mechanisms for generation of a pmf include inflationary scenarios @xcite and phase transitions @xcite .",
    "a pmf would imprint signatures in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) carrying valuable clues about its origin .",
    "fields produced in phase transitions have most of the power concentrated near a small cutoff scale set by the plasma conductivity @xcite , with practically no strength on cosmological scales that would translate into observable correlations in cmb temperature and polarization . instead",
    ", cmb constraints on such fields come from spectral distortions caused by the magnetic energy being damped into plasma on small scales @xcite and from the enhanced recombination rates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , cmb temperature and polarization fluctuations provide competitive bounds on a _ scale - invariant _ pmf @xcite .",
    "inflation naturally generates a scale - invariant magnetic field , but the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action implies an almost complete dilution of its amplitude .",
    "one way to circumvent this conclusion is to break the conformal invariance , _",
    "e.  g. _ by coupling the electromagnetic field to the inflaton @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggested that a sizeable magnetic field can be generated during a phase of slow - roll inflation by the conformal anomaly , without the need for breaking the conformal invariance in the classical action .",
    "the physical magnetic field strength scales with the expansion factor @xmath2 as @xmath3 , where * b * is the `` comoving '' strength .",
    "a common measure of a tangled pmf is its comoving amplitude smoothed over a length @xmath4 , @xmath5 . for scale - invariant fields ,",
    "this quantity is independent of @xmath4 and is the same as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the total magnetic energy density .",
    "thus , we will use @xmath8 to denote the strength of a scale - invariant pmf .",
    "recently released planck data limits @xmath9 to a few nano - gauss ( ng ) @xcite , although these results assume initial conditions in which the magnetic stress - energy is compensated by that of the surrounding fluid .",
    "there are additional modes , such as the `` passive mode '' @xcite generated prior to neutrino decoupling , and the so - called `` inflationary magnetic mode ''",
    "@xcite produced during the inflation .",
    "the amplitudes of these modes depend on the details of the inflationary magnetogenesis and accounting for them can significantly affect the cmb constraints @xcite .",
    "similar , _",
    "i.  e. _ a few ng , level constraints on @xmath9 were obtained by @xcite from lyman-@xmath10 spectra @xcite .",
    "the bounds mentioned above are based on the effects of the magnetic filed stress - energy , which is _ quadratic _ in the magnetic field strength .",
    "since the cmb and matter power spectra are , in turn , quadratic in stress - energy , the pmf contribution to them scales as @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the pmf contribution to the cmb temperature and polarization spectra comes as a small addition to a stronger signal .",
    "thus , improving current cmb bounds on @xmath9 by an order of magnitude considering solely the effects of the magnetic stress - energy would require a @xmath12-fold improvement in the accuracy of the measured spectra and the theoretical modelling of all other sources that contribute to them .",
    "this will not happen in the foreseeable future .",
    "on the other hand , faraday rotation ( fr ) of cmb polarization is _ linear _ in @xmath9 and offers a way to detect sub - ng strength pmf with the next generation of experiments  @xcite .",
    "prior studies  @xcite provided estimates at a single frequency and , while improvements due to measurements at more frequencies  @xcite were considered , they were not studied with due care until now . in this work ,",
    "we generalize the estimator of the fr angle at a single frequency used in  @xcite to that of a rotation measure that appropriately accounts for the covariance of measurements of the fr at multiple frequencies .",
    "when cmb radiation passes through ionized regions permeated by magnetic fields , its polarization is rotated by an angle @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the direction of the line of sight , @xmath15 is the differential optical depth , @xmath16 is the detector frequency , @xmath17 is the comoving magnetic field strength , and @xmath18 is the comoving length element along the photon trajectory .",
    "measurements of fr at different frequencies probe the same rotation measure ( rm ) , which is the quantity of interest for constraining the pmf .",
    "( [ alpha - fr ] ) implies that a significant rm can be produced by a small pmf over a large distance , which is the case at recombination , or by a larger magnetic field over a smaller path , which is the case inside our galaxy .",
    "the latter acts as noise in the estimates of the rm due to a pmf and was studied in @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of cmb polarization is aided by separating it into parity - even and parity - odd patterns  the so - called e- and b - modes  @xcite .",
    "e - modes are expected , since a non - zero intensity quadrupole at recombination necessarily leads to their generation via thomson scattering , and have been observed @xcite .",
    "b - modes , on the other hand , can only be produced by sources with parity - odd components , such as gravitational waves @xcite , topological defects @xcite or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "fr converts some of the e - mode into b - mode , namely , for small rotation angles , the relation between the spherical harmonic coefficients of e , b and @xmath10 can be written as @xcite b_lm=2_lm_l m_lm e_l m _",

    "weak lensing ( wl ) of cmb by gravitational potentials along the line of sight also converts e- into b - mode @xcite , but couples the odd sums of the modes , making it orthogonal to the fr effect .",
    "( [ eq : blm ] ) implies correlations between multipoles of e- and b - modes .",
    "since the cmb temperature ( t ) and e are correlated , fr also correlates t with b. the rotation angle can be extracted from eb and tb correlations .",
    "given measurements of b- and e - modes at frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath22 , respectively , the quantity @xcite _ ll = 2_mm b^i_lme_lm^j * _ lmlm^lm ( 2l+1)(2l+1)c_l^eeh_ll^l [ alphallpr ] provides an unbiased estimator of @xmath25 at frequency @xmath26 .",

    "analogous quantities can also be constructed from products of t and b. hence , given maps of t , e and b at a number of frequencies ( labeled by indices @xmath30 ) , one considers contributions from quadratic combinations a \\{e^ib^j , b^ie^j , t^ib^j , b^it^j }  .",

    "the mode - coupling estimator primarily probes the largest scale features of the rm  most of the contribution to the snr comes from @xmath61 , or angular scales of about @xmath62 and larger .    to demonstrate the effect of combining information from multiple channels , we consider the 7 lowest frequency channels of the recently proposed polarized radiation imaging and spectroscopy mission ( prism ) @xcite with parameters listed in table  [ table : prism ] . adding prism s higher frequency channels increases the computational time with practically no improvement in the snr .",
    "we evaluate the snr for @xmath63 ng under different assumptions about the subtraction of the wl b - modes and the galactic rm . with a perfect subtraction of both ( @xmath64 ) ,",
    "the highest detection level is 1@xmath65 for the 36 ghz channel .",
    "however , combining the channels gives a 2.4@xmath65 detection .",
    "this reduces to about 1.9@xmath65 when there is no de - lensing ( @xmath66 ) or with a 10% residual contribution from the galactic rm ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we also found that a relatively modest 25% improvement in the resolution and the sensitivity of each of the 7 channels increases the snr from @xmath68 to @xmath69 in the @xmath64 case .",
    "it is interesting to explore how tight the constraints on pmf can become with experiments beyond prism .",
    "the snr depends on the frequencies , the noise and the resolution of the channels , as well as the quality of de - lensing and galactic rm subtraction .",

    "( [ sn - approx ] ) under different assumptions about de - lensing .",
    "one can see that wl subtraction does not significantly affect the rm studies with prism , which is also apparent from numbers in table  [ table : prism ] .",
    "this is because of the relatively low resolution and high noise levels of prism s low frequency channels .",
    "however , wl subtraction becomes increasingly more important at higher resolutions and lower noise levels , as in the case of the @xmath81 ghz reference channel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the detector noise @xmath93 is inversely proportional to the square root of the length of the observation and the number of detectors used in each channel .",
    "increasing the number of channels with comparable snr has a similar effect , except for the benefit of having the cross - channel correlations that do not depend on the detector noise .",
    "additionally , subtraction of various astrophysical foregrounds is greatly aided by having measurements at many frequencies .",
    "however , adding the cross - channel correlations to the same - channel correlations does not add new information about the primordial signal , since it is the same for all channels .",
    "thus , without the foregrounds and the noise , the snr from @xmath94 comparable channels would approximately scale as @xmath95 .",
    "theoretically , there is no limitation on the number of channels one can employ . in principle , it is possible to use measurements of fr to lower the bounds to @xmath96 ng or even lower .",
    "there would , of course , be serious technical challenges , not to mention the costs , when trying to fit together a significant number of high resolution low frequency channels . also , as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it is difficult to achieve sub - ng constraints on pmf without a substantial subtraction of the galactic rm .",
    "uncertainties in the currently available map of oppermann et al start at 5 rad / m@xmath97 near galactic poles and increase at latitudes closer to the galactic plane .",
    "uncertainties of that order may allow for a detection of @xmath63 ng , but certainly not a weaker pmf .",
    "this will improve with a larger number of observed extragalactic polarized sources .    in forecasts like ours",
    ", it is usually assumed that astrophysical foregrounds will be modelled well enough to make their contribution smaller than the detector noise . however , achieving this is the main challenge in cmb polarization studies , with the frequency dependence of the known types of foregrounds used to subtract them .",
    "the relevant foregrounds are of two types @xcite : emission from the milky way , which obscures cmb on large angular scales , and contamination from extragalactic sources , which affects the small scale measurements . as noted earlier , while the mode - coupling estimator probes the rm on large angular scales , the dominant contribution to the snr comes from eb correlations on angular scales of about @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , close to the peak of the e - mode polarization spectrum . on these scales , both the galactic emission and the extragalactic contribution are not at their strongest .",
    "one may wonder if the fr signal can be extracted by treating it as one of the frequency dependent components in the component separation algorithm .",
    "there is a reason why this may be difficult to implement .",
    "namely , unlike other foregrounds , the fr does not generate polarization ",
    "it rotates the polarization from existing sources .",
    "this would couple it to other polarized components in the component separation algorithm , making the relation between the components non - linear .",
    "one could ask if it is possible to extract the fr angle directly , by comparing polarization maps at low and high frequencies , as opposed to the mode - coupling approach discussed in this work . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this has not been seriously investigated and we leave this for a future study .",
