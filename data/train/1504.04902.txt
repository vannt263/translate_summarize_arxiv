    "ceres is the sole example of a dwarf planet in the inner solar system . far from being mere taxonomic information , this suggests the great impact its study can have on the understanding of planetary formation and evolution of the solar system .",
    "indeed , it was proposed that ceres origin could have been as a transneptunian object @xcite , later scattered to the main belt due to the giant planets migration predicted by the ` nice model ' @xcite . even if it was formed close to its current location",
    ", the dynamical history of the solar system must have left its signatures on ceres .",
    "these could include not only the late heavy bombardment features that might exist on its surface , but also the makeup of its volatiles , which could have been transported from the outer region .    since the 1970 s it has been speculated that ceres could contain water vapour , which was recently verified @xcite .",
    "although the water regime on this object is still unknown , some internal structure models suggest the existence of a water ice  or even a liquid water ",
    "layer @xcite .",
    "yet the very question of whether ceres underwent differentiation is open and , on the assumption of an affirmative answer , it is natural to ask if it ever had tectonics , what its geological evolution was , and if it is still active .",
    "inarguably nasa s _ dawn _ mission @xcite , which is currently orbiting the dwarf planet , will shed light on several open issues concerning ceres .    containing approximately one fifth of the whole main belt s mass , ceres",
    "is expected to have an equilibrium figure , i.e. a maclaurin or a jacobi ellipsoid .",
    "in fact , direct observations of ceres by means of adaptive optics indicate that it is an oblate spheroid @xcite",
    ". the precise knowledge of its size and shape is of utmost importance , for the models of density , internal structure and differentiation .",
    "the best ground - based technique for determining shape and size of a faraway object is the study of its shadow , cast by a star during an occultation . since the 1960 s occultations have provided measurements of hundreds of asteroids , thanks partially to the fruitful professional - amateur collaboration on the field .",
    "more recently , this technique has been applied to objects of the outer solar system and has unveiled outstanding features of distant bodies , e.g. the ring system around the centaur ( 10199 ) chariklo @xcite .    the first stellar occultation by ceres was observed in 1984 @xcite and led to the determination of its size to the precision of some kilometres , at a time when the uncertainties were often ten times larger . the high apparent brightness of ceres , as compared to most asteroids , imposes a somewhat strong constraint on the stars capable of causing a detectable magnitude drop when occulted . for instance",
    ", after the 1984 event , to our knowledge , only four stellar occultations have been observed @xcite .",
    "two of them had only two chords each , thus not sufficient for providing accurate results .",
    "the two remaining events , which occurred on 2010 august 17 and 2013 october 25 , are reported in the present work and are the first ones that used charged - couple devices ( ccd ) as recording systems . throughout the paper",
    "we shall refer to these events as the ` 2010 occultation ' and the ` 2013 occultation ' .",
    "both events were predicted by steve preston on behalf of the international occultation timing association , during routine prediction of asteroidal occultations of bright stars .    this work is organized as follows . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we analyse the 2010 and the 2013 occultations , respectively . in section 4",
    "we give the geocentric positions of ceres derived from the occultations .",
    "the comparison of our results to those in the literature is carried out in section 5 .",
    "as predicted , on 2010 august 17 ceres occulted the star tyc 6833 - 163 - 1 ( ucac4 313 - 111823 ) , which has magnitude @xmath2 and has the icrs position , based on ucac4 catalogue @xcite , to the date of occultation :    @xmath3    ]    observations were carried out in brazil from five different sites as displayed in table [ tab : obs-2010 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ceres-2010-map ] .",
    "the occultation was detected from four of them .",
    "the southern - most one ( ufsc ) had a negative chord .",
    "from the positive sites , the one named inpe started observing after the event was already in progress , due to technical difficulties , thus providing only the star s reappearance time ; the other three recorded the whole phenomenon .",
    "a remarkable circumstance of this event was the low velocity of ceres : only 3.9 km s@xmath4 in the plane of the sky .",
    "therefore , even exposures of a few seconds would translate in a relevant spatial resolution .",
    "all the observations were made through a sequence of images obtained with ccds .",
    "the times of each exposure were available on the header of each image with an internal accuracy of a few hundredths of a second .",
    "ceamig had only the integer part of the second available , due to the acquisition software used .",
    "the fraction of a second could be retrieved as described on the section  3.1 of @xcite ( which shall be referred as br13 hereafter ) .",
    "cycle times ( exposure plus read - out ) varied from 2 to 52 seconds , as can be verified on table  [ tab : obs-2010 ] , making it a heterogeneous set of observations and imposing an error of a few seconds for the ingress / egress times of some sites .
