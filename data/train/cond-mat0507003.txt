    "the past few years has seen a growth of interest in quantum phase transitions and the associated phenomenon of quantum criticality  @xcite .",
    "although quantum criticality develops at a zero - temperature phase transition , the ability of quantum criticality to profoundly modify the metallic properties of both d- and f - electron materials at a finite temperature has aroused intense interest .",
    "heavy electron materials have played a particularly important role in the study of quantum criticality , for these systems lie at the brink of antiferromagnetic instabilities  @xcite , and they are readily tuned to an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point . in the approach to a heavy electron quantum critical point , the characteristic energy scale of both the fermi liquid and the magnetic excitations appear to telescope to zero , as indicated by the appearance of @xmath1 scaling in inelastic neutron scattering , and the development of scaling in both the specific heat and resistivity , characterized by a single energy scale which goes to zero at the quantum critical point  @xcite .    the standard model for the development of magnetism in a fermi liquid , which describes the emergence of antiferromagnetism as a quantum spin density wave , is unable to account for the simultaneous collapse of both the fermi and magnetic energy scales at quantum criticality  @xcite .",
    "this suggests the need for a radically new mechanism for the emergence of magnetism in the heavy electron state .",
    "the solution of classical criticality required two steps : the formulation of a mean - field theory  provided by the landau - ginzburg theory  and then the application of the renormalization group to the fluctuations around the mean field .",
    "in the parallel study of quantum criticality , experiments suggest the need to search for a new class of mean - field theory that describes the emergence of magnetism in the heavy electron fluid .",
    "various new approaches have been explored , including the idea of local quantum criticality  @xcite , the notion that spin and charge separate at a quantum critical point  @xcite and the idea that magnetism develops out of the heavy fermion phase via an intermediate spin - liquid  @xcite .",
    "part of the difficulty in understanding the heavy electron quantum critical point stems from the confluence of two separate physical phenomena .",
    "if we consider the passage from the ordered antiferromagnet into the heavy electron paramagnet there are two processes to consider :    * the destruction of ordered magnetism and the associated divergence of spin fluctuations in both space and time , and * the formation of charged composite heavy electrons associated with the kondo quenching of the fluctuating spin degrees of freedom .    while a complete theory of heavy electron quantum criticality needs to unify these two phenomena , senthil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently suggested examining models in which these separate phenomena occur in isolation .",
    "they take the view that these two transitions may actually be physically separated by an intermediate spin liquid . even if this is not the case in practice",
    ", we can adopt their approach as a useful exercise to examine what changes in transport properties are expected to accompany the formation of charged heavy electrons .",
    "one of the interesting pieces of physics at a qcp is that the spin degrees of freedom transform from localized , magnetically polarized objects , into mobile charged fermions .",
    "very little is known about the transport anomalies that accompany this transformation .",
    "one proposal is that the hall conductivity of the fluid will jump  @xcite . at present , it is however , only possible to measure the change in the hall conductivity at a magnetically - induced quantum phase transition where recent measurements suggest that the differential hall conductivity jumps at a heavy electron quantum critical point  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the model for a heavy electron quantum critical point proposed by senthil _",
    "et al . _ and show how the d.c .",
    "transport properties show discontinuities at the transition .",
    "in particular the weak - field hall effect and the wiedemann - franz ratio would jump .",
    "by contrast the optical drude weight will be continuous through the transition and reflect a `` gossamer '' fermi - liquid state .",
    "our basic starting model is the large-@xmath0 fermionic treatment of the kondo heisenberg model  @xcite with @xmath0 spin components labeled by greek indices that run from @xmath2 to @xmath0 : @xmath3 where @xmath4 describe respectively the conduction band ( @xmath5 ) , the on - site kondo coupling between the local moment and the conduction band ( @xmath6 ) , and the super - exchange between neighboring spin sites ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "a vector potential has been introduced into the hopping matrix element : for a uniform vector potential , @xmath5 can be rewritten as @xmath8 , where the dispersion @xmath9 is the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons .",
    "the physics of this model depends on the ratio of @xmath10 . in the doniach scenario  @xcite for the kondo lattice , when @xmath11 , the spins antiferromagnetically order , and as @xmath12",
    "is increased , the antiferromagnetic state undergoes a transition to heavy electron paramagnet .",
    "the detailed physics of this quantum phase transition is an unsolved problem . in a fermionic mean - field approach , valid in the large-@xmath0 limit , antiferromagnetism at small @xmath12",
    "is replaced by a spin - liquid or valence - bond ground - state@xcite .",
    "although this model does not permit us to examine the destruction of magnetism by the kondo effect , it nevertheless affords the opportunity to examine the change in transport properties which accompany the formation of the heavy electron paramagnet .",
    "this is the topic of this paper .",
    "when we formulate the kondo heisenberg model as a functional integral , we can decouple the kondo and heisenberg terms into a `` slave boson '' and an rvb gauge field , as follows : @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 + \\frac{n\\bar v_{j}v_{j}}{j } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "fluctuations of this gauge field enforce the constraint that the spinon current flow between sites is zero .",
    "the mean - field theory of this model , requires an additional constraint term , as follows @xmath18 so that variations in @xmath19 enforce the constraint @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of f - electrons used to represent the large @xmath0 spin .",
    "there are two mean - field phases of interest ,    * a uniform rvb spin liquid phase where @xmath22 , but @xmath23 assumes a uniform value . in this phase",
    "the spinons , represented by @xmath24 fermions are unconfined , and have a dispersion determined by @xmath25 . * the heavy electron phase , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both finite and uniform .",
    "( a ) 3d triangular spin structure for which the uniform rvb phase is stable in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "( b ) the simpler 2d triangular lattice has the conceptual advantage that spin and diamagnetic parts of the magnetic field can be treated separately by considering fields parallel and perpendicular to the plane . ]    in this discussion , our main focus is on the transformation of the transport properties which occur at the second - order transition between these two phases . strictly speaking , stabilization of the uniform rvb phase against instabilities to valence bond states , flux phases or plaquet states",
    "requires the presence of additional frustrating interactions , such as bi - quadratic heisenberg couplings or spin - exchange terms around plaquets .",
    "our discussion will assume that the heisenberg terms are sufficiently frustrated to permit us to analyze a second - order between the two uniform phases .",
    "as a specific example , of such a model , we might consider a triangular crystal structure the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where frustration in the layers stabilizes the uniform solution .",
    "( to avoid a flux phase , we would need in addition , to include a ring exchange term around each rhombohedral plaquet . )",
    "it is conceptually easier in the model discussion we develop here , to take the two dimensional limit of this model .",
    "this has the conceptual advantage that magnetic field parallel to the layer couples only to the spin part of the hamiltonian , so that we can separate the spin effects of field tuning from the diamagnetic effects associated with a field perpendicular to the plane .    to discuss the transport",
    ", we shall suppose that there is weak site disorder in the conduction electron fluid , and weak bond- disorder in the spin liquid to provide an elastic scattering mechanism .",
    "in the spin - liquid phase , where @xmath28 , the @xmath29 field decouples from the external vector potential . just as the physical vector potential couples to currents of the conduction electrons , the @xmath29 field couples to `` currents '' of the f - spinons . for slow variations of these fields ,",
    "the effective action obtained by integrating out the fermions , will take the form @xmath30 .\\ ] ] in the relaxation time approximation the conductivities @xmath31 describe the drude response of the conduction and spinon fluid , to their respective gauge fields .",
    "the diagrams involved in the formal evaluation of these two quantities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "diagrams for the conductivities entering into the effective action .",
    "full propagators refer to conduction electron propagators @xmath32 , and dashed lines refer to f - electron propagators @xmath33 , ]    although the vector potential and the @xmath29 fields couple in an essentially identical way to their respective fluids , @xmath34 is not an external field like @xmath35 , but fluctuates around a mean value @xmath36 . fluctuations over this field guarantee the neutrality of the spin - liquid and preclude any flow of charge associated with the super - exchange couplings .",
    "the transition between the spin - liquid and the heavy electron state involves the development of a small slave boson amplitude via a second - order phase transition .",
    "this occurs when the free energy , @xmath37 , satisfies @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the density of conduction electrons , and the estimate of the integral has been made , assuming that the band - width @xmath40 of the conduction electrons is much greater than the band - width of the spin liquid .",
    "so , when @xmath41 , the spin liquid becomes unstable with respect to the heavy electron state .    on the heavy electron side of this transition we have @xmath42 and",
    "the dispersion of the unconfined spinons and electrons now become mixed , forming a quasiparticle dispersion of the form @xmath43 in general , the point where @xmath44 will in general be far from the fermi surface , so that for small @xmath45 , the fermi surfaces of the heavy electron fluid are essentially identical to conduction sea plus spin fluid .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a small slave boson amplitude leads to a non - trivial coupling between the physical vector potential @xmath46 and the gauge field @xmath34 , given by @xmath47 to understand this coupling , consider the physical electromagnetic gauge transformations in the heavy electron phase .",
    "we can always choose a gauge where @xmath48 is real .",
    "in the heavy electron phase the hybridization between the f - spinons and conduction electrons given by @xmath49 , means that invariance of the lagrangian only occurs if one carries out a single gauge transformation applied to both the f- and conduction fermions , i.e. the lagrangian is only invariant under a single joint gauge transformation @xmath50 this implies that when we expand the mean - field free energy in @xmath46 and @xmath34 , the free energy will be strictly a function of @xmath51 .",
    "so , to quadratic order in the fields , the full lagrangian for the gauge field couplings is @xmath52 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int \\frac{d\\omega}{2\\pi } a v^{2 } \\vert e \\vec{a } ( \\omega ) - \\vec { \\theta } ( \\omega)\\vert ^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     the hybridization @xmath45 induces a further response to an applied electromagnetic field that leads to an additional term to the physical conductivity illustrated here . ]",
    "the coupling term between the two fields is given by the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are respectively , the number density and effective mass of the conduction electrons , so that @xmath55 . in eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) we see that that both gauge fields , @xmath46 and @xmath34 , have developed a mass @xmath56 so that , at first sight , both the conduction fluid and the spin liquid have becomes superfluids .",
    "however , the linear coupling term @xmath57 between them ensures that , at long times , @xmath29 adapts to the value @xmath58 which minimizes the free energy .",
    "it is this term that gives charge to the f - electrons so that the supercurrents of conduction and f - electrons mutually screen one - another . from the gaussian coefficient of @xmath29",
    ", we see that the propagator associated with the @xmath29 field is @xmath59 indicating that the characteristic response rate of this field is given by @xmath60 this sets the rate at which the supercurrents in the f- and conduction fluid adapt to screen one another . on time - scales",
    "longer than @xmath61 , the fluid is a heavy paramagnet .",
    "one of the interesting consequences of the spin fluid acquiring a charge , is that the d.c .",
    "conductivity of the fluid must jump at the transition from spin to heavy electron liquid@xcite .",
    "when the spin liquid is neutral ( the @xmath62 phase ) , the d.c .",
    "conductivity is simply given by the conduction electron component @xmath63 however , once the spins acquire a charge in the heavy electron phase then the spinon fluid contributes directly to the d.c . conductivity @xmath64    by contrast , we expect the thermal conductivities to be unchanged by the transition , because thermal currents of the spin liquid do not couple to the gauge fields . if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the thermal conductivities of the conduction and spin fluids just before the transition , then the thermal conductivity of the heavy electron fluid will be given by @xmath67 on either side of the transition . from this discussion",
    ", we see that at transition from heavy electron fluid to spin liquid the wiedemann - franz ratio will jump from the standard value @xmath68 in the heavy electron fluid , to the larger value @xmath69 \\ ; , \\ ] ] when the spin liquid becomes neutral .",

    "we have have omitted terms of order @xmath73 in the denominator of the second term . from this",
    ", we see that the optical conductivity acquires a new drude peak at low energies , of width @xmath74 , weight @xmath75 .",
    "the zero frequency limit of this expression is indeed @xmath76@xcite .",
    "to discuss the hall conductivity , we need to consider the response of the system to crossed magnetic and electric fields which implies that we must consider the cubic interaction terms between the gauge fields .",
    "the hall response requires us to to consider configurations of the vector potential containing a spatially uniform electric component , @xmath77 and a time - independent magnetic component @xmath78 , such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the residual `` probe '' part of the vector potential that is neither constant in space or time . in fourier space , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the field used to probe the current .",
    "we also need to consider the analogous gauge fields that constrain the circulating currents in the spin liquid .",
    "the crossed gauge fields will now introduce a cubic term @xmath85 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 are related to the three - point current fluctuations of the conduction and spin fluids respectively , @xmath89 here the currents , @xmath90 are the `` paramagnetic '' current fluctuations of the conduction electrons and spin liquid , respectively . in an isotropic conduction fluid , where the hall conductance @xmath91 gauge invariance requires that @xmath92\\cr & = & - \\alpha \\omega \\biggl ( q_a \\delta_{bc } - q_b \\delta_{ac}\\biggr ) a^{e}_{b}a^{b}_{c } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & - q_{abc}a^{e}_{b}a^{b}_{c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that we can identify the coefficient of the hall conductance @xmath93 in the spin liquid phase , the absence of any coupling between the two gauge fields guarantees that @xmath91 is the hall response of the combined system .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that @xmath94 describes the analogous quantity for the spin liquid . in a simple relaxation time approximation",
    ", the above coefficients can be related to fermi surface integrals of the quasiparticle mean - free path around the two dimensional fermi surface , given by  @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the mean - free paths of the conduction and spin quasiparticles respectively .",
    "now suppose we cross through the quantum phase transition into the heavy electron paramagnet . in this case",

    "this jump in the hall response can be traced back to the fact that the previously neutral heavy - electron currents now become charged . at a zero field quantum critical point ,",
    "the linear hall current induced by a tiny , but fixed field will actually jump .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a simplified model for a heavy electron quantum phase transition , involving a transition from a metal plus decoupled spin liquid , to a heavy electron fluid in which the fermionic spin excitations develop charge .",
    "although our model is grossly over - simplified , it does illustrate how the development of charged heavy electrons out of the spin fluid is expected to affect the transport .      * the primary conclusion from our study is that the d.c .",
    "electrical conductivities ( both longitudinal and hall components ) are expected to jump discontinuously at a quantum critical point between a heavy fermion metal and a spin liquid .",
    "the key ingredient in this transition is the sudden appearance of resonant levels at each site in the lattice which scatter the conduction electrons .",
    "* our simple model assumed a separation between the spin and orbital parts of the magnetic field .",
    "real heavy electron systems exhibit strong spin orbit coupling , so that the idealized separation between the spin and orbital parts of the magnetic field can not in general , be made .",
    "nevertheless , the discontinuities we have found should be a general feature of any transition where the f - spin excitations suddenly develop a charge . *",
    "if we contrast our results with those anticipated in a spin density wave transformation of the fermi surface , we note that here the magnetic order will couple linearly to the conductivity and to the hall conductivity , so that gradual evolutions in the hall constant at the quantum phase transition are expected in the limit of weak magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "thus a jump in the hall conductivity is a sign that the order parameter is intimately connected with the formation of new , coherent propagating charged quasiparticles .",
