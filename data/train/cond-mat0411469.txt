    "the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in semiconductors has attracted great attention in recent years@xcite as it plays a very interesting role for the emerging field of semiconductor spintronics .",
    "so interaction can couple the spin degree of freedom of an electron to its orbital motion and vice versa thereby giving a useful handle for manipulating and controlling the electron spin by external electric fields or gate voltages .",
    "so is an intrinsic interaction having its origin from relativistic effects , but it is believed to be substantial in some semiconductors .",
    "more than ten years ago , datta and das theoretically analyzed the possibility of a spin - transistor which works due to rashba so interaction that induces spin precessions in a semiconductor@xcite with ferromagnetic leads .",
    "more recently , murakami _ et.al .",
    "_ theoretically predicted that a substantial amount of dissipationless quantum spin current could be generated by a co - action of electric field and so interaction@xcite .",
    "shen _ et.al . _ found a resonant spin hall conductance in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system with rashba so interaction under a perpendicular magnetic field@xcite .",
    "there are also many other works on related issues where so interaction plays a central role@xcite , and this research direction is expanding in a very rapid pace due to its possible application to spintronics .",
    "a semiconductor spintronic device is likely to be based on mesoscopic and nanostructures where electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions may be strong .",
    "hence it is desirable to formulate a general quantum transport theory which can handle so , e - e , and other interactions for systems in the metal - qd - metal configuration . here",
    "the `` qd '' indicates a quantum dot or the device scattering region where the various interactions exist , while the `` metals '' are device leads which extend to electron reservoirs far away .",
    "the metal leads may or may not be ferromagnetic , but are weakly coupled to the qd region . in almost all previous theoretical work ,",
    "the so interactions are represented by a real space hamiltonian where e - e interactions and strong correlations are usually neglected .",
    "indeed , it is rather difficult , if not impossible , to handle so together with e - e correlations and other interactions in real space for transport problems .",
    "in contrast , the most powerful and general theoretical technique for quantum transport in meso- and nano - scopic systems is the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism@xcite .",
    "negf can handle many - body correlations and interactions in an unified fashion and is a well established formalism@xcite .",
    "negf is typically formulated in momentum space or other spectral space for theoretical and numerical analysis .",
    "this means that all interactions need to be formulated in the spectral space . in other words , in order to conveniently apply negf theory , one needs to write the so interactions in a spectral space with second quantization . to the best of our knowledge , we are not aware of a derivation of such a second quantized form for so interaction .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to report a general quantum transport theory for metal - qd - metal devices with so and e - e interactions , based on the negf framework .",
    "we begin by presenting a pedagogical discussion of the general physics of so interaction by quantizing the corresponding _ classical _ action , which gives a vivid physical picture of so interaction .",
    "we then second quantize the real space so interaction hamiltonian in a proper spectral space so that it can be analyzed by negf for quantum transport properties of metal - qd - metal devices .",
    "although the derivations are general , we specialize on a metal - qd - metal device where the qd is described by the anderson model plus the rashba so interaction , and the leads are ferromagnetic metal .",
    "the second quantized hamiltonian can then be analyzed within negf and well established many - body theoretical methods@xcite . to illustrate our formalism",
    ", we investigate quantum transport properties of a aharnov - bohm ring where a qd having rashba so and e - e interactions sits in one arm of the ring .",
    "we found that a substantial spin - polarized conductance or current emerges in this device when a magnetic flux passes through the ring . in particular , its spin - polarized direction and strength are controllable by both the magnetic flux and a gate voltage , hence the predictions are testable experimentally .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the many - body hamiltonian of a general metal - qd - metal device structure , and present a pedagogical discussion of the so interactions in real space .",
    "we then proceed , in section iii , to second quantize the rashba so interaction in spectral space",
    "so that the entire device hamiltonian can be second quantized .",
    "this process is divided into several subsections and careful derivations and discussions will be presented .",
    "a brief summary for the second quantized hamiltonian in spectral space is given in section ii - f . in section iv , we analyze quantum transport properties of a modified ab ring which contains a qd in one arm of the ring , and both rashba so and e - e interactions exist in the qd .",
    "finally , section v summarizes the results of our work .",
    "in this section we discuss the hamiltonian of a general device structure in the metal - qd - metal device configuration . by presenting a very useful pedagogical discussion on the classical forces acting on moving charges and spins inside electrical and magnetic fields",
    ", we realize that the so interaction originates from the force ( torque ) of electrical field on the moving spin .",
    "this allows us to write down the hamiltonian for the so interaction in real space , @xmath0 , and in particular we derive the rashba so interaction .",
    "of course , the derived @xmath0 is the same as that from the dirac equation@xcite , but the pedagogical discussion gives a vivid physical picture about so interactions for quantum transport in solid state devices .",
    "in fact , in the literature of relativistic quantum mechanics such as the book of bjorken and drell@xcite , so interaction has been discussed with the point of view of quantizing the classical force acting on the moving spin by the external electric field .",
    "we found such a pedagogical discussion in the context of solid state electronics to be very useful .",
    "the general device structure we consider is schematically shown in fig.1a , where the scattering region ( qd ) is connected to the outside world by coupling to two ferromagnetic metal leads ( fm ) .",
    "the permanent magnetic moments of the leads are denoted by vectors @xmath1 where @xmath2 indicate the left and right leads .",
    "the qd is assumed to be weakly coupled to the leads due to the potential barriers at the two metal - qd junctions ( fig.1b ) . inside the qd there are so and e - e interactions , while these interactions are neglected in the leads .",
    "there may also be an external magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "for this device , the total many - body hamiltonian can be written as @xmath4 where the second term is the e - e interaction @xmath5 and the first term is from the single particle hamiltonian @xmath6 : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 contains the usual single particle terms : the kinetic and potential energies , the interaction energy with the magnetic moment @xmath10 in the ferromagnetic leads , and the zeeman energy .",
    "the last term in eq([hs1 ] ) is the so interaction @xmath11 . although the real space form of @xmath11 is known@xcite from dirac equation , in the following we present a pedagogical discussion about it .",
    "transport in our device is about the motion of two entities  charge and spin , in two fields  electric and magnetic fields .",
    "therefore there are a total of four actions due to the fields on the charge / spin : ( i ) the electric or coulomb force on charge ; ( ii ) the lorentz force on moving charge ; ( iii ) the magnetic force on spin ( zeeman ) ; and ( iv ) the electric force on moving spin . of these four actions , ( i)-(iii )",
    "are well known and familiar , but ( iv ) is much less so .",
    "where does ( iv ) comes from ?",
    "it comes due a purely relativistic effect@xcite .",
    "consider a spin which produces a magnetic field in the space surrounding it : if this spin is moving , by relativistic transform we obtain an electric field ( in addition to the magnetic field ) .",
    "in other words , a moving spin produces an electric field .",
    "conversely , if a spin is moving inside an _ external _ electric field , it will be subjected to an action ( torque ) . in this sense , ( iv ) is the counter part of the lorentz force .",
    "it has been shown that a moving spin with velocity * v * inside an electric field * e * is subjected to a torque action with an interactive potential energy:@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron mass , @xmath14 the speed of light , and the electron spin is @xmath15 .",
    "of course , this is a classical expression .    to quantize the classical torque energy ( [ torque1 ] )",
    ", we make the following replacements : electric field @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the potential energy of the system ; the speed @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the momentum operator .",
    "the quantum mechanical correspondence of expression ( [ torque1 ] ) becomes : @xmath20 \\nonumber\\\\   & = &   \\frac{\\hbar}{8m_e^2 c^2 }     \\left [ \\hat{\\bf \\sigma } \\bullet ( { \\bf p } \\times \\nabla v({\\bf r } ) )         +   \\nabla v({\\bf r } ) \\bullet ( \\hat{\\bf \\sigma}\\times { \\bf p } )     \\right ] \\label{hso1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the vector of pauli matrix .",
    "expression ( [ hso1 ] ) is exactly the general form of the so interaction hamiltonian , usually derived from the dirac equation in the low speed limits@xcite .",
    "therefore , the essence of the so interaction is simply the action of an external electric field on a moving spin .    if the potential @xmath17 has spherical symmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 , we have @xmath23",
    ". then the general spin - orbit interaction of eq.([hso1 ] ) reduces to the following familiar form : @xmath24 where the orbital angular momentum operator is @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , eq.([hso2 ] ) is the well - known thomas so coupling .",
    "when our device is made of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in which electrons are strongly confined in the @xmath26 direction by a confining potential @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 , then @xmath29 and the electric field is almost along the @xmath26 direction .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath27 is asymmetric with respect to the reflection point @xmath30 , then the matrix element @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the basic bound states in the @xmath26 direction . under these conditions ,",
    "the general so interaction eq.([hso1 ] ) reduces to the rashba so interaction form:@xcite @xmath33 \\label{rashba1}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the interaction coefficient .",
    "note that an asymmetrical confining potential in the direction perpendicular to the 2deg ( the @xmath35 direction ) is necessary , otherwise @xmath36 and there will be no rashba so interaction .",
    "it is worth to mention that the rashba so interaction strength @xmath37 can be tuned in an experiment by an external electric field or gate voltage , which have already been done in some recent experiments@xcite . finally ,",
    "if we consider other forms of the potential energy @xmath17 , we obtain other kinds of so interactions , but the essence of so coupling is the interaction of the external electric field on the moving spins .",
    "in this section we second quantize the device hamiltonian ( [ hdevice ] ) .",
    "the focus is to derive the second quantization of the rashba so interaction in a spectral form .      the second quantized form for the hamiltonian ( [ hdevice ] ) of the metal - qd - metal device with non - magnetic leads ( @xmath38 ) , in zero magnetic field ( @xmath39 ) , and without so interaction ( @xmath40 ) can be approximately written in the standard anderson model : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hamiltonian for the qd region ; @xmath43 is for the leads and @xmath44 the coupling between the leads and the qd : @xmath45 \\label{ht1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ( or + and - ) is the spin index which also describes the spin states , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the spin - up and spin - down states , respectively .",
    "@xmath50 is quantum number for eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath9 ( eq.([hs1 ] ) ) in the isolated qd region with eigen - energy @xmath51 ; @xmath52 is the quantum index for lead @xmath53 with eigen - energy @xmath54 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath55 describes coupling strength between the leads and the qd region .",
    "quantity @xmath56 is the matrix element for the two - body e - e interaction . here",
    "the e - e interaction in the leads region has been neglected .",
    "note that when @xmath57 , @xmath9 does not depend on the pauli matrix @xmath58 , therefore @xmath59 = 0 $ ] and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 are all independent of the spin - index @xmath63 .    for ferromagnetic leads",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath9 of eq.([hs1 ] ) contains a term @xmath65 .",
    "let s assume @xmath66 has a constant value in each lead @xmath53 although @xmath67 in general . by calculating matrix elements @xmath68 , the second quantization for this term can be easily obtained .",
    "@xmath69 becomes : @xmath70 due to the existence of @xmath71 , the state @xmath72 is usually not an eigenstate of isolated lead @xmath53 , and @xmath73 is not equal to the fermi distribution function @xmath74 even in equilibrium . in order to conveniently solve the transport problem , we diagonalize @xmath69 above by a rotational unitary transformation",
    "this is accomplished by setting : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the directional angles of the fm moment @xmath66 . under this rotational transformation ,",
    "the total second quantized hamiltonian of the metal - qd - metal device becomes : @xmath78 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "this form of the hamiltonian has been used before@xcite , but two important comments need to be made : ( i ) in hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) , the states @xmath80 are eigenstates of @xmath69 for isolated leads , hence in equilibrium @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "( ii ) after the rotational transformation , the spin - up direction in the left fm lead , the qd and the right fm lead , are all different although they are all aligned in their local @xmath83-direction .",
    "these local coordinate systems are shown in fig.2 . in the qd ,",
    "the spin - up direction is still in the original @xmath83 axis ; but in the left / right fm leads , the spin - up direction ( _ i.e. _ local @xmath83-direction ) is aligned with the fm moment @xmath84 ( see fig.2 ) . although this difference of spin - up alignment is not important when the qd bridging the leads has only a single connection ( such as fig.1 ) , it is important if the qd region has double or more connections ( such as fig.5 ) .      in this and the next subsections , we second quantize the rashba so interaction which is a major content of this paper .",
    "the rashba so interaction ( [ rashba1 ] ) can be splited into two terms : @xmath85 \\nonumber \\\\   & = &   \\frac{1}{2\\hbar }   \\left [          \\alpha(x ) \\hat{\\sigma}_z",

    "the first term @xmath87 gives rise to a spin precession@xcite while the second term @xmath88 does not .",
    "in particular , @xmath87 includes a @xmath89-function factor at the metal - qd contacts ( @xmath90 , see fig.1 ) with @xmath40 and the qd region with @xmath91@xcite .",
    "for this reason it can not be second quantized by simply calculating the matrix element @xmath92 . to overcome this difficulty one has to choose a new basis set in the qd .",
    "this will be accomplished in this subsection and the @xmath88 term will be studied in the next subsection .    for clarity , the real space single particle hamiltonian considered in this subsection",
    "is : @xmath93 this is just eq.([hs1 ] ) but with only the @xmath87 part of the so interactions .",
    "we make an unitary transformation with the following unitary matrix : @xmath94 where @xmath95 . here",
    "@xmath96 is permitted to have a dependence on spatial coordinate @xmath97 inside the qd , and it is zero outside ( @xmath98 or @xmath99 , see fig.1 ) . under this unitary transformation ,",
    "the original basis functions in the qd region , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , are transformed to @xmath102 these new basis functions are used to second quantize ( [ hs1r1 ] ) .",
    "after the unitary transformation , @xmath103 of eq.([hs1r1 ] ) becomes : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 , but the directional angles of @xmath107 are changed to ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) with @xmath110 .",
    "the essence of the above unitary transformation are the following .",
    "( i ) it is equivalent to choosing a space - dependent spin coordinate as shown in fig.3a , in which the spin @xmath83 direction is fixed everywhere but the spin @xmath86 and @xmath111 directions are dependent on the space position @xmath112 . in different positions along the @xmath113 axis , the directions of the spin @xmath114 axis are rotated . in other words ,",
    "the unitary transform changes us to a rotating frame .",
    "it is well - known that for an electron moving along the @xmath113 direction , the rashba term @xmath87 gives rise to a spin precession@xcite .",
    "that is , the spin component in the x - y plane will rotate as the electron moves along the @xmath115 direction , therefore the electron spin is usually not invariant .",
    "however , in the rotating frame which follows the spin precession , the spin is invariant hence @xmath116=0 $ ] is satisfied in the qd region .",
    "( ii ) the rashba interaction @xmath87 can cause an energy split between spin - up and spin - down states for non - zero @xmath117 , as shown by the energy dispersion in the left panel of fig.3b@xcite .",
    "the above unitary transformation recovers the alignment of the two dispersion curves so that the right panel of fig.3b is obtained .",
    "therefore , after the unitary transformation , the new hamilton @xmath118 appears to be completely the same as the hamiltonian without the rashba interaction @xmath87 , except a rotation of the magnetic moment @xmath119 and a potential energy difference @xmath120 which is a simple constant if @xmath96 is independent of @xmath97 . using the same method as that of the last subsection , the second quantization of eq.([hs1p ] )",
    "is easily obtained : @xmath121 \\label{hresult1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is one of the main results of this paper . here the rashba interaction @xmath87 gives rise to an extra spin dependent phase factor @xmath122 in ( [ hresult1 ] ) : it is @xmath123 for @xmath124 , and is @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "note that the term with this phase factor satisfies the time - reversal invariance while @xmath127 , _ i.e. _ @xmath128=0 $ ] where @xmath129 is the time - reversal operator.@xcite this is an expected property because the rashba so interaction in real space ( eq.([rashba1 ] ) ) does satisfy time - reversal invariance ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we emphasize that the phase factor @xmath122 in eq.([hresult1 ] ) is fundamentally different from the phase factor caused by magnetic flux in systems such as the ab - ring : the latter is independent of spin @xmath63 and it destroys time - reversal symmetry .",
    "for the special case where @xmath130=@xmath131=constant , _ i.e. _ independent of coordinate @xmath97 of the scattering region , we have @xmath132 .",

    "eq.([hr2-result ] ) is another main result of this paper .",
    "some general characteristics of eq.([hr2-result ] ) are in order .",
    "( i ) the property @xmath139 for the matrix elements originate from the time - reversal invariance of the original real space rashba hamiltonian.@xcite using this property , we can exactly prove that the second quantized form of @xmath88 , eq.([hr2-result ] ) , indeed satisfies the time - reversal invariance.@xcite ( ii ) if @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 hence @xmath142 must vanish .",
    "this means that the rashba so interaction can not induce any intra - level spin flip , _",
    "i.e. _ it can not give rise to a transition @xmath143 in which the level index @xmath50 is the same .",
    "therefore , the so interaction ( [ hr2-result ] ) is fundamentally different from that of an external magnetic field : magnetic field can cause intra - level spin - flip , provide a zeeman energy that relieves spin - degeneracy , and induce spin - polarization in an isolated qd ( see subsection ii - e below ) .",
    "( iii ) the rashba so interaction ( [ hr2-result ] ) can cause spin flips between different energy levels .",
    "this inter - level spin - flip coupling is similar to the intersubband mixing in real space which has been studied in previous works@xcite . despite of the inter - level spin",
    "flips , the system is still at least two - fold degenerate for any eigenstates because @xmath139 .",
    "this guarantees that at equilibrium an isolated qd has no spin polarization . in the appendix , the general properties of eq.([hr2-result ] )",
    "are further discussed .",
    "( iv ) in fact , because all spin - orbit couplings satisfy time - reversal invariance , the above properties and matrix elements @xmath144 must hold true in general . in this regard , we note that there existed papers where @xmath145 and intra - level spin - flips are allowed : these effects can not come from so interactions as some times claimed .",
    "let s estimate the value of @xmath146 .",
    "consider a square qd with linear size @xmath147 .",
    "the eigenstates are @xmath148 , hence @xmath149 can be easily calculated from eqs.([hr2a ] ) . for parameters",
    "@xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the intradot level spacing @xmath153 .",
    "this is to be compared with a rough estimate of @xmath154 .      in order to second",
    "quantize the rashba so interaction , we have introduced an unitary transformation defined by eqs.([u1 ] ) .",
    "does this transformation affect the familiar second quantized form of the e - e interaction ? here",
    "we show it does not .",
    "starting from the two - body e - e interaction in real space : @xmath155 we apply the unitary transformation and the new hamiltonian @xmath156 is : @xmath157 this means @xmath158 and the unitary transformation does not affect the form of the e - e interaction .",

    "we emphasize that this is an essential difference because of two reasons : ( i ) the magnetic field term destroys time - reversal invariance , it provides a zeeman energy that breaks the spin degeneracy of the energy levels , and it can induce a spin - polarization in equilibrium . in contrary , the rashba term @xmath88 satisfies time - reversal invariance and maintains the two degeneracies .",
    "( ii ) when @xmath140 , @xmath181 can be non - zero so that intra - level spin flips are possible .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath181 term is usually the largest term in the sum of eq.([bx2 ] ) , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath182 at @xmath183 . but for rashba interaction ( [ hr2-result ] ) , @xmath142 must vanish as discussed before so that it can not cause intra - level spin flip .",
    "we therefore comment that interactions of the following form , which has been used in some previous literature , @xmath184 does not represent so interaction .",
    "rather , it describes a magnetic field pointing to the x - direction .    in order to estimate the value of @xmath185",

    "the curves are dominated by two coulomb peaks at @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "when there is no rashba so interaction ( _ i.e. _ @xmath252 , solid curve ) , these two peaks show a typical fano resonance shape due to the interference of electrons passing the two arms of the ab ring , in agreement with previous theoretical and experimental studies@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to discover that this fano resonance can be strongly affected by the rashba so interaction . increasing the rashba parameter @xmath196 from @xmath253 ,",
    "the fano resonance is decreased and it can completely disappear at @xmath254 ( dotted curve ) . further increasing @xmath196 ,",
    "the fano resonance rises up again but with an oppositive fano factor , for example at @xmath255 ( dash - dot - dotted curve ) .    in order to understand these results",

    "@xmath257 is the phase difference of the transmission amplitude through the two arms , and it varies from @xmath253 to @xmath247 and finally to @xmath249 as @xmath243 is moved from @xmath258 to @xmath253 and finally to @xmath259 .",
    "this clearly shows that the total transmission probability is indeed having a fano asymmetric resonance shape when @xmath245 or @xmath249 . on the other hand , it is symmetric at @xmath260 or @xmath261 .",
    "hence the rashba so interaction can alter the fano resonance shape in substantial ways .",
    "next , in the three panels of fig.7 and fig.8 , we plot conductance @xmath262 and spin polarization @xmath263 versus magnetic flux @xmath204 for three values of @xmath264 , respectively .",
    "these values of @xmath243 are near the right coulomb peak of fig.6 . in fig.7 ,",
    "the thick curves are for @xmath265 and thin curves for @xmath266 , the solid , dashed , and dotted curves correspond different values of the rashba parameter @xmath252 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 .",
    "figs.7,8 clearly show that if either one of the two parameters ( @xmath204 and @xmath196 ) vanishes , the transport current has no spin polarization so that @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "however , when both parameters are nonzero , a substantial spin - polarized conductance is found and @xmath269 can be as large as @xmath270 for the given set of system parameters ( figs.8a , c ) .",
    "importantly , in the present device the direction of spin - polarization and its strength ( @xmath269 ) are easily controllable by varying system parameters which are experimentally accessible .",
    "( i ) by varying the magnetic flux @xmath204 : when @xmath204 is tuned from @xmath271 to @xmath247 ( or from @xmath247 to @xmath261 ) , the polarization @xmath269 strongly varies from a large positive value to a negative value or vice versa .",
    "( ii ) by varying the intradot level @xmath243 using a gate voltage : when @xmath243 is moved from one side to another side of a coulomb peak , the polarization @xmath269 can be tuned from its largest positive value to its largest negative value or vice versa .",
    "numerically we found that one only needs to change @xmath243 by a small amount to see the polarization change , namely a few half - widths @xmath272 of the coulomb peak ( parameters used in figs.7,8 correspond to @xmath273 ) .",
    "this means that in an experiment one only needs to slightly vary the gate voltage to change @xmath269 from @xmath274 to @xmath275 or vice versa .",
    "furthermore , we note that when polarization @xmath269 reaches its largest value , the conductance itself is still large , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath265 or @xmath266 can exceed over @xmath276 ( see fig.7a ) .",
    "finally , we estimate if the parameter @xmath196 can reach a value of @xmath247 in the present experimental technology so that the above theoretical predictions can be observed experimentally . assuming the rashba so interaction strength @xmath277 , which is the reported value for some semiconductors@xcite , @xmath278 for @xmath279 .",
    "then , if the length of the qd is the typical value @xmath280 , @xmath281 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath196 can reach a value @xmath282 or larger experimentally .",
    "in this paper we have derived a second quantized hamiltonian in _ spectral space _ for a general device structure of metal - qd - metal configuration , including the spin - orbital and e - e interactions . in other words , we extended the standard anderson hamiltonian to the case where the central device region has a ( rashba ) spin - orbital interaction .",
    "we discovered that the rashba so interaction causes two changes : ( i ) it gives rise to an extra spin dependent phase factor @xmath203 in the coupling matrix elements between the leads and the quantum dot .",
    "( ii ) the rashba so interaction causes an inter - level spin - flip term with strength @xmath283 , and it can not cause any intra - level spin flips .",
    "the spectral form of the hamiltonian is very important as it allows the analysis of many complicated quantum transport problems involving so and e - e interactions , by using the well established many - body green s function theoretical techniques such as the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function formalism . on the other hand",
    ", it would be much more difficult to carry out similar investigations using a real space hamiltonian , especially if e - e interactions are present .",
    "as an example , we investigated quantum transport properties of a ab ring in which a qd having rashba so and e - e interactions is embedded in one arm of the ring . a substantial spin - polarized current or conductance emerges in this device due to a combined effect of a magnetic flux and the rashba so interaction .",

    "we start from the hamiltonian @xmath287 of eqs.([hs1 ] ) but setting @xmath288 in ( [ hs1 ] ) , assume @xmath289 is an eigen - state of @xmath287 so that @xmath290 .",
