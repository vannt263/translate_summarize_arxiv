    "semilattices are ordered structures that admit an algebraic presentation .",
    "formally , a semilattice may be presented as a partially ordered set @xmath0 such that for every pair @xmath1 there exists the supremum or _ join _",
    "@xmath2 of the set @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath4 is a semilattice if @xmath5 is an idempotent commutative semigroup operation . in this case",
    "we call @xmath6 a _ @xmath5-semilattice _",
    "( `` join - semilattice '' ) .",
    "we can also define a partial _ meet _ operation @xmath7 in a @xmath5-semilattice that equals the infimum of @xmath3 whenever it exists .",
    "the paradigmatic example of a semilattice is given by any family of sets that is closed under ( finite ) union .",
    "actually , the free semilattice on @xmath8 generators is given by the powerset of @xmath9 minus @xmath10 .",
    "a reference for concepts of general algebra and ideals in semilattices is @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to obtain an inner characterization of direct product decompositions of semilattices akin to those in classical algebra . to attain this goal we represent these decompositions by means of factor congruences .",
    "a _ factor congruence _ is the kernel @xmath11 of a projection @xmath12 onto a direct factor of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , a direct product representation @xmath13 is determined by the pair of _ complementary _ factor congruences given by the canonical projections @xmath14 .",
    "we prove that factor congruences and direct representations can be described by generalized notions of order ideal and of direct sum of ideals . when the semilattice has a minimum ( maximum ) element , these generalized ideals turn into ordinary ( dual ) ideals .",
    "the main feature of this characterization is that it is completely analogous to similar definitions in the realm of classical algebra , as in ring theory . by using the partial @xmath15 operation",
    "we devise a definition with the same ( quantifier ) complexity as the reader may encounter in classical algebra , and we obtain an equational relation between each element and its direct summands in a given decomposition .    by the end of the paper",
    "we apply the characterization to the bounded case and show that each of the axioms is necessary .",
    "the key idea in our characterization stems from the fact that in a direct product of join - semilattices there must exist `` non - trivial '' meets satisfying certain modularity and absorption laws with respect to join . and",
    "conversely , the existence of meets in a direct product implies the existence of them in each factor .",
    "we state without proof the latter property :    [ claim : meet_prod ] for every @xmath16-semilattices @xmath17 and elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 , if @xmath20 exists in @xmath21 , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 exist ( and conversely ) .    as an a example , a semilattice @xmath6 is pictured in figure  [ fig : paraguas ] .",
    "@xmath6 is isomorphic to the direct product of its subsemilattices @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "according to this representation , the pair @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath27 . in spite of @xmath27",
    "not being expressible in terms of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath5 , we can recover @xmath27 as the infimum @xmath30 .",
    "other relations between @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath31 ( the only element in @xmath32 ) may be found ; next we choose four of them that hold exactly when @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath26 in a direct decomposition .",
    "isomorphic to @xmath33 . ]    in the following , we will write formulas in the extended language @xmath34 . the formula `` @xmath35 '' will be interpreted as `` the infimum of @xmath36 exists and equals @xmath37 '' : @xmath38 unless explicitly indicated ; in general , every equation @xmath39 involving @xmath15 will be read as `` if either side exists , the other one also does and they are equal '' .",
    "it is easy to see that the associative law holds for the partial @xmath15 operation in every @xmath5-semilattice , and we will apply it without any further mention .    heretofore , @xmath6 will be a @xmath16-semilattice and @xmath40 arbitrary but fixed .",
