    ", we refer to the absence of strong repulsive forces at short distances . in this letter",
    ", we address a central question in nuclear structure theory : how large a nucleus can be calculated from first principles using the framework of chiral nuclear eft , and what are the remaining challenges ?",
    "we address this question by using nuclear lattice effective field theory ( nleft ) to calculate the ground states of alpha nuclei from @xmath0he to @xmath1si .",
    "nleft is an _ ab initio _ method where chiral nuclear eft is combined with auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) lattice calculations .",
    "nleft differs from other _ ab initio _ methods in that it is an unconstrained monte carlo calculation , which does not require truncated basis expansions , many - body perturbation theory , or any constraint on the nuclear wave function .",
    "our nleft results are thus truly unbiased monte carlo calculations .",
    "the results presented here form an important benchmark for _ ab initio _ calculations of larger nuclei using chiral nuclear eft .",
    "any deficiencies are indicative of shortcomings in the specific nuclear interactions , rather than of errors generated by the computational method",
    ". such a definitive analysis would be difficult to achieve using other methods .",
    "the lattice formulation of chiral nuclear eft is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , a review of lattice eft methods can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and refs .",
    "@xcite provide a comprehensive overview of chiral nuclear eft .",
    "we have recently applied nleft to describe the structure of the hoyle state  @xcite and the dependence of the triple - alpha process on the fundamental parameters of nature  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that nleft is successful up to @xmath2 nucleons . in this letter , we report the first nleft results for medium - mass nuclei .",
    "we compute the ground state energies for all nuclei in the alpha ladder up to @xmath1si using the lattice action established in refs .  @xcite .",
    "according to chiral nuclear eft , our calculations are organized in powers of a generic soft scale @xmath3 associated with factors of momenta and the pion mass .",
    "we label the @xmath4 contributions to the nuclear hamiltonian as leading order ( lo ) , @xmath5 as next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and @xmath6 as next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "the present calculations are performed up to nnlo .",
    "our lo lattice hamiltonian includes a significant part of the nlo and higher - order corrections by making use of smeared contact interactions  @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the interactions used in this work . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we are using a low - momentum power counting scheme where there are no additional two - nucleon corrections at nnlo beyond the terms already appearing at nlo .",
    "the nleft calculations reported here are performed with a lattice spacing of @xmath7  fm in a periodic cube of length @xmath8  fm .",
    "our trial wave function is denoted @xmath9 , which is a slater - determinant state composed of delocalized standing waves in the periodic cube , with @xmath10 nucleons and the desired spin and isospin quantum numbers . for simplicity",
    ", we describe our calculations using the language of continuous time evolution .",
    "the actual afqmc calculations use transfer matrices with a temporal lattice spacing of @xmath11  fm  @xcite .",
    "before we enter into the main part of the calculation , we make use of a low - energy filter based upon wigner s su(4 ) symmetry , where the spin - isospin degrees of freedom of the nucleon are all equivalent as four components of an su(4 ) multiplet .",
    "let us define @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a gaussian smearing function with width set by the average effective range of the two @xmath14-wave interaction channels , and @xmath15 is the total nucleon density .",
    "we then apply the exponential of @xmath16 to obtain @xmath17 which we refer to as a `` trial state '' .",
    "this part of the calculation is computationally inexpensive since it only requires a single auxiliary field and does not generate any sign oscillations in the monte carlo calculation .",
    "next , we use the lo hamiltonian @xmath18 to construct the euclidean - time projection amplitude @xmath19 from which we compute the `` transient energy '' @xmath20/\\partial t. \\label{eat}\\ ] ] if the lowest eigenstate of @xmath18 that possesses a non - vanishing overlap with the trial state @xmath21 is denoted @xmath22 , the energy @xmath23 of @xmath22 is obtained as the @xmath24 limit of @xmath25 .    the higher - order corrections to @xmath23",
    "are evaluated using perturbation theory .",
    "we compute expectation values using @xmath26 for any operator @xmath27 . given the ratio @xmath28 the expectation value of @xmath27 for the desired state @xmath22 is again obtained in the @xmath29 limit according to @xmath30 which gives the corrections to @xmath23 induced by the nlo and nnlo contributions .",
    "the closer @xmath21 is to @xmath22 , the less the required projection time @xmath31",
    ". the trial state can be optimized by adjusting both the su(4 ) projection time @xmath32 and the strength of the coupling @xmath33 of @xmath16 . here , we show that the accuracy of the extrapolation @xmath34 can be further improved by simultaneously incorporating data from multiple trial states that differ in the choice of @xmath33 .",
    "this approach enables a `` triangulation '' of the asymptotic behavior as the common limit of several different functions of @xmath31 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath35 and @xmath36 at large @xmath31 is controlled by the low - energy spectrum of @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath37 label the eigenstates of @xmath18 with energy @xmath38 , and let @xmath39 denote the density of states for a system of @xmath10  nucleons . for simplicity ,",
    "we omit additional labels needed to distinguish degenerate states .",
    "we can then express @xmath35 and @xmath36 in terms of their spectral representations , @xmath40 from which the spectral representations of @xmath25 and @xmath41 are obtained using eq .",
    "( [ eat ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ xat ] ) , respectively .",
    "we can approximate these to arbitrary accuracy over any finite range of @xmath31 by taking @xmath39 to be a sum of energy delta functions , @xmath42 where we use @xmath43 for the calculation of the @xmath44he ground state , and @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "these choices give a good description over the full range of @xmath31 for all trial states , without introducing too many free parameters .",
    "using afqmc data for different values of @xmath33 , we perform a correlated fit of @xmath25 and @xmath41 for all operators @xmath27 that contribute to the nlo and nnlo corrections .",
    "we find that using 2 - 6 distinct trial states for each @xmath10 allows for a much more precise determination of @xmath23 and @xmath47 than hitherto possible .",
    "in particular , we may `` triangulate ''",
    "@xmath47 using trial states that correspond to functions @xmath41 which converge both from above and below . as the extent of our mc data in euclidean time is relatively short , we discuss next the level of confidence that we can attribute to our results . in our `` triangulation '' method , the accuracy and reliability of the extrapolation @xmath48 is increased by means of correlated fits to multiple trial states .",
    "we first note that the number of euclidean time steps @xmath49 available for the extrapolation does not decrease drastically with the number of nucleons @xmath10 .",
    "this inspires confidence that our method , which has by now been successfully applied to the structure , spectrum and electromagnetic properties of @xmath50o in ref .",
    "@xcite should also be applicable to heavier systems .",
    "nevertheless , `` spurious early convergence '' in euclidean time extrapolations should be carefully guarded against .",
    "if only one trial state is used , this issue arises much more readily . in our `` triangulation '' method ,",
    "the extrapolation is very strongly constrained by the requirement that all observables for all trial states should be described by the same exponential dependence on euclidean time .",
    "rapid convergence in @xmath31 then translates into a small sensitivity to @xmath33 at large values of @xmath31 .",

    "as we ascend the alpha ladder from @xmath0he to @xmath1si , the lighter nuclei can be described as collections of alpha clusters  @xcite .",
    "as the number of clusters increases , they become increasingly densely packed , such that a more uniform liquid of nucleons is approached .",
    "this increase in the density of alpha clusters appears correlated with the gradual overbinding we observe at nnlo for @xmath72 .",
    "as this effect becomes noticeable for @xmath50o , we can view it as a problem which first arises in a system of four alpha clusters .",
    "the alpha - cluster structure of @xmath50o will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , which removed discretization errors associated with four nucleons occupying the same lattice site , we can attempt to remove similar errors associated with four alpha clusters in close proximity on neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the simplest interaction which permits a removal of the overbinding associated with such configurations is @xmath73 with @xmath74 the total nucleon density .",
    "the summation includes nearest or next - to - nearest neighbor ( spatial ) lattice sites .    in table",
    "[ tab_en ] , the column labeled `` + 4n@xmath71 '' shows the results at nnlo while including both the 3nf and @xmath75 . due to the low momentum cutoff",
    ", the two - pion exchange contributions have been absorbed into the contact interactions at nlo .",
    "we have tuned @xmath76 to give approximately the correct energy for the ground state of @xmath57 mg . with @xmath75 included , a good description of the ground - state energies is obtained over the full range from light to medium - mass nuclei , with a maximum error no larger than @xmath77% .",
    "this lends support to the qualitative picture that the overbinding of the nnlo results in table  [ tab_en ] is associated with the increased packing of alpha clusters and the eventual crossover to a uniform nucleon liquid .",
    "the missing physics would then be comprised of short - range repulsive forces that counteract the dense packing of alpha clusters .    in spite of the good agreement with experiment in table  [ tab_en ] upon introduction of @xmath75",
    ", we also need to consider whether this could be merely an accidental effect .",
    "it is then helpful to check whether a consistent picture is obtained with respect to excited states , transitions and electromagnetic properties of the nuclei in the medium - mass range where @xmath75 gives a sizable contribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find very convincing evidence supporting our results and analysis from the properties of @xmath50o , including its first excited @xmath78 state .",
    "in particular , the excitation energies and level ordering in @xmath50o was found to be very sensitive to the strength and form of @xmath75 .",
    "such a sensitivity arises due to the differences in the alpha - cluster structure of the states in question .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath75 can be expressed as @xmath79 , where we use @xmath80  mev and @xmath81  mev as in ref .  @xcite . while the magnitude of @xmath76 appears to be somewhat large compared to",
    "what is expected based on naive dimensional analysis , the effective 4n contribution to _",
    "e.g. _ the alpha particle binding energy is negligibly small , in agreement with the chiral power counting .",
    "thus , the increasing effective 4n contributions that we find for @xmath82 are the result of large operator expectation values for the nuclear wave function .",
    "we expect that this effect is due to the coarse lattice spacing , and can be ameliorated by using a smaller lattice spacing and an interaction with more short - range repulsion .",
    "let us now return to the question we posed at the beginning : how large a nucleus can be calculated from first principles using chiral nuclear eft , and what are the remaining challenges ? using a soft nucleon - nucleon interaction with a momentum cutoff scale of @xmath83  mev , we found that the two - nucleon potential is accurate for lighter nuclei but overbinds those beyond @xmath50o . as a result ,",
    "the overall contribution of multi - nucleon forces must compensate by changing sign from attractive to repulsive with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "while such an effect can not be accommodated by the 3nf at nnlo alone , the overall contribution from higher - order interactions should be similar to our effective four - nucleon interaction , which counteracts the packing of alpha clusters .",
    "still , this implies a large correction from higher - order terms .",
    "analogous problems will arise in computational methods that use renormalization group flows to soften the two - nucleon interaction . in that case , the large repulsive corrections appear in the form of strong induced multi - nucleon forces .    from our analysis",
    ", the path forward for _ ab initio _ calculations of heavier nuclei using chiral nuclear eft appears clear .",
    "the softening of the two - nucleon interaction should not be pushed so far that heavier nuclei become significantly overbound by the two - nucleon force alone .",
    "this is not merely an issue for nleft , but would appear to be a universal criterion for all _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "a concerted effort should be made to improve the current computational algorithms to handle interactions with more short - range repulsion .",
    "the nleft collaboration is now exploring this approach for studies of larger nuclei .",
