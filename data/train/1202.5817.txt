    "quantum entanglement , originated from nonlocal quantum correlation , is fundamental in quantum physics both for understanding the nonlocality of quantum mechanics  @xcite and plays an important role in almost all efficient protocols for quantum computations and communications  @xcite . due to the unavoidable interaction with the environment , an initially entangled two - qubit system becomes totally disentangled after evolving for a finite time .",
    "this phenomena is called entanglement sudden death ( esd )  @xcite and has been recently demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement may fail to capture the existence of the quantum correlation in some mixed separate states , in which the entanglement is considered not a good measure  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new kind of the quantum correlation , quantum discord ( qd ) has attracted a lot of attentions  @xcite .",
    "it provides the alternative route for measurement , which is present even under separable states  @xcite .",
    "the definition of the qd can be interpreted as the difference of the total quantum information of the two sub - systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 before and after the local operation on the one of them .",
    "the qd has been proved as a good measure of the non - classical correlations beyond entanglement .",
    "furthermore , the qd has been indicated as the source to speed up the quantum computations  @xcite .",
    "some works have been devoted to the qd dynamics of two qubits coupled to markovian  @xcite and non - markovian  @xcite environments .",
    "the comparisons with entanglement dynamics have been also performed .",
    "however , the relevant study on two two - level atoms ( qubits ) coupled to independent or common single - mode cavities without dissipations has not been found in the literature , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we believe that the qd dynamics in these qubit systems is also of fundamental interest .",
    "in addition , some essential pictures can be clearly described and unfolded in the framework of the simple model where the exact solutions are available .",
    "actually , the entanglement dynamics for two independent jaynes - cummings ( jc ) atoms has been well studied previously  @xcite .",
    "the esd was observed obviously from the initial bell states with correlated spins .",
    "this feature would prevent the application of the entanglement as basic resource for quantum information processing . what is the consequence for the qd in this kind of the qubit system ? .",

    "especially , for large detunnings @xmath78 , the qd remains almost unchanged . in this case",
    ", we find that the components of the bell stats show slightly variation with time for large detunning , due to the fact that large detunnings prevent the hopping for photons between different atomic levels to certain degree .",
