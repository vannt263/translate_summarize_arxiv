    "it is widely accepted that low energy gluons are responsible for the distinctive features of qcd such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . due to strong interactions , precision calculations of gluonic excitations",
    "are sparse and experimental evidence for gluonic excitations is still murky .",
    "this is because dynamical quarks and open channels need to be considered before comparing with experimental data . for the purpose of getting insights into the non - perturbative features of qcd",
    "it is however possible to design idealized systems that are sensitive to the pure yang - mills sector and to bypass many of the complications of the full qcd .",
    "a gluelump is an example of such an idealized state .",
    "it is a state of the gluon field bound to a static , localized octet source which can be constructed , for example as the quark - antiquark pair placed at an origin .",
    "since the quark and the antiquark are at zero relative separation the system is rotationally symmetric , invariant under parity and charge conjugation .",
    "thus gluelump states can be classified by the same @xmath0 quantum numbers as ordinary mesons .",
    "the spectrum of gluelumps have been obtained from lattice gauge simulations and shows an unusual ordering of the various @xmath0 levels  @xcite .",
    "the ground state has @xmath1 and the first excited state has @xmath2 . if the gluelump is to be interpreted as a state of a single ( effective , quasi ) gluon bound to a static source , then one would expect the @xmath3 state to be below @xmath4 , since the former corresponds to a single gluon in an @xmath5-wave orbital and the latter to a gluon in a @xmath6-wave orbital .",
    "the following two levels have @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively and similarly correspond to a reverse ordering of the @xmath6-wave orbital ( @xmath8 ) and the @xmath9-wave orbital ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is clear that a simple constituent model of the gluon bound to the @xmath11 with a central potential  @xcite will not reproduce the lattice spectrum , since the centrifugal barrier orders the spectrum according to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "another popular model for low lying gluonic excitations is based on the strong - coupling limit and considers gluons as excitations of the chromoelectric flux tube  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "the model has not been used to compute the gluelump spectrum but it does reproduce the ordering of the few lowest levels of the excited adiabatic potentials between the @xmath11 sources  @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic potentials give gluon energies for finite separation between the quark and the antiquark and reduce ( modulo a zero point energy ) to the gluelump spectrum in the limit of vanishing @xmath11 separation .",
    "the correct ordering of the adiabatic potential in the flux tube model is however somewhat artificial as it relies on a postulated intrinsic charge conjugation to be assigned to the flux tube .",
    "furthermore , while there is a clear evidence that at large separation between the @xmath11 sources the flux tube develops  @xcite and gluonic excitations are effectively those of the nambu - goto string  @xcite , on the contrary it is not clear if the flux tube picture is correct when the @xmath11 separation is taken to zero .",
    "in fact , the splitting of adiabatic potentials from lattice simulations for small @xmath11 separations may be more constituent - like rather than string - like  @xcite .",
    "the gluelump spectrum may therefore be used to discriminate between alternative pictures of the gluonic excitations far from the adiabatic limit .",
    "another reason for why it is important to pin down the characteristics of gluonic excitations for @xmath11 separation smaller than @xmath12 is because of their relevance to the dynamics of heavy hybrid quarkonia .",
    "these are physical states and there already might be experimental evidence for such states  @xcite . finally mixing between the @xmath11 and the hybrid component of a heavy quarkonium",
    "is responsible for relativistic corrections to the static @xmath11 potential which is relevant to normal quarkonium spectroscopy  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the gluelump spectrum in the variational approach based on the coulomb gauge qcd . a variational vacuum wave functional constrains single gluon properties and in particular leads to an effective gluon mass .",
    "this enables truncation of the gluon fock space and makes it possible to identify low lying gluelump states with the bound states of a single quasi - gluon . in section",
    "ii we present the details of the coulomb gauge description of the gluelump spectrum and give the numerical results .",
    "summary and outlook are summarized in section iii .",
    "the variational approach to coulomb gauge qcd  @xcite has recently been studied in  @xcite . here",
    "we will only briefly summarize the method and give the relevant equations for the study of gluelump spectrum .",
    "the coulomb gauge eliminates unphysical degrees of freedom , provided the domain of transverse field variables , @xmath13 , ( @xmath14 ) is restricted to the fundamental modular region ( fmr ) .",
    "the fundamental modular region is a subset of the gribov region  @xcite defined as the set of fields for which the determinant of the faddeev - poppov ( fp ) operator is positive and the fmr is a set of unique field representatives lying on a gauge orbit and satisfying the coulomb gauge condition .",
    "restriction to the fundamental modular region is hard to implement , however it was argued in  @xcite that the bulk contribution to the functional integrals over the field variables comes from the common boundary of the fmr and the gribov region , and restriction to the gribov region can be implemented within the variational approach . within this approach the vacuum wave functional",
    "is chosen to be of the form @xmath15 = { \\cal n }   \\exp\\left ( - { 1\\over 2 } \\int d\\x \\a^a(\\x ) \\omega(\\x - \\y ) \\a^a(\\y ) \\right ) , \\label{psi}\\ ] ] with the gap function @xmath16 determined by minimizing the expectation value of the coulomb gauge hamiltonian @xmath17 $ ] @xmath18 h\\left [ \\a , -i{{\\delta } \\over { \\delta \\a } } \\right ]   \\psi[\\a ]   = 0 \\label{gap}\\ ] ] here @xmath19\\right]$ ] is the determinant of the faddeev - popov operator ; @xmath20 is the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation .",
    "the coulomb gauge hamiltonian @xmath21 contains direct interaction between color charge densities , @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24^{-1 } ( -\\bm{\\nabla}^2 ) \\left [ \\bm{\\nabla } \\cdot { \\bf d } \\right]^{-1}\\right\\ } _ { \\x , a;\\y , b } \\label{kernel}\\ ] ] the inverse of the two covariant derivatives , when expanded in power series in the coupling constant , @xmath25 , produces an ( infinite ) series of interactions that couple an arbitrary number of transverse gluons to the quark and/or gluon sources via the bare coulomb potential @xmath26 .",
    "when these gluons are integrated over the vacuum wave functional of eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , they dress the bare coulomb potential and it results in an effective interaction which is approximately linear for large separations between the sources  @xcite . this effective coulomb potential is defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28|^2 .\\ ] ] the subscript @xmath29 means that @xmath30 is expected to have a short distance , coulomb - like component and a long - distance , linear part .",
    "the dyson series for the effective interaction , @xmath30 is divergent in the ultraviolet and the bare coupling is renormalized by fixing the slope of the potential to agree with the lattice data for the wilson loop .",
    "there is , however , a difference between the renormalization group equations for the coupling obtained in the variational approach and that of the qcd beta - function .",
    "this is to be expected since the variational approximation includes only two - body correlations ( just like bcs ) and , for example does not take into account propagation of transverse gluons  @xcite . furthermore , even for exact vacuum the expectation value of @xmath31 is not the same at the energy of the @xmath11 state  @xcite .",
    "this is because the state of a @xmath11 pair added to the vacuum is not the same as the true eigenstate of the qcd hamiltonian in presence of the @xmath11 pair .",
    "all this lead to an ambiguity in fixing the long range part of the @xmath11 potential .",
    "fortunately we expect that this will not play an important role for small , and in the case of gluelumps , vanishing @xmath11 separations , and in general for low energy gluonic excitations that have wave functions confined to a region of @xmath32 that are not too sensitive to the asymptotic , long range behavior of the confining potential .",
    "finally , ambiguities in the renormalization group equations of the variational methods , have so far prevented from obtaining a unique solution for @xmath16 by using the gap equation  @xcite .",
    "in particular it is expected that at low momentum , @xmath33 , ( the fourier transform of @xmath34 ) has momentum dependence identical to that of the expectation value of the curvature , @xmath35 defined through the determinant of the faddeev - popov operator , @xmath36 while at large momenta , @xmath37 .",
    "there are indications from lattice computations that @xmath33 is different from zero as @xmath38 but the lattice results can not resolve between @xmath39 finite and @xmath40  @xcite . in our analysis we will thus study how the gluelump spectrum depends on the gluon gap function @xmath16 .",

    "the possible quantum numbers of such states match with those found in lattice computations . furthermore , ordering of these levels is reproduced , and it turns out to be non - trivially related to the non - abelian structure of the coulomb interaction in the coulomb - gauge which leads to new ( three - body ) interaction in the schrdinger equation for the gluelump energies .",
