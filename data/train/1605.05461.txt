    "another eminent difference in the temperature - dependent dc - susceptibility of the low-@xmath20 samples is that the zero - field cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) data for the quenched sample are identical except at very low temperatures while there is a large difference in the case of the controlled - cooled sample below roughly @xmath32 .",

    "the main result is shown in fig .",
    "as before , controlled - cooled and quenched powder samples from both the low-@xmath20 and the large-@xmath20 sections in the phase diagram were analysed : the differences in the magnetic phases are reflected in differences in the xrd patterns . figures  [ fig3](a ) to ( d ) show xrd data for four selected samples on a magnified view of the cubic @xmath47 reflection around @xmath48 : ( a ) @xmath49 , @xmath50k , quenched ; ( b ) @xmath51 , @xmath52k , controlled cooled ; ( c ) @xmath53 , @xmath54k , quenched ; ( d ) @xmath55 , @xmath56k , controlled cooled .",

    "this is in agreement with the observation that for @xmath59 , there is no clear difference in the magnetic state any more between controlled - cooled and quenched samples .",
    "however , for controlled - cooled samples with smaller @xmath20 , i.e. , below the grey - shaded area in the phase diagram , the situation turns out to be much more complicated .",
    "as can be seen in panel ( b ) , the @xmath57 reflection has split into two broader peaks with lower intensity .",
    "we note that we also observe similar splittings of other reflections @xmath60 with non - zero @xmath61 value , indicating that this splitting is not due to an impurity phase . at the same time the @xmath58 peak also broadens . keeping in mind that the @xmath57 reflection provides information about the degree of the rhombohedral distortion",
    ", we interpret the apparent double - peak structure as an indication that controlled - cooled low-@xmath20 sample consists of domains with different degrees of rhombohedral distortion while obeying the same overall crystal symmetry . in the present case ,",
    "we assume domains with two main distortions and label the two peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) as ` @xmath62 ' and ` @xmath63 ' for simplicity .",
    "the former domain @xmath62 is strongly distorted , close to the situation in pristine gete while the latter exhibits a smaller distortion which implies that the @xmath63 component has a larger mn concentration , naturally supporting the aforementioned scenario of a slow - cooling triggered spatial inhomogeneity of the mn distribution .    in fig .",

    "the controlled - cooled sample exhibits a more inhomogeneous mn distribution than the quenched sample , see text.,width=453 ]    another important issue is whether the different magnetic phases with high-@xmath0  and low-@xmath0  values in the low-@xmath20 section of the magnetic phase diagram can be repeatedly switched back and forth . to demonstrate this feature , a sample from an initially controlled - cooled batch ( @xmath86 ) was chosen and six times ( from step 2 to step 7 ) switched as shown in fig .",

    "this finding indicates that both observed magnetic phases are reproducibly switchable into each other , fulfilling one of the essential requirements for phase - change - memory functionality .",
    "it should be noted that the slight variation in @xmath0  of the high-@xmath0  phase between the different phase switching steps 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is probably a consequence of slightly different degrees of mn inhomogeneity in the sample obtained after each thermal cycle , rather than due to a degradation in the bulk of the sample .",
    "mn@xmath8te : ( a ) summarizes dc magnetisation data for each of the seven phase - conversion steps ( controlled cooled ` cc ' vs.  quenched ` q ' ) .",
    "all data are taken on the same specimen upon field cooling in @xmath87  t. the mn concentration as estimated from the magnetisation value at 2  k and 7  t is @xmath86 .",
    "the dotted lines are fits to the data and show how the magnetic transition temperatures @xmath0  were determined .",
    "the numbers 1 to 7 indicate the chronological order of the heat treatment and hence measurements .",
    "the variation of @xmath0  and the magnetisation at 70  k as indicated by the vertical line in ( a ) among the different switching steps are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively.,width=377 ]",
    "the present data provide a consistent picture suggesting that the difference in the strength of ferromagnetic interaction originates from the degree of clustering or inhomogeneity of the substitutionally doped mn@xmath10 ions .",
    "on the one hand , high @xmath0  values are found when the mn - rich clusters or islands in a lake of mn - poor , almost pristine gete have the time to arrange themselves during the controlled - cooling process , i.e. , for @xmath20 around 0.05 leading to a highly inhomogeneous situation . within the mn - rich region ,",
    "the ferromagnetic interaction is stronger than expected for the averaged mn concentration within the rkky scheme . on the other hand , when the mn ions are not able to cluster , i.e. , when the system is quenched from the high - temperature homogeneous arrangement , the @xmath0  values turn out to be much smaller .",
    "apparently , the homogeneous situation is frozen and the magnetic interaction is weaker . upon further doping , the mn concentration becomes large enough to allow for cubic phase fractions to emerge .",
    "this leads to a suppression of @xmath0  when approaching the critical @xmath20 range around @xmath88 where the structural phase transition drops below room temperature .",
    "hence the high-@xmath0  and low-@xmath0  phase boundaries merge and the clustering is reduced .",
    "one might expect that at sufficiently large mn - doping concentrations , similarly large @xmath0  values must be achievable .",
    "in fact , the maximum @xmath0  was reported in the old literature to be around 160  k for @xmath89,@xcite somewhat smaller than @xmath90  k reported in this article .",
    "assuming that the slope of the phase boundary above @xmath23 holds and extrapolating the phase line towards larger @xmath20 values , a comparably large @xmath0  of 180  k is expected for @xmath91 in the cubic phase .",
    "however , even the local spatial fluctuation of the mn content for the low-@xmath20 and high-@xmath0  sample [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] seems not to reach such a high value as @xmath91 ( cubic )",
    ". this discrepancy may have the important implication that the possible accommodation of relatively high-@xmath20 ( @xmath92 ) mn content in the rhombohedrally distorted polar lattice structure ( e.g. , the @xmath63 phase in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) may host higher @xmath0  values than the comparably or even higher mn - doped cubic phase . the characteristic rashba - type spin - split valence band structure in the polar state , as recently proven theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite may play some role in giving rise to such a large difference in rkky interactions in the polar and cubic lattices .",
    "the appearance of mn inhomogeneity and different rhombohedral distortions in this system suggest that a spinodal decomposition occurs in the low - mn - concentration region when a sample is cooled down slowly : a uniform solid solution becomes unstable against composition modulations upon cooling.@xcite we note here that this process is totally different from the structural phase change between crystalline and amorphous .",
    "the highest temperature which the samples experience during the heat - treatment process is 900  k , which is well below the melting temperature of ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te .",
    "such a nanoscale phase separation is discussed in related compounds , and means that the spin subsystems undergo a segregation , i.e. , regions with an either high or low concentration of the magnetic dopant are formed .",
    "it is also known that the degree of inhomogeneity in diluted magnetic semiconductors can indeed influence the strength of the ferromagnetic interaction and strong inhomogeneity may significantly increase @xmath0.@xcite moreover it was reported that the ferromagnetic transition temperature can vary depending on the heat - treatment , as , e.g. , in the text - book diluted magnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as,@xcite but the mechanism is different from the spinodal decomposition proposed here for . in the case of ( ga , mn)as , the annealing largely affects the amount of interstitial mn ions , resulting in the difference of @xmath0 . in the present case ,",
    "however , the almost identical properties in the high-@xmath20 region among the samples treated in either thermal process indicate that interstitial mn ions , if any , play a rather minor role in governing the magnetic properties ( although the effect of interstitial mn ions should be investigated in detail in the future ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic phase change functionality reported here was never identified before .",
    "it was theoretically found that nanoscale spinodal decomposition in diluted magnetic semiconductors can lead to large values of @xmath0  in cases where there is only a short - range magnetic exchange interaction.@xcite we speculate that the high-@xmath0  values reported for thin films@xcite are actually belonging to the here - reported bulk high-@xmath0  phase ( while the low-@xmath0  phase line is probably the one which was observed and reported in the old literature ref .  ) .",
    "high @xmath0  values are only reported for thin films with small @xmath12 which were grown at comparably low temperatures @xmath93  k,@xcite i.e. , in the same temperature window which was found in this study to trigger the formation of the high-@xmath0  phase in our samples .",
    "therefore the proposed spinodal decomposition mechanism is probably the intrinsic origin for the existence of the high-@xmath0  magnetic phase in ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te .",
    "another interesting issue is the size of the mn clusters formed due to the spinodal decomposition . for bulk",
    "ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te  we estimated an average mn cluster size to be several tens of nanometers by employing scherrers formula to the broadened xrd patterns of controlled - cooled powder samples with large @xmath0  values .",
    "we also estimated the mean - free path of a sample with @xmath94 , high-@xmath0  phase , from preliminary transport measurements .",
    "the mean - free path is smaller than 10  nm and this makes sense since the enhancement of @xmath0  could not occur if the mn cluster size were smaller than the mean - free path and the inhomogeneity of the mn concentration were averaged out .",
    "this is an interesting starting point for future studies on the ferromagnetism realised in ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te .",
    "one might speculate whether it could also be possible to gain control over the magnetic - phase - switching process by electronic means , i.e. , whether it is possible to switch the magnetic phases by electric fields utilising the ferroelectric distortion which sets in upon cooling through @xmath95  k. unfortunately the semiconductor gete is a fairly good metal with room - temperature values of the longitudinal resistivity of a few 100  @xmath96 cm and unintentionally self - doped charge carrier concentrations @xmath97 of the order of @xmath98  @xmath16 . to drive the magnetic phase change by electrical fields",
    ", one has to reduce @xmath97 .",
    "mn doping alone does not seem to reduce @xmath97 sufficiently , at least in the doping range in question , i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "in general , the role of the density of the self - doped charge carriers in ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te  remains an open question .",
    "in diluted magnetic semiconductors , the ferromagnetic interaction is generally believed to depend on the charge carrier concentration,@xcite which was also reported for thin films of ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te.@xcite    in conclusion we report the finding that a different heat treatment ( quenching vs.  slow cooling ) results in either of two competing ferromagnetic phases with significantly different ordering temperatures @xmath0  in the bulk diluted magnetic semiconductor ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te .",
    "the high-@xmath0  phase partly resembles a spin- or cluster - glass state with maximum ordering temperatures of up to @xmath100k around @xmath24 which had not been reported before .",
    "it is characterized by an inhomogeneous distribution of the doped mn@xmath10 ions due to a spinodal decomposition taking place upon slow cooling from above the ferroelectric transition temperature ( @xmath101  k ) .",
    "the low-@xmath0  phase is more homogeneous and closer to conventional ferromagnetic order .",
    "the two phases merge around @xmath102 . at the same time the ferroelectric lattice distortion vanishes .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated that repeated switching back and forth between the two distinct phases is possible by either quenching ( high-@xmath0  to low-@xmath0 ) or controlled cooling ( low-@xmath0  to high-@xmath0 ) .",
    "this adds another interesting feature to the intriguing semiconductor gete in terms of a magnetic phase - change - memory functionality .",
    "* sample preparation and characterization .",
    "* polycrystals of ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te  for nominally @xmath103 were grown by conventional melt growth and bridgman methods .",
    "stoichiometric mixtures of gete ( purity : 5n ) and mnte ( 3n+ ) were thoroughly mixed and sealed into evacuated quartz glass tubes . in the conventional melt growth runs , the batches were heated to 1073 - 1123  k ( melting point of gete : @xmath104  k ; upon mn doping",
    "it gradually increases to @xmath105  k for @xmath106.@xcite ) , kept there for 1224  h and subsequently cooled down to approximately 900  k which is still in the cubic high - temperature phase for all samples examined here ( gete : @xmath107  k ; upon mn doping @xmath108 decreases ) .",
    "then the batches were ( i ) slowly cooled ( 5  k / h ) to room temperature or ( ii ) quenched into water . in the bridgman growth method ,",
    "the upper heater was set to 1123  k and the lower to 623  k. the mixed powder was kept at the upper heater s temperature for 1224  h. then the batch was slowly lowered ( 2  mm / h ) from the upper heater towards the lower heater and again ( i ) slowly cooled down , or ( ii ) the quartz tubes were quenched when the batch position corresponded to approximately 900  k. we tried different annealing times at 900  k without finding any impact on the magnetic phase , which implies that the relevant temperature range for the clustering process during the slow - cooling process is below that temperature .",

    "<S> cross - control of a material property  </S>",
    "<S> manipulation of a physical quantity ( e.g. , magnetisation ) by a nonconjugate field ( e.g. , electrical field )  is a challenge in fundamental science and also important for technological device applications . </S>",
    "<S> it has been demonstrated that magnetic properties can be controlled by electrical and optical stimuli in various magnets . </S>",
    "<S> here we find that heat - treatment allows the control over two competing magnetic phases in the mn - doped polar semiconductor gete . </S>",
    "<S> the onset temperatures @xmath0  of ferromagnetism vary at low mn concentrations by a factor of five to six with a maximum @xmath1  k , depending on the selected phase . </S>",
    "<S> analyses in terms of synchrotron x - ray diffraction and energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy indicate a possible segregation of the mn ions , which is responsible for the high-@xmath0  phase . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we demonstrate that the two states can be switched back and forth repeatedly from either phase by changing the heat - treatment of a sample , thereby confirming magnetic phase - change - memory functionality .    successful cross - control of material properties has been reported or proposed for various external stimuli , such as electric field ( or electric current),@xcite magnetic field,@xcite light,@xcite and heat.@xcite among them , heat is a particularly important stimulus since it allows for the manipulation of the state of matter through its ability to alter the free energy landscape of a system and to realize a metastable state , depending on cooling kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> one such example is a switching phenomenon between ( atomic ) amorphous and crystal phases as observed in gete - related materials,@xcite or between charge - glass and charge - crystal phases in organic materials,@xcite where optical reflectivity or electrical resistivity of the system changes significantly , depending on which phase is realized ( namely , depending on the cooling speed after the heat injection ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon in gete - related materials is applied as phase - change memory in digital versatile disks ( dvd).@xcite    in addition to the phase - change memory function , gete exhibits various intriguing properties , such as a many - valley band structure,@xcite superconductivity,@xcite and thermoelectricity.@xcite the @xmath2-type charge carriers in this system are unintentionally self - doped due to ge vacancies.@xcite it also exhibits a ferroelectric transition at approximately 700  k , where the structure changes from its high - temperature cubic ( @xmath3 ; @xmath4gete ) to the low - temperature rhombohedral phase ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6gete),@xcite with a polar distortion along the cubic [ 111 ] direction [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> recently the system was predicted@xciteand found@xcite to exhibit a giant rashba spin - splitting in the bulk , associated with broken inversion symmetry and large spin - orbit interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> gete also offers the possibility of enhanced magnetic interactions and applicability in spintronics devices : magnetism is induced in gete when doping with cr , mn , or fe at the ge site,@xcite forming a family of diluted magnetic semiconductors similar with ( gamn)as or ( ga , mn)n.@xcite recently , the possibility of multiferroicity has been claimed in this multifunctional system due to the coexistence of magnetism and ferroelectric distortion.@xcite among the gete - based doped systems , ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te  has been intensively studied . </S>",
    "<S> single - phase gete  </S>",
    "<S> mnte solid solutions exist over a broad range of concentration up to @xmath9.@xcite the partial substitution of ge@xmath10 with isovalent mn@xmath10 reduces the ferroelectric distortion and stabilises the cubic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the opposite end member mnte is an antiferromagnet crystallizing in a different structure with the hexagonal space group @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the onset temperature @xmath0  of magnetic order was reported to increase linearly with @xmath12 with maximum values around 165  k for @xmath13.@xcite more recent works have focussed on thin films of ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te , finding a carrier - induced enhancement of the @xmath0  values up to 200  k for @xmath14 and hole concentrations of about @xmath15  @xmath16.@xcite the emergence of ferromagnetism in bulk and thin films of ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te  has been considered in an rkky framework plus possible antiferromagnetic correlations by mn  </S>",
    "<S> mn direct exchange.@xcite    in this article , we focus on the low - doped region of the phase diagram @xmath17 for bulk ge@xmath7mn@xmath8te , where we found a feature which had been overlooked so far . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1](b ) , there are two distinct magnetic phases , depending on the heat - treatment of the samples , with rather different values of @xmath0 , called herein low-@xmath0  and high-@xmath0  phase . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the high-@xmath0  phase was identified as the formation of mn - rich / mn - poor regions in terms of state - of - the - art synchrotron x - ray diffraction and energy dispersive x - ray analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we also successfully demonstrated that samples can be repeatedly switched from the low-@xmath0  into the high-@xmath0  phase and vice versa by changing the heat treatment . </S>",
    "<S> the latter adds another interesting feature to the multifunctional semiconductor gete , namely magnetic phase - change - memory functionality . </S>"
