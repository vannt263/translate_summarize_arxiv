    "the expected low neutrino - induced muon event rate , even for the brightest @xmath2-ray blazars @xcite and grbs @xcite , and the increasing importance of the cosmic - ray induced neutrino background at lower energies @xcite , means that event detection is greatly improved by choosing appropriate time windows during periods of highest neutrino luminosity .",
