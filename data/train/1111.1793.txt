    "low - mass stars are well known to exhibit a range of stellar activity phenomena @xcite , and the prevalence of active stars is observed to decrease as a function of age ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the more energetic byproducts of stellar activity are flares , which are thought to be produced by magnetic reconnection in the atmospheres of cool stars .",
    "active m dwarfs exhibit some of the more energetic and highest rate of flares amongst cool stars @xcite .",
    "m dwarf flares can last from minutes to many hours , exhibit u - band flux enhancements of a factor of several hundred above quiescence , and emit energies of up to e@xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ergs @xcite .",
    "the optical white - light emission has been shown to be fit by a two component model comprised of balmer continuum emission plus a t @xmath010,000k blackbody component @xcite .",
    "although m dwarf flares are most conspicuous at radio , blue optical , and x - ray wavelengths @xcite , @xcite has recently presented the clear detection of ir ( 0.95 - 2.46@xmath10 m ) flare signatures in h i paschen lines , h i br@xmath11 , and the he i 10830   line during events confirmed with simultaneous optical photometry .",
    "several solar flares have also been detected in the continuum region near 1.56@xmath10 m in the ir , near the h@xmath12 opacity minimum , implying formation deep within the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "some types of stellar activity have already been observed to `` contaminate '' exoplanet detection and characterization studies . variations in the appearance and depth of transit light curves have been observed for fgkm host stars @xcite and in transmission spectra of the m dwarf gl 436 @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggest that uv flux from chromospherically active stars may destroy the atmospheric compounds responsible for producing temperature inversions observed in the atmospheres of exoplanets orbiting less active stars .",
    "although m dwarfs are known to exhibit a range of activity , the magnitude of such variability in ir continuum bandpasses relevant to the detection ( via primary transits ) and characterization ( via secondary transits and phase mapping ) of exoplanets remains poorly understood .",
    "marginal variability that may be due to flares was seen in a statistical investigation of single - epoch 2mass calibration data @xcite .",
    "that study is complementary to the simultaneous monitoring observations reported here , which provide flare rates for individual stars .",
    "the few previous simultaneous optical - ir observations of m dwarf flares report anomalous ir flux decrements during optical flares @xcite or null detections @xcite .",
    "we caution however that the observational techniques and analyses of these simultaneous photometric studies were dubious and not optimized for precision ir photometry",
    ".    could the 5 milli - mag transit signal of a super - earth residing in the habitable zone around a m5v star @xcite be routinely masked by stellar activity and flares when observed in the ir ? in this paper , we present simultaneously obtained , high time cadence optical and ir photometric monitoring of well known active m dwarfs at milli - mag precision to address this question .",
    "we used a suite of 3 optical photometric facilities and 1 ir photometric facility to obtain simultaneous broad - band optical and ir photometry of three active m dwarfs known to exhibit frequent flares , between 2009 october 2 - 7 and 2011 february 11 - 16 .",
    "the blue optical photometric data were obtained to identify the onset and characterize the energy of flare events , whereas the red optical photometry was used to help characterize the color of flares . a basic summary of the targets observed at each observational facility , along with exposure times , filters used , and observing cadences is presented in table [ obssum ] .",
    "most of our 2009 observing run was lost due to a tropical storm hitting kpno , while poor weather and instrument failures only affected @xmath02 nights of our 2011 observing run .      the astrophysical research consortium small aperture telescope ( arcsat ) 0.5 m at the apache point observatory ( apo ) was one of three facilities we used to obtain high candence optical photometry .",

    "further details about the nmsu 1 m and its operations are described by @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced using an automatic photometry pipeline , yielding differential photometry for our science targets .    during our 2009 observing run we also obtained simultaneous optical monitoring of our science targets with the wisconsin indiana yale noao ( wiyn ) 0.9 m telescope .",

    "we employed 2 x 2 binning of the s2 kb chip , and a 260 x 260 pixel sub - array of the full frame , to reduce read out time and obtain higher cadence photometry .",
    "the data we present were obtained in the harris _ u _ band filter .",
    "nightly bias and dome flat field frames were obtained , and the data were reduced using standard iraf techniques .",

    "our science exposures were generally obtained at or near the array s minimum exposure time of 0.874 seconds , and we defocussed the telescope until stars took the appearance of @xmath020@xmath14 - @xmath028@xmath14 -wide donuts , to keep the counts below the array s linearity limit . because of large overheads in the transmission of data from the array , our net observing cadence was @xmath060 seconds ( table [ obssum ] ) .",
    "night - time , deep blank - sky images were obtained every clear night to serve as sky flats ; dark frames were also obtained every day corresponding to the integration times of our sky flats .",
    "we used a 3 - 4 dither point pattern in order to mitigate ghosts produced from observing bright sources . since we were interested in performing differential photometry ,",
    "the specific number and pattern of dither points we adopted varied by source , to ensure each frame contained our science target and at least 1 comparison star .",
    "we periodically adjusted the position of the science target on the array to ensure that small amplitude , long time - scale telescope tracking imperfections did not cause the target to fall on different pixels , thus making it more susceptible to imperfections in the flat fielding process .",
    "we developed a custom data reduction routine to extract the highest precision photometry possible .",
    "we first applied a third order linearity correction to the data using coefficients in the sqiid user s manual , and then divided these data by a normalized flat field image .",
    "sky subtraction and dark correction of our science images was achieved by subtracting immediately adjacent dither frames from each other .",
    "individual pixels @xmath816,000 adus ( the linearity limit ) or @xmath5 -500 adus were next flagged as bad or warm pixels , and corrected using the iraf routine _",
    "fixpix_. next , low - level array artifacts , such as column banding and less frequently observed row banding , were characterized by sampling this structure in star - free regions of the array and removed via custom idl routines .    to obtain photometry for our sqiid data",
    ", we first identified the centroid position of each star in our fovs using sextractor @xcite , and a custom reference profile which mimicked the extended donut - shape of our sources .",
    "next , we ran these stellar positions through iraf s _ phot _ routine to extract aperture photometry , using a target aperture of radius 20 pixels ( ev lac and yz cmi ) to 24 pixels ( ad leo ) and a 4 pixel wide background sky annulus starting at a radius of 30 pixels from each centroid position .",
    "we then extracted differential photometry for our science targets using the brightest , and often only , comparison star with the sqiid fov , as summarized in table [ comp ] .",
    "previous ir monitoring programs dedicated to observing m dwarfs for transits ( mearth ; @xcite ) or high precision observations of brown dwarfs to characterize photospheric condensates @xcite have described how variations in relative humidity can affect ir differential photometry .",
    "we found we were able to remove most of the small amplitude , long time - scale photometric trends in our data likely attributable to these effects by simply fitting a linear function to each dither position s light curve individually .",
    "finally , each dither position was normalized to a uniform scale and combined to yield the highest time cadence differential photometry from our observations .",
    "table [ flaresum ] summarizes the relative photometric stability we were able to obtain for every target and filter , both across an entire night and across 1-hour windows , quantified as the observed standard deviation .",
    "the ir stability we achieved for ad leo , 9.7 - 12.6 milli - mags over a full night and 8.4 - 10.5 milli - mags over a 1 hour window , was systematically larger than that achieved for our other targets due to the lower flux of the brightest comparison star in its field of view .",
    "the best ir photometric stability we achieved was an impressive 5.1 - 6.0 milli - mags over a full night and 3.8 - 3.9 milli - mags over a 1 hour window for our 2011 february 13 monitoring of yz cmi .",
    "figure [ adleoall ] shows a representative multi - filter differential photometric light curve obtained for the star ad leo on 2011 february 13 .",
    "note that photon statistics - based error bars are plotted in all panels of figure [ adleoall ] , and for all figures in this paper , but these error bars are generally smaller than the size of the data points . before characterizing the behavior of stellar flares in our ir data , we first identified these events in our simultaneously obtained optical photometry .",
    "we used the idl - based flare finding software described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "flares are identified as a single epoch which is 3.5-@xmath17 brighter than the standard deviation of the local mean , followed by three epochs which are 2-@xmath17 above the local mean .",
    "each flare identified was also double - checked by eye to confirm the event was robust .",
    "the total number of flares detected in each bandpass using this flare finding algorithm is shown in table [ flaresum ] ; a total of 20 flares were detected in our _ u_-band data .    for the larger optical flare events observed , additional flare properties such as the peak magnitude enhancement and total flare duration",
    "are compiled in table [ flarenergy ] .",
    "flare equivalent durations , defined as the amount of time each star would need to spend at a quiescent level to produce the same total energy as during each flare @xcite , were determined via our flare finding software by integration under each light curve .",
    "we adopted the quiescent luminosities for ad leo ( 1.59 x 10@xmath18 ergs s@xmath15 ) , ev lac ( 6.63 x 10@xmath19 ergs s@xmath15 ) , and yz cmi ( 4.57 x 10@xmath19 ergs s@xmath15 ) computed by @xcite and @xcite , and based on data in @xcite .",
    "we then multiplied the quiescent luminosities by the equivalent duration of each event , to extract flare energies ( table [ flarenergy ] ) .      as the focus of this paper is on characterizing the properties of stellar flares in the ir ,",
    "we focus our attention on the four largest u - band flares we observed on ad leo ( event # 1 ) , yz cmi ( events # 2 & # 3 ) , and ev lac ( event # 4 ) , as listed in table [ flarenergy ] and illustrated in figure [ adleozoom ] .",
    "our flares exhibited _",
    "u_-band energies ranging from @xmath07.8 x 10@xmath1 ( event # 4 ) to @xmath01.3 x 10@xmath2 ( event # 1 ) ergs .",
    "flare events # 1 - 3 are considered strong @xcite although they are less energetic than the very rare @xmath010@xmath9 erg megaflare @xcite observed on yz cmi .    for each of our targets",
    ", @xcite presented flare frequency distributions which follow power laws , except at the lowest and highest energy regimes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite expanded upon this earlier work , presenting flare frequency distributions for a wider range of m dwarfs . after correcting for detection efficiency ,",
    "@xcite was able to demonstrate that flare frequency distributions follow power law distributions even down to low energies .",
    "we use the flare frequency distributions presented in @xcite and @xcite for this paper . note that since the flare energies we computed in table [ flarenergy ] used the same quiescent stellar luminosities employed to construct the hilton et al flare frequency distributions , any future refinements of these quiescent luminosities",
    "will not influence the flare rates we hereafter cite .",
    "we determine that a flare having equal or greater _",
    "u_-band energy to our event # 1 , on ad leo , would occur less than once per 18 hours . for yz cmi , we find that a flare having equal or greater _ u_-band energy for events # 2 - 3 would occur less than once per 10 hours , and the ev lac flare frequency distribution indicates that a flare having equal or greater _",
    "u_-band energy to our event # 4 would occur less than once per 7 hours .",
    "we utilized the same flare finding algorithm described in section [ results ] and used to identify flares in our optical data to search for contemporaneous flares in our full set of ir data .",
    "we detected no statistically significant deviations in our ir photometry at the epochs of the four major , optically detected flares .",
    "we quantify the 1-@xmath17 upper limits of these four events by computing the standard deviation of all data in a 40 minute time window before each event , and summarize these limits in table [ flarenergy ] .",
    "our _ u_-band photometry provides us with information about the starting time of each flare event . as seen in figure [ adleoall ] and demonstrated by many others ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the total duration of flares in the optical is color dependent .",
    "flare # 1 in our survey , for example , was visible in the _ u _ filter for 10x longer than it was in the _ i _ filter ( table [ flarenergy ] ) .",
    "we therefore estimated upper limits to the duration which each flare event would be visible in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ ks _ filters by adopting the duration of each event in the reddest optical filter in which it was detected ( e.g. the _ i_-band for event # 1 ) .",
    "our observing cadence ( table [ obssum ] ) constrains the uncertainty in the durations we quote .",
    "this information enabled us to time bin our data , as shown in figures [ event1j ] , [ event1h ] , and [ event1k ] for the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ ks _ filters respectively , to intervals which would create two data points ( i.e. @xmath02 minute binning ) and 1 data point ( i.e. @xmath04 minute binning ) across the upper limit duration of each event .",
    "as flare light curves can exhibit significant changes over 2 - 4 minute intervals ( see e.g. figure [ adleoall ] ) , binning our data to these longer cadences could cause flare signatures to be diminished .",
    "conversely , binning will help to reduce the dispersion of quiescent - phase data , and therefore could help elucidate the presence of low - amplitude slowly varying events , such as the long - duration flare shape of @xcite .",
    "however , even the binned data did not reveal a statistically significant event in the ir .",
    "following practices described in @xcite , we also computed a welch and stetson variability index @xcite , @xmath20 , for each epoch of our data .",
    "this type of variability index builds on the principle that the photometric variations we are searching for should appear at similar time epochs across multiple filters ; hence , it serves as a way to identify faint signals common to each of our _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ ks _ filter data . in practice ,",
    "the index is computed simply by :    @xmath21    where the flux in each multiplicative term is determined from each filter s differential photometry light curve . the resultant @xmath20 index for our unbinned , @xmath02 minute binned , and @xmath04 minute binned data exhibited no statistically significant change during the time of each flare event , as shown in figure [ phi1 ] for event # 1 , as compared to the value of the index preceeding and following each event .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that our ir observing cadence ( table [ obssum ] ) of one ( 0.874 second ) integration every @xmath060 seconds does not influence our ability to detect the optically observed flare events . to help better quantify whether our observations could miss ir responses to flares which begin and end on time - scales faster than the relative observing cadence we achieved , we identified the time of the peak flare emission during each event , as listed in table [ flaretime ] .",
    "the quoted error bars on these times correspond to the epoch of the prior and subsequent integration in each filter .",
    "we also list the epochs of the nearest 1 - 2 ir observations in table [ flaretime ] relative to the observed epoch of the peak @xmath3__u__-band flux .",
    "the epochs of our ir observations essentially overlap with the epochs of the observed peak @xmath3__u__-band flux for flare events # 1,3,and 4 to within the timing uncertainties .",
    "our closest ir integration for flare event # 2 was 18.5 seconds after the oberved @xmath3u - band peak , which is larger than the @xmath2213 second uncertainty in the epoch of the peak @xmath3__u__-band flux .",
    "these data quantify the limits at which our different optical versus ir observing cadences could have resulted in the non - detection of flare events .",
    "we conclude that , at the limit of our observational data , we find no compelling evidence of flare enhancements in our _ j _ , _ h _ , or _ ks _ filter data during the @xmath07.8 x 10@xmath1 to @xmath01.3 x 10@xmath2 erg _",
    "u_-band flares we detected .",
    "we have presented the results of @xmath047 hours of high cadence , high precision , simultaneous optical and ir photometric monitoring of 3 active m dwarfs .",
    "we now discuss the interpretation of these results in the context of the effects that stellar flares could have on a variety of m dwarf exoplanet studies . for reference ,",
    "we remind the reader that a super - earth ( 2 r@xmath23 ) residing in the habitable zone around a dm5 star ( @xmath00.074 au separation ; see e.g. @xcite ) would have an orbital period of 14.5 days and a transit duration of @xmath02 hours .      in section [ irflares ]",
    "we demonstrated that during four significant optical flare events , having _",
    "u_-band energies ranging from @xmath07.8 x 10@xmath1 to @xmath01.3 x 10@xmath2 ergs , we observed no statistically significant evidence of corresponding broad - band enhancements in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ ks _ filters at the 5.1 - 11.7 milli - mag level .",
    "these upper limits were computed from the standard deviation of all data in a 40 minute time window before each flare .",
    "we quantified the relative frequency that one would expect for flares with energies similar to events # 1 - 4 in section [ opticalflares ] , using flare frequency distributions observed for our specific dme stars in @xcite and @xcite . by combining these two observational properties",
    ", we can place upper limits on the effects of stellar flares on future continuum - based observations of m dwarf exoplanetary systems . for active m3ve stars ,",
    "we find that a @xmath01.3 x 10@xmath2 erg _ u_-band flare will induce @xmath58.3 , @xmath58.5 , and @xmath511.7 milli - mags of an effect in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ ks _ filters respectively",
    ". a flare of this energy or greater should occur less than once per 18 hours .",
    "for active m4.5e stars , we find that a @xmath05.1 x 10@xmath6 erg _ u_-band flare will induce @xmath57.8 , @xmath58.8 , and @xmath55.1 milli - mags of an effect in the j , h , and ks filters respectively .",
    "a flare of this energy or greater should occur less than once per 10 hours .",
    "moreover , we observe no evidence of stellar variability not associated with discrete flare events at the level of @xmath83.9 ( _ j _ ) , @xmath83.8 ( _ h _ ) , and @xmath83.9 ( _ ks _ ) milli - mags over 1 hour time - scales and no level of stellar variability at the level of @xmath86.0 ( _ j _ ) , @xmath85.6 ( _ h _ ) , and @xmath85.1 milli - mags over 7.5 hour time - scales .",
    "these data provide quantitative upper limits to the level of broad - band stellar variability which could be expected in ir transit and phase mapping observations of m dwarfs .",
    "although multi - wavelength radiative hydrodynamic modeling of solar and dme flares has been constructed @xcite , we are not aware of any suite of detailed low mass star flare models in the existing literature that present model ir fluxes .",
    "@xcite begins to mitigate this deficiency by adopting the two component flare emission model of @xcite , comprised of balmer continuum predictions by radiative hydrodynamic flare models of @xcite and a t @xmath010,000k blackbody , and extrapolating this model to predict expected fluxes over a range of optical and ir filters . for our flare event # 1 ( table [ flarenergy ] ) , this model predicts a peak _ i_-band flux enhancement ( @xmath00.02 mag ) which is within a factor of 2 of our observed value of 0.04 magnitudes and predicts an ir response of 3.5 milli - mags ( _ j_-band ) , 2.1 milli - mags ( _ h_-band ) , and 1.8 milli - mags ( _ ks_-band ) which is consistent with the upper limits we set observationally in section [ irflares ] .    using the @xcite extrapolations",
    ", we explore the level of flare which would need to occur to be detected by our observing program , given the typical standard deviation of our ir data during epochs of observed flares , @xmath08 milli - mags . for a dm3e star ,",
    "these models suggest a flare exhibiting a peak _ u_-band enhancement of 2.6 magnitudes ( i.e. one magnitude greater than our largest flare ) would have produced _",
    "j_-band ( 11.6 milli - mags ) , _ h_-band ( 6.8 milli - mags ) , and _ ks_-band ( 5.7 milli - mags ) responses which would have been detected by our observational program . constraining the frequency of such large flares",
    "is difficult as observed flare frequency distributions deviate from simple power laws at high energies @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we can conservatively state that the frequency of such events should be less than once per 35 hours .",
    "we also note that the e@xmath24 @xmath810@xmath9 ergs megaflare on yz cmi reported by @xcite was also detected by the mearth monitoring program @xcite , which observes with an i+z filter @xcite .",
    "this @xmath06 magnitude u band event @xcite produced a @xmath00.6 magnitude enhancement in the mearth ( i+z ) filter ( irwin 2011 ; personal communication ) , which is generally consistent with the predicted level of enhancement from @xcite .",
    "for that flare , the model predicts _ j_-band ( 119 milli - mag ) , _ h_-band ( 77 milli - mag ) , and _ ks_-band ( 62 milli - mag ) enhancements , which are significantly larger than our photometric noise floor .",
    "although we did not observe such a large flare , which @xcite suggest should occur at a rate of once per month , we speculate that such events will easily be detectable in future ir observations of m dwarfs .",
    "the @xcite observational and modeling work which formed the basis of the extrapolations computed by @xcite is unique in that it provided convincing evidence that the blue optical properties of flares could be reproduced by 2 components , a balmer continuum predicted by radiative hydrodynamic flare models @xcite and a t @xmath010,000k blackbody .",
    "this framework represents an important step towards advancing our understanding of flares ; however , it is phenomenological in nature and by design does nt reproduce the entire myriad of observational characteristics of flares .",
    "@xcite , for example , suggest that additional components from h i paschen continuum emission and photospheric backwarming can reproduce the residual observed flux from 5000 - 5500  , which is nt accounted for in the 2-component computation .",
    "it is therefore plausible that including additional components relevant to the _",
    "j , h , ks _ wavelength regime , such as brackett and pfund continuum emission , could also be important .",
    "although extrapolating a blue / near - uv continuum model may not yield a complete description of the ir flare continuum , we suggest extrapolations like those presented in @xcite and adopted here can provide an order of magnitude guidance on the expected ir response of flares .",
    "although beyond the scope of this paper , future models of stellar flares should consider providing broad - band flux predictions at ir wavelengths to the community , to complement the observational constraints provided by this work .      since the discovery of sodium in the atmosphere of hd 209458b by @xcite , transmission spectroscopy has been recognized as one of the best ways to directly probe the chemistry of exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "the technique has been successfully employed with current ground- and space - based facilities , leading to detections of atmospheric molecules like water , methane , carbon monoxide , and carbon dioxide @xcite , and is anticipated to play an important role in characterizing the atmospheres of exoplanets once jwst is operational ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this context , we note that @xcite reported the first detection of ir line emission in h i br@xmath11 during a @xmath04 x 10@xmath2 erg ( _ u_-band energy ) flare on ev lac , whereby the line flux was enhanced during the flare by @xmath05% above quiescent values . @xcite also reported the presence of h i pa@xmath25 , pa@xmath11 , and pa@xmath26 emission during three separate flare events with _",
    "u_-band ( and also _",
    "u_-band ) energies @xmath04 x 10@xmath6 to @xmath04 x 10@xmath2 ergs , with observed line flux enhancements of 5 - 20% above that observed in quiescence .",
    "the expected rate , i.e. duty cycle , of ir line emission was estimated to be @xmath03% for active mid - m dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "the widths of these lines are much smaller than the widths of molecular features being characterized in current exoplanet studies , and therefore should not preclude investigations of the atmospheric molecular content of exoplanets surrounding m dwarfs .",
    "however , efforts to interpret future transmission spectroscopy observations of m dwarfs should allow for the possibility of variable stellar h i line flux at the 5 - 20% level , with a duty cycle of @xmath03% .",
    "if observed in broad - band filters , these line flux enhancements would produce enhancements of 0.4 milli - mags ( _ j_-band ) to 0.3 milli - mags ( _ ks_-band ) , significantly below the upper limits of the ir photometric stability presented in section [ irflares ] .",

    "* future ir transmission spectroscopic studies of m dwarf exoplanets should note that 5 - 20% flux enhancements have been observed in h i paschen and br@xmath11 lines during flares having total energies similar to event # 1 in our survey .",
