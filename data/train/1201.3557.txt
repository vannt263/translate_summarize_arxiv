    "n.  l.  white and w.  whiteley in  @xcite started the investigation of geometric conditions for a tensegrity with prescribed bars and cables . in the preprint  @xcite m.  de  guzmn describes several other examples of geometric conditions for tensegrities .",

    "a _ stratum _ is by definition a maximal connected set of points with equivalent linear fibers . in the paper",

    "the idea of this paper is to make the first steps in the study of particular configuration spaces of tensegrities .",
    "we present the techniques to find geometric conditions and open problems for further study that already arise in very simple situations of 9 point configurations .",
    "let us , first , make the following three _",
    "general remarks_.    * gr1 .",
    "* the majority of the strata of codimension @xmath39 can be defined by algebraic equations and inequalities that define the strata of codimension  1 .",
    "the exceptions here are mostly in high codimension ( the simplest one is as follows : for two points connected by an edge there is no codimension 1 stratum , but there is one codimension 2 stratum corresponding to coinciding points ; actually it is interesting to find the complete list of such exceptions ) .",
    "so the most important case to study is the codimension 1 case .",
    "a stratification of a subgraph is a substratification of the original graph ( i.e. , each stratum for a subgraph is the union of certain strata for the original graph ) , hence below we skip the description of @xmath40 for graphs with 5 vertices other than @xmath41 .",
    "* gr3 . * for any stratum there exists a certain subgraph that _ locally identifies _ the stratum ( i.e. , for any point @xmath42 of the stratum there exists a neighborhood @xmath43 such that any configuration in @xmath43 has a nonzero self stress for the subgraph if and only if this point is on the stratum ) .    according to general remarks",
    "gr1 and gr2 the most interesting case is to study the strata of codimension 1 for the complete graph on @xmath3 vertices ( denoted further by @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is possible to find some of the strata of @xmath44 directly . for the other strata one ,",
    "first , should find an appropriate subgraph that locally identifies the stratum , and then find appropriate surgeries ( explained in section  3 ) to reduce the complexity of the subgraph to find geometric conditions .",
    "* this paper is organized as follows . * in section  2 we study the stratification of configuration spaces of tensegrities in the plane with a small number of vertices . in subsections  2.1 and  2.2",
    "we briefly describe the trivial cases of two and three point configurations . further in subsections  2.3 and  2.4",
    "we study the four and the five point cases . in each of the cases we describe the geometry and the number of strata .",
    "in addition we introduce the adjacency diagram of full dimension and codimension 1 strata . in subsections  2.5 and  2.6",
    "we describe geometric conditions for the codimension 1 strata of 6 , 7 , and 8 point tensegrities . in section  3",
    "we present the technique of surgeries to find geometric descriptions for the strata . in subsection  3.1",
    "we describe surgeries that do not change graphs , and in subsection  3.2 we show a couple of surgeries in the two - dimensional case .",
    "we introduce a new three - dimensional surgery in subsection  3.3 . in conclusion",
    ", we formulate several open questions in subsection  3.4 .",
    "in this section we study the geometry of tensegrity stratifications for graphs with a small number of vertices . the cases of @xmath46 are studied in full detail . starting from @xmath47",
    "there are some gaps in the understanding of tensegrities .",
    "still for @xmath48 the complete description of the geometric conditions for the strata is known , we briefly describe several results on them here ( see  @xcite for more information ) .",
    "consider , first , the case of two points ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "there are only two graphs on two points : a complete one @xmath50 and a graph without edges ( denote it by @xmath51 ) .",
    "all the fibers of the base @xmath52 are of dimension 0 , and , therefore , they are equivalent .",
    "hence the stratification is trivial .",
    "the complete graph @xmath50 here has only one edge .",
    "if two points of the graph do not coincide then the stress at this edge should be zero .",
    "when two points coincide then the stress at the edge can be arbitrary , and we have a one - dimensional set of solutions ( i.e. , a fiber ) .",
    "so the base @xmath53 has a codimension 2 stratum ( a 2-dimensional plane ) .",
    "the complement to this stratum is a stratum of codimension 0 .",
    "there are four different types of graphs here : let @xmath54 be the graph with @xmath15 edges for @xmath55 .    in cases @xmath56 and @xmath57 the base stratifications are the following direct products : @xmath58 so @xmath59 is trivial and @xmath60 has a 4-dimensional subspace and its complement as strata .",
    "the base @xmath61 contains five strata .",
    "one of them corresponds to the configuration where three points coincide : the fiber here is 2-dimensional , this stratum is isometric to @xmath62 .",
    "there are three strata where one of the edges of the graph vanishes : they are isometric to @xmath63 . finally , the complement to the union of these strata is the only stratum of maximal dimension .",
    "there are no nonzero tensegrities for a configuration in this stratum .    for the complete graph on three vertices we have , for the first time , codimension 1 strata .",
    "there are three codimension 1 strata , all of them correspond to the following configuration : three points are in one line .",
    "different strata correspond to having a different point between the two others .",
    "let us briefly describe one of such strata . let @xmath64 be the points of the graph ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "then the condition that the three points are in a line is defined by a quadratic equation : @xmath66 this quadric divides the space into two connected components : corresponding to positively and negatively oriented triangles .    to sum up we present for @xmath67 the following table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      let us now describe the structure of the stratification @xmath68 .",
    "like in case of @xmath69 we introduce a set @xmath70 which represents the adjacency of strata of full dimension and of codimension 1 . by definition we put @xmath71 i.e.",
    ", we consider all the four point configurations of @xmath72 , and to each configuration we add the fifth point .",
    "we take the product topology for @xmath70 .",
    "so at each point of @xmath72 we attach an @xmath62-fiber .",
    "it will soon become clear that for any full dimension stratum of @xmath72 the corresponding fibration is trivial , but the adjacency is not .    on figures  [ b1k3_1 ] and  [ b1k3_2 ]",
    "we show @xmath70 in the following way .",
    "we draw the stratification of @xmath72 and inside each connected component we show the typical fiber of the component .",
    "the first four points are represented by purple , blue , green , and red points .",
    "the lines passing through any pair of them divide the fiber into 18 connected components , that correspond to strata of full dimension . at each such component",
    "we write a letter of the latin alphabet ( we consider capital and small letters as distinct ) .",
    "* two regions denoted by the same letter and lying in neighboring connected components of @xmath72 separated by light red , dark red , and black strata are in the same stratum .",
    "* two regions denoted by the same letter and lying in neighboring connected components of @xmath72 separated by light blue , dark blue , light green , and dark green strata are in distinct strata which are adjacent to the same codimension 1 stratum . *",
    "two regions denoted by a distinct letter and lying in neighboring connected components of @xmath72 are not in one stratum and are not adjacent to the same codimension 1 stratum .",
    "the light blue , dark blue , light green , and dark green strata represent the same geometric conditions as in remark  [ color1 ] above . for the remaining strata we have :    * the dark red stratum symbolizes that the line through the red and blue points is parallel to the line through the green and purple points . *",
    "the light red stratum symbolizes that the line through the red and purple points is parallel to the line through the green and blue points . *",
    "the black stratum symbolizes that the line through the red and green points is parallel to the line through the purple and blue points .",
    "the configuration space @xmath68 has several obvious symmetries .",
    "first , there is the group of permutations @xmath73 that acts on the points of @xmath68 ; these symmetries are hardly seen from figures  [ b1k3_1 ] and  [ b1k3_2 ] since the representation is not @xmath73-symmetric .",
    "secondly , there is a symmetry about the origin that sends configurations from @xmath68 to themselves , on figures  [ b1k3_1 ] and  [ b1k3_2 ] we used capital and small letters to indicate this symmetry ( for instance , the strata of  a  contain centrally symmetric configurations to the configurations of the strata  a  ) .",
    "@xmath74    @xmath75    as in the case of 4 point configurations we skip the subgraphs of @xmath41 , see the second general remark above ( gr2 ) .",
    "the stratification of @xmath76 is much more complicated , at this moment we do not even know how many strata of distinct dimension are present in the stratification .    according to gr1",
    "the first step in studying the stratification of @xmath76 is to study all possible distinct types of strata of codimension  1 .",
    "in the examples of @xmath44 for @xmath77 we only have strata corresponding to the following geometric condition : three points are in a line . for the case of 6 points",
    "we get two additional types of strata : six points on a conic , and three lines passing through three pairs of points have a unique point of intersection .",
    "so the following are three codimension  1 strata ( appeared in  @xcite by n.  l.  white and w.  whiteley ) :    * three points in a line ; * the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 meet in one point ( or all parallel ) ; * all the six points are on a conic .",
    "we conclude this subsection with the following problems .",
    "find a description of @xmath81 and @xmath82 similar to the ones for @xmath69 and @xmath68 shown in the previous subsections .      in",
    "@xcite we have studied strata of the 7 and 8 point configurations .",
    "there are 4 distinct types of codimension 1 strata for 7 points and 17 types for 8 points .",
    "the 4 types of codimension 1 strata for 7 points are defined by the following geometric conditions :    * three points in a line ; * the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 meet in one point ( or all parallel ) ; * the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the intersection of the lines @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) have a common nonempty intersection ; * the six points @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath85 ( where @xmath85 is the intersection of the lines @xmath93 and @xmath87 ) are on a conic .    for the list of strata of 8 point configurations we refer to  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the geometric conditions of any codimension 1 stratum can be obtained by the following procedure .",
    "consider the points of configuration @xmath5 ; for each two pairs of points @xmath94 and @xmath95 of this configuration consider the point of intersection of the lines @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to a bigger configuration of points including @xmath5 and the above intersections , we denote it by @xmath98 .",
    "this operation can be iteratively applied infinitely many times , which results in a _",
    "universal set _ @xmath99",
    "any condition for a codimension  1 stratum is always as follows : _",
    "three certain points of @xmath100 are in a line _",
    "( for the details , see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the condition _ the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 meet in one point _ in terms of points of @xmath101 is as follows . _",
    "the points @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath102 are in a line_.    for simplicity reasons we omit discussions of cases where certain lines @xmath96 and @xmath97 are parallel , due to the fact that this situation is never generic for codimension 1 strata . in general one may think that if the lines @xmath96 and @xmath97 are parallel , then their intersection point is in the line at infinity in the projectivization of @xmath62 .",
    "[ conic ] at first glance , the condition _ six points are on a conic _ is of different nature .",
    "nevertheless , it is a relation on the points of the configuration in @xmath103 described by pascal s theorem : _ the intersections of the extended opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed in a conic lie on the pascal line . _",
    "see also example  [ conic2 ] below .",
    "describe all the possible different types of strata for 9 points .    how to calculate the number of different types of strata for @xmath3 points with arbitrary @xmath3 ?",
    "it is also interesting to have an answer for the following question : _ how many iterations @xmath104i.e .",
    ", find the minimal @xmath105 for @xmath106@xmath107 does one need to perform to describe all conditions for the codimension 1 strata of @xmath3-point configurations @xmath5 ? _",
    "which configurations of @xmath108 define the same geometric condition ?    this problem is a kind of question of finding generators and relations for the set of all conditions .",
    "let us show one type of such  relations  in the following example .",
    "[ conic2 ] consider the condition : six points @xmath109 are on a conic .",
    "this condition is described by configurations contained in @xmath103 via pascal s theorem :    the points @xmath110 are in a line for @xmath111    where @xmath112 is an arbitrary permutation of the set of six elements .",
    "so , there are 60 different configurations of @xmath103 defining the same geometric condition .",
    "we now look into subgraphs contained in a particular stratum and ask the basic question on the dimension of the fiber .    even graphs of very low connectivity admit non - zero tensegrities , for disconnected or one - connected graphs we may simply examine the connected or 2-connected components .",
    "also 2-connected graphs may be decomposed via the 2-sum , see  @xcite : consider graphs @xmath113 and @xmath114 , their configurations @xmath115 and @xmath116 admitting tensegrities with @xmath117 a cable in @xmath118 and @xmath119 a strut in @xmath120 .",
    "we form the _ 2-sum _ @xmath121 by identifying @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 with @xmath125 and removing the identified edge .",
    "we can inherit a configuration @xmath5 from @xmath115 and @xmath116 by fixing @xmath115 and properly dilating , rotating and translating @xmath116 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath126    since 2-sum decomposition is canonical , we can describe geometric conditions for 2-connected graphs by geometric conditions on their 3-blocks . for example",
    "the geometric condition for @xmath9 in figure  [ 2sumfig ] is that the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 meet in one point .      as we have already mentioned in gr3 , for any codimension 1 stratum there exists at least one subgraph of @xmath44 that generically does not admit tensegrities but at this stratum admits a one - dimensional family of tensegrities .",
    "let us show such subgraphs for the codimension one strata of @xmath76 and @xmath127 .    in the case of @xmath128 we have three strata of different geometrical nature .",
    "the first triangular subgraph ( figure  [ strata6 ] , left ) is related to the strata with three points in a line .",
    "the second ( figure  [ strata6 ] , middle ) corresponds to the strata whose three pairs of points generate lines passing through one point .",
    "the last one ( figure  [ strata6 ] , right ) corresponds to the configurations of six points on a conic .",
    "* @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are in a line ; * the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 meet in one point ; * the lines @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath84 ( where @xmath131 ) have a common point ; * the six points @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath85 ( where @xmath132 ) are on a conic .",
    "note that the example for three points in a line is actually the 2-sum of a triangle with two atoms , so the only way for a non - zero self stress on the edges is to have @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , the vertices of the triangle , in a line .    geometric conditions for the graphs with 8 and",
    "fewer vertices are given in  @xcite .",
    "several of those geometric conditions were described before in terms of bracket polynomials in  @xcite by n.  l.  white and w.  whiteley .",
    "we also refer to the paper  @xcite by e.  d.  bolker and h.  crapo for the relation of bipartite graphs with rectangular bar constructions .",
    "[ [ surgeries - on - subgraphs - that - change - geometric - conditions - in - a - predictable - way ] ] surgeries on subgraphs that change geometric conditions in a predictable way ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in this subsection we present several surgeries that allow to guess the geometric conditions for new strata ( characterized by certain subgraphs ) via other strata ( characterized by these graphs modified in a certain way ) .",
    "we call such modifications of graphs _ surgeries_.        [ proposition 1.9.]*(edge exchange ) * consider a graph @xmath9 and a subgraph @xmath136 , and let @xmath137 and @xmath138 be two edges of @xmath136 .",

    "there is a certain analogy of the first surgery to @xmath167 exchange in matroid theory ( see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite for the connections between matroids and rigidity theory ) , but it is not exactly the same .",
    "[ 3doperation ] consider a graph @xmath9 and frameworks @xmath12 , @xmath118 , and @xmath120 as follows : @xmath168 denote the plane @xmath169 by @xmath170 .",

    "now we explain how to map @xmath181 to @xmath182 .",

    "is canceled as well .",

    "the next goal in this approach is to continue to study the geometry of the strata .",
    "ideally _ one would like to find techniques that will give geometric conditions for a graph via its combinatorics_. this question seems to be a very hard open problem .",
    "the study of surgeries is the first step to solve it at least in codimension 1 .",
    "the surgeries introduced in this section were extremely useful for the study of 8 point configurations ( see in  @xcite ) .",
    "we think that it is not enough to know only these surgeries to find all the geometric conditions .",
    "this gives rise to another question .",
    "as far as we know there is no systematic study of strata for tensegrities in @xmath0 or higher dimensions : these cases are much more complicated than the planar case .",
    "at least the stratification of @xmath82 should have a description similar to that of @xmath69 , since 5 points in general position in @xmath0 admit a unique non - zero self stress .",
    "additionally one should examine the rigidity properties of subgraphs in a stratum .",
    "for @xmath186 we have 14 strata of full dimension . for 8 of them",
    "the convex hull is a triangle , in 5 of the strata the points are in convex position .",
    "a tensegrity for the convex position has 4 struts ( cables ) and two cables ( struts ) , while in the non - convex case there are three cables and three struts .",
    "all of these tensegrities are ( infinitesimally ) rigid and struts and cables may be exchanged without destroying rigidity .",
    "however , when viewed as graphs embedded in @xmath0 only half of them are rigid . for the convex case",
    ", there must be cables on the convex hull and two struts .",
    "in the non - convex case there must be a triangle of struts on the convex hull and three cables in the interior , termed a spider web by r.  connelly .",
    "none of these are proper forms in the sense of b.  grnbaum .",
    "they are minimally rigid , but in the convex case they have members intersecting in a vertex other than a vertex of the graph , in the non - convex case there is a vertex without a strut .",
    "b.  grnbaum in his lectures on lost mathematics  @xcite asks about the number of proper forms given @xmath3 struts . on 3 struts ,",
