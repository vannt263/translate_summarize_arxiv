    "isotope ratios derived from cno elements have significantly contributed to our understanding of the nuclear processing in stars and the ` chemical ' evolution of galaxies , since these elements are abundant and have stable ` primary ' and ` secondary ' nuclei . from a theoretical point of view ,  is the least controversial cno isotope ratio : 12  is a ` primary ' product of helium - burning , 13  is mainly a ` secondary ' product of hydrogen - burning with 12  as the seed nucleus .",
    "some primary 13  may also be synthesized during the third dredge up in stars of intermediate mass ( ` hot bottom burning ' ,  renzini & voli 1981 ) .",
    "there is evidence for high  ratios in the central regions of active star - forming galaxies with high luminosities in the far infrared ( for a summary , see henkel & mauersberger 1993 ) .",
    "first hints were obtained from distant mergers ( being ultraluminous in the infrared ) which were showing integrated @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) @xmath6=10 line intensity ratios @xmath320 ( aalto  1991 ; combes  1991 ; casoli  1992a , b ) .",
    "an interpretation in terms of an extended halo of weak @xmath0co and negligible @xmath7co emission is not supported by a comparison of filled - aperture with interferometric co data ( p.m. solomon , priv .",
    "the generally accepted explanation involves inflow of disk gas with high  ratios into the central region , possibly combined with a 12  enhancement caused by nucleosynthesis in massive stars .",
    "most direct evidence for high  ratios was obtained from recent studies of the central regions of the nearby starburst galaxies ngc253 and ngc4945 ; this is based on  line intensity ratios from a variety of molecular species ( henkel  1993 , 1994 ) .",
    "the estimated  abundance ratios , 40  50 , are larger than the value for the central region of the milky way , @xmath8 25 (  wilson & rood 1994 ) .    since two well studied extragalactic sources represent too small a sample for a comparison with the milky way , we have extended this list , including m82 ( ngc3034 ) and ic342 .",
    "these contain powerful far infrared sources in their central regions and show an impressive amount of strong molecular lines (  henkel  1986 , 1991 ) . from our experience with ngc253 , the best limits to the  abundance ratio are obtained from the @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) line intensity ratios .",
    "we observed cn not only toward m82 and ic342 but also toward the galactic center region ( see table [ tbl : cn - source ] ) , where the interstellar  ratio is known and where isotope ratios deduced from cn can thus be tested .",
    "observations of cn , hcn , , and hnc ( for frequencies , see tables [ tbl : cn - line ] and [ tbl : cn - iso ] ) were made toward the central regions of m82 and ic342 in june 1993 using the iram 30-m telescope ( baars  1987 ) on pico veleta , spain . between 86 and 113ghz",
    "the full width to half power beam size was 26   22 .",

    "the ` channel spacing ' ( @xmath8 90% of the ` channel resolution ' ) corresponds to a velocity separation of 1.5  for the  @xmath12=10 transition and 2.8  3.5  for the other lines .",
    "the spectra were obtained with a wobbling secondary mirror using a switch cycle of four seconds ( 2s on source , 2s off - source ) and a beam throw of 200  ",
    "240  in azimuth .",
    "the pointing accuracy , based on nearby continuum sources and the lineshape of the simultaneously measured ( 21 ) feature , was @xmath8 5or better .",
    "all data were calibrated by observing a cold load at liquid nitrogen temperature and a chopper wheel at ambient temperature .",
    "the receivers were tuned to a single sideband mode with an image sideband rejection of typically 7db .",
    "the image sideband rejection was determined with a signal generator , inducing lines at the signal and image sideband frequencies about one or two days prior to the start of the observations . during the observations line intensities",
    "were regularly monitored toward orion - kl and irc+10216 .",
    "these remained stable to within 10  15% of the values given by mauersberger  ( 1989 ) .",

    "the beamwidth was @xmath8 45 .",
    "the main - beam efficiency was @xmath10 = 0.70 .",

    "integrating over all hyperfine components , the cn data from the galactic center ( table [ tbl : cn - line ] ) show that @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) = 9  15 .",
    "based on data from a variety of sources and molecular species ( , , , nh@xmath23cho , ocs ; see wannier 1980 ; wilson & rood 1994 , and many references therein ) , there is strong evidence for an actual  ratio of 25 @xmath22 5 in the interstellar medium of the galactic center region .",
    "accounting for possible line saturation in the  profiles , line intensity and isotope ratios are therefore consistent .",
    "our cn data provide _ lower limits _ to the  isotope ratio and neither fractionation nor isotope selective photoionization play a dominant role .",
    "fractionation can be analysed in some more detail : the /  abundance ratio is affected by the reaction @xmath24 ( watson  1976 ) , which enhances  relative to  and @xmath0c@xmath25 relative to @xmath7c@xmath25 in the more diffuse  rich parts of molecular clouds . for  and , the corresponding difference in the energies of the ground vibrational states is @xmath8 32k . while reaction ( [ eqn : cn - reaction ] )",
    "has little effect on the /  abundance ratio , other carbon - bearing molecules like hcn , hnc , , and cn are affected in the sense that their abundance ratios follow  and are thus larger than the corresponding isotope ratio ( langer  1984 ; langer & graedel 1989 ) . with  and  bracketing the actual carbon isotope ratio ,",
    "observations show that these deviations must be small ( @xmath8 20  30% in the galactic disk ; cf .",

    ".  may be largest in the more active regions of ir - luminous galaxies (  mauersberger  1986 ; ho 1990 ; solomon  1992 ) and isotope selective cn fractionation should thus be negligible .",
    "our extragalactic cn data can be used to estimate  isotope ratios , ( 1 ) because the spectra from the galactic center region provide ` reasonable ' results ( see sect.[sec : cn - hyperfine ] ) and ( 2 ) because significant non - lte effects are not seen in the m82 and ic342 spectra .",
    "the @xmath16 line intensity ratios are close to the lte value ( see eq.([eqn : cn - r12 ] ) and table [ tbl : cn - depth ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the hc@xmath7ccn and hcc@xmath7cn features , observed in the galactic center  spectra ( fig.[fig : cn - gc ] ) , are not expected to disturb our extragalactic  profiles : hc@xmath26n is extremely weak in extragalactic sources (  henkel  1988 ; mauersberger  1990 ) . toward our extragalactic sources ,",
    "is thus likely optically thin and the @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) line intensity ratios of @xmath3 40 and @xmath3 30 for m82 and ic342 , respectively , can be interpreted as lower limits to the  isotope ratio .    in table",
    "[ tbl : cn - iso ] , lower limits to the  intensity ratio are displayed for a variety of molecular species toward m82 and ic342 . unlike the @xmath12=10 cn transitions , other observed molecular lines are not significantly broadened due to hyperfine splitting .",
    "the emission from the 13 -bearing isotopic species is probably optically thin , while the emission from the main species may be saturated .",
    "since the line intensity ratio of the common 12  to its rare 13 -bearing isotopic species will be reduced by optical depth and self - absorption effects ( this is not fully compensated by differences in excitation ; see henkel  1994 ) , the lower limit of the intensity ratio is also the lower limit to the  isotopic abundance ratio .",
    "combining our result with previous work done toward ngc253 and ngc4945 ( henkel  1993 , 1994 ) , a small  ratio as observed in our galactic center region appears not to be typical for galaxies with infrared luminosities similar to or higher than that of the nuclear region of the milky way .",
    "this result suggests ( casoli  1992b ) that ( 1 ) gas inflow from the outer regions adds large amounts of low - metallicity , 13 -poor material to the nuclear interstellar medium or that ( 2 ) 12  may be more efficiently produced ( relative to 13 ) in regions with a high rate of massive star formation .",
    "oh and  data indicate a  ratio of 250 @xmath22 30 for the galactic center region (  wilson & rood 1994 ) . combining , , and  data with our upper limits to the  ratio deduced in sect.[sec : cn - isoc ]",

    "we thus find  @xmath3 90 and @xmath3 125 for m82 and ic342 , respectively .",
    "the  abundance ratio ( 270 in our solar system and @xmath8 400 in the local interstellar medium ;  dahmen  1995 ) has so far not been measured in an extragalactic object . according to henkel & mauersberger ( 1993 )",
    ", such ratios may be small ( @xmath33 150 ) in nuclear starburst regions . combining  @xmath6=10 data from m82 with hcn (  )",

    "[ tbl : cn - iso ] a lower 3@xmath15 limit of 43 is obtained for the @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) ratio .",
    "estimating an  optical depth of @xmath8 3  4 ( henkel  1993 ) , a lower limit of 43 from the @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) intensity ratio implies that the  isotope ratio should exceed 100 .",
    "having studied the @xmath12=10 line profiles of  and  toward four galactic center clouds and a variety of molecular species toward the central region of m82 and ic342 , we obtain the following main results :    1 .   in the galactic center clouds , non - lte populations in the @xmath0cn @xmath12=0 doublet lead to enhanced line intensities for hyperfine transitions with @xmath12=0 , @xmath6,@xmath34=1/2,1/2 as lower state .",
    "alternative explanations for the lte deviations , either involving opaque @xmath35=1/2,1/21/2,1/2 lines or significant isotope selective fractionation are not attractive .",
    "no signs for line saturation or non - lte effects are found in the cn spectra from m82 and ic342 ; non - lte intensities in the  @xmath12=10 profile are only seen toward one galactic center cloud , m013008 .",
    "2 .   if line saturation affects the observed  features , @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( ) line intensity ratios should be smaller than the actual  abundance ratio , which is @xmath8 25 in the galactic center region . with @xmath2()/@xmath2 ( )",

    "since the  ratios have been found to be @xmath8 40 , @xmath8 50 , and 25 @xmath22 5 in ngc253 , ngc4945 , and the galactic center region , these results are consistent with large  ratios ( @xmath325 ) in the nuclear regions of starburst galaxies ( m82 , ngc253 , and ngc4945 ) .",
