    "over the last two decades spectroscopic and photometric observations of nearby early - type galaxies have shown that they obey tight scaling relations .",
    "for example more luminous galaxies are redder @xcite ; the strength of the mg - absorption ( at @xmath65175  ) increases with increasing central velocity dispersion @xcite ; and early - type galaxies populate only a band ( or ` plane ' ) in the three dimensional space of central velocity dispersion , effective radius , and mean effective surface brightness , the so called ` fundamental plane ' @xcite .",
    "the tightness of the scaling relations has traditionally been interpreted as evidence for a very homogeneous population of early - type galaxies , old stellar populations and similar dynamical make - up of the galaxies @xcite .",
    "for example the colour - magnitude relation is perhaps best explained by a correlation of the metal abundance of the stellar population and total galaxy mass with no age gradient along the sequence @xcite .",
    "however , evidence is being found that elliptical galaxies do generally have complicated dynamical structures ( decoupled cores ) and disturbed morphologies ( shells ) , suggesting an extended and complex assembly such as in a hierarchical merging picture ( cole et  al .",
    ". furthermore measurements of absorption line - strength indices together with evolutionary population synthesis models suggest that the mean age of the stellar populations in early - type galaxies span a wide range @xcite .",
    "there is a hint of a connection between the detailed morphology and the mean ages of the stellar populations as ellipticals with disky isophotes show on average younger ages @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the studies of cluster galaxies at modest look - back times of 3 - 5 gyr where an increased fraction of blue , late - type galaxies is found @xcite .",
    "probably this change is associated with the transformation of spiral galaxies into s0 types observed over the same interval @xcite .",
    "how can we reconcile the existence of tight scaling relations for present day early - type galaxies with the evidence of an extended galaxy assembly and star formation history ?",
    "an answer to this question rests largely on our understanding of the detailed physical processes which determine the spectral or photometric properties seen in scaling relations .",
    "broad band colours and line - strength indices of integrated stellar populations are sensitive to changes in both their age and metallicity .",
    "in fact it is possible to find many different combinations of ages and metallicities which produce similar overall photometric properties ( age - metallicity degeneracy , worthey 1994 ) . in order to explain tight scaling relations , despite the presence of a substantial diversity in the integrated stellar populations",
    ", it has been suggested that the ages and metallicities of integrated stellar populations ` conspire ' such that deviations from a given scaling relation due to age variations are balanced by an appropriate change in metallicity and vice versa ; an age - metallicity anti - correlation @xcite .",
    "for example , a re - analysis of the sample by trager et  al . appears to show that galaxies with a young stellar component are also more metal rich .",
    "recently , evidence for a negative age - metallicity correlation has also been found in other data sets @xcite and in literature compilations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) and kuntschner ( 2000 ) did not find strong evidence for the existence of an age - metallicity anti - correlation in their analysis of the fornax cluster . however , to date there is a lack of large , high quality samples with which it would be possible to probe the population of early - type galaxies as a whole .",
    "in this paper we seek to further our understanding of scaling relations such as mg@xmath0 .",
    "we investigate the spread in the mean ages and metallicities _ at a given mass _ but also probe the possibility of age and metallicity trends _ along _ the relations .",
    "we use established methods such as the analysis of the scatter @xcite in the mg@xmath0 relation and line - strength age / metallicity diagnostic diagrams , and take advantage of recent advances in stellar population modeling such as improved corrections for non - solar abundance ratios @xcite .",
    "we employ a homogeneous and high - quality subset of the data collected initially for the smac peculiar motion survey @xcite .",
    "the sample is not complete but includes galaxies drawn mostly from nearby clusters and groups with some galaxies from less dense environments .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the sample selection , observations , data reduction and the measurements of the line - strength indices .",
    "section  [ sec : mg_sig ] presents the mg@xmath0 and fe@xmath0 relations with an initial investigation into the scatter and slopes . in section  [ sec : age ] we present a detailed analysis of age - metallicity diagnostic diagrams including an improved treatment of non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "the effects of the non - solar abundance ratio corrections on the age - metallicity estimates and on the index@xmath0 relations are presented in sections  [ sec : imp_index ] and [ sec : imp_sig ] respectively .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the data reported here is from the smac i97ma spectroscopic run ( see smith et  al .",
    "2000 for further details ) .",
    "this run was undertaken principally to provide a secure connection of the smac data to other data sets and concentrated on observing galaxies with measurements previously reported by dressler ( 1984 ) , ( 1993 ) and davies et  al .",
    "accordingly the smac i97ma data shows a good overlap with the lick / ids system with 48 galaxies in common . in selecting targets ,",
    "higher priority was given to galaxies with measurements from multiple sources . while the sample is dominated by ellipticals in the virgo and coma clusters ,",
    "it does include a few s0s and galaxies in less dense environments ( see table  [ tab : table ] of the appendix ) .",
    "it is not a complete sample in any sense and our sensitivity to environmental effects is limited .",
    "however , we did not find strong differences between galaxies from different environments or morphologies in our sample and thus throughout this paper we do not split up our sample but treat it as a whole .",
    "the observations were carried out by jrl at the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( march 1997 ) .",
    "the intermediate dispersion spectrograph was used in conjunction with the 23.5 cm camera , the 900v grating and a tek1k chip . with a slit width of 3  arcsec , an instrumental resolution of @xmath7   fwhm",
    "was achieved , equivalent to an instrumental dispersion ( @xmath8 ) of 98  . the spectra cover a wavelength range of 1024   , sampled at 1   pix@xmath9 from 4800 to 5824   . in total 200 galaxy spectra",
    "were obtained including many repeat observations . along the slit the central five pixels of each observation",
    "were combined giving an effective aperture of @xmath10  arcsec@xmath11 . for other basic data reduction details and the velocity dispersion measurements",
    "see smith  et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    the wavelength range and the redshift distribution of our data allows the measurement of five important line - strength indices ( , mg@xmath12 , , fe5270 , fe5335 ) in the lick / ids system ( worthey 1994 , hereafter w94 , trager et  al .",
    "the indices were measured on the galaxy spectra after they had been corrected to a relative flux scale and were broadened to the lick / ids resolution and were measured from the un - broadened spectra . ]",
    "( see also worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) . the index measurements were then corrected for internal velocity broadening of the galaxies following the method outlined in kuntschner ( 2000 ) .",
    "the formal measurement errors were rescaled to ensure agreement with the error estimates derived from the repeat observations ( the scale factors ranged from 0.80 to 1.07 for all indices but mg@xmath12 with a scale factor of 0.44 ) . in order to maximize the s / n , multiple index measurements of the same galaxy were averaged giving a sample of 140 different galaxies .",
    "the effective s / n per   of these combined measurements ranges from 14 to 78 . in order to keep the errors of the index measurements reasonably low we decided to use only index measurements with an effective @xmath13 per   giving a final sample of 72 galaxies ( median s / n  @xmath14 per   ) which we will analyze in this paper .",
    "all of our data were obtained using the same physical aperture size , but since the galaxies span a factor of @xmath610 in distance , the spectra sample different physical aperture sizes in kpc . since line indices and velocity dispersion exhibit measurable gradients with respect to radius , it is necessary to correct these parameters to a ` standard ' aperture .",
    "here we adopt a generalisation of the aperture correction due to jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard ( 1995 ) , which scales parameters to a circular aperture of diameter 1.19 @xmath15  kpc , @xmath16 mpc@xmath9 , equivalent to a circular aperture of 3.4 arcsec at the distance of coma .",
    "the strength of the correction ( the correction in the quantity per dex in aperture size ) is @xmath17 for @xmath18 , mg@xmath12 and , but @xmath19 for and zero ( no correction ) for .",
    "these correction strengths are based on the average line strength gradients observed in early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the correction strengths adopted in this paper are overall similar to the ones used in jrgensen ( 1997 ) , however we use @xmath19 for the index , whereas jrgensen used @xmath20 .      in order to determine the systematic offsets between our line - strength system and the original lick / ids system ( on which the worthey 1994 model predictions are based ) , we compared index measurements for the 48 galaxies in common with the lick galaxy library @xcite .",
    "we note that the lick / ids aperture was @xmath21  arcsec ; so for the following comparison our data was corrected to the ( fixed ) lick / ids aperture using the formula given in jrgensen et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "generally there is good agreement between the two data sets and only small offsets are found ( see table  [ tab : lick_off ] and figure  [ fig : offset_all ] ) . in order to match the lick / ids system we removed the offsets from our data .",
    "the median measurement errors in the indices , for our sample galaxies , are given in column 4 of table  [ tab : lick_off ] .",
    "for a definition of non - standard line - strength indices see section  [ sec : special_indices ] .",
    "notes : the first column shows the name of the galaxy .",
    "if the galaxy is found in the ngc or ic ( nilson 1973 ) catalogues , then it will have the name from the corresponding catalogue , in the order of preference given above .",
    "there are also some galaxies denoted by their name from the cgcg ( zwicky et  al .",
    "1961 , zxxx - xx ) catalogue , dressler s ( 1980 , dxxx ) catalogue and one galaxy found in the godwin , metcalfe & peach catalogue ( 1983 , gmp  1652 ) .",

    "for smaller associations we just indicate whether the galaxies are in a very low density environment ( `` - '' ) or belong to a group .",

    "the velocity dispersion @xmath22 and the line - strength indices have been aperture corrected to @xmath23kpc , equivalent to 34 at the distance of the coma cluster .",
