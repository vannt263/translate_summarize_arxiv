    "the fate of metals released by massive stars in hii  regions where stars are forming is not yet settled .",
    "kunth &  sargent ( 1986 ) have suggested that the hii  gas can enrich itself with metals expelled by supernov  and stellar winds during the timescale of a starburst .",
    "however ionized regions in the lmc and smc present very little dispersion in their metal content while x - ray studies show that metals reach the halo of galaxies in a hot phase before they could cool down and finally mix within the ism in a few 10@xmath1yr . while hii  regions abundances derived from optical emission - lines",
    "are usually believed to be representative of the metallicity of extragalactic regions , the derived abundances would not necessarily reflect the actual abundances of the ism if hii  regions are self - polluted .",
    "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are prime targets for the study of their neutral gas using far - uv absorption lines .",
    "these galaxies are thought to be chemically unevolved and the outskirts of their neutral cloud could still be pristine .",
    "the fate of the newly  produced metals in these objects is not clear .",
    "a possibility is that , once released by massive stars they remain in a hot phase , being unobservable immediately through optical and uv emission lines ( tenorio - tagle  1996 ) . on the other hand , kunth & sargent ( 1986 ) suggested that heavy elements released by supernov  lead to a prompt self  enrichment of hii  regions in the timescale of a star ",

    "tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) and recchi  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) models differ in the delay between the release and the final mixing , which can reach several 10@xmath1  years ( gyr ) in the first case but only several 10@xmath2  years ( myr ) in the second .",

    "oxygen is either identical in both the ionized and neutral phases or deficient in the hi  gas .",
    "the overall picture brings a new view into the chemical evolution of the ism in a galaxy .",
    "however it is possible that these results suffer from many uncertainties such as ionization corrections , depletion effects or systematic errors due to both multiple sightlines and multiple hiiregions within the slit .    in this context ,",
    "nearby giant hii  regions provide a much simpler case since only one region falls into the aperture , reducing possible systematic errors .",
    "the study of ngc604 presented here is part of a larger project involving several nearby giant hii  regions .",

    "the _ fuse _ observations ( lwrs and mdrs apertures ) allow us to determine the chemical composition while the hst/_stis _ spectrum gives the possibility to map the neutral gas inhomogeneities and investigate possible multiple line of sight effects .",
    "data analysis has been performed using the profile fitting procedure ` owens ` developed at the institut dastrophysique de paris by martin lemoine and the _ fuse _ french team .",
    "this program returns most likely values of many free parameters such as heliocentric velocities , turbulent velocities , or column densities by a @xmath3 minimization of absorption lines profiles .",
    "errors on parameters include uncertainties on all the free parameters , in particular the position and shape of the continuum .",
    "we checked the shape of the adopted continuum by comparing the observed spectrum with a theoretical model of young stellar populations .",
    "no significant difference is found between the model and the continuum we adopted for the profile fitting .",
    "moreover , by comparing the data with the model , we find no significant contamination of neutral interstellar lines by stellar atmospheres .    by investigating the two _ fuse _ observations , we show that an additional broadening of the lines can account for the spatial distribution of the bright sources within the slit .",
    "the column densities we derive account for this extension . for the first time , we could check saturation effects for oi  and feii  lines by analyzing lines independently .",
    "we find no correlation between column densities derived from each line with the oscillator strength , implying that saturated oi  and feii  lines in those spectra do not give systematic errors .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the hst/_stis _ spectrum of ngc604 gives the possibility to extract spectra towards individual stars of the ionizing cluster ( bruhweiler et al .",
    "so far , we have analyzed three sightlines from which we have measured hi  column density using the lyman @xmath4 line .",
    "we find spatial variations ( up to 0.4 dex ) suggesting inhomogeneities of the diffuse neutral gas .",
    "this could be a source of systematic errors when determining global column densities from a spectrum of a whole cluster .",
    "we built the global spectrum ( i.e. the mean spectrum of all sightlines , weighted by star magnitudes ) of the hst/_stis _ observation to mimic the spectrum of a cluster in order to compare the real mean column density we want to determine with the weighted mean we actually measure .",
    "preliminary results show that we could tend to underestimate the actual column density when analyzing a global spectrum of several sightlines towards clouds having different physical properties .",
    "within errorbars , we derive similar column densities with the two _ fuse _ apertures ( see fig .  1 ) . by modelling the ionization structure of the hii  gas with the photoionization code ` cloudy ` , we find that ni  and oi  are good tracers of the neutral gas , contrary to ari , feii , and siii  which require ionization corrections to obtain final abundances shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we find that n , o , ar , and fe are underabundant by approximately the same factor  @xmath06 in the neutral phase of ngc604 . whatever the correct interpretation is , the fact that all specie are equally deficient as compared to that of the hii gas regardless their stellar origin ( primary or secondary ) is not in favor of the self - pollution explanation .",
    "these results could alternatively favor the presence of less chemically evolved gas pockets in the sightlines , which would tend to dilute the metallicity measured in front of the hii  region , or that dense clouds out of which hii  regions form could be more metallic than the diffuse ism ."
