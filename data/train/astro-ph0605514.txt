    "pulsar equation describes structure of electromagnetic fields and currents in magnetosphere of aligned rotator .",
    "the structure is uniquely determined by a scalar function @xmath0 which is a solution of the equation @xmath1 the @xmath0 and the unknown source function @xmath2 define structure of electromagnetic fields and currents in pulsar neighborhood .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the axis of rotation of the pulsar as the symmetry axis . to solve the equation we assume scharlemann & wagonerconditions which we specify later on .",
    "this however means , that we do not consider the particle production issue nor we make any tests for the shape of emitting regions . for simplicity",
    "we do not take into account return currents , however they can be incorporated by adding delta function in the source term .",
    "to describe structure of magnetosphere scharlemann & wagonerassumed in @xcite the following conditions    1 .   * axial symmetry and stationarity * [ axl:2 ] the assumptions follow naturally from the simplifying requirement that the axis of rotation of a neutron star overlaps with its dipole momentum ( aligned rotator ) .",
    "the axis is therefore the axis of cylindrical symmetry of the whole system and the system is independent of time .",
    "the model is a particular case of the oblique rotator ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the system does not generate the pulsar effect because there is no modulation .",
    "however , we consider the case of aligned rotator for simplicity .",
    "such issue is interesting , too , and it was discussed in many articles ( like @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "* force - free approximation * [ ff:4 ] in this approximation one assumes that inertial and gravitational forces are negligible , by which only electric and magnetic forces are taken into account .",
    "the assumption agrees with considerations of goldreich & julian @xcite who showed that the electromagnetic interaction are stronger than gravitational forces by a factor of @xmath6 for protons , and @xmath7 for electrons .",
    "they also found that charge density just above the neutron star surface can not be zero .",
    "one can imagine pulsar as extremely big atomic nucleus .",
    "* rigid co - rotation * [ rotation:5 ] although we are aware of the current works by timokhin ( @xcite @xcite ) who considers models with critical point located inside the light cylinder , we present our algorithm assuming that the point is located just on the cylinder as in scharlemann & wagonermodel . however , boundary conditions can always be adapted to account for timokhin assumptions .",
    "additionally , one may take into account return currents but we do not consider them in our short paper aimed at presenting our algorithm .",
    "* asymptotics * it is assumed that asymptotically @xmath0 tends to the profile of the split magnetic monopole of unit charge , while in the vicinity of the center a magnetic dipole should be located .",
    "the solution should be smooth everywhere apart from the equatorial plane outside the light cylinder .",
    "to find @xmath0 with scharlemann & wagonerconditions in the whole physical space we adapted pulsar equation as follows    1 .",
    "* compactification * is required to perform calculations on a finite size lattice .",
    "for example , one can choose the mapping @xmath8 that transforms the original infinite physical domain @xmath9\\times[-\\infty,+\\infty]$ ] onto the square @xmath10\\times[-2,2]$ ] .",
    "by symmetry it suffices to consider only the region @xmath11 . as an example in figure [ fig:1 ] there",
    "are shown profiles of the monopole and of the dipole in the compactified domain .",
    "* boundary conditions * [ bound:12 ] scharlemann & wagonerboundary conditions @xcite in the compactified domain are given in table below + [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the new method of calculating source function seems to work well . for bigger grids",
    "we do nt presume they would improve the results qualitatively .",
    "we can repeat our calculations with timokhin ( @xcite ) boundary conditions .",
