    "unstable density waves inside self - gravitating gaseous media play an important role in structuring of spiral galaxies and accretion discs .",
    "prior works in the literature deal with the instability of differentially rotating discs , which are initially circular .",

    "lemos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) studied the unstable axisymmetric modes of the more puzzling scale - free discs and solved the dispersion relation to determine the sufficient conditions for ring formation and for the existence of breathing modes . recently",
    "goodman & evans ( 1999 , hereafter ge ) constructed the normal modes of the scale - free mestel ( 1963 ) disc in the cowling approximation . for self - gravitating modes they computed the ratio of growth rate to pattern speed by solving a recurrence relation in the mellin - transform space .",
    "density waves in the presence of an external potential field , like that of a massive central object , have also been extensively studied using semi - analytical and finite difference techniques ( e.g. , papaloizou & lin 1989 ; savonije & heemskerk 1990 ; papaloizou & savonije 1991 ) .",
    "the assumption of axisymmetry of the equilibrium ( or initial ) state , however , imposes significant simplifications on the solution of dynamical equations .",
    "in fact , unstable modes of circular discs are decoupled because the only @xmath2-dependent term , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , is factored out of the linearized poisson and hydrodynamic equations .",
    "here @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath5 is the wave number .",
    "such a factorization is impossible if the unperturbed state is non - axisymmetric .",
    "azimuthal modes of perturbed non - axisymmetric discs can interact with the fourier components of the equilibrium state and result in more complex patterns .",
    "in this paper we attempt to formulate the instability problem of non - axisymmetric discs based on a perturbation theory , and present a mechanism for the generation of dense clumps through _ wave interaction _ in _ linear regime_. that occurs when a non - axisymmetric disc is destabilized .",
    "we apply our formulation to the simple discs of jalali & abolghasemi ( 2002 , hereafter ja ) , which reduce to mestel s disc in axisymmetric limit .",
    "we have chosen ja models as our unperturbed state because of two reasons .",
    "firstly , closed form ( exact ) expressions are available for physical quantities like the potential  density pair , pressure , sound speed and velocity components .",
    "secondly , both the potential and the surface density have a single fourier component .",
    "this minimizes the number of interacting terms in our subsequent analysis .",
    "we review steady - state , non - axisymmetric , scale - free discs of ja in section [ sec : non - axi - symmetric - discs ] and introduce a cutout function that helps us handle the singularity at the centre .",
    "we present a first - order perturbation theory for non - axisymmetric gaseous discs in section [ sec : perturbation - formulation ] , where we also introduce a basis set by which we expand the perturbed physical quantities .",
    "we then derive an eigenvalue problem for determining the normal modes of non - axisymmetric discs and discuss on the algorithms used for solving the resulting eigensystem .",
    "in sections [ sec::modes - of - circular - discs ] and [ sec : modes - nonaxi - discs ] , we study the unstable modes of circular and non - axisymmetric discs for the fundamental wave numbers @xmath6 , 1 and 2 , and discuss on the results and their physical implications in section [ sec : discussion ] .",

    "although the overall shape is a single armed spiral , which corresponds to the @xmath208 wave component of equation ( [ eq::perturbations - for - all ] ) , a number of dense clumps occur along the major spiral arm .",

    "the classical procedure in the instability analysis of gaseous ( and stellar ) discs is to start with an axisymmetric equilibrium and then perturb the governing equations in the vicinity of this equilibrium state .",
    "the subsequent eigenvalue problem [ e.g. , equation ( [ eq : axisymmetric - eigenvalue - equation ] ) ] results in a complex frequency @xmath216 , which implies an @xmath5-fold barred / spiral pattern @xmath217 $ ] that rotates by the angular velocity @xmath218 and exponentially grows by the rate @xmath61 . nevertheless , most events of physical significance happen in nonlinear regime when the modes begin to interact .",
    "in such a circumstance , more than one azimuthal wave component is present in the response spectrum .",
    "the most general form of a density wave in nonlinear regime is @xmath219 } , \\label{eq::general - density - wave}\\ ] ] which means that the amplitude and phase angle of @xmath68 are functions of all spatial and time variables .",
    "a primary result of ( [ eq::general - density - wave ] ) is the generation of dense clumps at the locations of the maxima of @xmath68 .",
    "clumps may undergo gravitational collapse , merge and give birth to gas giants .",
    "this is a widely accepted formation scenario of protoplanets ( e.g. , boss 1997 ; mayer et al . 2004 ) because it can take place in short time scales .",
    "asymmetries like the presence of a double star ( boss 2006 ) can also generate dense clumps .    according to ( [ eq::mode - nonaxi ] ) and calculations of  [ sec : modes - nonaxi - discs ] , unstable density waves of non - axisymmetric discs have a rich structure ( in linear regime ) even for very small non - axisymmetry parameter @xmath0 .",
    "although the temporal evolution of the @xmath5th mode is governed by the simple function @xmath220 , the eigenfunction associated with @xmath59 is by no means simple and it contains infinite number of azimuthal wave components , which in turn are capable of generating local clumps . since realistic accretion discs have",
    "not initially the _ nice _ axisymmetry feature , their instability can give birth to protoplanets sooner than what nonlinear hydrodynamical simulations predict .",
    "a protoplanet , as a possible product of the gravitational collapse of a dense clump , is separated from the rest of the evolving gas and migrates until it is captured by a resonant island in the phase space .",
    "our perturbation theory can be applied to any non - axisymmetric configuration regardless of the nature of the centre .",
    "cutouts , which are special treatments designed for scale - free models , are not needed in cored systems with finite total mass .",
    "the most important factor in success of our perturbation theory is the smallness of the non - axisymmetry parameter @xmath0 , which prohibits the interaction of azimuthal wave components in the zeroth order terms .",
    "our equilibrium density has a single azimuthal fourier component [ see equation ( [ eq : simple - disc ] ) ] .",
    "accordingly , the harmonic numbers of wave components differ in steps of @xmath221 ( @xmath222 ) . for bisymmetric discs studied in this paper",
    ", this means that wave components have only even or odd harmonic numbers .",
    "we will have the most complete spectrum if the equilibrium fields include fourier terms with both even and odd harmonic numbers , or if the disc is lopsided with @xmath223 .",
    "we presented three length scales to the perturbed equation ( [ eq::perturbations - for - all ] ) .",
    "the first two are the cutout radii , @xmath224 and @xmath48 , and the third one is the length scale of the basis functions , @xmath91 . at a first look , such a treatment of scale - free systems seems unfavorable because in this way we destroy their scale - invariance and cuspy features .",
    "however , with appropriate selection of the exponents of the cutout functions , @xmath49=@xmath50=2 , and the weight function of the velocity components , @xmath93 , the coefficient matrix @xmath94 of our eigenvalue problem became a function of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we easily decreased @xmath137 and noticed that unstable waves do not extend to distant regions although the mass of our equilibrium models ( with flat rotation curves ) is infinite at @xmath225 .",
    "we then let @xmath136 tend to zero with the aim of removing the inner cutout .",
    "this needed more terms of the series of associated legendre functions , but the qualitative features of our results remained unchanged as long as mode shapes and @xmath167 were concerned .",
    "there was an excellent match between our results and those of lemos et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who used logarithmic spirals to model their perturbed quantities .",
    "logarithmic spirals do not introduce any length scale to variational equations .",
    "the critical value of @xmath23 , below which our bisymmetric discs are stable , is a function of the fundamental wave number @xmath5 .",
    "numerical results show that the models with @xmath226 are stable for @xmath6 excitations when @xmath227 .",
    "this limit approximately becomes @xmath228 and @xmath229 for @xmath168 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the most interesting property that we have found for unstable non - axisymmetric discs is that the @xmath6 and @xmath168 modes can be stabilized by increasing the non - axisymmetry parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this happens for @xmath6 when @xmath194 and for @xmath168 when @xmath230 .",
    "there are some remarkable differences between the stabilized @xmath6 and @xmath168 modes .",
    "the stabilized @xmath6 mode has the form of a ring , which rotates according to the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5]_a_. it occurs when the wave components with the azimuthal harmonic numbers @xmath231 and @xmath232 cancel each other for @xmath121 .",
    "the stabilized @xmath168 mode , however , is a non - spiral , equiangular neutral mode .",
    "it emerges for a sufficiently large @xmath0 , when the wave component with the harmonic number @xmath233 ( @xmath234 ) cancels the fundamental component with @xmath235 ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath169 mode can not be stabilized by increasing @xmath0 , because the interacting wave components of @xmath236 have the harmonic numbers @xmath237 ( @xmath234 ) and @xmath238 ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "neither of these first - order components is capable of suppressing the effect of the fundamental component with the harmonic number @xmath240 . on the other hand , the wave component with the harmonic number @xmath241 is of @xmath242 , which is too weak to compensate the zeroth order @xmath169 component .",
    "based on the above reasonings , we speculate that the @xmath169 mode can be stabilized in discs whose surface density includes the fourth harmonic of the azimuthal angle or when @xmath243 in the simple discs of ja . furthermore , the unstable @xmath168 and @xmath169 modes of lopsided discs ( with @xmath223 ) can not be stabilized by increasing the non - axisymmetry parameter .",
