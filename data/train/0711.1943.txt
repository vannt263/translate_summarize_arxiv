    "evans , harris and pick @xcite found a necessary and sufficient condition such that holds for all functions @xmath6 on @xmath0 such that @xmath7 and such that the integral on the right hand side is finite .",
    "they consider even the case of non - symmetric hardy weights .",
    "however , due to the existence of harmonic functions with finite dirichlet integral , the hardy weights have to decay rather fast .",
    "this led naimark and solomyak @xcite to the study of for functions in @xmath8 ( and its closure with respect to the dirichlet integral ) . for regular trees ,",
    "see subsection [ prelim ] for the definition , they gave a complete characterization of the validity of on that class of functions .",
    "note that in both papers the condition @xmath7 was imposed .",
    "it is clear that without this assumption inequality can not hold for all metric trees . to see this",
    ", it suffices to consider @xmath9 as an example .",
    "our first remark in this paper is that if the tree is regular and grows sufficiently fast , then there are weights @xmath5 such that hold for all @xmath10 ( without the condition @xmath7 ) .",
    "following the approach in @xcite we can give a complete characterization of admissible weights and obtain two - sided estimates on the sharp constant @xmath11 in .",
    "as in the euclidean case , hardy weights typically decay like @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the growth of a tree is reflected by its branching function @xmath14 and our condition for the validity of is that the _ reduced height _ of @xmath0 is finite , i.e. , @xmath15 these trees are usually called _",
    "transient_. if @xmath0 has _ global dimension _ @xmath16 , that is , @xmath17 then holds iff @xmath18 .",
    "our second remark concerns tree with branching function growing faster than any power . as an example of this situation we study _ homogeneous trees _ ,",
    "i.e. , regular trees where all the edges have the same length and all the vertices have the same branching number . in this case , the laplacian is positive definite and one may ask whether is still true if we subtract @xmath19 times the bottom of the spectrum from the right hand side . we prove that this is indeed the case , and give again a complete characterization of all admissible weights . again the condition @xmath7 is _ not _ needed .",
    "our third remark in this paper points out another mechanism that induces a hardy inequality .",
    "this time we consider not a tree , but a halfline with a loop attached . clearly , for the laplacian on such a graph no hardy inequality is valid .",
    "we prove that an aharonov - bohm magnetic field with non - integer flux through the loop does give rise to a hardy inequality .",
    "this is reminiscent of the hardy inequality in the two - dimensional punctured plane with an aharonov - bohm magnetic field @xcite .    if @xmath20 grows as an exponential function at infinity , then @xmath21 and inequality becomes trivial .",

    "in this subsection we would like to recall some basic definitions about trees and fix our notation .",
    "we refer , e.g. , to @xcite for details .",
    "let @xmath0 be a rooted metric tree with root @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the unique distance between a point @xmath24 and the root @xmath1 and always assume that @xmath0 is of infinite _ height _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "the branching number @xmath26 of a vertex @xmath27 is defined as the number of edges emanating from @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the natural conditions that @xmath28 for any vertex @xmath29 and that @xmath30 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath0 is _ regular _ , i.e. , all the vertices of the same distance to the root have equal branching numbers and all the edges emanating from these vertices have equal length .",
    "let @xmath27 be a vertex such that there are @xmath31 vertices on the unique path between @xmath1 and @xmath27 including the endpoints .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the distance @xmath23 and by @xmath33 the branching number of @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , we put @xmath34 and @xmath35 . note that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are only well - defined for regular trees and that these numbers , in the regular case , uniquely determine the tree .",
    "let the ( first ) branching function @xmath20 be defined by , or equivalently , @xmath36 note that @xmath20 is a non - decreasing function and that @xmath37 coincides with the number of points @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "the rate of growth of @xmath20 reflects the rate of growth of the tree @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath20 measures how the surface of the ` ball ' @xmath40 grows with @xmath41 .",
    "we shall assume that this growth is fast enough in the sense that holds .",
    "such trees are called _ transient _ or of _ finite reduced height_.    the sobolev space @xmath42 consists of all continuous functions @xmath6 such that @xmath43 on each edge @xmath44 of @xmath0 and @xmath45 and the neumann laplacian @xmath46 in @xmath47 is defined through the quadratic form @xmath48 functions in its domain satisfy a neumann boundary condition at the root and kirchhoff matching conditions at the vertices @xmath29 .",
    "the operator domain of @xmath46 consists of all continuous functions @xmath49 such that @xmath50 , @xmath51 for each edge @xmath44 of @xmath0 and such that at each vertex @xmath29 of @xmath0 the matching conditions @xmath52 are satisfied . here",
    "@xmath53 denotes the restriction of @xmath49 on the edge terminating in @xmath27 and @xmath54 denote the restrictions of @xmath49 to the edges emanating from @xmath27 , see , e.g. , @xcite for details .",
    "we will state our main results in two different cases .",
    "in this situation we have @xmath56 see @xcite .",
    "our result then reads as follows .",
    "let @xmath57 and denote by @xmath58 the class of infinitely smooth functions on @xmath59 the support of which is a bounded subset of @xmath59 .",
    "we emphasize that functions in this class do not necessarily vanish at the root .",
    "we shall prove    [ hardy_mazya ] let @xmath0 be a regular metric tree of infinite height and finite reduced height , and let @xmath5 be a measurable , non - negative function on @xmath60 .",
    "then the hardy inequality @xmath61 is valid if and only if @xmath62 moreover , the sharp constant in satisfies @xmath63    it follows from that the closure of @xmath58 with respect to is a function space and that holds for all functions from this closure .",
    "in particular , it holds for all @xmath64 .",
    "let us give a simple    assume that @xmath0 has global dimension @xmath18 ( see ) .",
    "then one has @xmath65 and the decay exponent of the hardy weight can not be improved .",
    "it is easy to see ( and follows from the proof of theorem [ hardy_mazya ] ) that _ no _ non - trivial hardy inequality can hold on recurrent trees , i.e. , trees for which the integral in is infinite .",
    "this dichotomy is reminiscent of the euclidean situation , where a hardy inequality holds only in three and higher dimensions .",
    "another manifestation of this fact is the validity of a cwikel - lieb - rozenblum inequality for the number of negative eigenvalues of a schrdinger operator on a tree , see @xcite . on a recurrent tree",
    "a schrdinger operator has weakly coupled bound states , see @xcite .",
    "it is a consequence of ( with @xmath66 ) that the neumann laplacian @xmath46 is positive definite iff @xmath67 and that one has @xmath68 note that condition coincides with the corresponding condition for the dirichlet laplacian .",
    "this is a priori not clear since the spectrum need not be purely continuous .    in the positive definite case",
    "it is natural to ask whether the hardy inequality continues to hold if we normalize the right hand side such that its spectrum starts at zero .",
    "in other words , can one replace @xmath69 by @xmath70 ?",
    "we answer this question affirmatively for a special class of trees .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in this case the laplace operator is then positive definite .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the special class of trees with such property , namely the so - called _ homogeneous _ trees . recall that a regular tree @xmath0 is called _ homogeneous _ if all the edges have the same length and if all the vertices have the same branching number @xmath72 . by scaling we",
    "can assume without loss of generality that the edge length equals @xmath73 .",
    "the branching function has then the form @xmath74 a homogeneous tree clearly satisfies and .",
    "it turns out that the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath46 can be calculated explicitly ( see @xcite ) , namely , @xmath75    we shall prove    [ thm : hardy_homo ] let @xmath0 be a homogeneous metric tree with a branching number @xmath76 and edge length @xmath73 , and let @xmath5 be a measurable , non - negative function on @xmath60 .",
    "then the hardy inequality @xmath77 holds with some constant @xmath78 if and only if @xmath79    for two - sided estimates on the sharp constant @xmath78 in terms of we refer to the proof below . in analogy to we record @xmath80 for a homogeneous tree @xmath0 as in the previous theorem .",
