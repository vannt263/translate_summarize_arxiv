    "the beam broadening effect adds in quadrature with the manufactured passband , such that bands narrower than about 0.5%@xmath52 need wide - field compensation ( see @xmath354 ) in an f/3.3 beam .",

    "the order of interference , and  is the finesse ( the number of recombining beams to isolate a spectral element ) .",
    "the quantity  measures the separation of two successive orders of interference , divided by the instrumental profile fwhm .",
    "the spectroscopic resolution of the fabry - perot cavity is largely determined by the coating reflectivity of the two plates , but is often degraded by non - uniformities in plate@xmath34coating flatness , and the beam aperture . the measured ` effective ' finesse",
    "is given by @xmath75 where  is the reflective finesse determined by the coatings ,  is the beam - degraded aperture finesse , and  is the defect finesse due to irregularities in the plate mirrors .",
    "bland - hawthorn ( 1995 , fig .",
    "1 ) finds that , in order to minimize the impact of coating / plate defects ,  @xmath76 @xmath76 40 .",
    "after jacquinot ( 1954 ; 1960 ) , by considering the solid angle @xmath24 subtended by the innermost interference ring , we arrive at the important relation @xmath77 here , the peak intensity occurs at the origin and @xmath32 refers to the fwhm of the ring .",
    "it follows that the aperture ( or beam ) finesse is @xmath78 if  is dominated by either the beam or the reflective coating , @xmath79 for which @xmath80 returns the minimum of the two values .",
    "the ttf @xmath4 shared between the aat and wht @xmath4 has @xmath76 40 and @xmath81 , or equivalently , @xmath82 .",
    "the entire range is unobtainable in a beam faster than @xmath76 15 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "since the cassegrain foci of both telescopes is close to f/8 , to obtain the full scanning range of the ttf , it is used with the taurus-2 collimated beam . due to reflectance phase effects , the practical lower bound on  is higher than derived here ( jones & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) .",
    "these arise at low order spacings when the optical gap is less than or roughly equal to the coating thickness , at which point the effective optical gap is a complex property which depends on the details of the multilayer coatings .",
    "the net effect is that the lowest orders can not be achieved in practice .",
    "we now show that tunable lyot filters are optimal for achieving monochromatic wide fields at low resolving power .",
    "wide - field compensation ( or field expansion ) can be used to generate a strictly monochromatic field .",
    "the instrumental profile has much better wing suppression than the airy / lorentzian profile .",
    "low orders of interference can be achieved through the use of subtractive , rather than additive , paired birefringent elements .    there",
    "exist excellent discussions on the basic principles of the lyot filter ( lyot 1933 , 1944 ; evans 1949 ; beckers & dunn 1965 ; title & rosenberg 1979 , 1981 ) .",
    "these texts assume a proper understanding of how a wavefront propagates through a birefringent medium .",
    "there are many approaches to a complete mathematical treatment , including jones and stokes vectors , jones and mueller matrices , the poincar sphere and impulse response analysis ( longhurst 1990 ; hecht 1990 ) .    here ,",
    "we attempt an intuitive approach ; a rigorous treatment is given elsewhere ( bland - hawthorn & title 2001 ) . in order to arrive at the low - resolution filter proposed here , there are four key elements : ( a ) interference through birefringence , ( b ) wide - field compensation , ( c ) wavelength tuning , ( d ) retardance through differenced elements .",
    "the underlying principle of the lyot filter is that light originating in a single polarization state can be made to interfere with itself .",
    "the first element is a polarizer and forces unpolarized light into two orthogonal polarization components .",
    "if the polaroid is oriented at 45  to the fast and slow axes of a birefringent crystal , one component can be delayed with respect to the other .",
    "an exit polaroid , aligned with the entrance polaroid , recombines the orthogonal components to effect interference .",
    "crystalline materials are usually , but not exclusively , birefringent in that the refractive index is different along two axes within the crystal . in a positive uniaxial crystal ( quartz ) , the refractive index experienced by the ordinary ray on the ` fast ' axis , @xmath39 , is lower than for the extraordinary ray , @xmath84 , along the ` slow ' axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : biref ] ) .",
    "the birefringence @xmath85 leads to a time delay @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the speed of light in vacuo , and @xmath26 is the thickness of the element .",
    "retardance is expressed in angular units ,   @xmath88 .    for light traversing the simple system in fig .",
    "[ fig : montage](i ) , the transfer function is given by malthus law ( hecht 1990 ) , @xmath89 lyot ( 1933 ) realized that a cascading series of aligned birefringent units could be used to isolate a spectral element . from equation  [ eq : xfr ] , the easiest way to arrange",
    "this is to make each element twice the thickness of the preceding element ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lyotprof ] ) .",
    "the interleaved polaroids are essential to the rejection of out - of - band emission .",
    "the instrumental response is magnified in fig .",
    "[ fig : compprof ] .",
    "it is clear that the 5-stage lyot has much better wing suppression compared to the lorentzian response of the fabry - perot .",
    "the core of the profile is highly triangular and closely approximates the gaussian response .",
    "clearly , the free spectral range is determined by the thinnest element , and the spectral resolution by the thickest element .",
    "lyot ( 1944 ) demonstrates that the instrumental response of a series of @xmath90 elements is @xmath91 it follows that the free spectral range is @xmath92 , the finesse is @xmath93 , and the spectral element @xmath94 is the ratio of these two quantities .",
    "these quantities can be related directly to equivalent parameters for michelson and fabry - perot interferometers ( bland - hawthorn & cecil 1997 ) .",
    "low orders of interference are difficult to achieve at optical wavelengths .",
    "we have already mentioned peculiarities involving coated etalon cavities (  3 ) .",
    "now consider the problem involved in replacing the air - spaced cavity with a solid .",
    "this would require the manufacture of a micron - thick sliver of glass which was then polished to optical quality .",
    "this is easier to accomplish with birefringent materials simply because much thicker materials are needed to achieve a given time delay when compared to solid etalons .",
    "the resolving power of air - spaced fabry - perot plates a distance @xmath95 apart is @xmath96 , where  is the reflective finesse of the coated plates .",
    "this compares with @xmath97 , where  is now the lyot finesse .",
    "the lyot element with thickness @xmath95 determines the order separation ( fringe spacing ) .    for two commonly used materials , mgf@xmath98 and crystal quartz , @xmath99 , which means that , for the same resolving power , the thinnest element of the lyot is two orders of magnitude thicker than the equivalent plate spacing of the ttf .",
    "if our aim is to block neighbouring orders with conventional @xmath100 filters , the required ttf sub - micron spacings can not be achieved in practice , and are subject to reflectance phase effects (  3 ) . for the lyot , it is possible to optically bond sub - mm thick elements to a supporting substrate , or to use thicker retarding elements in a subtractive arrangement ( @xmath354.5 and fig .",
    "[ fig : montage](vi ) ) to achieve the same equivalent optical thickness .      in @xmath352 and @xmath353",
    ", it was shown that a narrow spectral band can not be isolated in a fast beam using interference or etalon filters .",
    "this is because the path length through the resonating cavity can not be equalized for all off - axis angles .",
    "remarkably , off - axis path lengths _ can _ be equalized with crossed birefringent elements ( lyot 1944 ; evans 1949 ) even for resolving powers as high as  @xmath101  @xmath102 ( title & rosenberg 1981 ) .",
    "wide - field compensation has been demonstrated to be extremely effective for narrowband imaging by several groups , particularly in the fields of remote sensing and solar astronomy ( beckers , dickson & joyce 1975 ; bonacinni  1989 ) .",
    "an intuitive explanation for why the method works is hard to come by . to begin , consider how wide - angle , zero - wave retarders are made .",
    "the retarder element in fig .",
    "[ fig : montage](i ) is split perpendicular to the propagation axis into two equal thickness elements .",
    "the pieces are then bonded together after rotating the fast axis of the second element to line up with the slow axis of the first element .",
    "there is no net retardance for any angle through the retarder .",
    "the principle of balancing fast and slow propagation is the primary method of wide - field compensation . in order to avoid the simple cancellation of the zero - wave retarder",
    ", a half - wave plate is placed between the split retarder elements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : montage](ii ) ) oriented at 45  to the fast and slow axes .",
    "why this works is somewhat involved : the most accessible discussion is given by title & rosenberg ( 1979 ) .",
    "the half - wave plate advances the phase of the @xmath103-ray by 180  ( see fig.[fig : halfwave ] ) with respect to the @xmath104-ray .",
    "this rotates the plane of polarization by 90  and re - aligns the @xmath103-ray with the fast axis of the second element .",
    "hence , the _ on - axis _ time delay of the crossed elements ( fig .  [ fig : montage](ii ) ) remains _ unchanged _ from the original system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montage](i ) )",
    ". it is the _ off - axis _ rays which benefit in two respects .    while the off - axis behaviour of interference filters is isotropic ( circular isochromes )",
    ", uniaxial crystals have a strong azimuthal dependence ( hyperbolic isochromes ) . for rays at an arbitrary azimuthal angle @xmath105 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : angles ] ) , the general form of the retardance is @xmath106 \\label{eq : retard}\\ ] ] note that the retardance changes sign between neighbouring quadrants , and this is the physical basis for wide - field compensation .",
    "remarkably , with the half - wave plate in place , the complex azimuthal behaviour all but disappears .",
    "light which enters the first split element from the direction @xmath107 enters the second element from the direction @xmath108 ) . from eq .",
    "[ eq : retard ] , the overall retardance is now @xmath109 \\label{eq : wide - field}\\ ] ] the equivalent form for the interference filter is ( eq .  [ eq : tilt ] ) @xmath110 \\label{eq : filters}\\ ] ] the monochromatic , solid acceptance angle available to a compensated birefringent filter is a factor of @xmath111 , orders of magnitude , larger than possible with an interference filter . moreover , lyot filters have a much greater @xmath112 product than available to interference filters and etalon filters ( eq .  [ eq : r - omega ] ) .",
    "title & rosenberg ( 1981 ) demonstrate several schemes for tuning a lyot filter . by far the best scheme involves a quarter - wave plate .",
    "the reader should consult evans ( 1949 ) for the most accessible explanation of how tuning works .",
    "the output of a given birefringent element is composed of equal amplitude rays along the fast and slow axes , with a relative phase shift which depends on the wavelength .",
    "the output can also be described as an elliptically polarized beam ,  two rays of unequal amplitude with a 90  phase shift between them .",
    "the ellipse is aligned with the entrance polarizer and the ellipticity depends on the wavelength .",
    "the trailing quarter wave plate removes the 90  phase shift and transforms the elliptically polarized light to linearly polarized light . the orientation @xmath113 ( and therefore wavelength ) is a function of the ellipticity @xmath70 such that @xmath114 where @xmath115 the tuning relationship for a single stage reduces to @xmath116 where the natural wavelength @xmath117 is selected at @xmath118 . in practice ,",
    "tuning is achieved by rotating the exit polarizer .",
    "the exit polarizer of one stage constitutes the entrance polarizer of the next stage .",
    "peak transmission is achieved as long as each successive stage is rotated precisely twice the rotation of the preceding thinner element . a gear system which maintains 2:1 synchrony between successive stages presents an interesting mechanical problem , particularly when anti - backlash gearing is incorporated ( beckers & dunn 1965 ) .",
    "the ( @xmath119 ) relation for the complete lyot system over the full optical range is more involved than equation  [ eq : psi ] ( beckers , dickson & joyce 1975 ) .",
    "conveniently , the sensitivity of the wavelength tuning to angular errors decreases for the thicker elements .    for the aat design ,",
    "we adopt a more convenient form of opto - mechanical control than conventional gearing ( beckers & dunn 1965 ) .",
    "each of the lyot stages is rotated independently and accurately with the use of circular encoders and separate motors .",
    "this has several advantages .",
    "no element needs to be rotated more than @xmath120 radians which reduces the heat input due to the fastest rotating elements in the conventional design .",
    "the gsfc lyot filter requires 400 rotations of the thickest element to tune over the full optical range ( palunas  2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , alignment errors between the lyot stages can be calibrated and compensated for .",
    "as each element rotates , it causes a cosine - squared modulation of the intensity at a single wavelength ( eq .",
    "[ eq : xfr ] ) .",
    "since each element produces its own distinctive modulation , it is straightforward to align the transmission maxima with a laser . moreover , each element can be calibrated separately for thermal variance in a temperature - controlled environment .",
    "if we connect each element to a separate temperature probe , simple temperature adjustment can be applied independently from a software table .",
    "* materials .",
    "* a wide - band lyot requires a uniform response in wavelength . in order of optimal birefringence ,",
    "the best substances are mgf@xmath98 , sapphire and crystal quartz ( serkowski 1974 ) .",
    "all of these produce roughly comparable retardances , @xmath121 .",
    "calcite has an order of magnitude higher birefringence with natural cleavage planes .",
    "however , it is brittle and difficult to handle in thin slices .",
    "sapphire is very hard and therefore requires diamond tooling and very long polishing times . at the other extreme ,",
    "linbo@xmath122 and kdp are hygroscopic and much too pliable .",
    "crystal quartz and mgf@xmath98 are hard , readily available and reasonable to work with .",
    "while quartz is the easier to work with , mgf@xmath98 has the most achromatic birefringence of optical crystals .",
    "but the lack of natural cleavages means that both materials must be cut and polished .",
    "since natural crystals are mined , it is hard to come by large pieces with high levels of purity .",
    "instead , most crystal elements are made from synthetically grown materials .",
    "the required crystal dimensions of 160  mm for mgf@xmath98 , sapphire and crystal quartz are mildly challenging for elements of sufficient purity , but not without precedent ( title 1999 ) .",

    "the polishing can be controlled to a thickness tolerance of 1% or better which is the required accuracy for our lyot filter design . after polishing",
    ", the element can be strengthened by leaving it bonded to the substrate .",
    "there are other approaches to the thin element problem .",
    "firstly , we could choose to make the thinner elements with a lower birefringence material ( composite lyot filter ) .",
    "second , to construct the zero - wave retarder in @xmath354.2 , a single element with @xmath125 was adapted to @xmath126 where @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , we can advance , retreat or cancel retardance along a given axis by a suitable choice of @xmath128 and @xmath129 . setting @xmath130 and @xmath131 , for example",
    ", provides equivalent retardance to a single element with @xmath132 , illustrated in fig .",
    "thus , thicker elements used together can be used to replace a single thin element .",
    "however , these may require wide - field compensation .",
    "* polaroid transmission . *",
    "polaroid filters are notoriously lossy with typical transmissions of 70% .",
    "however , thin film polarizers made by ` bleaching ' can have transmissions as high as 98% ( gunning & foschaar 1983 ) .",
    "a polymerizing sheet is placed in acetone to dissolve most of the plastic .",
    "the polarizing film is then stretched and deposited over a substrate in a humid oven .",
    "much of the art of bleaching resides in technical reports of the lockheed palo alto research laboratory where it was first developed by h.e .  ramsey . when achieving the highest transmissions through bleaching , it is important that the extinction ratio ( the ratio of the blocked and transmitted light ) be kept to 10@xmath133 or better .",
    "* wave plates . *",
    "the major technical challenge of the wide - field lyot filter is to produce achromatic half - wave and quarter - wave plates of sufficient size and quality ( serkowski 1974 ) .",
    "there are different levels of sophistication involving either one , two or three sandwiched plates of birefringent material .",
    "the degree of difficulty and cost increases dramatically with the number of elements .",
    "a single birefringent retarder can really only operate at a single wavelength since @xmath134 varies by 10% or more over the optical band ( serkowski 1974 ) . although a single retarder element with @xmath135 would be useable over at least 50  nm at .",
    "large monolithic elements can be made and are relatively inexpensive . in terms of wavelength invariance , mgf@xmath98 has almost ideal properties , but is harder to work with than crystal quartz .    a wave - plate with better achromatic behaviour combines two plates of different birefringent materials , in particular , quartz and mgf@xmath98 ( clarke 1967 ) .",
    "these plates were used in the zeiss universal filter ( beckers  1975 ) optimized for @xmath136 ( at ) over the range 450 - 700  nm .",
    "two - layer composite waveplates larger than 100  mm have been made but are costly and constitute a significant technical challenge . the best achromats exhibit variations in retardance of tens of degrees .",
    "the universal filter developed by lockheed solar observatory achieved @xmath137 ( at ) over a slightly broader response using waveplates comprising oriented sheets of polyvinyl alcohol ( title 1999 ) .",
    "these are polymer films stretched to align the long - chain , organic molecules much like cellophane .",
    "the polarization is produced by electrons within the lattice which experience different binding forces between the parallel and perpendicular directions .",
    "the advantage of cellophane is that arbitrarily large elements can be made although the transmission is not as good as conventional retarders .    a three - element retarder , the super - achromatic retarder ( pancharatnam 1955 ) , has excellent broadband properties , with variance in retardance of only a few degrees , but rarely exceed 50 mm in diameter and are very expensive to make .",
    "bigger retarders can be made by mosaicing smaller elements .",
    "for an aat lyot filter with a 30 - 40  field using commercial wave plates , this would require four elements to cover the field in the case of the achromat , and nine elements for the superachromat .",
    "this is a highly undesirable arrangement for an imaging system .",
    "the supporting structure typically has @xmath138 mm wide frames and it becomes difficult to accurately align the individual elements .",
    "this approach is more relevant to lyots placed at the pupil in a collimated beam ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nonuniform ] ) .",
    "an entirely new prospect is the possibility of sub - lambda gratings in transmission ( kikuta , ohira & iwata 1997 ) .",
    "these have the potential to yield close to 100% transmission over a broad spectral region .",
    "artificial optical anisotropy can be produced in a _ homogenous _ optical material when the surface of the material is covered with a regular grating whose period is smaller than the wavelength of light . the transmitted light will be delayed according to the orientation of the @xmath139 vector to the ruling . with recourse to effective medium theory ,",
    "the refractive indices can be expressed in terms of the groove depth @xmath26 and groove frequency @xmath90 , @xmath140 the indices @xmath141 and @xmath142 are for the grating ridges and grooves respectively . at a wavelength of 1@xmath143 m , a line width of 250  nm and groove depth of 800  nm could be made to operate like a conventional achromat .",
    "these lines are cut with either holography or e - beam lithography combined with reactive ion etching .",
    "the advantage here is that much larger elements are possible and the grating can be much thinner in the direction of the optical axis compared to commercial achromats .",

    "the modified doublet is expected to have a throughput close to 90% over the optical range .",

    "we calculate an overall system throughput of 32% to unpolarized light ( @xmath52750  nm ) with the wfi mosaic ccd , comparable to the existing ttf system ( jones 1999 ) .",
    "* image quality . * to ensure the quality of the optical wavefront , the retarder elements are polished to @xmath146 per inch .",
    "the flatness criterion is an rms average over the element area and is straightforward to achieve with modern polishing techniques .",
    "this assumes there are no high frequency ripples and that the material optical homogeneity is at least several parts per 10@xmath147 or better .",
    "the universal birefringent filter ( beckers  1975 ) has 58 precision crystal elements and polarizers in series , within an optical system comprising four compound lenses , four prisms , a fresnel rhomb , a thin - film filter , two external polarizers , two mica waveplates , and two kd@xmath148p modulators .",
    "( this is three times the number of elements for the low order lyot system discussed here . )",
    "smartt ( 1979 ) used a point diffraction interferometer to demonstrate that both the on- and off - axis performance give good wavefront uniformity .",
    "* spectroscopic integrity . * in order to achieve the theoretical bandpass , the faces of the retarder element must be parallel .",
    "each crystal element of the lyot acts as a two - beam interferometer . however , the manufacturing tolerances are much less stringent than for the michelson interferometer",
    ". if the shift in central wavelength is to be no more than a fraction @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) of a resolution element , the crystal faces must be parallel to @xmath151 in other words , the criterion is set by the time delay rather than the physical or optical path length . for crystal quartz , magnesium fluoride and sapphire , assuming @xmath152 , this amounts to no more than @xmath153 . in practice , this is somewhat stringent although this is probably a worthwhile target to counteract the cumulative effect of 5 elements in series .",
    "indeed , the requirement of good image quality ( see above ) already assures the spectroscopic integrity of the lyot profile .    *",
    "scattered light . *",
    "the quoted transmissions assume sol - gel @xmath34 mgf@xmath98 coatings on all external surfaces . the mean anti - reflectivity is better than 99% over the optical window 380  nm to 1600  nm . while the sol - gel layer is porous , after a simple ddms treatment , it repels moisture very effectively ( stilburn 1999 ; thomas 1999 ) .",
    "since the coatings are external to the polarizers , the polarizability of the coating layers has negligible impact on the lyot operation ( see @xmath35 5 ) .    to avoid internal scatter , all elements of the lyot are immersed in index matched oil .",
    "if the molecular chains are too long , the higher mean molecular weight tends to produce higher viscosity .",
    "if the chains are too small , the oil has the tendency to produce heat through turbulence .",
    "dow corning and mobil manufacture synthetic lubricants ( silicone oil ) with chain lengths designed to encourage a smooth flow , dow corning silicone oil 702 with a refractive index , @xmath154 .",
    "the oil must have low viscosity to avoid thermal input from the mechanical tuning , or the temperature of the lyot chamber must be actively controlled ( steel , smartt & giovanelli 1961 ) . for quartz ,",
    "the shift is @xmath40.5  k@xmath155 in the visible . a full discussion of thermal influence on the phase constancy is given by lyot ( 1944 ) .",

    "the gunn filters incorporate multilayer dielectric coatings in order to achieve the fast cut - off to low energies .",
    "but the broadband filters are external to the first polaroid and therefore do not affect the performance of the lyot filter .",

    "the aat has ritchey - chrtien optics with a hyperboloidal primary mirror .",

    "the objective grism bypasses this problem but at the expense of serious astigmatism across the field .",
    "the tunable lyot filter offers a powerful method for exploiting the full area of a large ccd mosaic .",
    "traditionally , lyot filters have been used in day - time astronomy , in atmospheric studies and in remote sensing .",
    "while half the light is lost at the first polarizing element , this is largely compensated for by the simpler optical system .",
    "the 5-stage , wide - field lyot proposed here has only 6 air - glass surfaces compared with @xmath10120 for the taurus-2 system ( taylor & atherton 1980 ) . with recent improvements in producing birefringent elements , polaroids and wave plates",
    ", the overall throughout will certainly compete with pre - existing imaging systems , but with the advantage of much greater survey efficiency .",
    "the construction and operation of a lyot filter is moderately challenging .",
    "the primary obstacles are the production of high quality achromatic polarizers , retarder elements , and wave plates , in order of increasing complexity .",
    "the lyot filter is tuned optomechanically which is a major advantage once the system is fully calibrated ( temperature ) .",
    "for very large lyot apertures ( @xmath180100 mm ) , the wave plate problem may need to be handled in stages .",
    "the prototype could use simple retarder elements which gives only about 50  nm of useful spectral coverage .",
    "later devices could incorporate achromatic or superachromactic retarders .",
    "the lyot filter is not the last word in wide - field tunable imaging .",
    "solc filters are highly non - intuitive tunable filters which use only two polarizers and a chain of identical retarders with varying position angles ( solc 1959 ; evans 1958 ) .",
    "there are many variants on the solc principle , the same can be achieved with polarizing filters by proper choice of crystal lengths .",
    "there are folded ( zigzag ) and fanned designs with the former having the better performance ( beckers & dunn 1965 ) . title ( 1999 )",
    "has made a tunable solc filter with 70  mm clear aperture .",
    "it has the extraordinary capability of an adaptable spectral profile : an @xmath181-element solc filter can have a profile that is determined by @xmath181 fourier coefficients .",
    "to our knowledge , a wide - angle solc filter using half - wave plates has not been attempted although it is entirely feasible .",
