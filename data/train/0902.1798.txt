    "it has proven notoriously difficult to connect the inflationary universe paradigm @xcite with fundamental particle physics . however , due to the recent advances in our understandings of flux compactifications , moduli stabilization and various compactification effects @xcite , string theory is beginning to provide relatively concrete settings for inflationary model building  @xcite .",

    "a particularly well understood example of the eta problem occurs in brane inflation , @xcite , where the inflaton is a ( slow - roll canonical ) scalar field @xmath12 parameterizing the position @xmath13 of a d3-brane moving towards an anti - d3-brane in a warped throat region of a calabi - yau flux compactification . here",

    "a major difficulty in inflationary model building in the above setting is the upper bound on the inflaton field range @xcite : [ bmbound ] , where this particular expression for the bound was derived by baumann and mcallister ( bm bound ) in @xcite .    for the purpose of this demonstration",
    ", we consider the so - called _ delicate model _ of slow - roll brane inflation @xcite .",

    "after sufficient tuning of parameters , it is possible to construct a viable slow - roll inflationary model .",
    "we consider this particular form for the potential because inflection point potentials are a common feature of many string inflation models @xcite , although our results are applicable to more general potentials .    our strategy will be to numerically construct a successful model of slow - roll brane inflation using the above set - up .",
    "we then demonstrate that this inflationary solution is lost if we include the effects of a particular dimension - six planck suppressed operator correction term @xmath46 of the form ( [ slowk ] ) .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that inflation can be salvaged if one appropriately takes into account the dbi nature of the inflaton kinetic term .",

    "multiple sources can ultimately contribute to hubble mass correction terms of the form @xmath18 .",
    "we devote this section to a rudimentary discussion of this potentially confusing topic . in effective field theory ( eft ) ,",
    "one expects a gravitational coupling term , @xmath48 , to appear in the scalar action due to the nature of quantum fields in a curved spacetime .",
    "the term is renormalizable by power counting arguments and therefore must be included in the curved spacetime scalar field lagrangian .",
    "even if it is not present in the bare lagrangian it will be generated by quantum effects : minimal coupling ( @xmath49 ) is non - generic and unstable to quantum corrections .",
    "moreover , the term has been explicitly calculated in the case of a dp - brane probe in a negatively curved einstein space with conformal boundary with a curved boundary metric ( such as asymptotically @xmath50 )  @xcite . in this case , the case relevant for brane anti - brane inflation , @xmath51 has the conformal value @xmath52 .    during inflation ,",
    "the hubble parameter is essentially constant ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the ricci scalar in a cosmological background is @xmath54 so that the conformal coupling term [ conft ] r ^2 h^2 ^2 , strongly resembles the hubble scale mass term in ( [ potef ] ) . due to this similarity",
    "the source of the mass term was conjectured to be the conformally coupled scalar in the brane anti - brane inflationary model of  @xcite",
    ". however , this was not explicitly derived .",
    "all that was derived was the pure mass term @xmath18 , analogous to the famed supergravity ( sugra ) , dimension - six operator mass term , @xmath55 , that results from expanding an f - term potential and using the einstein equations in an friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background to identify @xmath56 with the hubble parameter during inflation @xmath57 .",
    "an important point , is that the sugra mass term is present _ independently from the conformal term ( [ conft ] ) .",
    "we thank andrei linde for discussions of these points . ] .",
    "_    besides the conformal term ( [ conft ] ) , the mass term from the sugra analysis @xcite and the terms arising due to moduli - stabilization effects @xcite there are other possible eft sources of problematic mass terms , for example , finite temperature effects .",
    "typically , finite temperature corrections to the one - loop effective inflaton potential in the high temperature limit give rise to a temperature dependent mass term of the form @xcite : [ ttime ] v^t = c t^2 ^2 . gibbons and hawking used the path - integral approach to quantum field theory to prove that green s functions in de sitter spacetime are periodic in imaginary time and yield the hawking temperature @xcite : [ dstemp ] t_ds = .",
    "each observer in de sitter space has an event horizon , which radiates a thermal spectrum of particles at the temperature ( [ dstemp ] ) . combining ( [ ttime ] ) with ( [ dstemp ] )",
    "yields a finite temperature effective mass term correction @xmath58 .",
    "finally , we mention that it is perfectly consistent to include mass terms from both the non - minimally coupled scalar and various other contributions mentioned above .",
    "an interesting example , where the non - minimal coupling term appears in addition to an explicit @xmath18 mass term is in the calculation of the hubble effective potential at one loop in  @xcite .    ultimately , the origin of problematic mass terms in ( [ potef ] ) is not important for our results pertaining to a successful inflationary trajectory .",
    "although in general there are important distinctions between pure mass terms and the conformal coupling term . for specificity , we consider a contribution from the non - minimally coupled inflaton field parameterizing the d3 brane position as in @xcite .",
    "the 4d effective action is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the scalar - tensor action composed of the einstein - hilbert action plus non - minimally coupled scalar mass term [ actst ] s_st = d^4 x \\ { r - r ^2 } , and @xmath61 is the ( slow - roll limit ) canonically normalized inflaton kinetic term plus potential @xmath62 . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the conformal value @xmath63 and the @xmath64 case corresponding to minimal coupling .",

    "the situation changes dramatically , however , if we include the effects of the conformal ( @xmath82 ) coupling term in ( [ actst ] ) . before discussing the altered solution ,",
    "let us take a moment to ascertain some of the general consequences of including the @xmath51-term .",
    "first , the mass term introduces an effective planck mass : m_eff^2 ^2 - ^2 . for a sensical gravitational theory we demand this remain positive , @xmath83 @xcite . for the case",
    "@xmath84 , this introduces an effective uv cutoff for the theory , at the critical value [ cbound ] = .",
    "thus , the introduction of the @xmath51-term can destroy large field models of inflation in general .",
    "this cutoff exists independently from the field range bound ( [ bmbound ] ) .",
    "in fact , the bound ( [ cbound ] ) is more general than the bm bound which holds only in the specific instance of the warped throat brane inflation scenario . in a typical setting , @xmath85 , so that the bm bound , if applicable , is the more restrictive of the two . finally , we mention this cutoff will have strong implications for models of inflation where @xmath1 is growing , and hence , approaching the critical value .",
    "such is the case in infra - red ( ir ) models of brane inflation  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we can think of the conformal coupling term as generating an effective potential ( see ( [ nreomp ] ) ) : [ veff ] v_eff ( ) = ( 2 h^2 + h ) + v , effectively steepening the potential , decreasing the possibility for slow - roll inflation .",
    "this effect has noteworthy implications for the existence of eternal inflation @xcite in the brane anti - brane model of  @xcite , or other models with very flat potentials .",
    "regions of the universe where eternal inflation can occur have an indefinitely large and growing volume , making these regions statistically favored  @xcite . for inflating solutions with very flat potentials , @xmath86 , ( [ nreomp ] )",
    "implies the conformal term generates a new downward force @xmath87 typically decreasing the number of favorable regions where eternal inflation can occur .    in the numerical analysis plotted in fig .",
    "[ etap.eps ] we see that including the conformally coupled scalar allows for only @xmath88 e  foldings of inflation ( although there may be an interesting possibility of rapid - roll inflation at sufficiently low inflationary scales , see @xcite ) .    using the same compactification data and initial conditions as above",
    ", we now appropriately take into account the non - standard dbi form of the kinetic term for the inflaton field .",
    "thus , the entire action for the system is ( [ actst ] ) added to [ dbigrav ] = - , and potential ( [ inpot ] ) .",
    "variation with respect to the metric @xmath89 leads to : ( m_pl^2 - ^2 ) g _ = - ( _ _ ( ^2 ) - _ ^(^2 ) g _ ) + ( f^-1 ( ) - v ( ) ) g _ .",

    "foldings of relativistic dbi inflation , circumventing the eta problem ( fig .",
    "[ dbi.eps ] ) . while this result is not entirely unexpected it has not yet explicitly been shown in the literature in the context of a conformally coupled inflaton .    .",
    "@xmath91 e  foldings are achieved.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "as we have already mentioned , it is not our goal to fit the above model to the latest observational data , but rather to present a solution that avoids the eta problem and successfully produces more than 60 e ",
    "foldings of inflation while simultaneously satisfying all known compactification bounds .",
    "however , despite our current modest goals , it is interesting to understand in generality the possible effects of gravitational couplings in theories with nonstandard kinetic terms on cosmological observables and we initiate this study here .    in this section we show that the presence of a non - minmally coupled inflaton field in a dbi action changes the overall behavior of the sound speed in the model . in principle",
    ", this can lead to significant observational effects , for example , in the form of non - gaussianities in the cmb , allowing for possible observational distinction between pure dbi and dbi with non - minimally coupled inflaton .    to calculate the observable quantities from the action ( [ actst ] ) coupled to ( [ dbigrav ] )",
    "we first perform the weyl rescaling : [ ctrans ] g _ = ^2 ( ) g _ , where @xmath92 is the scaling factor given in terms of the inflaton as ^2 = 1 - .    under the transformation",
    "the action ( [ dbigrav ] ) becomes [ actp ] s = d^4 x ( r + p(x , ) ) , where @xmath93 . the functional form for @xmath94",
    "is given by : [ xip ] ( 1- ) ^2 p(,x ) = 6 ^2 x & & + - f^-1 ( ) & + & f^-1 ( ) - v ( ) .",
    "we denote this frame as the _ p - frame .",
    "note that this _ is not the traditional einstein frame , since in the low energy limit the action for @xmath1 does not reduce to that of a cannonically normalized scalar field as it does in the special case where @xmath94 is that of ordinary dbi inflation .",
    "we now calculate the physical observables directly in the @xmath94 frame @xcite .",
    "the theory of perturbations for actions of the form ( [ actp ] ) was carried out in @xcite .",
    "we will follow the study of primordial scalar non - gaussiantities in @xcite . _ _    the inflaton energy is given by : e = 2 x p_,x - p , and quantities of measurable interest are conveniently written in terms of the generalized slow - roll parameters : & = & - = , + & = & , + s & = & , where @xmath95 is the sound speed : c_s^2 = = , which is most conveniently calculated in terms of the rescaled warp factor : f ( ) f ( ) ( 1 - ) .",
    "the result for our @xmath96 ( [ xip ] ) is : [ cseq ] c_s^2 = .    in the limit of non - minimal coupling , @xmath49 , ( [ cseq ] )",
    "reduces to the standard result for dbi inflation : [ dbics ] c_s , dbi^2 = 1 - f ^2 .",
    "however , for the case under consideration , the results are slightly modified by the scalar - gravitational coupling term , allowing , at least in principle , for observationally distinct signatures .",
    "the observable quantities of interest include , the primordial power spectrum : p^_k = , the tensor perturbation spectrum : p^h_k = , and their respective spectral indices @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in this paper , we choose to focus on observational signatures in the form of deviations from gaussianity of the cmb .",
    "non - gaussianities are sensitive to the three point correlation function of the fourier transform of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation @xmath99 @xcite . a useful way to quantify the level of non - gaussianity in a given model is in terms of the scalar quantity , @xmath100 , given by = _",

    ". single field , slow - roll models generically predict undetectable levels of non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "this precise form for @xmath100 is valid for the _ local form of non - gaussianity . for the @xmath94-frame action ( [ actp ] ) : [ fnl ] f_nl = ( 1 - + 2 ) - ( 1- ) , where . for the case of pure dbi , with sound speed ( [ dbics ] ) , the first term in ( [ fnl ] ) vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of dbi plus non - minimally coupled scalar this is no longer the case ( the second term is also altered with respect to the pure dbi form via the sound speed modification ) .",
    "the overall change in the sound speed due to the presence of the non - minimal coupling term opens up the possibility that non - gaussianity and other observables listed above may be used to probe gravitational couplings of the form ( [ conft ] ) ( or other such terms ) .",
    "while we have focused on the dbi case above , we expect similar behavior in any model that contributes measurable non - gaussianities such as the k - inflation models of  @xcite . _",
    "in this paper we have explicitly demonstrated the ability of the dbi mechanism to circumvent the eta problem in a class of string inflation models .",
    "we have worked within the context of a non - minimally coupled inflaton field , however , our results apply to more general situations of pure hubble mass corrections to the inflaton potential .",
    "sources of hubble mass corrections , both in the context of effective field theory and in the context of string theory were discussed in section [ sec : pmt ] .",
    "dbi inflation models typically face a particular challenge due to backreaction effects and we have nothing new to add to this discussion here  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sound speed in the above solution grows very small rapidly and produces large non - gaussianity in excess of current observational bounds .",
    "nevertheless , our goal was to obtain an inflationary solution that makes progress towards realizing inflation even with hubble mass inflaton . in the present context it is possible to construct tuned inflaton trajectories that are initially slow - roll and fall into the dbi regime only towards the end of inflation . because of this , @xmath100 can become large after the cmb scales set in .",
    "this leaves the possibility of a model gaining the majority of e  foldings from standard slow - roll and the rest from dbi with detectable , yet observationally acceptable , levels of non - gaussianity .",
    "we have not determined wether such solutions are compatible with the stringy compactification constraints of  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have pointed out that , because adding a non - minimally coupled scalar to the dbi or k - inflation actions changes the formula for the speed of sound ( and observable quantities ) , gravitational couplings can contribute potentially observable signatures in the cmb . we leave a more detailed analysis of this interesting possibility for future work @xcite .",

    "<S> the eta problem is one of the most significant obstacles to building a successful inflationary model in string theory . </S>",
    "<S> planck mass suppressed corrections to the inflaton potential generally lead to inflaton masses of order the hubble scale and generate contributions of order unity to the @xmath0 slow roll parameter rendering prolonged slow roll inflation impossible . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the severity of this problem in the context of brane anti - brane inflation in a warped throat of a calabi - yau flux compactification with all phenomenologically dangerous moduli stabilized . using numerical solutions </S>",
    "<S> we show that the eta problem can be avoided in scenarios where the inflaton is non - minimally coupled to gravity and has dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the resulting cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observables such as measures of non - gaussianites can , in principle , serve as a probe of scalar - gravity couplings . </S>"
