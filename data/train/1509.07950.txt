    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems are widely regarded as a disruptive technology for next - generation ( i.e. , 5 g ) communication systems @xcite . by equipping a base station ( bs ) with an unprecedented number of antennas ( a few hundreds or a thousand ) in a centralized @xcite or distributed @xcite fashion , such a system can reduce cell interference substantially through the simplest signal processing method because the channel vector between the users and the bs becomes quasi - orthogonal .    however , a large number of antennas significantly complicate the design of hardware for the implementation of massive mimo in _",
    "production_. in particular , such systems require an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) unit for each receiver antenna ; therefore , using many antennas results in a need for an equivalent number of adcs .",
    "the exponential increase in cost and power consumption attributed to high - speed and high - resolution adcs bits typically adopt a flash architecture where the input voltage is compared with each of the @xmath0 tap voltages simultaneously @xcite . ] is a major bottleneck in deploying massive mimo systems @xcite .",
    "a solution to this problem involves using a very low - resolution adc ( e.g. , 13 bit ) unit at each radio frequency chain @xcite .    *",
    "previous work * : low - resolution adcs have favorable properties such as reduced circuit complexity , low power consumption , and feasible implementability .",
    "however , these converters inevitably deteriorate performance and complicate receiver design .",
    "the effect of low - resolution adcs on channel capacity has been studied for single - input single - output ( siso ) channels @xcite and , recently , mimo channels @xcite . through a single antenna with 1-bit quantization at the receiver",
    ", channel capacity can be achieved by qpsk signaling @xcite . in 1-bit mimo cases ,",
    "however , high - order constellations can be used to generate rates higher than those produced with qpsk signaling @xcite .",
    "in addition to information - theoretical studies , other works related to estimation / detection based on low - resolution samples include time / frequency synchronization @xcite , channel estimation @xcite , data detection @xcite , and related performance analysis @xcite .",
    "the strongly nonlinear characteristic of the quantization process complicates the precise estimate of continuous variables .",
    "for example , a very long training sequence ( requiring over 50 times the number of users ) is necessary to achieve the same performance as the perfect csi case in a mimo system with 1-bit adcs @xcite .",
    "such pilot overhead can not be sustained by a practical system ; to reduce pilot cost , a joint channel - and - data estimation method that used predicated payload data to aid channel estimation was proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , this technique enhances the computational complexity of the receiver .",
    "other practical issues , such as automatic gain control ( agc ) and time / frequency synchronization , have not been thoroughly examined in receivers with the pure low - resolution adc architecture .    motivated by the aforementioned considerations , we present a mixed - adc receiver architecture named mixed - adc massive mimo system in the current study . in this architecture , most antennas were installed with low - resolution adcs while a few antennas were equipped with full - resolution adcs .",
    "a special case of the mixed - adc massive mimo system was initially proposed by @xcite ; in this scenario , _",
    "1-bit _ adcs replace the low - resolution adcs . under the mixed - adc framework",
    ", csi can be obtained in a round - robin manner @xcite in which high - resolution adcs are connected to different antennas at various symbol times to estimate the corresponding channel coefficients . in the process , good - quality csi is available at the receiver without significant pilots overhead .",
    "the available high - resolution chains can also assist in estimating other parameters and thus facilitate the establishment of several front - end designs , such as agc and time / frequency synchronization . from an economic perspective , the mixed - adc architecture is promising because it can be implemented by adding antennas with low - resolution adcs to the existing bs .",
    "* contributions * : in this study , we aim to examine mixed - adc massive mimo systems from a practical engineering perspective .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , which emphasizes the analysis of mutual information , our approach focuses on the mimo ( or multiuser ) detection problem at the receiver . an extensive review of the large family of various mimo detection algorithms is provided in @xcite , and mimo detectors based on quantized samples are studied in @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no research has shed light on mimo detection problems in mixed - adc architecture , the design and performance of which are in fact a central concern related to this architecture .",
    "this paper makes the following specific contributions :    * by exploiting probabilistic bayesian inference , we provide a _ unified _ framework to develop a family of mimo detectors .",
    "this framework is labeled as the ( generic ) bayes detector . to compute the bayesian estimate",
    ", we must establish a prior distribution for the transmitted data and a likelihood function for the statistical model of receiver signals .",
    "upon adopting the true prior and likelihood functions , the bayes detector can achieve the best estimate in the mean squared error ( mse ) sense . properly postulating mismatched prior and likelihood functions",
    "can yield many low - complexity and popular detectors , such as the linear minimum mean - squared - error ( lmmse ) and maximal - ratio - combining ( mrc ) receivers .",
    "* the exact expression for the likelihood of a receiver signal with quantization is complex given the highly nonlinear property of the quantizer .",
    "the `` mixture '' architecture complicates the design of the bayes detector further .",
    "a natural question is the following : _ how close to the best performance can a conventional mimo detector operate without considering the exact ( while annoying ) nonlinear effect of the quantizers ? _ to answer this question , we adopt a traditional heuristic that treats quantization noise as additive and independent .",
    "this heuristic is known as the pseudo - quantization noise ( pqn ) model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) . by postulating a mismatched likelihood using this model in the bayes detector",
    ", we can reduce computational cost significantly while degrading performance only slightly . * to achieve the bayes detector , we employ a recently developed technique called _ generalized approximate message passing _ ( gamp ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "we adapt this approximation for the mixed - adc architecture by specifying the corresponding adjustment in nonlinear steps . by applying the central - limit theorem ( clt ) to the large system limit",
    ", we derive an approximate analytical expression for the _ state evolution _ ( se ) of the bayes detector .",
    "a series of metrics , including bit error rate ( ber ) and mse , can be predicted , and computer simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our analysis .",
    "the performance of the mixed - adc massive mimo receivers can be quickly and efficiently evaluated .",
    "several useful observations are made based on the analysis to optimize the receiver design .",
    "* notation * : throughout this paper , vectors and matrices are presented in bold typeface , e.g. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , while scalars are presented in regular typeface , e.g. , @xmath3 .",

    "this assumption is without loss of generality because in practice , a variable gain amplifier with automatic gain control is used before quantization .",
    "moreover , the equivalent row normalized channel @xmath27 simplifies the discussion in this study . ] .",
    "the entries of @xmath28 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "the real and imaginary components of the received signal at each antenna are quantized separately by an adc .",
    "the quantization bits are set differently for different antennas in the mixed - adc massive mimo system .",
    "all the @xmath18 complex valued quantizers are _ abstractly _ described as @xmath35 so that the quantized signal can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath35 is applied element - wise and defined such that @xmath37 .",
    "if a statement is for a generic antenna index , we often omit the subscript index @xmath38 from @xmath39 for brevity .    in this paper , we mainly focus on uniform midrise quantizers with quantization step size @xmath40 .",

    "notice that an input of magnitude larger than @xmath47 saturate .",
    "for ease of explication , we simply express the lower and upper thresholds associated with @xmath44 as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ; specifically , they are    [ quanbound ] @xmath50 and @xmath51    we assume that most of the antennas adopt low - resolution adcs ( e.g. , @xmath52 bit ) while only a few antennas adopt high - resolution adcs ( e.g. , @xmath53 bit ) . to distinguish the various adcs , we use @xmath54 to indicate the collection of the antennas equipped with adcs of @xmath46 bits .",
    "moreover , the cardinality of @xmath55 is @xmath56 , and thus we have @xmath57 .",
    "compared with the conventional massive mimo system equipped with high - resolution adcs , such a mixed - adc architecture remarkably reduces the circuit cost and power consumption .",

    ", good - quality csi is available at the receiver without significant pilots overhead .",
    "we assume that the realization of the channel is perfectly known by the bs ; thus , we focus on the detection problem .",
    "to recover the multiuser signals @xmath1 from the quantized measurement @xmath58 , we adopt the bayesian inference .",
    "the bayesian inference starts with computing the posterior probability @xmath59 according to the bayes rule @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the marginal likelihood function , @xmath62 is a likelihood function , and @xmath63 is a measure of the input distribution @xmath64 . here ,",
    "@xmath65 ( including @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) indicates that the probability is different from the actual one , @xmath68 .    using the posterior probability ,",
    "the bayes estimate of the unknown vector @xmath1 is the mean of the posterior distribution and its element is expressed as @xmath69 where the expectation over @xmath70 is w.r.t .",
    "the marginal posterior probability @xmath71 the notation @xmath72 denotes the integration over all the variables in @xmath1 except for @xmath70 .",
    "note that all our developed mimo `` detectors '' are centred around the framework of ( [ 2.5 ] ) , which should be classified as an estimation problem rather than a detection problem .",
    "however , transmitted signal @xmath73 is typically formed by a constellation modulation scheme such as quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) . in such cases ,",
    "the final constellation point can be determined from @xmath74 via the maximum - likelihood decision rule .",
    "therefore , with an abuse of terminology , we call the framework for obtaining ( [ 2.5 ] ) the ( generic ) bayes `` detector '' .    according to ( [ 2.4 ] ) , the posterior @xmath59 is determined by @xmath62 and @xmath75 .",
    "postulating a mismatched measure @xmath76 is due to a particular choice that can reduce computational complexity @xcite .",
    "we discuss these properties in the subsequent subsections . with reference the bayes detector ,",
    "we always mean ( [ 2.5 ] ) with general @xmath67 and @xmath77 .",
    "we begin with the detector development from the true @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e , no mismatch between @xmath68 and @xmath65 .",

    "in this case , @xmath74 via ( [ 2.5 ] ) can achieve the best estimates in terms of mse .",
    "we refer to this detector as the de - quantization ( dq)-optimal detector .    however , the dq - optimal detector is not computationally tractable because the marginal posterior probability @xmath85 in ( [ 2.6 ] ) involves a high - dimensional integral",
    ". the canonical solution to this problem is using _ belief propagation _ ( bp ) by expressing the posterior probability @xmath84 as a factor graph @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the complexity of bp is still too high for practical application . to solve this problem ,",
    "bp was recently simplified as the gamp algorithm @xcite by using the second - order approximations at measurement nodes .",
    "we resort to the gamp algorithm as an iterative procedure to solve the marginal posterior probability in a recursive way .",

    "next , we purpose a further complexity reduction on the nonlinear steps by imposing an additional mismatch in @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , if we postulate that the input is gaussian , i.e. , @xmath130 , then the bayes detector over the pqn model ( [ 3.3 ] ) becomes a linear detector .",

    "the linear estimator ( [ 3.7 ] ) can also be implemented via algorithm [ alg : gamp ] . to this end",
    ", we substitute @xmath135 into ( [ eq : px ] ) , and then lines 78 of algorithm [ alg : gamp ] become @xmath136 now , the nonlinear steps of @xmath94 and @xmath95 become simple linear steps ( [ eq : x_linear ] ) .    the computational complexity order for the dimensional matrix inversion in ( [ 3.7 ] ) is @xmath137 .",

    "in fact , algorithm [ alg : gamp ] converges very quickly after 810 iterations .",
    "thus , the computational complexity by using algorithm [ alg : gamp ] is smaller than that of the conventional linear detector ( [ 3.7 ] ) using the matrix inversion .",

    "\\(3 ) _ computational simplicity_. the analytical result is computationally simple because the corresponding parameters ( i.e. , @xmath171 ) can be obtained in an iterative way , with each iteration only involving scalar summations ( [ 4.2a])([4.2c ] ) and scalar estimation computations ( [ 4.2d])([4.2 g ] ) .",
    "in fact , using ( [ 4.1 ] ) , we can predict the se in time of algorithm [ alg : gamp ] in the mixed - adc massive mimo system .",
    "therefore , instead of performing time - consuming monte carlo simulations to obtain the corresponding performance metrics , we can predict the theoretical behavior by se equations in a very short time .",
    "we now show special cases of the se equations in section [ sec 4.1 ] . to present a relatively intuitive analytical result , all the expressions and discussions in this subsection",
    "are centered on a qpsk input distribution although our analysis can be incorporated with arbitrary input distributions .",

    "so far , we have used the variance of a uniform distribution on a quantization interval @xmath185 $ ] to model @xmath184 , i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "we now examine this approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the mses of the pdq - optimal detector with varying numbers of quantization bit depth @xmath46 for gaussian transmitted inputs . from the results in figures [ fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b )",
    ", we find that in a typical massive mimo system ( e.g. , @xmath187 ) , the mses of the pdq - optimal detector are not sensitive to the value of @xmath123 as long as its value is small enough , e.g. , @xmath188 .",
    "however , for the case when the number of antennas are compatible with that of the users ( e.g. , @xmath189 ) , we should be more careful in selecting the value of @xmath123 .",
    "comparing the triangle markers that correspond to the lowest mse and the cross markers determined by @xmath186 , we find that approximating @xmath123 by the latter rule is generally good enough .",
    "although not precise , this rule of thumb seems effective .",
    "we have discussed the optimal parameter settings for the quantization step size and the regularization factor . using these optimal parameters ,",
    "we now investigate the performance of the mixed - adc architecture .",
    "our discussions focus on the following question : _ how close to the best performance can a mimo detector operate without considering the exact nonlinear effect of the quantizers ? _ in the following subsections , we refer to a system where most of the antennas adopt 1-bit resolution adcs while the rest have full precision adcs as _ the mixed 1-bit _ architecture .",
    "we also have the _",
    "mixed 2-bit _ architecture and others .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] illustrates the ber versus the snr under different mixed architectures for qpsk inputs .",
    "clearly , the mixed architecture helps improve the performance .",
    "for example , for the mixed 1-bit architecture , merely installing @xmath190 high - resolution adcs ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) eliminates the error floor caused by the distortion of the mismatched measure of the pdq - optimal detector as well as the 1-bit quantization .",
    "if we further increase the fraction of the full - precision adcs to @xmath192 ( i.e.,@xmath193 ) , the mixed pdq - optimal detector can achieve similar performance as the pure 1-bit dq - optimal detector .",
    "also , in the mixed 2-bit architecture , an @xmath194 2-bit quantization mixed pdq - optimal detector achieves a performance similar to the pure 2-bit dq - optimal detector .",
    "recall that the dq - optimal detector is considered to achieve the best estimate in terms of minimizing the mse .",
    "we conclude that the mixed architecture can help maintain the promised performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity by ignoring the exact but complex quantization process .",
    "in addition , comparing figures [ fig6](a ) and [ fig6](b ) , we notice that the mixed architecture is more advantageous to the pdq - optimal detector than the dq - optimal detector , which will also be validated by figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "in such an input type , the pdq - optimal detector is exactly the linear detector because both the postulated and the actual inputs are gaussian .",
    "we start by providing insights into the effect of quantization based on the non - mixed architecture .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] illustrates the mses of the detectors versus the antenna configuration ratios @xmath195 for snr=@xmath133db and snr=@xmath196db . as shown in figure  [ fig7](a ) , when snr=@xmath133db , the performance degradation compared to the unquantized case caused by 1-bit quantization is approximately 3db , indicating that ignoring the exact quantization effect is feasible in the low snr regime . in the high snr regime",
    ", however , a 1-bit resolution generally incurs significant performance losses as shown in figure  [ fig7](b ) . in a typical _ massive _ mimo system ( e.g. , @xmath197 )",
    ", the pdq - optimal detector generally causes 1-bit loss compared with the dq - optimal detector .",
    "for example , the 2-bit pdq - optimal detector has the same performance as the 1-bit dq - optimal detector .",
    "alternatively , the loss caused by the simplification of the quantization process can be compensated by doubling the number of receiver antennas .",
    "figures [ fig7](a ) and [ fig7](b ) shows that the mses of the detectors generally improve by 36db for each 1-bit rate increase .",
    "the higher the snr is , the closer the mse improvement is to 6db .",
    "in contrast to figure  [ fig7 ] , which focuses on the non - mixed architecture , figure  [ fig8 ] illustrates the results under the mixed architecture .",
    "it can be seen that the mixed architecture can help narrow the performance gap resulting from the pqn model .",
    "for example , in a massive mimo system with @xmath198 , the pure 1-bit pdq - optimal detector incurs approximately 6db loss compared with the pure 1-bit dq - optimal detector .",
    "their corresponding gaps are respectively reduced to 3db and 1db when @xmath190 and @xmath199 full precision adcs are installed .",
    "using a unified framework , we specified three kinds of detectors for a mixed - adc massive mimo receiver by postulating mismatched measures in the bayes detector .",
    "the asymptotic performances of these detectors were analyzed by the se equations and their accuracy were validated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the se equations can be quickly and efficiently evaluated ; thus , they are useful in system design optimization .",
    "we provided useful observations to aid design optimization .",
    "in particular , the results showed that we can reduce the computational burden by treating the complex nonlinear quantization process as a pqn model .",
    "ignoring such a complex quantization process may cause 1-bit performance degradation on the high - snr regime but does not have a significant effect in the low - snr regime .",
    "moreover , the mixed receiver architecture can help narrow the performance gap resulting from the pqn model .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the se equations of algorithm [ alg : gamp ] in the large - system limit ( i.e. , @xmath200 ) by following @xcite . for conceptual clarity and ease of explanation , we restrict the derivation to a corresponding real - valued system although proposition 1 is for the complex - valued case . in addition , for brevity , we omit all the iteration index @xmath86 .",
    "we recall from lines 78 of algorithm [ alg : gamp ] that the conditional mean and variance of @xmath70 denoted by @xmath201 and @xmath202 , respectively , are taken w.r.t .",
