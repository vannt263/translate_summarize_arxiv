    "quantum mechanics predicts that the particles can be classified in two groups : fermions @xcite and bosons @xcite . in early works",
    ", these systems were studied in the absence of interaction and fundamental concepts such as the pauli exclusion principle for fermions and the bose - einstein condensation for bosons were evidenced .",
    "fermi statistics forces the particles to occupy successively higher energy levels while bosons at zero temperature all condense into the ground state . in these ideal systems ,",
    "the distribution of particles is spatially homogeneous .",
    "however , for very massive systems , as in astrophysical situations , one must take self - gravity into account . in that case",
    ", the system becomes spatially inhomogeneous and centrally condensed .",
    "this leads to the concepts of fermion @xcite and boson @xcite stars .",
    "soon after the discovery of the quantum statistics for fermions by fermi @xcite ( 1926 ) and dirac @xcite ( 1926 ) , fowler @xcite ( 1926 ) , in a paper entitled `` dense matter '' , understood that white dwarf stars owe their stability to the quantum pressure of the degenerate electron gas .",
    "therefore , gravitational collapse is avoided by pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "fowler modeled a white dwarf star at zero temperature by a completely degenerate fermi gas in gravitational equilibrium .",
    "he noted that the star is `` strictly analogous to one gigantic molecule in its lowest quantum state . '' as shown by milne ( 1930 ) @xcite and chandrasekhar ( 1931a ) @xcite , the resulting structure is equivalent to a polytrope of index @xmath0 so that the mass - radius relation of classical white dwarf stars is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the electron , @xmath3 the mass of the proton and @xmath4 the molecular weight .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1931b,1935 ) @xcite took special relativity into account and showed that the star becomes equivalent to a polytrope of index @xmath5 in the ultra - relativistic limit . from that result , he deduced the existence of a maximum mass @xmath6 above which there is no hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this mass @xmath7 is of the order of the solar mass ( @xmath8 for @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite which is the order of magnitude of the white dwarfs ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass and mean density are @xmath11 and @xmath12 . ]",
    "massive stars can not pass into the white dwarf stage .",
    "they undergo gravitational collapse and become neutron stars in which gravitational contraction is arrested by the quantum pressure of the neutrons .",
    "the structure of neutron stars was studied by oppenheimer & volkoff ( 1939 ) @xcite using general relativity .",
    "they obtained a maximum mass @xmath13 ( and a corresponding radius @xmath14 and density @xmath15 ) above which no equilibrium state exists ( the chandrasekhar calculations , neglecting general relativity , lead to a larger value of the maximum mass @xmath16 ) . in that case , nothing prevents the gravitational contraction of the star which becomes a black hole .",
    "the mass - radius relation @xmath17 of neutron stars makes a spiral while the mass - central density relation @xmath18 presents damped oscillations .",
    "the series of equilibria becomes unstable after the first mass peak which corresponds to the maximum mass @xcite .",
    "the existence of a limiting mass for self - gravitating fermions , the chandrasekhar mass , is striking because it can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants similarly to bohr s radius of the atom @xcite . this limiting mass arises because of relativistic effects . for a non - relativistic fermion star , we have the mass - radius relation @xmath19 that is valid for small masses @xmath20 . for general relativistic fermion stars @xcite , the maximum mass and the minimum radius can be written @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the planck mass and @xmath24 is the planck length .",
    "the radius can be expressed in terms of the compton wavelength of the fermions @xmath25 as @xmath26 . for @xmath27 , we get @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    the preceding results are valid at @xmath30 .",
    "the self - gravitating fermi gas at non - zero temperature has been studied in the context of statistical mechanics by hertel & thirring ( 1971 ) @xcite , messer ( 1981 ) @xcite and more recently by chavanis ( 2002 ) @xcite ( an exhaustive description of the phase diagrams in canonical and microcanonical ensembles is presented in the review @xcite ) . in these studies ,",
    "the system must be enclosed within an artificial `` box '' so as to avoid its complete evaporation . for large systems , one recovers the classical isothermal self - gravitating gas @xcite that may undergo a gravothermal catastrophe @xcite in the microcanonical ensemble ( fixed energy ) or an isothermal collapse @xcite in the canonical ensemble ( fixed temperature ) .",
    "if the particles are fermions , the gravitational collapse stops when quantum degeneracy effects ( pauli exclusion principle ) come into play .",
    "this leads to the formation of a composite structure made of a completely degenerate and very compact nucleus ( fermion ball ) surrounded by a dilute atmosphere @xcite .",
    "self - gravitating fermions were also discussed in cosmology , in models where dark matter is made of massive neutrinos .",
    "originally , the self - gravitating fermi gas with neutrino masses in the @xmath31 range was proposed by ruffini and co - workers ( 1982 - 1990 ) @xcite as a model for dark matter halos ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and clusters of galaxies .",
    "then , viollier and coworkers ( 1997 - 2001 ) @xcite suggested that degenerate superstars composed of weakly interacting fermions in the @xmath34 range could be an alternative to the supermassive black holes that are reported to exist at the centers of galaxies ( e.g. @xmath35 and @xmath36 in our galaxy ) .",
    "finally , bilic _",
    "( 2003 ) @xcite showed that a weakly interacting fermionic gas at finite temperature could provide a self - consistent model of dark matter that describes both the center and the halo of the galaxies .",
    "since the density of a self - gravitating isothermal sphere decreases as @xmath37 at large distances , this model is consistent with the flat rotation curves of the galaxies . on the other hand , since the core is degenerate in the sense of quantum mechanics ( pauli exclusion principle ) , it leads to flat density profiles and avoids the cusp problem of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , the gravitational collapse of fermionic matter leads to a compact object ( fermion ball ) at the center of the galaxy that could mimic a central black hole .    coincidentally",
    ", the fermi - dirac statistics also arises in the theory of violent relaxation developed by lynden - bell ( 1967 ) @xcite for the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "however , in that case , the origin of the `` degeneracy '' is due to dynamical constraints ( liouville s theorem ) instead of quantum mechanics ( pauli s principle ) .",
    "this theory was initially developed to describe collisionless stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies . in that case",
    ", the non - degenerate limit may be the most relevant @xcite .",
    "however , as proposed by kull _",
    "( 1996 ) @xcite and chavanis & sommeria ( 1998 ) @xcite , this approach ( with dynamical degeneracy retained ) could also apply to dark matter halos and provide a much more efficient relaxation mechanism than in the fermion scenario .",
    "indeed , the violent relaxation of collisionless systems ( leading to the lynden - bell statistics ) takes place on a few dynamical times while the collisional relaxation of fermions ( leading to the fermi - dirac statistics ) is larger than the age of the universe by several orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , it is not clear how the fermions have thermalized and how they can possess sufficiently large temperatures .",
    "by contrast , the lynden - bell theory predicts a large effective temperature ( even if @xmath30 initially ) , a @xmath37 density profile at large distances consistent with the flat rotation curves of galaxies and an effective exclusion principle at short distances that could avoid the cusp problem and lead to fermion balls mimicking black holes , just like in the fermionic scenario .",
    "therefore , fermion stars rapidly found applications in relation to white dwarf stars , neutron stars , massive neutrinos in dark matter models , and in the violent relaxation of collisionless self - gravitating systems .",
    "the concept of boson stars was introduced by kaup ( 1968 ) @xcite and ruffini & bonazzola ( 1969 ) @xcite although no astrophysical application of these objects was known at that time .",
    "they were just hypothetical stars whose main interest was ruled by the fundamental laws of physics that govern their structure . in a sense ,",
    "boson stars are descendent of the so - called _ geons _ of wheeler ( 1955 ) @xcite except that they are built from scalar particles ( spin-@xmath38 ) instead of electromagnetic fields , i.e. spin-@xmath39 bosons .",
    "kaup and ruffini & bonazzola considered the @xmath30 limit at which the bosons form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and showed that the concept of an equation of state breaks down .",
    "indeed , at zero temperature a boson gas has a vanishing pressure and is unable to sustain any configuration of equilibrium in the classical perfect fluid approximation .",
    "but if one considers a quantum system of massive self - gravitating bosons in their ground state self - consistently , stable equilibrium configurations exist . in that case , all the bosons are in the same quantum state and they are described by a unique wave function @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , boson stars can be regarded as macroscopic quantum states that are only prevented from collapsing gravitationally by the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath41 . in the newtonian approximation ,",
    "a self - gravitating bec is described by the schrdinger - poisson system and in the relativistic case one must couple the klein - gordon equation to the einstein field equations .",
    "the newtonian approximation is valid for sufficiently small masses and yields the mass - radius relation @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the radius containing @xmath44 of the mass ) @xcite .",
    "the radius decreases as mass increases , like for classical white dwarf stars , but the scaling is different . when relativistic effects are taken into account , there exists a maximum mass , the kaup mass @xmath45 , above which no equilibrium configuration exists @xcite . in that case , the system collapses to a black hole .",
    "the minimum radius @xmath46 corresponding to the kaup mass is of the order of the compton wavelength @xmath25 of the bosons .",
    "these results were re - derived independently by thirring ( 1983 ) @xcite and breit _ et al . _",
    "( 1984 ) @xcite .",
    "there exists remarkable similarities between boson and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "for example , the mass - central density relation @xmath18 of boson stars exhibits damped oscillations and the series of equilibria becomes dynamically unstable after the first mass peak corresponding to the maximum mass @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass - radius relation @xmath17 has a snail - like ( spiral ) structure , and the mass - particle number relation @xmath47 presents cusps .",
    "the newtonian approximation is valid for sufficiently low densities corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "boson stars become relativistic when they approach the maximum mass @xmath50 and the corresponding radius @xmath51 . except for matters of scales ,",
    "all these results are remarkably similar to those obtained for neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however , there also exists crucial differences between self - gravitating objects made of fermions or bosons .",
    "in particular , boson stars are stopped from collapsing by heisenberg s uncertainty principle while for fermion stars gravitational collapse is avoided by pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "this difference is reflected in the critical mass of stable configurations : @xmath52 for fermions and @xmath53 for bosons .",
    "this difference is due principally to the fact that all the @xmath54 bosons are in the ground state whereas the @xmath54 fermions , according to the pauli exclusion principle , are distributed in the @xmath54 lowest energy states of the phase space . as a result , the mass of boson stars @xmath53 is generally much smaller than the mass of fermion stars @xmath52 .",
    "they differ by a factor @xmath55 .",
    "for example , for @xmath27 for which @xmath56 , one can estimate the total mass of a boson star to be @xmath57 and its radius @xmath58 yielding a density @xmath59 times that of a neutron star .",
    "contrary to the mass of neutron stars that is of the order of a solar mass , the mass of these mini boson stars is too small to be astrophysically relevant .",
    "they could play a role , however , if they exist in the universe in large quantity or if the mass @xmath60 of the bosons is extraordinary small leading to macroscopic objects with a mass comparable to the mass of the sun ( or even larger ) @xcite .",
    "this is the case , in particular , for axionic boson stars that could account for the mass of machos ( between @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath63 ) if the axions have a mass @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "colpi _ et al . _",
    "( 1986 ) @xcite considered the case of self - interacting scalar fields with a @xmath65 term and found that the resulting configurations differ markedly from the non - interacting case even when @xmath66 . in that case",
    ", the maximum mass @xmath67 may be comparable with the chandrasekhar mass of self - gravitating fermions when @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , the radius @xmath69 of self - interacting boson stars may be much larger than the compton wavelength and become comparable with the radius of fermion stars . for @xmath70 , boson star configurations exist with a mass @xmath71 and a radius @xmath72 similar to those of neutron stars . for smaller masses",
    "@xmath73 , we get @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the radius is comparable to that of the sun but it encloses @xmath76 solar masses .",
    "these parameters are reminiscent of supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei , so that boson stars , like fermion stars , could be an alternative to black holes @xcite .",
    "these enhancements of mass and size are due to the parameter @xmath77 that is very large even for small @xmath78 due to the smallness of @xmath60 relative to @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , self - coupling can significantly change the physical dimensions of boson stars , making them much more astrophysically interesting .",
    "the self - interaction has the same effect on the bosons as the exclusion principle on fermions .",
    "it plays the role of an interparticle _ repulsion _ ( for @xmath80 ) that dominates over uncertainty pressure and prevents catastrophic gravitational collapse .",
    "@xcite showed that a quartic self - interaction is equivalent to an effective barotropic pressure . at low densities @xmath81 ( polytrope @xmath82 ) and at high densities @xmath83 ( linear ) like in the core of neutron stars",
    "@xcite ( this result is not explicitly given in @xcite but it can be obtained as a limit of their eq .",
    "this strengthens the analogy between boson stars and neutron stars .",
    "since boson stars may have masses comparable to the mass of neutron stars , or even larger , they become astrophysical relevant and may play a role in the problem of dark matter @xcite .",
    "a wide `` zoology '' of exotic particles that could form dark matter has been proposed . in particular , many grand unified theories in particle physics predict the existence of various exotic bosons ( e.g. axions , scalar neutrinos , neutralinos ) that should be present in considerable abundance in the universe and comprise ( part of ) the cosmological missing mass @xcite . although the bosonic particles have never been detected in accelerator experiments , they are considered as leading candidates of dark matter and might play a significant role in the evolution and the structure of the universe .",
    "the formation of boson stars was investigated by madsen & liddle ( 1990 ) @xcite and is now relatively well understood .",
    "a spatially homogeneous distribution of self - gravitating bosons can undergo a sort of jeans instability as described by khlopov _",
    "et al . _ ( 1985 ) @xcite and bianchi _ et al . _",
    "( 1990 ) @xcite .",
    "when the perturbation has sufficiently grown , the cloud collapses under its own gravity at first in free fall .",
    "then , as nonlinear gravitational effects become important at higher densities , the configuration starts to oscillate and settles into a compact bosonic object through the radiation of the scalar field .",
    "this gravitational cooling process has been evidenced and studied by seidel & suen ( 1994 ) @xcite .",
    "this is a dissipationless mechanism similar in some respect to the violent relaxation of collisionless stellar systems @xcite but ending on a unique final state ( boson star ) independent on the initial conditions .",
    "therefore , ( mini ) boson stars could be the constituents of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "later , it was suggested that dark matter halos themselves could be gigantic self - gravitating becs .",
    "this idea was introduced in order to solve basic problems inherent to cold dark matter models .",
    "dark matter is one of the most important puzzles in modern physics and cosmology .",
    "cold dark matter ( @xmath84cdm ) models with a small cosmological constant comprising weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , such as the lightest neutralinos , are presently favored by theorists over hot dark matter ( hdm ) models comprising relativistic light neutrinos .",
    "although the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is popular and remarkably successful in explaining the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite , it seems to encounter many problems on the scale of galactic or sub - galactic structures .",
    "indeed , cdm simulations lead to @xmath85 cuspy density profiles at galactic centers ( in the scales of the order of @xmath39 kpc and smaller ) @xcite while most rotation curves indicate a smooth core density @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted number of satellite galaxies around each galactic halo is far beyond what we see around the milky way @xcite .",
    "these problems might be solved , without altering the virtues of cdm models , if the dark matter is composed of scalar particles in a cold bec .",
    "the wave properties of the dark matter may stabilize the system against gravitational collapse as a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , providing halo cores instead of cuspy profiles .",
    "the resulting coherent configuration may be understood as the ground state of some gigantic bosonic atom where the ultra - light boson particles are condensed in a single macroscopic quantum state @xmath40 . in these models ,",
    "the formation of dark matter structures at small scales is suppressed by the quantum uncertainty principle .",
    "this property could alleviate the problems of the cdm model such as the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem .",
    "the first suggestion that galactic halos are formed by bosons , either in their quantum ground state ( bec ) or in an appropriate isothermal distribution , is due to baldeschi _",
    "et al . _ ( 1983 ) @xcite .",
    "in order to yield masses and sizes that agree with those of galactic halos ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , the mass of the bosons must be extremely small @xmath88 ( estimated with the newtonian mass - radius relation ) .",
    "the idea that galactic halos could be a giant system of `` bose liquid '' was also advanced by sin ( 1994 ) @xcite who studied rotation curves induced by self - gravitating becs .",
    "sin considered the ultralight pseudo nambu - goldstone boson ( axion ) appearing in the late - time cosmological phase transition theories as a major dark matter candidate .",
    "since it is almost massless @xmath88 , its nature is more wavelike than particlelike so that the dark matter distribution must be treated quantum mechanically .",
    "therefore , galactic halos can be considered as self - gravitating bose liquids whose collapse is prevented by the uncertainty principle . at the galactic scale , the newtonian approximation turns out to be relevant .",
    "sin considered condensation wave functions for the galactic halo that have nodes ( excited states ) because the rotation curve of the zero node solution falls too fast to explain the flatness of the rotation curve of many galaxies .",
    "because of the systems wavelike nature , he found that the rotation curve of galaxies has a ripplelike fine structure that seems to agree with observations .",
    "however , this may be a coincidence because the presence of wiggles in the rotation curves is rather related to spiral arms inside the disks , and excited states are generally unstable @xcite .",
    "indeed , the excited modes decay to the ground state through emission of gravitational radiation , a process similar to atomic transitions @xcite . in this sense , boson stars are like gravitational atoms .",
    "an alternative scalar field matter model for dark halos of galaxies was developed by schunck ( 1998 ) @xcite .",
    "he obtains rotation curves that give a very good agreement with observations of spiral and dwarf galaxies . in this model ,",
    "the density decreases at large distances like @xmath37 yielding asymptotically flat rotation curves .",
    "furthermore , this model produces oscillations around this asymptotic value that can match , in some cases , the data .",
    "since these oscillations ( `` wiggles '' ) do not correspond to excited states , the solutions are stable .",
    "although these results are obtained in the newtonian limit , it is shown that the radial pressure coming from general relativity plays a role for the rotation velocity that is comparable to the contribution of the normal part .",
    "on the other hand , in the strongly relativistic case , this model leads to massive objects with large redshift values and rotation velocities .",
    "this might be an explanation for the large energy contributions seen in quasars @xcite . at about the same period ,",
    "matos & guzmn ( 1999 ) @xcite introduced a model in which dark matter is a scalar field embedded in an exponential ( and later cosh ) scalar potential .",
    "this model produces a density profile of the form @xmath89 which gives a good agreement with the rotation curve of galaxies and accounts for their flatness at large distances @xcite .",
    "it also explains the suppression of subgalactic structures ( since it produces a sharp cut - off in the mass power spectrum ) and the smoothness of galaxy core halos @xcite .",
    "this model has only one free parameter , the scalar field mass , whose determined value @xmath90 accounts both for the typical mass of galactic halos and for cosmological observations ( two _ a priori _ independent measurments ) @xcite .",
    "a similar mass was found by arbey _",
    "( 2001 ) @xcite and silverman & mallett ( 2002 ) @xcite .    in these models ,",
    "the self - interaction of the particles is neglected and the mass of the bosons must be extremely small in order to reproduce the characteristic mass and size of galactic halos .",
    "such an ultralight scalar field ( e.g. an axion ) with @xmath88 was called `` fuzzy cold dark matter '' ( fcdm ) by hu _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) @xcite who discussed its overall cosmological behavior .",
    "an alternative to this unnatural small mass is to take self - coupling into account . indeed , in the context of boson stars , the work of colpi _ et al . _",
    "( 1986 ) @xcite has demonstrated that , for the same value of the boson mass @xmath60 , even a small coupling can considerably change the mass and size of self - gravitating becs . in that case , values of the mass in the ballpark of an @xmath91 may be compatible with a size of a few kiloparsecs .",
    "lee & koh ( 1996 ) @xcite investigated relativistic boson stars with a self - interacting scalar field as a model of galactic halos . a massive scalar field or a boson condensate with quartic - or close to quartic - self - coupling",
    "was also proposed as a possible dark matter candidate by peebles ( 2000 ) @xcite , who called it `` fluid dark matter '' and by goodman ( 2000 ) @xcite who called it `` repulsive dark matter '' .",

    "bhmer & harko ( 2007 ) @xcite pursued the idea that dark matter is in the form of a self - gravitating bec and studied the condensate by using the non - relativistic gross - pitaevskii equation coupled to the poisson equation .",
