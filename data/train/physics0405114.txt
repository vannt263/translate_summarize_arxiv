    "stimulated raman backscattering ( rbs ) of laser radiation in plasmas  @xcite is a parametric process in which a laser beam ( pump wave ) is backscattered off the electron plasma density fluctuations .",
    "these density perturbations are driven and amplified by the ponderomotive beatwave of pump and scattered electromagnetic ( em ) waves . under certain phase matching conditions a positive feedback loop develops that results in the onset of a temporal or spatio - temporal instability  @xcite .",
    "the rbs in transversely homogeneous plasmas has been extensively studied since early 1970s  @xcite , when it first came to the fore in the context of fast electron generation and target pre - heat in laser confinement fusion .",
    "the basic treatment of the rbs in homogeneous plasmas is now a classic that can be found in a number of textbooks  @xcite .",
    "although rbs of long laser beams has been studied for at least three decades , the short - pulse regimes of this instability have only recently attracted attention due to the advances in generation and amplification of sub - picosecond multi - terawatt laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "the rbs of such pulses in rarefied homogeneous plasmas ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a fundamental frequency of laser , @xmath2 is an electron langmiur plasma frequency , @xmath3 is an electron charge , and @xmath4 is an electron plasma density ) was explored in detail in both experiment  @xcite and theory  @xcite .",
    "the recent upsurge of interest in the rbs has been specifically caused by theoretical discovery of the possibility to amplify and compress ultra - short laser pulses in a plasma by backscattering a long low - intensity counter - propagating laser beam  @xcite .",
    "certain applications of short - pulse lasers , such as novel x - ray source development  @xcite , generation of high harmonics of laser radiation  @xcite and laser particle acceleration  @xcite in tenuous plasmas , benefit from a long interaction distance . in a homogeneous plasma the region of high intensity interaction",
    "is confined to approximately one rayleigh diffraction length @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a wavenumber , and @xmath7 is a radius of a focal spot of a laser beam .",
    "propagation over longer distances requires some form of laser guiding .",
    "guiding by a plasma channel is the most promising experimental approach  @xcite for high laser intensities .",
    "excitation of relativistic plasma waves in channels was analyzed  @xcite for particle acceleration .",
    "the guided laser pulses are not immune to parametric instabilities , such as forward and near - forward stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) in parabolic  @xcite , tapered  @xcite , leaky  @xcite , and single - mode flat channels  @xcite , or large - angle srs in plasma - filled capillaries  @xcite .",
    "commonly , the energy losses of a laser pulse and excessive plasma heating due to the large - angle srs ( including rbs ) are undesirable for some applications  @xcite , and uncovering new physical mechanisms that enable the rbs suppression is up to date .",
    "for some applications , however , the rbs can be useful .",
    "e.g. , the laser pulse leading front depletion by the rbs may seed either forward srs or resonant modulational instability  @xcite .",
    "novel schemes of short - pulse amplification in a plasma  @xcite are based on the backscattering of a long moderately intense pump laser beam into a short counter - propagating signal pulse : the energy of the pump is absorbed by the signal as it is amplified and compressed .",
    "the raman compression could be a viable path to obtaining high - power single - cycle pulses .",
    "for transversely homogeneous plasmas , one of the challenges of raman amplification is to ensure the uniformity of plasma along the interaction axis so that the signal be downshifted from the pump by almost exactly the plasma frequency @xmath8 . in the present paper",
    "we discover novel features of the rbs in plasma channels , which are favorable for realization of raman amplification ( to anticipate , the rbs process in a deep plasma channel can be broadband enough to make exact resonant detuning of pump and signal unnecessary ) .    to enable analytic progress and to facilitate qualitative understanding , we focus on plasma channels that support a single confined hf em mode , referred to as a fundamental mode of channel ( fmc ) . the laser pulse confined in a channel is assumed to be the fmc .",
    "the rbs in a single - mode channel proceeds differently than in a homogeneous plasma and can be characterized by the following novel features : ( a ) reduction of the rbs peak temporal growth rate ; ( b ) broadening of the rbs amplification bandwidth ; ( c ) modification of the transverse profile of the scattered mode from that of fmc .",
    "depending on the parameters of channel ( such as on - axis plasma density and density depression ) and pump laser ( such as frequency and intensity ) , those modifications can be either more or less prominent .",
    "it was suggested earlier  @xcite in the context of raman forward scattering ( rfs ) that plasma frequency variation across the channel may significantly reduce the peak growth rate .",
    "the effect is resulted from a strong localization of a scattering electron plasma wave ( epw ) near the channel axis . however , due to the complicated hybrid em nature of a relativistic epw in a channel  @xcite , only approximate results were obtained in  .",
    "specifically , it was assumed that the scattered radiation was in the fundamental channel mode . for the rbs ,",
    "the em component of the short - wavelength epw may be neglected , enabling us to account for the transverse profile modification of the backscattered radiation .",
    "this is accomplished by expanding the transverse profile of the scattered field into the channel eigenmodes , i.e. , the fmc plus continuum of the non - bound hf em modes .",
    "these continuum modes of channel ( cmc ) do not exponentially decay outside of the channel ( as the fmc does ) and exhibit a cosine - like behavior at infinity , which makes them similar to the transverse fourier harmonics of scattered radiation in a homogeneous plasma .",
    "the problem is complicated by the fact that the fmc and cmc are not independent .",
    "radial shear of the plasma density couples them to each other not only creating the field structure different from that of fmc but also affecting spectral features of the instability .",
    "one of our goals is to evaluate the continuum - mode contribution to the rbs growth rate .",
    "we put emphasis on the regime of strong plasma wave localization ( spwl ) .",
    "spectral features of this regime are markedly different from those of the homogeneous - plasma rbs .",
    "the spwl occurs when the parameter @xmath9 is large compared to unity \\{here and elsewhere , @xmath10 is the maximum increment of the weakly coupled rbs in a homogeneous plasma  @xcite , @xmath11 is a plasma frequency on axis , @xmath12 is the channel depth , and @xmath13 is a normalized amplitude of electric field of the pump wave } , which physically means that the plasma frequency depression in a channel exceeds the rbs bandwidth in a homogeneous plasma . in the spwl regime ,",
    "the maximum temporal increment is shown to scale as @xmath14{\\eta}$ ] .",
    "hence , plasma wave localization suppresses the instability . on the other hand , the transverse shear of the plasma frequency results in a broader instability bandwidth .",
    "spectral maximum of the backscattered light is found to be red - shifted from the pump frequency by more than @xmath15 , and the spectrum itself extends on the red side far beyond the frequency bandwidth of the homogeneous - plasma rbs .",
    "the bandwidth increase is due to the backscattering off the channel regions with higher local plasma frequencies and , therefore , higher red - shifts of scattered light . in the spwl regime",
    ", the cmc contribution transversely shrinks the fastest - growing mode of scattered radiation and concentrates the scattered field near the channel axis .",
    "this effect is followed by enhancement of the rbs ( in the numerical examples presented in the paper , the continuum modes add from 25% to 50% to the peak value of temporal increment ) .",
    "the cmc contribution to the rbs process may be neglected if the pump amplitude is sufficiently small ( or the channel is deep ) to satisfy the inequality @xmath16 .",
    "this regime is referred to as single - mode , because the scattered field is fairly well represented solely by fmc . that only three unstable waves ( two bound em modes and a localized epw ) participate",
    "the single - mode rbs makes it the channel analog of the three - wave ( i.e. , weakly coupled ) rbs in a homogeneous plasma despite the vast difference in spectral features . in the single - mode regime",
    "an analytic solution of the initial - value problem has been found , which describes the evolution of the single - mode backscattered em signal in the field of a single - mode pump .",
    "it is shown that the maximum of the wave packet moves with the velocity @xmath17 , which is higher than a group velocity of radiation @xmath18 of the weakly coupled rbs in a homogeneous plasma .",
    "high group velocity of the amplified pulse and its broad bandwidth produced by the transverse shear of plasma density profitably distinguish the single - mode raman amplification in a plasma channel from its homogeneous - plasma counterpart  @xcite .",
