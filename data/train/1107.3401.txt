    "in 1819 a quartic wave surface was discovered by fresnel in the study of crystal optics .",
    "later kummer observed that the surface had the maximum possible number of nodes of a quartic in the complex projective space @xmath0 and he constructed a surface with only real nodes . since then the subject of algebraic surfaces has a rich history with plenty of achievements .",
    "a construction of surfaces with degree @xmath1 in @xmath0 having only nondegenerate singular points , or double points , was introduced by chmutov in @xcite .",
    "it was based on his previous idea of using chebyshev polynomials and on the givental methods for generating cubics @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the chmutov construction can be adapted to give surfaces with only real singularities . in @xmath2 a node or @xmath3 singularity can be written in the form @xmath4 in some local coordinates . in @xmath5",
    "there are two types of nodes , conical nodes ( @xmath6 ) and solitary nodes ( @xmath7 ) and the construction produces conical nodes .",
    "the main idea consists in defining real folding polynomials @xmath8 $ ] associated to the root lattice @xmath9 ( which are generalizations of chebyshev polynomials , related with the root lattice @xmath10 ) . in the cases with degrees 6,7,8,10,12 , there are higher lower bounds for the maximum number of real nodes @xmath11 on a surface of degree @xmath1 .",
    "a 65-nodal sextic and a 345-nodal decic invariant under the symmetry group of the icosahedron were constructed by barth @xcite .",
    "other surfaces with the higher lower bounds known are labs 's 99-nodal septic , endrass 's 168-nodal octic , and the surface of degree 12 with @xmath12 nodes , invariant under the reflection group of the regular four - dimensional 600-cell , introduced by sarti @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite show that all known lower bounds for the maximum number of nodes on a surface of degree @xmath1 , can be attained with only real singularities .",
    "in this article we consider a construction motivated by recent work on tilings generated by substitution or inflation rules .",
