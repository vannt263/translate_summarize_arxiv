    "since this variability arises in the quasar continuum source itself , it appears in all the images of a gravitationally lensed quasar , but at different times in each image due to differences in the gravitational potential of the lens galaxy and the geometric length of the paths of each image @xcite . as first pointed out by @xcite",
    ", the stars near each lensed image also cause temporal variations in the magnification of each image , leading to additional variability .",
    "this `` microlensing '' variability is not correlated between the images , so it functions as both a difficult source of noise in time delay measurements and as a probe of quasar structure because the size of the emission region ultimately controls the amplitude of the microlensing variability .",
    "traditional time delay measurements require either that the microlensing variability is of sufficiently small amplitude so as to be insignificant in the analysis or that its timescale is significantly longer than that of the quasar s intrinsic variability , allowing for some sort of parametric modeling and subtraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we supplement our previously published light curves with 4 new seasons of monitoring data from two observatories and make a second attempt .    in the models of @xcite , we could also marginalize over the time delay uncertainties and use the microlensing to study the structure of the quasar .",
    "the amplitudes and the timescales of the variability due to quasar microlensing are a function of a number of physical variables such as the continuum source size , the mean properties of the lens in the vicinity of the lensed images , and the relative velocities of the source , the lens and the observer . during the last decade",

    "the model prediction for a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) lens model is that a leads b by @xmath51  days .",
    "we chose to shift image a because it is less variable than image b. our analysis algorithm requires contemporaneous pairs of a / b data points , in most cases necessitating linear interpolation between bracketing epochs . for shifted points that fell into the inter - season gaps , we permitted 5 days of linear extrapolation , and we increased the size of the measurement uncertainties on the extrapolated points using our estimate of the quasar s intrinsic variability structure function . since the bayesian integral shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : bayes ] is actually a discrete sum in which the statistical weight of each trial time delay must be held fixed , all trial lightcurves must have the same number of epochs , forcing us to discard some data points for the shorter trial delays .",
    "the details of this selection technique are described in @xcite .",
    "we also generated a second set of trial light curves , permitting unlimited extrapolation in the inter - season gaps using the damped random walk ( drw ) models of @xcite and @xcite . using the implementation of @xcite",
    ", we first modeled the raw lightcurves , yielding a long term variability structure function measurement @xmath52  mags and timescale @xmath53  days for image a and @xmath54  mags and timescale @xmath55  days for image b. these models also provide the structure function estimate used in our first approach .",
    "the obvious advantage of this treatment is that no data must be discarded , however the drw process models the intrinsic variability in the light curves of only one image at a time such that the variability in the drw points is not correlated with the contemporary points in the other image . in the absence of the strong microlensing signal , we would model the light curves jointly , following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "the introduction of additional uncorrelated variability can be significant , particularly for the longer trial delays , forcing the models to fit the differences in the drw interpolations as microlensing .",
    "this further blurred any effects of the time delay , so we do not report on these results .    because we have only 6 epochs of x - ray observations , we are unable to shift the x - ray measurements by the trial time delay , since doing so would eliminate most of our data points .",
    "both our macroscopic mass models and this present work predict a relatively short time delay @xmath56  days , but it is likely that some intrinsic variability also contaminates the x - ray flux ratios . to account for this ,",
    "we estimated the variability structure function of the ( sparsely sampled ) x - ray light curves and then conservatively assumed a 30  day time delay , yielding an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1  magnitudes in the x - ray flux ratios . this additional systematic uncertainty limited the precision of our monte carlo analysis , but it can not be avoided until the time delay is measured .      using the same technique that we described in detail in @xcite , we applied the monte carlo microlensing analysis method of @xcite to the light curves from each trial time delay , in essence attempting to reproduce the observed lightcurves by random combinations of the unknown variables : the lens galaxy stellar mass fraction , the median microlens mass @xmath57 and the effective velocity between source , lens and observer @xmath58 .",

    "we did succeed , however , in effectively eliminating the possibility of positive values for the delay @xmath76 , which is an improvement over our earlier results in @xcite . nonetheless , the present probability density for the delay is ( at least ) double - valued .",

    "nevertheless , the monte carlo procedure allowed us to study the structure of the quasar with proper statistical weighting of the uncertainties created by the time delay , ultimately enabling a successful joint fit to the observed x - ray and optical lightcurves using our monte carlo method .    for the simultaneous optical and x - ray analysis , we employed the technique detailed in @xcite , in which a large number of good fits to the optical light curves are generated first . to enable better resolution at smaller angular scales",

    "we saved all physical variables from the good optical fits ( e.g. trajectory , effective transverse velocity @xmath86 ) and then fit the x - ray light curves using the same path across the magnification pattern but a different range of source sizes .",

    "[ fig : fits ] .",
    "we then analyze the combined x - ray and optical solutions to yield a set of joint probability densities for the variables of interest , namely the x - ray and optical source sizes .",
    "since the time delay was unknown , we performed this analysis for a range of assumed delays , but the x - ray size was insensitive to the resulting minor changes in the optical solutions .",

    "similar to our analysis in @xcite , the unknown time delay introduces short - timescale noise in the optical difference lightcurve that the monte carlo code can successfully reproduce using non - physical transverse velocities . to eliminate this non - physicality in our models , we applied a prior on the effective transverse velocity @xmath88 where @xmath89 is in einstein units . to convert all variables from einstein units of @xmath90 into physical units , we combined the resulting probability density for the effective transverse velocity @xmath91 with the distribution for the true transverse velocity @xmath92 .",

    "also , since microlensing statistics are actually sensitive to the projected area of the quasar s accretion disk , we must account for the unknown inclination angle @xmath113 .",

    ", the so - called `` flux - based '' thin disk scale radius is @xmath118 there is now significant evidence in the literature that flux(luminosity)-based size estimates are consistently smaller than microlensing - based measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and in @xcite , we found this to be true in 10 out of the 11 quasars in our sample .",
    "the one outlier in that sample was q  j01584325 , whose flux- and microlensing - based sizes were consistent .",

    "so in our new , more precise measurement , the flux - based size ( @xmath123 ) is now @xmath124  dex smaller than the microlensing - based size , consistent with the discrepancies in the other systems .",
    "probability densities for the half - light radii of the full , hard and soft x - ray continuum emission regions are also displayed in figure  [ fig : rs ] . since there is no simple spatial model for the x - ray continuum source , we report the x - ray sizes in terms of the half - light radius @xmath115 for x - ray emission at rest - frame energies 0.9 - 18.4  kev ( full band ) , @xmath125  kev ( soft band ) and 3.0 - 18.4  kev ( hard band ) .",
    "integration of the probability density for the combined hard and soft x - ray flux yields an estimate for the full band half light radius @xmath126 . the soft and hard size estimates are consistent with that of the full band and each other , where the half light radius for soft x - ray emission is @xmath0 and the upper limit on the half - light radius for hard x - ray emission is @xmath1 . because the pixel scale in our magnification patterns is @xmath127  cm for a 1  @xmath128 star , the lower limit on our x - ray size estimates is not fully resolved .",
    "in essence , once a trial source becomes much smaller than the pixel scale , all solutions become equally likely . in the case of the hard x - ray source , this prevented any convergence on a lower limit , so we also compiled a probability density for the ratio between the soft and hard x - ray half - light radii @xmath129 .",

    "while our new measurement is statistically consistent with our previous estimate , the new expectation value is nearly 0.6  dex larger than our original analysis and has nearly twice the precision .",
    "we attribute this difference to two effects .",
    "first , while we failed to measure the time delay , the new data substantially reduced the allowed range to @xmath48  days  @xmath136  days , leading to a significant narrowing of the source size probability density .",
    "flux ratios estimated for an incorrect delay have extra power on short time scales which the model tries to fit using a more compact source size , leading to a broadening of the source size distribution toward smaller sizes . since the time delay signal with our four new seasons of monitoring data has effectively ruled out positive delays , there are fewer cases in which the monte carlo code successfully reproduced the noise from an incorrect delay using a small accretion disk size .",
    "second , the simultaneous analysis of the ( admittedly ) sparse x - ray light curves provides a very strong constraint on the effective velocity distribution @xmath86 , which , in turn , constrains @xmath137 .",
    "@xcite gained similar statistical leverage from the use of x - ray photometry in their analysis .",
    "we have made significant improvements in our understanding of the qj01584325 continuum source , but we are still unable to measure the time delay",
    ". this may be due to inadequacies in our data or techniques , such as uncertainties in our photometric measurements and/or insufficient signal from the time delay compared to the signal from microlensing , or it could possibly be due to our oversimplification of the accretion disk model .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrate that general relativistic effects become important during caustic crossing events and can explain high - magnification features in the light curves of sbs  1520 + 530 and q  2237 + 0305 .",
    "several such features are present in the light curves of q  j01584325 and are not perfectly fit by our present analysis . to be fair , the results of @xcite require disks with large inclination angles , and we see no evidence for this in q  j01584325 .",
    "nevertheless , we are left to conclude that the modeling of high - amplitude microlensing events may be improved by the inclusion of a fully relativistic disk model or a more sophisticated model for the motions of stars in the lens galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at x - ray wavelengths , a consistent picture of the structure of the quasar continuum emission region is beginning to emerge .",
    "in the four systems with quantitatively measured continuum emission regions , he  04351223 @xcite , rxj  11311231 @xcite , pg  1115 + 080 @xcite and now qj  01584325 , the x - ray continuum emission source is located at @xmath138 . improving on our previous work",
