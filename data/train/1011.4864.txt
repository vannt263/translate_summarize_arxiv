    "a branching random walk is a collection of points which , starting from a single point , diffuse and branch independently of the time , of their positions or of the other points , as in figure  [ fig : brw ] .        branching random walks appear in many contexts ranging from mathematics @xcite to biology @xcite .",
    "they can for example be used to describe how a growing population invades a new environment . in the one dimensional case ,",
    "see figure  [ fig : brw ] , there is , at a given time @xmath0 , a rightmost individual at position @xmath1 , a second rightmost at @xmath2 and so on .",
    "( note that the rightmost @xmath3 at a time @xmath4 is not necessarily a descendant of the rightmost @xmath1 at time @xmath0 . )",
    "the expected position @xmath5 of the rightmost individual as well as the probability distribution of its position @xmath1 around @xmath6 are well understood @xcite ; the goal of the present paper is to describe the statistical properties of the positions of all the rightmost points in the system , in particular the distribution of the distances between the two rightmost points , the average density of points at some fixed distance from the rightmost @xmath1 , etc .",
    "one motivation for studying these distances is that the problem belongs to the broader context of extreme value statistics @xcite : trying to understand the statistical properties of the rightmost points in a random set of points on the line is a problem common to the studies of the largest eigenvalues of random matrices @xcite , of the extrema of random signals @xcite , or of the low lying states of some disordered systems such as spin glasses @xcite . in fact , the points generated after some time @xmath0 by a branching random walk can be viewed as the energies of the configurations of a directed polymer in a random medium @xcite , and the distances between the rightmost points as the gaps between the low lying energy states .",
    "the most studied example of branching random walk is the branching brownian motion : one starts with a single point at the origin which performs a brownian motion and branches at a given fixed rate ( right part of figure  [ fig : brw ] ) .",
    "whenever a branching event occurs , the point is replaced by two new points which evolve themselves as two independent branching brownian motions .",
    "while the number of points generated after some time @xmath0 grows exponentially with time , the expected position @xmath6 of the rightmost point increases only linearly with time @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "mc kean @xcite and bramson @xcite have shown that the probability distribution of the rightmost point is given by the traveling wave solution of the fisher - kpp equation , with a step initial condition . here",
    "we will see that all the statistical properties of the rightmost points can be understood in terms of solutions to the fisher - kpp equation with appropriate initial conditions @xcite .",
    "we will also show that the distribution of the distances between these rightmost points has a long time limit which exhibits the striking property of superposability : the distances between the rightmost points of the union of two realizations of the branching brownian motion have the same statistics as those of a single realization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ statistics ] we introduce some generating functions useful to study random sets of points on the line and show how one can use them to obtain all the properties of these random sets . in section  [ sec : bbmfkpp ] we show that , for the branching brownian motion , all these generating functions are solutions of the fisher - kpp equation .",
    "we also show that the distribution of all the rightmost points as seen from @xmath6 or , alternatively , as seen from @xmath1 , has a long time limit which can be computed as the delay of fisher - kpp traveling waves .",
    "this distribution has the property of superposability . in section  [ quantitative ] ,",
    "we present results , mostly numerical , on some specific aspects of the limiting distribution of points in the branching brownian motion , namely the distribution of the distance between the two rightmost points and the average density seen from the rightmost point . in section  [ sec : disc ] we explain how the results on the branching brownian motion can be extended to more general branching random walks .",
    "finally , we study in section  [ statmeas ] the distribution of all the rightmost points in a specific frame which depends on the realization and which was introduced by lalley and sellke @xcite .",
    "in this section , we introduce some useful quantities ( generating functions ) to characterize random sets of points on the line such that the number @xmath7 defined as @xmath8 is finite and vanishes for @xmath9 large enough .      the first generating function one can define is @xmath10 from the knowledge of this function , one can extract the probability distribution function @xmath11 of the position @xmath9 of the @xmath12-th rightmost point .",
    "indeed , by definition of @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability that there are exactly @xmath12 points on the right of @xmath9 . one can notice that @xmath16 is the probability to have less than @xmath12 points on the right of @xmath9 .",
    "the generating function of these sums is , from , @xmath17\\lambda^2+\\big[q_0(x)+q_1(x)+q_2(x)\\big]\\lambda^3+\\cdots . \\label{sumterms}\\ ] ] but @xmath16 is also the probability that the @xmath12-th rightmost point , if it exists , is on the left of @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the probability that the @xmath12-th rightmost point exists and is in the interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "( note that @xmath21 is the probability that there are at least @xmath12 points on the line . )",
    "the knowledge of @xmath22 gives in particular the average distances between the points : from ( [ pix ] ) , one can see that @xmath23,\\notag\\\\ & = \\langle x_1 \\rangle-\\lambda[\\langle x_1 \\rangle-\\langle x_2 \\rangle ] -\\lambda^2[\\langle x_2 \\rangle-\\langle x_3 \\rangle]-\\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the average position of the @xmath12-th point ( with the convention that @xmath25 if there are less than @xmath12 points in the system ) . therefore @xmath26 = \\sum_{i\\ge1 } \\langle d_{i , i+1}\\rangle \\lambda^i , \\label{psid}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the average distance between the @xmath12-th and the @xmath28-th point .    to obtain the correlations between the positions of pairs of points ,",
    "one can start , for @xmath29 , from the generating function @xmath30 the coefficient in front of @xmath31 in the expansion of @xmath32 in powers of @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the probability that there are exactly @xmath12 points on the right of @xmath9 and @xmath35 points on the right of @xmath36 . as in , the coefficient of @xmath31 in the expansion of @xmath37 is the probability that there are less than @xmath12 points on the right of @xmath9 and less than @xmath35 points on the right of @xmath36 , which is also the probability that the @xmath12-th rightmost point ( if it exists ) is on the left of @xmath9 and the @xmath35-th rightmost point ( if it exists ) is on the left of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , for @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the probability that both the @xmath12-th and @xmath35-th rightmost points exist and lie respectively in the intervals @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] .    one can generalize ( [ defpsi],[defpsi2 ] ) by defining , for @xmath42 , the generating functions @xmath43 of the numbers @xmath44 of points on the right of positions @xmath45 , and get as in ( [ pix],[twopoint ] ) all the higher correlation functions . in that way ,",
    "all the statistical properties of the measure can be derived from the knowledge of the generating functions ( [ defpsi3 ] ) .      in the following",
    "we will often try to characterize the random set of points as seen from the rightmost point ( i.e. in the frame where the rightmost point is at the origin ) . to do so , let us define the generating functions of the numbers @xmath46 of points at the right of @xmath47 in the frame of the rightmost point .",
    "( note that if @xmath48 is the position of the rightmost , then @xmath49 and one has @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 . )",
    "@xmath54 ( as in , we assume @xmath55 . ) these generating functions , as in section [ generating - functions ] , allow one to calculate all the statistical properties of the measure in the frame of the rightmost point ( in particular the distribution of the relative distances between the points ) .",
    "they can be determined from the knowledge of the generating functions @xmath56 defined in ( [ defpsi3 ] ) by @xmath57    in section [ quantitative ] we will calculate the density of probability @xmath58 that the two rightmost points are separated by a distance @xmath59 ( and that there are at least two points on the line ) and the average density @xmath60 at a distance @xmath59 from the rightmost point . from ( [ defchi3 ] ) one can see that @xmath61 then using that @xmath62 , one gets @xmath63 by a similar calculation one can show that the average density @xmath60 of points at distance @xmath59 from the rightmost point is @xmath64      we now describe a few examples of such measures .",
    "our first example is a poisson process on the line with a density @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that @xmath65 decays fast enough to the right so that a rightmost point exists , and that @xmath66 so that there are infinitely many points on the line .",
    "by definition of a poisson process , each infinitesimal interval @xmath20 $ ] is occupied by a point with probability @xmath67 and empty with probability @xmath68 , and the occupation numbers of disjoint intervals are uncorrelated .",
    "the probability @xmath15 that there are exactly @xmath12 points on the right of @xmath9 is given by @xmath69 from this , we obtain @xmath22 from ( [ defpsi],[exppsi ] ) and @xmath70 from ( [ defpsi2 ] ) in the poisson process : @xmath71 using , the generating function of the average @xmath72 between the @xmath12-th and @xmath28-th points is @xmath73.\\ ] ] the probability distribution function @xmath58 that the distance @xmath74 is equal to @xmath59 and the average density @xmath60 seen at a distance @xmath59 from the rightmost point are given by @xmath75 these expressions can be understood directly from the definition of the poisson process or , with a little more algebra , from ( [ p12],[rho ] ) . one can notice that @xmath58 and @xmath60 are given by the same expression with @xmath59 replaced by @xmath76 and are therefore analytic continuations of each other whenever @xmath65 is analytic .      in the special case where the density of the poisson process is an exponential @xmath78 , one can simply replace @xmath79 in the previous expressions by @xmath80 .",
    "this gives @xmath81       = \\exp \\left [ -e^{-\\alpha \\big(x - \\frac{\\ln(1-      \\lambda)}\\alpha\\big)}\\right ] , \\\\",

    "the expressions for @xmath58 and @xmath60 are however the same as in for the pure poisson process of density @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , all the statistical properties of the distances between the rightmost points are the same as those in the exponential poisson process .",
    "this can be understood from the following reason : decorating the points @xmath96 by independent realizations of a poisson process of density @xmath94 is equivalent to drawing a single realization of a poisson process of density @xmath97 , which is just the same as one realization of a poisson process of density @xmath94 shifted by the random variable @xmath98 .",
    "the same argument applies to ruelle cascades , which can be defined as follows @xcite : take an increasing sequence of positive numbers @xmath99 and start with a poisson process of density @xmath100 . at each step",
    "@xmath101 , each point in the system is decorated by a poisson process of density @xmath102 . at step @xmath103 , the measure of points in the system is simply , from the previous argument , a poisson process of density @xmath102 globally shifted by a random variable which depends on the positions of the points at step @xmath104 .",

    "this means that one can group the rightmost points into families where two points belong to the same family if the branching event that generated them occurred recently .",
    "the branching brownian motion could then be a decorated exponential poisson process , where the rightmost points of all the families are poisson distributed with an exponential density @xcite and where the members of a given family form the decoration .",
    "this interpretation helps to understand a question raised by our previous work @xcite : the distances between points in the branching brownian motion are given by ( [ asympdi],[valuesdn ] ) , but if one considers only the rightmost point of each family , then the distances are given by with @xmath292 , as in the grem or in the ruelle cascade , see section  [ ruellecascade ] .",

    "the distribution of the positions of the rightmost points seen in the frame @xmath6 ( the average position of the rightmost ) has a long time limit .",
    "the properties of the limiting distribution can be expressed as the long time delays of the traveling wave solution of the fisher - kpp equation when one varies the initial condition .",

    "if one considers , however , only the distances between the points , for example if one looks at the distribution of all the positions of the rightmost points seen in the frame of the rightmost one , one obtains at large times another limiting distribution which does not depend on the initial positions of the branching brownian motions ( as long as there are finitely many of them ) .",

    "[ quantitative ] we have measured a few properties of this limiting distribution , and in section  [ sec : disc ] we explained how our results can be extended to more general branching random walks .",
    "lastly , in section  [ statmeas ] , we argued that in the lalley and sellke frame , the branching brownian motion satisfies a stronger version of the superposability property , see  .    in the future , it would be interesting to characterize more precisely the limiting measure of the branching brownian motion and of the branching random walks to see whether some universal properties emerge .",
