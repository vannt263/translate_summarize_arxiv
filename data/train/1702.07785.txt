    "however , the peak at @xmath80 has a different absolute value of the intensity when changing the sign of the dipole - dipole interaction ( as indicated by the dashed blue line and the unfilled dots ) .",
    "the effect of pulse width on the peak amplitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_width_peakheight ] .",
    "here we kept the ` pulse - area ' @xmath93 constant when changing the pulse width .",

    "as expected the 1hd spectrum has a very weak dependence on the pulse width .",
    "essentially it reflects strength of the pulse - spectrum at the field strength of the respective transition .",
    "the decrease at large pulse width comes from the fact that the spectral width of the pulse ( which scales as @xmath95 ) becomes comparable to the energetic separation between the transition frequency and the central frequency of the laser .",
    "it is remarkable that the peak amplitude in the 2hd has a very strong dependence on the pulse width . in particular , for short pulse - width ( i.e.  large bandwidth of the pulse ) the peak - amplitudes are decreasing for decreasing pulse - width .",
    "this effect is related to the curvature ( and magnitude ) of the pulse - spectrum at the frequency of the relevant transitions .",
    "in addition it also depends in a non - trivial way on the difference between the pulse - spectrum at the ` two - photon transition ' ( i.e.  @xmath96 ) and the pulse - spectrum at the ` one - photon transition ' . in the appendix analytic calculations for rectangular pulses",
    "are performed in the perturbative regime with respect to the electric field ( times transition dipole ) . from these results ( in particular eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1st_comp_app])([eq:2nd_12comp_app ] ) ) one sees that for the case when the detuning of the laser with respect to the single particle transitions is large compared to the dipole - dipole interaction , then the amplitude of the peaks consists of the product of two parts : one part leads to a ` trivial ' scaling ( electric field @xmath97 pulse width)@xmath98 , where @xmath99 for 1hd and @xmath100 for 2hd . the normalization of the electric field strength used in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse_width_peakheight ] keeps this factor constant .",
    "the second factor does for the 1hd signal in leading order not depend on the dipole - dipole interaction and approaches one for decreasing pulse width . for the 2hd signal however , the leading term depends linearly on the dipole - dipole interaction ( as we also found numerically in fig .

    "high repetition rate lasers have been used .",
    "the repetition rate is faster than the radiative lifetime of a single potassium atom .",

    "such an effect is discussed in ref .   for the case of a two - photon transition . in experiment",
    "not two atoms at a well - defined distance are addressed but the laser interacts with a large number of atoms in a gas . in our estimations",
    "we have assumed that the dominant contributions come from nearest neighbours and simply considered the average nearest neighbor distance . in a more detailed calculation",
    "one has to average over distances and relative orientations ( also the assumption that the two atoms see the same field at a certain time is no longer correct , since the distance between the atoms is much larger than the wavelength ) .",
    "note that depending on the relative orientation one can have positive and negative values of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "regarding the orientation of the transition dipoles some additional care is necessary . for atoms the transition dipoles are not simple vectors . and in particular for the dipole - dipole interaction one has to take the detailed level substructure into account ( see e.g.  the discussions in refs .   and  ) . in our theoretical modelling",
    "we have ignored correlation effects in the emission ( like stimulated emission or superradiance ) .",
    "finally , our modelling of the measurement procedure might not be correct and in experiment the measurement apparatus performs a two particle measurement ( as suggested in ref .  ) .",
    "in this work , we have investigated systematically the collective excitations of particles probed via phase - modulated wave packet interferometry within the framework of a one - body measurement operator .",
    "we have focused on two particles that can exchange interaction via transition dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the laser - pulses had frequencies overlapping with the transition frequencies of the individual particles .",
    "we developed analytical formulas for the ( de)modulated signals in terms of a single- and double - interaction pulse spectral amplitudes .",
    "we obtained analytical results for rectangular pulses and presented fully numerical simulation for gaussian pulses .",
    "below we summarize our main findings :    the peak positions in the 1hd spectra are shifted with respect to the position of the non - interacting particles by the energy of the dipole - dipole interaction . in contrast , in the 2hd they are always at the constant frequencies @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the complex 1hd spectrum has the typical features of absorption and dispersion : peaks appear in the real part ( of the complex spectrum ) and the corresponding dispersion is in the imaginary part .",
    "however , for the 2hd spectrum there is an important difference : peaks appear in the imaginary part and dispersion - like features are in the real part . if one want to have a similar functional form as the 1hd feature ( to interpret the signal as absorption and dispersion ) one has to multiply the 2hd by a phase - factor .",
    "this phase factor depends on the sign of the interaction ; it is @xmath81 for positive dipole - dipole coupling and by @xmath82 for negative dipole - dipole interaction .    for the amplitudes of the 2hd spectrum we found a linear dependence with respect to the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we found a strong effect of the pulse - shape on the peak amplitude in the 2hd .",
    "in particular we found that it has a non - monotonic behaviour as a function of pulse width .",
    "for delta - pulses the 2hd signal vanishes .",
    "let us briefly comment on some of our approximations . in the present work we have neglected all decoherence effects .",
    "we expect that this is a good approximation , as long as the linewidth of the transitions of the individual atoms is small compared to the bandwidth of the pulses . in the present treatment",
    "all correlations in the field have been neglected . for example stimulated emission or dicke - superradiance could have an effect on the observed fluorescence @xcite .    in the present work we have tried to follow the experimental procedure of ref .",
    "as closely as possible .",
    "however , instead of sampling with @xmath160 and performing a demodulation one can also employ a phase - cycling scheme , experimentally as well as numerically .",
    "in particular in the numerics this will give a considerable speed up and one can still treat non - perturbative effects and arbitrary pulse - shapes",
    ". however , it will be difficult to treat effects specific to the demodulation procedure .",
    "for example in the present numerical approach one can model the lock - in amplifier in more detail or consider the effect of fast pulse repetition compared to the decay time of the particles",
    ".    finally , let us note that our results indicate that phase modulation approach with higher order demodulation offers a possibility to detect weak interactions between particles when there is strong inhomogeneous broadening present .",
    "this is based on the fact that in the 2hd spectra dipole - dipole interaction manifests itself not in a line - shift ( which is difficult to extract from a broadened spectrum ) , but from a peak amplitude .",
    "in order to have a better understanding of physics behind and gain some insights from analytical results one would like to evaluate the various @xmath161 of eqs .",
