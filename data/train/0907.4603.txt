    "<S> we analyze transitions between quantum hall ground states at prominent filling factors @xmath0 in the spherical geometry by tuning the width parameter of the zhang - das sarma interaction potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that incompressible ground states evolve adiabatically under this tuning , whereas the compressible ones are driven through a first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> overlap calculations show that the resulting phase is increasingly well described by appropriate analytic model wavefunctions ( laughlin , moore - read , read - rezayi ) . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is shared by both odd ( @xmath1 ) and even denominator states ( @xmath2 ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the fermi liquid - like state at @xmath3 gives way , at large enough value of the width parameter , to an incompressible state identified as the moore - read pfaffian on the basis of its entanglement spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> we address in this work , via large - scale exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculations on finite spheres , the important and interesting question of how to tune various fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) ground states between ungapped compressible and gapped incompressible phases by continuously varying the effective electron - electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> such numerical studies have been a standard theoretical tool in fqh physics since the beginning@xcite because of the non - perturbative nature of the fqh ground states . in the current work , which is complementary to the pseudopotential description of quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) in quantum hall systems as pioneered by morf@xcite and haldane,@xcite we report that a simple single - parameter parametrization of the effective interaction through the so - called zhang - das sarma ( zds ) model@xcite provides a flexible and powerful method of studying qpts between compressible and incompressible phases at both even and odd denominator fqh states . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that zds interaction possesses a rich structure that can drive the fqh system from parameter regions where it appears to be compressible ( manifested by the ground state that breaks rotational invariance i.e. the value of angular momentum @xmath4 ) towards the incompressible region where the ground state is rotationally invariant ( @xmath5 ) , along with the corresponding overlap with the trial states like laughlin@xcite or paired states ( moore - read pfaffian@xcite , read - rezayi@xcite etc . ) jumping to a value close to unity and an energy gap opening up in the excitation spectrum . in agreement with the experimental phenomenology , we find that the well - known ( small ) odd - denominator incompressible fqh states ( e.g. 1/3 , 1/5 , 7/3 , 11/5 ) are robust and usually do not manifest any interaction - tuned qpt whereas the more fragile , even denominator ( e.g. 1/2 , 1/4 , 5/2 , 9/4 ) fqh states typically exhibit characteristic qpt from a compressible to an incompressible phase as the coulomb interaction is softened by increasing the zds tuning parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are performed in the spherical geometry introduced and described in detail by haldane,@xcite here we make only a few essential comments . </S>",
    "<S> we consider spin to be fully polarized and use the zds model interaction which was originally proposed to study the finite thickness effect of the quasi two - dimensional layer,@xcite but in our analysis , the thickness parameter @xmath6 ( expressed in units of the rescaled magnetic length , @xmath7 ) enters simply as the tuning parameter for the hamiltonian :    @xmath8    we emphasize that the zds interaction ( [ zds_interaction ] ) appears to have the same qualitative pseudopotential decomposition as the realistic models ( e.g. the fang - howard , infinite square well , etc . ) , as has recently been shown in details in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was also observed in ref .   that realistic confinement models do not always reproduce the qpts induced by the zds interaction , suggesting there may be subtle quantitative differences between zds and alternative confinement models which are important in the vicinity of a qpt . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the zds model in carrying out our ed studies since a single parameter enables us to study fqh qpts in a compact manner . in order to establish the connection with the experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we should mention that @xmath6 in the zds model corresponds roughly to the root - mean - square fluctuation in the electron coordinate in the transverse direction.@xcite    with this choice of the interaction , we use the overlap between the exact , numerically diagonalized finite system , and a candidate analytical wavefunction ( e.g. the laughlin or the moore - read wavefunction ) to determine the tentative quantum phase of the system , i.e. if the overlap is ` large ' ( ` small ' ) , the system is supposed to be in the candidate state ( or not ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the overlap as a continuous function of the varying hamiltonian which is being tuned by @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> all the model wave functions studied in this paper are jack polynomials that have squeezable configurations@xcite which can be efficiently generated and compared with the exact ground state . </S>",
    "<S> note that each fqh state on a finite sphere at the filling factor @xmath0 is characterized , beside the number of electrons @xmath9 and the number of flux quanta @xmath10 , also by a topological invariant @xmath11 called shift , defined by @xmath12 in the thermodynamic limit of an infinite plane , the shift plays no role , but for a finite _ sphere _ it is a crucial aspect of the ed technique@xcite as it can lead to an  </S>",
    "<S> aliasing\"@xcite problem : at a fixed choice of @xmath13 , more than one quantum hall state ( having different @xmath0 , @xmath11 and , therefore , different physical properties ) may be realized . </S>",
    "<S> to avoid such loss of uniqueness for finite sphere ed , we disregard the aliased states from our considerations . notwithstanding </S>",
    "<S> the aliasing problem , the system sizes we analyze are the largest that can be presently handled in ed studies .    </S>",

    "<S> , certain particle numbers yield zero overlap for @xmath18 ( for @xmath21 particles , the ground state is obtained in @xmath22 sector , therefore the overlap with the laughlin wave function is zero due to the difference in symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> things change once the zds potential is turned on : the states which are homogeneous ( @xmath5 ) increase their overlap , while the finite - size artefact @xmath21 undergoes a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) turning into an @xmath5 state just under @xmath23 .     between the exact coulomb state for finite width ( zds model ) at @xmath15 and the laughlin wave function for @xmath24 particles . </S>",
    "<S> inset : same quantity but in the first excited landau level i.e. @xmath25 . ]    it will be shown in what follows that the induced qpt for @xmath26 is not an exceptional case.@xcite even denominator fractions , such as @xmath27 which is believed to be the moore - read pfaffian@xcite or the recently discovered @xmath28,@xcite and various paired states of the read - rezayi sequence@xcite like @xmath29 , attract considerable attention because of their unusual ground states and the exotic spectrum of excitations that may be utilized in topological quantum computation.@xcite while their realization in the sll seems a likely possibility , there has been little expectation to observe them in the conditions of the lll ( see however ref  . ) . in particular , at the thin single - layer @xmath3 in the lll only the compressible , fermi - liquid like state has been observed . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_onehalf ] we show the overlap results of finite - size calculations on @xmath3 in the lll and @xmath27 in the sll with zds interaction .     between the exact coulomb state for finite width ( zds model ) at @xmath3 and the pfaffian for @xmath30 particles . </S>",

    "<S> certain particle numbers yield good overlap already for zero thickness and their overlap will improve as @xmath6 increases . </S>",
    "<S> other particle numbers produce ground states with well - defined values of @xmath33 that undergo a qpt at a critical value of the thickness . for @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb ground state for zero thickness is already reasonably well approximated@xcite by the moore - read pfaffian and the effect of zds interaction is only to increase the overlap in a smooth way . </S>",
    "<S> however , the increase is substantial  up to @xmath34 for the largest system amenable to ed . </S>",
    "<S> this adiabatic continuity of the moore - read description for the sll @xmath27 has been discussed in ref .   and recently at great length by storni _ </S>",
    "<S> _ et al.__@xcite    the non - zero values of @xmath35 that appear at @xmath3 in the lll can be fully understood from the cf theory.@xcite indeed , former work hinted at the possibility of @xmath36wave paired cf state as a result of cf sea being perturbed by zds interaction.@xcite however , in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> only the variational energies of trial states were compared . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_cfsea ] we will show that one can establish a connection between the zds - induced qpt and the pfaffian and cf sea states in the lll at @xmath3 .     between the exact coulomb state for finite width ( zds model ) at @xmath3 and the cf sea state defined to be exact coulomb ground state for zero thickness . </S>",
    "<S> red circles represent filled cf shells ( @xmath37 ) , blue triangles are the lowest excited states @xmath38 and so on . ]    because the cf sea state and the moore - read pfaffian occur at different shifts on the sphere ( -2 and -3 , respectively ) , one can not simultaneously study their evolution with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , by analyzing the excitations of cf sea occuring at the pfaffian shift , one can show ( using hund s rule ) that the @xmath35 values obtained in ed _ at the pfaffian shift _ </S>",
    "<S> ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_onehalf ] ) are indeed those stemming from the cf sea excitations . moreover , assuming that the coulomb ground state in the lll for zero thickness is exceedingly well approximated by rezayi - read wave function,@xcite we define the cf sea state for our purposes as the interacting coulomb ground state for zero thickness and study its overlap with the @xmath39 ground states , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_cfsea ] . </S>",
    "<S> cf theory tells us that ( at the shift of -2 ) the @xmath5 configurations are obtained when the cf shells are completely filled i.e. for @xmath40 these configurations are particularly robust and adding / subtracting electrons from them ( @xmath41 ) creates a configuration that is destroyed at some critical value of the width which depends on how far away the system is from the filled shell . obviously , there is ambiguity in defining precisely the critical width where the cf sea is destroyed , but this argument nonetheless provides further support for the claim that the zds - induced compressible  </S>",
    "<S> incompressible transition indeed proceeds via destruction of cf sea towards the moore - read pfaffian . </S>",
    "<S> transition of the same kind can be relevant for the multicomponent candidates@xcite at @xmath42 we emphasize that the possible finite - width - induced lll @xmath3 fqh state that we find arising out of the destabilization of the cf sea , even if it exists , is likely to be extremely fragile with a neutral excitation gap smaller than @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , numerically extrapolated gap is generally known to be difficult to relate to the experimental value@xcite and in our data we can not rule out the possibility that it goes to zero in thermodynamic limit .    another way to look at the qpt towards the moore - read pfaffian is to analyze the entanglement spectrum proposed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> this is a powerful way to identify topological order in the given ground state wave function and establish a direct connection with the underlying cft that produces the given ground state as its correlator and thus offering more information than the simple overlap calculation.@xcite in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_entspectrum_16 ] we show the change in the entanglement spectrum for @xmath44 particles at @xmath3 in the lll , before and after qpt . for @xmath45 , there is no visible cft branch in the entanglement spectrum  </S>",
    "<S> the generic coulomb part dominates , leading to a likely compressible ground state . after the qpt , a cft branch separates from the coulomb part of the spectrum and the level counting begins to match the first few virasoro levels of the ising cft . </S>",
    "<S> this is additional evidence in favor of the possibility of a finite - width - induced qpt to an incompressible half - filled single - layer lll fqh state .     </S>",
    "<S> particles at @xmath3 in the lll , just before ( @xmath46 ) and after ( @xmath47 ) the qpt , and the spectrum of moore - read pfaffian for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> vertical axes show the quantity @xmath48 , where @xmath49 are the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath50 which comprises of @xmath51 particles and @xmath52 orbitals , given as a function of angular momentum @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> , other sectors give a similar result . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the effect of zds potential on other even denominator and paired states . in the lll </S>",
    "<S> , a qpt is induced for @xmath28@xcite around @xmath55 and for read - rezayi @xmath56 state around @xmath57 . in the sll , </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath58 state is similarly stabilized when zds parameter is around @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> our work establishes that the continuous tuning of the interaction through the zds hamiltonian enables a direct study of fqh quantum phase transitions showing that the usual odd denominator states are robust in both the lll and the sll , whereas the fragile even denominator fqh states are stable only in a regime of the interaction strength where the bare electron - electron interaction is considerably softer than the pure 2d coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the zds interaction allows for the existence of non - abelian incompressible fqh states even at unusual even fractions such as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , raising the intriguing possibility that such exotic non - abelian states may indeed exist if one can sufficiently soften the interaction along the zds prescription . </S>",
    "<S> whether this can be physically achieved in 2d semiconductor systems remains an interesting open question and may require some ` reverse engineering ' of the quasi-2d samples to achieve a suitable density profile using the fact that the width parameter in the zds model corresponds roughly to the variance of the electron position in the transverse direction . </S>"
