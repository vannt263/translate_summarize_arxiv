    "of paramount importance for the theory of disordered systems and the concept of anderson localization @xcite is the scaling theory of localization as proposed in 1979 @xcite . especially in 2d , this theory predicts the absence of a disorder - driven mit for generic situations such that all states remain localized and the system is an insulator @xcite .",
    "however , already early @xcite it was suggested that an anderson model of localization with purely off - diagonal disorder might violate this general statement since non - localized states were found at the band center @xcite .",
    "further numerical investigations in recent years @xcite have uncovered additional evidence that the localization properties at @xmath0 are special .",
    "in particular , it was found that the divergence in the density of states dos is accompanied by a divergence of the localization lengths @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this divergence does not violate the scaling arguments @xcite , since it can be shown that its scaling properties are compatible with critical states only @xcite , i.e. , there are no truly extended states at @xmath0 . of importance for the model is a very special symmetry around @xmath0 which holds in the bipartite case of an even number of sites @xcite .",
    "then the spectrum is symmetric such that for every eigenenergy @xmath2 there is also a state with energy @xmath3 .",
    "this situation is connected with a so - called chiral universality class .",
    "furthermore , the model is closely connected to the random flux model studied in the quantum - hall situation where the off - diagonal disorder is due to a random magnetic flux through the 2d plaquettes .",
    "thus although we do not have a true mit , we nevertheless have a transition from localized via delocalized to localized behavior as we sweep the energy through @xmath0 .",
    "we consider a single electron on the 2d lattice with @xmath4 sites described by the anderson hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the electron at site @xmath7 .",
    "the onsite energies @xmath8 are set to @xmath9 and the off - diagonal disorder is introduced by choosing random hopping elements @xmath10 between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "we test three different distributions of @xmath10 :    1 .   a rectangular distribution @xcite @xmath11 2 .   a gaussian distribution @xmath12,\\ ] ] 3 .   a rectangular distribution of the logarithm of @xmath10 @xcite @xmath13    the logarithmic distribution appears more suited to model actual physical systems @xcite .",
    "we also note that the logarithmic distribution avoids problems with zero @xmath14 elements and thus there is no need to introduce an artificial lower cutoff as for the box and gaussian distributions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the box and gaussian distributions will usually have negative @xmath14 values which correspond to a rather artificial phase shift .    in the case of rectangular and normal distributions",
    "we set the width @xmath15 and the standard deviation @xmath16 to @xmath17 and change the center @xmath18 of the distribution . in the case of the logarithmic @xmath14",
    "distribution @xmath19 sets the energy scale and we change the disorder width @xmath15 .",
    "values of the parameters were @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 for the rectangular distribution ; @xmath20 and @xmath24 for the gaussian distribution and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for the logarithmic @xmath14 distribution .",
    "the transfer - matrix method @xcite was used to compute the localization lengths for strips of various widths @xmath29 up to @xmath30 in the energy interval @xmath31 . in figs .",
    "[ fig - c000b ] , [ fig - c000bo ] , [ fig - c025 g ] , and [ fig - w020l ] we show the system size dependence for , e.g. , special values of @xmath18 and @xmath15 and all three disorder distributions . the accuracy of our results is @xmath32 or @xmath33 depending on the disorder distribution and the values of parameters , see table [ tab - exp ] for actual parameter values .",
    "next , the finite - size - scaling analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite was applied to the data .",
    "the calculated localization lengths usually increase as the energy approaches @xmath9 .",
    "only , for small even width values ( @xmath34 ) it decreases significantly close to @xmath0 @xcite which makes finite - size scaling impossible .",
    "therefore the smallest system sizes were dropped during the finite - size scaling procedure .",
    "results for the finite - size scaling curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - fss ] for the three different distributions .",
    "one expects that the scaling parameters @xmath35 obtained from finite - size scaling diverge close to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "however , the precise functional form of this divergence is not yet know . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that for energies @xmath36 the divergence can be described by a power law as @xmath37 with the critical exponent @xmath38 . for even smaller @xmath39 , this behavior should then change to @xmath40 with constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 given by the renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "double - logarithmic plots of @xmath35 vs.  @xmath43 in figs .",
    "[ fig - ri ] , [ fig - gi ] and [ fig - li ] confirm the power - law behavior with reasonable accuracy down to @xmath44 . for smaller values it has been shown already in ref",
    ".  @xcite that a new behavior is to be expected .",
    "table [ tab - exp ] collects the values of the critical exponent obtained for different disorders . in the case of the logarithmic @xmath14 distribution and @xmath45",
    "the power - law divergence fails , therefore the exponent was not calculated . from table",
    "[ tab - exp ] , it can be easily seen that all calculated values are in the range @xmath46 .",
    "the exponent is apparently not universal but seems to depend on the kind of disorder and the actual value of parameters ; for stronger disorders @xmath38 becomes smaller ( for the logarithmic @xmath14 distribution the disorder strength increases with @xmath15 @xcite , for the rectangular distribution the strongest disorder appears at @xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "this non - universality is in agreement with the results of ref .",
    ".    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     as the localization lengths calculated for odd and even strip widths may exhibit different behavior @xcite we repeated the calculations also for odd - width systems for chosen parameter sets for all distributions . fig .  [ fig - c000bo ]",
    "shows an example of reduced localization lenghts for rectangular distribution . in contrast to the even - width systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig - c000b ] ) the localization lengths do not decrease significantly close to the @xmath0 .",
    "we have attributed the different behaviors for odd and even system sizes to different structures in the density of states @xcite . nevertheless , the exponent in both cases is within the error bars the same ( cp .",
    "table [ tab - exp ] ) .",
    "this is also true for gaussian and logarithmic disorder distributions ( see table [ tab - exp ] ) , therefore , at least for the investigated disorder strengths , the difference in exponents of localization lengths is negligible .",
    "our results suggest that the localization - delocalization - localization present in the off - diagonal anderson model of localization in 2d can be described by a set of exponents that model the divergence of the localization lengths @xmath35 at @xmath0 .",
    "note that these exponents are in reasonable agreement with the exponent @xmath22 first estimated for the scaling of the participation numbers in ref .",
    "@xcite . down to @xmath47 in figs .",
    "[ fig - ri ] , [ fig - gi ] the power - law behavior can model the data reasonably well . thus we expect the crossover predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite to appear at smaller energies .",
    "we find that the exponents depend on the strength and distribution of the off - diagonal disorder also in agreement with ref .",
    "currently , we are extending these calculations to smaller energies .",
    "we note that it might be interesting to also investigate the situation in honeycomb lattices @xcite , where the van hove singularity of the square lattice at @xmath0 does not interfere with the divergence due to the bipartiteness which is of interest here .",
    "we thank m.  fabrizio for stimulating discussions . we gratefully acknowledge support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb393 ) and the smwk ."
